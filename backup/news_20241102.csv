Ethereum Could Crash Over 60%, Analyst Says","Like most digital assets, Ethereum witnessed a correction this week by losing over 5% in the last 24 hours while trading just above $2,500. While the increased on-chain activity could eventually make the bulls bet for the bounce back of Ether, a few experts differ with this perspective. Crypto veteran analyst Peter Brandt predicts further downfall in Ether to the extent of loss of over 60% from its present price, with no indication of changing. Currently, Ether is trading at a 42-month low. While Bitcoin re-tested the $70k mark early this week, Ether maintains a sluggish price action and is too far off from the experts’ target of $4k.

Ether’s Strong Bearish Movement Ethereum trades at its 42-month low against the world’s top digital asset, which suggests a bearish momentum. Zooming out of the price chart, Ethereum is on a downward spiral and a painful market correction for holders and investors. According to Brandt, Ethereum’s bearish sentiment will continue with no reassuring signs of reversal. Interesting to note that there was not a buy signal in $ETH In fact, chart remains bearish with unmet target at 1551 pic.twitter.com/sjkXyTQXU2 — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) October 31, 2024 In a Twitter/X post, Brandt shared a graph saying there’s no but signal for Ether. He added that Ethereum’s chart is bearish, with the bulls making it difficult to hit the $1,551 target. The 1-day-chart highlights the asset’s continued bearish moment momentum that started last August, characterized by a descending channel. Ethereum’s bearish flag is terrible news for traders and holders, suggesting a continued downtrend. Analyst Sees Bearish Metrics For Ethereum Aside from the bearish signals on the graph, Brandt also noted a few discouraging metrics for Ethereum. For example, Ether has dropped by over 5% over the last 24 hours, registering a sharper decline than Solana, at -4.91%, and Bitcoin, at -3.87%. Also, Brandt noted that the ETH/BTC trading ratio dipped to 0.03613, a 42-month low, as BTC continues to lead the broader crypto market. Although Ethereum is currently priced at $2,507, Brandt sees the asset dipping even further to $1,551, reflecting a possible 62% decline from its current value. $1,551 As Ethereum’s Unmet Target Brandt sees $1,551 as the asset’s unmet target and a key milestone. In his analysis, this level serves as the holders’ point of capitulation. The recent dips in price have affected investors’ and holders’ confidence, with Ethereum struggling to sustain the $2,400 support.

However, Brandt offers a more bearish outlook for Ethereum, saying that the asset will go downhill unless a new set of technical indicators emerges.

Crypto analyst TradingShot revealed why this development was a positive going forward and is a good buy signal for those looking to invest in the flagship crypto. Related Reading: Ethereum Claims Address Dominance With 43% Lead—Will It Keep Rising? Bitcoin Triggers Buy Signal After Price Hit Second Green Month Candle TradingShot mentioned in a TradingView post that it is always a good signal to buy whenever the Bitcoin price closes two consecutive green monthly candles. He made this assertion based on the multi-year chart, which he also claimed shows that the market continues to rally whenever Bitcoin records these two straight green candles. The crypto analyst revealed that the Bitcoin price recorded three straight green candle occasions and a clear accumulation phase in the 2021 bull run. Meanwhile, in the 2017 bull run, the Bitcoin price recorded numerous straight green candle occasions. This market cycle looks to be replicating the 2021 bull run pattern, as BTC recorded three straight monthly green candles between January and March earlier this year before it recorded an accumulation phase. Therefore, as TradingShot explained, this is likely a good buying opportunity since the Bitcoin price could record a third straight monthly green candle in November. Another reason why Bitcoin would likely experience a monthly green candle in November is because the flagship crypto has enjoyed monthly positive returns most of the time it closed October in the green. The Bitcoin price outlook for November also looks bullish because of the upcoming US elections. The aftermath of the elections is expected to bring certainty to the market, which could cause Bitcoin to rally. Economist Alex Krüger predicted that the BTC could rally quickly to $90,000 if Donald Trump wins. Meanwhile, he mentioned that there is a chance that the flagship crypto could drop to as low as $65,000. Price Needs To Stay Above $69,000 In The Meantime In an X post, popular analyst Justin Bennett mentioned that the drop in Bitcoin’s price below $70,000 isn’t a good look, but the Bulls’ last line of defense is $69,000. He remarked that the $65,000 lows are next if that price level fails to hold on the high time frames. Justin Bennett added that he doubts that the equal highs from March and October near $73,700 will go unchallenged. However, before that happens, he suggested that the Bitcoin price could retest the lows at around $65,000. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has also revealed that the Bitcoin price needs to hold above $69,000 to reach a new all-time high (ATH). He predicted that BTC could rally to $78,000 if the $69,000 level holds. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks $73,000, Yet Google Searches Stay Stagnant—Is Hype Fading?

With downward momentum building and sellers gaining strength, this support level has become a focal point for traders watching for signs of stability or further decline. As the market turns cautious, the strength of FLOKI’s support will be crucial in determining its next move and whether it can withstand the current downtrend. This analysis aims to assess the current technical indicators signaling bearish pressure for FLOKI and evaluate the potential resilience of the $0.000110 support level. By examining key indicators and market dynamics, this piece aims to provide insight into whether the meme coin can hold steady at this critical threshold or if further downside risks loom. Is FLOKI’s $0.000110 Support In Danger? On the 4-hour chart, FLOKI is exhibiting negative momentum, trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) as it trends downward toward the $0.000110 support level. A continued descent toward this support suggests that selling pressure is intensifying, and if the support fails to hold, FLOKI could experience more declines. Also, the 4-hour Composite Trend Oscillator for FLOKI indicates bearish movement, with the signal line crossing below the SMA line and dropping below the zero line. This shift suggests increasing selling pressure, favoring sellers and raising concerns about potential further declines in price. Related Reading: Floki Inu Warning: Analyst Says ‘Prepare For The Crash’ – Details On the daily chart, the meme coin displays significant downward momentum, highlighted by a series of bearish candlestick patterns that have emerged following a failed recovery attempt. The inability to sustain upward movement after the recovery attempt suggests a lack of buyer confidence and a prevailing bearish sentiment in the market. As FLOKI trends toward this support level, the pressure from sellers could intensify, raising concerns about the possibility of a breakdown. A thorough examination of the 1-day Composite Trend Oscillator reveals that the asset is positioned for possible extended losses. The signal line has crossed below the SMA line and is trending downward beneath the zero line, signaling a notable shift in momentum toward the negative. If this downward trend continues, FLOKI may face substantial challenges in regaining upward traction, leading to an extended period of diminished price movement and increased bearish sentiment in the market. Testing Times Ahead For FLOKI FLOKI is nearing a pivotal point as it approaches the $0.000110 support level. If the asset breaks this critical threshold, it could trigger an additional decline, potentially leading the price down to the $0.00005381 level and other subsequent support areas. Related Reading: Floki Bullish Breakout Ignites: Could A 96% Surge Be Next? Conversely, should the meme coin manage to hold the $0.000110 support level, it could establish a base for a possible rebound, paving the way for a price increase toward the $0.0002105 mark and other resistance levels.

35541361,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651260,1730570408,"Analyst Reveals Why Bitcoin Price Crashed From $73,000 To $69,000","November began with an unexpected downturn in the crypto market as Bitcoin, which had gone on a bull run in the last week of October, rapidly lost its momentum. The highly anticipated “Moonvember” kicked off with an unexpected crash, plummeting from $73,000 on October 31 to $69,000 on November 1 to essentially wipe out $296 million in liquidations, with the majority of them being long positions. Despite the bulls managing to steady a Bitcoin price support at $69,000, the rapid downturn stirred questions among many crypto traders. Related Reading: Ethereum Claims Address Dominance With 43% Lead—Will It Keep Rising? According to crypto expert Ash Crypto on social media platform X, this quick crash in the Bitcoin price can be attributed to four major factors. Key Reasons Behind Bitcoin’s Price Drop According to Ash Crypto, the recent Bitcoin price isn’t a straightforward result of crypto-specific events but rather a reflection of the broader economic landscape. As he noted, there are currently multiple reports suggesting that Iran may be planning a military action against Israel from Iraqi territory. The potential escalation of conflict in the region seemed to have created uncertainty among Bitcoin investors, and many might have opted to exit from the markets. “As we all know, war is bad for Bitcoin and crypto,” the analyst said. Aside from the brewing conflict, Ash Crypto also highlighted the recent earnings reports from tech giants as another factor in the Bitcoin price crash. Major tech companies like Microsoft and Meta recently posted earnings reports that, despite beating expectations, showed rising AI-related costs. This led to a downturn in many other tech stocks, which spilled over to other financial markets, including the crypto industry. Another factor Ash Crypto highlighted is the recent climb in US Treasury’s bond yields, specifically the 10-year note, which is now trading above 4.3%. Higher yields make government bonds a more attractive alternative, making investors less likely to invest in more volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. Lastly, the latest Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) reading increased slightly above 2.7%. Ash Crypto noted that this rise in core inflation could push the Federal Reserve toward a more hawkish stance. This could lead to the Fed adopting higher interest rates or delaying rate cuts. Both scenarios could dampen demand for Bitcoin, which thrives in low interest rates, as shown by the September 18 interest rate cut. Looking Ahead: What’s Next For Bitcoin? Like many other crypto analysts, Ash Crypto remains confident that Bitcoin’s latest dip is only temporary. He drew parallels to October’s initial market dip, while anticipating that November, or “Moonvember,” will follow a similar trajectory. Interestingly, the analyst believes Bitcoin still has the momentum and market interest needed to push past $80,000 before the end of November.

42373420,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllDVW7,1730565845,Ethereum Researchers Relinquish EigenLayer Roles Over Conflict of Interest Concerns,"Ethereum Foundation researchers Dankrad Feist and Justin Drake have resigned from their advisory roles at EigenLayer, months after a controversy erupted over potential conflicts of interest within the Ethereum community.  EigenLayer is one of the most prominent up-and-coming cryptocurrency projects, serving as a platform for crypto applications to “borrow” Ethereum’s security through a novel concept called “restaking.”  Drake and Feist are among the best-known researchers at the non-profit Ethereum Foundation, which is responsible for stewarding the development of Ethereum, the largest smart-contract blockchain and the second-largest overall behind Bitcoin.  In the spring, Drake and Feist publicly confirmed that they had each accepted advisory roles with EigenLayer. Each researcher was allotted a significant sum of EIGEN tokens in exchange for helping guide the upcoming project and its roadmap.  The controversy surrounding these payouts revealed deep divisions within the Ethereum community — and among some of its most prominent figures — regarding the industry’s still-developing norms concerning conflicts of interest.  On Saturday, both of the researchers disclosed that they had relinquished their advisory roles with EigenLayer.  “While I believe that the role was negotiated in good faith and with the aim of making sure that EigenLayer is well aligned with Ethereum,” Feist said in an X post, “I understand that the perception of this relationship has been different and that for many the conflict of interest this creates is difficult to reconcile with my role as an Ethereum researcher.”  ""I want to apologize to the Ethereum community and EF colleagues for the drama I caused,"" Drake said in his own X post announcing that he had stepped down from his EigenLayer advisorship in September. ""In hindsight it was a bad move for me to make.""  In a message to CoinDesk, Drake clarified that his advisorship was terminated before any of his EIGEN tokens had been vested.  The Ethereum Foundation regularly awards grants to projects building atop the Ethereum ecosystem and has a major stake in the network’s overall development.  Some community members feared that EigenLayer’s payouts to foundation researchers amounted to an attempt by the project to influence the broader Ethereum network’s development roadmap.  In addition to stepping down from his EigenLayer advisory role, Drake took the added step of committing not to make investments or take advisory roles in the future.  “Going forward I will turn down all advisorships, angel investments, and security councils,” Drake said on X. “This personal policy goes above and beyond the recent EF-wide conflict of interest policy, not because that was asked of me but because I want to signal commitment to neutrality.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/11/02/ethereum-researchers-relinquish-eigenlayer-roles-over-conflict-of-interest-concerns,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4646266b52373aa834be5db8913303f15560f51a-1600x901.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This level is pivotal for SOL, as losing it could trigger a deeper correction, putting the altcoin at risk of further downside. However, prominent analyst Carl Runefelt has shared technical analysis indicating that Solana may be primed for a brief correction before staging a rally to retest local highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Open Interest Reduced By $2.1 Billion In 24 Hours – Time For Spot To Push The Price? Runefelt’s analysis highlights signs of renewed strength for SOL, suggesting that the altcoin is preparing for a move that could challenge recent highs within the next few days. This bullish setup depends heavily on Solana maintaining support at $165, which could act as a launchpad for further upward momentum. As the crypto market closely watches Bitcoin’s bid for a new all-time high, Solana investors are bracing for potential volatility. In this uncertain landscape, Solana remains a focal point for investors who see an opportunity if support holds steady. Solana Holding Key Demand Level Solana (SOL) has emerged as one of the stronger-performing altcoins this cycle, drawing significant attention as it tests a key demand level that could drive it toward new highs. Prominent analyst and investor Carl Runefelt recently shared a technical analysis on X, indicating that SOL may briefly dip to around $160 before staging a push to retest its recent high at $180. According to Runefelt, this $160 level represents a critical support zone for Solana, as holding above it is essential to sustain the altcoin’s bullish momentum and confirm its ongoing uptrend. Runefelt’s analysis emphasizes the importance of this support level in fueling Solana’s potential for gains, suggesting that it could serve as a springboard for a substantial rally. If SOL successfully holds above $160, a surge to test local highs would not only reinforce confidence among investors but also set the stage for Solana to push into new territory if broader market conditions remain favorable. The coming week could prove pivotal for SOL as the market braces for heightened volatility with the US election on the horizon (Nov 5) and Bitcoin nearing its all-time high. Related Reading: Analyst Exposes Ethereum Ascending Support At $2,400 – Best Chance To Accumulate ETH? As investors monitor macro events and Bitcoin’s movements closely, Solana’s technical setup around $160 will be a focal point for those seeking to capitalize on the altcoin’s potential gains. If Solana maintains its bullish structure, it could play a key role in leading the altcoin market forward in this cycle. SOL Technical Levels To Watch Solana is trading at $166 after a slight rebound from the $163 level, maintaining a strong position above the critical $160 support zone. This level has proven to be a vital threshold for SOL, as a sustained hold here could set the stage for a rally toward higher resistance levels. If buyers successfully defend $160, it may serve as the foundation for a climb to $183 and potentially beyond, with higher supply zones likely to be tested. Related Reading: Bitcoin Consolidates Near ATH – Volume Suggests A Big Move Ahead Analysts are watching this level closely, as it could either reinforce SOL’s bullish structure or signal the need for further consolidation. A breakdown below $160, however, would likely lead to a deeper correction, prompting traders to recalibrate their expectations as Solana seeks lower support levels. The next few days will be crucial as the market evaluates SOL’s strength at $160 and prepares for potential moves to new highs.

35533224,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651216,1730559607,Bitcoin ETFs Crucial To Sustain Current Buying Pressure – Details,"The price of Bitcoin recorded significant leaps in the past month rising by 14.74% according to data from CoinMarketCap. During this price rally, the premier cryptocurrency came close to establishing a new market all-time high, reaching a local peak of $73,149 on October 29. Interestingly, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju has stated a certain condition needed to sustain this price gain. Related Reading: Tracking Bitcoin’s Profit Cycles: Could A New Market High Be Near? Low Stablecoin Exchange Reserve Provides Need For Bitcoin ETFs In a series of X posts on November 1, Ki Young Ju stated that stablecoins currently provide an insufficient amount of liquidity to sustain the present buying pressure on Bitcoin. This observation is particularly important as traders commonly rely on stablecoins to acquire volatile assets such as Bitcoin, due to their fixed dollar value. Therefore, a higher stablecoin exchange reserve translates into significant potential for an impending price gain via wide-scale purchase. However, According to Young Ju, crypto exchanges currently hold only 21% of the total stablecoin market i.e. $34 billion of $166 billion, as most of these tokens are currently being used for storage or remittances. This development represents a slow rise in the stablecoin exchange reserve of $30 billion recorded in September 2021 during the last bull run, despite a 33% growth in total stablecoin shares in the same period. Currently, the Bitcoin-to-stablecoin reserve ratio is 6.05, similar to the value seen at the last ATH. Therefore, in order to maintain BTC’s present upward trajectory, Ki Young Ju postulates that the Spot Bitcoin ETFs, alongside Coinbase USD reserves, have to provide much-needed market liquidity. Notably, the Spot Bitcoin ETFs can be said to be behind Bitcoin’s current rally considering their impressive inflows record of over $5 billion in the past three weeks. Of this figure, BlackRock’s IBIT has led the market recording investments of $4.44 billion in this timeframe. Ki Young Ju states that it is important the Bitcoin ETFs maintain this momentum as a breakdown in pace will reduce buying pressure, especially from brokerage firms such as Coinbase Prime, which may result in Bitcoin falling back into consolidation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Fifth Consecutive Rejection At $72,000, Is Another Correction Coming? Bitcoin Price Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $69,608 reflecting a 1.32% loss in the last 24 hours. However, the asset’s trading volume is up by 25.61% and is valued at $51.56 billion. For the premier cryptocurrency, a return to above $73,000 remains much on the card, especially with the potential of sustained ETF flows and the upcoming US elections. If pro-crypto Donald Trump secures a victory on the ballot, Bitcoin should definitely establish a new all-time high with expectations of reaching $90,000-$100,000 at the end of 2024.

35529628,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651220,1730554209,Bitcoin On-Chain Indicator Signals Panic Selling At Current Levels – Time To HODL?,"Bitcoin is showing resilience, holding firm above the $69,000 mark after a slight pullback from recent local highs at $73,600. Following weeks of bullish momentum and nearing its all-time high, BTC has settled just below the critical $73,794 resistance, a key level that, if surpassed, would push the cryptocurrency into price discovery mode. According to data from CryptoQuant, short-term holders are experiencing a net profit-to-loss of negative 20 BTC, indicating a wave of panic selling among retail investors. This type of behavior, often driven by fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD), can precede a significant price surge as stronger hands accumulate BTC at lower prices. Related Reading: Analyst Exposes Ethereum Ascending Support At $2,400 – Best Chance To Accumulate ETH? Historically, similar sell-offs by retail investors have been followed by renewed upward momentum as longer-term holders seize the opportunity to enter or reinforce their positions. If Bitcoin can maintain support above $69,000, the odds of a breakout past its all-time high increase substantially. Market watchers are now closely monitoring the resistance level, as surpassing it could trigger a wave of buying interest and push BTC into new highs. The coming days may prove crucial, setting the stage for Bitcoin’s next big move. Bitcoin Weak Hands Selling Bitcoin recently attempted a breakthrough to new heights but failed to breach its all-time high of $73,794, entering a consolidation phase as the market eyes key events: next week’s U.S. election and the Federal Reserve’s anticipated interest rate decision. CryptoQuant’s recent data, shared by analyst Axel Adler on X, points to a noteworthy trend among short-term BTC holders. The net profit-to-loss ratio for these holders shows a negative balance of -20 BTC, indicating a wave of panic selling following Bitcoin’s struggle to establish new highs. This sell-off among short-term investors, who tend to react more quickly to market volatility, suggests some caution amid uncertainty. Adler emphasizes that in such turbulent times, a long-term “HODL” (hold on for dear life) approach can be the most beneficial strategy. Holding strong through market noise has historically rewarded BTC investors who keep their positions intact during periods of retracement and heightened volatility. With Bitcoin’s all-time high in sight, a successful breakout would likely signal the beginning of a broad market bull run. The coming days are critical as Bitcoin sits at a pivotal point in its cycle, balancing between strong consolidation and the possibility of explosive growth. Related Reading: Bitcoin Open Interest Reduced By $2.1 Billion In 24 Hours – Time For Spot To Push The Price? The influence of the Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rates, paired with potential election outcomes, could create the market conditions needed for BTC to push past its all-time high. If this level is breached, it would not only affirm a bullish outlook for BTC but likely set off a rally across the entire cryptocurrency market. BTC Holding Above Key Support Bitcoin is currently trading at $69,620 following a retrace from its recent high near $73,600. Despite this pullback, bulls remain in control as BTC holds firmly above the crucial $69,000 support level—a price point that acted as resistance since late July. This level has now transformed into strong support, bolstering bullish sentiment in the market. If Bitcoin holds above $69,000, a renewed push above all-time highs seems likely. Breaking this resistance would propel BTC into uncharted territory, potentially sparking a fresh wave of bullish momentum and price discovery. However, if the price dips below this mark, it could signal a need for a more significant correction to gather enough buying power for the next move up. Related Reading: Dogwifhat (WIF) Prepares For A Bullish Breakout – Analyst Sets $3 Target The $69,000 level serves as a key indicator of market confidence, as losing it would imply that BTC might temporarily seek lower support levels to attract new buyers and stabilize before another attempt at new highs. For now, Bitcoin’s price structure remains strong, and as long as this support holds, the market anticipates further upside momentum in the coming days. Bulls are closely watching this level, as it may define the next phase of Bitcoin’s bull run.

As the prominent altcoin now hovers around the $2,500 price mark, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has highlighted an important market condition that could ignite a price rebound. Related Reading: Ethereum Blobs Are ‘Insanely Bullish” For ETH Price: Breakthrough Research Ethereum Buy Signal Subject To Vital Price Support In an X post on November 1, Martinez stated that TD Sequential has indicated a buy signal on the ETH 4-hour chart. For context, the TD Sequential commonly used trading indicator to signal potential turning points in price trends and provide signals for trend exhaustion or potential price reversals. Following Ethereum’s decline over the past 48 hours, TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal, indicating a possible price recovery on the horizon. However, Martinez states that for this bullish signal to prove true, Ethereum must remain above the $2,480 support zone. A potential price drop below this support level would result in a further decline to $2,200, indicating a potential 12% decrease from the token’s current price. However, Ethereum is expected to rebound to around $2,700 if the specified support zone holds. Interestingly, fellow market analyst Michaël van de Poppe has provided some valuable insights into Ethereum’s price if this successful price recovery occurs. In a post on X, van de Poppe applauds the resilience of Ethereum despite the rise in US permanent job losses as revealed by the recent unemployment data by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. He also notes ETH has been a range-bound market oscillating between $2,200-$2,700 since August. However, van de Poppe states that if Ethereum returns above $2,700 in the next two weeks, the altcoin may surge to around $3,200 in the next few weeks, finally breaking out of consolidation. In addition, the crypto analyst continues to reiterate his projections of Ethereum to outperform Bitcoin in the coming months as the latter approaches its peak dominance level. Ethereum is expected to lead the “altcoin season” with predictions of hitting a five-digit value next few months.

The network itself is showing promising signs with growth in fees, daily active addresses, and stablecoin transfer volume. Based on spot ETF holdings data, it appears as though the net outflow from US spot products is slowing down. In my last coverage of Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) for Seeking Alpha at the beginning of October, I shared a somewhat cautious outlook on the native asset of the network due to what I viewed as a weakening bull case for the coin itself. I left readers with this takeaway: Active bid for gas payment has dwindled with the success of L2 scaling. And the capital investment story simply hasn't held up to expectations. For all the reasons listed, ETH might be a half decent contrarian bet at this point as sentiment is poor. Since then, ETH hasn't really gone much of anywhere. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) put up a 10% October while ETH was essentially flat: Data by YCharts This under-performance relative to Bitcoin in October continued a multi-year decline in the ETH/BTC ratio that has worsened seemingly in a straight line since September 2022: ETH/BTC Monthly (TrendSpider) Despite the woeful performance of ETH the asset, there have been some positive signs in the Ethereum ecosystem. In this update, we'll look at Ethereum network data in the month of October, trends in the broader ETH ecosystem, capital flows, and the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF ( ETHE ). Network Data The two primary ways that I like to examine public Blockchain networks are through daily active addresses and network fees. For the remainder of this article, I'll be shortening 'daily active addresses' to 'DAAs.' As I've pointed out before and will point out again, DAAs are not the same thing as DAUs or unique users for traditional platforms. But for the purpose of judging permission-less public chain data, it's the best we have. Given that, the long term trend in DAAs on Ethereum's main layer is flat to down. However, since the Ethereum ecosystem has shifted to an L2-based growth strategy, its more prudent to look at combined DAAs with the major L2s in addition to base layer addresses: Ethereum Ecosystem DAAs October 2024 (Artemis) Through this lens, we can see that October was yet another month of growth. October 2024 generated 3.2 million DAAs spread out among Ethereum and the larger L2 networks - that was up 7% month over month and 190% over October 2023. The biggest driver of this address growth has primarily been Base ( COIN ) which accounted for 1.4 million of the 3.2 million DAAs in October. From a fee standpoint, nearly 96% of the total fees generated from the chains shown in the chart above came from Ethereum. Monthly Fees vs P/F Ratio (Token Terminal) That figure came out to be $142.3 million in fees during the month of October. This was up 37% from $103.7 million in September and 56% from the $91.2 million in fees during October 2023. Given that the price of ETH ended October flat from a capital appreciation standpoint, the higher fees did bring down the network's fully diluted price to fees multiple to the lowest level in 6 months. Last year's average fully diluted P/F ratio for October was 210x fees. This year the average P/F ratio was 181x fees in October 2024. 30 Day Fees, L1 Breakout (Token Terminal) Comparing Ethereum to other L1 networks, shows a network that is still ahead of insurgent smart contract chains like Solana ( SOL-USD ) or Toncoin (TON-USD) but one that remains behind the industry leader Tron ( TRX-USD ). All told, I think there are positive signs from Ethereum's ecosystem usage for the month of October. Beyond fees and DAAs, there was year over year growth in several additional metrics that I think are important for network health: ETH Ecosystem 2023 2024 YoY Transactions (millions) $124.6 $386.8 210.4% Stablecoin Supply (billions) $67.1 $90.1 34.3% Stablecoin Transfer Volume (billions) $361.2 $1,025.2 183.8% Source: Artemis (combined between Arbitrum, Base, Blast, Celo, Ethereum, Optimism, Polygon zkEVM, Skroll, Starknet, zkSync Era, Zora) I'm particularly encouraged by the growth in stablecoins and stablecoin transfer volume. Though I will note that we again see some of the fastest ecosystem growth happening on Base rather than mainnet or other L2s. The problem with scaling via L2s is the activity isn't necessarily adding value to ETH as an asset because less ETH is required to transfer on secondary chains rather than the primary layer. In my view, this has diminished the investment case for ETH and it's difficult to argue with what we're seeing from capital markets. Capital Flow Data The spot ETH ETFs in the United States continue to be a massive dud and I'll show that in a moment. But first, the global investment product capital flow story for Ethereum remains lackluster for 2024: $ in Millions Week flows MTD Flows YTD Flows AUM Bitcoin $920 $3,278 $25,464 $78,990 Ethereum -$35 -$12 $748 $10,114 Multi-asset $2 $28 $470 $5,506 Solana $11 $18 $69 $1,475 Binance - -$2 -$2 $588 Source: CoinShares, as of October 25th In the company's most recent report from October 28th, we see month to date outflow from Ethereum products in the face of $3.3 billion of positive flow into Bitcoin-related products and other assets. The year to date flow into ETH products is just $748 million. Certainly weighing on global investment demand is the the US market via spot ETFs: ETH ETF Daily Flow (Farside) Here we can see the total net flow for Ethereum ETFs continues to be a problem at negative $468 million and it's entirely due to ""fee flight"" out of Grayscale's ETHE fund. The table above shows over $3.1 billion in asset value has left ETHE since conversion from a closed fund to ETF. Adjusting the outflow to ETH rather than dollars really tells the tale though: Spot ETF Daily AUM (TheBlock) The chart above shows 2.93 million ETH tokens held via ETHE when spot products were approved in the United States. That holding total is now down to 1.59 million ETH held through ETHE. Without strong demand for Ethereum through other ETFs, the net impact is negative and that further depresses the price of ETH. This is generally not new. However, I do want to point out that the total ETH held through these products was 2.74 million at the end of the September and 2.74 million at the end of October as well. So even as investors continue to leave ETHE due to the 2.5% management fee, October's net flow story measured in ETH was flat. Coupled with the promising signs from fees on-chain and usage growth, it's possible the worst is over for ETH. But that's purely speculative on my part and should be taken with a grain of salt. Risks Monthly fees ETH vs SOL (Artemis) When it comes to monthly fees, Ethereum is indeed ahead of Solana but the lead is actually shrinking. At $73.9 million in monthly fees, Solana put in its strongest month ever based on that metric. It's quite clear that Ethereum's L2 chains still suffer from fragmentation and the broader ecosystem is battling numerous other L1 chains that offer cheap base layer fees and better transaction throughput. What remains to be seen is the degree to which ""switching costs"" will diminish the TAM of those competing L1 networks. But just because Ethereum has been a dominant L1 network historically, it does mean that ETH will command the second largest market capitalization forever. Summary I'm still of the view that Ethereum shouldn't be kicked to the curb by digital asset investors. There are certainly still headwinds including increasing competition from other blockchain ecosystems. But I suspect the cheaper, high throughput chains are better suited for the memecoins and high frequency trading. Ethereum maintains 48% of the entire crypto stablecoin market. If one believes stables are the ""killer app"" of public blockchains, then Ethereum still deserves a place in portfolios given its commanding head start in the segment. There are positive signs from both network usage and network valuation standpoints. ETHE fee flight remains a headwind as well. But it's clear the net outflow trend from ETH ETFs has been slowing down. October was a good month for Ethereum and nobody noticed. I wouldn't personally express a 'long ETH' thesis through ETHE, but Ethereum is a 'buy' in my eyes.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH | SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4732381-ethe-ethereum-quietly-positive-october-ethusd-cyrpto?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/35526839.jpeg

35525448,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651207,1730543442,BNB Token Burn: $1 Billion Of Tokens Sent To ‘Black Hole’ Address — Impact On Price?,"On Friday, November 1, the BNB Foundation announced the successful completion of the 29th quarterly burn by the BNB Chain. This latest event of the routine token burn reiterates the project’s commitment to a deflationary approach in order to ensure growth. A total of 1,772,712.363 BNB tokens (worth approximately $1.07 billion) were automatically burned in this quarter’s event. According to the foundation’s blog post, this quarter’s burning was (and subsequent token burning events will be) performed directly on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), with the burn amount sent to a “black hole” address. Can The Latest Burn Event Propel BNB’s Price To $600? Token burning, a process in which tokens or coins are purposely and permanently removed from circulation, is carried out to trigger an increase in a token’s value. Similarly, the quarterly token burn can have a significant impact on BNB’s price by decreasing the total supply, thereby creating a deflationary effect. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bollinger Bands Squeezes Tighter Than It Was Before 2021 Rally, What This Means Moreover, the consistency of the quarterly BNB burns shows the dedication of the foundation to the long-term growth and success of the token. This positive trend could favorably impact general market sentiment, as it strengthens investors’ trust in BNB’s potential as a stable investment. However, it is worth looking at the impact of previous quarterly burns on the BNB price to be able to gauge the potential effect of the latest event. Notably, the 28th token burn, which was completed on July 22, 2024, didn’t exactly have a bullish impact on the value of the fourth-largest cryptocurrency. According to data from CoinGecko, the price of the BNB token sat just above $600 as of July 22. Unexpectedly, the token’s price fell more than 22% to a low of $464 about two weeks after the burn event. BNB’s value seemed to have crumbled under the bearish climate of the general market. The BNB token has mostly been in a consolidation range over the past few months, mirroring the state of Bitcoin and the general crypto market. Fortunately, the premier cryptocurrency seems to be back in the bullish zone after returning to $70,000 for the first time since June. If the strong positive correlation between BNB and Bitcoin plays out, it means that investors could see Binance’s native token resume its upward trend. Hence, BNB seems to have a positive outlook and could soon reclaim $600, especially if the flagship cryptocurrency remains bullish. BNB Price At A Glance As of this writing, the value of BNB stands around $571.8, reflecting a 0.6% price dip in the past 24 hours.

Analyst Says Price Surge is Overdue,"Pseudonymous crypto analyst Madmaudo has insisted that a Cardano surge to levels around its all-time high is overdue, asserting an imminent uptick. Cardano’s price has been in a range in the past month despite bullish rallies from other notable crypto assets. Market data shows the 11th cryptocurrency market cap has ranged between $0.3346 and $0.369 since the start of October.Amid these price movements, ADA’s chart shows it has been on a descending triangle since its yearly high of $0.7741 in March. The chart indicates the formation of lower highs and lower lows, with the price action getting tighter towards the end of the triangle.According to pseudonymous analyst Madmaudo, a breakout and surge near Cardano’s all-time high seen in September 2021 is long overdue. The market speculator asserted that he sees the long pent-up price action soon.Madmaudo Calls Cardano to $3 OverdueIn a TradingView analysis on November 2, Madmaudo stated that a surge to $3 is long overdue for Cardano. He then asserted that ADA would surge 88% to close down on its all-time high of around $3.1. His chart indicates he expects ADA to break out of a multi-year descending triangle to the $3 target.Furthermore, using the Fibonacci retracement indicator, the market speculator added crucial levels to watch on ADA’s path to $3. First, the indicator shows a surge to $1.2253 at the 38.3% Fibonacci level, then an uptick to $1.5808 at the 50% Fibonacci level.The analyst expects the next stop to be $1.9362 at the 61.8% Fibonacci level before hitting $3.0869 at the 100% Fibonacci level. Notably, Madmaudo’s target is inches away from ADA’s current ATH.Analyst Commends Recent Partnership with BitcoinMadmaudo cited the recent partnership between the Cardano and Bitcoin ecosystems as a FOMO catalyst for the ADA price. The analyst argued it was a “great partnership with Bitcoin.”For context, one of Cardano’s major developers, EMURGO, partnered with BitcoinOS to unleash smart contract features on the Bitcoin network. Cardano will operate as a layer on the Bitcoin blockchain, introducing decentralized finance while accessing over $1.3 trillion worth of liquidity.Market speculators have teased the partnership to boost the Cardano ecosystem, and Madmaudo shares the same sentiment. He expects the bullish scenario to bolster a surge to $3.At the time of writing, ADA trades at $0.3578, up 3.18% in the past 24 hours.",POSITIVE,ADA,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/02/cardano-to-3-analyst-says-price-surge-is-overdue/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=cardano-to-3-analyst-says-price-surge-is-overdue,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

35529688,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=100237,1730540971,Expert Shares Realistic XRP Price Target for Coming Bull Run,"Expert trader Altcoin Moe shares his realistic price targets for XRP and other cryptocurrencies amid recent market movements, suggesting XRP could rally by 870%. This week, the cryptocurrency market experienced remarkable price movements, particularly with Bitcoin making significant gains. In contrast, altcoins like XRP remained largely stagnant. XRP traded within a narrow range of $0.51 to $0.53, while Bitcoin surged to $73,500.The lack of upward momentum for XRP during this bullish period caught the attention of both investors and market analysts. XRP supporters remain optimistic that XRP will eventually embark on its own upward trajectory.Amid this trend, Altcoin Moe, a widely followed full-time trader, took to X to share what he considers realistic price projections for prominent crypto assets, including Bitcoin and XRP.“Realistic” Target for BitcoinAt the top of Moe’s list was Bitcoin, which he expects to reach a target of $115,000 ""realistically"" at the peak of the bull run. Two weeks ago, a notable financial platform argued that Bitcoin would peak at least at $130,000 this season.Meanwhile, other market watchers have suggested much higher levels, with targets ranging from $200,000 to even $500,000. For instance, Bernstein analysts believe $200,000 is a more conservative target for BTC, while Moe thinks these lofty targets may not be realistic.Notably, Bitcoin attempted to retest its all-time high this week when it surged to $73,600 on Tuesday but ultimately failed to surpass this level to create a new peak.As for Bitcoin’s closest rival, Ethereum, Moe suggested it could reach $8,000 in this bull run. At press time, Ethereum is valued at $2,500, meaning an increase to $8,000 would represent a massive 220% growth, which Moe considers realistic. This contrasts with the 65% gains he projected for Bitcoin.Plausible Target for XRPFor XRP, the seventh-largest cryptocurrency, Moe suggested a $5 price is realistic.

35529687,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=100234,1730540590,Will Shiba Inu Price Reach $0.01 or $0.001 with a $10T Market Cap,"Shiba Inu price could reach substantial heights if it ever clinches a market cap in the trillion-dollar range. The crypto market presents ample opportunity for investors to secure considerable gains on their investments. While Bitcoin (BTC) pioneered the experience, altcoins like Shiba Inu have made massive contributions.Shiba Inu Boasts Historic RunFor instance, a previous report from CoinGecko confirmed that SHIB turned a $13 investment to $1 million within 453 days during the 2020/2021 bull market, making it one of the most successful crypto assets and the most successful among the top 100 during that period. This historic run has influenced several bullish projections for Shiba Inu, with analysts expecting the crypto asset to witness a similar price explosion during the ongoing bull run. Notably, SHIB has already demonstrated its potential in the first phase of the ongoing bull market, having surged nearly 400% from late February to early March.Some individuals are optimistic that the second-largest meme coin would not miss out on this bull run. However, the extent of its rally remains uncertain. While the $0.00008 target has featured prominently among analysts, others believe SHIB could clinch a new high above $0.0001 .Meanwhile, the $0.001 and $0.01 targets have also made their way into these discussions. For instance, last month, analyst Crypto Sheriff predicted a long-term Shiba Inu target of $0.001 following a breakout. Market analytics resource CoinCodex also recently discussed how SHIB could reach $0.01.Can SHIB Hit $0.001 and $0.01 at $10T Market CapHowever, despite the prevalence of these audacious targets, most investors remain skeptical. Altcoin Daily’s Aaron Arnold argued last month that it is impossible for Shiba Inu to reach $0.01. This skepticism is due to SHIB’s extensive circulating supply, which would lead to unimaginable market caps at such high prices.Nonetheless, some argue that Shiba Inu has the capability of hitting greater market caps in the future as more capital flows into the market, eventually surpassing the previous peak of $40 billion attained in late 2021.Amid these projections, we recently assessed if SHIB could reach the $0.01 and $0.001 targets should its market cap hit an audacious $10 trillion. Notably, at a $10 trillion market valuation, Shiba Inu would boast a price of $0.0169, given its current circulating supply of 589 trillion tokens.This price essentially puts Shiba Inu above the $0.01 price and the $0.001 level. However, while this presents a hypothetical scenario in which SHIB might claim these targets, the $10 trillion market valuation is highly improbable for SHIB, especially in the current market landscape.",NEUTRAL,BTC | SHIB,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/02/will-shiba-inu-price-reach-0-01-or-0-001-with-a-10t-market-cap/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=will-shiba-inu-price-reach-0-01-or-0-001-with-a-10t-market-cap,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Currently, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.00001775, up 5% over the past week. At the start of the week, it was at $0.000016 but quickly rebounded to near $0.00002. After a brief pullback, SHIB dipped just above $0.00001700 but is rapidly recouping lost ground.Amid this performance, InvestingHaven took to X to highlight Shiba Inu’s resilience, revising its projection for the asset upwards.Now “Ultra-Bullish” on SHIBInitially, the platform predicted that SHIB would dip to $0.0000144 in October. However, the lowest point SHIB reached that month was $0.00001553, occurring early on the 3rd. InvestingHaven acknowledged the efforts of Shiba Inu bulls in preventing further declines.The platform had suggested that if SHIB could maintain a closing price above $0.0000144 in October, it would solidify its position for a potential rally in 2025. Notably, Shiba Inu ended October at $0.00001973, representing a 27% gain from the month’s low.This unexpected buying interest is now viewed as a strong bullish indicator, prompting InvestingHaven to revise its stance on SHIB to “ultra-bullish” for 2025.Shiba Inu Primed for a “Strong” 2025Specifically, InvestingHaven asserts that Shiba Inu is set for a robust rally into 2025. The platform’s projections for SHIB in 2025 anticipate high volatility and substantial price swings, with a trading range expected between a low of $0.0000144 and a high of $0.0000495.This wide range suggests potential opportunities for both short-term traders and long-term investors, as the platform notes that market participants will have multiple favorable entry points for SHIB in 2025.Notably, the upper target of $0.0000495 represents a substantial 179% gain from Shiba Inu’s current market value. It’s worth mentioning that Shiba Inu last reached $0.0000495 in 2021. The asset approached this level in March when it rallied to $0.000045 but has since lost most of those gains. Market participants hope that reattaining this level will pave the way for further price surges.Meanwhile, InvestingHaven’s suggestion that SHIB could trade at $0.0000144 in 2025 implies that current investors might experience a short-term loss of 20% before a potential 178% price surge.

These prior distributions were typically facilitated through major crypto exchange platforms such as Bitstamp and Kraken. Currently, Mt. Gox retains a substantial holding of 44,905 BTC, valued at more than $3 billion. This recent transfer follows an October announcement by Mt.

35529681,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=100218,1730535060,"XRP Sees Longest Bollinger Bands Squeeze in History, Hinting at Possible Price Explosion","XRP may be laying the groundwork for a massive price explosion due to a historical squeeze in its Bollinger Bands. This indicator, which measures price volatility, has shown major patterns in the past that have often led to notable price explosions. Interestingly, the current data suggests that XRP might be on the verge of another big movement.XRP Historical Bollinger Band SqueezeFor context, in 2016, XRP began a period of Bollinger Bands compression that lasted from August 2016 to February 2017. During this time, XRP was in a consolidation phase, holding within a relatively stable range. Once this squeeze period concluded, XRP’s price skyrocketed, marking one of the most impressive price surges in its history. In the months following the squeeze, XRP’s value rose dramatically from $0.00555 to an all-time high of $3.31 by January 2018. This marked an increase of nearly 60,000% within a year. After this massive price rise, XRP began to retrace, and by May 2020, another Bollinger Bands squeeze was underway. This squeeze persisted until October 2020, when XRP saw renewed upward momentum . XRP 1M Chart XRP 1M Chart However, XRP’s price rally faced a major challenge when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Ripple in December 2020. This lawsuit led to a sudden drop in XRP’s price, with a 66.97% decline in December following a 177.23% rally in November. Despite the setback, XRP’s price did not remain stagnant for long. Following the lawsuit’s initial impact, XRP resumed its bullish trajectory and reached a cycle peak of $1.96 in April 2021. This represented a 717% gain from its low point, achieved despite the legal issues. XRP Now Facing Another SqueezeMany analysts believe that XRP’s price could have climbed even higher and potentially exceeded its January 2018 all-time high of $3.31 if not for the legal challenges stemming from the SEC case.Now, XRP’s Bollinger Bands are experiencing another squeeze, which began in December 2023 and has continued for nearly a year . This is currently the longest squeeze in XRP’s history, and long squeezes often signal more dramatic price movements. However, whether this breakout will lead to a significant rally or a sharp decline remains uncertain. The extended squeeze has captured the attention of market analysts and XRP investors, who are closely watching for any signs of a breakout.Another indicator that could help predict XRP’s upcoming movement is the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the monthly chart. Historically, the RSI has also shown patterns preceding XRP breakouts . During previous Bollinger Bands squeezes, XRP’s monthly RSI typically ranged between 48 and 51. Right before a breakout, however, the RSI would drop close to 47. This pattern occurred in February 2017, just before XRP’s price surged, with an RSI level of 47.18. It happened again in October 2020 when the RSI dropped to 47.51, just as XRP began its upward trend.At present, XRP’s RSI is hovering around 48.41, with the price trading for $0.5122. A dip toward the 47 level could serve as a signal that XRP is on the brink of a breakout. However, if the pattern holds, XRP’s price may face a brief decline before this anticipated upward move takes place.",POSITIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/02/xrp-sees-longest-bollinger-bands-in-history-hinting-at-possible-price-explosion/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=xrp-sees-longest-bollinger-bands-in-history-hinting-at-possible-price-explosion,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Total Tether Assets Reach All-Time High Conducted by accounting firm BDO, the report highlights Tether’s growth, with a net profit of $2.5 billion for Q3, contributing to a consolidated profit of $7.7 billion for the first nine months of 2024. This marks a significant achievement for the company, with total assets reaching an all-time high of $134.4 billion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Slides Below $70,000: These Are The Key Reasons Another notable accomplishment in the report was the expansion of Tether’s stablecoin supply, which now exceeds $120 billion in circulation. This represents a 30% increase since the beginning of the year and reflects the growing global demand for Tether’s stablecoin, USDT. Tether’s reserves are now at over $105 billion in cash and cash equivalents, including $102.5 billion in direct and indirect exposures to US Treasury bills (T-Bills). If categorized as a country, the stablecoin company would rank among the top 18 holders of US Treasuries globally, surpassing nations like Germany and Australia. CEO Ardoino Criticizes ‘Inclusion Washing’ By Other Firms CEO Paolo Ardoino emphasized the company’s dedication to transparency and responsible risk management, stating “Tether’s performance in Q3 showcases our relentless commitment to liquidity and financial stability,” pointing to the increase in the reserve buffer to over $6 billion and investments made through Tether Investments. The Tether CEO revealed that these investments span various sectors, including renewable energy, Bitcoin mining, artificial intelligence (AI), telecommunications, and education. In a recent social media post on X (formerly Twitter), Ardoino also highlighted the importance of USDT in promoting financial inclusion, particularly in developing countries. He noted that a significant portion of USDT’s usage is concentrated in regions with limited traditional banking services. “USDt is the digital dollar for hundreds of millions of people who the banking industry has left behind,” Ardoino explained, underscoring the stablecoin’s role in providing financial access to “underserved populations.” Related Reading: BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Reaches 2% Of Total BTC Supply Amid Record Inflows Despite progress, Ardoino acknowledged that a substantial portion of the global population—approximately 3 billion people—still lacks access to basic financial services. Ardoino further criticized the notion of “financial inclusion washing,” where companies make grand claims about enhancing financial access without delivering tangible results. In contrast, the CEO said Tether aims to lead the charge toward “a more inclusive financial ecosystem.” At the time of writing, the market’s largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was trading at $69,390, having lost its consolidation above the key $70,000 resistance level while recording a 1.2% drop in price over the past 24 hours.

He promised to engage in private and public discussions regarding the TREAT token. This move ensures that all key opinion leaders (KOLs) within the Shiba Inu ecosystem are fully briefed about the upcoming token. Furthermore, he revealed that the team is close to launching the Karma and Reputation system tied to the DAO governance. Kusama suggested that he hopes the system provides a transparent record of users’ reputations, emphasizing that it would expose bad actors and reward good behavior within the community. This initiative also aims to make the Shiba Inu ecosystem a trustworthy hub for developers by boosting its credibility. Unending Warnings Meanwhile, scammers have been adopting different tactics to exploit unsuspecting members of the Shiba Inu community. They include promoting fake airdrops relating to Shiba Inu ecosystem tokens and creating counterfeit versions of existing and upcoming tokens. These malefactors promote these illicit activities by impersonating some prominent Shiba Inu ecosystem team members, like Kusama. The recent trend involves purchasing accounts Kusama follows on X to promote fake tokens. Interestingly, the Shiba Inu ecosystem team has continued to expose these scam tactics to keep users safe. The team has consistently warned that the TREAT token has not been launched into the market. Therefore, any TREAT token claiming affiliations with the Shiba Inu project is fake.",NEGATIVE,ETH | SHIB,ETH | MARKET | MINING | SHIB,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/02/shiba-inu-lead-exposes-how-scammers-exploit-his-engagement-with-shib-community/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=shiba-inu-lead-exposes-how-scammers-exploit-his-engagement-with-shib-community,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

35529677,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=100210,1730531405,Here is How Much XRP Ripple Holds According to Its Latest Market Report,"Ripple has released a fresh quarterly report focusing on the XRP market, disclosing details of the company’s total XRP holdings. Notably, Ripple shares its quarterly XRP markets report to provide a transparent and informed perspective on key updates on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and XRP-related developments. Among the key highlights in the latest report are specific records concerning how much XRP Ripple holds.How Much XRP Does Ripple Hold?Ripple discloses its XRP holdings at the start and end of each quarter. The company's XRP reserves are divided into two categories: Available XRP: This refers to the XRP that Ripple currently holds in its wallets and has immediate access to. Escrowed XRP : This category includes XRP locked in on-ledger escrow accounts, which are scheduled to be released monthly. Until the escrow is released, Ripple does not have access to this XRP. Each month, a portion of the escrowed XRP—specifically 1 billion tokens—is released to Ripple. The company typically withdraws 200 million XRP tokens from this release and re-escrows the remaining balance.As of June 30, 2024, Ripple reported holding a total of 4,682,112,997 (4.68 billion) XRP. Additionally, the company had 39,500,000,005 XRP locked in escrow at that time. By September 30, 2024, Ripple’s holdings had decreased to 4,436,713,796 (4.44 billion) XRP, while the amount subject to on-ledger escrow was slightly lower at 38,900,000,005 (38.9 billion) XRP.In other words, at the start of the fourth quarter of 2024, Ripple had a total balance of 43.33 billion XRP.Meanwhile, Ripple released 1 billion XRP in October and locked back 800 million. In November, 1 billion XRP was released , but as of press time, the company had yet to re-lock 800 million tokens from the November escrow execution.Ripple’s XRP Balance Per API DataAccording to Ripple’s API data , with the most recent entry dated October 27, Ripple’s spendable balance stood at approximately 4.42 billion XRP. Meanwhile, the escrowed balance was 38.7 billion. With the 1 billion tokens released on November 1, this escrow balance would have decreased to 37.7 billion and would eventually increase to 38.5 billion XRP should Ripple return the customary 800 million tokens.Ripple Sends XRP to ETPs and TrustsFurthermore, Ripple disclosed that it occasionally transfers XRP to third parties, including trusts, exchange-traded products (ETPs), and other investment entities.When this occurs, a smaller quantity of XRP may be returned to escrow for that month. However, Ripple noted that as long as it anticipates the transferred XRP will remain within its holdings and not enter the wider market, it is classified as “XRP Held by Ripple.”",NEUTRAL,XRP,MARKET | WALLET | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/02/here-is-how-much-xrp-ripple-holds-according-to-its-latest-market-report/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=here-is-how-much-xrp-ripple-holds-according-to-its-latest-market-report,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Some market watchers suggested the cryptocurrency will pull some “big moves” toward a new all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Fifth Consecutive Rejection At $72,000, Is Another Correction Coming? SUI Recovers From Halloween’s Correction As October ended, the crypto market saw a spooky correction led by Bitcoin’s drop below the $70,000 mark. Most cryptocurrencies experienced a significant retrace, with Ethereum and Solana bleeding around 5%. SUI, the native token of the Sui Network, joined the rest of the market and declined by 4%, losing its recently recovered $2 support. The cryptocurrency has been one of the best-performing tokens in the past few months, outperforming most of the market during Q3. Moreover, it recorded a 25% rise toward its latest $2.35 ATH two weeks ago. Following its rally to its ATH, SUI’s price faced an 18.5% correction, making investors and analysts forecast a longer consolidation time for the token. Earlier this week, the token followed BTC’s surge and eyed the $2.15 zone, which previously propelled the price toward its latest ATH. Nonetheless, the token reached the lower levels of the $1.90 support zone on Friday morning amid the market retrace. Today, SUI surged 9.3% from its $1.92 daily low to hit the $2.10 mark before retracing to $2.07. Some analysts consider the cryptocurrency is gearing up to “put in a big move” following the correction. Is A Retest Of The $2.35 ATH Looming? Analyst AMCrypto pointed out that SUI’s recent performance could target a breakout from a bull flag formation. Per the chart, the cryptocurrency displays this bullish pattern in the three-day chart, with the breakout target sitting at $2.05. The analyst stated that if SUI successfully breaks above the upper trendline, “it’ll pump towards its previous ATH.” Meanwhile, crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa proposed two short-term outcomes for the token. Sherpa considers the cryptocurrency will test the ATH zone and pull back to the current levels at least once more in the coming weeks. He indicated the price could drop to $1.65 if it fails to hold the $2 support. However, it could also bounce from this level after the retrace and rally toward a new ATH of around $2.7 by year-end. Sherpa previously suggested that tokens with a strong September performance still have “a bit more pullback to go” with “plenty of bounces” before resuming their run. Related Reading: Analyst Says It’s ‘Time To Be Bullish On Ethereum’ As ETH Retests $2,700 Most of the market will experience volatility in the coming days as speculation and anticipation build up for the outcome of the US presidential elections, scheduled for next week. Analyst Michaël van de Poppe noted that most altcoins, including SUI, were in a correction period and explained how its retest of the $1.90-$2 support is “crucial for further upward momentum.” As of this writing, SUI is trading at $2.05, a 3.5% increase in the last 24 hours.

35507771,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651149,1730520016,Bitcoin Price Correction Triggers $296 Million In Liquidations – Can BTC Still Hit ATH?,"Bitcoin (BTC) has had a volatile 24 hours, hitting as low as $68,830 on the Binance crypto exchange before recovering some losses. Liquidation Data At A Glance Although BTC is trading close to its all-time high (ATH) value of $73,737, yesterday’s quick drop in price cast doubts on whether the top digital asset will be able to record a new ATH. Related Reading: Bitcoin Makes ATH Against Euro Due To Change In Dollar Strength, Details Inside According to CoinGlass data from the crypto liquidations tracker, more than $296 million of active positions were liquidated in the last 24 hours. Nearly 77% were long positions, indicating that traders were largely betting on BTC’s continued upward momentum. Binance saw the most liquidations at $124 million, followed by OKX with $74 million and Bybit with $65 million. In digital assets, Bitcoin led with over $97 million worth of positions liquidated, followed by Ethereum (ETH) at $47 million, and Solana at nearly $17 million. With yesterday’s slump, the total crypto market cap has shrunk by about 3.5%, currently valued at $2.48 trillion. It is worth noting that although BTC is close to its ATH, the total crypto market cap is still considerably far from its ATH of $2.98 trillion recorded in November 2021. The gap between BTC’s performance and the overall market cap suggests that altcoins have not kept pace with BTC’s recent gains, contributing to the disparity. This could also indicate a cautious investor sentiment, favoring BTC over altcoins during uncertain periods. At the same time, it suggests that there is still a lot of room for altcoins to grow, which could tempt some more risk-seeking investors to accumulate altcoins in hopes of extraordinary gains relative to BTC. That said, Bitcoin dominance – a metric that gauges the proportion of the overall crypto market cap commanded by BTC – is steadily climbing toward 60%. A higher BTC dominance could spell disaster for altcoins already trailing BTC in price action. Can Bitcoin Still Hit ATH? The question on the minds of crypto enthusiasts is whether BTC will achieve a new ATH during this rally. The answer is not straightforward. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Active Addresses Signals Golden Cross—What Next For BTC? Factors supporting a potential new ATH include the increased likelihood of pro-crypto US presidential candidate Donald Trump winning the election, the effects of BTC halving, increased inflows to BTC exchange-traded funds (ETF), and a low interest rate environment. On the contrary, sentiment indicators like the Fear and Greed Index suggest the market is still in a ‘greed’ phase, hinting that there could be more pain for the market before the next leg up. Regardless of the outcome, the crypto market will likely remain volatile in the coming days. However, long-term BTC holders do not appear fazed by this prospect, as profit-taking remained relatively muted when the digital asset crossed $71,000. At press time, BTC trades at $71,524, up a modest 0.6% in the past 24 hours, with a reported market cap of $1.41 trillion.

Even though the platform promotes blockchain interoperability, a feature needed in the age of increasing fragmentation, DOT prices have failed to inspire bulls. This state of affairs on price charts reflects the general trend across the board, especially in leading smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Polkadot Treasury Reserves Down To All-Time Lows Unyielding bears have been forcing prices lower over the months since DOT rose to around $10 in Q1 2024, depleting the Polkadot Treasury Reserves. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To New ATH Soon? Analyst Who Called $72,000 Surge Reveals What Needs To Happen In early November, one observer on X said they stood at all-time lows. However, it could get worse for Polkadot should the bears of Q3 2024 flow back, forcing prices below local support levels. The daily chart shows that DOT has critical support at around $3.8. This level marks September and October lows. On the other hand, the coin is facing strong liquidation pressure at $4.6 and $5. As the coin ranges, the direction of the breakout could shape the short—to medium-term trend but also impact the Polkadot Treasury. A lot depends on whether DOT prices will recover, which will, in turn, help the Polkadot Treasury reserves recover. Technically, prices play a big role. When bulls take over, the reserve, denominated in DOT, increases in USD terms, easing pressure on the team. Policy Intervention To Boost Funds To further increase inflows into the Treasury Reserves, the Polkadot community passed a policy to reduce inflation. Specifically, the community voted to drop DOT annual inflation from 10% to 8%. With low inflation and sustained on-chain demand, DOT prices may find support. Additionally, 15% of staking rewards distributed from stakers will be moved to the Treasury. Related Reading: Bitcoin Open Interest Reduced By $2.1 Billion In 24 Hours – Time For Spot To Push The Price? The analyst predicts these changes could boost the Treasury by adding 1.5 million DOT. This will be the much-needed infusion of funds that may increase the Treasury Reserves after months of low income. The team could build better and even strike quality partnerships, improving the blockchain’s ecosystem. Based on H1 2024 data, the team spent most on outreach, while nearly 27% went to development. The rest was split between funding research, operations, talent, and the economy. Given the valuation in the year’s first half, they spent $87 million, or around 11 million DOT, in total.

35499644,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651154,1730509220,Tracking Bitcoin’s Profit Cycles: Could A New Market High Be Near?,"Bitcoin price has seen many cycles over the years, marked by distinct growth phases, peaks, and corrections. To better understand these cycles, a CryptoQuant analyst, using the pseudonym ‘datascope,’ has highlighted the relevance of the UTXO Block Profit/Loss (P/L) Count Ratio Model. This tool offers unique insights into the balance of profitability and losses among Bitcoin market participants, serving as a lens to examine potential price reversals. By focusing on various moving averages, this model tracks price fluctuations and shows how profitability shifts within the market over time, offering clues about when new market peaks might form. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin’s Bull Market Just Beginning? Leveraged Bets Suggest Big Moves Are Coming Predicting Market Peaks Through Profit And Loss Ratios Datascope’s analysis highlights the significance of short, medium, and long-term trends captured by 7-day, 30-day, and 365-day moving averages. This multi-perspective approach is valuable for long-term investors and short-term traders, as it distinguishes between shifts impacting immediate market movements and those affecting longer-term cycles. The model demonstrates that changes in the profitability ratio are critical for gauging market sentiment and potential price movements. As Datascope explains, a decrease in overall profitability ratios suggests that short- and medium-term trading strategies may now be more practical, responding to a market less defined by extreme long-term price swings. One of the key findings from the UTXO P/L model is the behavior of the 30-day profit and loss ratio relative to the 365-day moving average. Datascope noted that when the 30-day ratio rises above the 365-day average, it could signal a new price peak. In simple terms, crossing short- and long-term profitability lines indicates that investor sentiment is shifting towards more profitable conditions. Price increases have historically followed this occurrence as optimism fuels further buying pressure. For instance, the analyst pointed out that while economic conditions varied between 2021 and 2022, similar trends were observed in the model during both years, particularly in how the profit and loss ratio used the annual moving average as a resistance line. Datascope suggests that if the profit and loss metrics consistently stay above the annual average, Bitcoin may be on track to establish new highs.

Despite the impressive BTC price hike, interest in the cryptocurrency is not picking up as Google searches remained flat. Related Reading: Cardano To Soar 22X? Analyst Sees Opportunity Despite On-Chain Decline Bitcoin Nears All-Time High Bitcoin still performed well last October 2024 despite experiencing a slight decrease in price, falling below $71,000 to $70,800 and failing to meet investors’ expectations of the coin hitting the $73,700 mark. Despite the dip, it has been a good month for BTC because its performance nearly reached an all-time high. Records showed that October has always been a pivotal month for Bitcoin to gain momentum for a price upsurge. According to Lookonchain, the cryptocurrency consistently obtained significant gains in October, a recurring trend since 2013. Last year, Bitcoin’s October rally brought a 28% gain for the coin which according to analysts paved the way to a five-month price upswing. During the bull run, BTC started at $26,965 and gradually gained momentum over the succeeding months, breaching the $73,000 barrier in March 2024. Will BTC repeat the same price movement as last year? A price rally could unfold as October 2024 ends. Interesting Phenomenon Bitcoin might be performing well and nearly hitting an all-time high, but an analysts noted a bizarre phenomenon. Analysts remarked that BTC is near its record high, but its online mentions are falling behind, saying, Google searches for Bitcoin remained notably low. It could mean that there is little retail participation despite the price upsurge. According to AltIndex, the cryptocurrency’s score at Google Trend is 37 out of 100, indicating that only a small number of people are searching for Bitcoin on the search engine Google. Related Reading: Analyst Eyes $6,000 For Ethereum As Key Support Level Emerges – Details BTC Bull Run And Google Searches Analysts said that there is a relationship between the previous Bitcoin bull run and Google Trends, adding that usually, bull runs coincide with an uptick in BTC search volume. Bitcoin’s bull run in 2017 serves as a prime example of this relationship. Analysts explained that during the said price rally, Bitcoin went up about $20,000 while its Google Trends score reached 80 out of 100. A trend that analysts have also seen during BTC’s bull run in the late 2020 to 2021. Historically, BTC price rallies occurred simultaneously with significant search interest on Google, something that is not happening yet at the moment. Would the search volume in Google remain a key indicator of BTC’s price movement? It is something that investors and analysts will have to keep an eye on the upcoming months.
