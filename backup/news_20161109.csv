42399474,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjF7l,1478719169,Former Estonian President to Lead World Economic Forum Blockchain Group,"The World Economic Forum has created a new working group focused on blockchain co-chaired by the former president of Estonia.  The Global Futures Council on Blockchain Technology will meet for the first time later this week during an event in Dubai. The group's focus will largely center on the development of ""governance models"" related to blockchain, according to the WEF.  Toomas Hendrik Ilves, who served as president of Estonia for 10 years before leaving office in October, will serve as co-chair alongside Jamie Smith, chief communications and marketing officer for bitcoin mining and blockchain services firm BitFury and a former official in the Obama White House.  Notable members of the group include Ma Jun, chief economist for the People’s Bank of China’s research outfit, and Claire Sunderland Hay, head of the Bank of England’s fintech startup accelerator. The group also include representatives from bitcoin and blockchain startups like BitPesa, Everledger, Ripple and Chain, as well as financial institutions like Barclay’s and Deutsche Bank. A full list of members can be found herehttps://www.weforum.org/communities/the-future-of-blockchain.  Ilves said in a statement:  “The distributed ledger or blockchain system of preserving data integrity and security is one of the most promising new technologies to emerge in the past decade. Its full potential is only now beginning to be realized. This Council will play a leading role exploring how blockchain can be used to improve security on the internet.”  The WEF has been conducting internal research into blockchain since the end of last year. The new group is part of a broader network of Global Agenda Councils, focused on issues like climate change as well as other tech areas like AI and cybersecurity.

42399475,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjF5n,1478716815,Veteran Bitcoin Legal Strategist Joins Firm Hosting Trump Transition Meetings,"Veteran bitcoin lawyer Carol Van Cleef has a new job.  The former partner at Manatt, Phelps & Phillips started her new position at Baker Hostetler earlier this month.  While Van Cleef will continue her previous focus working with bank compliance issues and cryptocurrency, she tells CoinDesk her new employer has hosted several meetings with people helping US President-elect Donald Trump transition to power.  Van Cleef explained the nature of her new position to CoinDesk:  ""I'll be heading the FinTech practice and continue to have a huge focus on virtual currencies and blockchain technology.""  Van Cleef began her new job on 1st November, after spending almost three years at Manatt. Previously, she founded anti-money laundering and OFAC compliance trading firm, Comptegrity, for which she still serves as chairman.  Over the past year, she has also helped develop the Uniform Law Commission's efforts to draft a legal framework for virtual currencies, and earlier this month she was one of 50 attorneys to join launch the Digital Currency and Ledger Defense Coalition.  At Manatt, her compliance practice had focused largely on helping companies understand the USA Patriot Act, BSA and OFAC regulations.  BakerHostetler was founded in 1916, and currently employs about 900 partners and associates. The firm specializes in litigation, business, employment, intellectual property and tax law.  According to an Intercept report yesterday, the firm had hosted ""regular"" meetings of Trump for America Inc, a non-profit group chaired by New Jersey governor Chris Christie, as part of an effort to help oversee the Trump transition.      An earlier version of this article based on the conversation with Van Cleef reported that Baker Hostetler was representing Trump's transition team. A representative of the company called CoinDesk to clarify, ""We’re not representing the transition team.""

42399471,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjF4o,1478709446,Alleged Bitcoin Scammer Busted By Dubai Police,"Police in Dubai have reportedly arrested a man accused stealing bitcoins from several individuals.  Local  sources report that three Dubai citizens were defrauded after connecting online with someone claiming to be a bitcoin buyer who wanted to purchase the digital currency at a premium.  According to Dubai police officials, those affected apparently let the suspect access their bitcoin wallets during the sale. Once inside, those accounts were emptied, with just over $100,000 in bitcoin being taken.  Dubai officials are said to have expressed concern about the nature of the crime. Salim bin Salmin, deputy director of the Dubai Police’s Cybercrimes Department, told regional news service 7DaysUAE.  “It’s hard to trace the money. There is no legal framework for it and UAE residents are not familiar with it or how to use it for trading.”  The suspect, who is facing fraud charges following his arrest, was reportedly arrested after police used Instagram to set up a sting operation. Officials used the social media app to create the persona of a wealthy investor looking to buy bitcoins.  ”We created an account for a young man, posted pictures of him looking wealthy and put up a message that he was looking to sell 1,000 bitcoins,” Dubai Police director Khamis Mattar Al Muzaina told the publication.  After the suspect was arrested, police determined that the funds had been spent on a variety of luxury goods as well as housing costs in Dubai.

42399490,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjFHb,1478705282,"Despite Trump Bump, Bitcoin Still Strives for 'Safe Haven' Status","""Not sure what to expect exactly...""  That the sentiment of at least one major bitcoin exchange executive yesterday as Americans took to the polls in what the New York Times would ultimately call a ""stunning repudiation"" of the political system. Hours later, Donald Trump, the billionaire and former reality TV star, was elected president, but the markets had already responded.  As reported by CoinDesk, many traders were expecting a Trump upset to boost the bitcoin markets, with some comparing it to a ""Brexit"" scenario for the global markets. In that surprise political turn, the price of bitcoin ranged sharply, trading from a low of $550 to a high of $650 when the final decision was announced.  However, last night's trading wasn't exactly the same story retold.  Data from wallet provider Blockchain indicates that USD exchange volume reached an annual high during the days preceding the Brexit, though this also coincided with a planned change to bitcoin's reward generation scheme.  By contrast, USD trading was muted in the days preceding the presidential election, and even the bounce many traders were expecting proved smaller than might have been anticipated.  Over the past 24 hours, the price of bitcoin rose from $709 to a high of nearly $740, though at press time, the price had declined to $725.  Despite this, though, it was still within striking distance of annual highs set in mid-June.  At press time, the price of bitcoin was up 67% from the $434-mark in January.  Safe haven status unsure  Yet, while Trump's victory was unexpected, the resulting boost to bitcoin doesn't appear to have done much to change the view of industry analysts.  Needham & Company's Spencer Bogart, whose firm issues periodic projections for the price of bitcoin, told CoinDesk there was unlikely to be a shift its short-term projections. Earlier this year, Bogart forecast bitcoin as likely to rise to a high of $848 on improving fundamentals and progress on its core technology.  Still, Bogart said that the bump served to underscore the idea that bitcoin is becoming a safe haven asset, even if he said the evidence isn't entirely there yet.  ""It’s another data point that further reinforces the notion that bitcoin rallies in 'risk-off' scenarios such as geopolitical uncertainty. By adding to this track record, the probability increases that bitcoin will continue to do so going forward,"" Bogart said.  Wedbush Securities director of research Gil Luria added that he does not believe bitcoin is yet correlated with other asset classes, including stocks, bonds, currency and real estate.  ""I do not believe there is evidence that bitcoin is counter-cyclical or moves in the opposite direction of other assets, and I am not yet convinced that we should refer to bitcoin as a safe haven asset,"" he said.  Muted response  Overall, the muted response, analysts said, was likely due to the fact that bitcoin is still broadly perceived as a high-risk investment.  ""Bitcoin has plenty of risks that are unique to the technology, which is why it is best suited for investors that understand those risks,"" Luria said. ""I consider a safe-haven asset an asset that has inherent downside protection, which I do not believe bitcoin will have any time soon.""  Still, there was a belief that behaviors such as last night's increase on election results could do much to change that perception, cementing bitcoin's use case as a store of value, if not an off-risk asset.  ""With events like today, we're seeing bitcoin perform as a safe haven, risk off asset in times like this,"" Mark Lamb, CEO of bitcoin exchange Coinfloor, said.  Yet, he went on to acknowledge it's unclear exactly how to classify bitcoin as of yet.  ""The fact that bitcoin grew massively in 2013 and is also growing in times of the 'Brexit' and Trump seems to demonstrate that bitcoin is uncorrelated,"" he said.  As mentioned by analysts, it's perhaps the unique qualities as well as the accessibility of the digital currency markets that will perhaps help them become more interesting to mainstream investors.  Bogart concluded:  ""We see these aspects as highly favorable for bitcoin as an investable asset.""

42399480,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjFAi,1478698224,Overstock's Blockchain and the War Against Naked Shorting,"Jacob Dienelt is the Managing Director of Brian Kelly Capital Management's Digital Asset Group. He is also an eight-year veteran of Morgan Stanley.  In this opinion piece, Dienelt looks at Overstock's planned blockchain stock offering, speculating on how this new technology will impact the company ahead.  Sometimes called the ""Pariah of Wall Street"", Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne has spent decades fighting against a suspect practice known as ""naked short selling"".  Naked short selling, or a naked short, occurs when a trader sells a share of stock without first procuring a ""borrow"" – an assurance that the shares are available to be delivered. This can lead to more shares being shorted than can actually be delivered to the buyers.  Banks could leave these unsecured shares short, as record systems are opaque, and despite risking severe penalties, the banks are not always completely honest.  During the financial meltdown of 2008-2009, naked shorting came into focus, and as a result, selling short bank shares was banned. The Salt Lake Tribune summed up the change in an article that later stated: ""These days, when people talk of Byrne, the word 'vindication' comes up a lot.""  But, Byrne wants more than vindication – he wants to win.  Byrne is a remarkable man. A doctor of philosophy, a Marshall scholar, a savant who can remember the order of a deck of cards years after seeing them, Mr Byrne has made it a personal mission to end naked shorting.  Surviving three bouts with cancer, several clinical deaths and recently returning from an ""indefinite leave of absence"" due to complications from Hepatitis C, it is clear – nothing will deter him.  If Byrne could find a way to expose what was hidden by the opacity of the legacy system, shorts would panic as they would be forced to immediately cover. The naked shorting Byrne has railed about would come to light.  Overstock could rally in a manner reminiscent of Volkswagen when Porsche made a takeover bid and several hedge funds were caught short. The resulting short squeeze briefly made Volkswagen the most valuable company in the world.  At Money 2020  , Byrne took the stage last month and announced his solution to the shorting problem.  Overstock will issue a special rights offering for preferred shares of stock on Overstock’s own transparent blockchain platform, tØ, a subsidiary of their blockchain investment holding corporation, Medici.  Notably, a week after the Money 20/20 announcement, Overstock delivered a mammoth quarter and jumped 15%.  Exposing the cheaters  Why the interest? Overstock’s blockchain does exactly what blockchains do best – stop people from cheating.  Blockchains are shared ledgers designed for a specific purpose: transparency. Naked shorting is impossible on Byrne's tØ as an ""unborrowed"" short would be easily identified.  When a special rights offering is made, shares are tendered to establish a record of ownership. For a period of time, these shares go ""in the box"" and cannot be moved.  While Byrne has long fought the battle against naked shorting, there may be more to this move. The offering documents are not yet public, but when the shares come “out of the box”, they could be reassigned to Overstock’s broker dealer. Further, Overstock itself could change its corporate registration to the in-development Delaware blockchain.  This option, which will likely be available this spring, would give back title in shares to shareholders instead of the DTCC. Byrne, as the largest single shareholder of Overstock, likely wants to wrest back title to all of his shares – not just those impacted by the rights offering.  If he’s been fully vindicated, reclaiming title surely is his next goal.  Knock-on effects  The rights offering is for 1 million shares of preferred stock and an equal tranche of common stock – bringing the offering to 2 million shares. After the announcement, a senior Overstock executive speculated that they may see an 80% shareholder acceptance rate – that would be 1.6 million shares, or about 6.3% of the float.  If Byrne manages to move all of Overstock’s issued shares onto the tØ blockchain, and it turns out there are naked shorts, it will be hard to predict what will happen.  Even if shares return to the regular system after the offering, Overstock could later decide to do a 95% rights offering – boxing in more than the even reported available float.  This would make Byrne and Overstock holders happy and could also have interesting knock on consequences. For example, the banks' most important customers (public companies) might demand that the trading of their shares be moved to transparent ledgers.  In this way, buying shares of Overstock could well prove to be the best way to profit from blockchain technology without buying cryptocurrency.

42399493,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjFMW,1478675166,Deloitte Opens Ethereum Identity Platform to Blockchain Developers,"""Papers, please"" is a phrase with the power to send shivers through the spines of immigrants and travelers the world over.  The ability to prove who one is has a long history of being abused by authoritarian governments and companies looking to generate revenue. But with the advent of distributed ledger technologies, that power is on the precipice of being offerred to the people by private companies for the first time.  One of a rising number of those firms is ""Big Four"" accounting services provider, Deloitte, which later today is expected to publicly announce plans to open-source its ethereum-based Smart Identity platform.  In conversation with CoinDesk, the CTO of Deloitte Digital UK explained why his firm decided the most logical step forward would be to give away a big chunk of its progress on blockchain identity so far.  Mike Robinson told CoinDesk:  ""The most critical success is going to be scaling adoption, scaling consensus, and we believe no one organization is going to be able to own it.""  Deloitte has yet to settle on the details of the exact open-source license under which Smart Identity will be handed over, but Robinson says ""the goal is to make this very free and easy to use.""  While Deloitte makes the final decisions on the license, no code has yet been released to the Smart Identity Github page.  Smart Identity  Currently, the Smart Identity platform consists of three main components: individual identity-creation, institutional identity creation and analytics.  In a demo of the product, the user receives three separate key-pairs at login. Each gives the user access to the service in various ways. The sign in key-pair, for example, allows users future access to the platform, while the encryption key-pair lets the user receive information and a final ethereum account key-pair lets the user write smart contracts.  The identity itself is then created by populating fields in an existing ethereum smart contract with any number of attributes. Such attributes could be a birth certificate, a drivers license or a passport. Then, a hash of that smart contract serves as the user's identification.  At that point, it's then up to a licensing institution like the Department of Motor Vehicles in the US or the Road Traffic Office in Switzerland to set up an account and endorse the documents or not.  The terms of the smart contract give institutions the ability to track points on a license, or rescind the license altogether if too many points accumulate. Individual users, on the other hand, could be informed if a license being rescinded might impact his or her ability to hold a bank account using it to verify identity.  Currently, the entire smart contract is hashed, resulting in a less personalized solution than UK blockchain lead Alexander Shelkovnikov hopes Deloitte will be able to offer in the future.  In later incarnations, each individual field will be hashed giving users a way to turn up and turn down identity information much like one might adjust the volume.  ""With Smart Identity these people would be able to first have full control over their identity and second who they share their identity with,"" said Shelkovnikov.  Once the identity is set up and verified, an analytics platform gives users the ability to track exactly which organizations can see what part of his or her identity and which terms of service one has agreed to.  ""They could create their identity records on the blockchain, and they would be able to add documents and share that in a much more secure way,"" Shelkovnikov added.  Building on identity  Deloitte's UK team first identified blockchain identity as a potentially valuable service in early January of this year.  By the end of that month, a two-person team was expanded to include a number of developers and incorporated Deloitte's larger European blockchain initiative, according to Deloitte technical architect Andy Loughran, who helped oversee the process.  But identity itself isn't where Deloitte expects to recoup its investment.  Instead, CTO Mike Robinson said the company wants to be able to charge for its services to help customers build new products that depend on more advanced identity control.  ""What we aim to do is get smart identity to the point where it's widely used,"" said Robinson. ""Then we want to use that to solve customer problems""  To do that, the various efforts inside Deloitte need to be coordinated and standardized to ensure the maximum efficiency, he said.  So, as part of today's announcement at Web Summit in Portugal, Deloitte is expected to formally call for both members of the credential-granting public sector and private companies to contribute to the project.  Building consensus  Potential competitors already building similar products include venture backed Shocard, Consensys's uPort and Blockstack Labs' Onename.  While it is unlikely that such competitors will ever lay down their respective efforts, there is reason to believe the ecosystem as a whole might benefit from increased cooperation.  In March, blockchain consultant and author of ""The Business Blockchain"", William Mougayar predicted that fragmentation among blockchain identity developers could hinder the technology's social benefits.  Don Tapscott, author of ""Blockchain Revolution"", lent his support to that position as well, arguing that increasingly it makes sense for competitors ""to place some capability in a commons and compete on a higher level.""  Tapscott concluded:  ""An open-source model makes a lot of sense because identity is central to almost everything that involves humans. The open-source model can help ensure that the best capability and uniquely qualified minds required can be brought to bear on the project.""

The price of bitcoin is hovering around $737 after rising from a low of $709 when polls in the Eastern US began to close, according to the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index. CNY markets are up 2.4%, reaching ¥4,959.11 at press time.  Polls prior to the vote on Tuesday pointed to a likely win for Democrat Hillary Clinton. But with the results rolling in, Trump's chances for success have grown. Right now, the election could still swing either way, ultimately depending on the outcomes in a handful of districts in US states like New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Michigan.  At press time, Trump has 244 votes in the Electoral College to Clinton's 215, according to CBS, and The New York Times is forecasting a Trump win.  US stock futures have reacted negatively to Trump's possible victory, suggesting rough waters ahead when markets open later today.
