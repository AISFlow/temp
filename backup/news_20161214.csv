42379080,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7muUd,1481754438,The Price of Bitcoin Has Stayed Above $760 for 7 Days,"Bitcoin (BTC) prices have been trading north of $760 for more than a week now, according to data from the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  The price has been lingering above this level during a seven-day period in which the digital currency hit a 34-month high. Markets surpassed $760 at 10:00 UTC on 7th December, managing to reach one week above this level early on 14th December, figures show.  Bitcoin prices surged to $788.49 on 13th December, which represented the currency’s highest price this year and also its most elevated price since February 2014.  Thus far in 2016, bitcoin prices have rarely surpassed $760, according to BPI data. The digital currency surpassed this price on 2nd December, the first time it had exceeded $760 since June, but quickly fell back below this level.  Over the next few weeks, bitcoin prices repeatedly flirted with their previous high of $781.31 reached in June, but continually failed to surpass that previous peak. However, on 13th December, the digital currency’s price broke past $781.31, hovering above that price for a few hours before declining back below $780.

42379068,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7muJJ,1481744384,Coinbase User Asks Federal Court to Stop IRS Bitcoin Subpoena,"A Coinbase customer has gone to court to stop the Internal Revenue Service from subpoenaing user data from the bitcoin and ether exchange startup.  According to new filings dated 13th December, Los Angeles-based lawyer Jeffrey Berns has disputed the legitimacy of the IRS effort to obtain three years’ worth of user records. The IRS pursuit of a ‘John Doe’ summons, begun last month, was approved by US Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley on 30th November.  Berns – who is being represented by the firm for which he is a managing partner, according to LinkedIn – is asking the court to invalidate its previous approval, or, alternatively, to put in place a protective order to stop the effort in its tracks. He argued that the John Doe summons “would constitute an abuse of process” and blasted the document request proposed by the US tax agency as “overbroad”.  Lawyers for Berns argued that the filing wasn’t the result of an effort to protect himself from any kind of tax investigation, writing:  “Instead, Movant’s intent is to protect the interests of all of Coinbase’s customers who are subject to this overbroad summons, even though the IRS has made no showing that any of them have engaged in suspect tax-avoidance conduct.”  When reached for comment, Berns Weiss representatives said the filing was, ultimately, submitted in support of users of Coinbase that could be subject to IRS scrutiny.  ""While Coinbase has a business interest in protecting its customers’ private information, it also has a business interest in not being adversarial with government regulators,"" the firm said. ""Further, to the extent that there may be a negotiation with the government regarding a possible agreement for the production of a subset of the information sought by the Summons, Coinbase’s customers should be fully represented in any such negotiation.""  Coinbase, when reached, said that it was aware Berns' effort.  “We are aware of the motion to intervene filed today by Jeffrey K. Berns in the IRS petition. We are tracking all court proceedings and look forward to engaging the IRS,” the company said in a statement. “We will keep our customers updated on any significant developments with respect to Coinbase's engagement on this matter.”  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Coinbase.

42379069,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7muLp,1481742092,US Standards Body Establishes Working Group for Blockchain Tokens,"The US branch of business reporting standards body XBRL has joined ethereum startup ConsenSys to develop standards for creating blockchain-based tokens.  Announced today, a new working group co-led by XBRL US aims to to eliminate transactional friction between blockchains and automate the tracking of tokens on a global scale. Current XBRL US members include the DTCC, Swift, Deloitte and Thompson Reuters, among others – all firms that have been experimenting with enterprise blockchain tech.  Cambell Pryde, president and CEO for XBRL US, argued that the development of standards in this area is key for future smart contract-based applications of the tech.  Pryde said in a statement.  ""Creating a standard method to tokenize transacted assets is necessary to communicate ownership and value. Without standardization, the speed, accuracy and automation promised by smart contracts on the blockchain, simply will not happen.""  The working group's formation follows other developments on the blockchain front for XBRL.  Earlier this year, XBRL announced a smart contracts and blockchain forum with speakers from itBit (now rebranded as Paxos), Markin and Nasdaq, among others. In August, the standards body joined ConsenSys and each of the “Big Four” accounting firms for an exploratory meeting aimed at weighing the creation of a blockchain accounting consortium.  The new blockchain tokenization working group aims to establish a development roadmap early next year.

42379076,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7muTN,1481727668,Swift’s Global Head of Banking Argues Blockchain Isn’t a Disruption,"Long before blockchain, inter-bank communication platform Swift was working to modernize the way financial institutions do business.  First published in 2004, Swift’s global standard ISO 20022 was collaboratively created by a consortium of six standards bodies also includinghttps://www.iso20022.org/sites/default/files/documents/general/InvestmentRoadmap.pdf the International Securities Association for Institutional Trade Communication and the Fix Protocol.  The open standard is being designed so that when it is implemented in the coming years it will help members more accurately and efficiently communicate with each other, regardless of network or any number of advances in technology. To date, over 11,000 institutions use Swift’s existing services.  Then came blockchain and other implementations of so-called distributed ledgers with the potential to streamline a wide range of work flows by giving counterparties an immutable, auditable, shared account of transactions without the need of a third party.  Companies like distributed ledger startup Ripple and others have set the global financial messaging platform square in their sites as the ultimate middleman to be cut out of the loop.  But this is not Swift’s first time facing the potential benefits, and threats, of a new technology.  Swift’s global head of banking, Harry Newman, is also the sponsor of both his firm’s current blockchain applications. Having run a series of tests on two very different blockchain use cases, he’s come to the conclusion that there’s nothing to fear from blockchain.  But that’s not because blockchain is harmless. Instead, Newman argues that blockchain is only as potentially disruptive as any other technology that might also help him better serve his members.  In conversation with CoinDesk at Swift’s New York offices, Newman downplayed threats of disintermediation from his upstart competitors, even as he spoke of blockchain's potential benefits:  ""If it makes sense to build it into our global payments innovation offering over the next few years then we will. That is why I don’t see this as a disruption. I see these as constructive technologies that can be examined and adopted and used.""  To discover if blockchain should be adopted into the payments transaction firm's services Newman established a blockchain lab in both the US and Europe. Currently, a team of about 10 employees from Swift’s standards team, securities experts, architects, developers and more are working on two active proofs of concept (POCs).  The first is a standing settlement instructions blockchain that could one day help banks improve the way they route messages to each other. But it's the second trial that has been making rapid progress over the past few weeks.  Unique use case  Last month Swift unveiled an implementation of the ISO 20022 standard on a blockchain built using the Eris/Tendermint consensus engine. The POC is designed to power smart contracts written in Solidity, a high-level programming language created for the ethereum blockchain.  In charge of the project is Damien Vanderveken, head of research and development at, SWIFTLab and a 12-year veteran of the company. The ISO 20022 blockchain POC was designed to accomplish two main objectives, according to Vanderveken.  First, he “wanted to assess how much of the existing standards could be used on a blockchain,” he said – including whether transaction data could be stored directly on the distributed ledger and how self-executing orders or smart contracts might be implemented.  But he also wanted to build a real-world use case to take to Swift’s member banks to demonstrate how a distributed ledger might help them better serve their clients. Specifically, they built the complete lifecycle of a short-term, fixed-rate corporate bond into the open-source Eris technology.  ""We wanted to assess how much of the existing standards could be used on a blockchain. Both in terms of information statically stored on the ledger itself,"" said Vanderveken. ""But also in the way that you can distribute logic on the ledger through smart contracts.""  To accomplish that, Vanderveken and Newman determined three main demands on the technology that would need to be implemented.  Leading up to the selection of the Eris platform, the Swift team had anticipated that the underlying technology would need to provide a permissioned blockchain solution that could only be viewed by relevant counterparties and regulators, be capable of supporting smart contracts, and employ a faster consensus algorithm than bitcoin’s proof-of-work.  The reason for that demand is that bitcoin’s blockchain is capable of transacting about 600,000 transactions per day, whereas Swift sends on average about 26 million messages during the same period.  Building a blockchain app  In addition to meeting the technical demands of the projects, Swift also selected the Eris technology – which will be rebranded to match the company’s new name, Monax, in the first quarter of next year – because the building blocks of its products are open-sourced.  Apparently, all Swift’s blockchain team had to do to begin work was scroll down to the the bottom of the Monax website and download the software for their operating system.  From there, the team of 10 multidisciplinary employees set about analyzing their own ISO 20022 business model to figure out where blockchain might be of assistance. The breadth of ISO 20022’s applicability, which covers banks, central securities depositories (CSDs) and High-Value Payments (HVP) services makes it a ripe source for transaction data.  The standard’s layered architecture consists of coded business concepts ""independent of any automation"", according to a white paper published on the POC in September. ""This then, seems a good place to look for content that can be shared and re-used"" via a distributed ledger.  After settling on a service that attempts to automate aspects of the life-cycle of a bond, Vanderveken’s team consulted sporadically with Monax technologists, regarding certain implementation questions, but otherwise built the app in-house.  Speaking with CoinDesk at a Wall Street Blockchain Alliance event last month, Monax co-founder and COO Preston Byrne confirmed his firm had answered basic questions from Swift’s development team, but said the project was otherwise created entirely independent of his company.  Byrne added that he believes his company’s technology is best suited to help prove the value of automating messages for which Swift currently serves as a middleman.  ""Their role is going to be to determine what the format of those messages must be,"" said Byrne. ""What [distributed ledger technology] allows them to do is it allows them to get deeper and deeper into the transaction.""  Vanderveken added that the proof of concept is already proving helpful in communicating the potential value of blockchain to Swift’s members:  ""When we show it to the banks and to some bankers, they actually tried to understand better how Swift could be a good partner to build an industry-scalable, reliable and secure blockchain.""  Hurdles to clear  But before those banks ever get to experience a Swift blockchain application, a few obstacles must be overcome.  As Swift’s global head of banking, Harry Newman’s main focus is what’s called the Global Payment Innovation (GPI) initiative, a rolling program of technology upgrades slated to go live over the coming years.  In its earliest incarnation, the GPI is slated to employ a series of improvements consisting of cloud computing upgrades and increased API accessibility.  But based on the success of these blockchain POCs, and potentially others in the future, the GPI could someday include streamlined, transparent services built on a distributed ledger.  In April, Swift co-published a report listing eight ""critical factors"" that need to be addressed prior to adoption of distributed ledger tech, including improved governance when things go wrong, compliance with regulatory requirements, and scalabilty.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Newman condensed the obstacles into two factors: scalability and maturity of the technology. Specific to the ISO 20022 blockchain POC, Swift concluded in the white paper that ""much more"" work is required before full implementation, even if there is ""real value to implementers"".  ""If it proves successful,"" Newman said, ""then we might progress in turn to a pilot, with interest in institutions, and then to live execution. It’s a question of where it fits in our approach, it’s all about laboratory work looking at new technology and business and if they work, then taking them on board.""  Future role for DLT  Even as work continues on a potential blockchain implementation of IOS 20022, the standard itself continues to garner mainstream adoption.  In September, at Swift’s annual scalability conference, the organization announced that over 20 financial market infrastructure providers had endorsed the roll-out of the industry-wide standards framework, including the Payments Market Practice Group, the Securities Market Practice Group, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and multiple European CSDs and Central Banks.  Vanderveken says the blockchain POC is being designed to ""better articulate"" to those clients and others the value that DLT can provide.  ""We are seeking to prepare for a future Swift DLT platform,"" he said.  Newman positions the increasing role blockchain is finding for itself in Swift experiments alongside any number of technologies that were once touted to end banking as we know it. Not the least of which are Internet protocol networks that actually ended up proving helpful to the payments message platform.  Newman concluded:  ""We accept, we understand, that there will be new technologies, we will keep abreast of them, we will make sure that we understand them and investigate them and deploy them when they make sense. That way is the only to be, actually.""

42379078,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7muX9,1481724002,The Resurrection of Public Blockchains,"Angus Champion de Crespigny is EY Americas blockchain strategy leader for financial services, where he works alongside Andrew Beal, a West Coast lead for the firm’s Blockchain and Distributed Infrastructure Group.  In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, Champion de Crespigny and Beal argue that public blockchains – long eschewed by traditional financial services firms – may soon come back into favor.  It's been a tough two years for public blockchains.  Regarded by many as a social experiment with little practical value beyond anonymous peer-to-peer payments, public blockchains have been shunned by financial institutions and others who have opted for permissioned networks with a little more control and perceived privacy.  This shouldn't have come as a surprise. It has played out this way before. In the 1990s, big companies wanted to be online, but they wanted to do it without the open web. Intranets were born out of this desire, yet, in the end, the open Internet won out.  Now, 20 years later, we are at a similar crossroads.  Private blockchains feel safer because the permissioned model is more familiar.  Open, transparent systems are a far cry from the ""walled gardens"" inside institutions today. It is like moving to the house across the street. Sure, your immediate surroundings are different, but your environment is largely the same. It is familiar. Moving to a new city, on the other hand, is a big adjustment, and it takes time. Nothing is familiar.  Utility over convenience  And yet for all of the uncertainty around public blockchains, there is still an enormous amount of utility in a completely open, transparent network.  Not to mention the almost childlike excitement that still comes from watching transactions being processed in real time on a block explorer. Even in their infancy, public blockchains have already proven to be superior record-keepers, and capable mechanisms for injecting trust into a global financial system.  People often forget that bitcoin was only the first iteration of a massively distributed public ledger. And still, seven years after its release, it is exceeding expectations.  Transaction volumes have grown consistently year over year, and it is arguably more secure than ever. There is a reason so many other chains still anchor to the bitcoin blockchain.  In a world where data integrity and security are the number one concern for corporate boards, the power of public blockchains cannot be overlooked.  Progress not perfection  Of course, public blockchains are not without their challenges.  There are nagging issues around performance and scalability, and the energy and hardware required to maintain massive public blockchains have at times rendered them too costly to operate. But if the 1990s taught us anything, it is that transformational change generally happens faster on open protocols.  We are already seeing this play out: open-source communities are tackling blockchains' technological and operational challenges, and they are doing it globally at a rapid pace.  The Linux Foundation's Hyperledger project now has over 100 members; roughly a quarter of whom are based in China.  Platforms that began as proprietary creations have been recently released as open source. Ethereum has made meaningful progress in addressing the performance and resource limitations, and many others have developed novel solutions to introduce more privacy and security into these open systems.  Technology thrives when there are vibrant developer communities testing and iterating, and public blockchains are the ideal sandbox for experimentation.  Looking ahead  All in all, the future of public blockchains is bright.  In the coming years, with continued development, these open networks will form the basis for a new class of products, services and marketplaces: digital, open, automated and interoperable.  As we look forward to 2017, with another year of experience with the sharing economy and the Internet of Things under our belt, one thing is certain: everyone and everything are becoming more connected.  People, infrastructure, devices, data – they are all coming together, forming more intelligent, more efficient networks. And as bitcoin has proved, the traditional network and marketplace models with a central authority sitting in the middle are no longer necessary.  Identity, ownership, processing, delivery, fees — it can all be accomplished and verified via math and code, often faster and more accurately. The value of public blockchains will become more evident as these new industries that depend on connectivity and interoperability continue to grow and mature.  One day in the not-too-distant future, public blockchains and the interactions they enable will likely be so ubiquitous that they are considered public utilities, like the Internet, the postal service, public broadcasting and the interstate highway system.  Access to these public blockchain utilities will be an assumed and expected right of every individual and organization. An open fabric for things like identity and payments will emerge. Private chains and applications higher up ""the stack"" will plug into these open networks to leverage the data and the customers they support.  But, public blockchains are one necessary piece of a larger puzzle that will transform how we do business.  Have an opinion on blockchain in 2016? A prediction for the year ahead?

42379089,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mudR,1481716848,CoinDesk's Most Influential People in Blockchain 2016,"In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, CoinDesk profiles the most influential members of the blockchain industry, a list informed by more than 2,000 responses in our reader poll.  If you're trying to take a broad look back at 2016 for bitcoin and blockchain, identifying the movers and shakers in the industry is a good place to start.  Since late November, CoinDesk has been canvassing the community for input on who our readers believe influenced the industry the most. Users were invited to choose one of the names we suggested or anyone they felt had the biggest impact on the year that was.  The results were both surprising and not – at times mirroring the feedback we received for our 2015 list. However, many of the names who made the top10 did not do so last year, meaning that for an industry in a state of evolution, the major players are seeing a degree of change as well.  With that, let's see who made the top 10 list this year…  10. Perianne Boring  Movement in Congress is, almost by definition, slow and ponderous. Yet, as head of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, Boring has played a key role in getting things done in a town where many things don't.  A former Congressional aide and journalist for RT and Forbes, Boring now spearheads conversations on Capitol Hill, effectively putting blockchain tech in the hands of US representatives and helping drive the conversation about the need for legislative action.  Under Boring's leadership, the Chamber has made smart contracts a major plank this year, hosting a symposium earlier this month that drew figures from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).  If 2016 was a year for sparking deeper conversation about digital currencies and blockchain in Washington, Boring was one of the key figures to light the way.  9. Chris DeRose and Junseth  The pundits of podcast Bitcoin Uncensored, Chris Derose and Josh Unseth (who prefers to perform under the moniker ‘Junseth’) turned the industry on its head in 2016 with their acerbic wit and, at times, blisteringly offensive approach to commentary.  It was an approach that won them plaudits from some quarters of the community and condemnation from others, an outcome that was maybe the intention all along. At the same time, their style has stoked its fair share of controversy, drawing accusations of sexism – as seen in the case of their interview with Chamber of Digital Commerce president Perianne Boring – that has perhaps undermined their message.  Notable interviews on Bitcoin Uncensored include convicted Ponzi scheme operator Trendon Shavers and Neo and Bee CEO Danny Brewster, but as the show has moved away from attack-style interviews it has also shown surprising depth.  For example, in a recent episode, the co-hosts sought to unveil a Craigslist Ponzi scheme only to find well-meaning boat salesmen using bitcoin for payment – work that has done much to showcase how bitcoin is that rare thing, a blockchain with a functional economy.  Whether you agree with them or not, DeRose and Junseth’s unique take on bitcoin podcasting – not to mention their behemoth, hours-long episodes – emerged as a dynamic force in the industry this year.  8. Richard Gendal Brown  The chief technology officer for R3CEV, Brown was a big force in 2016.  Apart from leading the technology push at the startup behind the 40-plus member bank consortium that has spent the past year and a half testing distributed ledgers, Brown was the leading figure behind its open-source code rollout, inviting criticism and contributions from the community at large.  And while Brown freely admitted that the work is far from complete, the debut was a big moment for the coders at the New York-based company.  It wasn’t just lines of Corda code that made 2016 a significant one, however. In April, Brown put forward his thesis about the tech, pitching the idea that a blockchain alone wasn’t enough to solve some of the key issues in banking today.  In effect, Brown argued that the status of facts shared between institutions is an area far more ripe for innovation than, say, payments.  Though Corda has a long way to go as a platform, its conceptual basis arguably impacted the industry and its trajectory moving forward.  7. Don and Alex Tapscott  The father-son duo behind 2016's defining book on blockchain, ""Blockchain Revolution"", Don and Alex Tapscott have become two of the tech’s leading voices on its advancement into mainstream finance.  You'd be hard-pressed to attend an industry event and not see either Tapscott diving deep into the tech’s bigger picture – see Don’s TED Talk on the subject for reference.  Yet for the Tapscotts, the work with blockchain extends beyond writing books and giving speeches.  Earlier this year, Don helped spearhead an effort known as the Muskoka Group. It’s an effort aimed at exploring governance solutions around blockchain, with an eye to involve figures at the municipal level that could one day see their governments change in light of the tech.  6. Pieter Wuille  A co-founder of bitcoin startup Blockstream and one of the more prominent developers on the open-source Bitcoin Core team’s bench, Pieter Wuille was a major driving force in bitcoin’s development this year.  A casual glance at Wuille's GitHub account reveals the extent of the impact, as he was responsible for hundreds of code commitments. According to Bitcoin.org, Wuille is the second-most prolific bitcoin contributor to date (only Bitcoin Core maintainer Wladimir van der Laan has issued more).  But it was Wuille who introduced Segregated Witness, an ambitious plan to alter how transaction block space is used to boost capacity that has stoked contentious and, at times, acrimonious debate amongst the bitcoin community.  His presentation took place during the Scaling Bitcoin conference in Hong Kong last year, setting the stage for back-and-forth between SegWit proponents and those calling for a boost on the maximum amount of data allowed in each block.  The work by Wuille and others on the SegWit proposal, which moved from testing to launch over the course of 2016, has set the stage for what will likely be bitcoin’s critical development arc in 2017. For Wuille and all the other bitcoin developers in the world, 2017 is on course for a defining year.  5. Adam Ludwin  It was last September that major financial services firms Visa and Capital One took part in the $30m funding round for Chain, which by the end of 2015 had wholly shifted from being a maker of bitcoin APIs to an enterprise-facing blockchain firm.  Just over a year later, that partnership with Visa bore perhaps its biggest fruit to date, with news that the card giant would seek to launch blockchain-based payment services in 2017.  As CEO of Chain, Ludwin was a key steward of Visa’s big step into the blockchain game. He also – in partnership with Visa, Capital One and other financial institutions like Citi, Fidelity and State Street – led the release of an open-source, permissioned blockchain protocol dubbed Chain OS 1, now Chain Protocol, its most ambitious release to date.  That's not to mention his keynote speech on blockchain before representatives from the world’s central banks, a speech that came amid a growing push among those institutions to explore and test their own digital currency systems.  4. Satoshi Nakamoto  The pseudonymous creator (or creators, depending on who you ask) of bitcoin, it was Satoshi Nakamoto who guided the digital currency’s early development until his disappearance several years ago.  Last year, however, the industry played witness to the dramatic allegation that Australian academic Craig S Wright was the mind behind bitcoin – a news development that drove headlines and shaped the industry that year as well.  Cut to 2016, when in May, Wright re-emerged from hiding in dramatic fashion. He declared his intention to prove his identity, only to stage a sudden reversal at the eleventh hour and state that he wouldn’t provide definitive proof amidst accusations of fraud.  Months later, the Wright story has largely faded into the background. And though the financial space has largely shied away from embracing bitcoin completely, Nakamoto’s role in the mainstream spread of blockchain remains undeniable in the eight years since his original white paper first appeared.  3. Andreas Antonopoulos  Ask the average community member who they think is the primary thought-leader and ambassador on bitcoin and you’re more likely than not going to hear the name Andreas Antonopoulos.  Author of ""Mastering Bitcoin""and a frequent speaker on the subject, Antonopoulos’ impact can arguably be seen through his travel itinerary – traversing the globe to speak to crowds of either rabid bitcoiners or skeptical bankers (depending on the venue).  2016 saw Antonopoulos branch out into other blockchain projects like ethereum, commenting on major developments such as the DAO collapse and putting forward the concept for a decentralized arbitration and mediation network inspired by the New York Convention. He announced a follow-up book, ""Mastering Ethereum"", in October.  Antonopoulos returns to the top-10 list this year, after being ranked as the number-one influencer in the space in CoinDesk’s 2014 10 Most Influential People in Bitcoin.  2. Vitalik Buterin  A year ago  , the ethereum project and its founder Vitalik Buterin were months out from their crowdfunding campaign, dogged by rumors of delays yet, at the same time, focused on projecting an outwardly positive outlook on the future.  With 2016 in the rear-view mirror, we think it’s safe to say that the last 12 months were a wild ride.  Helping spearhead the ambitious launch of Homestead, ethereum’s second major release, as well as the chaotic response to the collapse of the DAO, Buterin remains a singularly unique figure for the open-source project.  From tribulation to triumph, 2016 was the defining year for ethereum, in that its events shaped the kind of network ethereum is likely to become in the years ahead.  As one attendee of September’s DevCon2 conference would put it, 2016 was the year of hands-on development – a state of affairs that would likely have been untenable were it not for Buterin’s stewardship.  ""In the first year, everything was just smoke,"" technology consultant Carlos Buendia Gallego said at the time. ""Now we’re building real things.""  If the last year was any indication, 2017 will be a year of more building – for better or for worse – for Buterin and company.  1. The DAO Hacker  Like last year, the identity of our number-one winner is as yet unconfirmed.  The person (or persons) behind the attack on The DAO rocked the blockchain world this summer by exploiting what observers once described as a “come-in-and-take-free-money” sign built into the code.  The resulting scramble ultimately led to effectively rewriting the history of ethereum and investors exchanging their DAO tokens for ethers. But the effort left a sour taste in the mouths of some ethereum stakeholders, giving rise to the rival project ethereum classic.  Ultimately, at least some of the funds stolen – by way of the ethereum classic blockchain, which didn’t undo the thefts – would find their way to the exchanges and, presumably, the attacker’s pocket.  The DAO attacker earned the most votes among poll contributors, a reflection perhaps of the role he or she (or they) played in exposing the critical bug in the smart contract underlying the ethereum-based project.  The event also highlighted the danger inherent in smart contracts, providing a now-infamous reminder that even a single flaw in the code can have a devastating impact.

42379083,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7muZf,1481716821,Deutsche Bank's 5 Lessons Learned From DLT in 2016,"David Watson is the global head of product development for Deutsche Bank’s global transaction banking (GTB) business, where he works alongside Edward Budd, who leads the bank's strategy and planning for digital business models.  In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, Watson and Budd give their overview of what they've learned while exploring the technology over the last year, as well as their outlook for 2017 and beyond.  2016 will definitely be recorded as the year that infamously put distributed ledger technology (DLT) claims at the top of the hype curve and triggered the imagination of many.  Entering 2017, the general market sentiment remains that DLT will have a significant impact on financial services and the business models of its industry participants.  In this context, it will be crucial that any activities are driven by actual market needs and this requires a view on what this means for us in terms of business model evolution, but more importantly what it means for our clients and for their business – unrelated to financial services.  To make progress here means that our lines of enquiry need to look beyond 'sterile technology tests' to include a practical view on integration into the real world, and to include the schemes that form the legal and regulatory basis for implementation.  This can only be achieved collaboratively and requires an ongoing dialogue with industry partners, FinTech, clients and regulators alike.  There will be skeptics who assume the lack of overnight adoption and acceptance is a concern, but let's consider the early days of the iPhone – legal battles lasted several months with telecos before it was able to be launched.  When the first iPhone was released in 2007, it had zero apps and the second model, only six months later, had around 500. By 2011, the Apple App Store had over 500,000 apps to choose from. In that time, usage grew from under three million users to over 35 million.  Apple then partnered with FinTechs to develop further functionality and security of iOS, focused on safety of data and trialed its product in a sandbox environment to get customer feedback. By no means a quick evolution, but a fruitful one nonetheless.  This also highlights the phase we are just entering, development of apps/products in DLT, where the rubber hits the road.  Here are 5 lessons we have learned from DLT over the last 12 months:  1. 'Everything is a journey'  This technology will (and must!) evolve and with it new opportunities will arise.  Has 2016 witnessed progress in the journey to transforming parts of financial services? Yes. Have we crossed the finishing line yet? No. Will there actually ever be a finishing line? Possibly not.  Within the large portfolio of DLT activities there has been significant progress made, but the journeys we have seen to date clearly differ in speed and focus.  Our key area of focus remains the application of DLT to less digitalized securities markets with an emphasis on smart contracts.  Recently, we completed the next phase of our securities DLT business tests, building on our successful Smart Contract Corporate Bond proof-of-value (POV) back in 2015.  Of major interest for us this year has been the testing of practical integration points addressing functional capabilities such as SWIFT message matching, issuance, funding check, netting, interest payment, maturity and trading.  In the second half of the year, we further broadened our DLT investigations through the partnership in the Utility Settlement Coin (USC) consortium. This focuses on the exploration of the potential of relatively new digital concept such as ‘digital cash’.  The main area of interest for us in this context is what this could mean for the payment leg of the settlement of a security (the P in DvP, which stands for delivery versus payment), as well as the future of cross-currency transfers.  This is clearly a hot topic right now, as the German Bundesbank and Deutsche Boerse announced they would follow a similar route of discovery when referencing the development of a prototype leveraging DLT.  2. 'You need to learn to walk, before you run'  Maintaining compliance with regulation, legal frameworks and production assured technology is not optional, it is mandatory.  The key learning here is that investigations need to be broadened beyond the technology and – besides the crucial business model aspects – focus on market infrastructure as well as legal implications.  In order to comply with legal requirements, the main focus of use cases this year have used a permissioned ledger set-up (KYC and data protection policy compliant), as they are the more practical adoptions for the scenarios in question.  Especially in the wholesale post-settlement and clearing scenarios, they show more similarities to current legal and membership schemes for regulators, and are built with focus on safety and soundness challenges, as well as governance issues that may occur in-flight when DLT is applied for financial products and services.  This will not limit the scope of DLT application to these areas in financial services, but it can be expected that these more familiar areas will make concrete progress in the near term, whereas the ‘truly distributed’ adoptions will take longer with more rapid progress taking place outside of financial services.  3. 'The technology looking for the problem to solve'  Transformation outside of banking will define areas of future financial services products.  The danger when coming into contact with this topic for the first time is looking at it purely from a technology perspective and not considering that you are innovating for a moving target.  2016 has seen a variety of views on which business challenges match key attributes of blockchain and DLT application. The range of these has driven more constructive thought about where in the value chain or process we should start solving the problem.  For too long we have focused on fixing the backend of processes. The possibilities outlined by DLT have challenged this and triggered investigations into entire end-to-end processes.  While this mindset shift is a welcomed change, there nonetheless still seems to be a huge amount of activities focusing on current financial products, making them cheaper, faster and simpler.  Dealing with the challenges of today is important, but to make DLT a success you need to prepare for the needs of tomorrow. As Oren Harari said: ""The electric light did not come from the continuous improvement of candles"".  The other important aspect that frequently gets neglected is that this is not an isolated financial services debate and that if the industry verticals of our clients are looking to adapt this technology in parallel, this will change the way clients run their business and will lead to a whole new demand.  Art, music and even diamonds have adopted such technology for a single source of truth. And it’s likely we will continue to see more of this trend.  To prepare for this, we focus on regular client engagement and very practically have enabled this via regular design thinking workshops and client advisory board meetings throughout the year. The direct interaction with our clients helps us work to solve their problems and anticipate future needs.  4. 'There is only so much you can learn on your own'  Working collaboratively is the logical and practical way to make DLT happen.  The ongoing exploration into DLT continues to be a field in which high levels of collaboration between banks is evident, a trend still alien to some, yet very much a reality.  The ‘open’ theme continues in the form of the open sourcing of the basic technology (the latest example being R3’s move to make its Corda platform open source), which clearly indicates the shared view by industry participants that DLT can only successfully be applied when defined jointly.  That is not to say there is no value in driving this topic in-house.  There clearly is a need to understand what business model questions are worth solving and to assess the corporate capabilities needed to practically integrate this into your organization.  The network effect is important to DLT, but the shape of this network will be different by implementation and importantly may not always need total consensus to get started.  5. 'Blockchain is not a silver bullet'  Although DLT seems to be the number one digital trend out there, it might not be the biggest or nearest term shift we will see.  Another pitfall of the current DLT debate is also that it is often held in isolation and not reviewed in the context of the broader ongoing digitalization of our industry.  Depending on which piece of press you read, or which vendor you look at, it appears that each of the current digital trends – be it AI, IoT APIs, cloud – will be an independent revolution. That would be a lot of parallel revolutions and not exactly what is practically going on.  It is the combination of these – in particular APIs, cloud and FinTechs – that drives a shift towards open banking models leveraging these evolving technologies.  The structural impact of these trends is likely to occur sooner than ones triggered by DLT, especially as several are implicit to pending regulatory changes such as the EU's Payments Service Directive 2 (PSD2).  2017 outlook  So what is next in 2017?  There is already a visible shift in client engagement and we expect this to continue. What was once us pushing the digitalization agenda, is now a pull from the other side. Clients are approaching us about how they can get involved, explore digital trends and transform their businesses.  A significant part of the journey, though, has taken us to our clients rather than expanding project efforts to many products.  Digitalization is certainly not a hype and we aspire to engage closer with our clients, and our clients’ clients, to forge ahead and improve business.  Have an opinion on blockchain in 2016?
