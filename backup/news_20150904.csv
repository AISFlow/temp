42378304,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7fnt1,1441402622,Payments Vets Join Brazilian Blockchain Startup,"Brazil-based bitcoin startup Rippex has announced the former founders of digital payments gateway PagSeguro have joined its team.  Founded in 2007, the Brazilian payments solution provider is one of the more prominent online payments startups in the region, receiving coverage in international outlets such as NFC World and The Paypers. The startup is now owned by web content provider UOL.  Rippex  co-founder Rafael Olaio indicated that Ricardo Dortas Schonhofen and Paulo Lavinas Barbosa will join the company through a partnership with business development firm CloudPar, though they will be working in a full-time capacity.  He told CoinDesk:  ""For some time we have been designing models for financial institutions and thinking of how we could use this technology to improve payments. We thought they could be helpful for their practical knowledge in digital payments in scaling the company, because PagSeguro grew from one to 900 employees.""  Rippex, which runs one of two Brazil-based gateways for the Ripple payment network, suggested it is now increasingly focused on appealing to enterprise financial institutions with solutions for asset trading and international payments.

42378324,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7foAd,1441389321,Research: Ashley Madison Bitcoin Blackmail is Cheap and Profitable,"How much have Ashley Madison customers been blackmailed for since their personal data was leaked last month? One cybersecurity firm thinks it might have the answer.  In a 1st September blog posthttps://blog.cloudmark.com/2015/09/01/does-blackmailing-pay-signs-in-bitcoin-blockchain-of-responses-to-ashley-madison-extortion-emails/ from network security firm CloudMark, software engineer and research analyst Toshiro Nishimura suggested that as much as $6,400 may have been extracted from those seeking to buy the silence of the blackmailer.  CoinDesk reported last month that customers Ashley Madison, a website that advertised itself as a platform for infidelity, were receiving blackmail threats by email that contained personal information derived from the cache of released information.  Nishimura said the team tracked bitcoin payments around the time the blackmail threats emerged using blockchain analysis. The process looked for payments with bitcoin amounts consistent with the demands they reviewed – for 1.05 BTC – and showed little transaction history prior to the period.  Nishimura wrote of the findings:  ""We found 67 suspicious transactions totaling 70.35 BTC or approximately $15,814 USD within the extortion time frame of approximately four days paying 1.05 BTC to addresses, with no previous activity, and with two or fewer transaction outputs.... (We conservatively restricted ourselves to ordinary transactions with two or less outputs, thus excluding those which were less likely to be simple one-to-one payments.)”  Nishimura – who tempered his post by saying that the results are not as yet conclusive – went on to say that those conducting the blackmail attempts stand to benefit given the free cost of exploitable information and the cheap resources – an email and a bitcoin address – required.  He also speculated that, in the future, blackmailers may seek to further obfuscate their efforts in order to avoid identification, which he suggested could be achieved by tracing the addresses used in the blackmail emails.  “Since this search would not have been possible without the consistent extortion amount, we suspect that future attempts at Bitcoin-based blackmail will randomize the amount they demand,” he wrote.

42378318,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7fo87,1441380049,US Marshals: Final Silk Road Bitcoin Auction Likely for 2015,"The US Marshals Service (USMS) has revealed it is likely to auction off any remaining bitcoins confiscated from convicted Silk Road mastermind Ross Ulbricht sometime in 2015.  In total, the USMS seized more than 144,000 BTC (then worth $122m) from Ulbricht in late 2013 along with 29,655 BTC held in wallets on the online black market at the time of its closure.  The event will be the final auction involving bitcoins from the Silk Road investigation, with 44,336 BTC ($10m at press time) being offered up to prospective investors.  A spokesperson for the USMS told CoinDesk:  ""We still don’t have any dates to announce, but do expect to [hold the event] before the end of the year.""  To date, the USMS has held three auctions open to qualified members of the US public in a bid to auction off the assets.  The most recent event, held in March, saw 14 bidders vie to purchase 50,000 BTC (then worth $13.4m), with secretive bitcoin firm Cumberland Mining winning the majority – 47,000 – of the bitcoin up for sale.

42378312,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7fo35,1441373997,Bitcoin Spam Tests 'Could Violate UK Law',"The bitcoin stress tests planned by CoinWallet could breach UK law, a legal professional has suggested.  The claim was first posted on Reddit yesterday, with user 'btcdrak' asserting: ""The Computer Misuse Act 1990 in the United Kingdom makes it an offence to deliberately cause disruption to computer systems with intent.""  Eitan Jankelewitz, associate at UK law firm Sheridans, said he would tend to agree with this assessment.  The aim of these stress tests is to verify whether the bitcoin network is capable of handling a large stream of very small transactions. CoinWallet’s first test in June aimed to fill blocks with 105 BTC worth of miniscule transactions, but reached just 15% of its 200MB goal before its servers crashed.  ""I’m inclined to say there is a good argument that the CoinWallet stress tests would be a breach of section 3 of the CMA 1990,"" Jankelewitz said.  Reckless behaviour  ""The intention of CoinWallet in conducting the tests may well be to demonstrate the network’s capacity, but they should not be reckless as to the consequences of that test (section 3(3)),"" the lawyer explained.  Some Reddit users claim the tests are ‘authorised’ on the basis that they involve the sending of transactions, which is the primary purpose of the bitcoin network.  ""However,"" said Jankelewitz, ""The courts have previously said there is a limit to the amount of ‘authorised acts’ that are acceptable before the acts become unauthorised.""  He illustrated his point using Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks as an analogy, explaining that these attacks typically involve permitted acts, but the affected service provider does not authorise those acts to be carried out so many times that their service becomes overloaded.  When asked what he thinks of accusations that his company is planning to hold a live network – and potentially billions of dollars – hostage, James Wilson, COO at CoinWallet said: ""This is an absurd accusation. And if we were able to hold billions of dollars hostage, then it is pretty good evidence that bitcoin is worthless.""  CoinWallet is planning to carry out the next test at 10:00 (GMT) on Thursday 10th September.

42378308,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7fny3,1441365368,Bitcoin Wallet Provider Blockchain Currently Offline,"UPDATE (4th September 18:45 BST): Bitcoin wallet service Blockchain is accessible once again.      Blockchain, the operator of the world’s most popular bitcoin wallet service, is currently offline.  CoinDesk was last able to retrieve data from the site’s API at 05:44 UTC this morning, with a Reddit user noting the issue at around 07:00.  At press time, a message on the site’s homepage read: “We will be back shortly. Blockchain.info is currently down for maintenance. For status updates please see Twitter. Apologies for any inconvenience.”  A tweet by the company’s Twitter account stated similar information:    We are currently undergoing some maintenance but will be back online shortly. Be sure to follow @blockchain on Twitter for the latest news.        — Blockchain (@blockchain) September 4, 2015      Blockchain  co-founder Nic Cary told CoinDesk the downtime was down to the company ""installing some new equipment"", adding that it has been ""growing fast"" lately.  The company’s outage follows a six-hour period of downtime experienced by global bitcoin marketplace LocalBitcoins earlier this week.  LocalBitcoins’ community manager 'Max' said in a post on Reddit the problem was related to server issues: ""It seems a server got hung up ... We're about to move to new equipment as the current servers are quite old, sad that they had to crash before we moved.""

42378307,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7fnvX,1441361606,Timeline: What Central Banks Have Said About Bitcoin in 2015,"Bitcoin was designed to be a decentralised peer-to-peer payment protocol and one that would fall outside the control of both governments and banks.  This, however, has not prevented central banks from voicing their opinion on the digital currency and its potential regulation.  Although bitcoin regulation continues to be a contentious subject, some central banks have said it is necessary. Others have assessed the potential costs of regulation and realised that this would not outweigh the benefits.  Additionally, institutions have explored both the risks and benefits associated with the use of bitcoin and blockchain technology.  Who's said what and when?
