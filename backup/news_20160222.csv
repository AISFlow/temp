42378618,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iqJP,1456176189,Trade Settlement Giant DTCC to Host Blockchain Event,"Post-trade financial services giant DTCC has announced it is to host a blockchain event next month in New York City.  Called the Blockchain Symposium, the day-long event will explore the business applications of blockchain technology for financial market infrastructures and the industry.  The firm told CoinDesk in an email:  ""The aim of the program is to cut through the hype, discuss collaboration and use cases, and imagine what innovations the future may bring.""  The 29th March event will feature Blythe Masters, CEO of blockchain startup Digital Asset Holdings, and J Christopher Giancarlo, Commissioner at the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  The news follows DTCC's release of a report that, while recommending industry stakeholders experiment with blockchain implementations, cautioned against the growing hype surrounding the technology.  The report, entitled ""Embracing Disruption: Tapping the Potential of Distributed Ledgers to Improve the Post-Trade Landscape"", offered a measured endorsement of the technology and identified several features that could be applied to the post-trade industry.  For more information on the event, including its registration fees and ticket availability, visit the DTCC's official website.

42378620,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iqLv,1456172115,"California Bankruptcy Judge Says Bitcoin is Property, Not Currency","A US district judge has ruled, for the purposes of a bankruptcy case in California, that bitcoins are a kind of intangible property.  As reported earlier this month by CoinDesk, the US Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California is hearing a case filed by the bankruptcy trustee for HashFast, a bitcoin mining firm that declared bankruptcy in 2014.  The trustee is suing a former promoter for HashFast, Mark Lowe, and is seeking the return of 3,000 bitcoins alleged to have been fraudulently transferred to Lowe prior to the firm's collapse.  In recent weeks, both sides have submitted arguments over whether bitcoin should be considered a currency or a commodity for the purposes of the case.  At stake is roughly $1m in value. If bitcoin is deemed a currency, then Lowe would only have to return the 3,000 BTC at the value they held when he received them, which amounts to about $360,000. If deemed a commodity, then the appreciated value of that 3,000 BTC – about $1.3m today – is up for grabs.  During a hearing on 19th February, US Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali sided with the trustee, declaring that bitcoin is an ""intangible personal property"" rather than a currency.  Lawyer Brian Klein of law firm Baker Marquart, one of the attorneys representing Lowe, pushed for the court to pay attention to how the bitcoins were treated when Lowe was being paid for promoting HashFast's products – in this case, bitcoins were being treated as the same as dollars at the time.  Yet, Montali disputed that notion, stating that bitcoins and dollars are not the same, saying:  ""But that doesn't make [bitcoins] dollars, that’s my point. I understand how the parties acted, but that doesn't make them dollars.""  The matter up for discussion wasn't entirely settled, as Montali indicated that he would, for now, only weigh in on the currency vs commodity angle.  Montali said that he would return to the question of whether, if required, Lowe would transfer the 3,000 bitcoins or the equivalent dollar amount.  The judge indicated that he would issue an order on the decision, which at press time is currently unavailable.  Limited impact  As noted by industry experts, the ruling will add to relevant case law concerning the question of how bitcoin should be treated in civil legal cases, though it is likely to have few larger ramifications.  For example, while US agencies like the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) have ruled bitcoin should be treated as a commodity, other federal agencies are likely to rule differently as they seek to define the technology under their mandates.  The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for instance, has been encouraged by blockchain advocacy group Coin Center to consider how some uses for bitcoin may meet its definition for security, while others may not.  Other US regulatory bodies may come to similar conclusions, suggesting there may be no one definition for how bitcoin ultimately falls under US law.  This article has been updated for clarity.

42378617,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iqI9,1456167692,International Securities Regulators Commit to Blockchain Research Effort,"An international organization composed of the world’s top securities regulators is set to delve into blockchain technology research.  The International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), founded in the early 1980s, is dedicated to fostering cooperation between global securities regulators, particularly in regards to standards development and information exchange.  According to a news release, the topic of blockchain tech was of particular interest during discussion sessions at the meeting, held on on 16th-18th February in Madrid.  The organization said:  “On identifying and responding to emerging risks, the meeting last week was preceded, firstly, by Round Tables discussing recent market developments and volatility in world capital markets and, secondly, the challenges and opportunities posed by FinTech and – more particularly - distributed ledger technology – or blockchain.”  During the meeting, participants agreed to to conduct “further research on financial technology subsectors with particular relevance for securities regulators, including blockchain”.  The topic of bitcoin and blockchain has come up at the IOSCO in the past, including during an April 2014 presentation prepared by the organization’s research arm that cited “bitcoin crowdfunding” as one of several potential future challenges.  Support for the technology appears to come from the top of the organization as well.  David Wright, IOSCO’s secretary general, told the financial information publication SNL Financial in a December interview that the possible transparency gains blockchain tech could bring present an opportunity for securities regulators.  ""You know who's bought the particular product, so that's good from a market abuse perspective, of controlling market abuse,” he said at the time.

42378616,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iqGt,1456164879,Joi Ito: Why I'm Worried About Bitcoin and the Blockchain,"Joichi Ito is the Director of the MIT Media Lab and Chairman of the Board of PureTech Health. He is on the board of the Sony Corporation, The New York Times Company and others, and has created Internet companies including PSINet Japan, Digital Garage and Infoseek Japan.  In this opinion piece, Ito looks at the current state of the bitcoin and the blockchain, calling for unity and collaboration amid an uncertain time for the industry.  In a previous post, I wrote that I believe the blockchain has the potential to be as disruptive – and unlock as much opportunity and innovation – as the Internet, and that it could become a ubiquitous, interoperable, reliable, low-cost network for transactions of various kinds.  But along with that enormous potential, the blockchain also faces challenges that are similar to, but in many ways very different from, what we had and continue to have with the Internet and the Open Web.  I'm worried about the current situation of bitcoin and the blockchain.  Partially driven by the over-investment in the space, and partially by the fact that bitcoin is much more about money than the Internet ever was, it is experiencing a crisis that doesn't really have any parallels in the early days of the Internet.  Nonetheless, the formation of the Internet offers some important lessons, most importantly, on the question of the talent and knowledge pool.  Lack of understanding  In those early days, and at some layers maybe even still today, there were only a very small number of people who had the background, brain type and personality to understand some of the core elements that made the Internet work. I remember when there were only a handful of people in the world who really understood Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and we had to hunt them down and share them with our ""competitors"" when we were setting up PSINet in Japan.  It's very similar today with bitcoin and the blockchain.  There are a small number of people who understand cryptography, systems, networks and code and are capable of understanding the bitcoin software code. Most of them are working on bitcoin, while some are working on Ethereum and other ""related"" systems, and a few more are scattered around the world in other places.  It's a community including some who have been around since the 1990s, before the Internet, going to crazy conferences like the Financial Cryptography conference. Like any free and open-source software community on the Internet, it's a bunch of people who know each other and mostly, though not always, respect each other, but which fundamentally holds a near monopoly on talent.  Unfortunately, the wild growth of bitcoin and now ""the blockchain"" has caught this community off guard from a governance perspective, leaving the Core developers of bitcoin unable to interface effectively with the commercial interests whose businesses depend on scaling the technology.  When asked ""Can you scale this?"" They said, ""We'll do the best we can.""  That wasn't good enough for many, especially those who don't understand the architecture or the nature of what is going on inside of bitcoin.  Many companies that are used to making decisions around less complicated systems – like building a website or buying and running Enterprise Resource Planning systems – felt they could either just hire other engineers who would listen to the customer needs better or became so annoyed with the, ""we can't promise but we'll try"" attitude of the Core developers that they lowered their standards and went with whomever would promise to meet their demands.  Caution is needed  The future of bitcoin, decentralized ledgers and other blockchain-like projects depends on this community.  Many people call them ""Bitcoin Core"" as if they are some sort of company you can fire or a random set of developers with skills that you can just train others to acquire. They're not. They're more like artists, scientists and precision engineers who have built a shared culture and language.  To look for another group of people to do what they do would be like asking web designers to launch a space shuttle. You can't fire a community and, statistically speaking, the people working on the bitcoin are the community.  If you try to build ""something like bitcoin but better!"" it will probably turn out insecure, underwhelming and will go against the the fundamental principles that give bitcoin the potential to be as impactful to banking, law and society as the Internet has been to media, communication and commerce.  Bitcoin is an open project, with a sometimes inefficient but open community process that always pushes for the fundamentals of decentralization, robustness, and innovation.  But bitcoin isn't a single installation, it's a living, working system that presents a $6.5bn bounty for anyone who can break it.  This high valuation causes a great deal of caution and testing before anything is deployed on its network, but we can be quite sure that many many people have been thinking about how they can break the system and have so far failed.  Ethereum and Ripple are probably the two next largest networks in the $100m-ish range – Ripple with a fundamentally different consensus protocol and Ethereum with interesting and useful features.  If you can't do certain transactions or develop certain application on bitcoin, I can see why Ripple or Ethereum might be interesting.  If you're serious about security and stability – and you should be – bitcoin is almost the only choice with the largest bounty, and largest community, with the most practical modern experience deploying to a broad and active network in the real world.  Open innovation at stake  Many people are so excited about the potential applications that they have ignored completely the architecture of the system on which they would run.  Just as many Internet companies assume that the Internet works on its own, they assume that all blockchains are the same and work, but blockchain technology is not as mature as the Internet where you can almost get away with that. They often view the people working on bitcoin as a bunch of crazy Libertarians who came up with a cool idea but believe that a bunch of hired guns could put the same thing together given enough money.  Governments and banks are launching all kind of plans without enough thought going into how they're actually going to build the secure ledger.  I fear that we'll build something that at the application layer looks like what bitcoin and the blockchain promised, but under the hood is just the same old transaction system with no interoperability, no distributed system, no trustless networks, no extensibility, no open innovation, nothing except maybe a bit of efficiency increased from new technology.  We have a good example of that. One of the key benefits of the Internet was that the open protocols allowed innovation and competition at every layer, with each layer properly sandwiched between standards developed by the community. This drove costs down and innovation up.  By the time we got around to building the mobile web, we lost sight (or control) of our principles and let the mobile operators build the network. That's why on the fixed-line Internet you don't worry about data costs, but when you travel over a national border, a ""normal"" Internet experience on mobile will probably cost more than your rent.  Mobile Internet ""feels"" like the Internet, but it's an ugly and distorted copy of it with monopoly-like systems at many layers. This is exactly what happens when we let the application layer drag the architecture along in a kludgy and unprincipled way.  Human cost  Lastly, but most importantly, we're burning out those developers who we most need to be focused on the code and the architecture. Many are dropping out or threatening to drop out. Many are completely discouraged and depleted by the public debate.  Even if you believe that we will eventually have a new generation of financial cryptographers, you can't train them without this community. We have many smart people on all sides of this debate and I think that most of them are doing what they are doing with good intentions.  However, those of us on the sidelines fanning the flames, making uninformed and provocative statements and fundamentally disrespecting and undervaluing the contribution of the bitcoin community to the past, present and future of this possibly world-changing innovation, are doing harm.  I've been sitting back quietly hoping that things would just calm down, and they might eventually. But I see more and more misinformation and hype with ""blockchain"" being reduced to the same useless suitcase words that ""IoT"" and ""the cloud"" have become and it makes me sad, and a bit mad.  I've decided to spend the next chunk of time trying to counteract or balance some of the most misguided stuff that I'm seeing in areas that will have an impact on our future.  It feels like while the Bitcoin Core development community is robust, the ecosystem of stakeholders and the understanding of how decisions are made and information is shared is still fragile and vulnerable.  I fear that the communication and now emotional rift between various key groups and individuals is wide right now, but I believe it's imperative that we try to bring the community together and focus on executing on a shared technical plan that represents our best shot at broad consensus from both a technical and a practical perspective.  Hopefully, we can build a community and a process that is more robust and can handle the inevitable disagreements in the future in a less emotional and more technical and operational way.

42378623,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iqOR,1456153628,Coinbase CEO Rejects Proposal for Bitcoin Hard Fork in 2017,"Brian Armstrong, CEO and co-founder of bitcoin wallet and exchange service Coinbase, has spoken out against the latest proposal introduced as part of bitcoin's ongoing scaling debate, calling the agreed-upon measures, ""too little, too late"".  At the end of last week, a group of representatives from the bitcoin mining and services sector, as well as Bitcoin Core developers, agreed to a plan that involved support for a proposed change to bitcoin's code called Segregated Witness, followed by a network hard fork – which would require users to download new software to stay compatible with the network – in 2017.  In total, the changes could raise the capacity of transaction blocks on the bitcoin network to as high as 4MB, proponents say, though this would happen over a period of months.  In a new blog post, however, Armstrong argued the proposal is ""missing the mark"", stating his belief that the Segregated Witness proposal ""is not a good solution to help bitcoin scale"" as it overstates the capacity increase it would bring to the network.  Armstrong wrote:  ""If the plan is followed as written, SegWit would provide a slightly less than doubling of capacity by April 2016. Then we would go another 15 months (until July 2017) without any additional capacity increase. If bitcoin transactions per day continue to more then double annually, as they have been for the past few years, we will be in a worse position than we are today in the first half of 2017. This feels like a major oversight of the proposal.""  With the remarks, Armstrong has emerged as the highest-profile critic of the new proposal, a group that also includes Xapo CEO Wences Casares.  Announced this weekend, the 2017 hard fork proposal saw a broad array of industry participants aligning around a roadmap that aims to bring together two opposing sides in the long-running block size debate.  Call for action  Overall, Armstrong proposes that a better solution for the scaling issue already exists in the form of the alternative proposal Bitcoin Classic, which would immediately increase the cap on the size of data blocks to 2MB, up from 1MB today.  Of note, is that the Coinbase CEO questioned the politics involved in the latest agreement, saying that ""it perpetuates a centralized, single party system, in bitcoin"".  Rather than a single group deciding on bitcoin's future, ""bitcoin would be better off with a multi-party system, where several teams compete to add features to the protocol"". This would allow the industry to ""vote"" on which system to adopt, he suggests.  He further critiqued the latest agreement as merely ""a series of words"", adding that there is no guarantee that they will be upheld by signatories.  In the end, Armstrong calls for bitcoin miners and business owners to upgrade to Classic, saying it will bring ""immediate relief to bitcoin’s scaling problem and help restore confidence in the system"".  If implemented, Classic would trigger initial block size increase to 2MB. This activation is contingent on 75% of the past 1,000 bitcoin transaction blocks being mined with the new code.  Once that happens, the changes would kick in after a 30-day waiting period.  Disclaimer: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Coinbase.
