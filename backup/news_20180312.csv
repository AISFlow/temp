42401231,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcMVUU,1520891710,What's Wrong With John Oliver's Bitcoin-Beanie Baby Comparison,"Most of John Oliver's send-up of cryptocurrency was spot on.  On Sunday night's episode of ""Last Week Tonight,"" the HBO host poked fun at bitcoin community icons and reminded viewers to exercise caution when investing.  ""The important thing to remember here is this is a brand-new, very complicated space and literally nobody knows how it’s going to develop, so you need to be careful,"" he said.  Oliver's explanations of blockchain technology and the nascent cryptocurrency industry were generally accurate, and the notes of caution were appropriate. Speaking of notes, guest star Keegan-Michael Key's parody of Carlos Matos, the exuberant Bitconnect promoter, drove the point home when he bellowed: ""Re-spon-si-bility!""  But in one important respect, Oliver missed the mark by a long shot.  In his efforts to relate the story to a broad audience, the comedian trotted out a tired analogy, comparing bitcoin's volatile price to a $15,000 Beanie Baby, the plush toys that drove Americans into a buying frenzy circa the late 1990s.  He also described buying cryptocurrency as pure gambling, not investing – an oversimplification, to say the least.  Beanie bust  It’s worth nothing that it's been two decades since the Beanie Baby craze of the 1990s, and that some of the toy animals still sell for thousands of dollars online. Rare-toys appraiser Bruce Zalkin, for example, told The Wall Street Journal a trio of Beanies that sold for roughly $1,299 in 1998 would probably fetch $50 today.  This devaluation highlights what makes Beanies fundamentally different from cryptocurrencies. Beanies didn’t introduce any new technology to the collectibles market. Aside from unique traits such as color, these toys have generally remained the same over the years.  By comparison, bitcoin offered the building blocks for the blockchain technology boom sweeping the globe.  This technology is being applied to everything from medical records to real estate transactions and derivatives. Cryptocurrency itself already has diverse use cases, such helping sex workers safely store wealth despite discriminatory banks. Some entrepreneurs, like Korean beauty entrepreneur Sunny Park of Moonic skincare, accept cryptocurrency to help international customers avoid costly conversion rates and credit card fees.  A Digital Asset Research report in 2017 went so far as to estimate current bitcoin use cases would make the currency worth around $2,074 without speculation. Even if that's well below the current market price, it sure as Satoshi ain't zero.  Developer Jimmy Song, a partner at Blockchain Capital, points out that decentralization plays a huge role in differentiating bitcoin from other speculative assets.  He told CoinDesk:  “Beanie Babies are made by Ty and you have to trust them to not flood the market with the more Beanie Babies... Bitcoin is more like gold which is also not produced by a central party.”  Plus, bitcoin’s underlying structure continues to undergo technological improvements.  A Beanie or gold ring purchased today won’t gain any new features as it sits on the shelf. Meanwhile, people around the world are working to make bitcoin faster and easier to use. If someone goes to use his or her cryptocurrency stash after several years of storage, this digital asset may have gained new capabilities.  It may even offer access to additional tokens deposited by an airdrop, such as when bitcoin owners claimed free bitcoin cash tokens after the bitcoin network fork. These users passively collected new tokens just by owning bitcoin.  Physical vs. digital  In this way, comparing a dynamic cryptocurrency to a physical asset is apples-and-oranges at best.  Bitcoin is both traceable and generally fungible, i.e. mutually interchangeable (though to be fair these characteristics can conflict with each other).  By contrast, some physical assets are registered or certified, while bars of gold may be theoretically interchangeable. Few assets offer both options. Song pointed out how bitcoin’s characteristics differentiate it from other assets.  “Besides decentralization, these properties include fungibility, portability, durability, verifiability and divisibility. Clearly, Beanie Babies vary in quality, even among the same exact toy. They must be shipped and can get damaged. They are certainly not divisible to smaller units,"" he said.  Blockchain-based collectibles like the ethereum-fueled game CryptoKitties have much more in common with Beanies. They are valued for their rare traits and primarily used for entertainment or trading. Yet, even digital kitties offer potential beyond their soft and squishy predecessors.  People can breed their CryptoKitties to create a new digital asset, which is obviously impossible with physical collectibles. Bryce Bladon, communications director at CryptoKitties’ genesis studio Axiom Zen, told CoinDesk:  ""Personalization, interactivity, extensibility – these are all things possible with things like cryptocollectibles.""  All things considered, the only thing Beanies have in common with bitcoin is scarcity.  As for the gambling comparison, cryptocurrency is an extremely risky investment, as Oliver rightly pointed out. But depending on the buyer, it is not necessarily a roll of the dice, because expert insight can decipher which cryptocurrencies have functioning use cases.  The rest may indeed turn out to be collectible fluff.

42401225,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcMVPZ,1520888777,"Central Bank Digital Currencies Could Fuel Bank Runs, BIS Says","A central bank-issued digital currency (CBDC) could fuel faster bank runs during periods of financial instability, the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) said Monday.  The institution - considered by some to be the ""central banks' central bank"" – argued those looking to develop and launch a wholly digital currency should ""carefully weigh"" the implications of doing so, especially as they relate to monetary policy and overall stability. In sum, the BIS noted that a currency of that nature ""might be useful for payments but more work is needed to assess the full potential.""  ""A general purpose CBDC could give rise to higher instability of commercial bank deposit funding. Even if designed primarily with payment purposes in mind, in periods of stress a flight towards the central bank may occur on a fast and large scale, challenging commercial banks and the central bank to manage such situations,"" the BIS stated at the outset.  Later on, the report's authors revisited the subject, outlining a hypothetical situation in which banks – even stronger ones – could face issues during a bank run thanks to the ease at which a depositor could move their funds by way of the digital currency.  The report explains:  ""Depending on the context, the shift in deposits could be large in times of stress. A crucial element in such system-wide shifts is the stronger sensitivity of depositors to the actions of others. The more other depositors run from weaker banks, the greater the incentive to run oneself. If CBDC were available, the incentives to run could be sharper and more pervasive than today, as the CBDC would be the favoured destination, especially if deposits were not insured in the first place or deposit insurance was (made more) limited. Whereas weaker banks could experience a run, even stronger banks could face withdrawals in the presence of CBDC.""  ""It would be difficult to stem runs under such conditions, even when providing large lender of last resort facilities,"" the report adds.  The BIS has taken a somewhat middle-of-the-road view toward distributed ledger applications, expressing a belief through past reports that the technology is promising yet is unlikely to be used widely by banking institutions in the near-term. By contrast, its senior leaders have sharply criticized cryptocurrencies in the past.  Whether such concerns forestall any central bank-issued currency of this kind remains to be seen. As it stands, a number of institutions have looked at the idea of using some cryptocurrency elements as part of their digital money projects. Last week, Yao Qian, who heads up the People's Bank of China's research in this area, argued that some characteristics should be incorporated.

42401235,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcMVXR,1520882746,Report: South Korea Could Ease Its ICO Ban,"South Korea's ban on initial coin offerings (ICOs) could be eased in the coming months, according to a new report.  CoinDesk reported in September that the country's Financial Services Commission had moved to prohibit the blockchain funding model. Yet a new report from the Korea Times suggests that the ban may be lifted in part, specifically for token sales that meet as-yet-to-be specified conditions.  An anonymous source told the newspaper:  ""The financial authorities have been talking to the country's tax agency, justice ministry, and other relevant government offices about a plan to allow ICOs in Korea when certain conditions are met.""  Despite the local ban, many Korean cryptocurrency users are still participating in international ICOs. Kang Young-soo, the regulator that oversees cryptocurrency trading policies at the Financial Service Commission (FSC), declined to comment on ICOs other than to say the FSC is considering a ""third party view.""  Additionally, Young-soo affirmed that the government wants to advance blockchain technologies and create a better infrastructure for regulating cryptocurrency trades.  However, international cryptocurrency market presents new challenges for lawmakers.  As it stands, overseas residents are currently banned from trading cryptocurrency in South Korea. This restriction is aimed at curbing money laundering and other possible cross-border crimes. Meanwhile, South Korean officials are reportedly talking with counterparts in Japan and China to explore regulatory cooperation, which means that any final rules could be developed in tandem with those countries.  For its part, China has shown no sign of willingness to relax its own ban on initial coin offerings, which it unveiled in early September prior to South Korea's announcement.

In an article published on its website last Friday, the century-old think tank cautioned that ""there exists a very real danger that the petro will not only fail to cure Venezuela's economic woes but will also weaken the integrity of cryptocurrencies writ-large.""  Brookings' reasoning is that if the petro proves to be as worthless as the think tank's analysts expect, ""such realization and its aftermath may, unfortunately, contribute to the idea that cryptocurrencies facilitate fraud.""  Just as concerning, in Brookings' view, is that if the petro turns out to be an effective way to thwart international sanctions, other countries may feel emboldened to use the technology to get around such blockades.  ""The power of sanctions is in danger of eroding,"" the article reads, adding:  ""Other countries may feel emboldened to act more aggressively if economic sanctions can be thwarted through cryptocurrency sales.""  $5 billion in proceeds?

42401229,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcMVRX,1520875251,Crypto Miner Genesis Hit With Cease-and-Desist Order,"Cloud mining service Genesis Mining has been told to stop operating in the state of South Carolina, according to a cease-and-desist order released on March 9.  Genesis and a second firm, Swiss Gold Global Inc., were named in the orderhttp://2hsvz0l74ah31vgcm16peuy12tz.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/01621904.pdf, which says that mining contracts sold to state residents are considered securities.  The Securities Commission of South Carolina alleged that Swiss Gold Global acted as a broker-dealer for Genesis, but that it hadn't registered in the state to offer securities.  ""At all times relevant to this order, Respondent Genesis Mining continuously offered investment opportunities in Mining Contracts to South Carolina residents through its website. At no time relevant to the events stated herein was Respondent Swiss Gold Global registered with the Division as a broker-dealer, and no exemption from registration has been claimed by Respondent Swiss Gold Global.""  Through the contracts, buyers essentially purchase an amount of computing power over a period of time that is hosted elsewhere, as opposed to owning mining hardware themselves. In the Commission's view, they ""constitute investment contracts and are thus securities"" under South Carolina law.  Both firms were ordered to stop doing business in South Carolina, according to the document. Additionally, both Genesis and Swiss Gold Global were permanently barred from offering any securities in the state in the future. That said, the companies have the opportunity to a request a hearing with state officials to present their side.  The move represents the latest cryptocurrency investment-related cease-and-desist order to come out of a U.S. state regulator in recent weeks.  To date, state officials have sent orders to a number of firms, most recently the one behind a cryptocurrency endorsed by film actor Steven Seagal.

42401236,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcMVZP,1520871314,Lawyer Warns Bitfinex on 'Threats' Against Blogger,"""Bitfinex'ed,"" the pseudonymous blogger and persistent critic of cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, has hired a prominent lawyer amid a long-running battle with the controversial company.  Stephen Palley  , a partner at the Washington, D.C.-based law firm Anderson Kill, fired off a sternly worded letter Monday to Bitfinex's general counsel, Stuart Hoegner. In the letter, a copy of which was obtained by CoinDesk, Palley warned that if he finds that the exchange is behind ""threats"" that have been made against his client, ""there will be legal consequences.""  Palley wrote to Hoegner:  ""As you know, threats have been made and continue to be made against @bitfinex’ed. If we learn that your client is directly or indirectly responsible for these threats, or if any harm should take place to @bitfinex'ed as a result of these threats, there will be legal consequences.""  Palley's relationship with the pseudonymous blogger dates back to December when Bitfinex publicly threatened legal action against Bitfinex'ed. The blogger hired Palley that month but kept the engagement quiet until now.  A spokesman for Bitfinex did not respond to a request for comment by press time. When reached by CoinDesk, Palley would not elaborate on the nature of the threats, citing security concerns. But Bitfinex'ed claimed last year that someone had offered a five-figure bounty for personal information about the blogger.  More recently, after the @Bitfinexed account was briefly suspended from Twitter, the user accused Bitfinex of hiring bots to ""mass report"" its critic (a charge the exchange denied).  Bitfinex'ed has been writing critical and highly detailed posts about the exchange since August of last year. Many of the posts have focused on the relationship between Bitfinex and Tether, the issuer of USDT, a ""stablecoin"" linked to the U.S. dollar that is perhaps as controversial as the British Virgin Islands-based crypto exchange.  In the blogger's view, Tether (which has common ownership and management with Bitfinex), has been issuing more USDT than it has dollars in the bank in order to artificially inflate the price of bitcoin.  Tether had long maintained that a forthcoming audit from Friedman LLP would show that its token was fully backed. But in January, Tether said the relationship with Friedman had ended, without explaining who dumped who or why.  While the severing of ties with Friedman has fueled doubts about Tether's financials, other observers have argued that the company is limited in what it can reveal about its finances. For example, if it were to identify its banking partners, those institutions might get in hot water with regulators given the current environment.  Still, concerns linger that Tether poses a systemic risk to the broader cryptocurrency market, given USDT's prominent role as a source of liquidity.

In a statement released last week, Mariya Gabriel, European Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society, addressed concerns about the power-intensive nature of cryptocurrency mining, while clarifying the regulatory status of the industry.  Gabriel said:  “If the energy consumed for this activity is produced according to law, there is no legal basis to forbid or even limit it. ... As mining of cryptocurrency is not an illegal activity, the Commission did not put in place any means to track it, so far.”  However, as an electricity-consuming economic activity, mining is subject to EU rules regarding ""energy efficiency, the power sector and greenhouse gases emissions,"" she added.  Gabriel went on to say the European Commission would continue to review the growing impact cryptocurrencies have on energy consumption and demand.  As mentioned by the commissioner, it's not currently clear how much bitcoin mining is carried out within the EU.  Mining activity, she pointed out, is still currently concentrated in China, despite hints that regulators there may move to clamp down on the industry. ""Nevertheless, it cannot be excluded that some part of the mining is done in the EU,"" Gabriel said.  As reported by the Washington Post recently, Iceland, which generates most of its own electricity through hydroelectric power stations, now has more prospective cryptocurrency mining projects than the island’s energy supply could support. Iceland, however, is not a full EU member, but is part of the European Economic Area.  Experts told the Post that bitcoin mining alone consumes roughly 0.14 percent of the world’s generated electricity supply – a conundrum some in the blockchain industry believe creates a strong incentive for experiments with sustainable energy solutions.

As of writing, the world's fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is changing hands at $1,119 - up 3 percent on a 24-hour basis, according to data source CoinMarketCap. Prices had dropped to a four-week low of $938 on Friday, tracking the broader market sell-off.  However, over the weekend, BCH moved back above the $1,000 mark, signaling a temporary low is in place at $938.  Also, yesterday's 14 percent rise in BCH was backed by a 38 percent jump in trading volumes, as per CoinMarketCap. A high volume recovery only adds credence to the argument that a short-term bottom has been made.  1-hour chart  BCH has created a bull flag, a bullish continuation pattern, meaning an upside break would signal the continuation of the rally from the Friday's low of $914. BCH could then rise to $1,200 (psychological hurdle) and may extend gains to $1,240 - 161.8 percent Fibonacci extension.  Bullish crossover between the 50-hour MA (moving average) and 100-hour MA favors further upside in BCH prices.  That said, it is still too early to call a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change as the cryptocurrency is still stuck inside a falling channel (series of lower highs and lower lows on the price chart).  Daily chart  The previous day's bullish outside day candle adds credence to Friday's bullish hammer candle and suggests BCH will likely see an upside break of the bull flag pattern (seen in 1-hour chart) and move towards the falling channel resistance of $1,200.  View  BCH looks set to test $1,200 over the next two-three days.  A daily close (as per UTC) above $1,200 would signal the sell-off from the record highs above $4,000 has ended and the bulls have regained control.  Meanwhile, a downside break of the bull flag would neutralize the immediate bullish outlook, while a daily close (as per UTC) below $914 (Friday's low) could yield a sell-off to $758.61 (Feb. 6 low).

Although currently at a nascent stage, the plan, if approved, may spark the creation of exchange products for ethereum with an official price index reference.  “Institutional investors and commercial partners are ready for a regulated and liquid marketplace to gain exposure to and hedge these increasingly important digital currencies and commodities,"" said Sunil Hirani, founder of TrueDigital, continuing:  ""But the marketplace is sorely lacking the necessary foundation, infrastructure and platforms that institutional investors have come to expect in other important markets.”  Ether on chart image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/03/12/ether-takes-step-toward-institutional-us-trading,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a2ede87d79e36f6c50e7a905c79b3ee22727f990-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42401233,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcMVWS,1520859658,Former Docker CEO to Lead Crypto-Powered Distributed Storage Startup,"Decentralized data storage startup Storj is hoping to boost its growth with the hire of a new executive chairman and interim chief executive.  The new appointment, Ben Golub, formerly CEO at open-source software firm Docker, will oversee Storj as it continues to scale up its services, said founder Shawn Wilkinson.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Wilkinson described Golub as a “dream candidate” due to his past experience building out open-source companies, in particular.  “We came to a point where we really wanted to accelerate Storj to the next level … and push to the edge, so we thought ‘let’s bring on someone who's done this before many times,’” he explained.  Storj, which was founded in 2014, currently has 90,000 ""farmer"" nodes in 200 countries, with 69,000 registered users and more than 240 million transactions each month.  Building the decentralized storage platform is “incredibly important,” Golub said, adding “it was natural for me to get excited about Storj from a technology standpoint – open-source, decentralized storage.”  Storj's roadmap going forward involves expanding the startup’s holdings to include higher-value data, he said, adding:  “The next really big milestone for the company is the next release of the architecture. ... We’re at the exabyte scale, so there’s tons of demand from users and rapid growth in the number of farmers. We’ve got to take the next big step to make it efficient to users.”  Governance efforts  Golub said he joined Storj not only for the opportunity he saw in working with an open-source decentralized platform, but because he believes the team is capable of growing “into a world-class organization.”  Discussing the current regulatory uncertainty surrounding ICOs, he said companies need to ""do the right thing"" in order to lessen the need for strict regulations in the space.  “I think we also have to do things as companies and industry to improve transparency, to improve governance. I think we as a company are trying to be good about governance [and] explain what we’ve done with the token,” he said.  Golub also noted Storj’s decision to lock up 245 million tokens for six months as part of a move to improve clarity about the company’s timeline and introduce some stability to its token’s price.  The firm's STORJ token is currently worth $1.13, according to CoinMarketCap, and has a market cap of around $150 million.  Golub concluded:  “I was very impressed by the fact that Storj did such a large token lockup. In any kind of market knowing what volume is out there and what’s going to be used and how is going to be used in terms of creating stability and i think Storj has done a great job at that.""

In a cautionary note released on Sunday by Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM), the central bank took aim at a cryptocurrency project named Coinzer, which it says used the BNM logo and the Jata Negara, Malaysia's coat of arms, in its proposed token design, white paper and website.  A picture posted by the central bank further shows that, in addition of the logo and coat of arms, the design also incorporated the 14-pointed Star of Malaysia symbol and Malaysia's country code.  ""BNM would like to state that it does not authorize or endorse the cryptocurrency platform called Coinzer. ... Members of the public are advised to exercise caution and carefully evaluate the risks associated with investment in digital currencies,"" the central bank said in the statement.  The BNM's warning is another signal that the country's regulators are stepping up their efforts in monitoring domestic ICO projects that, through unauthorized promotion methods, may mislead domestic investors.  On Jan. 9, Malaysia's securities market watchdog, Securities Commission Malaysia (SC), issued a cease-and-desist to a startup ahead of its planned ICO.  Later that month, in a joint statement, the SC and BNM doubled down on their commitment to more closely focus on ICO projects.

42401226,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcMVOa,1520851320,Thomson Reuters Is Using Your Feelings About Bitcoin to Make Investors Rich,"How does the world feel about cryptocurrency?  Announced Monday, media giant Thomson Reuters has launched a new bitcoin data feed designed to make it easier for investors know that very answer.  Included in the latest release of the company's MarketPsych Indices product, a suite of investment tools analyzing everything from companies to sovereign bonds, the bitcoin sentiment data feed will use AI to analyze more than 400 sources of data, scouring news articles and social media posts in search of actionable insights.  Using metrics such as ""greed"" and ""fear"" both accredited an non-accredited investors can identify hedging opportunities or create buy-sell orders when a particular trait reaches a certain level or changes over a certain period of time.  And while Thomson Reuters has long tracked bitcoin prices, and last year made a push into applications of blockchain technology broadly, this week's launch marks the firm's formal entrance into products made specifically for cryptocurrency traders.  Still, Austin Burkett, the global head of Thomson Reuters quant and feeds division, acknowledged that the goal of the product is one all investors will find familiar.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Our customers can use it to generate alpha. They can drive positive investment returns. They can use it to better balance the risk in their portfolios.""  AI for investing  Stepping back, the Thomson Reuters bitcoin data feed can also be seen as part of a larger trend among companies offering AI services, one that has found them seeking to leverage their existing tools for cryptocurrency investing.  Crowd sentiment firms Santiment and Token AI, for example, have emerged to target this use case, with a number of others entering as prices have risen in recent years.  At the core of all these investment insights products, however, are programs called Bayesian filters that apply lessons originally taught to computers by humans, according to Richard Peterson, CEO of MarketPsyche, which created the underlying technology for the Thomson Reuters bitcoin feed.  In interview, Peterson, who is also the author of ""Trading on Sentiment: The Power of Minds over Markets,"" explained how sentences found online are first classified by human readers according to any number of traits, and how the computer learns over time which relationships are likely indicative of certain sentiments.  Hope and worry, he explained, can cause someone to accelerate or withdraw an investment decision, and with a bit of fine tuning, trends in digital conversations can be identified as leading or lagging investment indicators.  The machine is then taught the significance of the context of a cryptocurrency-related phrase or word. So, for example he says that ""BTC"" on Reddit likely means bitcoin, whereas the phrase in another context might mean Bellingham Technical College.  In other words, while feelings can go a long way to providing alpha in the Thomson Reuters MarketPsyche Indices, each phrase identified also has to be filtered for context, he said, adding:  ""We have to detect whether it's relevant to cryptocurrencies.""

42401240,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcMVcM,1520850005,"Bitcoin Eyes $10K, But Charts Hint at Bull Trap Potential","Bitcoin (BTC) is solidly bid on the first trading day of the week, but a move above $10,000 could turn out to be a bull trap, the technical charts indicate.  Having hit a 3.5-week low of $8,371 on Friday, bitcoin prices traded in a sideways manner in the range of $8,400 to $9,400 over the weekend, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index. As of writing, BTC is seen at $9,885, and is up 13 percent in the last 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap.  Despite the 14 percent recovery from Friday's low of $8,371, it's too early to call a bullish trend reversal, given that BTC is still down at least 18 percent from recent highs above $11,660.  Further, the price action over the weekend is indicative of short-term bear market exhaustion. For instance, on the Bitfinex exchange, bitcoin closed (as per UTC) below the 200-day moving average (MA) on Saturday for the first time since Feb. 5.  Daily chart  However, despite the bearish daily close, BTC avoided a break below Friday's low of $8,342 and actually ended up creating a bullish ""outside day"" candle on Sunday. Prices also closed (as per UTC) above the 200-day MA.  A bullish outside day candle occurs when the candle has a higher high and a lower low than the previous day's candle, indicating that the bulls have taken over from the bears.  Also, the symmetrical triangle breakout seen on the 1-hour chart below supports the idea of short-term bear market exhaustion.  1-hour chart  The above chart (prices as per Bitfinex) shows:  An upside break of the triangle pattern adds credence to the bullish outside day candle (seen on the daily chart) and indicates scope for a rally to $10,134 (10-day MA) and $10,371 (weekly 10-MA).  The 50-hour MA and 100-hour MA have bottomed out (shed bearish bias).  Over the last 14 hours, BTC seems to have formed a base around $9,400, possibly indicating the foundations of the next step higher towards $10,000 have been built.  However, the setup on the weekly chart indicates the rally to $10,000–$10,300 could turn out to be a bull trap.  Weekly chart  The above chart (prices as per Bitfinex)-  BTC created a bearish ""outside-week"" candle – i.e. last week's high and low overshadowed the price action of the previous week – indicating the rally from the Feb. 6 low of $6,000 has ended at $11,700 and the bears have regained control.  The 10-week MA is trending lower, indicating bearish setup.  The relative strength index (RSI) failed to beat the resistance at 53.00–55.00 and has rolled over in favor of the bears.  View  The hourly chart favors a rally to $10,000–$10,300. A daily close (as per UTC) above the 10-day MA (seen today at $10,134) would confirm a bullish outside day reversal and open doors for re-test of $10,980–$11,000. However, the gains will likely be transient as suggested by the weekly chart.  Meanwhile, a break below last week's low of $8,342 would open doors for re-test of monthly 50-MA, currently located at $6,339.  Only a weekly close above $11,700 would signal a bullish reversal and shift attention to $17,000.

42401221,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcMVKe,1520847013,Japan's SBI Group Scraps Huobi Crypto Exchange Partnership,"SBI Holdings, the investment arm of Japanese financial giant SBI Group, has canceled a business partnership with Chinese cryptocurrency startup Huobi Group.  In an announcement released Friday, SBI Holdings said it has decided to halt the business collaboration with Huobi for the launch two cryptocurrency exchanges in Japan.  As reported by CoinDesk, the two firms first struck the deal in December 2017 to combine efforts for the new Huobi Japan and SBI Virtual Currency exchanges.  The latter exchange had already completed business registration with Japan's regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA), in September 2017. Huobi Group had indicated that the platforms were expected to begin operations this month.  Yet, in the latest announcement, SBI Holdings said it has scrapped its original plan to use Huobi's technology, know-how and human resources in operating the exchanges, and instead has decided to bring the efforts in-house.  In explaining the reasons for canceling the deal, SBI Holdings said the firm needs a system that incorporates higher levels of security and which can respond promptly to domestic and overseas regulations.  As such, according to the statement, SBI Holdings will now utilize SBI Group's own resources to build a system with enhanced security and sufficient processing capacity.  The decision comes at a time when the FSA is beefing up its efforts in scrutinizing Japanese exchanges regarding security measures, following the hack of some $530 million-worth of the NEM cryptocurrency from the Coincheck exchange in January.  Just last week, the FSA issued administrative penalties to several domestic platforms deemed reckless by the agency, having allegedly provided insufficient security measures to fully protect investors.  The news also follows a Feb. 28 announcement by SBI, saying it had postponed the live launch of SBI Virtual Currency citing the need for further security enhancements.  At press time, Huobi Group had not responded to CoinDesk's inquiries for comments on its plan to further pursue the Huobi Japan effort.

42401241,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcMVdL,1520841639,Why the 'Worst' Crypto Networks Will Be The Biggest,"Taylor Pearson is the author of ""The End of Jobs"" and writes about entrepreneurship and blockchain technologies at TaylorPearson.me.      Though crypto networks are often compared to private firms, a better analogy is to compare them to cities.  Like a city, a crypto network is a community of loosely affiliated individuals who agree on a set of rules for how they live and work – laws for cities, protocols for crypto networks.  Unlike firms, cities and crypto networks are organized from the bottom up rather than the top down.  Individual leaders matter more for firms than cities. Who the CEO of a firm is plays a major role in an investment decision, whereas who the mayor of a city is plays little role in a person’s choice to move there. Many bitcoin investors can not name a single core developer, but that plays little role in the investment decision.  The growth of firms tends to slow down as they get larger, but the growth of cities tends to speed up even as the population increases because of network effects. The 18 million people already living in New York are ""a feature, not a bug.""  The same is true of crypto networks; the larger and more robust the community, the more valuable the crypto network.  This analogy is important because the way you architect a successful city and the way you architect a successful firm are very different.  If we take the lessons of how to build successful firms and apply them to build crypto networks, it will end in failure. We must study not how successful firms are built, but how successful cities are built and apply those lessons to crypto networks.  Bitcoin is worse is better  In his essay Bitcoin-is-Worse-is-Better, early bitcoin researcher Gwern argues:  ""Bitcoin's long gestation and early opposition indicates it is an example of the 'worse is better' paradigm in which an ugly complex design with few attractive theoretical properties compared to purer competitors nevertheless successfully takes over.""  From a network design perspective, bitcoin is ugly and inelegant.  It’s ugly and inelegant because the network’s security depends solely on having more brute-force computing power than your opponents. It’s ugly and inelegant because the hash tree never stops growing.  And what’s with the arbitrary 21 million bitcoin limit? Couldn’t it have been a rounder number or a power of 2?  Lessons from Brasilia  The ""Worse is Better"" paradigm was also studied by Yale Professor James C. Scott in his book ""Seeing Like a State.""  In his book, Scott asked why so many utopian schemes had failed miserably in the twentieth century. One of the primary areas he studied was the construction of cities, and in particular he compared Paris with Brazil’s new capital, Brasilia, which was built from scratch in the 1950s.  The architects and city planners in charge of the project believed they could design Brasilia to be the perfect city.  Unlike working with an existing city where they felt encumbered by existing infrastructure, they had a completely blank slate without the baggage that encumbered existing cities like Paris.  If you look at a map of a major city like Paris, it looks, well, ugly and inelegant.  On a map, Brasilia has a look of beauty and elegance. Straight roads and geometric buildings are interspersed with equally geometric parks.  It is the pinnacle of what Scott calls “high modernism,” the desire to make a city aesthetically pleasing from the perspective of a central planner.  And yet, the neatly ordered plan in Brasilia vs. the messy evolved reality in Paris makes the lived experience of Brasilia feels soulless and empty while Paris feels vibrant and rich.  From a central planner perspective, Paris is a mess with apartments on top of stores and factories, while Brasilia is neatly ordered with separate residential and commercial areas.  Yet, which of these two cities would you rather live in?  Scott observed that the most popular cities (NYC, Paris, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Sao Paulo, and London to name a few) tend to look ugly and inelegant from the top-down, high modernist point of view. They should be worse, yet, they are more popular.  Though Brasilia looks beautiful and elegant on a map, the result in the words of one resident is that “the city center feels markedly devoid of life in plazas, where the pigeons far outnumber the people.” From the planner’s perspective, it should be better, yet, it’s less popular and worse.  Similar to the best crypto networks, the best cities where people want to live are compelling from a bottom-up perspective, not a top-down one. Despite their unsightly appearance on a map, people actually want to live there and so the cities continue to grow and thrive.  In the case of cities, the high-modernist, central planners exhibited a common failure pattern:  A well-meaning planner comes in and looks at a complex reality from the top-down.  They don’t understand how it works because it’s complex and messy. Like the map of Paris, it’s hard to understand from the outside looking in.  Rather than trying to understand why the city looks like a mess and whether it’s serving some deeper purpose, they attribute it to the city planning being “irrational.”  They come up with an idealized map of what a perfect city should look like in theory.  They use their power to impose that idealized map on the actual city and it turns into a disaster.  The planners ignored Gall's Law:  ""A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system.""  Both bitcoin and Paris follow Gall’s Law. They evolved from simple systems. These systems, in their now-complex form, may make no sense and look like a complete mess from the top down.  In the same way that it’s difficult to explain what’s so compelling about cities like Paris, London or Hong Kong, it’s difficult to explain what’s so compelling about bitcoin to someone who has never used it. In both cases, you have to experience it from a bottom-up perspective to understand.  These characteristics are essential properties of any long-lasting complex system, be it a city, a crypto network, or a rainforest.  Most new crypto projects will fail for the same reasons Brasilia did.  If crypto networks are like cities,then many of the projects being launched now are being approached from the same top down, high modernist perspective as the central planners approach Brasilia and will end up equally devoid of life and communities.  These projects have a premise amounting to “bitcoin is so ugly or inelegant at doing X, so we’ve fixed it to look all nice and pretty in this white paper”  These arguments are similar to the ones which city planners made arguing that “Paris looks like such a mess on the map, I’ve designed Brasilia to look all nice and pretty on this map.""  These crypto networks will have a familiar failure pattern:  A well-meaning protocol designer comes in and looks at a complex reality.  They don’t understand how it works because it’s complex and messy.  Rather than trying to understand why it looks like a mess and whether that is serving some deeper purpose, they attribute it to the current design being “irrational, ugly and inelegant”  They come up with an idealized protocol design which makes sense on paper  After the initial marketing hype and buzz fades away, the protocols users and community don’t like “living there” and slowly migrate away.  Many of these projects have raised large amounts of money because, like Brasilia, they look well designed and thought out on paper.  However, the crypto networks that will survive in the long term will be the ones that evolve gradually with a deep understanding of the projects which came before them. They will start simply and evolve over time, integrating their community of developers, users, investors and miners.  A complex crypto network designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple crypto network and build from there.

42401255,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcMVTV,1520841627,"Coincheck Starts Crypto Hack Refunds, Allows Limited Trading","Japanese exchange Coincheck is today starting to reimburse victims who lost funds in a hack that saw around $530 million stolen from the platform in January.  In a blog post dated Mar. 12, Coincheck said it will refund users at the rate of 88.549 Japanese yen (or $0.83) per NEM token stolen – the same amount as stated in its initial compensation plan – to the accounts of customers who held the token at the close of Jan. 26, Japan time.  As reported before, Coincheck first confirmed the hack on Jan. 26, confessing that around 523 million tokens had been stolen. Based on the compensation plan, users will see a combined payout of $420 million.  Today's update follows the company's press conference last Thursday at which its CEO and COO announced compensation will start this week, in response to several class action lawsuits and a months-long probe by Japan's financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA), over the firm's financial capacity to issue the refunds.  In addition, Coincheck also announced today that it is restarting withdrawals, as well as trading of several cryptocurrencies, including ETH, ETC, XRP, LTC, BCH and BTC. The exchange further stated that it will take more time to resume services for other assets.  While the company tries to get its business functioning back to normal, another report today indicates that Coincheck may have been compromised weeks before the heist happened.  According to Nikkei Asia Review, the cause of the breach, as identified by Coincheck previously, was a form of malware that had infected the company's internal computer systems.  The new report, citing anonymous sources close to the police's investigation, said hackers had first sent phishing emails to Coincheck employees in early January, which then injected the virus after links had been clicked by staff.  Subsequently, the report said, the hackers were able to gather private keys to large amounts of NEM weeks before the actual heist, during which time Coincheck had no proper tools to detect such communication between itself and external servers.  The perceived lack of security measures also sparked the FSA's probe into the company's system. With a second administrative penalty having been issued by the agency, Coincheck is also required to submit a written plan by Mar. 22 for its plans for system improvements.

42401234,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcMVVT,1520834444,Monero Mining Malware Attack Linked to Egyptian Telecom Giant,"Unidentified entities at a telecom company connected to the Egyptian government are using malware to trick Middle Eastern Web users into unwittingly mining monero, according to a new report.  Internet users in Turkey and Syria who downloaded Windows applications such as Avast Antivirus, CCleaner, Opera, or 7-Zip were unknowingly redirected to malicious versions with malware, the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab claimed in a study published Friday.  The report  – which calls this scheme ""AdHose – explained:  ""We found that a series of middleboxes on Türk Telekom's network were being used to redirect hundreds of users attempting to download certain legitimate programs to versions of those programs bundled with spyware....We found similar middleboxes at a Telecom Egypt demarcation point. The middleboxes were being used to redirect users across dozens of ISPs to affiliate ads and browser cryptocurrency mining scripts.""  Telecom Egypt  is a major state-owned telecommunications company, and the middleboxes in question include Sandvine PacketLogic devices, which have been associated with government surveillance in Turkey and Syria. The researchers' regional network sweep in January found 5,700 devices affected by AdHose.  When reached for comment, Sandvine pushed back against the report's findings, telling CoinDesk:  ""Based on a preliminary review of the report, certain Citizen Lab allegations are technically inaccurate and intentionally misleading....We have never had, directly or indirectly, any commercial or technology relationship with any known malware vendors, and our products do not and cannot inject malicious software. While our products include a redirection feature, HTTP redirection is a commodity-like technology that is commonly included in many types of technology products.""  The spokesperson also said that an investigation into the allegations is being undertaken because the company is ""deeply committed to ethical technology development.""  The idea of cryptocurrency-fueled government spyware may seem far-fetched. However, researchers involved with the Tor Project’s Open Observatory of Network Interference noted a similar malware epidemic – minus the cryptocurrency mining element – in 2016.

42401227,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcMVQY,1520829042,Ponzis and Death: The Stranger Ways to Lose Crypto,"Bitcoin Ponzi scams are raking in millions – all without much effort.  That may be self-explanatory to those who traffic the social media forums where the subject is discussed, but to researchers, it's also a fertile ground for new findings. For them, someone asking for money and promising 100x returns isn't simply a nuisance, they're an opportunity for study.  Indeed, the Financial Crypto 2018 conference in Curacao last week delved deep into the many ways these scams are propagating and why some have been so much more successful than others.  University of New Mexico assistant professor Marie Vasek looked through nearly 2,000 scams, revealing research that hinted at the sheer variety seeking crypto gains. Some, she said, last for ages until the hoax is found out, others come and vanish overnight, all without much interest.  By looking at the scams and how long each lasted – what they called the scam's ""time of death"" – Vasek shed light on what works the best for scammers, typically launching their scams on popular and reputable bitcoin forums, such as Bitcoin Talk.  The gist? The most long-lasting scams are those where the scammers engage with the community the most and have a thriving community of commenters.  Vasek told attendees:  ""Small cores of about five people that are very good at doing this. You see this in our other paper. One will die and another appears.""  Attracting victims, like flies to a light, is as easy as acting as if the scam has tons of attention, she said. To this end, about 30 percent of scam threads have posts from shills, or those that the scammers pay to post positive things about the scam, according to Vasek's analysis.  But there's no shortage of strange ways users can lose money in the cryptocurrency Wild West. As such, computer researchers in Curacao looked at some of the stranger ways as well.  Dead or not?  Another report from researcher group IC3 explored how death can cause problems for users who are trying to secure their cryptocurrencies.  As an example, the researchers highlighted multi-signature wallets, a variation on the tool that aims to add security by giving multiple users the ability to sign and spend funds. That way, if one private key is compromised by an attacker or otherwise, they can't do anything.  But these protections are a double-edged sword. If one participant in a 2-of-2 multi-signature setup dies or disappears, the funds will then be unspendable and lost forever.  The easiest way to mitigate the issue would be to introduce some entity that is trusted to declare whether Bob dies or not, Cornell University computer science researcher Fan Zhang argued. But with cryptocurrencies, the whole idea is to prevent a single point of failure, such as one that accidentally declares Bob dead, when he isn't really.  ""Of course, we don't want to trust anyone. So, how do we realize this without trusted third party? And how do we prove if Bob has been hit by the bus or that a key is permanently unusable?"" Zhang said.  That's the question the group of IC3 researchers in work they call ""paralysis proofs,"" which aims to ""prove"" that one person involved in the multi-signature setup can no longer participate, whether one of them died or simply lost their private key.  There are a couple of ways they can do this. With ethereum it's straightforward. But with bitcoin, Zhang suggested the easiest way to prove a user can't participate in a multi-signature transaction would be to bring in trusted hardware, located in some computers, into the mix.  In short, the trusted hardware sends out ""life signals"" to a participant who is suspected to have lost their key or might be dead. If the participant doesn't respond to the signal in a timely manner, then his or her key is no longer required to spend the funds.  Sounds all well and good, but one audience member pointed out one possible flaws. ""You could get the money by killing Bob,"" he said. This isn't as cheeky of a concern as you might think since security experts often think about these kinds of attack scenarios.  IC3 researcher Fen agreed, saying, ""If you can kill Bob, all bets are off. Killing Bob is a whole different story.""  Whether this is a real vulnerability or not, the problem they're trying to fix is indeed on researchers' minds right now. So, there are other proposed solutions, such as adding a timelock to a multi-signature transaction so it can be spent after it goes unused for a certain amount of time.  'Hostile takeovers'  Another researcher, New York University's Joseph Bonneau, looked at how much it would cost to execute perhaps the most infamous of blockchain attacks, a ""51% attack,"" where one entity controls so much of the mining capacity, it can begin to bend (or break) the rules of the system.  The primary retort from cryptocurrency supporters is that this would not be in the attacker's self-interest, because attacking the network requires you to spend millions or billions to buy up mining equipment. And, once they do all that, they won't be able to make all that much money from it.  But, in new research, Bonneau explores how much it would be to launch such an attack anyway, for someone who's not expecting profit.  ""If there's a villain out there like [character Auric] Goldfinger from the James Bond movies with no intrinsic motivation, how expensive would a blockchain be to kill?"" he asked.  Bonneau explained that there are different ways of buying up the necessary power to disrupt the network, varying from blockchain to blockchain.  He started with the easiest to execute. Rather than buying a thousands of mining computers and wiring them up, a lazier attacker can launch a ""rent"" attack by buying power online using a cloud platform such as Amazon Web Services with a click of a few buttons.  Since it's possible to rent GPUs, the power underpinning ethereum, but not ASICs, the hardware securing bitcoin, this is an attack that affects ethereum, but not bitcoin. ""It would take about $2 million an hour to attack ethereum,"" Bonneau stated.  Meanwhile, if an malicious attacker were to instead launch what Bonneau calls a ""build"" attack, that's where a malicious attacker actually buys up enough physical mining hardware to control the network.  As you might have gathered, buying hardware is more expensive than temporarily renting it. Bonneau estimates it would take roughly $1.5 billion an hour to execute such an attack on either bitcoin or ethereum.  All that said, Bonneau argues his back-of-the-napkin analysis isn't completely accurate. ""People argued with me up or down on Twitter. But I would argue the exact number doesn't matter, the order of magnitude does,"" Bonneau said, adding that there's ""a lot left to model"" and ""we need more detailed analysis.""  Bonneau implied, though, that with the estimates he's made for now, these attacks might be too cheap and easy. ""Is this enough for an $80 billion system?"" he asked in an open question to the audience.  If more and more people begin to use this form of online currency, this attack vector might grow on people's minds, he argued, concluding the presentation with a prediction:  ""I think there will be more fear that this will happen in the future.""

42428668,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL9qHh,1520824503,Former Thai Finance Minister Calls for Crypto Regulation,"A former finance minister of Thailand has voiced his support for new regulations around cryptocurrency trading and initial coin offerings (ICOs).  Korn Chatikavanij previously served as the country's finance minister between the end of 2008 and mid-2011. Now chairman of The Thai Fintech Association, a startup accelerator, he said in an interview last week that his organization supports the Thailand Securities and Exchange Commission's plan to introduce dedicated rules for activities around the tech.  ""I agree with the Finance Ministry's [view] of letting the SEC be the only organization governing digital assets, because it already oversees securities and has a profound understanding of digital assets,"" said Korn, according to a Friday report by the Bangkok Post.  His comments came after a months-long public consultation period that was extended twice past its original completion date of January 22nd. One possible outcome of the review process is a plan to apply existing ""investment participation"" rules to token sales, which would impose capital requirements on those conducting ICOs within Thailand.  Following the completion of the public consultation period and a joint meeting with government officials last Wednesday, state agencies in Thailand indicated they have agreed to enact a regulatory framework on cryptocurrencies and ICOs within the next month, per the Post.  Officials have suggested such a timeline in past comments to the media, including deputy prime minister Somkid Jatusripitak, who said in mid-February that new rules should be expected in the coming weeks.
