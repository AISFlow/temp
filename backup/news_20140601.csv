42394599,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwDTjl,1401645903,Understanding Bitcoin Price Charts,"Whether you already own bitcoin or plan to get some, sooner or later you’ll want to know how much the cryptocoins are worth when converted to your currency of choice.  Later, you may want to know whether to hang onto your coins or to sell them – hopefully making a little profit in the process. However, analyzing price charts and understanding trading terms from the financial world can be rather daunting, especially for the beginner.  This guide serves as a useful primer of the basics.  What is bitcoin’s current price?  The best place to find out the latest price of bitcoin (currency symbol: BTC or XBT) is the exchange you bought them from (Bitstamp, Bitfinex and BTC-e being the most popular exchanges at the moment), or Coindesk’s own Bitcoin Price Index.  Knowing bitcoin’s current price is one thing, but pretty soon you’ll want to know where prices will go in the future.  Methods for predicting price trends  Forecasting price movements of anything traded at an exchange is a risky probabilities game – nobody is right all the time. Many traders have lost lots of money, if not their life savings, into such attempts.  The two main approaches to predicting price development are called fundamental analysis and technical analysis. While fundamental analysis examines the underlying forces of an economy, a company or a security, technical analysis attempts to forecast the direction of prices based on past market data, primarily historical prices and volumes found on price charts.  Where to find bitcoin price charts  To perform technical analysis on bitcoin price and volume history, you’ll need bitcoin price charts that display data in a more readable manner than just plain number tables. Good places to start are the charts on Coindesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.  To start with: a simple price chart  The most basic type of price chart displays prices as a line:  Closing prices of any given period of time (a month, a week, a day, one hour, etc) are used to draw the price line. This kind of chart can be used to get a quick overview of what prices have been doing lately, but traders need more data to draw their conclusions.  Trader’s choice: the candlestick chart  The most widespread type of chart among traders is the candlestick price chart, as seen below:  Candlestick charts display more data than just the closing price: each 'candle' shows the opening price, the lowest and highest price of the given time-period as well as the closing price.  In addition, the color of the candle body indicates whether the closing price was higher than the opening price (usually a green bar, called an 'up-bar’) or lower than the opening price (usually with a red body, called a 'down-bar’).  The candlestick chart belongs to the family of OHLC (open high, low close) price charts, but there’s a multitude of other chart types/styles to suit any advanced trader’s preference.  Another type worth mentioning is the non-time based (NTB) range chart. Beginners may find them less intuitive and more difficult to grasp, however.  Candlestick price charts contain a lot of useful information for the skilled trader’s eyes, such as whether a candle’s spread is wide or narrow (illustrates the difference between high and low prices), where the closing price is relative to the high and low etc.  Together with the patterns that groups of candlesticks form, this is what traders base their trend biases on: either bullish (rising prices), bearish (falling prices) or ranging sideways.  Some popular platforms with many of these features are Bitcoinity, Bitcoin Wisdom, Zeroblock and TradeBlock.  Where to go from here  Now that you’ve had an introduction to reading (bitcoin) price charts, a good idea would be to start following bitcoin’s price development on a daily basis. You will inevitably start noticing certain regularities on the charts – most probably the trending behavior of prices. Later on you might remember that this was the point in time where you were drawn into the art of technical price analysis.  This guide was contributed by Chris Cronimund.

42397678,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDjQU,1401628843,Bitcoin Crowdfunder Aims to Sponsor Formula Masters Driver,"Another effort aims to win hearts and minds for digital currencies through motor sports, with a crowdfunding campaign to sponsor Hong Kong-based British Formula Masters driver Dan Wells.  This follows the bitcoin/Diamond Circle branding of Isle of Man TT superbike rider David Johnson in last week's event, and the recent dogecoin NASCAR sponsorship that proved the concept could be successful.  If all goes well this time, the bitcoin logo on Wells' livery will debut at his race on 18th July race in South Korea.  Wells, 23, has been adept at using technology and social media to build his career and keep fans updated, with an active blog and Facebook page as well as over 16,500 posts on his @danwellsracing Twitter account.  He has also launched previous successful crowdfunding campaigns on GoFundMe in the past, raising over €14,000 from over 150 supporters. This is his first foray into bitcoin.  Passion for racing and economics  Wells said bitcoin holds promise for up-and-coming sportspeople to find sponsorship and connect with fans:  ""This partnership is exciting and innovative and I am delighted to add bitcoin as another method for sponsors and investors to invest and support my career in motorsport ... Before my racing career, one of my passions was economics so this has always been an interest and it is great to be involved in such an innovative project ... Both my race car and bitcoin are technology based and therefore I welcome the opportunity provided by David Shin of CryptoMex to be associated with the bitcoin community"".  CryptoMex.io  Bitcoin crowdfunding platform CryptoMex is managing the new Formula Masters initiative in cooperation with Wells' own company Dan Wells Investors.  CryptoMex, also based in Hong Kong, allows companies seeking financing to raise bitcoin through an offering process.  In addition, the company wants to be the gateway that bridges the large pool of backers – the 'crowd' – and entrepreneurs from East and West, particularly in strategic locations like Europe, the US and China.  David Shin, CryptoMex founder, added:  ""I am delighted that Dan Wells will be promoting bitcoin and www.CryptoMex.io. He is a testament to the innovation, hard work, and ingenuity that provides new opportunities in this world, and we look forward to working together in the motorsport and business community to develop this platform to greater heights ... I am sure it will be a winning season for Dan Wells and his backers both on track and off.""  Crowdfunding for companies  As well as crowdfunding, CryptoMex has its own kind of share market, where backers can receive 'Profit Units' in companies or projects they support, that pay rewards in bitcoin depending on success and can be traded.  Since Wells' fundraiser is donation-based rather than a profit-seeking business, however, CryptoMex is disabling the profit unit trading function this time.  The new bitcoin-based campaign contributors can choose to buy 'units' on CryptoMex or simply donate to a bitcoin address, should they not wish to register an account with the platform.  Wells will also include the address on his own homepage.

42397679,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDjRT,1401624039,Cash-Strapped MultiBit Developers to Charge Transaction Fee,"MultiBit is one of the unsung heroes of the bitcoin world. The desktop bitcoin wallet software, launched three years ago, recently surpassed 1.5 million downloads and, in fact, Gary Rowe, one of two core developers on the project, puts the estimate at more like 1.8 million this month.  Now he and development partner Jim Burton are about to start charging tiny fees for using it.  One of the things that must have helped MultiBit a lot was being listed on bitcoin.org. The wallet is one of five desktop wallets listed on that site, and is outpacing at least some of them.  CoinDesk reached out to the bitcoin core development team to ask how many people have downloaded BitcoinQT, the reference implementation of the bitcoin client, but received no response. Electrum, one of the other five wallets, also failed to respond.  What we do know is that Blockchain, the downloadable mobile wallet that also has an online counterpart, has just over 1.6 million users. This chart shows the market increase in downloads since December, after the price of bitcoin spiked.  Coinbase  's online wallet has also garnered 1.2 million users as of April, according to data from the company and isn’t the only wallet to see a recent jump in downloads.  Another veteran wallet, Armory, has had about 200,000 downloads in total since its first alpha release in early 2012, according to its core developer, Alan Reiner. The download rate has increased substantially of late, with half of that figure coming in the last six months, giving around 17,000 downloads each month on average since November.  “We get 70-85% of our downloads from bitcoin.org, by being featured on the ‘Choose your wallet’ page,” said Reiner.  Mac-based wallet Hive is doing very well, with 125,000 downloads thus far (most of which come from this site, according to the founder, Wendell Davis).  While Hive came out of beta in February, it was first launched for download in November. At that rate, it received around 21,000 downloads per month on average since its beta launch – around 40% of Multibit’s average, if we also average MultiBit download numbers over its entire existence.  ""We expect mobile numbers to eclipse fairly quickly once we get rolling,"" said Davis, whose firm bought Android app Bridgewalker last November.  Dealing with growth  However, with 1.8 million downloads to date, the MultiBit project could be described as a victim of its own success. The more users that download a project, the more support calls start coming in.  “Back in October and November, we were getting 20,000 downloads a day, when the price was going bananas,” Rowe said. “What we found there was that lots of people were asking us questions, but it was the same thing, over and over again.”  The duo updated the website with support articles that had previously languished within the issues database. It also includes a basic HTML browser in the product itself, so that they can serve up help files.  “We had to introduce a few little hurdles that people would go through. If we introduced a 'help' email at the top of the support page, we’d be inundated,” he says. Those hurdles include setting up github accounts.  “Every single little hurdle that they go through stops them just that little bit, so that either they give up, or the issue is so strong, that it has to be dealt with.”  User complaints  Then, there’s the occasional bug that blows up. That happened last month, when a firestorm erupted on reddit, after a user alleged that the firm’s wallet had eaten one of his private keys, depriving him of his coins.  That user – who has since stopped answering messages from CoinDesk, and hasn’t appeared on reddit since – caused a flurry of criticism on other boards, with users accusing the developers of scamming users.  The answer to that technical problem on the forum, from Burton, where he talked about problems getting his lights working seemed to inflame users even more. The post showed an underlying frustration common to developers on any free software project: they are resource-constrained.  Eventually, the two developers just threw out the code responsible for that complaint, rather than trying to fix it. Mike Hearn, the developer of bitcoinj, the software library underpinning MultiBit, came on board to help and the team removed a feature that enabled users to import private key data from Blockchain.  “We just thought it’s better that we take it out entirely even though it is possible to fix it, because that introduces more stability, because there are fewer things to go wrong,” said Rowe, who added that, because of this issue, the pair lost around two weeks of development time on the next version of the wallet.  MultiBit HD  Hopefully, cases of lost private keys won’t occur when that next version appears. The software will use Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) technology, meaning the wallet uses a data structure that lets you produce large numbers of private keys from a tree of data.  The whole tree can be encoded in human readable form, simply by entering a passphrase. That tree, along with all of its addresses, can later be reproduced with the words, even without connecting to the Internet.  “Let’s say that disaster strikes and your laptop drops in a canal,” said Rowe. “So, you reach into the firesafe, pull out the paper, download MultiBit onto your new laptop, type in the 12 words, and off you go.”  The company will also include strong encryption technology into the HD version of the MultiBit wallet, enabling users to back it up to the cloud if they want to.  Other features in the pipeline include integration with the recently introduced bitcoin payment protocol, which has already been adopted by BitPay and Coinbase. And MultiBit is working with the creators of the Trezor hardware wallet to integrate with them too. This would put secure signing capabilities in a piece of hardware.  “At present bitcoinj isn’t 100% Trezor compatible,” Rowe said. “To get it fully integrated will take a bit of time.”  Constrained resources  Time is the problem. Redditors may grumble occasionally about problems with the wallet, but the issue is that these two are working on the project almost single-handedly.  [post-quote]  Rowe has a day job doing IT contract work, and while he has been able to take several months off to work on MultiBit, he has to spend some of the summer back in normal contract development, meaning that his work will be restricted to evenings and weekends.  Jim Burton, the other developer working full-time on the project, will also have a hiatus this summer.  Part of the problem is that there aren’t many people working on the wallet. The github page shows just eight contributors. And that's by design.  “Never before have we had an open-source library that anyone can download, that enables anyone to send money anywhere in the world,” Rowe explained. “That has to be protected.”  “The code that depends on it has to be robust and the transitive dependency chain has to be robust as well. All the code we rely on in the open-source world, we have to know that it doesn’t contain wallet-stealing code.”  Hence the team is very conservative about giving anyone commit access.  This approach causes a bottleneck, though. MultiBit has been taking donations, but has received around 50 bitcoins since the start of 2012. That’s 1.8 bitcoins a month. Enough to keep Rowe and Burton in pizza and beer for coding sessions, certainly, but hardly a coder’s salary.  A new way of charging  They’ve been hoping for a large donor to come along and drop $200,000 in their lap, but as this doesn’t seem likely, they’ve decided to take another approach, which they’re calling the Burton-Rowe Income Technique (BRIT).  The wallet will in future charge 1,000 satoshis per spend. That’s about half a cent at today’s price. Put another way, said Rowe, 800 bitcoin transactions made through MultiBit will earn the developers a latte.  If MultiBit becomes popular, and they get excess funds from the charges, the grand plan is to push some of that money on to other code libraries on which it relies. What isn’t yet clear is what would constitute an excess, or how that money would be allocated.  Will users baulk at the idea? Rowe said he hopes not.  “That’s such a speck of dust that the vast majority won’t even notice it,” he said. Indeed, this is below the official dust threshold, meaning that the wallet has to wait for a user to make several transactions before it can bundle them up and send the developers an amount. ""But to us, because we’re able to aggregate that tiny fee, that gives us enough money to sustain development.”  So, MultiBit will charge 0.5 cents per transaction at today's prices. It would seem harsh for users to complain. After all, they’re getting a free, long-established wallet, created by two developers, for the love of the project. It’s an interesting experiment. The question is, will you download it?

42397672,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDjKa,1401620719,To The Moon: The Top 5 Dogecoin Videos,"It goes without saying that the dogecoin community is a diverse collection of Internet denizens, mining geeks and pretty much everyone in between.  The altcoin, inspired by the love-it-or-hate-it internet meme, has gone on to form the basis for a variety of digital artworks, including a series of energetic and, at times, strange videos.  But you might be asking yourself, which video is the best? There’s only one way to find out: watching some of the best-known videos and seeing which one stands among the rest. CoinDesk has taken the liberty of reviewing five of YouTube’s best dogecoin videos, so sit back and enjoy the ride (to the moon, perhaps).  Ð is for Ðogecoin  Winner of the Dogecoin Hype Video Competition, held in February of this year, “Ð is for Ðogecoin” sports a snazzy soundtrack and eye-catching visuals that speak to the video’s impressive production quality.  The video netted its creator more than 370,000 DOGE, winning by a significant margin at the time, and featured the song “To The Moon” by artist Dunderpatrullen.  The video opens with the internet’s beloved shiba inu watching several news reports as it works on the coding for dogecoin. Once complete, the shiba launches – literally, on a rocket – into the cryptocurrency ecosystem with a kaleidoscopic ride through the coin’s rise to prominence.  Notable scenes include several miner’s cap-wearing shibas using GPUs to mine dogecoins before the aforementioned rocket takes off into orbit. Right before the video ends, we see the reddit alien waving as the doge-rocket ascends toward the moon.  Number of YouTube views: 344,422  dogecoin.avi  The unabashedly named “dogecoin.avi” scored second place in the Dogecoin Hype Video Competition, and like that contest’s first-place winner, promotes dogecoin’s early history while looking ahead to its hoped-for ascension to “the moon”.  “dogecoin.avi” opens by addressing some of the criticisms levied against dogecoin since its inception. The maker of the video chose the theme song for the Japanese anime “Gurren Lagann”, the strangely titled “Row Row Fight The Power”.  As can be expected, this doge-focused video includes plenty of moon launch imagery. Superimposed over images of rockets flying are rising price charts. US President Barack Obama makes an appearance, shown saluting the dogecoin rocket as it makes its way to the moon.  The video, which scored the maker just under 125,000 DOGE in the video contest, closes with a reenactment of the Apollo 11 moon landing (by using footage from the film Transformers: Dark of the Moon) and a general call for donations in the dogecoin community.  Number of YouTube views: 201,829  Dogecoin Kiss    If there’s one thing that shibes love to do, it’s expressing their love for dogecoin. “Dogecoin Kiss: An original song about the world’s friendliest Cryptocurrency”, by singer-songwriter Katie Pham, celebrates the fun-loving nature of the dogecoin community.      As the lyrics say:      “What does it mean to be a shibe      Just listen up and I’ll show you soon    We’re little pups and we’re big believers    In a voyage straight to the moon.”      The song’s catchy melody speaks to the easy-go nature of your average shibe, whether they’re a casual owner or a full-time miner.      At the end of the song, she touches on the way that dogecoin has become a means of expressing thanks and appreciation, singing:      “Community      Yeah its a place to be    If I can’t send a hug through this    I’ll blow a little dogecoin kiss.”      ""Dogecoin Kiss"" won third place in the Doge Hype Video Competition, earning Pham roughly 65,000 DOGE.      Number of YouTube views: 4,226    Tyrone explains dogecoin    It's a virtual fact that members of the dogecoin community are passionate about what they love. For one fan, the alternative digital currencies embodies the spirit of community itself.      In the video, a man named Tyrone explains simply:      ""What is dogecoin? It is internet money that can spread love and fly to the moon. It is currency that empowers people, not banks. Doge is love, doge is life.""              He goes on to suggest that dogecoin will one day become ""digital currency number one."" Tyrone also offers a simple explanation of the mining process, as well as clarifying the correct pronunciation of dogecoin.      The speaker, who goes by the handle Greatgigsguy3 on online low-cost marketplace Fiverr, charged $5 for his statement.      Tyrone predicts that a single dogecoin will be worth US$1 by August, or six months after the video was released. At press time, one DOGE was worth approximately US$0.0004.      Number of YouTube views: 20,215    Doge-Powered Airport Invasion Party!    Have you ever wondered what it would look like if a rowdy crowd of dogecoin-loving party-goers decided to descend on an international airport? With this video, your prayers are answered.      Organizers Tom and Gary, according to the video, led a diverse crowd for an ""decentralized dance party"" at Vancouver International Airport on New Year's Eve 2013. In addition to fun, balloons, music and dancing, the organizers made it possible for people to transmit bitcoin donations between party-goers through the use of wearable QR codes.      According to the video, the party had to shift locations several times due to security. At one point, the crowd used trains in Vancouver to keep moving and stay ahead of any possible disruption.      As far as parties go (and DOGE parties, for that matter), this New Year's Eve set the tone for doge-themed celebrations.

42397692,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDjXN,1401617128,"Mining Roundup: Walmart, BFGMiner and Altcoins in the Cloud","Bitcoin's breakthrough from a rather stagnant price has certainly made miners happy as of late.  It might even entice the masses to splurge on a mining unit or two. Such an occurrence would certainly help the network as a whole.  The recent meeting of minds between Chinese mining hardware suppliers brings back to the fore just how centralized mining continues to be.  And while closed-door events like this are happening, the public must contend with the possibility that personal computers can be afflicted with mining malware – that's not positive for the cryptocurrency industry.  With that in mind, here is what has been going on in the mining sector since our last roundup.  Cloud contracts for altcoins  A number of companies see the futility of the miner hardware game and are moving into hosted mining, or cloud mining. The problem is it's really hard to differentiate most of the services. There isn't much to offer customers other than straight-up hashing power for some money-making transaction confirmations in the cloud.  Except for one thing: altcoins. While for the time being most hosted mining contracts only allow users bitcoin mining, Genesis Mining also offers a number of scrypt-based options.  The company provides mining power for bitcoin, litecoin, feathercoin, dogecoin, auroracoin, lottcoin and megacoin.  CoinDesk was given a free account with 1 MH/s and mined $1.19 of litecoin in a 24-hour period. If anything, Genesis-Mining can be a supplement or a temperature gauge for buying scrypt-based mining hardware – or both.  Walmart selling bitcoin miners  Perhaps trying to stay true to its slogan allowing people to 'save money, live better', Walmart is now selling bitcoin miners. In what appears to be a partnership with TigerDirect, the mega-retailer's customers can now shop online for a little piece of the bitcoin network to call their own.  Currently in stock is the Butterfly Labs Jalapeno. ""Get effective bitcoining with the Butterfly Labs Bitcoin Miner,"" the item description states. The Jalapeno model, which was released last summer, is 10GH/s and sells for $299 plus $5.70 shipping.  That's actually $50 more than what Butterfly Labs charges for the same model on its website.  10GH/s of SHA-256 mining power isn't what it used to be anyway. In fact, someone buying one of these units will probably never make that purchase price back in subsequent rewards.  BFGMiner software update  A popular client used with bitcoin mining hardware, BFGMiner updated its software to version 4.0. Some of the new features include hotplugging, proxies and scrypt support.  The client has also been updated with support for newer hardware from Gridseed, Butterfly Labs and Hex Fury. BFGMiner is available for Windows, Mac and Linux, making it versatile for whatever client equipment a miner decides to use.  The underlying software has been around for some time, dating back to the days when FPGAs were good enough to crank out block rewards.  According to the official release of the new version, its developers plan to build features into future releases promising alternative proof-of-work, decentralization and concurrent mining capabilities.  Gridcoin  It's entirely possible that future bitcoin mining rigs will only be able to run if provided with arbitrage opportunities in electrical costs. That means powering these miners might become a major issue for the security of the bitcoin network as more hashing comes online.  A cryptocurrency launched last year called gridcoin exists to solve this problem. The coin rewards miners who participate in projects that help the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) initiative.  According to its website, BOINC's grid computing projects are scientific research for curing disease, global warming issues and solving mathematical problems.  Anyone can download the software to help contribute to BOINC projects. However, hashing power provided through the gridcoin incentive could prove to be much more efficient than simply solving SHA-256 proof-of-work someday.  Hydro-only hosted mining  A UK-based company called MegaMine sells hosted mining contracts in the 10GH/s to 10TH/s range. Many other enterprising folks with datacenter access sell mining contracts, but MegaMine might offer a strategic advantage over others.  The company only sources power from water, or hydro, based sources, so it is able to pass the savings from lower electricity bills onto customers.  With increased network power, more electricity will be needed to power the next generation of miners. Even though smaller nodes means less consumption, the sheer scale of some datacenters necessitates competitive advantage.  European electricity is expensive, especially in countries like Germany, France and Spain. Miners there may find that MegaMine offers an alternative source of cheap hosting and energy.  Tracking hashrate getting harder  It appears as though increased centralization for bitcoin mining translates into less transparency. The Neighbourhood Pool Watch blog has a post exploring this. Some of the biggest mining pools do not provide hashrate per miner data. This makes it difficult to know just how many miners are hashing away.  There could be a number of reasons for this. For one, some of these pools may not want rivals to know what kind of equipment they use.  It's entirely possible that custom-made rigs with numerous ASICs on one board are used now, as opposed to a huge number of single miners.  What's evident is there will be consolidation in the industry – both in the number of mining units and companies. The merging of Cloud Hashing and HighBitcoin to form Peernova, as well as BitFury's $20m funding round led credence to one of many problematic issues for BTC: further centralization of confirmations on the bitcoin network.
