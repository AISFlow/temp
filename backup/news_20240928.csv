34094286,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=645215,1727564422,Is Shiba Inu Ready For A New All-Time High Above $0.00008? Analyst Says Yes,"Doggy-themed meme coin, Shiba Inu (SHIB), could be gearing up for a major rally to new all-time highs this bull cycle. Given the cryptocurrency’s recent bullish performance, analysts predict that Shiba Inu can surge above its all-time high of $0.000086. Shiba Inu Targets New All-Time Highs The price of Shiba Inu recently jumped from around $0.00001 to $0.00002. This significant price increase occurred in the last few weeks, hinting that the popular meme coin may be getting ready for a parabolic rally in the Fourth Quarter (Q4) of 2024. Related Reading: Ethereum Sees 43% Crash In Active Addresses, What’s Going On? Based on the meme coin’s current bullish performance, a crypto analyst and prominent Shiba Inu supporter identified as ‘SHIB Knight’ has expressed optimism about SHIB’s price outlook. In an X (formerly Twitter) post, the analyst shared a Shiba Inu price chart, suggesting that the popular meme coin was gearing up to surpass the $0.00008 mark. Further solidifying his bullish forecast, SHIB knight declared that Shiba Inu was finally ready for a new all-time high, marking a historical milestone for the meme coin. In October 2021, Shiba Inu achieved an all-time high of $0.000086, reflecting a 75.59% increase from its current price. Notably, SHIB has been building more momentum as September wraps up, hinting at a possible strong rally in October. Moreover, with the cryptocurrency currently trading at $0.00002, it would need a 330% surge to reclaim its former peak. Although SHIB Knight has not forecasted a specific date and price target, he has boldly announced that Shiba Inu could surpass its all-time highs, with the potential to break above $0.000086 this bull cycle. SHIB Maintains Powerful Momentum The price of Shiba Inu has been on a powerful upward trend in the past few weeks, achieving double-digit gains despite previous market declines. While the popular meme coin experienced its share of price declines earlier this year, Shiba Inu seems to be making a comeback, suggesting a renewed interest and demand from investors. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that SHIB has jumped by 48.20% over the past month. Additionally, the cryptocurrency saw another 45.84% increase in the last seven days, highlighting its strong price dynamics. Related Reading: Dogwifhat Rally Far From Over As Analysts Predicts 1,600% Jump Similarly, other meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pepe (PEPE) have been steadily gaining momentum in the past week. Pepe has recorded a price increase of over 38% in the past week, while Dogecoin has risen by 17%. This sudden change from bearish trends to bullish underscores a significant shift in investors’ sentiment towards the meme coin market. A crypto analyst identified as ‘AllInCrypto’ on X has also acknowledged the recent positive momentum in meme coins, highlighting that Shiba Inu’s price dynamics are looking great. The analyst also noted that the pullback for meme coins was likely over, as evidenced by Shiba Inu’s impressive price movements, which have recorded more gains of 9.48% just today.

The Maker (MKR) token is another one of the assets enjoying a positive week, with the DeFi (decentralized finance) coin recording a 12% price increase in the last seven days. Analyst Forecasts $1,850 Target For Maker Price In a recent post on the X platform, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez has put forward an exciting outlook for the price of Maker over the next few weeks. According to the crypto pundit, the token appears to be gearing up for a bullish breakout soon. Related Reading: Render (RENDER) Shows 23% Surge As Sharks & Whales Continue To Buy The rationale behind this bullish projection is the chart formation of an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on the four-hour timeframe. For context, the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern is a technical analysis formation characterized by three distinct troughs; a lower “head” between two higher “shoulders”. This chart often indicates a potential bullish reversal, where there is a shift from a downward trend to an uptrend. This trend reversal is confirmed when the price breaks above the neckline, which is a trendline connecting the peaks from the head-and-shoulders pattern. As shown in the highlighted chart, the Maker price has only just successfully broken above the neckline and appears to be retesting the trendline. Martinez noted that this breakout seems like a precursor to a 12% rally that would see the DeFi coin reclaim the $1,850 level. In a separate post on X, Martinez shared another bullish analysis for the price of MKR. This latest projection is based on the Tom Demark (TD) Sequential indicator, which is used in technical analysis to identify potential points of trend exhaustion and price reversal. According to Martinez, the TD Sequential has flashed four buy signals on the Maker three-day chart. This observation combined with the bullish breakout from the head-and-shoulders neckline suggests that a huge rally might be on the horizon.

The TD Sequential indicator has flashed four buy signals on the 3-day chart, suggesting it’s time to accumulate #MKR before it moons! pic.twitter.com/wfyayhB5rX — Ali (@ali_charts) September 27, 2024 Martinez hinted that this might be a critical period for accumulating the Maker token before its value skyrockets. Moreover, the cryptocurrency market, specifically the altcoin sector, appears to be veering towards an optimistic climate in the past few weeks. MKR Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of Maker stands at around $1,691, reflecting a 5% increase in the past day.

34088528,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=645184,1727550050,"Analyst Backs Bitcoin Hitting $290,000 In Bull Run – Here’s Why","In what has been an “unusual” September, Bitcoin (BTC) has now recorded another positive weekly performance. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the maiden cryptocurrency surged by 5.07% in the last seven days, moving its cumulative gain in this month to 11.30%. Interestingly, with Bitcoin halving since gone, analysts remain highly expectant of the traditional market bull run by the largest digital asset. Related Reading: Here’s Who Has Been Driving The Bitcoin Price Recovery Above $65,000 BTC In Consolidation As It Gathers Momentum For Breakout In an X post on Friday, popular analyst Crypto Rover predicted BTC will hit a $290,000 price mark in the upcoming bull run. Interestingly, this price projection tallies with previous statements from analysts who put a six-figure price target for BTC following the introduction of the Bitcoin spot ETFs which represents an increased institutional demand for the crypto market leader. Notably, BTC has been moving between $55,000 – $70,000 over the last seven months which represents a state of consolidation. According to Crypto Rover, following a breakout from this current sideways movement, Bitcoin is likely to enter the “banana zone” i.e. the phase of outrageous price growth, as seen in previous bull cycles. The crypto analyst predicts that during this period which traditionally lasts for 12-18 months, BTC could trade as high as $290,000 representing a 339.39% gain on the asset’s current price. For many crypto enthusiasts, it is likely that the much-anticipated breakout will occur in the fast-approaching weeks as Bitcoin has now formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern as highlighted by Crypto Rover in another post. To explain, the inverse head and shoulders pattern is a common bullish indicator of potential reversals of a downtrend. If the price breaks above the neckline with significant volume, it indicates a shift to bullish control. These sentiments on a price breakout are further strengthened by the upcoming Q4 which has proven to be the most bullish period for Bitcoin with an average gain of 88% over the last 11 years. Related Reading: MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Bet Pays Off In Multiple Ways As Stock Surges 317% Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Shows Bullish Signal In more positive news for the Bitcoin community, the Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoin Ratio is currently indicating a buy signal. According to CryptoQuant analyst with username EgyHash, this metric which measures BTC reserves (in USD) to the combined stablecoin reserves on exchange is currently at the low levels seen at the start of 2024. EgyHash explains that a low ratio indicates traders have an increased buying power due to high stablecoin holdings which could translate into investments in Bitcoin, thus resulting in a price gain. Therefore, the current low Bitcoin Exchange Ratio adds to the list of bullish signals for Bitcoin investors. At the time of writing, the premier cryptocurrency continues to trade at $66,064 with a 1.14% gain in the last day. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s daily trading volume is down by 12.92% and valued at $32.01 billion.

According to data from CoinMarketCap, Notcoin notched a 12.75% profit on Friday to emerge as the market’s top gainer. While the asset’s momentum appeared to have cooled following a price correction in the last few hours, certain trading indicators encourage investors to retain a bullish sentiment. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Telegram-Based Notcoin Is Ready To Fly, Here’s How High Notcoin To Hit $0.014 If Buying Pressure Persists: Analyst In an X post on Friday, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared a bullish prediction on Notcoin. According to Martinez, the SuperTrend indicator on the NOT’s daily chart has shown a buy signal following the token’s most recent ascent out of a falling wedge. The SuperTrend indicator just flashed a buy signal on the #Notcoin daily chart as $NOT breaks out of a falling wedge! Increased buying pressure could potentially push #NOT toward $0.012 to $0.014. pic.twitter.com/fJfWMDXCvV — Ali (@ali_charts) September 27, 2024 Generally, the SuperTrend is a simple technical indicator used to predict the potential direction of an asset’s price. A buy signal occurs when the price moves above the SuperTrendine suggesting the asset would likely maintain its upward trajectory. According to Martinez, if investors are influenced by the SuperTrend indicator, thus increasing capital influx into Notcoin market, the token could likely surge trade as high as $0.012 – $0.014 representing a potential 41.41% gain on its present market value. In the presence of an overwhelming bullish pressure, NOT could rise to around $0.020 reaching price levels last seen in early August. Alternatively, if a price fall were to occur perhaps due to news events or macroeconomic factors, the telegram-based asset will likely find support around $0.0069.

Nevertheless, NOT has quickly grown into a major digital asset, earning a spot in the top 100 cryptocurrencies with a market cap of $1 billion.

34082913,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=645216,1727535649,Analysts Who Correctly Predicted Bitcoin March ATH Forecasts What Happens Next,"10xResearch analysts who had correctly predicted the Bitcoin price run-up to a new all-time high earlier in the year have turned bullish once again. In a recent report by 10xResearch Head of Research, Markus Thielen, the analysts point out a number of factors that have seen the BTC price turn bullish. Just like before, this is a development that could lead to a run-up to a new all-time high for the Bitcoin price, something that could mark the beginning of another bull market. Fed’s Rate Cut Triggers Bitcoin Uprising Following the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates by 0.5 bps earlier in the month, the Bitcoin price has been on a positive uptrend. It rose from trending around $53,000 to rising above $66,000 in a matter of weeks. However, the uptrend may be far from done as the analysts see further upside. Related Reading: Dogwifhat Rally Far From Over As Analysts Predicts 1,600% Jump In the report, the 10xResearch analysts point to the rise in stablecoin minting and billions in inflows from Chinese over-the-counter brokers as reasons why the rally could continue. Since the Fed rate cuts, approximately $10 billion in new stablecoins have been minted. Naturally, this is positive for the Bitcoin market as it means new inflow is coming in. The report explains that year-to-date stablecoin inflows have now topped $35 billion. Another positive development with this is the rise in the decentralized finance (DeFi) activity across the space. There has been increased fee revenue, signaling more participation. “While activity has slowed in September, activity and fees could rebound following the Fed’s recent rate cut,” the report read. The analysts believe that the Bitcoin price is now targeting new all-time highs after breaking the downtrend that has plagued it for months. “With Bitcoin breaking above $65,000, we anticipate a swift move toward $70,000, followed by new all-time highs in the near term,” the analyst said. Altcoin Season Is On The Way The Fed rate cuts has not be positive for the Bitcoin price only as the altcoin market has also followed suit. There has been an over 20% jump in the altcoin market cap this month alone, showing that they’re also following the bullish trend being set by Bitcoin. Related Reading: Ethereum Sees 43% Crash In Active Addresses, What’s Going On? There has been a notable decline in the BTC dominance since the Fed announcement. This suggests that altcoins are gaining ground, and if the Bitcoin dominance continues to fall, it could signal the start of another altcoin season. “A notable shift occurred following last week’s FOMC meeting: Bitcoin’s dominance has waned, while Ethereum gas fees have spiked, fueled by a surge in altcoin activity across the ecosystem,” the analysts stated. “If the Federal Reserve remains open to cutting rates, pursuing high-beta altcoins will likely gather further momentum.” Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",POSITIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-what-happens-next/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

34080104,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=645172,1727528400,"Dogecoin Could Target $0.20 Soon, Analyst Predicts – Is DOGE Primed For A Rally?","Dogecoin is trading above $0.12 after a 20% pump over the past two days, reigniting investor enthusiasm. The meme coin had been struggling to break past the $0.11 mark, leaving investors frustrated as other cryptocurrencies surged. The recent breakout has lifted sentiment, with Dogecoin now eyeing higher targets. Analysts believe that this momentum could lead to further gains as DOGE successfully clears key resistance levels. Related Reading: XRP Struggles Below $0.60 – Metrics Reveal Growing Selling Pressure One prominent analyst has even set a bullish target of $0.20 in the coming weeks, suggesting that Dogecoin could see another significant rally if the broader market remains strong. The recent breakout could signal the beginning of a more extended uptrend, especially if DOGE can maintain support above $0.12 and continue attracting buying interest. Investors will be keeping a close eye on how Dogecoin performs in the days ahead. Dogecoin Price Rising Fast Dogecoin is now testing crucial supply levels around $0.125, a price point not seen since late July. As the entire crypto market surged, sentiment shifted rapidly from fear to hope. Investors are now eyeing Dogecoin with renewed optimism, anticipating further gains in the coming weeks. Prominent analyst TraderNJ recently shared a detailed technical analysis on X, highlighting key resistance levels for DOGE at $0.149, $0.178, and $0.208. TraderNJ expressed strong confidence in the meme coin’s performance, predicting that Dogecoin could hit the $0.20 mark “in no time at all.” This bullish outlook reflects the high expectations surrounding Dogecoin, as historical patterns show that when meme coins start to rally, they often experience rapid price acceleration. Dogecoin’s current price action suggests that a breakthrough past $0.125 could open the door for significant upward momentum. The crypto market has shown resilience and a tendency to surprise skeptics, and Dogecoin is no exception. If DOGE manages to break above its immediate resistance levels, it could potentially trigger a fast-paced rally, similar to its historical price movements. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Eyes 20% Price Surge – Funding Rate Suggests Increasing Demand Traders and investors are closely monitoring Dogecoin’s performance as it tests these crucial levels. A sustained push above $0.125 would be a positive signal, reinforcing the bullish sentiment and potentially attracting more buying interest. However, the meme coin’s notorious volatility means that sharp fluctuations could accompany any breakout. As optimism builds, the next few weeks will be critical for determining whether Dogecoin can maintain its momentum and achieve the price targets set by analysts like TraderNJ. DOGE Price Action: Key Levels To Watch Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently trading at $0.124 after two days of impressive gains and renewed market excitement. The meme coin recently closed above the daily 200 exponential moving average (EMA) at $0.117, a critical indicator that it had not surpassed since late July. Reclaiming this level suggests a potential shift in momentum, indicating long-term strength and a more positive outlook for the weeks ahead. However, sustaining this upward trend will require DOGE to maintain its position above the 1D 200 EMA and continue to challenge higher supply levels around $0.14. If the price manages to break through this resistance, it could pave the way for further gains and solidify its bullish trend. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Dogecoin Will Surge 1,000% Past ATH – Price Targets Revealed On the flip side, if Dogecoin fails to hold above the 1D 200 EMA, the bullish scenario could quickly reverse. A retracement to lower demand levels around $0.105 would then be expected, potentially signaling a pause in the recent rally. Investors are watching closely to see if Dogecoin can maintain its momentum or if it will face another pullback, as it has in previous months. The next few days will be crucial for determining the meme coin’s short-term direction.

34077369,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=645082,1727521211,"Bitcoin Breaks $66,000, But Analyst Warns Against Fresh Longs—Here’s Why","Bitcoin has shown bullish momentum during the past day, but an analyst has pointed out how the asset may be in a high-risk zone now due to the Open Interest trend. Bitcoin Open Interest Has Seen A Rapid Increase Recently As explained by CryptoQuant community manager Maartunn in a new post on X, the Bitcoin Open Interest has just surged to high levels. The “Open Interest” is an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of BTC-related positions currently open on all derivatives exchanges. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Rallies 34%, But Will FOMO End The Rally? When the value of this metric rises, it means the investors are opening up fresh positions on the derivatives market right now. As the overall leverage in the sector increases when this trend occurs, it can lead to higher asset price volatility. On the other hand, the indicator heading down suggests the derivatives contract holders are either closing up positions of their own volition or getting forcibly liquidated by their platform. This kind of trend can lead to more stability for BTC. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Open Interest over the past year: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Open Interest had cooled off to relatively low levels earlier in the month as the asset’s price crashed. With the recovery in the coin, however, the indicator has been noting growth again. The indicator is now high, potentially implying the market has become overleveraged. As mentioned earlier, a high metric value can lead to more volatility for BTC. The reason behind this is that mass liquidation events can become more probable to occur at these levels, making the price act more volatile. On paper, the volatility emerging from an Open Interest increase can take the coin in either direction, but BTC has shown a consistent pattern in the past year. As the analyst has highlighted in the chart, the indicator entering into the same zone as now has generally turned out to be bearish for Bitcoin in this window. Related Reading: Render (RENDER) Shows 23% Surge As Sharks & Whales Continue To Buy In these instances, the Open Interest surge had occurred alongside price surges, indicating that long positions had been piling up. The latest growth in the indicator has also naturally come similarly. “We’re in a high-risk zone, and in my opinion, it’s not the best time for fresh long positions,” notes Maartunn. It remains to be seen how Bitcoin develops in the coming days and if it will hit the top, just like it did during those other instances.

34075283,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=645137,1727515824,Analysts Think Solana Could ‘Go Nuts’ As SOL Price Retests $160 Resistance,"Solana (SOL) broke above a key resistance level on Friday, fueling the bullish sentiment that reignited over a week ago. As a result, some analysts think the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization could be about to see a massive bull run as “Uptober” approaches. Related Reading: Ethereum: Analyst Sets $2,820 As ETH’s Next Key Level to Watch, Here’s Why Solana Retests $160 Resistance Solana’s rally started last week following the market surge driven by the US Federal Reserve’s rate cuts. The jump pushed the cryptocurrency’s price above the $140 resistance level, successfully turning it into support. SOL had failed to break above this key level throughout the past month, consolidating between the $130-$139 price range. This performance alarmed many investors and market watchers, who considered the cryptocurrency was in danger of facing a massive correction. Since the bullish catalyst, Solana has seen a 23% surge, breaking above the $150 barrier this week. Some analysts asserted that reclaiming this mark would propel the price toward the next key resistance level. On Friday, Solana broke above the crucial resistance level for the first time in a month, hitting $160 for the first time since late August. As of this writing, SOL reached a daily high of $160.68, momentarily holding the above the key level. This performance was seemingly fueled by the “bullish vibes” surrounding the early release from prison of Binance’s founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ). The expectation of his release further inspired a bullish market sentiment among investors, driving SOL’s 4% jump in an hour and Bitcoin’s price to $66,000. Is SOL Price About To “Go Insane”? Analyst Crypto Horn Harris noted Solana’s price action on the weekly chart, claiming it “looks nothing short of insane right now.” He underscored that SOL’ retested the Relative Strength Index (RSI) “properly” while doing a “perfect reset” of the 50-day Moving Average (MA). To the analyst, this performance hints that the cryptocurrency will challenge the cycle’s high above $200 and move to higher targets soon. WiseAnalyze claimed that SOL’s price “is still very low,” suggesting that investors still can “jump on that trend.” The trader set his target for the cycle’s final breakout at $400, “but it might grow higher.” However, he didn’t rule out the possibility of another rejection, with a pullback to the $108-$120 support zones. Similarly, Matthew Dixon also forecasted a retrace for Solana. The analyst believes a pullback is due, as multiple indicators suggest the correction. However, the “jury is out on the scope of the decline.” Dixon stated that SOL’s price targets will depend on whether “the price action from the low is in the form ABC Or 123.” But “either way, the retrace is likely.” Related Reading: Memecoin Sensation Popcat Hits New All-Time High After Surge To $1 Crypto analyst Byzantine General considers SOL’s chart to look “pretty crazy.” The trader highlighted that Solana appears to be printing an Adam and Eve (A&E) double-bottom pattern, with the confirmation line around the $160 price range. Based on this, Solana’s price “could go really nuts,” as it has the potential for a breakout toward the $200 resistance level if it successfully reclaims the key support level.

Trading Guru Sees A Bullish Breakout on the Horizon—Here’s Why,"Veteran commodity trader Peter Brandt recently drew attention to Dogecoin (DOGE), the largest meme-based cryptocurrency by market capitalization, suggesting a potential bullish breakout. Brandt shared a DOGE/USDT chart in a post on X, pointing to a breakout DOGE has recently achieved from a descending channel that the asset has been stuck in for over half a year. Related Reading: Dogecoin Eyes Bullish 50% Rally To $0.16, But Will A Crash Come First? Identified Bullish Momentum in Dogecoin The chart shared by Brandt further reveals that DOGE, which had previously been trading within a horizontal channel for roughly two years between July 2022 and July 2024, experienced fluctuations between a lower trend line of $0.05 and an upper level of $0.1181. DOGE peaked at $0.2100 in March before entering its descending pattern. Now, signs indicate that DOGE might be breaking free from this downward trend. Brandt emphasized that the longer-term chart for DOGE could be considered “constructive,” supporting his analysis with the encouraging message, “Get along little doggie.” So far, DOGE has been riding the positive wave seen in the broader crypto market. The asset’s price climbed 8.2% in the past 24 hours, trading at around $0.1235. While this upward trend aligns with the market’s general bullish sentiment, Brandt’s technical analysis suggests that DOGE’s breakout could signal the beginning of a more sustained upward movement. Other Bullish Indicators for DOGE’s Momentum Peter Brandt’s observation is not the only bullish sentiment surrounding Dogecoin. Another prominent crypto analyst, Ali, recently noted that DOGE appears to be showing strength. In an X post uploaded on September 26, Ali pointed out that DOGE has experienced a Relative Strength Index (RSI) and price breakout from multi-month downtrends. Furthermore, the asset has received a buy signal from the SuperTrend indicator. These developments indicate that momentum is potentially shifting toward the meme-based cryptocurrency. Before DOGE’s surge above $0.12 today, Ali had set specific conditions for a full-fledged bullish rally for the asset. These conditions included breaking the descending trendline of RSI on the daily chart and pushing past a resistance level of $0.11. #Dogecoin is gearing up for a bullish breakout!

34070782,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=645098,1727505006,Bitcoin Set For Biggest September Gains In A Decade: Here’s Why,"Bitcoin (BTC) looks poised to record its best September in a decade, surging past $65,000. This uncharacteristic price appreciation could be attributed to several key factors. Reasons Behind Bitcoin’s Impressive September Gains Historically, September has consistently been the worst month for BTC in terms of price performance. However, the apex cryptocurrency is now on track to post its best September in at least a decade, driven by several macroeconomic developments. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Top At $400,000 Based On This Model, Analyst Says On September 18, the US Federal Reserve (Fed) initiated its interest rate cut cycle for the first time in four years, slashing rates by 50 basis points (bps) in response to slowing inflation and rising unemployment. The rate cut immediately impacted risk-on assets, including BTC, which has appreciated by over 10% since the cut. In comparison, Bitcoin’s average price decline in September over the past decade has been 3.45%, according to the chart below from CoinGlass. According to the Fed’s decision, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) lowered borrowing costs to stimulate their respective economies. This further propelled BTC’s price towards its previous highs. Bitcoin halving is another key factor that could now be starting to show its effect on the digital asset’s price action. Bitcoin underwent its halving earlier this year in April, reducing block confirmation rewards for miners from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. Past data indicates that halving has typically been a bullish trigger for Bitcoin due to the resulting supply scarcity. For instance, in May 2020, BTC price rose from roughly $8,900 before the halving to more than $64,000 by April 2021 – an 8x price surge in less than a year. Meanwhile, US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continue to witness rising interest from retail and institutional investors alike, as they recorded $365.57 million in total net daily inflows on September 26, the largest since late July. Since their launch, the cumulative net inflow for Bitcoin ETFs now totals $18.31 billion. Cautious Optimism Key To Riding The BTC Wave While BTC appears to have shaken off its typical September slump, it’s worth highlighting that the leading digital asset still needs to overcome certain important price levels before hitting a new all-time-high (ATH). Related Reading: Here Is Why The Bitcoin Bull Run Hasn’t Started, According To Analyst As previously reported, Bitcoin’s relative strength index (RSI) fell below 80 on the monthly chart, signaling that the cryptocurrency’s bullish momentum might fade after an enthusiastic buying spree. In addition, a recent report by crypto exchange Bitfinex noted that despite Bitcoin’s recent upward movement, it must decisively overcome a strong resistance level of $65,200 to continue its positive momentum. The good news for bulls is that BTC is holding steady at $65,674, up 2% in the last 24 hours.

Grayscale Highlights Key Trends In Crypto In its Thursday report, Grayscale updated its Crypto Sectors Indexes, showcasing emerging themes within the digital asset industry. Key trends include the rise of decentralized artificial intelligence (AI) platforms, efforts to tokenize traditional assets, and the growing popularity of memecoins. Notably, Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency sector have outperformed other market segments in 2024, likely due to the successful launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) in the US earlier this year and favorable macroeconomic conditions following the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) interest rate cut on 18 September. Related Reading: Altcoin Market Cap Surges Past 200-Day EMA: Is Altseason Finally Here? While gaining 13% this year, Ethereum has underperformed Bitcoin but still surpassed many other cryptocurrencies. Grayscale’s Crypto Sectors Market Index (CSMI) has seen a slight decline of about 1% year-to-date, with the Smart Contract Platforms Crypto Sector Index down approximately 11%, making Ethereum’s performance relatively stronger than its peers. Despite its challenges, the asset manager finds that Ethereum remains the Smart Contract Platforms sector leader, boasting the highest number of applications, developers, and fee revenue. Top 20 Cryptocurrencies For Upcoming Quarter In producing its quarterly Top 20 list of cryptocurrencies, Grayscale thoroughly analyzes hundreds of digital assets. This list represents a diversified selection of assets with high potential for the upcoming quarter. Among those highlighted by the firm are standout performers such as Sui (SUI), Bittensor (TAO), Optimism (OP), Helium (HNT), Celo (CELO) and the UMA Protocol (UMA). However, below is the full list with other assets beyond these to which Grayscale pays particular attention. Sui, a third-generation blockchain created by former Meta engineers, has made waves following a recent network upgrade that enhanced its transaction speed by 80%, surpassing Solana’s capabilities. Optimism, an Ethereum Layer 2 solution, plays a critical role in scaling the Ethereum network. It has developed a framework called the “Superchain,” which is utilized by platforms like Coinbase’s Layer 2 BASE. Celo and UMA are capitalizing on unique trends, with Celo focusing on stablecoin use and payment solutions in developing regions, particularly in Africa. The platform recently surpassed Tron in stablecoin usage, while UMA serves as an oracle network for decentralized applications like Polymarket. Related Reading: MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Bet Pays Off In Multiple Ways As Stock Surges 317% Helium’s inclusion in the Top 20 reflects Grayscale’s preference for category leaders with sustainable revenue models. The project has established itself as a leader in decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), growing its network to over one million hotspots and generating significant fee revenues. Bittensor, which focuses on the intersection of AI and crypto, has recently gained recognition within Grayscale’s framework due to improvements in market structure, offering a decentralized platform for AI innovation. In this quarter’s adjustments, Grayscale has rotated out several assets, including Render, Mantle, ThorChain, Pendle, Illuvium, and Raydium. While Grayscale sees value in these projects, the revised Top 20 list aims to offer more compelling risk-adjusted returns for investors in the coming months. At the time of writing, the biggest winner across all time frames in Grayscale’s top 20 list is Bittensor’s TAO token, which has seen gains of 86% over the fourteen-day time frame and a substantial 841% year-to-date, resulting in a current trading price of $536.

The introduction of non-futures ETFs options chains and subsequently volatility selling products could attract more investors by offering high distribution rates and perceived safety. Recent net inflows into global crypto funds suggest growing investor confidence, driven by dovish FOMC comments and interest rate cuts. The regulatory environment appears to be shifting towards a more crypto-friendly stance, as evidenced by the approval of Ethereum and Bitcoin ETF options. Last week, options were approved for BlackRock's ( BLK ) iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ). This is big news for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). I expected the SEC to delay this as long as possible. I expect this, as well as other factors, to be quite supportive of the Bitcoin price in the near term. It's true that option contracts already trade on crypto exchanges and are available on the Bitcoin futures ETF. In theory, it shouldn't be a significant change. However, this is a major ETF with a tremendous amount of AUM and daily volume. Data by YCharts A non-futures ETF is considered more attractive by some investors. The fees on this generation of ETFs are also considerably lower, which is a real advantage. Perhaps more important than the direct liquidity boost from this new option chain is the fact that other ETFs will follow, and now nothing stands in the way of a put-selling or covered-call-selling product being introduced. Products like that exist for single-name stocks like Nvidia ( NVDA ), Tesla (TSLA), and Coinbase ( COIN ). These are then marketed as yield vehicles and can flaunt very high distribution rates. I've written about several of these, for example Why A 106.68% Yield May Not Be Enough , as I'm fascinated by these products and their effects on the underlying market. For good measure, usually, I'm not a fan of getting into these, although there are exceptional circumstances where it could be interesting. Bitcoin is known as a volatile asset. Annualized at-the-market volatility for Bitcoin has been around 47% over the past 7 days and around ~60% over the past 180 days. Volatility selling products based on Bitcoin will be able to advertise very high expected distributions or projections based on historical data. Think of annualized distribution rates of 100%+. Products that mimic a covered call position are often deemed ""safer"". I'm not sure that they are. However, I do believe they could draw new investors into an asset. Think of investors who are interested but find it to be a bit too speculative. Both the greenlighting of these options and secondary the launch of products with the above profile will, over time, lead to Bitcoin volatility going down further. A process that will allow another group of traders/investors (quants/trend-followers) that volatility weight their exposures to ramp up exposure. Meanwhile, global crypto funds are now experiencing net inflows for the 2nd week in a row, according to this report by CoinShares. This could be random noise. The firm specifically calls out the 50bp rate cut as a catalyst. I'd argue the market has been pricing in a few cuts for a while now. Still, the decision may have given some investors the reassurance they were looking for. I feel compelled to touch on a political sensitive issue for a minute. Personally, I have no direct stake in the U.S. election, as I'm Dutch. I'm discussing it because crypto has turned into somewhat of a battleground. Vice-President Harris now appears to be interested in a less restrictive crypto climate ( per Bloomberg ). I could be mistaken, but I viewed the Ethereum ETF approval earlier this year as a key shift in thinking on the Democratic side. In my opinion, this event could have been delayed by the SEC a while longer. Up to that point, the crypto community had generally been disappointed with the SEC's stance vs crypto. Meanwhile, Trump is increasingly campaigning as a pro-crypto candidate as well. Both candidates are now more open about crypto . This means there isn't really an election outcome that leads to a worse regulatory outcome. Political crypto headlines are also unlikely to be negative because neither candidate sees value in opposing crypto. The final reason it's a good time to look at Bitcoin is that Mount Gox and German government distributions have been a recent overhang on the market. Coinshares did an in-depth analysis of this overhang here. This is a chart from that report: bitcoin liquidity events (Coinshares) Coinshares concluded, which has more or less borne out, that the impact of this selling would be relatively muted. Their primary argument is that the selling wouldn't happen all at once. The one argument from the report I don't entirely agree with is that holders could have sold claims (to specialized claims buyers), and since they did not, this supposedly indicates they aren't interested in turning these positions from Bitcoin into USD. The claims buyers are generally professional specialized parties, and claims-sellers to a degree realize they are not the smart money in these transactions. It makes sense these parties are looking for a high rate of return as there is quite a bit of risk to it and these investments can't be levered up. Sellers simply may not have wanted to take the haircut. Especially as these distributions were supposed to take place quite a bit earlier. Yet, parties that wanted to sell could also have sold Bitcoin futures short or bought puts in advance of the distributions. In these cases, the market impact happened ahead of the distributions. Data by YCharts My first article on Bitcoin dates back to 2016. At that time, it traded at ~$630. The ticker BTC-USD wasn't available on the platform. In that article, I floated the idea that Bitcoin could reach a $8 trillion market cap based on the ""digital gold"" idea. I don't think viewing Bitcoin as the ""digital gold"" is correct. However, it helps to construct an idea of what an upside scenario may look like. Since that time, people dug up more gold AND it advanced in price. The total value of all existing gold is estimated to be around $16 trillion. Bitcoin advanced more rapidly, and its total value is now around $1.3 trillion. In my first article on Bitcoin, I said this upside scenario could result in a 900x+ bagger. That's now less reasonable. That same scenario being achieved would still result in a 10x. On the other hand, it has become way less likely Bitcoin will be abandoned or turn out a failure. Big picture, I still think this is an asymmetric bet. I'd like to get out of Bitcoin if it dropped below $50k. This would indicate a clear break from the recent bullish trajectory, and I would reassess based on the events driven such bearish price action. Seeking Alpha has seasonality data on the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ), the oldest Bitcoin fund, going back 8 years. If you take the average returns over the final 3 months of the year and assume Bitcoin appreciates by that figure, it will be at $88k at year-end. I think that's a big ask from Bitcoin at this stage, but it should be reasonable as the higher end of what's possible. Based on the current bullish price action, the seasonality data, experience with previous bull runs, I would not be surprised if Bitcoin touched $90K in the next 3–12 months.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4723888-why-this-is-good-time-to-go-long-bitcoin-despite-its-44-percent-run-up?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/34067015.jpeg

34066329,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=645006,1727494205,"Ethereum Sees 43% Crash In Active Addresses, What’s Going On?","The market sentiment towards Ethereum (ETH) has turned relatively bearish, largely due to the cryptocurrency’s recent price volatility. This negative sentiment is evident in Ethereum’s new active addresses, having crashed by a whopping 43%, underscoring reduced network activity and investor confidence. New Active Addresses On Ethereum Decline Data from The Block is showing notable fluctuations in Ethereum’s network activity, as the number of new active addresses has seen a sharp unexpected decline over the past three months. On June 27, new active addresses on the Ethereum network surged to 138,620 before dropping drastically to around 89,000 in the first few weeks of July. While the volume fluctuated between 80,000 and 95,000 in August, it soon jumped back above 100,000 at the end of the month. Related Reading: Bitcoin Descending Triangle Formation Says A Crash Is Coming, How Low Can It Go? Despite Ethereum experiencing a significant uptick in its price recently, the new active addresses on its network dropped as low as 78,100 on September 24, marking a 23.43% crash. Currently, the number of new active addresses on Ethereum’s network is still below 80,000, reflecting more than a 44% crash from the last three months. Compared to June 9 when the total active addresses on the Ethereum network surged impressively to 702,857, the current number of addresses has declined by 5.69%. Moreover, on September 22, the total active address count fell drastically to 574,073, underscoring an 18.32% decrease from the previous June 9 high. Typically, when a crypto network experiences a drop in its new active address count, it indicates a decrease in user engagement, leading to a decline in the overall network activity and transaction volume. This decrease can be seen in the data provided by IntoTheBlock, which shows that the total volume of large transactions on the Ethereum network rose to 2.91 million on July 5, but declined to 1.79 million on September 29, reflecting a 38.4% drop. Despite the significant drop in new active addresses on Ethereum, market intelligence platform, Santiment has disclosed that the Ethereum network activity is finally picking up. However, this rise in network activity also coincides with a significant increase in gas fee levels. ETH Loses Top Spot In DEX Volume Rankings On September 25, Ethereum lost its position as the top cryptocurrency with the highest 24-hours Decentralized Exchange (DEX) volume. Solana (SOL) had outperformed Ethereum, claiming the top spot with a 39.77% increase in its DEX volume, which climbed to $1.123 billion. Related Reading: Historical Trends Put Bitcoin At $400,000 With Shocking Timeline At the time, Ethereum’s DEX volume was approximately $1.118 billion after recording a modest 8.92% surge. While Solana briefly stole the spotlight, Ethereum swiftly rebounded and has since held on to its leading position. As of writing, the cryptocurrency’s 24-hour DEX volume has surged by 11%, reaching $1.559 billion, according to DeFiLama. In contrast, Solana experienced a much larger increase of 32.94%, however, its volume still sits below Ethereum’s at $1.251 billion.

Shiba Inu Has Seen An Uptick In Activity With Its Latest Rally In a new post on X, the analytics firm Santiment has discussed how the various indicators related to Shiba Inu have looked while its price has shot up 34% over the past week. There are three on-chain metrics of interest here: Volume, Circulation, and Whale Transaction Count. The first of these, Volume, tracks the total amount of SHIB involved in trades on the major exchanges every day. This indicator naturally reflects how intense the investors’ trading interest in the coin is. Related Reading: Render (RENDER) Shows 23% Surge As Sharks & Whales Continue To Buy Circulation also relates to activity, but it’s not restricted to exchanges. This metric measures the total number of unique tokens of the asset participating in transactions on the network. Whenever the Volume spikes without a corresponding spike in this indicator, it means that the trading activity around the meme coin is potentially coming from wash trading. The last indicator, the Whale Transaction Count, tells us about how many transactions valued at more than $1 million are being executed on the Shiba Inu network every day. Generally, only the whale entities are capable of making such large single-transfer shifts, so this metric reflects the activity that the large hands of the market are participating in. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in these three SHIB on-chain metrics over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, all three of these Shiba Inu indicators have registered a sharp uptick alongside the latest price surge, implying that activity as a whole has spiked on the network. Generally, a rise in activity is a good sign whenever rallies occur, as it suggests investors are getting drawn to the coin. It’s usually the influx of traders that provides the fuel that price moves like these need to keep going. The latest rise in the SHIB metrics, however, is a bit extreme, potentially indicating that traders are getting too excited too quickly. Santiment has also pointed out that social media discussions related to the coin have spiked at the same time, lending further credence to the fact that the investors are feeling FOMO. Cryptocurrency markets have historically tended to move against the expectations of the majority, so when the crowd shows this much hype, a top can become probable to take place.

These inflows, according to Farside Investors, have reached a remarkable $365 million as of September 26, 2024, which is indicative of the increasing institutional interest in the cryptocurrency market. Related Reading: Stacks: New Network Upgrades Push STX Price Up By 18% – Details Record Inflows Amid Market Optimism The biggest daily flow for the month came from BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, which surged about $184 million on September 25, 2024. This spike coincides with withdrawals from numerous other ETFs, indicating a significant change in institutional investors’ view. Although there were just $2.1 million in inflows into other platforms such as the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF, BlackRock’s performance is noteworthy and serves as a ray of hope among the market’s volatility. For the past five days, there has been a positive cumulative inflow of around $497 million into US spot Bitcoin ETFs. The Federal Reserve’s recent move to lower interest rates by 50 basis points is partly the reason for this increase since it has prompted investors to look for other assets like Bitcoin. The overall digital asset investment products have also seen a second consecutive week of inflows, totaling approximately $321 million, with BTC being the primary focus, accounting for about $284 million of that total. Institutional Trust And Financial Aspects The present surge of money into Bitcoin ETFs indicates a bigger trend in which institutional investors are beginning to view Bitcoin as a tactical asset. Further supporting the positive outlook are economic factors such the Federal Reserve’s dovish stance, which has calmed investors about likely economic stability. The CEO of CryptoQuant, Ki Young Ju, stressed that strengthening the US’s standing as a pioneer in the cryptocurrency space depends on the increasing demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs. The 🇺🇸U.S. is regaining dominance in #Bitcoin holdings. Its ratio compared to other countries is rising, driven by spot ETF demand.
