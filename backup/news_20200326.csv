42404294,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdho8B,1585266961,Bankruptcy Trustee to Hand Quadriga Users' Information to Canadian Taxman,"Ernst & Young (EY), the court-appointed bankruptcy trustee overseeing the winding up of crypto exchange QuadrigaCX, will be turning all user information over to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).      EY reported Tuesday that the CRA had asked for a trove of information about QuadrigaCX, whose customers have been waiting for more than a year to get back $190 million deposited on the exchange.      The requested information includes: financial statements and other business records; corporate legal records; documents related to contractors and other related parties; a list of accounts and wallet addresses, “detailed information” on the fiat and crypto owed to users, analysis on “user specific transaction activities,” and identified accounts.      “The Trustee has advised CRA that its intention is to simply produce a copy of the full EDiscovery Database, redacted only for privilege, in response to the CRA Production Demand,” EY’s latest report said.      The database does include users’ personal information, as well as account balances and transaction data.      It contains 750,000 individual documents, EY said in a previous report. At the time of its collapse, Quadriga had 115,000 users with balances on the platform.      See also: How to Stop the Next Quadriga: Make Exchanges Prove Their Reserves      Miller Thomson, the court-appointed law firm representing Quadriga’s former users, wrote in a letter Thursday it would not oppose the move in the interests of reducing costs and not further delaying any distribution of funds to the users.      Members of the creditor’s committee – a handful of former Quadriga users who represent the overall group in discussions with Miller Thomson – had differing views on the potential privacy concerns of turning this information over to the CRA, the letter said.      “Among other things, Committee members debated at length concerns about sharing the information with the CRA, the safeguarding of that information, the nature of the personal information contained on the Database, the value of the privacy interest affected, and the reasonable expectations of Affected Users,” it read.      Magdalena Gronowska, one member of the committee wrote on Twitter Thursday that the CRA’s request is “an unprecedented affront to individual privacy.”      “I’m concerned this smells like a [fishing] expedition,” she said, explaining that EY has already said in the past that it may be difficult to calculate taxes, and wondering whether the CRA really needs user data to calculate the exchange’s liability.      Toronto-based QuadrigaCX folded in early 2019 after reporting that its founder and CEO, Gerald Cotten, had died while traveling in India. Cotten had sole control over the exchange’s private keys and was the only individual operating it at the time of his death, his widow said in an affidavit. Quadriga’s former users question whether Cotten actually died or whether his death was natural, and have now asked Canadian authorities multiple times to exhume and autopsy his body.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/26/bankruptcy-trustee-to-hand-quadriga-users-information-to-canadian-taxman,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/30d8a258769eb414de585f189d7a5dea72576522-1200x779.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin (BTC) was up 1 percent while ether (ETH) up by less than 1 percent.      Notable 24 hour performances on CoinDesk’s digital asset board today as of 20:00 UTC include monero (XMR), up 8 percent; tron (TRX), up 3 percent and IOTA (IOTA) in the green by 2 percent. Assets in the red include bitcoin SV (BSV), down 1 percent; NEO (NEO) lower by less than 1 percent and Zcash (ZEC) down under 1 percent.      Japan’s Nikkei 225 Index closed its day at 5:00 UTC down 4.5 percent, a reversal for the key Asian equities market after spending the week closing in the green. As for Europe, the FTSE 100 Index was up 2 percent at its session close 17:00 UTC. This comes after the British equity index delivered its second-best percentage gain on record on Tuesday, March 24, climbing 9.1 percent. In the U.S., the S&P 500 Index closed up 6 percent at 20:00 UTC.      “Looks like stimulus is short-term good for all assets, crypto included,” said Kevin Zhou, CEO of algorithmic trading firm Galois Capital.      See also: We Won’t Ever Think About the Financial System the Same Way      Indeed, while stimulus appears to be keeping markets up, longer-term economic troubles loom. U.S. industrial output has already taken a significant hit as coronavirus and government-mandated business closures hit crucial economic engines.      On March 24, IHS Markit released its monthly report on the composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI). PMI tracks the overall health of the U.S. manufacturing and service sectors and it came in at 40.5, down from 49.6 in February, the largest drop since 2008.      “We may very well be in a recession, but I would point to the difference between this and a normal recession,” U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said March 26 in an interview with NBC. “There is nothing fundamentally wrong with our economy,” he added.      On Sunday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said his department will work with Congress on creating financing programs, which he estimated could involve as much as $4 trillion. In addition, the government intends to provide another $2 trillion in stimulus to individual Americans, a measure passed unanimously in the Senate and set for vote in the House Friday.      “Pouring $6 trillion artificially creates somewhat of a ‘positive’ effect. But to me it’s like a bomb in slow motion. We will see dramatic consequences of these decisions,” said Constantin Kogan, a partner at cryptocurrency fund-of-funds BitBull Capital.       Indeed, cryptocurrency traders are concerned with the direction bitcoin price might go. The market experienced a huge jump around 12:00 UTC on March 23. After that big bounce, bitcoin’s price has been in a range between $6,400 and $6,900 on Coinbase since March 24.

42404286,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdho3G,1585255728,"Geopolitical Crisis May Benefit Oil, Gold and CBDCs, Not Bitcoin","Demand for goldhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-faces-historic-squeeze-virus-172242743.html is skyrocketing and the clamor for scarce assets in a remote-first world was precisely where bitcoin was supposed to shine.    However, rather than creating a perfect scenario for the supranational money, the coronavirus crisis could instead entrench reliance on traditional institutions. In a world where central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) from major economies are fast approaching, bitcoin settlements may appear less attractive to compliance-focused financial entities.      As for short-term market signals, it’s more common for big traders to turn to oil or gold these days, according to eToro CEO Yoni Assia.      “The Saudi-Russia-U.S. competition on lowering the price of oil has added a lot of fire … some days [oil] is now the most traded asset on eToro,” Assia said. “There’s been a significant squeeze on the ability to purchase dollars. … There are liquidity issues but we’re still not at the point of 2008.”      Assia said overall activity on eToro is up in March, including cryptocurrency trades, with gold purchases in particular at an “all-time high.” These traders bought $7.4 billion worth of gold in the first week of March alone, he said. While retail investors have increasingly turned to bitcoin, the volume they’re moving during the downturn is nothing compared to activity associated with other hard assets.      Read more: Retail Investors Are Buying the Bitcoin Institutions Are Selling, Traders Say      “Gold price and flow is determined by the real rate of interest,” Roy Sebag, founder of precious metals custody firm Goldmoney, said, adding that Russian gold markets are impacted differently because they don’t rely on dollars. “The [U.S.] Federal Reserve completely changed the rules – the real rate of interest [including inflation] swung even more into the negative and so we are seeing all that savings flow into gold immediately.”      Rumors abound that institutions are short on physical assets like gold. Sebag said the coronavirus crisis has shut down precious-metal mints, refineries and mines, leading to high premiums on small units.      ""Traders are looking for small denominations of gold, which are becoming more and more difficult to find,” Sebag said. Issuers of gold-backed stablecoins, like Paxos, are also seeing increased demand.      Even with bitcoin trading up among retail investors, it hasn’t translated to stronger bitcoin use among retailers. According to BlueWallet co-founder Nuno Coelho, Lightning Network payments have been steadily decreasing over the past year. Channel capacity peaked in May 2019.      This may leave bitcoin languishing, stuck between niche commercial rails and a lack of large-scale users.      “The hype about Lightning is gone,” Coelho said. “It’s time to focus on building the protocol and prove that Lightning can be a payments layer on top of Bitcoin. At the moment that is not clear yet.”      Some critics are questioning whether the grandfather cryptocurrency will eventually be the settlement layer some institutions hoped for – especially if CBDCs gain a foothold.    CBDC stimulus    The U.S. Congress is already in talks about issuing a “Digital Dollar,” which might in some ways be comparable to China’s CBDC plans.      That’s why Michael Sung, a professor at Shanghai's Fudan University, said he expects the coronavirus crisis to “accelerate” Chinese CBDC initiatives.      Read more: US Senate Floats ‘Digital Dollar’ Bill After House Scrubs Term From Coronavirus Relief Plan      “This would be the proper way to deploy the CBDC in China, it would be a stimulus,” Sung said. “The [Chinese] government has already indicated digital currency is not meant to do large settlements.”      The Chinese government’s approach to digital settlements is especially relevant considering it is home to the majority of bitcoin mining farms and manufacturers. Russia comes in at a distant second, a nation that has also taken a favorable approach toward CBDCs and a restrictive one toward bitcoin.      Governments could issue digital assets without the restraints of physical shipments or reserves, which both Eastern superpowers are also shoring up. China is, after all, both the world’s top gold producer and consumer. Some analysts believe the adjustable CBDC would offer a complementary catalyst to tangible reserves.      “There’s a massive shift to fintech,” Sung said. “This will lead to a mass digitization.”      On Tuesday, Chinese news outlet Global Times reported the People's Bank of China (PBoC) is now drafting laws to pave the way for CBDC circulation. Tony Tong, co-chairman of the Hong Kong Blockchain Association, agreed the current crisis may hasten such efforts and reduce the government’s reliance on physical cash.      Fudan University’s Sung said he expects to see such developments before 2021.      “Bitcoin was supposed to be the digital gold,” Sung said. “But there are all sorts of weird dynamics where it’s now unclear if bitcoin has that privileged status as a flight to safety.”      Will Foxley contributed reporting.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | FIAT,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/26/geopolitical-crisis-may-benefit-oil-gold-and-cbdcs-not-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/164c4941a49ed58af1ab555ec731a9b042b2749f-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404298,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhoD6,1585247632,Miners Are Selling More Bitcoin Than They Are Mining,"While bitcoin (BTC) looks set to prolong its recent bullish moves, those responsible for making new bitcoin have increased their selling.      The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value rose from $3,867 to $7,000 in the 13 days to March 25, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. Yet, throughout the 81 percent recovery rally, miners sold more coins than what they generated, according to the miner's rolling inventory (MRI) figure, a measure created by crypto data company ByteTree to track the changes in inventory levels held by miners.       The 21-day rolling MRI stayed above 100 during the entire duration of the recent recovery from lows below $4,000. An MRI above 100 means miners are selling more than they mine and running down inventory, while a below-100 MRI reading indicates miners are amassing inventory by selling less than they mine.      Because prices continued to go up, there was more than enough appetite for the bitcoin the miners fed the market.      See also: Bitcoin Is a Safe Haven for a Worse Storm Than This      Mining pools account for the highest percentage of bitcoin flowing into exchanges and have significant influence on prices. Yet, some view the market’s reaction as a positive indicator.      “When the price of bitcoin can rally sharply from the local lows and buyers can absorb the extra bitcoin sold by the miners with little impact, it is a sign of strength in the overall market,"" Connor Abendschein, crypto research analyst at Digital Assets Data told CoinDesk.      Miners also ran down inventory on Wednesday, as noted by ByteTree founder and Chairman Charlie Morris.      “Miners sold 2,788 against 1,588 mined, slamming the market, yet the market takes it. This is bullish,” Morris tweeted during Wednesday’s European trading hours. The cryptocurrency dropped from $6,700 to $6,500 during the Asian session, possibly on miner selling, but reversed losses later in the day.      Other analysts, however, are of the opinion that one-day variances in net miner sales are often too small to make a valid judgement of the bullishness of the market.      “Wednesday’s sell volume of 2,788 wasn’t statistically significant enough to have much meaning on the larger bitcoin price movements.” said Alexander S. Blum, COO at fintech company Two Prime. “Compared to the amount of Bitcoins in the world, the miner sales were less than 1 percent,”      Yet because miners on average have sold more coins during the price recovery, it may be indicative of underlying market strength. To put it another way, the price rally looks to have legs.      See also: Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Posts Second-Biggest Percentage Drop in Its History      Nonetheless, the cryptocurrency remains vulnerable to bouts of risk aversion in traditional markets. Global equities have regained some poise over the past couple of days, mainly due to the massive fiscal and monetary stimulus unveiled by the U.S.      The coronavirus outbreak, however, is showing no signs of slowing down and markets are yet to get a true sense of the economic damage, which could be far bigger than what’s widely forecasted. For example, the U.S. initial jobless claims soared past three million in the week ending March 21, double economists’ expectations for 1.5 million new claims.      Not surprisingly, that has some expected dire predictions from certain corners of the market.      “If you think what's happening now is the economic crisis, you're wrong,” renowned gold bug (and crypto skeptic) Peter Schiff tweeted early Thursday. “This is the health crisis. The economic crisis is the one that follows, and will result from the fiscal and monetary cure. The crisis will not just be worse than the Great Recession, but the Great Depression.”      “We must remain cautious for another liquidity crisis,” Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank told CoinDesk.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/26/miners-are-selling-more-bitcoin-than-they-are-mining,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/669b65ebd545fe6cb18e4459a85d21a928c6effe-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404299,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhoF4,1585242047,Gold-Backed Stablecoins Race to Keep Up With Crisis-Driven Demand,"Gold-backed crypto tokens continue to rise in price as sourcing gold itself during the coronavirus-induced downturn is reportedly getting more difficult.      Demand for Paxos Gold (PAXG) and Tether Gold (XAUT), two of the most liquid gold-backed token projects, has surged this week. Both blockchain-backed tokens each represent a legal entitlement to one ounce of gold stored in institutional vaults. Both tokens are redeemable for physical gold.      The uptick in demand comes as traditional gold suppliers face shortages and difficulties in bringing physical bullion to the market, according to reports.      “The Fed completely changed the rules – the real rate of interest swung even more and so we are seeing all that money flow into gold immediately,” Roy Sebag, founder of metals custodian Goldmoney, said regarding the Federal Reserve in a phone interview with CoinDesk on Tuesday.      Read more: Bitcoin and Gold: Evaluating Hard-Cap Currencies in Times of Financial Crisis      Purchases of new PAXG – which represent one ounce of London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) institutional-grade gold – have nearly doubled day-over-day since Monday, according to Paxos spokesperson Becky McClain. Paxos said Thursday it had enough gold to cover current volumes.      On the other hand, demand for Tether’s offering led to the XAUT market cap hitting $50 million on Wednesday, according to data provider Nomics. Yet supply-chain issues in sourcing the gold itself could hinder further issuance of the token, according to The Block.      “XAUT simply represents a new and technologically innovative way for people to hold gold without annual fees,” Tether told CoinDesk in a statement, declining to comment on daily market movements. “We have seen strong growth for XAUT and we anticipate XAUT will continue to grow as it establishes itself as the dominant digital token representing gold ownership.”      Trade volume for both tokens has also increased in recent days, according to market data from Nomics and CoinMarketCap.      “We’ve all seen unprecedented volatility in the markets the past few weeks, so naturally people are looking to safe havens like gold,” Paxos executive Walter Hessert told CoinDesk. “As a blockchain-based token, it also offers holders the greatest level of control and accessibility outside the financial system.”    Price premium      An increase in demand for physical gold paired with supply chain issues for sourcing the precious metal has increased the price per ounce.      Bloomberg reported earlier this week the price of gold futures spiked against the price of gold in a premium not seen in over 40 years due to the inability to settle contracts physically in New York City as COVID-19 spreads.      Gold-backed crypto tokens currently hold a premium for traditional trading of both spot and futures gold markets on exchanges such as FTX. However, current prices could be a continuation of past premiums held by gold-backed tokens, according to CoinDesk Research.      Indeed, PAXG and XAUT have consistently held above the spot price of gold since their inceptions. XAUT launched in January 2020; PAXG launched in September 2019.

Not a lack of physical gold, but denomination problems,” Sebag said. “Definitely a shortage.”      Paxos said the increased demand for PAXG is not leading to the supply constraints reportedly seen by Tether.  “We're only dealing with London LBMA gold, and there is plenty of metal there!

42404280,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhnyL,1585241284,Bitcoin Is a Safe Haven for a Worse Storm Than This,"Byrne Hobart, a CoinDesk columnist, is an investor, consultant and writer in New York. His newsletter, The Diff (diff.substack.com) covers inflection points in finance and technology.      Bitcoin (BTC) was designed for many reasons, but one of the most important was to be a safe-haven asset during times of financial distress. From the genesis block’s coinbase parameter (“The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks”) to today, bitcoin’s fans have treated it as something worth owning when the market goes crazy.      So it’s disappointing, to say the least, that after the fastest market rout in recent history, an asset built to be a safe haven … dropped 31 percent while the S&P dropped by a quarter. The daily correlation between the S&P and bitcoin went from slightly negative in February to 0.6 in March. Bitcoin barely responded to the Federal Reserve cutting rates to zero, and shrugged off other monetary interventions.      See also: As This Crisis Worsens, Bitcoin Will Become a Safe Haven Again      This is painful to anyone who owns bitcoin, especially to anyone who bought it as a hedge against exactly this kind of sell-off, and exactly this kind of central bank response. The money printer went brrr, and yet the store-of-value lost value.      What’s going on?      When we talk about safe-haven assets, we’re really talking about three different kinds of assets, for three kinds of scenarios:      Safer versions of risky bets, of the sort you’d invest in to hedge against a mild recession. These might include less-levered companies in a given industry, high-margin companies, corporate bonds rather than equities or any investment in a consumer staples company. When the economy shrinks, it’s bad news for companies in the champagne and luxury hotel business, but doesn’t really dent sales of toothpaste and canned food.      Assets people borrow during good times: Yen and U.S. Treasurys are classic safe assets, in part because investors borrow them to make other bets. If you buy a 10-year corporate bond, you’re making a bet on the creditworthiness of the company, and a bet on interest rates. Most of the people who are good at credit analysis are not experts in predicting the future course of monetary policy, so many of them buy the corporate bonds and bet against Treasurys of the same maturity to control their interest rate risk.    It’s not the safe haven for this particular kind of crisis.    The yen is a similar case: Since yen rates have been so low for so long, a classic forex trade is to borrow yen and invest in a currency with higher rates. In both cases, when the trade unwinds –when you sell your corporate bond or close out your bet on the Turkish lira or the South African rand, you end up buying the safe asset. Anything boring and borrowable goes up in price in response to bad news.      Things you want to own if the world is about to end. The best way to illustrate this is with a story: The financier Felix Rohatyn grew up in France in the 1930s. When Germany invaded, his family fled — they had enough time to pack their bags, but they lost almost everything. He recalled his parents putting gold coins in tubes of toothpaste before leaving. Everything else they owned, they left behind. If you’re living through a moment that’s going to be in the history books, the only assets you can take with you are the ones in your head or the ones you can smuggle out. (A USB drive, conveniently, fits into a variety of toiletry containers.)      One interpretation of bitcoin’s price performance during the COVID-19 crisis is that it wasn’t such a safe haven after all. But another is that it’s not the safe haven for this particular kind of crisis. The math of epidemics and immunity is such that, however bad they are, they eventually burn themselves out given a low mutation rate. Once the percentage of the population that has been infected is greater than 1 / R0, cases begin to fall even in the absence of countermeasures. With a case fatality rate of 2 percent, that’s an extraordinarily painful process to go through, and it ends up being a disaster for humanity on a historic scale.      See also: Why Bitcoin’s Safe-Haven Narrative Has Flown Out the Window      An intense disaster, but not one that lasts forever. The 1957-58 flu pandemic may have led to the sharpest postwar recession in U.S. history (at least as of Q4 2019), but the subsequent recovery was equally swift.      Right now, that’s how most investors are thinking. Whether they think COVID-19 is overblown or underblown, they still think of it as a temporary problem from which we’ll recover in short order. In fact, the very bailouts that Satoshi referenced in the Genesis block point to an argument in favor of the recovery consensus. Conventional wisdom among investors and policymakers today is the government didn’t react fast enough in 2008 to forestall a deflationary spiral. This time around, central banks are moving fast to supply cheap capital to financial institutions. In that scenario, governments and economies don’t collapse, and nobody has to flee their home hours ahead of disaster.      They do, however, need to scramble for dollars to service debts, so they’ll sell anything – stocks, bonds, real estate, crypto – and convert it into an asset they can use to pay the bills.      Bitcoin’s drop doesn’t disprove the safe haven argument. It just shows us bitcoin is designed to be a safe haven from a worse storm.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Byrne Hobart,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/26/bitcoin-is-a-safe-haven-for-a-worse-storm-than-this,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3a1814699d512dab019e15b5d5699032b9f0285f-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

On March 23, Wright filed his objection with the U.S. District Court of Southern Florida in an ongoing case brought by Ira Kleiman, brother of the late David Kleiman who was a former business partner of Craig Wright.      Wrightsaid the order ""erroneously disregarded the attorney-client relationship"" between the defendant (Wright) and his attorney, based on ""preconceived conclusions of the defendant's character.""      The case hinges upon whether Wright can prove his ownership of 1.1 million bitcoin (worth around $7.5 billion) held in the so called ""Tulip Trust"" – a massive encrypted trove allegedly mined with Kleiman. The Kleiman estate is suing Wright for half the bitcoin as well as intellectual property.      After a mysterious ""bonded courier"" failed to arrive with the keys early in 2020, Wright told the court he is unable to prove his access to the trust due to attorney-client privilege.      Earlier this month, presiding District Magistrate Bruce Reinhart dismissed Wright's argument and apparently questioned the lawyer's existence.      According to a March 9 filing, Wright had presented a declaration stating: “I am lawyer [sic] and obtained my bachelor of law degree in 2007 from Moi University in Kenya.” Reinhart said he also introduced ""a printout of a LinkedIn profile that reflects Mr. Mayaka having a Bachelor of Laws degree from Moi University,"" and asserted that Mayaka is counsel to the trust.

According to Wright, the latest order ""improperly relied on prior conclusions about [the] defendant that were unrelated to the existence of an attorney-client relationship and, in so doing, ignored the fundamental and bedrock principle of our legal system.""

Cho Ju-bin, 25, is said to have charged users anywhere between 200,000 to 1.5 million Korean won (around $160 to $1,200) to access images and videos of women, many younger than 16, who were forced to perform sex acts on themselves.      An investigation from CoinDesk Korea found Cho primarily dealt in the privacy-enhancing cryptocurrency monero (XMR) so he could cover his tracks.      Korean authorities took the unusual step Wednesday of publicly naming Cho as the alleged ringleader of a Telegram chat group known as the Doctor's Room, following a petition signed by more than five million South Koreans. He stands accused of violating the child protection, privacy and sexual abuse acts, as well as charges surrounding abuse, blackmail and threatening others.      Following a Supreme Court case in 2018, cryptocurrencies are considered a form of property subject to forfeit after conviction in South Korea.      But there are complications. Authorities have to find the wallets in which digital assets are stored, as well as the private key to access them. ""We may say that Mr. Cho has forgotten his private key,"" said Han Seo-hee, a Korean lawyer, to CoinDesk Korea. ""If I refuse to submit it, there is no way to force it [from him].""      Although CoinDesk Korea has been able to show Cho received more than 8,800 ether (ETH), currently worth around $1.2 million, from more than 500 wallets from around the world, the majority of his payments were in monero.      Unlike other cryptocurrencies, where transactions can readily be viewed on a public blockchain, monero jumbles them together, making it next to impossible for third parties to trace payments. Even the amount he received may never be known without his cooperation.      Cho is accused of blackmailing at least 58 women and 16 girls to send degrading and sexually exploitative images of themselves, forcing many to carve 'slave' into their bodies. He operated multiple rooms on Telegram, with users paying extra to view more graphic or extreme material. Korean authorities have also arrested 124 suspects and 18 operators linked to the case.      “I apologize to those who were hurt by me,” Cho said following his public reveal Wednesday. “Thank you for ending the life of a demon that I couldn’t stop.”      Cho did not respond to questions from reporters on whether he had admitted to the charges.",NEGATIVE,ETH | XMR,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | XMR,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/03/26/alleged-mastermind-of-sex-abuse-chatrooms-hid-payments-with-privacy-coin-monero,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d52e74980e60662175a8497273223639bc1c58c4-1500x820.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404261,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhm5G,1585225200,We Won't Ever Think About the Financial System the Same Way,"Lex Sokolin, a CoinDesk columnist, is Global Fintech co-head at ConsenSys, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based blockchain software company. The following is adapted from his Future of Finance newsletter.      For the first time in a long while, I find myself speechless.      This writing was always about the creativity of entrepreneurs in the face of a monolith. That monolith was the financial incumbents. That innovation was human ingenuity across AI, blockchain and digital experiences, working on beautiful progress in the face of rational skepticism.      Today, we just need the monolith to stand. And we need the entrepreneurs to endure to come back another day.      See also: Why the US’ $2 Trillion Stimulus, Unlimited QE Will Expose the Monetary System’s Flaws      Right now, nobody is thinking clearly. There may be plans and math and bailouts. We have made a global choice – save lives, burn the bridges. Like the Russians retreating into the frozen country from Napoleon, destroying stocks and supplies along their way to starve the French, we are hunkering down in isolation to starve the coronovirus. As if a virus cares for this logic.      To save our lives, we have had to sacrifice our economic heart – the one that brings food, community, employment and other sustenance to billions. There was no choice. It is worth pausing on the strata of this impact.      First, we have the individual. Individuals produce and consume. Most produce, that is, add to GDP as employees of companies. They consume largely based on income and wealth levels. Let's do a quick back-of-the-envelope. Of the 330 million people in the US, 160 million people are in the labor force. There are eight million households with children under the age of 3, another 10 million households with children under the age of 5, 15 million under the age of 11, and another 15 under the age of 17 (source). So that's about 45 million households who are now at home with kids, and I'll just assume that one parent in the household is no longer able to work.    To save our lives, we have had to sacrifice our economic heart.    Let's simplify and say 40 million people out of 160 million people will exit the labor force for the time of contagion. In the case of a three month quarantine, we have just created 25 percent unemployment for 25 percent of the year, ignoring all the associated friction costs. Unemployment claims per week are already higher than in 2008.      U.S. GDP is about $20 trillion per year. Cut that by 25 percent, and you get $4 trillion. This is why the congressional rescue package is in the $2 trillion range, and not the smaller billion-sized actions that were previously considered. Even if you redirect $2 trillion into supporting consumer spending and making sure people have some type of safety net, there are existential complications.      See also: Lex Solkolin - Libra Wanted a Currency, All We Need Are DeFi’s Open Payment Rails      For example, where would those $2 trillion have gone instead? Likely lower priority projects, like building the best ICBM, but jobs are on the line no matter what. If you just print the money, you devalue the purchasing power of existing money, and just re-distribute the losses politically. That may still be our best answer.      The fiscal stimulus is not the only thing we need, and the follow-on effects on the markets can again create systemic peril. To that end, we should pay close attention to the actions of the Federal Reserve. As of Monday, it planned to create a repurchase program for $500 billion of Treasurys and $200 billion of mortgage backed securities. This already happened in 2008 as a backstop to souring financial instruments.      More notable is the Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility and the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility to support the bond markets. This program could allow the Fed to be a direct underwriter in primary issuance, as well as a liquidity provider in a secondary market. Put simply – if you are Walmart, you can borrow from the Fed. Or if your Walmart $100 million bond comes due, you can refinance it. The key is that instead of enabling banks to do this activity, the Fed is taking on the account.    The Fed is lending to industry, side stepping banking infrastructure to make a faster, direct impact. This opens up an uncharted path for CBDCs.    One argument against Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) that we often hear is governments do not want to be the entity providing financial accounts to businesses and consumers. This would wipe out parts of the banking industry. It would also turn finance into a version of the Post Office. Such logic implies instead that banks should sponsor accounts, and governments should back the banks. But now is a crazy time!      The Fed is lending to industry, side stepping banking infrastructure to make a faster, direct impact. This opens up an uncharted path for CBDCs, especially as they relate to institutions. And if we have sovereign-backed blockchain networks, I would expect to see the rest of tokenized and decentralized finance eventually being ported over to connect to that infrastructure. It's a small silver lining, but I won't turn away even small rays of the Sun.      Once we have some semblance of normalcy and have regained control over the pandemic, there is still the question of what remains. Moscow was burned for Napoleon so that no food was left, and his armies starved and froze. Will our industry be similarly ravaged? The key question in my mind is about small businesses and startups. According to JP Morgan, the average business has 27 days of cash on hand, before it defaults and dies.      See also: Lex Sokolin - Software Ate the World, Here’s How It Eats Finance      They are all dead in a month. The quarantine wipes all of them out.      Somebody has to take it on the chin instead. Somebody has to take a haircut on their wealth to maintain employment, small business, and retirees. The world's balance sheet needs to be written down 10 percent, 20 percent, 30 percent, and more. The landlord who is expecting rent from the coffee shop is going to extract rent until the coffee shop goes belly up (which is soon), and then the landlord itself will start to accrue losses. Why is this a problem? Because the landlord is in debt too.      What looked like 35 percent debt to market ratios (i.e.., $35 of debt for every $100 of value) will look like 50 percent ratios (i.e., $35 of debt on the new $60 market value). Investors accrued lots of debt because it was cheap, and that also made market prices go up, since everything was easy to finance.      Do you think people will want to pay rent on commercial real estate or work from home on Zoom? This is why SoftBank is backing out of trying to rescue WeWork, opting instead to save the $3 billion+ of capital.      So naturally, the buck stops with the banks. The banks will be forced to suspend interest accruals and payments on debt, meaning narrow profitability will tank. They will have to write down the value of their collateral, and risk not holding enough regulatory capital. They will need to lower leverage and deal with the chance of bank runs, as people withdraw money to afford living their daily lives.      See also: The Overton Window Opens for a Digital Dollar      But remember that banks are mandated by government to have certain amounts of capital, and to underwrite risks of only a certain quality, and that their liquidity and credit provision is what makes the financial world go around. If it were your money, would you lend to your neighborhood coffee shop with a fat rent check and an indefinite pandemic threat?      No, you wouldn't.      By now, what you are hopefully seeing is that the entire system is closely interwoven. People, small businesses, large institutions, banks, governments -- you can't squirrel away the damage caused by the coming recession and market destruction. You can only redistribute it, and prioritize it.    You cannot delegate entrepreneurship, kindness, and trust to the State, the Federal Reserve, Goldman Sachs, Facebook, the European Union, or the world's governments.    To do that we need principles, vision and strength. We need to know what is important to us and the nation, and what our people's true beliefs really are. We need to have healthy governance, trust in the elected body and a spirit of neighborhood.      I don't see how we will get there in time. What we will get out of this crisis, however, is a new system of beliefs. I remember going through 2008, working at Lehman at the time and standing at the skyscraper window the weekend when everything fell apart. It tooks years after that moment, but my own view of the infallibility of our institutions evaporated away. That feeling, that there is nobody there as a backstop you can really trust, was liberating. It means that you might as well do it yourself.      Since 2008, many fintech vectors have been working on empowering people to have this ability. We can create decentralized networks according to need. We can move money and assets without ever touching a commercial enterprise. We can exchange information, data, and technology seamlessly.      This has been recently blocked by (1) the need for venture exits, creating behemoth messes of B2C companies and (2) stubborn regulation that enforces a world where protecting the consumer results in protecting the most conservative banks. Both of these barriers will soon shatter.      I hope that very many people will learn this lesson from the pandemic. You cannot delegate entrepreneurship, kindness, and trust to the State, the Federal Reserve, Goldman Sachs, Facebook, the European Union or the world's governments. Yes, they have a burden to bear in saving us from calamity. They will do it with bureaucracy and power trading, saving themselves first. We have to save ourselves, so let's do it with grace.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Lex Sokolin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/26/we-wont-ever-think-about-the-financial-system-the-same-way,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0227ca7444aa7ee545dbf88109f30502875cd909-1500x944.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404274,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhmE7,1585224339,Bitcoin in Rangebound Trading as Equity Markets Fail to See Stimulus Boost,"View  Wednesday's indecisive ""spinning top"" candle has neutralized the short-term bullish view. The cryptocurrency remains at the mercy of the sentiment in the traditional markets in the short term.  A rising channel breakdown on the four-hour chart would bring deeper losses toward $6,000. That may happen if the risk-off tone in the equity markets worsens on the back of dismal U.S. economic data.  A move above $7,000 is needed to restore the immediate bullish bias.    The bitcoin (BTC) market is looking pensive as global equities fail to respond positively to the U.S. Senate's approval of a massive coronavirus stimulus package.      The top cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading around $6,650, having witnessed two-way business in $6,500-$7,000 range in the last 24 hours, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      Meanwhile, futures tied to the S&P 500 are down nearly 1 percent at press time, and major equity indices in Europe like Germany's DAX and U.K.'s FTSE 100 have shed 1 percent – possibly taking cues from the Asian equities, which put in a negative performance.      Markets still look risk averse, even though globally a number of monetary and fiscal lifelines have been extended to stem the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak.      See also: We Won’t Ever Think About the Financial System the Same Way      The biggest of the lot is the $2 trillion coronavirus package approved by the U.S. Senate early on Thursday. The legislative package includes $500 billion for U.S. companies, $350 billion for small businesses, $250 billion in federal unemployment benefits and $300 billion in direct payments to most U.S. citizens.      The largest economic bill in U.S. history follows the Federal Reserve's open-ended asset purchase program and zero interest rate policy known as quantitative easing. It seems generally accepted by now that the unprecedented stimulus could bode well for bitcoin in the longer term.      ""There is a growing consensus within the community that due to the Fed announcing unlimited QE, investors could soon be looking to BTC as an inflation hedge against a depreciating dollar. Coupled with the upcoming halving, we could see some really positive moves over the medium to long term,"" Nemo Qin, an analyst at eToro, told CoinDesk.      Qin expects prices to retest $7,000 again and break higher convincingly. So far, however, buyers have been trading cautiously.      The U.S. Department of Labor is scheduled to publish the initial jobless claims for the week ended March 20 at 12:30 UTC today. Jobless claims are forecast to rise sharply to one million from the preceding week's 281,000. Risk aversion could worsen if these numbers turn out significantly higher than expected, in which case bitcoin could come under pressure, too.      ""For bitcoin, the downside risk is another aggressive sell-off across all markets due to coronavirus,"" Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank, told CoinDesk.      From a technical perspective, bitcoin's recovery rally looks to have stalled and prices could suffer if support at $6,460 is breached.    Daily chart    Bitcoin created a spinning-top candle Wednesday. These occur when prices swing both ways, but close the day with moderate gains or losses. The long wicks and the small body are reflective of indecision in the market place.      See also: Bitcoin Halving, Explained      In this case, however, the candle has appeared following a notable rise from a low of $3,867 on March 13 to $7,000 and represents bull fatigue.      As a result, the short-term bullish bias stands neutralized.    4-hour chart    Bitcoin remains trapped in an ascending channel. A break below the lower end, currently at $6,476, would imply an end of the rally from recent lows under $4,000 and shift risk in favor of a drop to $6,000.      On the higher side, a convincing move above $7,000 is needed to revive the bullish case and open the doors to stronger gains toward $7,500.

That's been true the past few weeks as well.”      Bitcoin’s (BTC) seizure-resistant technology makes it impossible to transfer without the consent of someone holding a private key. If bitcoin is to be money, it needs infrastructure to handle assets when life’s prevailing circumstances alter one’s plans, such as a medical accident or death.      Read more: How to Protect Bitcoin for Your Heirs With the Push of a ‘Dead Man’s Button’      Casa CEO Nick Neuman said half of recent inbound sales prospects have specifically asked about the firm’s inheritance service, Casa Covenant.      The firm – which focuses on user-friendly private key storage solutions – has had three times the number of clients in the first three weeks of March than January and February combined for its Diamond class product, which includes the inheritance wallet service, Neuman said.      Casa is looking to add the feature to its first- and second-tier services, Gold and Platinum, soon, he added.      “We allow clients to hold their own private keys and securely pass their bitcoin on to their heirs in the case that doing so is necessary so that clients don't ever have to relinquish control of their bitcoin to a third party,” Neuman said.    Not just bitcoin    Meanwhile, the outbreak has strengthened Ethereum developers’ motivation to create similar infrastructure for Bitcoin’s top competitor.      Even before coronavirus became a household name, the Alfred project at Denver’s Ethereum hackathon was building a suite of tools for transferring tokens under the ERC-20 and ERC-721 non-fungible token (NFT) standards.      Project member Seth Goldfarb said the team chose the name Alfred to put a kind face on an uncomfortable topic.      Read more: Casa Is Helping Bitcoin Investors Pass on Their Holdings When They Die      From a technical perspective, the system would have two parts: an oracle service regularly scanning public sources for death announcements, and an escrow service, Goldfarb said.      When the oracle detects a subscriber’s death, the escrow system would begin a countdown to sending the user’s digital assets to a chosen third party such as a family member. A “life alert” button could stop the escrow service from going through if needed, Goldfarb said. For now, the project remains in the development stage, however.      While an unsavory topic, inheritance protocols are a necessary part of the tech stack if digital assets are to endure, particularly if they rise in value.      “It’s not nice to think about, but it may [be] prudent to have a detailed plan for what will happen to your Bitcoin when you die,” Lightning Labs engineer Alex Bosworth said on Twitter.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/03/26/bitcoin-firms-report-uptick-in-demand-for-inheritance-services,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b2aa1bc5842ee49aff436e11798ea7a695a452ba-1200x873.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Brave announced Tuesday it was partnering with Binance to develop an in-browser crypto trading tool that will ultimately let users deposit, swap, purchase and trade crypto right from Brave Browser’s launch and new tab windows. There, a natively-integrated crypto widget executes actions via Binance and Binance.US, depending on the user’s country.      Most of those features are not functional at launch, CoinDesk found. The widget is only accessible on Brave’s “Nightly” developer-stage browser, and as of Wednesday afternoon it is limited to booting up purchase orders through the Binance Fiat Gateway. Brave said a wider release is expected in April.      Brave’s CEO Brendan Eich declined to disclose the terms of the deal.      “Adding a widget that seamlessly helps users acquire and trade crypto is a natural evolution of our features,” Eich told CoinDesk. He said the “crypto-savvy” user base has been “clamoring” for a trade function to go along with Brave’s existing ethereum wallet.      See also: The Overton Window Opens for a Digital Dollar      Brave is working on mobile wallets and plans to expand it to other blockchains, he said.      Brave has been courting the crypto community for much of its existence as a privacy-centric alternative to other, more popular browser services. In 2017, it ran a $35 million ICO for its ERC-20 “Basic Attention Tokens,” now the backbone for the Brave Rewards ad views compensation system.      The addition of a trading tool puts Brave more squarely in the race with other crypto-focused browsers, like Opera, which holds over 2 percent market share according to statcounter (Brave’s privacy functions make it difficult to measure its slice of the pie).

The Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) called out the “COINMALEX” and “Crypto Foxtrades” crypto exchanges in twin warnings Wednesday. Both entities had claimed to be licensed, registered or domiciled in Malta, all of which MFSA denied.      COINMALEX’s “about” page features a document purporting to be from the “Malta Business Registry,” a real institution within the small European island state. The document’s letterhead prominently displays the British royal coat of arms. Malta ceased using that icon when it gained independence from Britain in 1964.      Crypto Foxtrades’ “about us” page is more forthright about its alleged Malta ties. It claims to be “licensed and regulated as a Category 3 Investment Services provider by the Malta Financial Services Authority.” That is a real category, however MFSA insisted that Crypto Foxtrades is not licensed under it.      See also: Bitcoin Firms Report Uptick in Demand for Inheritance Services      “The MFSA wishes to alert the public, in Malta and abroad, that Crypto Foxtrades is NOT a Maltese registered Company NOR licenced or otherwise authorised by the MFSA to provide the service of an exchange or other financial services which are required to be licenced or otherwise authorised under Maltese law,” MFSA said.      MFSA released a similar statement for COINMALEX.      Crypto Foxtrades and COINMALEX did not immediately respond to requests for comment.      MFSA has been closely policing allegedly Maltese crypto businesses since 2018, issuing warnings wherever and whenever it spotted one claiming phony licensure.

42404256,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhm0L,1585193214,Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Posts Second-Biggest Percentage Drop in Its History,"A key measure of competition among Bitcoin miners just dropped by 15.95 percent – the second-largest decline in the network's history.      The drop in so-called mining difficulty signals some miners have bowed out of the ongoing race to solve math problems to win freshly minted bitcoin (BTC), as a decline in the cryptocurrency's price has made this activity less profitable. That said, the drop could work in favor for those who have chosen to stay in the game as less competition means individual miners would gain a bigger cut in Bitcoin's daily mining output.      The world's largest blockchain network by market capitalization adjusted its mining difficulty around 3:00 UTC on March 26 to 13.91 trillion (T), down from 16.55 T in the previous cycle recorded on March 9. Two weeks ago, bitcoin suffered its worst sell-off in seven years, and it has only partially recovered since.      Mining requires powerful, specialized computers that consume copious amounts of electricity, and these businesses typically pay those hefty bills by selling or borrowing against their bitcoin.      The price drop has erased all gains in Bitcoin's computing power from the last three months, pushing it back to the level seen around Dec. 20. The situation was weighing especially on mining operators that have been running with older equipment such as Bitmain's AntMiner S9 and other equivalent models.      The third-biggest drop in Bitcoin mining difficulty was 15.13 percent, recorded in December 2018 amid a price crash at the time. The largest difficulty percentage drop in Bitcoin history dates back to October 2011.      Bitcoin's mining difficulty is programmed to adjust itself every 2,016 blocks – which normally takes about 14 days – in order to keep the average block production interval at about 10 minutes.      See also: How Bitcoin Mining Works      When a sizable amount of computing power on the network has been switched off during a 14-day cycle, it increases the time for remaining miners to produce the 2,016 blocks. As such, the bitcoin network would make it less difficult to mine in the next cycle.      Similarly, if a significant amount of processing power has plugged into the network in any cycle, shortening the average block production interval, the network will increase its difficulty in the next cycle. As a result, individual miners would generate less bitcoin since competition has intensified.    Bad timing    What has worsened the situation for mining operators in the last 17 days is that mining difficulty had reached an all-time high on March 9 – just a few days before the March 12 price crash – and yet still more than two weeks away before it could adjust itself.      The recent price plunge, coupled with record mining competition at the time, had made more than two dozen old bitcoin mining models unable to generate daily profits in the past two weeks, according to data from mining pool f2pool, assuming electricity cost is at an average $0.05 per kilowatt-hour.      The total average computing power generated by all the mining equipment on the bitcoin network over the past two weeks has also declined from 118 exahashes per second (EH/s) in early March to now about 99 EH/s.      Chris Zhu, co-founder and COO of Chinese mining pool PoolIn said on March 12, following the price plunge, that he expected the network's hash rate to drop by 20 to 30 percent in the next weeks, based on the hash rate decline on several major mining pools at the time.      See also: Bitcoin Halving, Explained      And that has led to the increase of the average block production interval to nearly 12 minutes, subsequently prolonging the adjustment period to 17 days, meaning incumbent miner operators had to wait three more days than usual before they could mine more bitcoin while still having to pay electricity costs.      That said, with the significant mining difficulty drop in the current cycle and bitcoin's price bouncing back above $6,600, older mining equipment like Bitmain's AntMiner S9 is able to bring modest daily profits again, according to PoolIn's data.      Meanwhile, the latest and most powerful miners delivered by Bitmain, MicroBT and Canaan since late 2019 continue to generate profits as they boast a higher mining efficiency.      All of the three major mining equipment manufacturers have also been racing to deliver even more top-of-the-line mining machines in the coming months as bitcoin's halving event approaches, which will reduce the network's mining rewards per block from 12.5 to 6.25 bitcoin.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/26/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-posts-second-biggest-percentage-drop-in-its-history,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e5658a07a99b343135f6dad2b40c85fcef0db74f-1315x935.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
