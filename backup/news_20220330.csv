BTC which has had a tremendous rally during the first half of the week had been able to break out of the slump of the low $40,000s and moved on an upward trajectory above $47,500. However, perp traders have not reacted much to it given the state of the funding rates. Funding Rates Remain Flat The bitcoin perpetual traders are not reacting to the recent upside as expected. This is evidenced in the fact that the perp basis is still sitting at or even below neutral funding rates, marking the 115th consecutive day that this has remained the case. This speaks volumes to how perp traders are viewing the market. Regardless of the bitcoin price increase, they have not increased their activity in any significant way. BTC funding rates remain neutral amid price growth | Source: Arcane Research It could easily mean that perp traders are not convinced by the recent price movement. As with the previous uptrends recorded this year, it could mean that perp traders are expecting the digital asset to go the same way. However, this uptrend has differed from its predecessors given the fact that it has broken above the $45,000 resistance point and possesses the potential to climb towards $50K.

13400064,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=230478,1648679474,Is It Possible For DAOs to Democratize Fundraising?,"Entrepreneurs are starting to deploy their businesses and brands with government assistance or bootstrapping. Unfortunately, leaning on the government to back their invention is highly inconvenient due to strict restrictions. This is due to a long chain of command and a horrendous bureaucracy. On the other hand, several issues may constrain a bootstrapped startup. The most significant is a low budget and a smaller network of high-net-worth individuals. Despite their bumpy start in the late 1900s, innovation and unicorn startups have had the support of venture capital companies for several years. They do this by bypassing the constraints that come with asking the government for financing or trying to bootstrap a business. They could accomplish it by putting up a lot of capital in return for a lot of equity. On the other hand, Venture Capitalists (VCs) have their own set of problems that Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) might be able to tackle. The Challenges that Venture Capitalists Pose to Startups One common problem startup entrepreneurs face is a lack of faith in their idea because it is &apos;too far out there.&apos; Many people are reluctant to invest in a startup because they believe the money will be wasted on overhead. This is especially true for extremely inventive startups that most VCs find difficult to understand. Another major issue venture investors have with businesses is discouraging them from taking risks.

42374976,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw4hqT,1648679364,"First Mover Asia: India Continues Its Restrictive Approach to Crypto; Bitcoin, Ether Run in Place","Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin and ether run in place, but other major cryptos, including SOL, rose significantly.  Insights: India has not been the friendliest place for crypto lately; BC Technology Group maintains high hopes.  Technician's take: BTC buyers could remain active over the short term.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $46,957 -0.5%  Ether (ETH): $3,386 +0.4%  Top Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Solana SOL +8.0% Smart Contract Platform EOS EOS +3.1% Smart Contract Platform Ethereum Classic ETC +2.8% Smart Contract Platform  Top Losers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Internet Computer ICP −1.0% Computing Filecoin FIL −0.9% Computing Bitcoin BTC −0.8% Currency  Bitcoin and ether are flat  Bitcoin and ether spent another day running in place.  The two largest cryptos by market capitalization were roughly flat over the past 24 hours, bitcoin under $47,000, just below its frequent resting spot the past few days, and ether just under $3,400. It was the second consecutive day where prices of both moved little from where they stood the preceding day.  Most other major cryptos in the CoinDesk top 20 by market cap were in the green, a few significantly so. SOL and AVAX were up 7% and 5% at certainly points, respectively, and the meme token SHIB rose about 3%.  Crypto's checkered price performance came as Russia continued its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and new signs of a worsening global, economic environment.  Fueled by war-related increases in fuel prices and worsening supply chain problems, inflation soared in Germany and Spain to highs not seen in both countries since the 1980s. Spain's consumer price index rose to nearly 10%, jumping by more than two percentage points since February. Germany took an initial step toward natural gas rationing, which about half the population uses for heating.  The price of Brent crude, a widely considered measure of the energy market, hovered over $110 on Wednesday after dipping below $105 earlier in the week.  Oanda Americas senior analyst Edward Moya said that after a week of gains ""bitcoin's rally"" was ""taking a breather and that should remain the case as war concerns completely dominate the short-term fate for most risky assets.""  Moya was cautious about the asset's near-term future. ""Bitcoin needs a catalyst to make a run towards the $50,000 level, so for now it seems like it could consolidate between the $45,000 and $48,000 levels,"" he said.  Markets  S&P 500: 4,602 -0.6%  DJIA: 35,228 -0.1%  Nasdaq: 14,442 -1.2%  Gold: $1,934 +0.9%  Insights  India continues its crypto crackdown; BC Technology Group is Optimistic  As crypto goes, there are easier places to operate than India.  The country's tax authority announced on Monday that it had seized Rs. 95.86 crore (US$12.6 million) from 11 crypto exchanges on allegations of tax evasion.  CoinDesk had reported in January that the country's Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI), which oversees tax collection, had previously seized around Rs. 84 crore (about $11 million) in taxes and 1.1 crore ($145,000) in penalties. India’s Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary revised the amount to 95.86 crore ($12.6 million) in a statement.  The government said in January that it was investigating six exchanges, including India's largest exchanges, WazirX, CoinDCX and BuyUCoin, as part of an anti-tax evasion initiative, but Chaudhary updated the number.  The announcement comes a week after the government passed a finance bill that included a whopping 30% capital gains tax on crypto transactions and a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) and no offsetting losses. The vote ignored lobbying by industry advocates who had hoped to water down at least the source tax.  On Friday, April 1, crypto companies must begin paying the capital gains tax, with T1% tax deducted at the source as of July 1.  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government is still planning a rollout of a digital rupee by the end of 2022-23, seen as the cornerstone of the country's crypto policy. That approach is more cautious and in keeping with the Indian government's recent authoritarian leanings.  ***  HK’s BC Technology Group waits for regulators to catch up to Web 3  Hong Kong’s BC Technology Group, the parent of the city’s institutionally focused OSL exchange, saw its stock trend upwards as the market opened Wednesday following its strong earnings report.  During a Wednesday morning earnings call, company executives emphasized they still believe a regulated pool of capital provides the biggest opportunity in crypto because there remains a huge market of institutional traders that can’t yet touch anything not regulated.  This includes Web 3, decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFT), Wayne Trench, CEO of OSL, explained on the call.  “DeFi is amazing, but it’s hard for a regulated firm to trade in the DeFi market because of the lack of [anti-money laundering] controls,” he said.  But while the regulatory regime might inhibit some forms of market trading, it also opens up new opportunities. Regulated coin lending, for instance, is something that Coinbase (COIN) has struggled to navigate but regulators in Hong Kong have no problem with it – provided it stays within the closed regulatory loop of other professional investors.  The executive team also mentioned that although OSL is a regulated exchange closed to retail traders, the company does have retail exposure via DBS’s digital assets exchange, which runs on OSL’s software. During its last earnings, DBS said that it is planning to launch a retail exchange by year’s end.  Over the next six months (companies in Hong Kong report earnings bi-annually), all eyes will be on the stock of OSL’s parent company to see if investors are valuing its efforts.  The company is growing significantly by the numbers, and its stock has made some progress in small increments. But on the week it still underperforms bitcoin.  The gap narrowed on Wednesday, at least compared to a month ago, but it still exists. Six months later we’ll see if the market vindicates the company’s regulated-first approach.     Technician's take  Bitcoin Holding Support Above $46K; Resistance at $48K-$51K  Bitcoin (BTC) is attempting to break above a tight trading range between $46,000 and $48,000 as momentum remains positive.  Initial resistance is seen at the 200-day moving average, currently at $48,312, which could stall the price rally. Still, there is stronger resistance at $50,966, suggesting that buyers could remain active over the short term.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart ticked higher and is firmly in the overbought zone. Previous overbought signals, however, lasted for three months before a significant sell-off in price.

With CBDCs, that would be possible, he noted."" (CoinDesk Assistant Opinion Editor Daniel Kuhn) ... ""But the reaction to Larsen’s effort among industry leaders and observers has been disbelief and suspicion. That’s in part because, however warm and fuzzy Larsen’s goal seems to be, the campaign’s recommendations are extremely risky, thoroughly impractical and perhaps even nonsensical. More importantly, Larsen’s motives for the proposal are extremely suspect: After all, as a co-founder of Ripple, he has arguably spent the last decade in competition with Bitcoin.""

Chandler, a Phoenix suburb, on Wednesday said that residents can pay in bitcoin, ether and litecoin (LTC) held in their PayPal (PYPL) accounts. But the city won’t ever touch those coins; its utility payments processor Invoice Cloud will sell it all for fiat, a press release said.  City Council member Mark Stewart said in a press release that it’s important to serve residents with the newest technology, such as crypto payments. But it was unclear at press time whether anyone in the city of 250,000 had begun using the option.  Chandler is not the first U.S. city to mesh crypto payments with utilities. Mercedes, Texas, voted to research the subject in November, months after Williston, North Dakota, brought its offering online. Both are orders of magnitude smaller than Chandler, a city of over 273,000.  Chandler’s choice of PayPal means that bill payers can’t use their self-custodied coins.

13400065,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=230432,1648673123,Beginner’s Guide on Crypto-jacking!,"Crypto-jacking is a type of cybercrime. To mine bitcoin, cybercriminals hack people&apos;s devices (computers, cell phones, tablets, and even servers) over the internet. It is a threat that infects mobile phones, PCs, and laptops and uses the resources available to mine cryptocurrency. Large institutions, individual users, and industrial control systems are all targets for crypto-jacking. How Does Crypto-jacking Work? Hackers install crypto-jacking software for breaking into mobile phones and computers. Both mobile and desktop PCs are targets for crypto-jacking software. As a result, the hacker may be able to mine cryptocurrency without difficulty. Money is also stolen from cryptocurrency wallets. Cybercriminals use two ways to mine bitcoin on a user&apos;s PC or mobile device: Using JavaScript code that operates automatically after being loaded into the user&apos;s browser affects an online site or advertisement. A hacker sends a malicious link in the crypto mining code through email to the user&apos;s computer or mobile device. These two ways are the most commonly used by hackers for crypto mining since they allow them to earn the most profit. How Can You Detect Crypto-jacking? Crypto jacking&apos;s primary goal is to mine as many coins as possible while remaining undetected. However, some indicators might help you determine whether or not your computer is infected with crypto-jacking software. Here are several examples: The laptop is noisier and sl...",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/beginners-guide-on-crypto-jacking/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png
42374957,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw4hV5,1648672746,Bitcoiner Bruce Fenton Confirms He’s Running for New Hampshire Senate Seat,"The former executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation, Bruce Fenton, is officially running for the Republican nomination for New Hampshire’s seat in the U.S. Senate. He’ll be starting his campaign with an injection of $5 million of personal bitcoin (BTC) wealth.  Fenton’s announcement Wednesday confirmed earlier reports the long-time crypto proponent and self-described libertarian was flirting with the idea of a Senate run.  Incumbent Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) is widely unpopular with her constituents, making her seat vulnerable to a Republican challenger – and Fenton wants to throw his hat into the ring. Fenton told CoinDesk on Wednesday his initial $5 million contribution would be a loan to the campaign but that he would ""spend and raise whatever it takes.""  ""I think that the money system in politics is broken and ready for disruption so I think we can spend very effectively and get a lot more for our dollars,"" Fenton added.  As crypto becomes an increasingly hot topic on Capitol Hill, more federal lawmakers are aligning themselves with the crypto industry. Candidates that are seen as crypto-friendly have enjoyed support from crypto enthusiasts, an increasing number of whom are describing themselves as single-issue voters.  Fenton is a relative latecomer to the race, which means he faces a tougher fight in the primary election, which is slated for Sept. 13.  But despite the obstacles, Fenton told CoinDesk he felt compelled to try anyway.  “I knew this is something I had to do or I would regret it,” Fenton said. “I don’t know what change I can make in the world but I know I must try.”  “We are at a very special time in world history,” Fenton added. “Bitcoin and the crypto revolution is one key part of the major change we are seeing in how our systems work. I think our values of decentralization and freedom are about to change the world.”  If elected, Fenton previously told CoinDesk he wants to tear down regulatory obstacles for the crypto industry.  “I’m in favor of limiting government involvement in our lives as much as possible,” Fenton said. “Whether it’s crypto or any other issue, I believe government should reduce regulatory burdens and get out of our lives and wallets.”  Read more: Meet the Libertarian Bitcoiner Considering a Run for New Hampshire’s Senate Seat",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | REGULATION,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/30/bitcoiner-bruce-fenton-confirms-hes-running-for-new-hampshires-senate-seat,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0d9b60b66628a49747c89cb56dee5d761bc64ffe-455x455.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42420985,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXAow9,1648672607,Can Avalanche Win Over Wall Street and 'Degens' Alike?,"To the crypto-conscious, blockchain industry conferences have become annual pilgrimages of sorts, drawing each chain’s respective believers to multi-day extravaganzas in exotic locales around the world.  There’s the familiar Bitcoin conference (which appears to have found a home in Miami) and Ethereum’s long-running ETHDenver. Starting last autumn, new, billion-dollar base layers joined in, with Solana’s coming-out party, Breakpoint, held in Lisbon.  Now Avalanche has entered the fray, having just wrapped a six-day summit in Barcelona, Spain.  “This is the first time the developers, the users, the investors can all get together,” said John Wu, president of Ava Labs, the company that supports the Avalanche blockchain. “That was the goal.”  ‘Escape velocity’  In the past year, Avalanche has emerged from relative obscurity to become a major challenger to Ethereum, the incumbent leader among smart-contract compatible blockchains.  The AVAX token returned an eye-popping 2,800% last year, breaching the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. (This year, the token has fallen about 18%.) The total valued locked (TVL) on the chain’s decentralized finance (DeFi) apps soared past $10 billion for the first time in November. It currently sits at fourth on the TVL charts, behind Ethereum, Terra and Binance Smart Chain, but above Solana.  Even “normies” may have noticed Avalanche’s advertisements plastered across New York City subway cars, or the sea of red triangle emojis that its loyal users tout on social media.  “Avalanche has successfully reached escape velocity,” said Darryl Wang, a conference speaker and former investor at the Three Arrows Capital offshoot DeFiance Capital. “I moved from 100% Ethereum to most other EVM-compatible chains. Now, 90% of my transactions are on Avalanche.”  Avalanche is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), meaning applications that are built using the Ethereum programming language Solidity are also able to deploy on Avalanche with minimal tweaking from developers.  So far, EVM compatibility has proven to be catalytic for upstart base layers, with Polygon, Fantom and Avalanche all courting users who are fed up with Ethereum’s high transaction fees.  EVM compatibility may be losing its edge, however, with Terra and Solana – both unable to easily communicate with Ethereum – steadily climbing the TVL charts, a proxy for user mindshare. However, Avalanche leadership sees shared code as an advantage.  “Solana goes with the moat strategy,” Wu told CoinDesk in an interview in Barcelona, referring to the chain that is perhaps Avalanche’s biggest competitor. “We are purposely not doing that.”  Origin story  Even among the nascent, decade-old cryptocurrency industry, Avalanche’s arrival is particularly impressive – it was only founded in early 2020, making the $25 billion blockchain just over two years old.  Avalanche is the brainchild of Emin Gün Sirer, the Turkish-born computer scientist and ex-Cornell University professor who developed much of the technology behind Avalanche. Today, Gün Sirer serves as CEO of Ava Labs.  Perhaps most notable about Gün Sirer and the rest of Avalanche’s leaders is their institutional pedigree, particularly in an industry where teenagers, college dropouts and pseudonymous anons frequently carry outsized influence.  “They’re definitely more seasoned,” said Aave founder Stani Kulechov of the top brass at Ava Labs. “They run the Avalanche ecosystem in a very efficient way. They’re very mission-driven, while Ethereum is more values-driven.”  Wu, who boasts not one but two Ivy League degrees, says he first met Gün Sirer through Cornell, his undergraduate alma mater, where Sirer had been a long-time professor of computer science in distributed systems, the umbrella discipline of blockchain.  “I called up my undergrad and asked who are the best crypto people in the comp sci department,” Wu recalled. “They told me to talk to Gün.”  In 2017, the pair became advisers to the Cornell University Blockchain Club.  In crypto, founders frequently achieve deity-like status, with Bitcoin’s Satoshi Nakamoto, Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin, Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson and Terra’s Do Kwon being leading examples. While fewer have heard of Gün Sirer, he has been called “a huge celebrity” in his native Turkey.  “He’s a big reason why we decided to build on Avalanche,” said Mustafa Mercan, a conference attendee who, with his five-member team from The Hatch project, flew to Barcelona from Istanbul.  Institutions and degens alike  Avalanche has been playing a two-pronged strategy, courting both the institutions looking to dip a toe into crypto waters, and the decentralized finance (DeFi) degenerates chasing the next 1,000% APY Ponzi protocol.  In the conference’s opening remarks, Gün Sirer joked that there were both “highly credentialed” and “highly questionable” people in attendance, a nod to both the institutions and degens in the room.  Among the institutional crowd, conference attendees included traditional financial services companies such as Deloitte and Mastercard (MA). In the more degenerate camp, there were the remnants of Wonderland’s “Frog Nation” and rabid enthusiasts of the play-to-earn crab game, Crabada.  Perhaps the most “degen” scandal on Avalanche involved Wonderland, which grew to become one of the largest dapps on the chain before its CFO, the pseudonymous Twitter user @0xSifu, was revealed to be ex-Quadriga co-founder Michael Patryn.  “If you compare the number of Wonderland stuff on Avalanche with what’s happening on Solana or BSC, you’ll see a smaller percentage than on other chains,” Wu said when asked about the Wonderland snafu, perhaps Avalanche’s only major PR disaster in recent memory. Rumors swirled that Wonderland founder Daniele Sestagalli was told “not to come'' to Barcelona.  One power user told CoinDesk that Avalanche’s retail appeal comes from its robust community and ample opportunities to make money through Avalanche’s incentive programs.  “In general, the majority of the dapps on Avalanche are community-driven,” said Wang. “Solana is very [venture capital]-driven. If you bought a Solana token in Lisbon, you’re down bad – I guarantee it.”  Marketing Avalanche to both retail and institutional audiences has proven to be a balancing act for Ava Labs. “You talk to a degen and they’re, like, ‘You’re a Boomercoin,’” said Wu. “When you talk to someone in TradFi, they’re, like, ‘You’re so cutting-edge.’”  Among the conference attendees who spoke with CoinDesk, the institutional crowd appeared less passionate about Avalanche, or perhaps for professional reasons are bound to keeping poker faces. Many institutions admitted to collaborations with multiple layer 1, or base, blockchains as a way to hedge their bets in an industry where the winners still remain unclear.  “We’re technology agnostic,” Harold Bosse, head of product innovation at Mastercard, told CoinDesk in an interview. “We understand that there will be a multi-chain future.” Although he declined to comment on specific partnerships, Bosse said Mastercard was “very excited” to explore commercial use cases with Avalanche.  The crypto lending platform BlockFi echoed Mastercard’s “play the field” strategy. “We’re looking at a number of different layer 1 projects,” said BlockFi Global Head of Institutional Distribution David Olsson. “Given we need to effectively manage risk for our clients, we think it makes sense to explore not just one but several.”  Tekin Salimi, an ex-partner of Polychain Capital, a crypto venture capital firm that is very active in the Avalanche ecosystem, sees the crypto space as inherently “more collaborative” than traditional finance.  “It’s more like we are inventing a whole new asset class, and the rising tide lifts all boats,” said Salimi, who announced his new venture fund, dao5, at the conference.  Big incentives  As every smart-contract blockchain competes to onboard the Mastercards and Frog Nations, one indicator of competitiveness is the size of the war chest a project’s respective foundation can deploy to lure in users.  In the past eight months, Avalanche has launched four nine-figure incentive programs to bring development onto its chain, which even among base layers newly flush with cash, is particularly generous. There’s nearly $800 million in AVAX at play for everything from GameFi to Grimes.  “The goal is on-ramping developers onto Avalanche,” said Gabriel Cardona, an Avalanche developer relations lead and one of 60 engineers with Ava Labs. “In one year, I predict we will have over a billion transactions and well over a thousand dapps.”  Currently, the largest dapps on Avalanche include Trader Joe, a Uniswap fork that serves as the chain’s core decentralized exchange. Another popular dapp is the play-to-earn game Crabada, Avalanche’s answer to the popular Axie Infinity.  Despite Avalanche’s upward trajectory, critics of the blockchain point out that it doesn’t yet have a robust non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace like Ethereum’s OpenSea or Solana’s Magic Eden. Marketplaces serve as core pieces of infrastructure, and Avalanche’s dearth of an OpenSea equivalent has stifled NFT adoption on the chain.  Other critics have pointed to the plethora of “copypasta” projects on Avalanche. To date, the most popular dapps on the chain have been forks of popular protocols like Uniswap or Ohm, or redeployments of blue-chip protocols like Aave and Curve that all first launched on Ethereum.  Such is the dilemma faced by many EVM-compatible chains, which are forced to choose between organically growing their own ecosystem or bootstrapping growth by courting Ethereum’s sloppy seconds.  So far, Avalanche still lacks a uniquely “Avalanchean” project, which even large incentive programs have failed to produce.  Subnets  Perhaps the most buzz at the conference centered around subnets, or networks that allow applications to establish their own customizable blockchains on Avalanche.  Subnets allow projects on Avalanche to set the rules of their own chain – including who the validators are, which programming languages are used and who has access to the subnet. The idea is similar to Polkadot’s parachains, Cosmos’s zones and Ethereum scaling solution SKALE’s networks.  “We have all come to the same conclusion: The way to have scalable and accessible blockchains is by making them application-specific,” said Billy Rennekamp, Cosmos Hub lead at the Interchain Foundation. While Rennekamp told CoinDesk he is a Cosmos enthusiast, he is first and foremost a proponent of cross-chain interoperability.  Avalanche’s subnet architecture is also designed with scalability in mind, allowing computationally intensive applications to avoid clogging the main network, similar to how Axie Infinity built its own Ronin blockchain.  “If you think about the blockchain themselves as a public database, it’s almost like every application needs its own database,” explained Josh Neuroth, head of product at Web 3 infrastructure provider Ankr. “If you want to onboard millions of users, you need your own blockchain.”  Ava Labs’ Cardona, the DevRel who also hosts a podcast called “Subnet Show,” told CoinDesk that it’s possible to “launch a subnet in 20 seconds.”  “We want to create an institutional-friendly subnet with Avalanche and get other DeFi protocols to participate,” Aave’s Kulchev told CoinDesk. “The [know-your-customer check] happens on the subnet level once, and then you’re free to use all the protocols.”  Aave has been grappling with a bifurcation between its retail and institutional client needs, launching Aave Arc last November, a permissioned version of its popular DeFi protocol. A whitelist-only subnet, Kulchev said, could more efficiently bring DeFi to institutional investors conscious of regulatory constraints.  Jump Crypto’s President Kanav Kariya also revealed that the trading giant was “exploring a few subnets with the Avalanche team” in a keynote speech, adding the effort was “still largely explorative.”  “In one year, the CoinMarketCap Top 100 is going to be totally different, and the primary driver will be Avalanche subnets,” said Cardona. “Finally, blockchain is maturing to live up to the promise we always envisioned. It feels very rewarding after all these years.”  Hackathon  After a flurry of panel discussions, networking events and late-night tapas, a two-day, 300-person hackathon bookended the conference.  “The focus is incredible,” Anthony Beaumont, co-founder of Encode Club, told CoinDesk at the hackathon site. “There’s even a husband-wife team that brought their baby.”  CoinDesk spoke with a team of French college students building Clash Royale, a mobile game that allows players to bet with friends using AVAX tokens.  “It was really challenging, we took a lot of time to find an idea,” said a sleep-deprived Bora Mindas, 22, of the hackathon experience. The team built the game on top of an existing Avalanche subnet, called WAGMI.  Avalanche founder Gün Sirer was also spotted at the hackathon, making rounds to advise each individual team.  “It was a nice conversation,” said Mindas, who, when asked by CoinDesk if Gün Sirer revealed any particularly juicy insights, replied with a grin, “No alpha.”  “When I came to crypto, I saw people talking about Avalanche on Twitter,” said Mindas. “I really like the people, so I kept on building.”",POSITIVE,ETH,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | SOL,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/30/can-avalanche-win-over-wall-street-and-degens-alike,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c8e720df1ab245dee7ab44fcc371cf87cd4995b5-4032x3024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The bitcoin price was around $47,026 as of press time, down 1.67% from yesterday.  The cryptocurrency had climbed for eight consecutive days, lifting the price from about $40,000 and reaching a new 2022 high around $48,200 on March 28.  “Based on recent price action, it looks like BTC is consolidating within a range and has room to move higher,” blockchain analytics platform Nansen told CoinDesk. “There are other clear indicators that risk appetite in the market has increased.""  According to Nansen, Ethereum gas fees have been very high recently, which has typically been a solid indicator of a shift to more risk-on investor behavior.  “Bitcoin dropped in the early hours of the morning, after the largest blockchain game Axie Infinity suffered a $625 million hack,” wrote Global Block in its newsletter. “The dip has been bought up as bitcoin remains above $47,000, showing great strength amongst the news of the hack.”  The hack happened in cross-chain bridges that are secured by only one centralized computer.  MacroStrategy, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the enterprise analytics and mobility software provider MicroStrategy (MSTR) that invests in bitcoin as its central business strategy, has obtained a $205 million loan collateralized by bitcoins from Silvergate Bank.  MacroStrategy can use the loan to purchase bitcoin or pay interest and fees related to the loan or for its or MicroStrategy’s general corporate needs.  Luna Foundation Guard (LFG), a non-profit organization focused on UST, resumed buying the largest cryptocurrency after taking a break on Tuesday. It has purchased 5,773 BTC, worth $272 million, this week.  “The buy pressure of MicroStrategy and Luna Foundation Guard is understandably contributing to a strong uptrend in the short-term,” Global Block wrote.  “It could be a simple lull now that MicroStrategy and Terra have paused their buying at this moment” said Jason Deane, chief bitcoin analyst at Quantum Economics. “But it could also be a period of simple consolidation after an eight day run.”  If it is a consolidation, “these are often considered a bullish indicator, as it gives the market time to build a new base on which to make further price discovery,” Deane told CoinDesk.  Deane also said that the number of HODLers, who stick to a buy-and-hold strategy, is increasing rapidly – a positive sign for the price of bitcoin. This also signifies the confidence of long-term bitcoin holders.",POSITIVE,BTC,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TRADING,Angelique Chen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/30/bitcoin-flirts-with-9-day-winning-streak-nears-48k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a0a1dadd4d61a2b97cedf1b647e6a76fe9df8ff0-872x824.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Sentiment improves  The bitcoin Fear & Greed Index entered ""greed"" territory, which indicates bullish sentiment among crypto traders.  The index is at its highest level this year, but is still below peak levels of ""extreme greed"" seen last November. That suggests further room for investor sentiment to improve, especially if BTC's price recovery is sustained.  Over the past few months, however, sentiment readings have been erratic as BTC declined by as much as 50% and then stabilized in a trading range, albeit with 20% price swings. It is very difficult to get a clear reading on crypto sentiment, especially during times of market stress.  ""Market participants should keep in mind that every time we have shown the slightest sign of greed this spring, the market has slammed us back into a fearful state,"" Arcane Research wrote in a report.  Bitcoin dominance fades  Bitcoin's market capitalization relative to the total crypto market cap, or the ""dominance ratio,"" dipped below its 50-day moving average, which means altcoins are starting to outperform.  Typically, a declining bitcoin dominance ratio indicates a greater appetite for risk among crypto investors. In contrast, a rising dominance ratio signals a flight to safety as investors reduce their exposure to altcoins, which have a greater risk profile than bitcoin.  For now, the dominance ratio is stabilizing after a sharp decline last year. A base of around 40% is seen in the chart below, which is above the previous low of 35% reached in 2018.

42410901,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggt3kj,1648669201,How a Post-Merge Ethereum Could Attract Institutional Investment,"As anticipation and mainstream media coverage begin to ramp up ahead of “the Merge,” a popular narrative about staked ether (ETH) and its derivatives is beginning to take shape: namely, that staked ETH could be an ideal investment vehicle for major institutions looking to dip their toes into crypto holdings.  Currently, staked ETH is already a wildly popular investment among crypto traders and investors, even though those deposits are illiquid and impossible to trade until sometime after the Merge takes place. Liquid staking solutions – services that offer users a tradable token representing those deposits in the ETH 2.0 staking contract– currently account for roughly $20 billion in deposits, per DeFiLlama, almost 10% of all of DeFi’s total value locked (TVL).  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets.Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  The reason for this incredible success is attributable to how staked ETH derivatives offer yield farmers lucrative opportunities as part of complex farming strategies. For instance, users can leverage stETH, Lido’s staked ETH derivative, as collateral for many DeFi protocols.  Curve’s single largest pool is “steth,” with $4.91 billion in total value locked.Aave is another main destination for stETH, with $1.63 billion total stETH supplied. One popular strategy is when a user deposits their ETH into the Ethereum staking contract through Lido and receives stETH, then supplies their stETH as collateral to borrow more ETH against it, and re-stakes that borrowed ETH for stETH. The user can repeat this process multiple times over, in large part because the interest gained by staking is much higher than the borrowing rates across DeFi lending platforms. For instance, the APR for staking ETH is approximately 4%, while ETH’s variable interest rate for borrowing is 2.33% on AAVE’s lending platform, allowing them to create a leveraged yield position.  While the strategies institutions and individual farmers utilize with the assets will be different, staked ether’s core properties appeal to both for similar reasons.  A popular talking point among Ethereum maximalists is the “triple halvening” – after the Merge, ETH’s yearly inflation rate will drop from 4.3% to 0.43%, with new emissions falling from 12,000 ETH a day to 1,280 ETH a day. Combined with EIP 1559, which introduced an Ethereum burn mechanism, the switch to proof-of-stake will be the equivalent of three Bitcoin “halvenings” at once, the argument goes.  Read more: Traders Bet on Ether Staking After Ethereum 2.0 Upgrade  While traders have been excited at the forthcoming ETH supply shock for years (not to mention the beefier staking returns, which by some estimates might exceed 10%), institutions are starting to get the message as well.  In March, staking services provider Staked introduced a staked ETH trust aiming for 8% returns. Likewise, in June, Switzerland-based Sygnum Bank introduced institutional staking services for its clients. Even Goldman Sachs is getting in on the action.  The crypto market can be intimidating for institutional investors because it so rarely seems tethered to any fundamentals – the mess of dogcoins, memecoins and outright scams would put off any self-respecting suit. But trackable returns, provable scarcity and technological infrastructure – these are qualities an investment desk can appreciate.  Over 10 million ETH worth $34 billion is currently staked in the ETH 2.0 contract. As the buzz approaching the Merge grows louder, we expect to see more headlines about major financial entities getting involved as well.  Zelda’s big day  This has been an exciting week at Valid Points, as CoinDesk’s very own Beacon Chain validator, dubbed “Zelda,” successfully proposed a block yesterday. Zelda has been active since February 2021, and with Zelda’s new block proposal our total block proposals has increased to eight!  Zelda was awarded 0.0289 ETH or $98.23 for the successful block proposal. As shown in the graph in the Validator Health Data Visualization, there was a large increase in daily income yesterday, as block proposals are greater than attestations in one-time rewards. Zelda, over its entire lifetime, has earned 2.2177 ETH or $7,537.96.  Zelda’s last block proposal occurred in November 2021, five months ago. According to data sourced from etherscan.io, the average number of blocks produced daily in 2022 on the Ethereum network is approximately 6,455 blocks, and with 326,516 active validators an individual validator such as Zelda has a slim chance of receiving a block proposal each day.  Congrats, Zelda!  Pulse check  The following is an overview of network activity on the Ethereum Beacon Chain over the past week. For more information about the metrics featured in this section, check out our 101 explainer on Eth 2.0 metrics.     Disclaimer: All profits made from CoinDesk’s Eth 2.0 staking venture will be donated to a charity of the company’s choosing once transfers are enabled on the network.  Validated takes  The dominance of Prysm, the leading client for the Ethereum proof-of-stake protocol, has waned to 62%.  WHY IT MATTERS: Ethereum’s core developers have been warning about the lack of client diversity on the Beacon Chain because of the risk stemming from having more than two-thirds of all validators concentrated on a single client. While there is still an urgent need for improved diversity, the decrease in Prysm’s dominance to less than two-thirds majority demonstrates how the Ethereum community is making strides to address the lack of client diversity.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission proposed revising the definition of a securities dealer.  WHY IT MATTERS: The SEC’s proposal expands what it means to be a “dealer” to include traders and liquidity providers that utilize automated and algorithmic trading technology. A footnote in the 200-page document said the proposal would include any digital assets deemed as securities, which has been interpreted by some legal experts as a shadow attack on DeFi.  American policymakers are pushing to create a digital dollar through the introduction of the ECASH Bill.  WHY IT MATTERS: The Electronic Currency And Secure Hardware Act would put the U.S. Treasury Department in charge of piloting digital dollar technologies that replicate the privacy-respecting characteristics of physical dollar bills. This digital dollar would be deemed legal tender and identical to a physical greenback.  Axie Infinity's Ronin Network has been exploited for 173,600 ETH and 25.5 million USDC.  WHY IT MATTERS: The attacker compromised Ronin validators by using hacked private keys to forge fake withdrawals, making this one of the largest exploits in DeFi history. This attack highlights how the crypto space can be a vulnerable industry as the open-source nature of crypto creates a perfect environment for attackers to exploit.  Google Searches for “Ethereum Merge” hit an all-time high.  WHY IT MATTERS: CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole wrote, “Google Trends, a widely used tool to gauge general or retail interest in trending topics, recently showed a peak value of 100 for the worldwide search query ‘Ethereum Merge’ for the past 12 months.” Peak popular interest in the “Ethereum Merge” highlights the ongoing discussions and conversations about Ethereum post-Merge, which includes ETH’s supply decreasing and the impact proof-of-stake will have on the environment.

Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, however, considers bitcoin “ready for prime time.”  Each made their case Wednesday at the annual Barclays Crypto and Blockchain Summit, held virtually.  Bitcoin “was designed as peer-to-peer electronic cash,” said Michael, not as “replacement for gold in a vault.” While bitcoin may be able to function as digital gold, “there’s so much more we can get from it,” he said.  Michael said El Salvador adopting bitcoin as one of its legal currencies (besides the U.S. dollar) and Twitter (TWTR) enabling micropayments for tipping via crypto give him hope things are shifting back to Satoshi Nakamoto's original vision for the Bitcoin network as a peer-to-peer electronic payment system.  In a separate presentation, Novogratz lauded bitcoin as digital gold, saying its primary use is as a hedge against “really bad fiscal stewardship.” He took note of recent currency collapses in Turkey and Russia as well as the fiscal issues facing the U.S. after a long period of Federal Reserve money printing.  Bitcoin adoption is accelerating everywhere, said Novogratz, be it by individuals, institutions or pension funds. Bitcoin, he said, is “ready for prime time.”  A research report from Bank of America last week spoke to the store-of-value proposition, noting bitcoin has been trading lately more like a risk asset and less as an inflation hedge.  The report authors said the correlation between bitcoin and the S&P 500 stock index rose to an all-time high at the end of January (but has decreased since then). The correlation between bitcoin and gold, on the other hand, has been close to zero since June.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Michael Bellusci,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/30/galaxys-novogratz-and-bakkts-michael-differ-on-bitcoins-case-as-digital-gold,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8fdab355842e2a09c7fabd494b532011eae7579a-7000x7000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In the wave of higher highs, ILV bulls have their eyes on $730, but this outlook is valid only as long as prices are held above $600. Past Performance The ILV price is edging higher when writing, stable on the last trading day but adding 12 percent in the previous week of trading versus the USDT. Technically, the ILV price is within a bullish breakout pattern as per the formation in the daily chart, pointing to strength. Illuvium Technical Analysis The path of least resistance is northwards, as aforementioned. However, after a welcomed expansion, there are hints of weakness. Still, aggressive Illuvium traders might find entries on dips above $600—flashing with March 2022 highs in a bullish breakout pattern. In that case, the immediate buy target stands at February 2022 highs of around $730, supported by the present high volatility—the upper and middle BB are diverging—and improving sentiment, explaining why most traders are upbeat. What to Expect from ILV? As per the ILVUSDT candlestick arrangement in the daily chart, traders are in the driving seat. Nonetheless, after a 37 percent expansion from 2022 lows, there are hints of exhaustion.

42394261,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvaoZn,1648665138,"If Money Is Speech, CBDCs Should Be Tools for Freedom","There is no constitutional right guaranteeing that you can spend your money as you please. Although there should be, and there’s precedent for thinking that money is akin to speech and spending it (within the bounds of established law) a form of expression.  This particular problem has come to light as the U.S. government studies a potential central bank digital currency (CBDC). A digital dollar, as it is sometimes called, is essentially a way to make an internet-native version of cash and coins.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Central bankers, if they support CBDCs, often point to the greater control a state-run monetary ledger affords over microeconomic and macroeconomic policy. A digital dollar could help automate tax collection, streamline welfare payments and inform decisions around setting interest rates.  Like everything else in the internet age, CBDCs are about big data: State-run ledgers would give near-complete insight into how money is being spent in a country. In fact, Agustin Carstens, general manager of the “central bank of central banks,” the Bank for International Settlements, said:  “We don’t know who’s using a $100 bill today and we don’t know who’s using a 1,000 peso bill today.” With CBDCs, that would be possible, he noted.  That’s quite dystopian for anyone who thinks there ought to be a measure of financial privacy – the same privacy afforded today by physical cash. Further, because CBDCs are mostly just research projects at this stage, they invite a high degree of skepticism and conspiracy theories.  Namely, people are worried “Govcoins” could become tools for coercion or censorship.  ""Should people be encouraged to eat the foods decided best for them, such as a plant or insect-based diet? CBDCs could do the trick. Should people be limited in how much they can spend per week on carbon-intensive purchases? CBDCs could help with that too,” N.S. Lyons, author of The Upheaval Substack, wrote last week in conservative-leaning digital mag City Journal.  It shouldn’t be controversial to say that governments want insight and oversight over monetary flows. They enact policies that degrade privacy and set limits around how money can be spent; often in service of the noble aim of combating terrorist financing and money laundering.  See also: Stablecoins and CBDCs: Private Vs. Public Monetary Innovation  Lyons’ concerns are certainly, technically possible with CBDCs. In fact, Rohan Grey, assistant professor at Willamette University, said it’s already an established trend with some types of government-issued digital money. In the U.S., for instance, food welfare programs like Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) set barriers around what can be purchased as well as time-limits within which the benefit must be spent.  “I could certainly imagine a CBDC enhancing individual choice and wellbeing, etc., but probably only if designed with that in mind. Likewise, it’s not hard to imagine a CBDC being abused in some jurisdictions,” Matt Homer, executive in residence at Nyca Partners and former executive deputy superintendent at New York State Department of Financial Services, told me over Telegram.  Widely accepted  The issue is magnified if CBDCs become generally accepted, widely adopted tender. Although sometimes presented as a form of greenbacks – which allows Alice to give Bob a quarter without an intermediary, ensuring both parties’ privacy and autonomy – a CBDC might end up looking more like company scrip.  Governments are legal monopolies, and letting them determine how public money is spent – which markets are kosher, who or what is off limits – would essentially turn the U.S. into a company town that stretches coast to coast.  However, there’s a strong case to be made that CBDCs should come with the same established guarantees of cash. They could be reasonably private and flow through an economy without intermediation – potentially into illegal markets, like cash.  Spending money is essentially disseminating speech and a form of association. This is the lesson from Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. As such, civil rights advocates should fight for the same rights guaranteed by the First Amendment to apply to state-operated monetary rails.  “These are new First Amendment waters we’re sailing in,” Benjamin Barr, a lawyer at Barr & Klein PLLC specializing in free speech rights, told CoinDesk over email. It isn’t necessarily an easy fight, he noted. For decades, privacy advocates have fought to scale back or dismantle the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering and terrorist financing rules, which establish broad mandates to surveil even everyday citizens nominally to prevent crime, on privacy grounds and have failed.  “Government will always have some designated ‘governmental interest’ behind a regulatory oversight CBDC program – fighting tax evasion, ensuring the efficiency of Medicaid/Medicare by ensuring healthy eating, fighting crime, the war on terror … the list goes on and on,” Barr said.  So any “challenge or restriction” placed on a CBDC would need to weigh the speech interests of the “transaction as compared to the importance of the government interest at hand,” he added.  Though we may never get to the point where CBDCs become tools to foster certain behaviors or quash industries or interests that supposedly stand against the public interest.  “I'm skeptical about using CBDC as a spending control instrument, not just because I think it might undermine its attractiveness, and may even create unintended opposition,” John Kiff, ​​a former senior financial sector expert at the International Monetary Fund, wrote in an email. He added that such restricted use of CBDCs would hamper fungibility, “and for me fungibility is a core CBDC characteristic.”  Greater freedom  In some sense, if done right, CBDCs would be an even greater tool for freedom and a boon for civil liberties.  Today, the digitized versions of cash you’re used to dealing with aren’t actually U.S. dollars, but liabilities of private companies that correspond to the value of a dollar – it’s skeuomorphic! Banks, credit providers and money-processors track their dollar-denominated liabilities on centralized ledgers.  Even “peer-to-peer” payments providers like Cash App are intermediaries! But there are ways to design systems that reduce centralization. Blockchains typically distribute this notational role across a host of computers, an imperfect system that provides user autonomy over their money but not necessarily privacy. Grey recently supported a bill for E-CASH, a blockchain-less, state-backed money.  See also: House 'ECASH' Bill Can Fast Track CBDC Adoption in US  As Homer said, a CBDC will function as it is made. What you could expect from a CBDC “depends on the design choices made for a CBDC, the accountability and governance features associated with it, and the extent to which the code/system is transparent to the public,” he said.  Just as the barriers to launching a CBDC are largely political rather than technological, so is the fight to guarantee that citizens can send their digital dollars as they wish. It’s just a matter of public will.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/03/30/if-money-is-speech-cbdcs-should-be-tools-for-freedom,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/521b2d2e57c7e27c3cc13c93b8e0d84ebca62d5c-2048x1367.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Evolved Ape Red Flags Notably, the Evolved Ape project lasted only a week, but several red flags had already manifested. First, the announcements following the public presale were unprofessional, plus a couple of the project leaders were not part of the project anymore.

Two weeks ago, NewsBTC reported a potential 40% rally for VeChain. Based on an analysis from Justin Bennett, the cryptocurrency was on the brick of breaking above a trend line which signaled potential appreciation. This trend line marked the beginning of a multi-month downtrend, and its reversal could take VeChain into the $0.10 price point. Therefore, Bennett called this move &apos;significant in terms of the overall context of the market&apos;. VeChain is yet to complete its full bullish trajectory into the $0.10 levels and beyond. However, it did manage to score a 90% rally, according to Bennett, destroying the market expectations of further downside: VET is the same project everyone on CT said was dead for months. +97% in 16 days is quite the move for a &apos;dead&apos; coin.

42374989,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw4ovX,1648662156,Lawmakers Want Unregulated Crypto Firms Out of the EU,"Lawmakers in the European Union (EU) want to cut off unregulated crypto firms from the bloc’s financial system.  New provisions proposed by lawmakers in an anti-money laundering (AML) legislative draft up for a parliamentary committee vote on Thursday stipulates financial and credit institutions, along with regulated crypto firms in the EU, will be prohibited from doing any business with what it calls non-compliant crypto firms.  The text defines a non-compliant crypto-asset service provider to be a firm “that is not established in any jurisdiction or does not have a central contact point or substantive management presence in any jurisdiction and that is unaffiliated with a regulated entity or that operates in the Union” without authorization under the upcoming Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework that seeks to set up a license that would allow crypto firms regulated in one EU member state to operate in others.  The provision implies that crypto firms looking to offer services to customers in the EU must be registered as a business and also be licensed or approved by a regulator in any jurisdiction.  The aim of the proposed legislation is to cut off crypto service providers operating in the EU from its financial system until these firms become properly regulated, a person familiar with the matter told CoinDesk.  Multiple people suggested trouble may be ahead for companies like Binance, which has received warnings from regulators in jurisdictions including the U.K., Malta and Italy, among others, over its level of authorization. Binance, which is registered in the Cayman Islands, currently has no head office, but it did recently receive licenses to provide crypto services in Bahrain and Dubai.  Binance declined to comment on “rumors and speculation.”  AML week at the European Parliament  Crypto is front and center at the European Parliament this week as it debates proposed anti-money laundering legislation. On Thursday, lawmakers in the parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs will be voting on multiple AML packages – that will apply to crypto transactions as well as crypto asset service providers – before the drafts head to further negotiations between branches of the European Union (EU) government.  One framework up for a decisive vote on Thursday, aimed at extending existing AML laws to crypto transactions, contains provisions looking to end anonymous crypto payments and include transfers to self-hosted or private wallets (also called unhosted wallets) in AML checks. The provisions have drawn the ire of the crypto industry around the world because individuals and businesses view the rules as a threat to privacy.  The other, slightly overlooked framework that would prevent the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing is also up for a vote on Thursday. In addition to the provision seeking to cut off non-compliant crypto firms from the EU, this draft framework contains a proposal from lawmakers to set up a public register of shell banks and unregulated crypto firms.  According to the provision, the responsibility of setting up and maintaining the registry would fall under the new AML authority (AMLA), which lawmakers are working to ensure will have supervision power over the crypto space.  “AMLA shall set up and maintain an indicative and non-exhaustive public register of shell banks and non-compliant crypto-asset service providers operating within and outside the Union based on information provided by competent authorities, supervisors, the Commission or obliged entities,” the draft said. These measures are needed given the high risk of money laundering and terrorist financing inherent to these entities, according to the draft.  Read more: Crypto Privacy Positions Harden Ahead of Crunch EU Vote  The provisions pertaining to non-compliant crypto firms and shell banks were proposed by the co-rapporteurs, Finnish politician Eero Heinäluoma and French politician Damien Carême, in charge of overseeing the framework as it moves through the legislative process.  “Your co-rapporteurs extend specific enhanced due diligence measures to crypto-asset transactions, service providers and accounts, and insert a specific prohibition of correspondent relationships with non-compliant crypto-asset service providers,” the draft said.  The proposed AML measures, including the controversial provision seeking to impose verification requirements for crypto transfers to unhosted wallets, are likely to pass through the committee vote on Thursday.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/30/lawmakers-want-unregulated-crypto-firms-out-of-the-eu,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2e1d8752526588d1182b8a2790a2a592163a0c4e-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374988,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw4own,1648659998,Women-Led DAO Tackles (Lack of) Gender Diversity in Crypto,"Crypto might represent the future of finance, but the fast-growing digital-asset industry still suffers from an age-old problem: a lack of gender diversity.  One women-led group is trying to improve the situation, fielding a presence at last week's conference for the Avalanche blockchain and at the ETHDenver conference in February. H.E.R. DAO is a woman-led decentralized autonomous organization that is focusing on increasing gender diversity in blockchain ecosystems. The group has sponsored ""Hacker Houses"" for women developers across the world, and the goal is more ""versatile, holistic innovations,"" according to its website.  Just as in traditional finance, where women have historically struggled to match their male counterparts’ rates in investing, men also dominate crypto investing. According to a study from CNBC and an Acorn Next Gen Investor survey in August 2021, men are twice as likely as women to invest in cryptocurrencies. Another report found that fewer than 5% of crypto entrepreneurs are female.  Attempting to tackle the lack of female participation in crypto, H.E.R. DAO creates safe spaces for women while organizing Hacker Houses, meetups, hackathons and conference participation for women in the space. The group also caters to trans women and non-binary audiences, according to the website.  Avalanche blockchain conference  Most recently, H.E.R. DAO members attended last week's Avalanche Summit in Barcelona. Avalanche’s conference tickets cost around $600 plus travel expenses, making it costly for most. Avalanche sponsored H.E.R. DAO’s Hacker House in Barcelona and also funded 25 women developers from the decentralized autonomous organization to attend the summit in-person.  Tracey Bowen, founder of H.E.R. DAO, attended the summit along with the 25 DAO members and organized a Hacker House as part of the wider Avalanche Hackathon that happened across three days after the conference.  A Hacker House consists of a group of developers building and working on a problem or creating a project within a short period of time. The goal is to come up with a solution that can either be the beginning of a startup or a prototype that participants then work on.  Bowen said the Hacker House was a huge success, with one of H.E.R. DAO’s teams (MatchMe.NFT) winning two prizes.  Gender diversity at crypto conferences  When it comes to crypto conferences, Bowen believes that more needs to be done to incorporate more women. At the Avalanche Summit, Bowen said that “although there are more women here than there would have been five years ago, most attendees are still male.” She said there needs to be more women-focused environments like H.E.R. DAO’s Hacker House.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Jay Kurahashi-Sofue, vice president of marketing at Ava Labs and who helped organize the Avalanche Summit in Barcelona, said it was extremely important to include female voices at the summit and make sure anyone who wanted to attend, could, despite their financial background.  Out of the 60 panels at the conference, 48% of the panels had female speakers, according to data from Ava Labs.  In terms of attendees, Ava Labs could not provide demographic information on attendance because it did not collect data from ticket holders.  This was not the first Hacker House that Bowen organized. In February, H.E.R. DAO hosted its first Hacker House at ETHDenver, where the open-source blockchain Harmony funded travel scholarships to bring 150 women to the event. Most recently, the DAO hosted a Hacker House in Brazil with Binance’s Trust Wallet, which Harmony also funded.  “There were no barriers to entry. We were able to get people from all corners of the globe,” said Bowen. Bowen stressed the importance of making crypto a welcoming industry for marginalized communities. “Mass adoption in crypto will not happen without inclusion,” Bowen said.  Bowen said she plans to establish permanent Hacker Houses for women in Africa and Lisbon.",POSITIVE,없음,AVAX | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | SPONSORED | TRADING,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/30/women-led-dao-tackles-lack-of-gender-diversity-in-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1eda4abddfa296a04c615449ab994d616de03db2-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420981,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXAov7,1648656774,Inside the Ukrainian Crypto Startup Waging Cyberwar on Russia,"By day, Dmytro Budorin, CEO of Ukrainian startup Hacken, and his team perform cybersecurity audits of cryptocurrency protocols and exchanges. After-hours, the company turns into a collective of hacktivists ravaging the Russian segment of the Internet.  The Russian invasion, which began Feb. 24, turned Ukraine, a nation of 44 million, into a battleground, made civilians take up arms to protect their neighborhoods – and galvanized a worldwide cyber army of hackers waging digital retaliation on Russia. Hacken’s 70 employees are among them, juggling cybersecurity business, support for fellow Ukrainians on the ground and cyber attacks on Russia.  Read More: Ukraine Is Buying Bulletproof Vests and Night-Vision Goggles Using Crypto  “On the first day of the war, everybody was very frustrated and we decided it’s time to open [our own] front,” Budoring told CoinDesk during a video call, his face exhausted and gray.  As we spoke in early March, Budorin was outside Ukraine, but his wife and in-laws were still stuck in Mariupol, a seaside city in the south of Ukraine that has been heavily shelled by the Russian armed forces for weeks. For some time, Budorin could not communicate with his relatives, he said.  Later, the family managed to get out of the city, driving west through the war-torn country and struggling to find gas for the car or a place to sleep over the four-day trip, Budorin said. Now, all are safe, he said.  Recruiting a cyber army against Russia  “We had some financial cushion, so we donated around $260,000 from our [company] account to various funds” helping Ukraine during the war, Budorin said. The funds mostly went to the Turn Back Alive fund, which is helping finance the Ukrainian army and managed to raise over 400 BTC over the first month of the war, as well as to the volunteer group headed by the activist Tata Kepler.  “Days off and hobbies are over. When the guys finish their work at the company they get busy helping people in Ukraine with coordination, communication, evacuating people, delivering body armor and helmets,” Budorin said.  Hacken has kept up with meeting its business goals auditing the security of crypto exchanges, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces, Budorin said. Revenue didn’t suffer much, he added, because 90% of Hacken’s clients are not in Ukraine nor in Russia.  According to Alex Petrov, former chief information officer at Bitfury Group, Hacken is well-known in the Ukrainian IT community for its security audits. “Decent tech level, active and growing quickly,” Petrov told CoinDesk.  There was a financial toll, though: Some Russian holders of Hacken’s own HAI token, which is used to pay for its products and services (the company also accepts other crypto and fiat currencies), disagreed with the company's public statements condemning President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and sold their bags, dropping the price. Hacken was unmoved by this, with Budorin saying: “Let them sell.”  Even before the war, Hacken created a tool for companies to run stress tests and check how resilient their servers are against distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS), which is when a network of computers overwhelms a website with fake requests until the website goes down. The product, titled disBalancer, was turned into a cyber weapon to “DDos the entire Russian internet,” Budoring said.  According to him, the app was downloaded over 55,000 times, and there are around 5,000 active computers using it to run coordinated DDoS attacks. Fellow devs from the IT Guild of Ukraine, the local trade association, helped adapt the software for multiple platforms.  “At the moment, disBalancer is developing towards [becoming] a tool for smart attacks [including] learning how to get around CAPTCHA tests, how to find vulnerabilities,” Budorin said.  The disBalancer community now counts over 15,000 people around the world, said Oleg Bevz, marketing director at Hacken, with a heavy representation from the blockchain and crypto industries.  The overarching goal is to create a global cyber army founded by Ukrainians, Budorin said. The community around Hacken is in touch with other hacktivist collectives, such as the IT Army of Ukraine, created in response to a call by Ukraine’s minister for digital transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov. Anonymous, the well-known hacker group that declared a cyber war against the Russian government, isn’t in touch with Hacken at the moment, Budorin said.  Read more:'Absolutely Surreal': Inside a Fund Raising Millions in Crypto for Besieged Ukraine  ‘Buy tickets ASAP’  Even before the war started, Budoring knew something bad was coming.  As the tensions around the Russian-Ukrainian border were mounting, with Russian troops gathering there, Budorin decided to relocate all 70 people working at Hacken to the West. Hacken’s headquarter is in Estonia, but most employees were located in Ukraine.  On Feb. 14, the decision was made.  “We told everyone: ‘Buy tickets ASAP, we need to leave, meet you in Barcelona.’ We realized that the risks were just too high and it’s time to make a decision, otherwise we would fail to protect our staff,” Budorin said.  Like many people in and outside Ukraine, Budorin initially believed the trouble would only be about the Donbass area, the region in eastern Ukraine that broke away during the armed conflict in 2014, encouraged by Russia. As people did not expect an assault on the entire nation, many considered the relocation temporary, refused to go at all or didn’t take their families with them.  Hacken is trying hard to relocate all of its staff to Western Ukraine, but some people are stuck in the cities engulfed by the war. “They don’t always have an internet connection. Sometimes, during a call, people say: ‘Sorry, we’re having an airstrike here, need to go downstairs to the basement, call you back in an hour,” Budorin said.  The damage done to Russia  A picture of a crowd running from a riot police officer under the Russian flag, and a lone silhouette under the Ukrainian flag stopping a tank, divided by a line with the phrase “Why?” was one colorful example of a wave of defacing attacks on Russia’s government websites.  The picture, which appeared on March 8 on the websites of Russia’s Federal Penitentiary Service, Mininstry of Energy and other government bodies, encapsulated Ukrainians’ frustration toward Russians: We’re dealing with bombs and tanks, and you’re afraid to go on the streets and protest?  Over the early weeks of the war, multiple websites of government agencies, as well as government-funded and loyal media, suffered DDoS attacks, hacks and defacing. The attacks were carried out by a global community of hackers, from the Anonymous collective to single hacktivists striking Russian websites from their homes in Ukraine. It’s not clear which group was responsible for defacing the government websites on March 8.  Mid-March, the Russian government acknowledged the scale of attacks. The Ministry of Digital Development and Communications said they were twice as powerful as any previous ones, the Washington Post reported.  Much of the credit (or blame, depending on one’s perspective) goes to hacktivists like those at Hacken, the ​​IT Army of Ukraine, Belarusian Cyber Partisan group and global hackers’ collectives like Anonymous and Squad 303.  The total number of hacktivists attacking Russia on the cyber frontlines is unclear, but the community appears to be quite large. For example, the Telegram channel of the IT Army of Ukraine now has over 300,000 subscribers and counting. Every day, the channel publishes a new list of targets for a fresh cyberattack.  Read More: Ukraine's Zelenskyy Signs Virtual Assets Bill Into Law, Legalizing Crypto  The calls are often accompanied with pugnacious intros, such as “How about block Russians from traveling? Find some popular tourism shops below” or “P2P crypto exchange connected to Sber, VTB and other Russian banks. Make them cry!”  Since the channel was launched on Feb. 28, the list of targets has included the official websites of the Kremlin, Federal Security Service (FSB, successor to the Soviet KGB), communication servers of the FSB and Rosgvardia (recently formed riot police forces), federal agencies and city councils, Russian Railways, major Russian banks, the Moscow Stock Exchange, the payment system Mir (created to replace SWIFT in Russia), oil and gas companies and many others.  Even seemingly insignificant targets have made the list, such as platforms for freelance gigs. “Russian freelancer marketplaces are not obvious targets, however we believe they should feel the war is real too. Every Russian who supports putin, war, killing Ukrainians should experience economical damage,” a member of the channel said.  The IT Army of Ukraine did not respond to CoinDesk's request for comment.  Ukraine vs. Russian propaganda  DDoS attacks and website defacing are just part of the global cyber assault on Russia. From the very first days of the Russian invasion in Ukraine, some Russians started receiving unusual calls to their mobile phones. A recorded message was telling them that Russian soldiers were dying in Ukraine and Russians must stop the war, go out to the streets to protest and not let their sons go to the battlefield.  It’s hard to gauge how many Russians received similar calls, texts or emails about the war. It’s even harder to evaluate if this guerilla information war was successful at changing public sentiment in Russia, where, according to some accounts, the majority of the population might be supporting the invasion.  However, the hacker group Squad 303 claimed to have facilitated more than 20 million SMS and WhatsApp messages to Russian phone numbers about the war, via a dedicated website titled 1920.in, after the Soviet-Polish war of 1919-1921.  “The joint action of all the states of the free world, as a response to Russia’s aggression, will lead to the collapse of the entire country. However, nearly 150 million Russians do not know the truth about the causes or course of the war in Ukraine. It is fed with the lies of the Kremlin propaganda,” the website says, adding that everyone can “convey a direct message to the inhabitants of this enslaved country.”  According to Bevz, Hacken’s marketing director, entrepreneurs in Ukraine, including the commercial call centers, switched from their normal businesses to waging information attacks on Russians.  “I know some companies coordinated to launch text messages and some call centers that previously were cold-calling people to sell something immediately switched from, say, selling water coolers, to selling the truth to Russians,” Bevz said, adding there might be as many as a thousand such companies.  “Someone was a product manager, someone was a [chief technology officer], and when the war started the company stopped the operations, so they organized all available developers so that they could DDoS” Russian websites, Bevz said.  As for Hacken, the company keeps working on the weaponized version of disBalancer to make it as easy to use as possible, Bevz said: “Our big goal is that a housewife in Texas can open her laptop and launch an attack on Russia in two clicks.”  More from CoinDesk on Ukraine and Russia  Apparent Ukraine WORLD Airdrop Might Be Spoof  The peaceful world tokens that appeared to be sent by Ukraine's crypto addresses could have been spoofed, blockchain analysts said.

42420978,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXAos1,1648656695,"A Digital Dollar May Help the Poor, but It’s Far From a Done Deal","Advocates for a digital dollar in the U.S. point to many possible benefits of such a currency, saying it would lead to greater financial inclusion, allow for a more efficient distribution of government benefits and provide a faster and cheaper way to send money overseas.  But the issue of whether to have a digital dollar is far from settled, although it may have received a boost earlier this month when President Joe Biden issued an executive order that asked federal agencies to study the issue.  Pandemic relief  One example of how a digital dollar could have helped occurred when the U.S. government issued stimulus checks as a form of COVID-19 relief. Crypto enthusiasts claimed that instead of issuing checks, an easier and faster way to send the money to people would have been to simply airdrop digital dollars.  A digital dollar could deliver public benefits from the government in a much more efficient manner than the current system, according to Briana Marbury, executive director of the nonprofit Interledger Foundation.  With the COVID relief payments, the government was scrambling to get checks distributed, and in some cases, it didn’t even have the right addresses for people who had moved. In other cases, people weren’t registered with the Internal Revenue Service because their income was below the threshold required to file taxes.  “They were just up in arms and couldn’t figure out how to get these checks out to people in a fast and efficient way and it was just something that was very needed at the time,” Marbury said.  Similar difficulties arose with the $2.2 trillion CARES Act for small- to medium-size businesses and farmers.  With a CBDC, every person would have been issued a digital wallet that would allow them direct access to their funds, avoiding those obstacles, some crypto enthusiasts claimed. In fact, lawmakers had proposed that the Federal Reserve issue a digital dollar in March 2020, but ultimately decided for direct bank deposits.  Financial inclusion  Jim Cunha, an official at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, says a digital currency could be one part of a solution to address an issue that’s bigger than just distributing government funds. That issue is including more people in the financial system.  “If you want to help solve financial inclusion, you’d have to have a public policy goal of doing that,” Cunha said. “A new technology by itself is not going to fix financial inclusion, just like it’s not going to fix cross-border.""  “One little use case and you can see how CBDC could have some potential, is oversimplifying it,"" Cunha said. ""But it shows you the potential. We just haven't built on that yet.”  In the U.S., roughly 35% of low-income individuals open up bank accounts just to receive government funds. That number includes only those who qualify for opening a bank account, not people who want to, but don’t have the ability, to do so.  Some 7.1 million people, or 5.4% of the population in the U.S., are unbanked, and when including the underbanked to count those who don’t have access to mainstream financial services like credit cards and loans, the number goes up to 14 million.  Many of them are immigrants who send remittances overseas to their home countries, which is often an expensive service.  “They can either send that extra amount to their family and friends back home, thereby increasing their economies or even just being able to put that in their own pockets,” Marbury said. If the Federal Reserve were to issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC), it would probably charge much lower fees on remittances than private companies do, she added.  Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, has made a similar point.  “Americans shouldn’t have to pay exorbitant fees just to use the money they’ve already earned … a central bank digital currency can work with these no-fee accounts to make sure working families have access to the payment system and full participation in our economy,” Brown said at committee hearing last September.  How would a digital dollar work?  Some say that while a digital currency could help low-income families and individuals, the details of a digital dollar need to be fleshed out.  “CBDCs could have a great impact on fiscal policy, particularly for those in need,” said Jennifer Lassiter, executive director at the Digital Dollar Project. “But we will not know for sure, to what extent positive or negative impacts CBDCs would have if we do not experiment on specific use cases.”  A report earlier this month from the Brookings Institution written by Tim Massad, a former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and Howell Jackson, a Harvard Law School professor, said that instead of getting the Fed involved, “the Treasury Department could, relatively quickly, create digital accounts to provide payment services that would be especially valuable to unbanked and underbanked individuals.”  Not all agree  There’s no consensus that a digital currency is necessary. Lawmakers and banks have been focusing on the issue of financial inclusion for years, and new products and services that are internet- or phone-based have already led to more financial inclusion, said Scott Talbott, a lobbyist for the Electronic Transactions Association, a group that represents big financial institutions like JPMorgan Chase, Mastercard and PayPal.  Talbott pointed to examples like being able to pay with cash from any location and e-cash, an electronic dollar that is issued by the Treasury Department and has similar characteristics to a CBDC.  Rather than creating a whole new system, it would be more efficient to continue with the current one and make “tweaks” to accommodate the CBDC, he suggested.  “If we're talking about creating a whole new system, where the Fed creates a new rail or a new car or something, that's a lot of effort to try to mimic what we already have,” Talbott added.  If the government decides to pursue a digital dollar, it would still take years for it to be issued. Some decision makers are eyeing the latter half of this decade.  “Yes, there are some challenges with implementation,"" Marbury said. ""But let's experiment, let's break this thing. And let's see where our vulnerabilities are so that we can begin to create a system that works for everybody and that does not exclude certain populations of the American people.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | COMMODITY | FIAT | REGULATION | AIRDROP,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/30/a-digital-dollar-may-help-the-poor-but-its-far-from-a-done-deal,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2f4e6df8a9b7cc88acd5e16753853fedc7ecc472-6000x3376.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Nova Labs also confirmed earlier reports of a $200 million Series D funding round led by Tiger Global, with participation from Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY) and others. The latest funding round brings the California-based company’s valuation to $1.2 billion.  The so-called “People’s Network” – a decentralized telecommunications network powered by crypto incentives – is growing fast. Over 680,000 mining “hotspots” are online, with approximately 75,000 new hotspots being added monthly, according to Nova Labs Chief Operating Officer Frank Mong. Hotspot owners provide spare bandwidth in exchange for HNT tokens, which currently trade at $24.68 a pop.  Mong said there are hotspots in over 50,000 cities around the world, with another 5,000 cities being added to the map each month.  “The flywheel has really taken off,” Mong told CoinDesk.

Instead, he said the name change is meant to give a greater sense of separation between the parent company (which began as a non-crypto tech startup in 2013 and only made the switch to a crypto-powered network in 2019) and the network, which Mong said belongs to the Helium community.  “We wanted to make the distinction very clear,” Mong told CoinDesk.  The open-source technology will be governed by a new foundation, The Helium Foundation, which will oversee the rights to the brand, Mong said.  “It will be community-run, community-driven, community-owned and -governed,” Mong said. “And Nova Labs, the original creators, not only are we still participants but we’re still investing in driving growth and innovation.”",POSITIVE,HNT,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | HNT,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/30/helium-becomes-nova-labs-after-raising-200m-in-fresh-capital,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6b8cff8c8a5e9698bc8e8412c67a6cd3ee4d6b57-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The analyst also slightly cut the company&apos;s 2022 revenue estimate to $263M from $264M previously. Expects 2022 EBITDA at $124M vs. $131M in the prior view.

The comments come as European Union lawmakers are expected to pass controversial proposals that could outlaw anonymous crypto transactions and cut off unregulated exchanges from the financial system, which they are due to discuss Thursday.  “It would be ideal from a social viewpoint to intervene and have a less tolerant approach towards these activities,” said Panetta, who is a member of the ECB’s executive board, to a meeting of the European Parliament’s Economic Affairs Committee. He said, bitcoin-type activities were “pure gambling, wasting enormous amounts of energy.”  The crypto assets are “not used for payments, do not pay any dividend” and have “no economic activity behind them,” he said. “They have no social role.”  “The difficulty is how to intervene with this,” he said. “It certainly would require a coordinated international effort.”  His remarks came in response to a question from socialist EU lawmaker Eero Heinäluoma of Finland, who said that Russia was accepting bitcoin (BTC) “as a tool to circumvent sanctions.”  Just two weeks ago, lawmakers on the committee narrowly voted against measures that could have imposed restrictions on currencies such as bitcoin due to the environmental impact of the proof-of-work technology it uses.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/30/ecb-official-calls-for-less-tolerant-approach-to-bitcoin-gambling,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/88d7b6a7da8746dfce5b4b5c313944e47534151c-2500x2000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374992,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw4p0Z,1648651318,"Small Digital Euro Payments Won’t Need Laundering Checks, ECB Official Says","A potential new digital euro would allow anonymous transactions for small payments in spite of anti-money laundering (AML) norms, a leading member of the European Central Bank (ECB) said.  The suggestion made by ECB Executive Board member Fabio Panetta on Wednesday of giving a special treatment to the central bank digital currency (CBDC) stands in contrast to proposed rules for private cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, where lawmakers are debating a plan to outlaw privacy for even low-value transactions.  Normally, financial transactions are subject to checks called “know your customer,” or KYC – meaning that financial institutions have to check the identity of those involved to ensure funds aren’t being laundered or used to fund crime.  Panetta, the official leading work on the digital euro, today said he was prepared to soften those rules for people using any putative new digital currency issued by the ECB, at least in the case of small payments.  “A greater degree of privacy could be considered for lower-value online and offline payments"" made using the digital euro, Panetta told lawmakers on the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee Wednesday.  ""These payments could be subject to simplified AML/CFT checks,"" he added, referring to EU rules against money laundering and terrorism financing.  The EU has strict rules on protecting personal data, and privacy protections are the number one feature Europeans want in a digital euro, according to a 2021 ECB survey. ECB experts have floated ideas like “anonymity vouchers” that would allow people to shield a limited value of transactions from the authorities.  But more detailed research published today and based on focused discussions with panels of EU citizens put more emphasis on universal acceptance and security checks like iris recognition.  ""We have investigated various options to address the trade-off between retaining a high degree of privacy and other important public policy objectives,"" Panetta said.  But they come in the week that the EU prepares to end the possibility for anonymous crypto payments altogether. The European Parliament is due to vote Thursday on how to extend existing money laundering controls to crypto payments. An existing threshold of EUR 1,000 ($1,100) under which a payer’s details don’t have to be recorded seems likely to be scrapped for virtual assets, as lawmakers say it’s too easy to circumvent the rules by splitting up large payments.  The ECB is currently investigating whether to issue the digital currency. A formal ECB decision to move ahead, as well as draft legislation that could underpin the move, are expected next year.

The miner’s stock tumbled more than 30% on Monday post-market and was down a similar amount on Tuesday morning to $6.92 after the company reported fourth-quarter revenue and earnings that both came in well short of the analysts' consensus estimate. Stronghold also said that it will miss its original target of reaching 8.0 exahash per second of capacity by the end of the year.  Compass Point’s White said the miss was largely driven by a substantially lower capacity utilization and higher cost at its Scrubgrass power plant in Pennsylvania. uncertainty around receiving new miners from MinerVa.

Burrow is a non-custodial liquidity pool platform that functions as a decentralized money market, allowing users to supply and borrow assets for trading.  It comes as NEAR and a slew of next-gen blockchains look to stand up vibrant decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems – often with the help of hefty incentive programs.  Other investors in the Burrow round include Lemniscap, Mentha Partners, Warburg Serres Investments, DeFi Capital, D1 Ventures, GFS Ventures, SevenX Ventures and Metaweb Ventures.  The platform will use the funds to bootstrap its initial trading liquidity.  Given its use of the NEAR blockchain, Burrow says it will have “near-zero transaction costs” and fast transaction closing time, solving two complaints that many users have when trading on other blockchains.  ""We believe decentralized money markets act as a cornerstone for DeFi given their composability and utility,"" Anjan Vinod, Vice President at ParaFi Capital, said in a note to CoinDesk. ""By building natively on NEAR, we believe Burrow can integrate with other NEAR-native DeFi primitives including DEXs, liquid staking solutions, and stablecoins.""  Burrow currently supports NEAR, DAI, USDT, USDC, ETH and wBTC for deposits and wrapped assets like stNEAR, stETH, stSOL and stFTM for staking.  Burrow says that it will launch a governance token staking program in its second month.

42374996,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw4p5b,1648647089,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Trades at Discount in Japanese Yen Markets,"Good morning, and welcome to First Mover, our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Sign up here to get it in your inbox each weekday morning.  Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Bitcoin trades at a discount in the JPY markets.  Derivatives Insight: Open interest in AAVE soars.  And check out the CoinDesk TV show “First Mover,” hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern time.  Damanick Dantes, markets reporter, CoinDesk  Charlotte Principato, financial services analyst, Morning Consult  Rep. Stephen Lynch, Massachusetts (D)  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  While the Japanese yen's recent slide has scared the country's energy buyers, the investor community seems to be impervious to the heightened fiat currency volatility.  The yen depreciated 8% to 125 per U.S. dollar in three weeks ended on Monday before recovering to 121 per dollar early today, although it is still down 6% for the month and the year. Several analysts are worried that the Federal Reserve's plans to deliver rapid-fire rate hikes and the Bank of Japan's persistent easing bias could see the yen weakening to 150 per dollar within 12 months.  Even so, bitcoin is trading at a discount in the Japanese yen market, according to data tracked by Paris-based Kaiko Research. The spread between the BTC/USD and BTC/JPY markets flipped to negative early this month as the yen started to lose ground.  In other words, bitcoin doesn't seem to be drawing sasfe-haven bids from investors exposed to the slide in the Japanese yen. The cryptocurrency is widely perceived as a gold-like store-of-value asset and traded at a 6% premium on Binance’s Ukrainian hryvnia (UAH) market following Russia's invasion in February.  According to Daisuke Kobayashi, strategic financial officer at Tokyo-based fintech software and IT business systems provider xWIN, the widespread belief that a weak yen is a boon for stock markets seems to be keeping haven demand for bitcoin under check.  ""Only a few Japanese investors have noticed [the yen fall],"" Kobayashi told CoinDesk in a LinkedIn chat. ""There is also a welcoming mood, which is wrong, as they believe that a weaker yen will raise the price of stocks.""  Historically, there has been a near-linear relationship between the yen and Japanese stocks. BOJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda told Parliament last week that ""there is no change to my view that a weak yen is generally positive for Japan’s economy.""  Thus, the absence of premium in the BTC/JPY market is not surprising – more so as the yen is a G-7 currency and a far stronger unit than Ukraine's hryvnia, considering it is backed by forex reserves of $1.38 trillion, the second largest in the world. Further, according to Kobayashi, crypto forms a small portion of an average Japanese investor's portfolio.  ""The 1.18 trillion yen ($9.8 billion) worth of cryptocurrency held by users at Japanese exchanges as of January was also a fraction of Coinbase's $278 billion in December,"" a Nikkei Asia article dated March 22 said.  That said, crypto adoption may boom, not just in Japan, but also elsewhere in Asia and other parts of the world, if the rising bond yields force the Bank of Japan to abandon its six-year-old yield curve control program, under which it allows the 10-year government bond yields to move 25 basis points (0.25 percentage point) around the 0% target.  The BOJ has led the Fed and other advanced nation central banks in implementing extra ordinary measures by a decade or so. Besides, the curve control program running since 2016 has indirectly kept yields under control in Asia and in advanced nations. Hence, if the Japanese central bank abandons curve control, there could be a sharp rise in yields and risk aversion. Perhaps, markets may take that as a hint of an eventual failure of unconventional tools across the globe.  The 10-year Japanese yield has recently challenged the 0.25% mark several times, because of inflation fears and rising global yields. The two-year German yield has turned positive for the first time since 2015.  That has forced the BOJ to step up purchases. Early Monday, the BOJ said it would buy unlimited bonds for four days to ensure the yield remains under 0.25%. The central bank can keep printing money for decades, but will the market react as intended? The law of diminishing marginal utility seems to be catching up, as evident from the upticks in bond yields.  Investors can no longer ignore the developments in Japan.

Despite the eye-watering sum, however, experts told CoinDesk in a series of interviews that it’s unlikely the attacker will ever get to enjoy their ill-gotten gains.  On Tuesday, Axie developer Sky Mavis announced in a blog post that the exploit resulted in losses of over 173,000 ETH and 25.5 million USDC, worth more than $625 million at the time of publication.

Because these platforms have know-your-customer (KYC) verification systems, these deposits could be used to discover the hacker’s identity and ultimately force them to return the funds.  “If I was in their shoes, I would seek to get out of this situation as quickly as possible,” blockchain analytics firm Elliptic co-founder Tom Robinson told CoinDesk. “That might include returning the funds.”  Know your exploiter  The attacker’s current method of trying to launder funds through centralized exchanges struck a range of experts across the industry as odd.  “It’s unusual to see such direct flows of funds from thefts to large exchanges,” Robinson said. “They might have purchased accounts, or they could be using an intermediary to launder on their behalf.”  In an exclusive from October, CoinDesk found that there is a flourishing black market for KYC’d accounts at centralized exchanges. However, Robinson noted that the exchanges being used, including FTX and Crypto.com, have strong reputations for regulatory compliance and KYC.  In all, he characterized the attacker’s current efforts to launder their funds as “surprisingly naive.”  “That doesn’t quite match with the sophistication that it would seemingly require to compromise these validators and get their private keys,” he added.  A more common strategy from exploiters is to use a mixer like Tornado Cash, send stolen funds through non-KYC’d exchanges and generally “not rushing to cash out everything straight away, maybe waiting years even,” said Robinson.  Indeed, the broader crypto community has expressed befuddlement at the attacker’s laundering strategy.  As is often the case in the aftermath of an attack, Ethereum users have been using the network to communicate with the attacker, and in one case an individual has attempted to give the attacker tips for how to better launder their ETH.  “Hello, [your] initial deposit was from Binance, be careful and be sure to use tornado.cash you must leave the funds in for multiple days or it can be traced,” they wrote to the attacker’s address as part of an Ethereum transaction. “Afterwards you should use stealthex.io to swap to other currencies over a long period of time. Thanks, feel free to tip / retire me.”  However, even with rigorous privacy-preserving tools and a careful plan, Robinson told CoinDesk it’s extraordinarily difficult to launder a sum as large as $600 million. Indeed, despite the alleged launderers taking a number of precautions over a period of years, U.S. officials seized $3.6 billion in bitcoin related to the 2016 Bitfinex hack just last month.  Fumbling the bag  If Axie does have information on the attacker, identifying hackers has proven to be a successful tactic for developers in the past.  When reached by CoinDesk, blockchain sleuthing firm Chainalysis declined to comment, citing involvement in the ongoing investigation.  You’re talking about GDP-sized figures acquired through hacks.  Last September, in one of the most colorful hacking incidents in blockchain history, developers of the Jay Pegs Auto Mart non-fungible token (NFT) drop successfully intimidated a hacker into returning funds by – among other tactics – ordering miso soup to their house.  Read more: $3M Was Stolen, but the Real Steal Is These Kia Sedonas, Say Anonymous Developers  Former Sushi Chief Technology Officer Joseph Delong, who was involved with the Jay Pegs negotiations, said that identifying a hacker can help “prevent an anonymous getaway” and will increase public pressure.  “People will get angry at you doxxing the attacker but those cryptoanarchists can go f**k themselves with their superiority complex,” Delong said in a Tuesday interview.  “Laundering $600 million, I don’t think it’s possible,” said Adrian Hetman, a DeFi expert at Immunefi, a bug bounty service. “The best-case scenario is instead of black-hatting your way into the protocol, you should use that knowledge to submit bugs on a bug bounty platform – you could easily become a millionaire.”  Sushi’s Delong also noted that giving the hacker options can be a useful tool, such as a “clear bounty program and partners like Immunefi to help.”  Indeed, Immunefi is among the slew of services that have emerged as DeFi and Web 3 look to secure the ecosystem from the rising tides of hacks. Immunefi alone has paid out $20 million in bug bounties, and currently has $120 million available for white hats, coding lingo for the benevolent opposite of black-hat hackers who abscond with stolen funds rather than reporting vulnerabilities.  History shows that attempting to steal and launder $625 million may have been the lowest-upside option for the attacker. Last August the hacker who managed to swipe $611 million from Poly Network ultimately returned the funds after deciding it would be impossible to cash out.  “I think either he gets caught, or he’s forced to return the funds. Or both,” said Hetman of the Ronin hacker.  Ideological motivations  In a worst-case scenario for Axie Infinity, however, the exploiter might not even care about the money at all.  “I think that – fundamentally – the ideology of the exploiter is the key thing to consider when you’re talking about GDP-sized figures acquired through hacks,” said Laurence E. Day, a blockchain developer and scholar. “If they’ve simply done it to send a message about vulnerability or ‘because-they-could, consequences be damned,’ the question ‘was it worth it’ depends on whether they consider that sufficient self-validation as to their skill.”  Day is intimately familiar with hackers looking to send a message. Last October, a protocol Day contributed to, Indexed Finance, was exploited by a Canadian teenage math prodigy, Andean “Andy” Medjedovic.  Read more: After ‘Stealing’ $16M, This Teen Hacker Seems Intent on Testing ‘Code Is Law’ in the Courts  Despite the team doxing Medjedovic and taking the case to court, the Canadian graduate student has thus far refused to return the funds. In a series of tweets from an account claiming to belong to Medjedovic, he framed the confrontation as a “duel” and a “fight to the death.”  While Medjedovic is currently a fugitive from the law, the incident has earned him significant notoriety, which may have been his primary motivation.  However, Day noted that if the Ronin hacker is interested in fame rather than money, even that end-goal currently appears to be a losing game: They may never be able to claim responsibility without getting caught.  “We’ve seen time and again that ego is the downfall of the people that pull off exploits, and I imagine it’d be quite hard to never be able to own up to it in the same way that negotiating a white-hat bounty and becoming a god in the eyes of the community would allow you to,” said Day.

42374994,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw4p35,1648645918,Aave’s Token Rockets 97% Since Upgrade Strengthening DeFi Capabilities,"Aave’s native token has surged nearly 97% since the protocol's version 3 (v3) upgrade earlier this month, data shows.  In the past 24 hours alone, AAVE prices rose 27% as demand for its tokens increased among traders. Open interest on AAVE-tracked futures – or the total number of contracts held by market participants – hovers at $210 million, while DeFi trackers show value locked on Aave increased 10% in the past week to $14 billion.  Price charts show AAVE broke above resistance at $170 and $200 on Tuesday to surge to current resistance at the $240 level. Relative Strength Index (RSI) readings, which measure the magnitude of price changes, suggest the rally was overextended and could see a correction to the $220 level, where support exists.  The moves came on the back of Aave’s v3 upgrade that went live on March 16, 2022. AAVE exchanged hands at $122 at the time, data shows.  Proposed initially in November 2021, Aave v3 introduced cross-chain “portals,” isolated markets, a “high efficiency” mode and other features for a better user experience to compete with other decentralized finance (DeFi) products in the crypto market.  Portals, one of the biggest improvements, allows users to swap assets from any blockchain from which Aave, whose name is the Finnish word for ""ghost,"" is deployed. Users can create “aTokens” – which represent deposits into Aave – on one chain and burn them on another. This further opens up the possibilities of on-chain trading strategies, such as yield arbitrage.  Some analysts said the new features improve trust for Aave’s products in the broader market.  “The growth is fueled by the trust in the protocol with the new features added which include allowing assets to seamlessly flow between Aave v3 markets over different networks,” said Egor Volotkovich, director of cross-chain solutions EVODeFi, in a Telegram message.  “Investors understand that with Aave v3, [decentralized finance] lending will be more accessible and secure, and hence will want to continually accumulate the token now that it is far below its all-time highs,” Volotkovich added. AAVE reached lifetime highs of $661 in May 2021 and is currently 64% below those levels.  An added benefit to Aave users in version 3 is the deep liquidity that the platform now provides, some pointed out. ""Aave is typically seen as a lending protocol. However, they've focused on building deep liquidity on multiple blockchains,"" explained Ermin Nurovic, co-founder of asset management platform dHEDGE, in an email to CoinDesk.  ""As a result, they're now perfectly positioned for cross-chain transactions. This is something the market didn't earlier price in,"" Nurovic added.  Aave v3 was deployed across six different blockchains, with a seventh – Ethereum mainnet – forthcoming at an unspecified date, as reported.  In a separate catalyst earlier this month, Brazil’s central bank included Aave among nine partners to build out its central bank digital currency (CBDC). The list also features banking giant Santander Brazil and crypto exchange Mercado Bitcoin.  AAVE was trading at $236 at the time of writing and has a market capitalization of over $3.1 billion.",POSITIVE,AAVE,AAVE | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/30/aaves-token-rockets-97-since-upgrade-as-v3-strengthens-defi-capabilities,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/18ba30530e9710aad744f2cb6d33f105dac3600a-1550x1092.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Besides supporting the Axie Infinity team and law enforcement in the investigation, Binance said it has suspended all deposits and withdrawals on the Ronin network and blocked potential hacker addresses, with a dedicated monitoring team watching for any unusual transactions.  In addition, Binance has paused withdrawals of wrapped ether (wETH) on the Ethereum network, and the convert function from wETH to ETH.

Metaverse ecosystem GuildFi, Merit Circle and Yield Guild Games also participated.  The funding will help the company aggressively scale the team, which currently stands at over 20, and invest in NFTs.  “A lot of NFT companies out there need to continually create and sell more NFTs to generate revenue. But with this funding, for the next two to three years, we can let all of the NFTs in our ecosystem be earned or obtained by players without us having to charge for them,” Nicholas Kneuper, Crypto Raiders CEO and co-founder, told CoinDesk in an interview.  The Crypto Raiders fundraise adds to rising interest in blockchain gaming. Last month, crypto exchange giant FTX launched its own gaming unit and quickly announced its first acquisition.  ‘Play-to-own’  Crypto Raiders came to life last year when Knueper and co-founders David Titarenco and Matt Powell saw an RPG-shaped gap in the NFT gaming market.  The art in Crypto Raiders has a retro look and the gameplay is meant to evoke RPG classics like RuneScape and World of Warcraft. Players go into dungeons, fight enemies, search for better loot and work to level up their character. Players can go to battle in player-versus-player (PVP).  Read more: Animoca Brands, Ubisoft Invest in $12M Round for Blockchain Game 'Cross the Ages'  Crypto Raiders players can buy, sell and trade in-game assets, a hallmark of play-to-earn games. However, the company prefers the term “play-to-own” since it emphasizes the ownership aspect rather than the potential financial transaction.  “To us, [play-to-earn] really sounds like a job more than a game. We’re trying to build something that true gamers are going to love and enjoy,” Kneuper continued.  Roadmap  “We’re in the process of porting our game engine over to Unity, and that’s going to be a big upgrade, especially in terms of our developing more quickly,” said Kneuper, referring to a game engine owned by Epic Games that’s widely used in the industry.  In the next two weeks, Crypto Raiders will add features to the game so that players can bring different abilities into battles. There will also be an energy system to force players to decide whether or not to use energy-intensive abilities.  The in-game auction house will launch in the coming months for players to sell their gear. Crypto Raiders has plans to expand the farming side of the game, such as collecting herbalism supplies to craft potions or ore to forge weapons.  “Crypto Raiders has taken an innovative path in building a Web3 dungeon crawler and RPG experience that players truly enjoy while also providing avenues for players to ‘play-to-own’,” said Ryan Foo, game economist from Delphi Ventures, in a press release.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MATIC | SPONSORED,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/30/defiance-capital-delphi-digital-co-lead-6m-round-for-crypto-raiders-game,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/487dc7659b7148858041df499e80892cad16d414-632x514.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

While the entire crypto market confidently began the fall wave in November, the ROSE price was able to update the historical high in early January 2022. So, starting from 17 January, the price correction still began. However, the ROSE cryptocurrency movement in the growth channel continues. https://www.tradingview.com/x/KqlvkByg/ At the moment, sellers have been able to lower the price only to the middle line of the growth channel and test the range of $0.225. This liquidity range is interesting because, in the period from September to November 2021, buyers could not take it under control. It was the $0.225 range that slowed down the growth trend of buyers. The test of this range on low volumes and &apos;peaceful&apos; non-aggressive candles shows the absence of a large seller in the ROSE market. This fact gives the right to consider a positive scenario - the formation of a new growth wave with the final target of $0.6. However, there is no certainty that buyers have already gained enough of their positions in the local consolidation of $0.225-$0.315. Therefore, the probability of returning the price to $0.225 is quite high. This will be a good chance for conservative investors to buy ROSE with low risks.

42423637,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2cKZh,1648630817,Bitcoin Holds Steady as Luna Foundation Guard Resumes Purchases,"Bitcoin (BTC) remains on the hunt for a move above the 200-day average as Luna Foundation Guard (LFG), a non-profit organization focused on UST, resumed buying the largest cryptocurrency after taking a break on Tuesday.  LFG has purchased 5,773 BTC, worth $272 million, this week, the foundation's confirmed bitcoin address showed at 09:42 UTC (5:42 a.m. ET). Nearly half was purchased on Monday and the rest a few minutes before press time. Last week, it acquired about $125 million of BTC each week day.  ""The foundation had a trading hiatus after Monday's big purchase. It is back today [snapped up 2,943 BTC],"" Arcane Research's Vetle Lunde told CoinDesk in a Twitter chat. ""Last week, LFG sent $125 million worth of USDT across all weekdays and $160 million on Saturday to Jump Trading, who executed the BTC trades quickly thereafter."" USDT is the symbol for tether, the world's largest stablecoin by market value.  LFG announced last month that it had raised $1 billion through an over-the-counter sale of LUNA, the native token of the Terra blockchain, to build a bitcoin-denominated reserve as an additional layer of security for Terra's decentralized dollar-pegged stablecoin UST, the fourth-largest stablecoin. The funding round was led by Jump Crypto and Three Arrows Capital.  The foundation increased the size of its bitcoin reserve to $3 billion early this month and has been using tether to purchase BTC. Tether helps users bypass market volatility by maintaining a 1:1 peg with the U.S. dollar.  ""The reserve will help maintain a UST peg to the dollar during downward peg deviations,"" Lunde told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. The coin has been able to retail the dollar peg by issuing and destroying LUNA tokens. For every UST created, $1 worth of Luna is burned on the Terra blockchain.  LFG has accumulated 30,728 BTC worth $1.45 billion, topping the initial target of $1 billion. The foundation's Ethereum address now has stablecoins worth $848 million, which can be used to fund further BTC purchases. It could get an additional $800 million by converting its UST holdings to tether.  While there is no formula or frequency for executing purchases and no deadline for building the reserve, the process would be completed in the next two weeks if LFG reverted to it previous buying pattern.  ""If LFG continues to buy at a similar rate as last week and the $800 million is not converted, LFG will finalize building the BTC reserve on April 6. Assuming a stable BTC price of $47,000 until April 6, LFG will have 48,800 BTC in its reserve once finished,"" Lunde said in Tuesday's blog post.  ""If LFG also spends its $800 million UST reserves on BTC, this process will be finalized around April 14, with a further *~17,000 BTC being added to the reserve, leading the reserves to reach 65,000 BTC,"" Lunde added.  The implication is that, at least for the short term, the path of least resistance for bitcoin appears to be on the higher side. Terraform Labs founder and CEO Do Kwon recently tweeted that LFG could eventually increase the size of the reserve to $10 billion.  Bitcoin was last trading near $47,500, little changed on the day. The cryptocurrency rose nearly 13.5% last week, the biggest single-week percentage rise since April 2021, data provided by charting platform TradingView show. According to Arcane Research, LFG's purchases probably contributed to lifting the market and the foundation's activity must be closely tracked in coming days.  UPDATE (March 30, 10:06 UTC): Updates LFG's weekly purchase to 5,773 BTC from 2,830 BTC following fresh inflows into the foundation's bitcoin address.",POSITIVE,BTC | LUNA | USDT,BTC | FIAT | LUNA | TRADING | USDT,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/30/bitcoin-holds-steady-as-luna-foundation-guard-slows-purchases,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/481f4e89473f1c78c319ca36d0a2beb3ba329978-1920x1088.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Called ShibaDEX, the cross-chain exchange runs on AtomicDEX instead of a single network, such as Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain. This allows for the trading of Shiba Inu tokens for other assets on different networks.  “ShibaDEX is a bridge that links together all the Shiba Inu community tokens and top meme coins,” Komodo Chief Technology Officer Kadan Stadelmann wrote in an email to CoinDesk. “It’s also a bridge that links Shiba Inu to blockchain communities outside of the Shiba Inu sphere and into the wider crypto metaverse.”  DEXs rely on smart contracts and liquidity pools to let global users exchange cryptocurrencies with each other in a permissionless manner, unlike centralized exchanges.  However, DEXs have certain inherent risks such as impermanent loss or rogue developers emptying liquidity pools in a “rug pull.”  ShibaDEX uses atomic swaps to tackle such issues, it claims. When trading on ShibaDEX, users' funds are swapped via decentralized order books rather than adding or removing funds via a centralized liquidity pool.  Users can store and trade SHIB (ERC-20 and BEP-20 versions), LEASH, BONE and more from the non-custodial ShibaDEX wallet. ShibaDEX users can trade SHIB with BTC, ETH, BNB, MATIC and many other assets natively across their respective blockchains.

Will buyers retain trend control? Key technical points: AXS prices break above the $65 mark. The gaming token prices sustain above the 100-day EMA. Finally, the 24-hour trading volume of Axie Infinity is $1.013 Billion, marking a 35% rise. Past Performance of AXS AXS coin prices give a bullish breakout of the consolidation range formed above the $50 mark with a price jump of 11% on 23rd March. The rally gains 50% within 72 hours, resulting in the $65 breakout. However, the breakout rally fails to surpass the 200-day EMA resulting in the breakout retest.

Solana, Polygon, StarkEx, Ronin, Celo, Nervos, IXO and Bitcoin will join Ethereum, the Norwegian company said. Crypto Ecosystem Lead Susie Batt told CoinDesk that Opera’s desktop crypto browser can now access Polygon and will “soon” plug into the rest. All are available on Opera for Android but there was no timeline on iOS.  Opera is not the only crypto-oriented browser betting on an explosion in Web 3 users. Brave has also launched a built-in crypto wallet, with plans to support more blockchains. These efforts would give their users more opportunities to interact with different decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems, including layer 2, or companion, chains.  “Providing environmentally conscious solutions for our users is a key mission for Opera and moving activity on to layer 2 goes a long way to minimizing users' carbon footprint,” Batt said in an email. “We see this as the potential missing block from the mass adoption of Web 3.”  Read more: Opera Releases Web 3 Browser Ahead of Cross-Chain Wallet Launch  Opera, one of the original web browsers, has been building crypto products for its about 350 million users since 2018.

That’s where Opera excels,” said Batt.  Blockchain networks are not without risk. Ronin’s Tuesday disclosure of a $625 million hack raises questions about safety and security, especially on token bridges.  “Privacy and security of our users are our highest priority,” Batt said, noting that users should understand the risk of an ecosystem still in its infancy.
