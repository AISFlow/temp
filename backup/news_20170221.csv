42427388,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKB5Lh,1487709177,"Bitcoin Price Tops $1,000 For Longest Stretch in History","Bitcoin has now been trading above $1,000 for more than seven days, enjoying its longest-ever stretch above this key psychological level and providing traders with new evidence of support at this price, CoinDesk data reveals.  Overall, the price of bitcoin has been trading north of $1,000 since mid-day on 14th February, according to the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), though it tested this level at times over the seven-day, 15-hour stretch.  Bitcoin prices have even rallied in the last few sessions, surpassing $1,100 earlier today and reaching a six-week high.  At the time of the report, bitcoin was trading at $1,115.70, up 3% for the day.  Looking back, the current run compares favorably to other positive periods of bitcoin trading, dating back to 2013, when it first tested highs above $1,000.  Bitcoin prices remained above $1,000 for roughly two days from 29th November to 30th November that year, and again from 3rd December to 4th December, periods that saw huge volatility in the bitcoin price.  Bitcoin prices 1st November, 2013 to 1st January, 2014  Prior to this run, bitcoin's longest period above $1,000 was from 2nd February to 9th February of this year, when it may have spent as much as six days, 23 hours above the mark.  Data from the BPI suggests that during this period, the price may have fallen below $1,000 on single exchanges, though averages were higher. Data from 3rd February, for instance, indicates a low of $995.87.  Bitcoin prices 2nd February to 9th February, 2017  In the meantime, it remains to be seen how strong the support for bitcoin above $1,000 will be.  Petar Zivkovski, COO of leveraged cryptocurrency trading platform Whaleclub, spoke to this strong performance, noting that traders have so far strongly resisted any movements back below this mark.  ""The only pullback we've seen on the rise above $1,000 is from $1,070 to $1,040, which is a healthy sign of bullishness,"" he said.  Cryptocurrency fund manager Jacob Eliosoff said that he believes the price is more stable than it was both in January of this year and in 2013.  ""That's not saying much though. I remain very worried about the state of bitcoin's development and culture, and I won't be at all surprised if we drop back to $900 or $800 in the next few months,"" he said.  Eliosoff emphasized the ongoing developments surrounding Chinese exchange withdrawals and the upcoming SEC decision about the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF were two big points of uncertainty.  ""After the dust settles on those, one way or another, price stability should come a little easier,"" he said.

42427384,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKB5Dh,1487707235,Decentralized Web Gets Visual Aid With New Blockstack Explorer,"Blockstack has released a new visual tool that gives a window into its budding bitcoin-powered internet.  The blockchain explorer, launched today as the 'Blockstack Explorer', gathers information about Blockstack's domain name network, including its new "".id"" and "".iot"" domains, into a visual display for the first time.  As reported by CoinDesk, Blockstack is one of a number of projects seeking to leverage the bitcoin blockchain to build a new decentralized internet, one that will remove centralized servers and have its own dedicated browser.  While that's not quite in place today, users now have a transparent view of a domain's ownership history, which includes domain search functionalities grouped by name, address and block number.  Launched in 2013 as OneName, Blockstack made its start by embedding identification information directly into the bitcoin blockchain. Formerly utilizing the Namecoin blockchain, Blockstack began using the bitcoin in 2016, later recounting its lessons learned in a white paper.  Now the company is working to develop a full technology stack with a single, unified platform that developers can use to build a new network of sites.  The company has successfully raised $5.3m from investors in three public rounds, according to data from Crunchbase.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Blockstack.

42427376,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKB4xh,1487697632,California Lawmakers Consider Barring Bitcoin from Charity Raffles,"A lawmaker in California has proposed prohibiting the use of bitcoin and other digital currencies in charitable raffles held by both private and non-profit organizations.  California Senate Bill 741, submitted late last week by Senator Tony Mendoza, creates the regulatory framework for ""private, nonprofit organizations"" that would govern how these entities are able to hold raffles at sporting events, county fairs and other public venues.  Notably, the measure would ban bitcoin from use as payment in those sanctioned raffles.  The bill states:  ""A raffle ticket shall not be sold in exchange for bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency.""  The measure goes on to prohibit the use of the internet to either conduct or sell tickets for a raffle, indicating that California lawmakers want to limit such events to physical locations. While not outlined in the bill, it's possible that cybersecurity and identity issues are behind the push.  The language mirrors a bill that amended the rules for sports organizations wishing to hold a raffle. That measure, too, prohibited the use of bitcoin for this purpose. The bill cleared the state legislature and was approved by the governor's office in late 2015.  SB 741 represents the latest legislative move related to bitcoin and blockchain in recent weeks, with lawmakers in states like North Dakota, Arizona and Hawaii, all weighing in on different bills related to the tech.

42427372,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKB4rh,1487694071,Automaker Daimler AG Joins Hyperledger Blockchain Project,"Daimler AG, the parent company of luxury car maker Mercedes-Benz, has joined the Linux Foundation led Hyperledger project.  The firm announced today that it had joined up with the initiative. Daimler is the second high-profile member to join Hyperledger this year. Late last month, credit card giant American Express announced that it had become part of the project.  Daimler AG CIO Jan Brecht said in a statement:  “We see blockchain as a promising technology, not fully mature yet, but continuously growing. Now is the right time to get into it, build up knowledge and form a network of like-minded people to share experiences. By joining Hyperledger, we are confident to do the right step towards this direction.”  As part of the move, Jonas von Malottki, an IT executive for Daimler, will join the Hyperledger governing board.  The entry into Hyperledger is Daimler's first major foray into the blockchain space, though there appear to be some connections between the firm and the technology more broadly.  Last month, the conglomerate acquired European payment service PayCash, which supports bitcoin payments. While not explicitly tied to work with blockchain, the acquisition is part of a plan to develop in-car payment services.

42427385,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKB5Fh,1487691036,New Ethereum Blockchain Consortium Could Run on Experimental Tech,"An enterprise consortium is exploring the possibility of using blockchain-based governance technology to help its members vote on various measures.  According to sources, the newly formed Enterprise Ethereum group is considering a more distributed approach to self-management, rather than the more traditional leadership structure adopted by competing blockchain consortia like R3CEV and Hyperledger.  As reported  by CoinDesk last month, Enterprise Ethereum is a consortium-style group of companies looking to build private implementations of ethereum with an eye to also help improve the public version of the technology.  CoinDesk has been told that the founding members of that group – rumored to include JP Morgan, Santander and BNY Mellon – are currently considering using smart contracts to effectively build its decision-making process into the ethereum blockchain.  Called the 'EntEth Technical Governance Mechanism', the distributed board membership and voting platform would be supported by tech provided by BoardRoom, a decentralized governance platform, if approved by the nascent organization.  First publicly revealed in 2015 at the ethereum developers' conference DevCon, BoardRoom is a part of the group of companies, or 'spokes', built around the ConsenSys ethereum startup.  At its core, BoardRoom is a smart contract on the ethereum network designed to let individuals, companies and other groups manage other contracts on both the public and private instances of ethereum.  The company, founded by developer Nick Dodson and advised by ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin, offers its users the ability to collaboratively manage jointly owned digital assets and conduct proxy voting on board proposals.  Boardroom advisor Joe Lubin and founder of ethereum startup ConsenSys confirmed to CoinDesk that the consortium is currently exploring a number of possible governance structures ""at different levels of the organization"".  He added:  ""No final decisions have been made.""

42427377,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKB4zh,1487685772,EU Parliament Report Explores Blockchain's 'Substantial Impact',"The EU Parliament's in-house research office has published a wide-ranging new report on blockchain technology.  Aimed at providing an educational framework for members of the EU's legislative branch, the report explores use cases including digital currency, patent protection, e-voting and smart contracts.  Researchers working for the EU Parliament have explored aspects of the tech in the past. For example, a think tank sponsored by the Parliament analyzed how the technology's ability to secure data could ensure election transparency in a paper published in October.  That topic and others are touched upon in the new research paper, which projects that blockchain could significantly impact society.  The authors write:  ""Although blockchains are not the solution for every problem, and even if they will not revolutionize every aspect of our lives, they could have a substantial impact in many areas, and it is necessary to be prepared for the challenges and opportunities they present.""  The paper goes on to suggest several possible avenues for EU lawmakers, who last year approved an EU Commission-led task force focused on the tech. The Commission – the bloc's executive branch – has indicated recently that it plans to ramp up blockchain R&D.  The paper encourages further exploration here, positing that regulators could grant legal legitimacy to blockchain transactions – an idea that lawmakers in other parts of the world have pursued in the past.  Ultimately, the paper's authors feel the tech could deliver benefits to EU citizens, even if it proves to be applicable only in certain cases.  ""While the most idealistic and revolutionary visions of blockchain development will probably remain no more than visions, even moderate implementation of blockchain may still promote some degree of redistribution and transparency,"" the authors state.

42427386,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKB5Hh,1487678461,Bitcoin Prices Hit Six-Week High as Traders Await ETF Decision,"The price of bitcoin continued to inch closer to annual highs set in January today, as prices for the asset passed $1,100 across global exchanges.  At press time, bitcoin was trading at $1,105.18, its highest total since 5th January – the day its most recent price rally collapsed, falling $200 in one hour. The drop, credited by some to the over-influence of leverage in the market, later sparked an investigation into the market by the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank.  However, traders are looking elsewhere in an effort to understand this latest price rise.  Sources told CoinDesk today that they believe the price increase is the result of traders ""pricing in"" an 11th March ruling that could see the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF become the first bitcoin ETF in the US market, opening the digital currency to a wider audience of investors.  OTC trader Zhao Dong credited the increase to ""optimism about the ETF approval"", as did exchange operators and market analysts. Not everyone is optimistic about the path ahead, however.  Blockchain consultant and advisor George Samman, for example, expects the price to edge downward prior to the approval, as traders look to sell ahead of a possible rejection. Research from investment analyst Needham & Co has found that the bitcoin ETF has a less than 25% chance of being approved.  Still, the research firm projects that bitcoin prices could rise dramatically on the off-chance a positive decision is made, perhaps prompting demand for bitcoin in advance of this date.

42427383,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKB5Bh,1487674853,Swift is Recruiting Banks for Blockchain Tests,"Global financial messaging service provider Swift is seeking to recruit other financial institutions to join its ongoing blockchain R&D initiative.  At a meeting at Swift's New York headquarters last week, Stephen Grainger, Swift’s head of sales for North America, told an audience of banks, consulting firms and media companies that a major announcement will be made shortly regarding the program.  Grainger told the audience:  ""There’s a framework for how banks will sign up to that and we’ll make a further announcement towards the end of Q1 about who will participate in that process.""  According to Swift, recruits will include banks with strong liquidity practices for its proof of concept (PoC), which is aimed at replacing the antiquated nostro and vostro account system of settling cross border payments.  The theory is that, by eliminating the dormant foreign exchange reserves held on the books of other banks, participants in the PoC will see a higher rate of return to shareholders since they are able to put the nostro/vostro capital into interest-earning assets.  The bank believes that following the release of its criteria guidelines, as many as 100 banks will join the project. The firm has also said it plans to allow developers to access this special program’s APIs during a hackathon this October.
