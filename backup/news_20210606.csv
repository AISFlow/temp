42387001,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBWBHd,1623013941,Crypto Long & Short: Bitcoin's Taproot Update Shows How It's Not Like Gold,"Bitcoin's strongest narrative is ""digital gold."" Investors buy it not out of an expectation that it will behave like gold behaves in the market today, but that it will some day take on the historic importance that gold has held across cultures and ages.      My colleague George Kaloudis recently reminded me that there's one important aspect in which bitcoin will never be like gold: In a vault or in the ground, gold will always be gold; bitcoin, however, is a technology, and a technology will be updated. This quality is now on display with the Bitcoin network's progress toward an update called Taproot. (Keep an eye out for George's forthcoming in-depth report on Taproot at coindesk.com/research.)      Taproot is a bundle of several improvement proposals. Notable among them, it would add data efficiencies that could ease supply-side pressure in Bitcoin's transaction-fee market. It also includes updates to multi-signature transactions, a Bitcoin feature that is significant for custodians and other organizations that take direct custody of bitcoin. In this column, I'll focus on the latter.      Multi-signature addresses are a governance tool for organizations that directly custody bitcoin. Taproot includes updates designed to make multi-sigs easier to use, and to improve their privacy: a multi-signature Taproot transaction cannot be distinguished from other Taproot transactions. This could be significant for organizations that require multi-signature transactions, but do not wish to advertise to the network that they are using them.      Bitcoin's pseudonymity has made it a target for criticism that the network can be used for criminal purposes. Pseudonymity also provides security for legitimate operators. On the internet, nobody knows you're a dog; on Bitcoin, nobody knows you're a financial institution. For organizations using the Bitcoin network, privacy reduces the likelihood of cyberattack.      This chart, adapted for readability from txstats.com, shows just how visible current multi-sig users are to the network. It also raises a question: With multi-sig growth at anemic levels, is there really demand to justify adding these features? (We discussed that question on CoinDesk TV's ""All About Bitcoin"" show last week.)      Multi-sig's shortcomings may be a barrier to adoption, which Taproot could address, opening the door to increased use. That could improve custodian services and make direct-custody forms of investment more attractive. Or, this could be a vaunted new feature that nobody will use. (Remember Microsoft Sets?)      Most technology investors understand the technology risk inherent in an update. (See Samsung Galaxy Note 7.) There's also the adoption risk of developing a feature that nobody uses. Unlike Ethereum, Bitcoin developers prefer backwards-compatible updates. After Taproot is implemented, users will still be able to use pre-Taproot transactions. This would be self-defeating for Taproot's multi-sig privacy features: pseudonymity only works in a crowd.      Improving multi-sigs also could make it easier to develop applications on top of Bitcoin, an especially relevant issue in 2021 as decentralized finance, non-fungible tokens and stablecoins have driven the cryptocurrency bull market. At this writing, the year-to-date returns on ether are roughly 10 times those of bitcoin.      At this point, it seems likely that Taproot will be enacted by the Bitcoin network, as more and more miners signal approval. Whether users take advantage of its features will be a telling test of bitcoin's adaptability and, by extension, its viability as an updatable technology investment.      On the other hand, a perceived inability to update or adapt may strengthen Bitcoin's resemblance to gold – which, after all, does neither.      Among events in Bitcoin's history, the Taproot update is receiving far less attention than, say, the Bitcoin halving, which occurred around this time last year. In the long run, it may prove more significant.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Galen Moore,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/06/crypto-long-short-bitcoins-taproot-update-shows-how-its-not-like-gold,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f6c8a3c5b293ceef124bc6153b87ac74835e2dd4-1420x947.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A Ruffer investment director said the firm sold its bitcoin because younger people would not be spending so much time trading now that the lockdowns are ending, according to The Sunday Times report.  “When the price doubled we took some profits for our clients in December and early January. We actively managed the position and by the time we sold the last tranche in April the total profit was slightly more than $1.1 billion,” Hamish Baillie, the investment director, said.  The firm invested 2.5% of its $27 billion portfolios into bitcoin in November and took profits earlier this year as the cryptocurrency more than doubled to around $40,000.  In February, Duncan MacInnes, the co-manager of Ruffer Investment, said the firm had around $700 million left in bitcoin as the company reported a profit of $750 million overall.

42386986,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBW7zp,1622990470,"Musk's Crypto Tweets 'Destroyed Lives,'  Anonymous Says as Hacker Group Targets Tesla CEO","A video on YouTube claiming to be from the hacker group Anonymous takes aim at Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, saying his tweets that have roiled the cryptocurrency markets have ""destroyed lives"" of hardworking people who've had ""their dreams liquidated over your public temper tantrums.""    Given the very nature and name of the decentralized hacker group, it's impossible to determine with 100% certainty the video was created by a member(s) of Anonymous. Still, the video bears all the hallmarks of past videos that are accepted as having been created by group members.  Wearing the group's trademark Guy Fawkes mask and using a voice changer, the narrator of the video accuses Musk of being little more than a James Bond villain, someone with a carefully cultivated image as a visionary that's a disguise for ""nothing more than another narcissistic rich dude who is desperate for attention.""  After taking issue with Musk's environmental and labor record, the video zeroed in on Musk's recent dabbling with cryptocurrencies and saying Musk only turned his back on bitcoin because he was afraid of Tesla losing government subsidies.  "" It is now widely believed you have been forced to denounce your company's involvement with bitcoin in order to keep that green government money flowing into Tesla's coffers,"" the video says.  The hacker group further calls Musk's recent move to create a bitcoin miner council an attempt to take control of the industry.  The video reserved some of its harshest comments for Musk's recent tweets that have helped wipe billions of dollars of value from the crypto market, saying, ""Millions of retail investors were really counting on their crypto gains to improve their lives. ... As hardworking people have their dreams liquidated over your public temper tantrums, you continue to mock them with memes from one of your million-dollar mansions.""  The video, which at press time has 1.2 million views, ends with a variation of the group's signature sign-off. ""You may think you are the smartest person in the room, but now you have met your match. We are Anonymous! We are Legion! Expect us.""  Despite numerous people having posted a copy of the video to Musk's Twitter feed, the Tesla CEO has yet to directly respond. However, Musk did post a tweet Saturday afternoon that could be interpreted as a response. In the tweet, Musk simply said, ""Don't kill what you hate. Save what you love."" In addition, Musk's profile picture was changed to a completely filled-in black circle that could be a reference to the color most associated with Anonymous.  But, then again, given Musk's history of enigmatic tweets, perhaps not.    The following is a transcript of the video:      “Greetings world,  This is a message from Anonymous, for Elon Musk.      For the past several years you have enjoyed one of the most favorable reputations of anyone in the billionaire class because you have tapped into the desire that many of us have to live in a world with electric cars and space exploration, but recently your carefully created public image is being exposed and people are beginning to see you as nothing more than another narcissistic rich dude who is desperate for attention.      It appears that your quest to save the world is more rooted in a superiority and savior complex than it is in actual concern for humanity. This has been obvious to your employees for a long time who have faced intolerable conditions under your command for years.      It is also obvious to the young children working in your overseas lithium mines which are destroying the local environment as well. You have been open about your willingness to stage coups in order to install dictators in places where your toxic products are being mined. You have even prematurely crowned yourself 'Emperor of Mars,' a place where you will be sending people to die.      Your fanboys overlook these issues because they are focused on the potential good that your projects can bring to the world but you are not the only show in town and your competition is growing more intense with each passing day.      There are plenty of other companies working on space exploration and electric vehicles, you are just the only CEO who has gained a cult following through sh*tposting and trolling the world on social media. In fact, many people are not learning that the vast majority of Tesla's income doesn't come from selling cars, it comes from government subsidies – selling carbon tax credits for your innovation with clean energy      This technically isn't your innovation though because you aren't actually the founder of Tesla. You simply purchased the company from two people much more intelligent than you are – Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning      Tesla has also made more money holding bitcoin for a few months than they did in years of selling cars.      It is also more than likely that this bitcoin was purchased with money from these government subsidies.      It is now widely believed you have been forced to denounce your company's involvement with Bitcoin in order to keep that green government money flowing into Tesla's coffers.      The energy use argument about proof-of-work mining is a very nuanced conversation that requires a fairly complex understanding of how power grids work and how excess energy is wasted by power companies and sought out by crypto miners.      This is a conversation that you have been having for over a year and were intimately aware of but as soon as your main source of income was threatened as your pretended to be clueless in an attempt to play both sides of the fence      Then, your move to create a bitcoin miner council was rightly seen as an attempt to centralize the industry and take it under your control.      Reading the comments on your Twitter posts, it seems that the games you have played with the crypto markets have destroyed lives.      Millions of retail investors were really counting on their crypto gains to improve their lives. This is something that you will never understand because you were born into the stolen wealth of a South African apartheid emerald mine and have no clue what struggle is like for most of the working people in the world.      Of course, they took the risk upon themselves when they invested, and everyone knows to be prepared for volatility in crypto, but your Tweets this week show a clear disregard for the average working person.      As hardworking people have their dreams liquidated over your public temper tantrums, you continue to mock them with memes from one of your million dollar mansions.      You may think you are the smartest person in the room, but now you have met your match.      We are Anonymous!      We are Legion!
