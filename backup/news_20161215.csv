ZEC tokens have never reached $40 before, so this price level would represent a new low for the digital currency.  Zcash has generated significant visibility since its launch, with supporters pointing to its zero-knowledge proofs, called zk-SNARKS, as a means of achieving greater privacy for transactions.  ZEC prices surged on their first trading day of 28th October, reaching approximately 3,300 BTC (more than $2 million) on Poloniex. However, the digital currency's price quickly declined, ultimately falling to 48 BTC that day.  Zcash has thus far failed to obtain adoption, and cryptocurrencies like Monero remain dominant on the Dark Web, where users derive significant benefit from maintaining privacy in their transactions. Since ZEC tokens have not obtained a meaningful use thus far aside from trading, some market observers have asserted that their value is, at present, purely speculative.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in the startup developing the open-source Zcash platform.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ZEC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING | XMR | ZEC,Charles Lloyd Bovaird II,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2016/12/15/zcash-nears-40-in-ongoing-price-decline,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/61b53fe9fd7c9527bdb831fa993098309110852b-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42379092,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mwkH,1481843753,Overstock Raises $10.9 Million in First Blockchain Stock Issuance,"Online retailer Overstock.com has closed the first-ever Series A preferred funding round with shares sold on a blockchain.  Of the total $10.9m raised from existing shareholders, about $1.9m was raised via shares traded on the tØ blockchian platform developed by Overstock.com subsidiary Medici.  The Series A consisted of 126,565 shares sold on the tØ blockchain platform for $15.68. A separate Series B consisted of 569,333 shares sold using traditional technology. The company had originally set out to raise as much as $30m from selling 2m shares.  Shares traded on the blockchain platform settle almost instantly, as opposed to the three days post-trade typically takes on a traditional exchange. The blockchain shares are also intended to help prevent third parties from trading on shares they don’t actually own.  Johnathan Johnson, Medici president and Overstock’s chairman of the board, told CoinDesk:  ""Overstock has demonstrated that shares can be issued and traded on the blockchain which ensures settling almost immediately. It gives other companies the opportunity to do the same.""  Trading of the stock on the tØ’s blockchain platform is expected to coincide with Nasdaq’s trading hours, which kick off at 9:30am ET and cease with the closing bell at 4pm ET.  Though the closing of the round today concludes a years-long effort, when the first-ever trading of shares on a blockchain-based platform commences in the coming days, the company’s work has only just begun, according to representatives.  While the tØ is currently configured so that it can only trade Overstock’s shares, Johnson said it will be customizable to other corporate offerings “in short order.”  ""If other companies want to use it to issue shares we’d love to take their call,"" he explained.  Blockchain vs. Wall Street  Founded in 2014, Medici is the formalization of Overstock founder and CEO Patrick Byrne’s bid to replace certain stock trading functions with distributed, cryptographic systems.  Specifically, Byrne has said he is seeking to combat a practice of what is called naked short-selling, in which investors drive down the price of a stock by shorting it using stocks they don’t actually own.  By issuing financial products on a blockchain, the argument goes, the practice can be prevented by prohibiting traders from taking action based on assets they don’t actually control.  To test that theory, Byrne purchased for $500k what he called the first-ever cryptosecurity using the tØ platformm back in June 2015. A month after that, Overstock sold a $5m cryptobond to FNY Accounts, a New York-based trading firm.  But the $1.9m raised today from shares sold on a blockchain marks the first time subscribers were allowed to invest directly in a company. Overstock (Nasdaq: OSTK) is currently valued at $455m and is trading at $17.95. The blockchain stock will trade under its own ticker symbol, OSTKP.  TØ co-founder John Tabacco helped introduce the platform at its formal launch at the Nasdaq offices in New York City last year and described the fund-raise as the culmination of Byrne’s vision.  He concluded:  ""Our team has etched that vision into capital markets history.""

The article was changed to reflect that this is the new ticker symbol for the blockchain-traded shares.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Michael del Castillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2016/12/15/overstock-raises-109-million-in-first-blockchain-stock-issuance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9295a1166eeb19dae6e6f8e249a1de72ca07b4e5-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42379095,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mwmn,1481830523,Japanese Blockchain Consortium Grows to More Than 100 Members,"A blockchain-focused consortium in Japan has quietly grown its membership to more than 100 companies.  Membership within the the Blockchain Collaborative Consortium (BCCC) has expanded since the effort first launched in April. BCCC members include Japan Microsoft, Mitsui Sumotomo Insurance, PwC, Bitbank and ConsenSys, among others.  The group also announced that the 100th student from its Blockchain Daigakko project had successfully graduated – a sign that the BCCC's previously declared plans to boost knowledge about the tech are bearing fruit.  In a blog post published today, Pina Hirano, the founder and CEO of founding BCCC member Infoteria described the Blockchain Daigakko (translated and Blockchain University in English) as the only of its kind in Japan and hinted that the consortium was working toward other education-oriented programs.  Hirano wrote:  ""While the world related to FinTech and block chains is moving at a rapid pace, BCCC will add new members' power and make activities more active so that domestic movements will not be delayed.""  While Hirano pegged the total consortium membership at 109, the BCCC website currently only lists 101.  Japan and blockchain  Over the past few months Japan has become a hotbed for blockchain exploration and concern.  In November distributed ledger startup Ripple launched its own blockchain consortium with 42 banks aimed at building a network capable of conducting cross-border payments in near real-time.  Earlier this month the Mizuho Financial Group, Inc., Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and other banks joined Deloitte Japan in the publication of results of a test of a blockchain-based inter-bank payments trial.  Yet despite the tests, Japan is said to have faced a shortage of blockchain developers, as reported by Reuters earlier this year.  To help solve such problems, the BCCC has graduated two classes of students offered up to 8 courses each, including “practical training” on the “foundation of blockchain technology” specifically including lessons on the bitcoin blockchain. The consortium’s 2-month long blockchain classes are also conducted in Japanese.  A third class is currently open for enrollment with courses to begin in January 2017.

42379086,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mwfF,1481821227,Wyre Raises $5.8 Million for Cross-Border Blockchain Payments,"San Francisco-based bitcoin startup Wyre has raised $5.8m in new funding.  The Series A round, which coincides with the stealth startup’s official launch, was led by Chinese venture firm Amphora Capital. Other investors include Chinese payments firms Baofoo.com and 9fBank, Draper Associates and Digital Currency Group. Wyre said it has raised $7.5m to date.  The startup’s main focus is cross-border payments, with a particular emphasis on those sent between China and the US. Wyre uses bitcoin (as well as other blockchains like ethereum and litecoin, among others) to settle transactions, acting as an intermediary between businesses in both countries. Among those firms is NihaoPay, a China-based eCommerce payments firm that plugs into services such as WechatPay and Alipay.  The startup, according to founder and CEO Michael Dunworth, is looking to capitalize on interest in money exchange between the two countries.  As such, today’s launch opens up the service to prospective customers in the US and China. Some of the newly-raised funds, he explained, will be used to support the launch of services in Europe and Latin America as well.  Wyre is far from alone in using the tech as a remittance rail, as other startups in the bitcoin space have been pursuing the same concept in different parts of the world – a process that hasn't been without its own complications. Larger financial firms, too, have been testing cross-border payments using the tech.  According to Dunworth, Wyre hopes to gain traction through simplifying the process by which businesses can tap bitcoin for use in cross-border payments without actually handling digital currencies themselves.  Dunworth told CoinDesk:  “We take all the headache away from learning about the blockchain. Hey, you want to move money? Use our API, it’s all over blockchain technology as opposed to correspondent banks. We do it all on the public blockchain, it’s all basically through bitcoin.”  Looking ahead  Today’s launch brings a 10-month private beta to a close, which has seen companies in China using the startup’s service to move funds. Wyre says that it’s also currently working with several companies in Brazil on another private beta, with an eye to expand into that region in the future.  Some of the firms that have already been working with the startup say the concept holds promise, prompting companies like 9fBank to invest.  “We believe Wyre’s cross-border technology will revolutionize global payment and remittance and have since made a sizable investment into the company,” Sam Lin, who serves as CFO for 9fBank, said in a statement.  For now, according to Dunworth, the immediate steps ahead involve expanding the size of its engineering and business development teams.  “A lot of the money is going to be used for scaling our engineering team. Right now we’re at 10, we want to be at 30,” he said.  But just as important, he said, is work on building out the mechanisms by which it moves money between China and the US.  Dunworth told CoinDesk:  “We want to be very focused. When we do it, we want to make sure we’ve got a very solid set of processes from a compliance standpoint and a technical standpoint.”  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Wyre.

42379075,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7muS7,1481815019,Analysts Predict Bitcoin Price Could Reach $800 in 2016's Final Weeks,"After surging more than 75% so far this year, bitcoin prices could finish 2016 even higher, according to a panel of experts polled by CoinDesk.  These market observers pointed to a range of factors when explaining their forecasts, including macroeconomic uncertainty, market dynamics and a currency war ignited by nations attempting to fix their exchange rates.  Strong year for bitcoin  Starting 2016 at roughly $430, the world’s largest and most well-known digital currency has had a great year so far, breaking through $500 in May and then surpassing both $600 and $700 in June, according to the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  On 18th June, bitcoin prices reached $781.31, their highest price thus far in 2016, before falling back from this peak, additional BPI figures reveal. By the end of November, the digital currency was trading slightly north of $740, which represented a 72.5% year-to-date return for the first 11 months.  Bitcoin prices pushed higher during the first few weeks of December, reaching an annual high of $788.49 on the 13th of that month.  The digital currency's price has fluctuated between $700 and $800 since roughly mid-November, and it will likely finish the year in the upper half of this range, according to most analysts reached by CoinDesk.  Petar Zivkovski, director of operations for leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, emphasized bullish market dynamics when explaining his forecast that bitcoin prices would be in the range of ""$750-$780"" by the end of 2016.  “We've seen a healthy dose of new money coming in to support price,” he noted, and stressed that the markets have experienced a “lack of negative/bearish events” that would “trigger an aggressive selloff.”  “Barring an unexpected bearish catalyst,” bitcoin prices will finish the year within the expected range, he told CoinDesk.  Joe Lee, founder of Magnr, gave similar input when elaborating on his prediction that the digital currency would finish the year close to $800.  ""Demand for bitcoin has been consistent throughout H2 2016 with macroeconomic uncertainty driving interest,"" he told CoinDesk, adding:  ""As a non-correlated asset class, bitcoin is proving itself by standing the test of time. As a technology, it is maturing through the technology adoption lifecycle.""  BTCC CEO Bobby Lee also provided an optimistic assessment, telling CoinDesk: ""We like what we've been seeing from a fundamental as well as technical standpoint.""  He also spoke to the lack of volatility the cryptocurrency has enjoyed as of late.  ""Given bitcoin's price stability over the past few months, I think it will likely finish the year under $800."" However, he added that there's a ""small likelihood of an end-of-year price rally"".  Bullish bets  One factor that could increase the odds of such a year-end rally is speculative activity.  Traders have generally been bullish so far this year, and Whaleclub data shows that the market was 73% long during the first 11 months of 2016. 'Confidence', which measures how much larger than average a position’s size was over a particular period, registered 77% over this timeframe.  Ryan Rabaglia, head trader for Octagon Strategies Limited, emphasized this key market factor when making his 2016 year-end forecast.  ""As we've been bullish for quite some time, we’re not going to stop now,"" he told CoinDesk. ""Over the last two months there has been a fair amount of pushing and pulling from both the bulls and the bears, and with our retracement plays working out very well for us in 2016, we see a year close between 790 USD/BTC and 810 USD/BTC.""  'Currency war'  While Rabaglia pointed to market dynamics, Kong Gao, overseas marketing manager for bitcoin trader Richfund, emphasized the efforts nations are making to manipulate their currencies, telling CoinDesk that ""the currency war is now full fledged"".  While China has generated significant visibility for taking action to devalue the yuan relative to other countries, it is certainly not the only nation making an effort to either strengthen or weaken its native currency.  Because of this situation, Gao told CoinDesk ""we predict (65% confidence level) that the [bitcoin] price will rise to about $900.""  Providing an even more optimistic forecast, BitMEX co-founder and CEO Arthur Hayes believes bitcoin could enjoy even greater gains. He suggested that if the digital currency can breach $800, its “next big place of resistance” will be $1,000.  This ""big figure number"" is where bitcoin will finish 2016, predicted Hayes.

42379081,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7muYP,1481806851,2016: The Year That Wasn't For Bitcoin,"Jim Harper is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, working to adapt law and policy to the information age. A former counsel to committees in both the US House and the US Senate, he served as Global Policy Counsel for the Bitcoin Foundation in 2014.  In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review feature, Harper takes aim at bitcoin's so-called ""successes"" in 2016, arguing that fundamentally deficient dialogue is holding back bitcoin and other blockchain-based monies.  It’s been another banner year for bitcoin investors.  The cryptocurrency's price, even in strengthening US dollars, rose more than 75%. Network effects continue to benefit bitcoin – it’s arguably a currency's most important dimension – so there is good reason to think that it will be an engine of wealth for 'hodlers' into the foreseeable future.  But if the bitcoin price is driving ever upward against fiat currencies, what's with all the smoke coming out the tailpipe and steam billowing from under the hood?  2016 has been the year that wasn't for bitcoin – its continued growth in importance, usage and price belie retrenchment. Deficits in social capital that were front and center this year suggest that it could be decades, not years, before bitcoin and cryptocurrency reach their true potential.  It's true, as Ariel Deschapell wrote for CoinDesk this year, that bitcoin is increasingly recognized as a safe-haven asset. Unlinked to any fiat currency or other macroeconomic factor, bitcoin is a good way to diversify a portfolio.  If 5% of the $7tn invested in gold were to migrate to bitcoin, a possibility Barry Silbert of the Digital Currency Group likes to ponder, that implies a bitcoin market cap of $350 billion, or a little under $22,000 per bitcoin.  The gold comparison  What is keeping the world's bitcoins from reaching 1/20th the value of gold?  Well, take a look at the /r/Gold subreddit. Compared to bitcoin's, it's a languid, unpopulated island. The bitcoin subreddits, of course, are warring hives of intense activity and acrimonious debate. There aren't a lot of directly valid data points in the observation, but the suggestion is that wealth accumulates where there is peace.  Disharmony in Bitcoinland reflects the dearth of social capital around the project.  'Social capital', of course, refers to the human institutions that enable physical or technical capital to function effectively, fulfilling its purposes. A widget manufacturing plant has value not only because of what went into its design and construction, but because people know how to run it, they know how to secure it against theft, how to fix it, how to sell the products of it and so on.  Social capital includes knowledge in broader society of how to use widgets, where to buy them, how to preserve them and a sense of their value.  Gold has literally thousands of years of social capital built up around it: Everyone knows what it is. A lot of people own or covet gold themselves. Most people have a sense of how to secure it. There are locations across the globe where gold can be purchased, sold and stored. Everyone has a sense of its lasting value.  They have this sense because gold has been thoroughly tested over centuries to establish the physical properties that make it shiny and rare. A substantial worldwide storehouse of customs and expectations also makes it specially prized.  There are few unknown or controversial dimensions of gold.  Issues with bitcoin  By comparison, bitcoin has almost no social capital.  It's relatively unknown. Of those who know about it, many doubt its viability. They're not wrong to doubt because information suggesting bitcoin’s lasting value is very hard to find. This includes understandings of value itself, open-source software, cryptography, monetary economics and more.  In contrast to gold's shiny, self-advertising color, bitcoin has the scaling debate. It's one of the first things any careful investigator of bitcoin will discover upon pulling back the curtains onto the strange crypto world. The most consequential technical development since the Internet itself has a pronounced way of putting people off.  For all the smarts and dedication seen in the bitcoin community, it is a collective computer nerd with all of a computer nerd's faults – as Urban Dictionary says, ""somebody who knows more than the speaker about computers, who by implication has no social skills"".  Many bitcoiners also have the Millennial’s trait of not knowing how much they don’t know.  A tale of gridlock  At scale, social skills are political skills, and this dimension of social capital is also in short supply.  Consider the capacity of anyone in the bitcoin world to convince just about anyone of anything. The year began with the stalling out of the effort to shift to Bitcoin XT, an alternative to the dominant implementation of bitcoin's code.  Bitcoin Classic came next. It, too, was introduced without sufficient groundwork to attract broad support in a community that is part utterly indifferent and part rigidly partisan. The year ends with Bitcoin Unlimited making its own run at toppling Core and even its preferred improvements appear unlikely to achieve critical mass.  Bitcoin implementations really shouldn't be ""toppled"", of course, for the sake of public confidence. Whatever happens in the debate over the block size limit, the present-day bitcoin community is its own worst enemy.  The social capital that the bitcoin space still needs crosses many domains. If it is going to help deliver on global financial inclusion, financial privacy, liberty and monetary stability for the world's people, bitcoin still needs to be popularized and demystified.  When it comes to the block size limit and similar matters, the ground beneath those debates should be like a Roman road, deeply underlain by scholarly study of the issues in all their dimensions, including the code, of course, but also security and risk management, economics, cryptography, networks, data storage and more.  Ray of light  The forthcoming publication of Ledger, a peer-reviewed scholarly journal focusing in on cryptocurrency and blockchain technology should be widely anticipated. Ledger must establish itself as a universally credible publication.  Leading figures and groups should be voluble communicators, not just on bitcoin forums and social media, but in mainstream and trade media, as well as each on their own, easily found channels. Bitcoin business leaders should act consistently with professional standards at all times. This year made clear that bitcoin needs better communications.  There are social capital efforts underway, of course.  Coin Center continues to calm and educate regulators in the US, whose lead many other countries will follow. The Open Bitcoin Privacy Project is another such effort meant to aid users in protecting their financial privacy. The Bitcoin Foundation was supposed to help develop Bitcoin’s social capital, but the enormity of the task, the diffuse (or lacking) vision of its varying leadership, and some significant early missteps relegated that organization.  Despite the appointment of another well-meaning executive director mid-way through the year, the foundation has been achievement-free in 2016.  Why does this matter? Technology is about people. It only exists with reference to humans and human ends.  The bitcoin ecosystem is not self-actuating or self-correcting. It requires attention and maintenance like any system of human organization. The story of bitcoin in 2016 has been one of retrenchment back from the highs and successes that it could be achieving by now, which go beyond capital gains for tech-savvy investors.  It masks the long way the cryptocurrency ecosystem has to go before it truly delivers on its revolutionary potential.  Have an opinion on blockchain in 2016? A prediction for the year ahead?

42379082,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7muav,1481803222,The Tapscotts on Blockchain in 2016 and What’s Next,"Don Tapscott is the author of 15 books, Chancellor of Trent University in Peterborough, Ontario, and CEO of the Tapscott Group in Toronto. Thinkers 50 ranks him as the No. 4 most important living business thinker.  Alex Tapscott is founder and CEO of Northwest Passage Ventures, an advisory firm in Toronto helping fund and accelerate new companies in the blockchain space. They are the authors of ""Blockchain Revolution: How the Technology Behind Bitcoin is Changing Money, Business and the World"" (Portfolio, 2016).  In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, Don and Alex chart a broad overview of blockchain in 2016, with an eye to what is to come in the year ahead. Notably, they argue that 2016 was the most important year for the tech since the debut of Satoshi Nakamoto's bitcoin white paper.  2016 was a critical year, the most important since Satoshi Nakamoto published “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” in 2008.  When we wrote ""Blockchain Revolution"", many were speculating on what this technology could achieve. We did our best to capture those possibilities – for the economy, government, and society –and have been surprised by the breadth of innovation underway.  For example, central banks have emerged as powerful forces in the future of cryptocurrencies and are gaining momentum. The Bank of England and others are already exploring blockchain-enabled fiat currencies to reduce friction, cost, and risk, increase transparency and accountability, and improve oversight of the financial system.  Healthcare has emerged, in earnest, as one of the most exciting areas. Companies are working to unclog bottlenecks in the system, from clinical trial data to personal health records.  Financial services  2016 was the year that many bank CEOs woke up to both the threat and the opportunity of the blockchain. At a meeting of 50 CEOs of the 50 largest banks back in January, most were skeptical. Now most are investigating how this technology might transform their companies and industry services.  We wrote about the blockchain as the big enabler for reimagining every aspect of the industry – from payments to investment banking, insurance and accounting. Some observers have been surprised to see banks opening to blockchain when they’ve not typically been hotbeds of technology innovation.  What’s driving this growing interest is the blockchain’s once-in-a-generation potential for fixing problems, improving efficiencies and reducing risk – and disintermediating incumbents in the process.  The departure of several large financial institutions from the R3 blockchain consortium is not surprising. We would expect such a large group of institutions to face some collaborative challenges: many of them are competitors, each at different levels of development in different areas of the business.  Consortia will be critical to reinventing financial services and other industries. To effect change, they need well defined goals with tangible objectives. If anything, the shake-up is a sign of a maturing industry.  Investment  When it comes to blockchain investment, the money keeps flowing! 2016 was a major year for investment, with $387m being directed into blockchain startups.  But the nature of these investments has shifted. From 2012 to 2014, primarily venture capitalists were funding business-to-consumer bitcoin-enabled solutions for common banking problems such as cross-border money transfer or retail payments. In 2015 and 2016, we saw money flowing into private blockchain opportunities addressing corporate issues, from asset tracking, to wholesale banking, insurance, accounting, risk management and more.  That investment will continue in 2017, but the pendulum will swing back somewhat to the public blockchain space. If the bitcoin community can get its act together and solve some basic governance issues, investors will again see it as an attractive play – and with good reason. Bitcoin is still the biggest, most secure, most liquid blockchain to date. Ethereum has similar governance issues, which limit its credibility for big corporate investors, but we think ethereum will get through those too.  Solving the prosperity paradox  Prosperity – rather, the lack thereof – was behind the anger that led to the 'Brexit' vote, the Trump election, and extreme populism in countries almost everywhere. The paradox is that there is wealth creation but declining prosperity, the gutting of the middle class and, in the USA, the end of the American dream.  Presidential runner up Hillary Clinton proposed to tax the rich, a plan to redistribute wealth. US President-elect Trump proposed to cut social services, lower taxes for business, restrict trade and resurrect industries like coal mining from the first industrial revolution – a plan to restore prosperity to those who had it in the early 1800s.  In 2015 and 2016, we saw how such blockchain startups like Abra and the not-for-profit Stellar created mobile applications that ended the remittance rip-off, enabled entrepreneurs to pool their resources, and onboarded the unbanked to the global financial system.  Inspired by these social entrepreneurs, we had an idea for a third plan, one that pre-distributed wealth, where the billions of people who currently operate outside the formal economy would own their own data and could begin monetizing it at birth.  In 2017, we expect to see not only applications for establishing individual identity and protecting property rights through immutable records, but platforms for creating a true sharing economy and a government by the people for the people – all on blockchain technology.  To be sure, blockchain innovators face barriers: legacy culture, bureaucracy, regulations and more than a few entrenched and deep-pocketed incumbents unable or unwilling to change. These barriers will slow progress down, but only to a degree. Satoshi has unleashed the genie from the bottle, and no one can stuff her back in.  2017: The year of blockchain stewardship  As noted, there are many impediments to the blockchain and cryptocurrency revolution. None is more important than the immaturity of the ecosystem.  Blockchain technology has emerged globally as the second generation of the Internet. However, its nascent ecosystem lacks the frameworks, language, and processes required for effective stewardship of this critical resource. For example, the bitcoin community has been unable to increase block size, and the ethereum community debated for a long while how to handle the impending removal of tens of millions of dollars from the ethereum distributed autonomous organization (The DAO).  This lack of governance is in stark contrast to the first era, the Internet of Information, which had – and still has – a vast multi-stakeholder network of networks to govern the resource. This bottom-up leadership ensures that states, corporations and state-based institutions like the United Nations cannot control this new global resource.  Instead, the Internet is a self-organizing set of communities.  Several years ago, we studied the Internet governance network and identified 10 types of networks that keep it working. One of the most extraordinary outcomes of the digital revolution, the rise of the global civil society, and the emergence of business as a pillar of society, is that multi-stakeholder networks can help solve global problems and even govern global resources.  We launched the Global Solution Networks (GSNs) Program five years ago to explore this gap in knowledge and to study the definition, differentiation, and impact of these emerging multi-stakeholder networks for solving global problems. These non-government, Internet-enabled collaborations of companies, states, non-government organizations and social stakeholders are using the Web for good, and demonstrating the power of networks to solve problems too intractable for traditional institutions.  GSNs are global experts and network leaders who developed a taxonomy of 10 essential network types and studied the technologies, stakeholders, and governance of hundreds of these networks and the orchestrators driving them. The program documented new models of governance and problem solving that were impacting global challenges including climate change, pandemics, depleted natural resources, violence, and income inequality – problems that transcend national boundaries. We conducted 40 projects overall.    Ten Types of Global Solution Networks    We need an ecosystem like this to steward the blockchain as a resource. Although blockchain technology emerged from the open source community, it quickly attracted many stakeholders, each with different backgrounds, interests and motives. Developers, industry players, venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, governments, NGOs and other civil societies have their own perspectives, and each has a role to play. There are early signs that many of the core stakeholders see the need for leadership and are taking steps to address it.  Until now, industry players have focused largely on building their own companies. Context has become critical.  Many factors can slow, impede and derail this revolution: governments can mess it up; we may fail to come up with sensible standards; we may fail to do the research needed to ensure deep penetration of this technology into various industries; repressive regimes may ban the technology altogether.  In 2017, we need to get our act together. Decentralization is critical to this technology and to the future of civilization. But decentralization does not mean disorganization. So we resolve to focus on governance in the new year. We achieved this for the Internet’s first era. Now is the time to steward the second era effectively. Nothing so powerful as an idea whose time has come (again)!  The year ahead  Notwithstanding our admonitions in ""Blockchain Revolution"" that “the future is not something to be predicted but something to be achieved,” here is what we think will happen in blockchain in 2017:  A major central bank will live test a digital fiat currency and it will work, very well, leading to broader adoption.  Large banks will begin shifting large amounts of over-the-counter (OTC) transactions to real-time settlement on private distributed ledgers. Look for JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Barclays and Santander to lead the charge  Incumbent companies in every industry will begin developing a blockchain strategy, hiring key IT talent and launching pilots – for sure, insurers, healthcare providers, music labels, defense contractors and others. Deloitte and IBM are good examples of this.  Bitcoin will hit $2,000 (that’s right: one bitcoin will be worth $2,000). Ethereum will not collapse, post-DAO, but will become a dominant platform for new apps and new business models. There will be other distributed autonomous enterprises, and they will work as designed.  A new round of startups will enter this space in virtually every industry, particularly a new class of platform and middleware companies. From what we’ve seen, the innovation may well be stunning.  The crisis of legitimacy of democracy (as evidence by the recent US election) will accelerate the development and sandboxing of new e-voting systems and new platforms for accountable democracy emphasizing the use of smart contracts.  Blockchain Revolution will continue to be a global best-seller, in multiple languages, and make the New York Times non-fiction list.  What are we doing in 2017?  We'll close with our resolutions:  In January, we are launching what we hope will be the definitive research study on the impact of blockchain on business. We are staffing up our team with the world’s leading thinkers and tackling seven verticals: financial services, healthcare, retail, manufacturing, telecommunications and media, technology, and government. We are also looking horizontally at the functions of the enterprise, from supply chain management and human resources, to marketing and information technology. Look for more announcements soon.  Also in January, Alex’s company, Northwest Passage Ventures, is launching its first blockchain fund.  We both continue to do our part to move this ecosystem forward.  In 2016, we launched the Muskoka Group with the mission of promoting ecosystem health and empowering the nascent governance ecosystem.  We are currently conducting a project to outline some sensible steps forward. We are inventorying the players, categorizing them according to the GSN Hub (see graphic), and identifying deficiencies in the ecosystem.  In March, we will be releasing our findings and making recommendations to all stakeholders about how to overcome these deficiencies and build an effective ecosystem. Also in March, we will launch an online Blockchain Ecosystem Hub sponsored by some of the most important international organizations. The hub will provide important governance know-how for the Internet’s second era.  In addition, Alex will continue to contribute as a member of the World Economic Forum’s Global Future Council on Blockchain.  And of course, we will both be on the road in 2017 launching into new exciting markets such as Korea, Thailand, Japan and several new European and Latin American countries.
