42381743,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9oy3Z,1554244259,Elon Musk Calls Dogecoin 'My Fav Cryptocurrency',"Elon Musk has diversified his cryptocurrency. Or at least, his crypto-related tweets.  A month and a half after calling bitcoin ""brilliant,"" the Tesla and SpaceX founder lauded one of the crypto market's longest-running, and famously whimsical, alternatives.  ""Dogecoin might be my fav cryptocurrency. It’s pretty cool,"" Musk tweeted Tuesday.  His praise for the meme-inspired asset came in response to an April Fool's Day poll posted the day before by the official Dogecoin account asking who should be the cryptocurrency's next CEO (an absurd notion on its face, since crypto projects are supposed to be decentralized). Musk won with 54 percent of the vote.  So at 18:26 UTC Tuesday, the official Dogecoin account posted, ""Looks like you’re the CEO now @elonmusk, DM us where to email the access codes :-D""  Musk then returned the favor with several tweets mentioning the cryptocurrency including one declaring that ""Dogecoin rulz"" – with a Doge meme attached.  '$4.20 billion'  Then Jackson Palmer, the creator of Dogecoin – currently the 25th most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap – parodied Musk with this tweet:  ""Am considering selling http://Dogecoin.com for $4.20B. Funding (not yet) secured.""  That was a reference to an infamous older post from the Tesla CEO that ultimately led to a Securities and Exchange Commission action.  For those who don't get it: Last summer, Musk tweeted that he had secured funding to sell his electric car company at $420 per share. The statement proved to be untrue, ultimately costing Musk personally his chairmanship of the company and $20 million.  Skeptics who followed Musk's tendency to troll the internet took note of the price: ""420,"" a number that's familiar code to pot users. Hence Palmer's asking price of ""$4.2 billion.""  Palmer, it should be noted, is not involved with this or any cryptocurrency (though he did confirm to CoinDesk that he still owns the website).  But Musk, who also founded the Boring Company, dreamed up the Hyperloop and is a member of the PayPal mafia, seemed proud of his new affiliation.  On Tuesday he changed his Twitter bio to ""CEO of Dogecoin"" (and later updated it again to say he was the ""former CEO."") The most recent tweet from the dubiously appointed executive as of this writing warns investors:  ""Dogecoin value may vary.""

42381738,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9oxw1,1554241505,A Small Bank in Germany Is Now Nearly 30% Owned by Crypto Companies,"Almost 30 percent of the equity in WEG Bank AG, a previously obscure German bank focused on the real estate industry, is now owned by companies in the cryptocurrency industry, CoinDesk has learned.  By purchasing 9.9 percent of the bank, blockchain startup Nimiq now joins TokenPay and the Litecoin Foundation as part owners of the Munich-area financial institution. (Under German law, foreign ownership stakes of 10 percent or greater require additional regulatory approval.)  TokenPay became the first crypto company to acquire the bank’s equity in 2018, with the Litecoin Foundation joining the bank’s stakeholders in a related move. Then WEG Bank partnered with Nimiq to help develop infrastructure for external crypto-to-fiat conversions for banking clients.  Nimiq raised roughly $12.8 million in a token sale in 2017 and, much like TokenPay, has invested its ICO funds in other assets as well, such as real estate and now equity.  Nimiq co-founder Elion Chin said in a statement:  “With Litecoin and Tokenpay as existing shareholders, new clients including [blockchain application platform] Lisk, and other key prospective partnerships, we believe WEG Bank is on the way to reinventing itself as a bank of the future.”  This cross-industry partnership could eventually offer fiat liquidity to decentralized exchange (DEX) users – if they pass the WEG Bank’s screening process.  These days, few DEXs can connect to institutional bank accounts for professional usage, unlike centralized exchange options. Meant to help facilitate the first DEX to WEG Bank AG transaction, the in-progress Nimiq system is scheduled for a limited launch by 2020. That said, WEG Bank AG will remain a traditional bank, never directly touching cryptocurrency.  ""For the past 12 months, we have been looking at various ways to expand our core banking activities into the blockchain community,” WEG Bank AG CEO Matthias von Hauff said in a press statement about the effort in February. “With Nimiq, we have been able to develop not only a landmark payment interface which has the potential to revolutionize the way we deal with cryptocurrencies, but also an innovative and powerful partnership.""  For its part, Nimiq announced in a blog post that it would work with DEXs like Agora Trade to act as a “middleman to transfer funds between crypto markets and the traditional banking system,” charging a small percentage of transaction fees along the way. In return, the blog post says, Agora Trade will list Nimiq’s NIM tokens for cross-chain trades with ether and bitcoin without any exchange fees for NIM users.  Nimiq is also partnering with Binance-owned Trust Wallet, according to a recent blog post. The aim is to eventually give users across DEXs access to liquid euros for transactions made with bitcoin, ether or NIM through Nimiq’s upcoming “crypto-to-fiat bridge” called OASIS.  Correction (April 3, 19:00 UTC): Though the Litecoin Foundation is a WEG Bank AG shareholder, Litecoin Foundation Managing Director Charlie Lee is not on the board of the bank, as was previously reported.

The company's founders – Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz – told Forbes that the firm had applied to become a registered investment advisor, so as to allow it to place larger bets and invest more heavily into high-risk asset classes, such as cryptocurrencies.  As such, a16z is shifting away from being a traditional venture capital firm.  According to Forbes, the company can now put as much as $1 billion in these riskier bets, such as cryptocurrency or other digital assets. The firm can also ""buy unlimited shares in public companies or from other investors,"" under current U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules.  As a VC firm, Andreessen Horowitz would not be able to invest as heavily in these riskier assets due to regulations. Specifically, under SEC rules, no more than 20 percent of a VC fund could be invested in ""high-risk"" assets. This included secondary share purchases, Forbes reported.  The shift was completed in March, and required the firm to hire some new compliance officers, as well as audit each of its employees.  However, general partner Katie Haun (who co-leads its crypto-specific fund) told Forbes that the shift also brings a number of benefits, including the fact that partners in the firm can collaborate on deals.  This allows them to pool expertise, according to the report.  The firm has already invested heavily within the crypto space. To date, it has backed crypto exchange Coinbase, stablecoin developer TrustToken, cloud computing platform Oasis Labs and other startups. More recently, it launched its own crypto-specific wing with more than $300 million.  Reached by CoinDesk Tuesday, a spokesperson for Andreessen Horowitz declined to comment.

42381734,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9oxtV,1554235161,$255 Million: Coinbase Confirms Extent of Crypto Insurance Coverage,"Coinbase has revealed the details of its insurance arrangements for cryptocurrency held on customers' behalf, a rare move in an opaque market.  In a blog post published Tuesday, Philip Martin the exchange’s vice president of security, confirmed that it is covered for up to $255 million for coins held in so-called hot wallets – in other words, assets which are essentially online and open to potential hacks. CoinDesk first reported in November that Coinbase's coverage was in this ballpark.  San Francisco-based Coinbase holds less than 2 percent of customers' assets in hot wallets, with the remaining 98 percent at arm's length from third-party attacks in cold storage, where the private keys are offline, the company told CoinDesk. (At its height during the crypto bull market, the company stored $25 billion worth of assets on customers’ behalf, but the company would not provide a recent figure.)  This policy was placed by Lloyd’s registered broker Aon and sourced from a global group of US and UK insurance companies, including certain Lloyd’s of London syndicates, Martin's blog post said. He did not name the individual underwriters.  Lloyd’s, which gathers under one roof a range of specialist insurance markets dealing with everything from crime and cyber attacks to natural disasters, is viewed as a seal of approval when it comes to underwriting potential losses of crypto assets.  Previously secretive about publicizing anything about insurance of digital assets, Lloyd’s is steadily becoming more visible, for a certain class of crypto customer at least.  For instance, last month security specialists BitGo trumpeted $100 million of cover for crypto held in cold storage and went as far as naming the lead Lloyd’s underwriter of the policy.  In fact, much of Martin's post could be read as a veiled dig at BitGo, since he talks about ""recent news and announcements"" around crypto insurance, suggesting a lot of ""confusion"" still exists. He then advises firms to focus on hot wallet cover as opposed to cold storage, where value is ""at rest"" and therefore not so much at risk.  Regarding Coinbase’s blog post, Clarissa Horowitz, VP marketing, BitGo, told CoinDesk via email:  “We're glad to see that Coinbase is following our lead in bringing more transparency to the discussion of insurance for digital assets. Insurance is complex and transparency is essential for building trust.”  Crime vs. specie  As well as being more transparent about Coinbase’s insurance cover, Martin took the opportunity to blog about some of the things the vex him about the nascent market for crypto insurance.  For a start, by far the most likely consumer loss scenario for any cryptocurrency company is hot wallet loss due to hacking, he wrote. Because of this fact, coverage for hot wallet exposures is significantly more expensive than the cover for cold storage alone, noted Martin.  Moreover, hot wallet cover is provided specifically by the crime insurance market, which is different and separate from the cold storage variety, which is covered by the specie insurance marketplace.  Crime policies cover what he calls ""value in transit,"" which traditionally has included theft of things like cash in ATMs and armored cars. In crypto, this type of insurance would cover losses due to hacking, insider theft, and fraudulent transfer. Included in this are fiat currency and hot wallet cover in addition to the physical damage or theft of private key data in cold storage.  The specie market, on the other hand, generally insures ""value at rest,"" such as fine art, precious metals and the like when in a vault or on display. For digital assets, then, specie policies available in the market today focus exclusively on physical damage or loss of private keys (including employee misuse or theft) in cold storage.  Insuring the former risk is more important, Martin argued:  “Companies should focus on insurance for value in flight. This means that exchanges and wallets should have sufficient crime coverage to fully cover their hot wallets (including enough buffer to handle asset price spikes).”  As such, custodians should have enough crime insurance to cover normal outbound customer transaction sizes or enough to cover whatever assets are programmatically accessible if they’re not using cold storage, he said.  The blog also pointed out that specie policies do not generally cover hacking in the traditional sense of the word, nor would they likely cover any kind of blockchain-specific failure. For example, such a policy would not cover a loss of funds that occurred due to an on-blockchain failure, such as a vulnerable smart contract multi-signature implementation.  “The best use of specie policies is as a hedge against major natural or regional disasters, or insider theft/destruction of private key material,” Martin added.  Short on capacity  Looking ahead, Martin pointed to the disconnect given that policies are denominated in fiat but the assets are in crypto. This means that in bull markets it can be challenging for companies looking to grow insurance policy limits at the same pace as asset prices are moving.  The solution, he said, would be insurers holding digital assets in order to offer policy limits denominated in cryptocurrency to avoid differences in valuation.  In addition, policies are generally written to exchanges or custodians, not directly to the owners of cryptocurrency.  “We need a world where the ultimate owners of cryptocurrency are able to directly insure their assets stored with trustworthy, well-reviewed, transparent service providers,” wrote Martin.  Despite improvements in understanding on behalf of insurers and brokers, there is still not enough capacity in the market, Coinbase asserted. (In the case of some larger crypto exchanges, this lack has been plugged by simply setting aside thousands of bitcoin in case of a hack.)  The demand for cryptocurrency insurance has increased faster than new entrants coming in, noted Martin, concluding:  “We need more participants in this market.”  Pic: Coinbase company offices, courtesy of Coinbase",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/04/02/255-million-coinbase-confirms-extent-of-crypto-insurance-coverage,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/04df61588d1a8d7e5ec52785f952dbc2921720ed-1500x999.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42381737,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9oxsF,1554222113,QuadrigaCX Crypto Exchange Could Soon Be Placed in Bankruptcy,"Ernst and Young (EY), the court-appointed monitor for collapsed Canadian crypto exchange QuadrigaCX, has proposed transitioning the company from a restructuring process to bankruptcy proceedings.  In a new report posted Tuesday, EY said that the exchange's creditors ""will benefit"" from converting its current restructuring process under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) to a new one under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (BIA).  ""Transitioning from the CCAA to the BIA will streamline the administration of the proceedings, reduce the level of professional involvement and provide enhanced investigative powers for the Trustee,"" the company said, adding:  ""As set out in previous reports of the Monitor, the current objective of these CCAA proceedings is data and asset recovery. Given the present circumstances, the possibility that Quadriga will restructure and emerge from CCAA protection appears remote.""  EY's work to recover Quadriga's missing or frozen $190 million in crypto can still occur under the BIA. The exchange first reported at the end of January that it was unable to locate some $136 million in crypto and needed assistance pulling another $53 million from third-party payment processors.  There are a number of benefits to moving for bankruptcy, EY said, including allowing Quadriga to sell any valuable assets, reducing governance issues by removing the need for a chief restructuring officer or directors, allowing representative counsel to continue to participate and giving the exchange's trustee ""additional investigatory powers"" without requiring court orders.  Bankruptcy is also likely to be cost-effective, EY says, though it explained that one of the cost reductions would come from no longer having to update the court on the exchange's efforts to recover funds.  ""It would remain available to the Trustee to provide reports to Affected Users during the bankruptcy,"" the report says.  Wrapping up  In its report, EY indicated that its research into Quadriga's missing funds might be nearing an end. It plans to file a final report in the next few weeks, which would update the court on what progress it has made, though Tuesday's filing did not provide any clarity on the exchange's missing cryptos.  In a previous report, EY said that the cold wallets Quadriga used to store bitcoin were empty (aside from some bitcoin accidentally transferred to one set of addresses), and that the exchange was unsure where the missing bitcoin could be.  Tuesday's report did discuss a number of third-party payment processors holding fiat currencies on Quadriga's behalf. Some, including VoPay, have confirmed that they are holding funds but may require court orders to return them.  Others, like WebBank 21, which recently rebranded to Black Banx, have not responded to EY, according to the report. Black Banx is holding roughly $9 million CAD ($6.7 million USD) that belongs to Quadriga.  Perhaps more notably, one payment processor which conducted business with Quadriga is operated by Jennifer Robertson, the widow of Quadriga founder Gerald Cotten. However, the firm, Robertson Nova Consulting Inc., claims to not be holding any funds on the exchange's behalf.  ""Counsel for Ms. Robertson also indicated that Ms. Robertson would work to obtain final statements from the financial institutions that held accounts for RNCI and would provide them to the Monitor once available,"" EY said.  Asset preservation  The report also added that it was filing an Asset Preservation Order, ""which involves all assets held by the Cotten Estate, Ms. Roberston, the Seaglass Trust, Robertson Nova Consulting Inc., and Robertson Nova Property Management Inc. due to concerns that corporate and personal boundaries between Quadriga and Cotten were not maintained.  ""Quadriga funds may have been used to acquire assets held outside the corporate entity,"" EY wrote.  If approved, the order would prevent Robertson or any of the companies named from selling or otherwise conducting any business with assets, EY wrote.  Prior to discussions with Robertson and her counsel, EY had been filing for a mareva injunction, which would have frozen her assets pursuant to a court order regardless. Using the asset preservation order instead allows EY to continue to investigate Quadriga, and sell any assets that are recoverable for the exchange's creditors.

42381754,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9oy9r,1554221906,Bitcoin's Price Rises Above Major Moving Averages In First Since 2018,"Bitcoin’s price emerged above three major moving averages for the first time in nearly 15 months on Tuesday.  The development is a byproduct of the cryptocurrency’s surge above $5,000 during Tuesday's trading session, representing an increase in excess of 20 percent.  A moving average (MA), when used in financial analysis, is simply a continuously calculated average of a certain economic factor like price or trading volume over a specified period of time. The moving average is particularly useful for smoothing out short-term fluctuations in the data set to identify the direction of the longer term trend.  Certain moving average durations like the 50, 100 and 200 day MA's are of more importance when analyzing the price of a traded asset because they tend to display if recent price action is out or under performing its recent or distant trends, which can highlight bullish or bearish market conditions. Perhaps most significant is the 200 day MA, which is commonly regarded as the dividing line between a strong market and weak one.  Notably, bitcoin’s price is now trading above these three key moving averages in first since January 13, 2018.  BTC/USD daily chart  As can be seen in the chart above, bitcoin at the time was priced closer to $15,000 before falling below the 50 day moving average, according to Bitstamp figures. Contrary to what occurred today, this was a bearish signal that pointed to a degree of loss to the strength of the short term trend.  Not long after falling below the 50 day MA, bitcoin's price found acceptance below the remaining two moving averages, solidifying the newfound bearish trend.  Recently, however, the opposite appears to be the case.  Bitcoin’s price began trading above both the 50 and 100 day moving averages on Feb. 18 of this year, suggesting its trend was beginning to pick up strength. Roughly three weeks later 50 day MA crossed above the 100 day MA, which is an example of a moving average trading strategy called the bullish crossover that is generally considered a buy signal.  Last but not least, bitcoin’s price was able to trade above the 200 day moving average today for the first time since it fell below the MA on March 14, 2018.  BTC/USD moving averages in 2015-2018  Looking back at bitcoin’s historical price data, the 200 day moving average indeed appears to be an important obstacle to gain acceptance above.  As can be seen, bitcoin's price rose 7,500 percent after finding acceptance above it as well as the 50 and 100 day MAs on October 15, 2015. Notably, its price remained above the 200 day MA for the entire uptrend, until after the market had topped in early 2018.  It’s important to note major moving averages are also touted for offering price support and resistance, so the 200 day MA is likely to be a stubborn technical hurdle until bitcoin's price can close on a UTC basis above it.

In light of the proposed digitization efforts, Pakistan’s finance minister Asad Umar asked the central bank and the country's Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) to ensure cybersecurity in the banking system, the report adds, as a failure here could cause damage to confidence in the system and the economy.  Just yesterday, the SBP also published new regulations for Electronic Money Institutions (EMIs), a classification that covers cryptocurrency firms. As per the new rules, EMIs must meet certain requirements to be licensed by the country’s government, with firms flouting the rules to face suspension or cancellation of licenses.  The officials made their comments at a ceremony to mark the launch of the new regulations on Monday.  With the regulations in place, the central bank said in a statement that it expects upcoming EMIs to offer “convenient, cost effective, interoperable and secure digital payment products and services to end users.”  The finance minister said in the Tuesday's report:  “It is our government’s policy to encourage the use of e-commerce amongst [the] public through awareness campaigns to promote a culture of e-commerce, which supports electronic business transactions at national, regional and international levels.”  State Bank of Pakistan image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Yogita Khatri,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/04/02/pakistan-central-bank-eyes-digital-currency-launch-by-2025,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/575764ccf3a21c2b91ed23f1cf15682be4707db6-1500x1109.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42381732,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9oxpj,1554210007,PayPal Makes Its First-Ever Investment in a Blockchain Startup,"Online payments giant PayPal has made its first-ever investment in a blockchain technology company.  Announced today, PayPal has joined the extension of a Series A funding round in Cambridge Blockchain, a startup that helps financial institutions and other companies manage sensitive data using shared ledgers.  Neither PayPal nor Cambridge Blockchain disclosed the investment amount, but recent filings with the SEC indicate that Cambridge Blockchain has raised a total of $3.5 million in new equity from several investors over the past nine months. That follows the $7 million close of its Series A in May of 2018, and brings the total capital raised to $10.5 million.  That first $7 million consisted of $4 million of new capital plus $3 million of converted notes, and came from several investors, including HCM Capital, the VC arm of Foxconn, which manufactures the iPhone for Apple, as well as Digital Currency Group.  The subsequent $3.5 million came from PayPal as well as Omidyar Network, the philanthropic investment firm started by the founder of eBay (PayPal's former parent); Flourish, Omidyar's financial inclusion investment spinoff; and Future/Perfect Ventures.  In this way, PayPal's investment was modest but symbolically important.  Regarding its part in the funding, a PayPal spokesperson told CoinDesk via email:  “We made an investment in Cambridge Blockchain because it is applying blockchain for digital identity in a way that we believe could benefit financial services companies including PayPal. Our investment will allow us to explore potential collaborations to leverage blockchain technology.”  She confirmed that Cambridge is PayPal’s first investment in a blockchain company.  A match made in Luxembourg  Cambridge Blockchain CEO Matthew Commons said PayPal has been involved one way or another with his Massachussets-based identity startup for the past year or so. For instance, Cambridge was one of a small cohort of startups in the “Fintech Europe 2018” accelerator program, which was sponsored by PayPal.  Serendipitously, Cambridge Blockchain has been working with LuxTrust, which is backed by the government of Luxembourg and financial institutions in the region. PayPal had moved its European headquarters to Luxembourg and was granted a banking license there. So, there was a natural affinity there, Commons told CoinDesk, adding:  “We can't talk specifically about anything commercially that we are doing because it's all sort of exploratory now, but I think the fact that we are deployed in Luxembourg and they [PayPal] have a major presence there also helped to get things moving.”  Indeed, toward the end of 2018, Cambridge started working directly with PayPal’s corporate venture group out of San Jose which ultimately led to the investment, said Commons.  Stepping back, Massachusetts-based Cambridge Blockchain stores, shares and validates data using blockchains, and in this capacity, it can run on top of any flavor of distributed ledger, public or private. The startup now has 15 employees spread across offices in the U.S., Paris and a recently established base in Beijing.  Cambridge Blockchain’s bread and butter is around the onboarding of personal data and know-your-customer (KYC) vetting necessary to open accounts with banks and other financial services providers, although it has also been working with commercially sensitive supply chain data with Foxconn. The startup is part of the Decentralized Identity Foundation which counts the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, R3, IBM Blockchain, and Hyperledger among its members.  The firm has gained hands-on experience with tough European strictures such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and PSD2, the second European payments directive. By allowing compliant but efficient sharing of personal data, Cambridge claims it can help reduce the massive duplication of KYC-ing that goes on today.  This is an obvious use case for PayPal which has hundreds of millions of accounts around the world as well as other platforms like Venmo, Hyperwallet and Swift Financial.  Commons said that PayPal had certainly kicked the tires of many blockchain-based identity vendors out there and he was “honored” to have been selected for the investment and to go on to explore personal data use cases with the payments firm, concluding:  “If you are looking to help get some traction for a distributed identity system, it's great to have a partner like that.”  PayPal image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/04/02/paypal-makes-its-first-ever-investment-in-a-blockchain-startup,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1bda332fe9e76df4b9b7f68679672c636df3db82-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42381744,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9oy65,1554208254,"Apple, Amazon Alums Behind Sharding Startup Raise $18 Million","Bucking the 2019 trend of fundraising on equity, one startup has completed a substantial token presale.  Harmony  announced Tuesday that it raised $18 million from an array of investors that includes Hong Kong's Lemniscap VC, Australia's BCA Fund, Singapore's UniValues Associates and Silicon Valley's Consensus Capital, among others.  Co-founder Nick White told CoinDesk that selling tokens was the only path that made sense, because ""our long-term vision is to create a decentralized protocol.""  The Harmony blockchain will launch with a pre-mine of 12.6 billion tokens. Investors have purchased slightly more than 2.8 billion of these tokens in this sale. The startup is considering ways of using some of the remaining pre-mined tokens to incentivize early adopters of the network, including distributions to those who participate as nodes.  Upon launch, proof-of-stake nodes on the network will be compensated with an as-yet-undetermined rate of inflation, which should gradually decrease over time (like bitcoin), though there is no pre-determined maximum supply (unlike bitcoin).  White said that the large number of investors spread around the world should help the blockchain to win adoption. Additionally, many of these investors have backed existing decentralized applications (dapps). ""That's where it becomes more interesting,"" White said.  Chain swapping  The Harmony chain is purpose-built to make porting dapps over from ethereum, in particular, quite easy.  So if a dapp has traction but is running into friction with confirmation times or gas fees on ethereum, teams might find they can give users a superior experience by running their dapps on Harmony.  By having investors who have backed these dapps, Harmony believes it can help persuade companies to port their operations to the new chain.  ""Harmony's core architecture and approach are the right ones to scale blockchain protocol (state sharding and peer to peer networking),"" Maximilian Thyssen, an angel investor who joined the Harmony round, told CoinDesk in an email. ""Innovation in centralized systems is slowed down and bottlenecked by massive incumbents like Google/Facebook.""  The goal is much larger than that, though, according to Harmony.  The company wants to get all personal data moved onto a decentralized protocol so that people can start earning money from the data they generate, as a sort of universal basic income. Though White acknowledged that vision is a long way – probably decades – off.  ""When we start to attract a meaningful number of users, you kind of create a new data economy,"" White said. ""And that, in the end, is what enables data as an income.""  The team includes alums from Web 2.0 giants like Google and Amazon, companies that have made great advantage of people's data on the internet. For example, Harmony's founder and CEO Stephen Tse has spent time at Apple, Microsoft and Google – so the implications of this information-democratizing vision are not lost on Harmony's founders.  White said:  ""The companies our team came from, they monopolize all this, and they extract a lot of the value that maybe users should be getting.""  Finding community  Obviously, to create universal basic income from data, Harmony needs to get everyone on its blockchain. Adoption is always the heaviest lift.  To that end, the company plans to get every dapp with traction on ethereum onto Harmony almost as soon as the chain launches, White said.  The protocol is built to be compatible with the ethereum virtual machine, and because those smart contracts are open source, White says Harmony is able to make porting ""practically frictionless.""  ""We could take MakerDAO and copy it and play around with it,"" White said, for example.  This also means Harmony can copy over the developer tools that have been made for ethereum.  Another traditional approach to scaling crypto adoption has been getting tokens into the hands of regular people – typically in the form of an initial coin offering (ICO).  ""We've actually been kind of stymied about the regulations around doing public sales,"" White said. ""Being a U.S. company, we are trying to be very compliant.""  That said, the company is considering an initial exchange offering (IEO), where a token first appears on an exchange and is sold to supporters there. Harmony is currently in talks with multiple major exchanges about the terms for such a deal.  Deep sharding  Harmony touts incorporating many well-established technologies proven at major tech companies, but the central insight of the protocol is what the company calls ""deep sharding.""  Sharding is familiar to followers of proof-of-stake technology, most notably as an eventual path to ethereum scaling. However, Harmony puts every kind of calculation onto different shards, which is why it calls it ""deep sharding."" It creates shards for everything a blockchain does.  ""It's about doing all the things you need to do in a blockchain,"" White said, rattling off examples like verifying, routing, communicating and storing, ""and parallelizing each of that into subnetworks.""  By optimizing for bandwidth, he said, Harmony is able to increase its throughput in a way that other blockchains have neglected. Another startup, BloXroute Labs, has made a similar argument.  Speaking to Harmony's long-term vision, White said:  ""We are building a scalable, high-throughput, low-cost, fast-finality blockchain.""

Revealing the news exclusively to CoinDesk on Tuesday, the firm said its new TrueGBP token is now available for trading on over-the-counter (OTC) desks, including Alameda Research, Bluefire Capital, Galois Capital and QCP Capital. The firm is working to make it available for general trading on cryptocurrency exchanges soon.  TrueGBP will trade under the ticker symbol TGBP and will initially be backed by GBP funds held in U.S. escrow accounts, TrustToken said.  Rafael Cosman, the startup's co-founder and head of engineering and product, told CoinDesk:  “Purchase and trade of TrueGBP will be available like any other ERC-20 token, and is compatible with all ERC-20 wallets. Customers who want to purchase or redeem through the TrustToken app will need to pass the regular KYC [Know Your Customer]/AML [Anti Money Laundering] requirements in accordance with our MSB [Money Service Business] license.”  TrustToken already offers a dollar-pegged stablecoin called TrueUSD, a product launched in March 2018. At the time, the firm said it plans to launch stablecoins linked to the yen, euro and other fiat currencies in the future.  Reiterating the point, TrustToken indicated Tuesday that TrueGBP is the ""first of several"" stablecoins planned for launch “in the coming months to open up new opportunities for payments, international remittances and foreign exchange.”  Cosman said in the statement:  “With TrueUSD, we have built the bridge between the fiat and crypto world, without being tied to any one exchange. Our goal in launching TrueGBP is to fully utilize this bridge to reduce the friction within global financial markets, to seamlessly increase the speed and decrease the cost of transferring value across global borders.”  The TrueGBP token is based on the same technical and legal standards as its dollar-pegged sibling, he added.  TrueCoin, LLC, the entity first created by TrustToken to oversee TrueUSD, is a registered MSB with the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). It has now partnered with “independent state-licensed trust companies to manage the British Pounds backing TrueGBP,” according to the statement.

42381748,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9oyB7,1554201653,Sudden Bitcoin Price Breakout Sets New Bull Target at Over $5K,"View  With bitcoin's move today to 4.5-month highs near $5,080, the transition from bear to bull market appears done and dusted.  The trend change would gain credence, though, if and when BTC finds acceptance above the former support-turned-resistance of the 21-month exponential moving average (EMA), currently at $5,200.  The cryptocurrency is looking overbought as per the 14-day relative strength index, so prices may have a tough time breaking above $5,200 in the near-term.  Bitcoin could see a pullback to $4,400 if signs of bullish exhaustion increase in the next few days.  After today's breakout, bitcoin (BTC) now needs to move above crucial resistance near $5,200 to solidify the case for a longer-term bull market.  The world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization crossed the last bearish lower high of $4,236 (Dec. 24 high) at 04:30 UTC Tuesday and jumped to $5,080 – the highest level since Nov. 19 – confirming a transition from a bear to a bull market.  The rally to a 4.5-month high was accompanied by a surge in 24-hour trading volumes to above $15 billion – the highest since mid-January 2018, according to CoinMarketCap. The bullish reversal, therefore, looks sustainable.  Further, the spike witnessed today has reinforced the positive trend change signaled by both the weekly moving average convergence divergence (MACD) and the money flow index a few weeks ago.  While the path of least resistance is now to the higher side, the bulls now face taking out the former support-turned-resistance of the 21-month exponential moving average (EMA), currently lined up at $5,200.  The persistent defense of that average support in the five months to October 2018 had triggered hopes of a strong bullish move. More importantly, a convincing break below that technical line on Nov. 14 invited strong selling pressure.  So the bulls need to force a convincing break above the 21-month EMA before claiming a complete victory over the bears.  As of writing, bitcoin is changing hands at $4,800 on Bitstamp, representing a 15 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  Other major cryptocurrencies like ethereum's ETH token, XRP and EOS are up at least 5 percent each. Meanwhile, names like litecoin, cardano and monero are flashing double-digit gains.  Weekly chart  The 5- and 10-week moving averages (MAs) are also trending north, indicating a bullish setup, while the relative strength index (RSI) is probing the former support-turned-resistance of 53.70. A break higher would further strengthen the bullish case.  Monthly chart  BTC came close to testing the 21-month MA, currently at $5,200, earlier today. A monthly close above that average would solidify the bullish reversal and encourage further buying, possibly leading to a move above $6,000.  A break above the 21-month EMA, however, may remain elusive for a few weeks, as the cryptocurrency is looking overbought on shorter duration charts.  Daily chart  On the daily chart, the 14-day RSI is at 86.00 – the highest level since December 2017.  The overbought reading would gain credence if the cryptocurrency creates bullish exhaustion patterns (e.g. doji, bearish engulfing, or inverted bearish hammer candles) in the next few days.  In that case, prices could fall back to $4,400 (Nov. 29 high) and consolidate for a period.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42381740,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9oxyX,1554195634,A New Bank for Crypto Traders Has Opened in Puerto Rico,"San Juan Mercantile Bank & Trust International (SJMBT), a new Puerto Rico-based institution catering to traders of cryptocurrency, has opened for business.  Announced Monday, SJMBT has accepted its first client deposit. Licensed last month as an international financial entity (IFE) by Puerto Rico's Office of the Commission of Financial Institutions (OCIF), the bank is a unit of Mercantile Global Holdings (MGH), which also owns San Juan Mercantile Exchange (SJMX), a soon-to-be-launched ""institutional-grade electronic trading platform for digital assets.""  The bank will provide custody and settlement services for both fiat and crypto traded on the exchange. SJMBT itself is not insured by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), but a spokesperson told CoinDesk it will place clients' deposits at correspondent banks.  Similarly, customers' digital assets will be held at ""approved digital asset custodians,"" the company said. The spokesperson would not name any of the bank's correspondents or custodians, nor its initial clients.  Keeping custody and trading under the same roof will bring certain benefits, MGH said. For example, the exchange will take into account customer balances on deposit at the bank when setting trading limits, enabling the bank to settle trades in real time.  “As more liquidity venues onboard with SJMX to trade digital assets, SJMBT will provide critical services, such as real-time settlement and account re-balancing, in support of our customers’ trading activities,” said Nick Varelakis, president and chief operating officer of SJMB&T.  Finance veterans  MGH's leadership includes veterans of well-known financial companies.  Varelakis, for example, is a former executive director of JPMorgan Chase for business architecture and transformation, as well as a former chief operating officer of Puerto Rico's Noble Bank, best known in the crypto space for its erstwhile relationshiphttps://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2018-12-18/crypto-mystery-clues-suggest-tether-has-the-billions-it-promised with Tether, the company behind the namesake stablecoin.  Moreover, the MGH bank and exchange were founded a year ago by J. Robert Collins Jr., former president of the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX, a part of CME Group) and a founder of the Dubai Mercantile Exchange.  Trading will launch imminently, the company indicated. ""With the new customers onboarded at [the bank], [the exchange] is able to launch exchange operations, via the SJMX Dark Pool platform and through SJMX Blocks, its over-the-counter (OTC) trading venue,"" MGH's press release says.  Banking remains hard to come by for cryptocurrency market participants, with only a handful of institutions willing to serve the sector due to money laundering concerns and other perceived risks.

As long as any cryptocurrency has “sufficient liquidity, good development records, and no nefarious activity,” the firm would continue adding ETP products, Rashwan indicated, adding:  “We plan on launching other strategies, more single asset ETPs, and more indices! We are planning on having 6–8 additional launches this year.”  All four ETP products are built and issued by Amun AG’s own platform – the Amun Onyx. The platform also operates the products once they go live on the SIX exchange, according to the statement.

42430358,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMriZh,1554177641,"Exchange Volumes May Be Fake, But Bitcoin's Value Is Real","Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      The mainstream reaction to Bitwise’s recent report showing that 95 percent of total reported bitcoin trading is fake was, predictably, to see it as further proof of the lawlessness and scammy nature of the cryptocurrency world.  But just as important as that statistic were the ones that the asset manager used to describe trading activity on the 10 “real exchanges” hosting the 5 percent that is not made up of wash trades and other manipulations.  Within its presentation seeking approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission for a bitcoin-based exchange-traded fund (ETF), Bitwise included one slide with a screenshot from Coinbase Pro showing a mere 0.0003 percent bid/offer price spread and stated that it had to be “among the tightest quoted spread of any financial instrument in the world.”  This supports one the key arguments in favor of cryptocurrencies: that by cutting out the many financial intermediaries needed to execute trades in the traditional financial system, this technology achieves impressive efficiency and cost reduction for market participants.  More than merely a critique of the price manipulation rife across bitcoin markets, then, the Bitwise report is a demonstration of cryptocurrencies’ great potential.  Ironically, it also convincingly makes the point that to achieve that potential, there needs to be greater regulation of crypto trading.  Thin liquidity, yet high efficiency  The thin price spreads are especially remarkable when you consider that authentic bitcoin trading represents a drop in the ocean compared with those traditional markets where price spreads tend to be tight.  For example, daily turnover in the U.S. Treasurys market, considered one of the most price-efficient markets in the world, tends to range between $550 billion and $1 trillion, whereas Bitwise estimates worldwide daily authentic bitcoin trading to be just $273 million. Consider also that bitcoin exchanges are typically open to retail investors, whereas Treasurys are almost entirely traded by institutional investors moving very large amounts of money.  In traditional markets, size dictates liquidity, which in turn determines price efficiency. But this data shows that bitcoin is capable of highly efficient outcomes at a much lower scale.  All of those efficiency gains occur because bitcoin eliminates the fee-charging trusted intermediaries that carry out a variety of back-office execution and settlement processes within the legacy financial system. But here's the catch: the Bitwise report shows that in order to enjoy those payoffs, traders must rely on trustworthy entities to carry out the front-end function of finding buyers and sellers.  Further, it would appear from Bitwise’s list of 10 real exchanges that, at least for now, those that willingly put themselves under the scrutiny of regulators are the ones earning that trust.  All those annoyingly cumbersome and costly know-your-customer procedures might actually be worth it. They provide the regulatory framework within which bitcoin’s other, back-office magic can safely occur.  It’s perhaps tempting to argue that this regulated exchange advantage will disappear when new decentralized solutions such as the model developed by Arwen allow traders to retain full custody of their coins and exchanges are left to perform solely the price-matching function. But while that will help protect investors from abuses that lead to losses such as the evaporation of $190 million at QuadrigaCX, it doesn’t solve for the core function that exchanges provide: price discovery.  For now, and perhaps forever, there’s no getting around the network effect advantages that centralized platforms like Coinbase Pro bring to the price discovery process. But if the exchange isn’t compelled by a regulator to refrain from manipulating prices, investors can’t be assured that it isn’t trading against it. In those cases, price discovery is an illusion.  Regulated price discovery  In this context, it’s noteworthy that the key selling point that the Intercontinental Exchange uses to promote its yet-to-be-launched bitcoin trading platform, Bakkt, is that it will give financial institutions the peace of mind of “federally regulated price discovery.” Only with the full backstop of federal oversight, Bakkt says, can large institutions be assured of reliable prices and thus maintain the fiduciary duty they owe their customers.  Coinbase and other exchanges that are competing with Bakkt for the potentially very large institutional market will, of course, disagree with this assessment. They’ll argue that their regulatory framework, founded on state-by-state money transmission licensing rules, will sufficiently protect investors. Perhaps Bitwise’s report will help them make that argument.  In any case, far from representing another damaging blow to bitcoin’s reputation in the public eye, Bitwise’s damning report on scammy exchanges should be viewed as a big boost to bitcoin’s bid for legitimacy in the wider world.  It shows those who are skeptical that there are real public-interest benefits to be gained from this technology while demonstrating to bitcoin’s true believers that it’s to their advantage to submit to some degree of regulatory oversight.
