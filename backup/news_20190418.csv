42430410,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMsWbh,1555624807,Overstock's tZERO Token Market Misses Closing Date for $100 Million Raise,"Overstock’s tZERO security token trading platform has once again failed to close on a capital injection by the targeted date.  In a letter to shareholders Thursday, Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne said the $100 million investment led by Makara Capital and GSR Capital that was agreed upon in February and scheduled for completion in mid-April had not closed.  “Makara’s due diligence has progressed, and in the course of its due diligence Makara has proven to be a professional and serious fund. Still, the parties will not have a definitive deal in place by the mid-April target,” Byrne wrote.  “tZERO plans to continue facilitating Makara’s diligence, but is not under any exclusivity with Makara or GSR and has retained advisors to pursue parallel alternatives,” he added.  Byrne added that GSR is still is obliged to buy $30 million worth of tZERO tokens under a binding agreement it signed last year, and the purchase must be completed May 6, three days before Overstock’s next scheduled shareholder meeting.  This was the second time a tZERO deal with investors fell through, after GSR backed off its intention to invest $404 million in Overstock and tZERO earlier this year.  Focus on execution  The saga of Overstock’s negotiations with the two Asian funds started last summer.  In August the company announced GSR would buy $270 million worth of tZERO equity (valuing the operation at $1.5 billion), $30 million of tZERO tokens from Overstock.com and up to $104.55 million in shares of Overstock.com. The deal was scheduled to close in December, but shortly before the deadline GSR asked for an extension until the end of February.  However, on March 1, Overstock announced that the deal hadn’t closed, and instead of investing $404 million, GSR had brought in another investor, Makara, to “co-lead an investment of up to $100 million in tZERO common stock.”  The new deal was scheduled to close this month, but now it looks like tZERO will turn to look for other investors.  So far tZERO’s major source of funding is still its parent company, Overstock, which earlier planned to sell its flagship e-commerce business this year, but that plan was set aside. Overstock has decided to keep its retail business and focus on making it profitable, executives said on the company’s last earnings call.  Other goals are getting tZERO’s crypto trading app, scheduled for launch in June, into production and opening tZERO for retail investors in August, according to Byrne’s Thirsday’s letter.  “Our retail firm is recovering more dramatically than I anticipated and discussed during our Q4 2018 earnings call,” Byrne said. “In addition, tZERO is on track to introduce the products described in that phone call. Our intense focus on execution is paying off.”  Image of Patrick Byrne by Anna Baydakova for CoinDesk",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/04/18/overstocks-tzero-token-market-misses-closing-date-for-100-million-raise,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/012002ba1d099f0553a0ebe0bd4ac92e9d4f570d-2560x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42430416,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMsWfh,1555617622,"As ICO Business Dried up, This Firm's Headcount Fell From 120 to 50","The crypto market's prolonged downturn in 2018 led an ICO services company to shed the majority of its staff at the end of last year, CoinDesk has learned.  Founded in 2015, Ambisafe provides a number of back-end solutions for companies operating in the blockchain space, particularly in providing white-labeled wallet and token sale platforms. It also provided exchange services, smart contract auditing and modular software development.    ""We see ourselves as the infrastructure provider for blockchain-based financial markets,"" CEO Andrii Zamovsky told CoinDesk.    Yet over the last two months of 2018, Ambisafe shrunk significantly – going from a headcount of 120 to 50.  Ten out of 15 full-time staffers were laid off at the company's San Francisco headquarters. Additionally, 60 contractors at the Ambisafe office in Ukraine were not renewed.  ""We were hiring too fast,"" Zamovsky said. ""I would rather not take some of the projects that we took.""  During the height of the initial coin offering (ICO) boom, the company's revenue rose as high as $500,000 a month, according to Zamovsky. As actions by U.S. securities regulators made the fundraising approach less attractive, business diminished significantly.  Similar downsizing occurred at other ICO-adjacent startups, including Hosho, BlockEx and Nebulas.  Still afloat  Zamovsky told CoinDesk monthly revenues are now closer to $100,000 a month, and that the company has pivoted to focus on services related to security token sales (rather than the consumer-oriented token sales it had focused on previously). Ambisafe is also currently seeking regulatory approval to operate its own exchange in the U.S.  Said Zamozsky:  ""The major lesson is that migration to security token trading did not happen as fast as we expected. Even though everyone knows the future is security tokens, there's not a lot going on.""  CoinDesk reached out to multiple former employees but they declined to comment or did not reply. One former contractor told CoinDesk his time with the firm ended when a contract wasn't renewed, but he had no cause to complain. Another declined to comment due to a non-disclosure agreement.  Zamovsky told CoinDesk the company negotiated severance packages with employees individually.

In the statement, Yang -- who is currently vying for the Democratic Party nomination among a crowded field of candidates -- indicated his goal to “create clear guidelines in the digital asset world so that businesses and individuals can invest and innovate in the area without fear of a regulatory shift.” With the move, Yang becomes the first 2020 presidential hopeful to stake out a specific position on cryptocurrency policy.  Yang cited three problem areas that, in his view, need addressing: ""Cryptocurrency and digital asset markets have developed faster than regulations can keep up....Several states have conflicting and varying regulations on digital asset markets....[and] Uncertainty in what regulatory framework will develop is causing US investment in the area to lag behind the investment of other countries.""  ""It’s time for the federal government to create clear guidelines as to how cryptocurrencies/digital asset markets will be treated and regulated so that investment can proceed with all relevant information,"" the statement reads.  The policy statement additionally cited additional following pledges should Yang be elected president, writing:  “As president, I will...promote legislation that provides clarity in the cryptocurrency/digital asset market space by: defining what a token is, and when it is a security (e.g., recognizing “utility tokens”)....Define which federal agencies have regulatory power over the crypto/digital assets space….Provide for consumer protections in the space….Clarify the tax implications of owning, selling, and trading digital assets….Promote the nationwide adoption of recognition of protections afforded by a series LLC….[and] Preempt state regulations when possible to create one national framework.""  Yang's call for tax clarity is notable, given the push by industry advocates as well as members of Congress on the issue. Coin Center, a D.C.-based firm, also highlighted Yang's desire to focus on state-based money transmission laws.  ""We are happy to see that Mr. Yang is taking the issues facing cryptocurrency developers and users seriously,"" Neeraj Agrawal, Coin Center's director of communications, told CoinDesk in an email. ""He has identified the most pressing issues affecting this technology and seems have come to the right conclusions on how to best address them.""  Yang's statement specifically cites the Token Taxonomy Act -- which was recently re-introduced to Congress in a bid to cryptocurrencies a clearer regulatory footing in the US -- as well as the expansive work done to date by legislators in the state of Wyoming.  CoinDesk contacted the Yang campaign earlier this week for comment regarding its position on cryptocurrencies as well as data on its crypto-related fundraising to date, but has not heard back as of press time.

42430415,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMsWnh,1555614035,NYDFS: Why We Rejected Bittrex's Application for a BitLicense,"UPDATE (April 18 20:30 UTC): This article has been updated to include a response from Bittrex at the bottom.  Shirin Emami is the executive deputy superintendent for banking at the New York State Department of Financial Services.      Bittrex purportedly aims to get the facts straight about the denial of its license applications by the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) in recent statements to the media (including CoinDesk). But, the cryptocurrency exchange leaves out the context necessary to understand its failures to comply with DFS’s licensing requirements, it continues to misstate the facts and it presents a misleading picture about the denial.  First, Bittrex claims that DFS did not provide guidance to the company and that the company’s applications sat on DFS’s desk “for years.” These statements are untrue.  Bittrex either misunderstands or misrepresents the meaning of guidance from a regulator in the context of a license application. DFS’s guidance consists of informing an applicant of the regulatory requirements for a license and pointing out deficiencies that need to be addressed before a license is granted. The corrective work to address deficiencies remains the applicant’s responsibility.  Throughout the application process, Bittrex was repeatedly informed of the regulatory requirements for the licenses it sought and provided with letters describing its deficiencies so the company could address them. Instead, the company spent many rounds of interaction with DFS either promising compliance and failing to deliver it, or trying to persuade DFS that, unlike our other regulated firms, it did not have to comply.  Bittrex’s initial application had many deficiencies, including weak customer due diligence, a lack of transaction monitoring, and an absence of experienced compliance staff. DFS staff repeatedly communicated to Bittrex the department’s concerns regarding these deficiencies. Bittrex repeatedly promised improvements and solutions, but ultimately failed to meet the requirements.  Transaction monitoring  Bittrex’s story of a commitment to compliance is wholly undermined by key omissions concerning its long-term transaction monitoring noncompliance. According to an American Banker article, “[the company’s chief compliance and ethics officer, John] Roth said the company has a suspicious transaction monitoring process that’s partially automated and partially manual. It had been taking steps to fully automate it.”  In fact, DFS repeatedly informed Bittrex that it needed a robust transaction monitoring system. After promising that a transaction monitoring system would be implemented well before 2018, Bittrex finally hired compliance staff to create one in early 2018. After nearly a year of work, Bittrex rolled out what turned out to be a manual transaction monitoring system in December 2018, only capable of handling a small volume of transactions, lacking the comprehensive and accurate risk assessment that must underlie any compliance program.  A transaction monitoring system that is not based on comprehensive risk assessment and uses only transaction size to select targets for scrutiny cannot be called a risk-based system. Attempting to pass off a wholly inadequate limited-capacity manual system, while Bittrex was using rapid fire electronic systems to process millions of trades, could only be bad faith or extremely bad judgment.  If Bittrex continues to tout this December 2018 system as in any way adequate after being clearly told of its shortcomings, it is either evidence of an intent to mislead regulators and markets, or evidence of genuine ignorance.  Customer ID  Moreover, Bittrex’s grossly inadequate transaction monitoring system is exacerbated by an additional deficiency: incomplete or missing customer identity data.  Without accurate customer names, any pretense at customer due diligence or other compliance, including compliance with Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions, is a sham.  As to its customer due diligence failures, Bittrex claimed to media outlets that “the fake accounts cited by the regulator were not active ones.” But, in fact, more than 70 percent of the “fake name” accounts sampled by DFS had been active accounts at some point, and some still contained funds at the time of DFS’s on-site review in 2019 of Bittrex’s operations.  More troubling, in a further sample taken to test customer due diligence processes, 39 percent of sampled accounts had no name associated with the account, never had their identification checked, and could not possibly be checked for OFAC or other compliance. When Bittrex delivered its new transaction monitoring system in December 2018, it had solved nothing concerning the defective due diligence, nor did it address the scale of transaction monitoring needed.  Bittrex’s gross lack of compliance has consequences. When DFS examiners sampled accounts in 2019, their small sample identified two North Korean accounts. More may exist. At least one North Korean account was active into 2017. At least two Iranian accounts were still active in the Bittrex system when DFS examiners visited Bittrex in 2019, and potentially usable.  Listing criteria  Bittrex also attempts to shirk responsibility for the coins it decides to list on its exchange, stating that some coins are decentralized. This is irrelevant since it ignores the fact that listing decisions are made by Bittrex, which has an obligation to conduct appropriate due diligence on all types of assets, and then obtain approval for them from DFS, as required by the DFS Virtual Currency Regulationhttps://www.dfs.ny.gov/docs/legal/regulations/adoptions/dfsp200t.pdf.  What’s more, Bittrex admitted to using an informal process for coin-listing decisions, without systematic documentation. This is just another example of the company’s lackadaisical approach to all aspects of compliance.  Bittrex also objected to DFS’s standard supervisory agreement, which contained provisions that have been applied to all prior applicants, and which are either required by the Virtual Currency Regulation or are an implementation of its provisions. These supervisory agreement provisions require pre-approval of new products, pre-approval of mergers and acquisition transactions, and set forth a capitalization formula that implements the regulation’s capitalization requirement.  DFS’s 2019 visit to Bittrex was intended to be primarily a review of Bittrex’s Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), anti-money-laundering (AML) and OFAC compliance program in the context of its pending applications. It was the final confirmation of the company’s inability to meet the regulatory requirements for the licenses it sought.  Bittrex made promises and representations to obtain virtual currency and money transmission licenses in New York, was given every reasonable opportunity by DFS to meet the required regulatory requirements and was denied because it failed to deliver.    Editor's note: In response to this op-ed, Bittrex provided the following statement.      ""At its core, the New York DFS is overstepping its regulatory authority and changing rules and guidelines on the fly. The sheer fact of the matter is that, despite all of the supposed concerns the NY DFS has claimed, it was willing to agree to a supervisory agreement with Bittrex and grant a BitLicense in January 2019. It was not until Bittrex attempted to negotiate the proposed agreement – and its regulatory overreach – that the NY DFS took such a combative stance as evidenced by the following actions:    ""By attacking a small company that applied in good faith for a license from DFS, DFS has demonstrated that companies should be wary about sharing information with them.    ""In addition, the personal and vindictive nature of the NY DFS’s actions is apparent and it, unfortunately, will only hurt the ability of New York consumers to leverage the benefits of blockchain technologies. Bittrex looks forward to working with customers and regulators across the United States and around the world where we are currently providing safe, secure and innovative digital trading platforms.""  In an attempted power grab, the NY DFS tried to require things in the supervisory agreement that they otherwise couldn’t have asked for under existing BitLicense and Money Transmission License regulations. No other state requires the business-crippling provisions that the NY DFS wanted to implement and Bittrex has successfully worked with regulators to gain license approvals in dozens of other states.  The NY DFS chose to ignore its own rules to include (Rule 504.3) which allows for “manual or automated” transaction monitoring – and then ignored the fact that Bittrex will have fully automated transaction monitoring by this month.  The NY DFS chose to hold Bittrex to standards where none previously existed. There are no standards for listing coins by any entity and Bittrex tried to get DFS to provide a standard, but they could not.  The actions of the NY DFS show that it was focused on retribution, rather than consumer protection. Bittrex continues to deny the use of its platform by any citizens of North Korea or citizens of Iran in 2019. However, if the NY DFS found that evidence as it claims, why did it not share that intelligence with Bittrex in order to remedy or understand the situation?

42430418,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMsWth,1555611362,MakerDAO Voters Divided on How Much to Hike Fee for DAI Stablecoin,"UPDATE: MakerDAO token holders have now voted to increase the DAI Stability Fee to 14.5 percent.    ________    Token holders for the programmatic loan system MakerDAO have once again signaled support for raising fees through a now-weekly online poll.  Starting tomorrow, the winning proposal from this poll will enter into a secondary round of voting call the ""executive vote"" whereby MKR token holders ratify the fee increase and formally activate it within the system.  These fees make it essentially more expensive for users of the MakerDAO system to take out loans and mint new dollar-pegged stablecoins, dubbed DAI, into circulation. For the past few months, an excess supply of DAI has weakened its dollar valuation, which at present looks to be hovering between $0.96 and $0.98 on major cryptocurrency exchanges and OTC desks, according to available data.  In an effort to restrict supply and raise the value of DAI, MKR token holders have steadily been increasing what is known as the Stability Fee in larger and larger increments. However, this week, MKR token holders have signaled their support for a smaller, more measured increase to the Stability Fee of 3 percent.  For the past three votes, near unanimous consensus was drawn by the community for the highest possible increase option available. Last week, the Stability Fee was raised 4 percent and the proposal was supported with over 50,000 MKR staked in favor – the highest number of MKR staked for one proposal in a governance vote.  This week, the winning proposal to increase fees by 3 percent gathered only about 23,000 MKR staked in favor. Other proposals, such as a 2 percent boost, gathered significant amount of support by token holders with roughly 14,000 MKR staked in favor. The highest possible increase option of 4 percent also remains a popular option among token holders with 11,000 MKR staked over the course of the week.  Regarding these numbers, Richard Brown, the head of community development, remarked the weekly MakerDAO governance call on Thursday:  ""There's no clear winner in the poll that we have this week...We're in a situation right now where we have a sort of ambiguous poll.""  This may effect how quickly the 3 percent increase is ratified by MKR token holders in a subsequent executive vote, Brown noted during the call. This is because executive votes in the MakerDAO system utilize a ""continuous approval"" voting process.  In essence, for an executive vote to be approved, the total number of MKR tokens staked needs to exceed the total number of MKR tokens staked in the previous executive vote. For the last four percent increase, the number of MKR tokens staked totaled 120,177.90 MKR.  This time around, more than that total amount will need to be staked in favor of another 3 percent increase for the change to be executed into the system.  But what happens if the executive vote doesn't pass within 24 hours? How about 48 hours?  ""After two days, three days, five days...can we assume it's a weak proposal? Is there even utility for us having it in [the system]?"" asked Brown during the call, adding that a slow executive vote would naturally impede on weekly cycles of governance voting as well.  Looking ahead  During Thursday's weekly governance and risk meeting, Primoz Kordez, founder of blockchain analytics firm Block Analitica, shared new figures about DAI debt concentration in the MakerDAO system.  Kordez highlighted that while there are over 2,000 active loans – also called Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs) – currently taken out by users, about 90 percent of all debt is actually concentrated in roughly 250 CDPs.  What's more, recent changes to DAI supply look to be triggered by one or two large CDP holders as opposed to many.  Opinions do seem to be divided over how effective the last five consecutive boosts to Stability Fee over the past three months have been. Last week's governance and risk meeting featured renewed discussion over other possible measures token holders could take outside of Stability Fee increases such as a reduction to the debt ceiling of DAI tokens.  Originally put in place to restrict the total number of DAI that can be minted off of a singular type of collateral – in this case ether – some token holders think the debt ceiling should also be leveraged to restore balance to the weakened DAI peg.  ""At some point soon, it may make sense to lay off the [Stability Fee] hikes and rely on the $100 [million] supply cap to restore the peg,"" wrote Ryan Sean Adams, founder of crypto investment company Mythos Capital, in a MakerDAO subReddit post last Thursday.  Tomorrow, an executive vote will be activated in which MKR token holders approve the winning governance proposal – in this case the 3 percent Stability Fee increase.  Once approved, the increase will be automatically deployed into the MakerDAO system and all users that have taken out DAI loans will begin to accrue fees at the new rate.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) published its draft framework for a regulatory sandbox on Thursday, a move that comes nearly three years after it first formed a working group to look into fintech solutions.  ""The proposed financial service to be launched under the RS should include new or emerging technology, or use of existing technology in an innovative way and should address a problem, or bring benefits to consumers,"" the draft says.  Operating a sandbox helps regulators such as the RBI to better understand new technologies, while still spurring innovation, according to the document.  ""Applications under block chain technologies"" is listed as a form of ""innovative technology"" that may fall within the sandbox's parameters, the draft says, as do applications related to smart contracts.  However, the sandbox will not entertain any crypto-related projects. These include cryptocurrency or crypto asset services; crypto trading, investing or settling; or initial coin offerings, as well as a few more traditional financial services, according to the document.  (Any products or services which are already banned in India will likewise not be eligible for participation in the sandbox).  The central bank is looking for projects which retail payments, money transfer services, digital identity, mobile payments and financial inclusion, according to the document.  RBI has long looked down on cryptocurrency projects, banning Indian banks from conducting any business with crypto startups last year after issuing numerous warnings against such activity.  Local startups have filed petitions pushing back against the ban, and the Supreme Court of India is currently reviewing the matter. It is unclear when a final decision may be published.  However, RBI is seemingly more open to blockchain tools, and reportedly launched a unit dedicated to researching regulatory frameworks for blockchain last August.

Speaking to CoinDesk on Wednesday, Pascal Gauthier preemptively scotched rumors that the partnership was off.  Without prompting, he said:  “There is a fake rumor in the market that Nomura has ditched Ledger from the joint venture and now is considering other options with other technology companies. So that is not true. That is a false rumour.”  Announced almost a year agohttps://www.ledger.com/2018/05/15/nomura-ledger-global-advisors-building-komainu-secure-digital-asset-custody/, a joint venture between Nomura, security specialist Ledger and investment house Global Advisors was established to bring secure and regulatorily-compliant custody of digital assets to institutional investors.  Dubbed Komainu, the three-way crypto custody partnership was previously thought to be coming to market by the end of Q2 this year. But Gauthier suggested it could now take until 2020.  While he hopes to be able to say something to the market “at some time soon,” Gauthier cautioned:  “I just know that the day we will say something is because we have something ready, whether that is this year, next year. It's complex. What I can say is custodianship is more complex than people sometimes think.”  Nomura did not want to be quoted, but a spokesman confirmed the bank is still very much involved and driving the project and that the rumor is incorrect. Jean-Marie Mognetti, co-principal of Global Advisors Holdings, told CoinDesk: ""The partnership is still working steadily.""  It's tricky  Anyone who assumes that key management is all there is to custodianship in this context is forgetting that the goal Komainu has set includes insurance, regulation, certification and a number of other time-consuming processes, noted Gauthier.  He also said the partners in the project have “a very transparent relationship and if at some point Nomura was disappointed in the relationship with Ledger they would tell us very quickly and we would be having very different conversations right now.”  The Ledger executive said he has “no idea” where the rumors of Nomura breaking it off had come from.  Komainu is “an amazing project” and “we are still on track,” but “we don’t want to be in a position of announcing for the sake of making an announcement,” he said.  All in all, it has thus far been “a truly interesting experience,” said Gauthier, to bring together a large financial institution like Nomura with crypto hedge fund professionals such as Global Advisors with security experts in the form of Ledger’s Vault solution for business users.  He concluded:  “Building this thing together has been something we could write a book about one day.""  *This article has been updated with Nomura's confirmation.

42430423,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMsX1h,1555602924,Bitcoin Fees Jump to Nearly 1-Year Highs – But Why?,"The average fees required to send a bitcoin transaction are up again.  After hovering steadily around the $0.50 mark over the last six months, data shows average fees hit their highest level in nearly a year in early April, according to data from Bitinfocharts. Since then, averages fees have swelled to around $1 to $2, a move that coincided with bitcoin's price ""break out"" earlier this month.  Bitcoin fees are required because there’s limited room in every block added to the bitcoin blockchain – a feature most blockchains face in order to fulfill its goal of giving users control over their money.  When the blockchain gets more popular, a user needs to compete with all the other people trying to get their transaction through. As such, a user needs to spend a bit more money on the fee to incentivize the miners securing the network to push through a transaction faster by prioritizing theirs over others.  What might be contributing this time around? As bitcoin blocks fill up with transactions, fees increase. And indeed, the number of transactions waiting in the mempool saw a sharp spike earlier this month.  As such, sources painted rising fees an inevitability, especially if interest in bitcoin continues to increase.  Seoul bitcoin meetup founder Ruben Somsen, who's been outspoken about fees, told CoinDesk:  ""As long as more people become interested in bitcoin, fees will inevitably rise.""  Inevitable fees  To an extent, this is simply how bitcoin works.  There’s limited space for transactions in the bitcoin blockchain. This is necessary to keep the bitcoin blockchain small enough so that as many people as possible can download all this data to run what's known as a ""full node,"" the most secure way of using bitcoin as it gives users the ability to verify each and every transaction.  Even with a limited block size, it takes roughly 200 GB to store the full bitcoin blockchain, the size of a small laptop.  ""Just like bitcoin is limited to 21 million, block space is limited to roughly 15 transactions per second (4MB block weight per 10 minutes),"" Somsen said.  He added that this limit explains why fees can seemingly jump overnight.  ""Users should be aware fees can rise abruptly, particularly because the difference between full and non-full blocks is like night and day. When blocks aren't full, space is practically given away for free. Once they get full, users will have to outbid each other for it,"" he said.  And while the recent spike in fees is notable, it’s important to note that average fees today are much (much) less than a couple of years ago, showing how high fees can go when hype drives new people to start using bitcoin.  Some cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin cash, have tried to get around this hurdle by increasing the block size. And indeed, transaction fees are much lower for those using the blockchain.  But bitcoin developers argue this approach makes it more difficult to run full nodes, threatening the security of the network and the ability of individuals to truly provide checks and balances on the network.  Meanwhile, since the blockchain is smaller and has less computing power behind it, it's less secure, as it's less costly for someone to double-spend a transaction, thus corrupting the blockchain's integrity.  ""The concern I hear the most is 'How can we get the world to use bitcoin without cheap fees?' This question reveals a misunderstanding between the fundamental limitations of the system and the desired outcome. As much as we'd all like infinitely scaled blockchains with cheap fees, today this is unfortunately not possible,"" Somsen argued.  When lightning strikes  Advocates are hopeful that in the long run, though, fees will be reduced by a new technology that's in the works: the lightning network.  Today, the technology is still in beta (though that's not stopping thousands of enthusiastic bitcoiners from using it anyway). As the technology advances, advocates hope that it will become the main way of making payments on the network (or at least small payments).  Lightning still has fees, but right now they're very low. To get a transaction sent across the network, lightning fees are a fraction of what bitcoin fees are.  ""Theoretically as it becomes more pricey to get a transaction included in the blockchain, user behavior will adopt to either make their transaction use more efficient or switch to other off-chain methods of transacting such as using lightning or something else,"" Chaincode co-founder Alex Morcos told CoinDesk.  And other upcoming technologies could help, too. Segregated witness (SegWit), enacted in 2017, has helped to a degree by carving out more space in the blockchain, and pushing down fees a bit. Other technologies, such as Schnorr, could help as well.  But some experts guess that even lightning fees will eventually increase as well. Like that growing on-chain transactions will push up lightning fees as well. Obviously, only time will tell.

42430405,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMsWVh,1555594504,Bakkt Exchange May Be Seeking New York License for Crypto Custody: Report,"The owner of the New York Stock Exchange, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), is reportedly eyeing a New York license for its long-delayed crypto exchange Bakkt.  With Bakkt's launch having been held up for five months, apparently over persuading the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to approve it to custody bitcoin for its planned physically-delivered futures contracts, ICE apparently sees a license from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) as a possible solution, a Bloomberg report citing several sources said Thursday.  A physically settled contract means buyers would receive the actual commodity – bitcoin – at maturity.  The CFTC is primarily concerned over the issue of safeguarding clients' bitcoin linked to the futures product, and thus a state license may help Bakkt cut through its reservations, the report suggests. That the exchange may also be moving to enable retail transactions using bitcoin for firms such as Starbucks (a Bakkt investor) is also likely a factor.  If ICE can pull off the possible New York registration, it might be allowed by the CFTC to issue its futures by self-certification and sidestep the regulator's requirements that client funds are deposited at a bank or trust company.  Even with permission to custody crypto in New York state, the exchange would still need the green light from the CFTC over the wider operations of the exchange, the report adds.  CoinDesk reached out to a Bakkt representative, but they declined to comment on the matter, as did the NYFDS.  ICE had originally planned to launch Bakkt in mid-December, but the deadline was shifted to Jan. 24. Then, on New Year’s Eve, the big day was indefinitely delayed, with ICE saying its January target “will be amended pursuant to the CFTC’s process and timeline.”  As the regulatory side of things meanders slowly along, Bakkt has been continuing to build out its product and systems.

42430414,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMsWlh,1555592475,Binance Reveals Timeline for BNB Cryptocurrency's Move Off Ethereum,"Cryptocurrency exchange Binance has launched its new custom blockchain, Binance Chain, which will support its $3 billion BNB cryptocurrency that currently runs on ethereum.  Announced Thursday, the exchange said it will activate BNB on the new network on April 23, after which holders of the token are encouraged to migrate their balances to the new network. Old ethereum-based tokens will be destroyed as new BNB tokens are created on Binance Chain, the company said, in order to maintain a constant supply across both networks.  The initial total supply for BNB tokens will be 200 million, 48 million of which will be frozen and 11,654,398 of which will be burned on Binance Chain.  On April 23, Binance Chain Explorer and Web Wallet will be open to the public and Binance.com will be able to help users with the mainnet swap. Users will be able to provide a Binance Chain address for BNB withdrawal requests, with the withdrawal then acting ""as a mechanism to convert ERC-20 BNB tokens into BEP2 BNB tokens.”  The firm said if users want to keep the ERC-20 version of BNB tokens, they would need to withdraw it into an ethereum wallet before April 23. After that, Binance.com will no longer support the withdrawal of ERC-20 BNB tokens. ""Please note that withdrawn ERC20 BNB tokens will only have temporary usage, as all BNB tokens will be migrated to Binance Chain,"" Binance said.  Binance noted that the timeline of the above events is subject to change.  Binance first revealed the development of Binance Chain in March 2018. At the time, the exchange also said that it would essentially shift its BNB token to its own native blockchain.  In a recent live ask-me-anything (AMA) chat on Twitter, however, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao explained:  “Binance Coin on the Binance Chain is the same as the Ethereum coin on the Ethereum network. You will have to use it to pay for network transactions, as gas.”  Edit: This article has been updated to reflect changes to Binance's announcement made since publication of the article.

42430420,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMsWvh,1555588805,PayPal Wins Patent for Way to Defend Against Crypto Ransomware,"Online payments giant PayPal has been awarded a patent for a technique that could detect a type of crypto malware and mitigate its effects.  First filed in September 2016 and awarded Tuesday by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), the patent outlines how taking advantage of existing system data caches can help detect ransomware and prevent it from irretrievably locking up victims' files.  Ransomware can encrypt the contents of a hard drive or other networked files and make it inaccessible for system users, the patent states, so ""a system user who lacks decryption keys will no longer be able to readily access his or her data.""  PayPal, therefore, is looking to prevent such a situation with a method involving detecting a first copy of original content that has been loaded into a cache of a computer system, retaining in the cache a second copy of that file and comparing the two to determine if the altered content represents an encrypted version of the original content. It then prevents the original content from being deleted if the altered content has been encrypted.  The patent explains:  “By detecting that ransomware is operating on a computer (e.g. by correlating between the original data and content in different cache layers), the negative effects of the ransomware may be mitigated or avoided.”  One way users, such as consumers and small businesses, can avoid data loss is by backing up data, the document states. Yet, even if a backup system is in place, data can still be lost, as files that have been encrypted by ransomware may be automatically backed up – overwriting the originals.  Detecting ransomware operations at an early stage, therefore, could help reduce the damage inflicted on victims, PayPal said.  Last year, the company also filed a patent application for a way to boost the speed of cryptocurrency payments. The aim of the concept is to narrow the amount of time it takes for payments to go through between consumer and merchant.

42430422,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMsWzh,1555585216,Bitcoin Price Indicator Turns Bullish in First Since Early 2018,"View  Bitcoin’s two-week moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram has turned positive for the first time since early February 2018, signaling a longer-term bearish-to-bullish trend change.  While the MACD is a lagging indicator, the historical data indicates the previous bull market began following a positive crossover on the indicator.  In the short term, BTC’s hourly chart indicators have turned bearish, so a drop to $5,000 could be seen in the next day or two if crucial support below $5,200 is breached.  Prices may still rise to recent highs above $5,400 if the bulls can defend the that support level and drive price upwards.  A widely-followed bitcoin (BTC) price indicator has turned bullish for the first time in over a year, signaling a long-term bull reversal.  The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram – used to determine trend changes and trend strength – has moved above zero on the two-week chart (15-days) for the first time since February 2018.  With the positive turn, the two-week MACD is the latest addition to the list of indicators calling a longer-run bullish reversal.  Experienced traders, however, may point out that the MACD is a lagging indicator. After all, the technical tool is arrived at by plotting the difference between the MACD line and the signal line, which are based on the backward-looking moving averages.  The indicator, therefore, tends to lag the price and has limited predictive abilities. Further, the longer the time frame, bigger is the lag. As a result, many would consider the bullish turn a result of the recent price rally rather than an advance warning of further gains.  It, however, gains credibility if we take into account the historical data, which shows the last positive crossover on the MACD, seen in July 2016, was followed by a 2.5-year-long bull market.  Two-week chart  On the two week chart (left), the MACD histogram is printing positive for the first time for 14 months, after having charted a bullish divergence, or a higher low, in November.  Notably, the MACD created a similar looking bullish divergence 10 months before the long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change, as represented by the falling channel breakout, witnessed in October 2015 (right).  It's worth noting that the indicator moved above zero four months before the bullish breakout and 12 months before the mining reward halving (which reduces the supply of new coins) that took place in July 2016. The MACD’s latest bullish turn is already accompanied by a falling channel breakout on the chart and has also turned positive 12 months before bitcoin’s third reward halving, due in May 2020.  With history possibly looking to repeat itself, prices may continue to create bullish higher highs and higher lows in the run-up to the halving event, as seen last time around.  In the short-run, though, BTC may have a tough time finding acceptance above the crucial 21-month exponential moving average, currently at $5,239, as discussed yesterday.  As for the next 24-hours, the cryptocurrency may suffer a drop to $5,000 if key support just below $5,200 is breached, validating the bearish indicators on the short duration charts.  Hourly chart  On the hourly chart, the RSI continues to produce lower highs in favor of the bears as opposed to higher highs, while the MACD has turned negative.  The price, however, is still holding above $5,190 – a level, which acted as strong support (see horizontal line above) yesterday.  The bearish indicators would gain credence if the support at $5,190 is breached, leading to a deeper drop.  Acceptance below $5,190 would boost the probability of BTC completing the right shoulder of a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern on the 4-hour chart with a drop to the neckline support, currently at $5,000.  The bearish case would weaken if a potential bounce from the support at $5,190 ends up clearing psychological resistance at $5,300. That could be followed by a retest of the recent high of $5,466.  As of writing, bitcoin is trading at $5,241 on Bitstamp, representing a 1 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

The news source based the figure on the exchange’s U.K. revenue, which grew 20 percent last year to 153 million euros ($173 million), according to a filing with the U.K.’s corporate registry. The British side of the business accounts for “almost a third” of the firm's overall revenue, Coinbase U.K. CEO Zeeshan Feroz told Reuters.  The filing further shows that Coinbase U.K. made a net profit of 6.6 million euros ($7.4 million) last year.  Reuters additionally reported that venture capital firms are investing millions of dollars into the crypto and blockchain space, even if still wary of direct involvement with cryptocurrency.  Around $850 million has been invested in the industry so far this year, according to research carried out by PitchBook for Reuters. While, last year, 117 investments saw VC involvement in the space increase by five times to a record-breaking $2.4 billion.  For example, London Stock Exchange Group led a $20 million funding round for capital markets blockchain startup Nivaura earlier this year. Other major investments include one from Microsoft VC fund M12 and Boston Consulting Group, which backed a $182.5 million round for digital assets platform Bakkt – owned by Intercontinental Exchange, the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange.

Prime Trust, a Nevada-based financial company, quietly entered the crypto custody business last July, first offering cold (offline) storage for bitcoin. A month later, it also started offering custody services for ether and any token issued on the ethereum blockchain under the ERC-20 standard.  Earlier this year, the firm announced that it wouldn’t charge clients for custody of digital assets any longer, in line with its custody services for stocks and bonds.  Purcell told CoinDesk at the time that Prime Trust has other sources of revenue to make up for the removal of custody fees, explaining:  “We make money just as Robinhood, Northern Trust and other traditional custodians do. The costs of custody are offset by other services.”  OKCoin image via CoinDesk archives",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE,Yogita Khatri,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/04/18/okcoin-exchange-invests-in-crypto-custody-firm-prime-trust,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ae60a5504d882410af768a5920fcf7e6b283fff3-960x541.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
