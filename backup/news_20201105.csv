42405401,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMF67,1604611493,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Surpasses $15.3K; Ether Up 210% in 2020,"Bitcoin is hitting fresh highs during a surge past $15,000 while investors may be overlooking the upside of ether in 2020.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $15,087 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 7.7% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $14,005-$15,306  BTC above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish signal for market technicians.    The price of bitcoin jumped Thursday, going up to $15,306 around 15:50 UTC (10:50 a.m. ET), according to CoinDesk 20 data, taking it to its highest price point since Jan. 8, 2018, when bitcoin’s high was $15,360. It has dipped since, settling at $15,087 as of press time.      Read More: Bitcoin Breaks $15K as Investor Numbers Peak      “Bitcoin is above the psychological threshold of $15,000 today on strongly positive momentum, having cleared resistance from 2019,” said Katie Stockton, a technical analyst for Fairlead Strategies.      Momentum, in the form of volume, was strong Thursday on leading USD/BTC spot exchanges. It was $1,233,248,261 as of press time, the highest since Oct. 21 when volume hit $1,273,812,127.      Stockton suspects momentum may subside, which may cause a price pullback. “There are some signs of short-term upside exhaustion from an overbought/oversold perspective supporting a few weeks of consolidation, but we would see this as healthy from a technical perspective.”      Analysts still see bitcoin as an asset to bet on in uncertain times over the long term.      “The U.S. is going to push the spending button again no matter who wins the White House,” noted Henrik Kugelberg. Next year “will probably see more individual support payments all over the world, and some of that money is inevitably gonna be placed in bitcoin.”      “The macroeconomic situation in the U.S. and elsewhere is far more uncertain, and concerns about COVID-19’s resurgence sending the economy back into a tailspin are not entirely unfounded,” noted Guy Hirsch, U.S. managing director at multi-asset brokerage eToro. “All in all, it feels like a perfect storm for retail [bitcoin] adoption that’s coming right at the beginning of an expected wave of institutional capital,” he added. While most markets are up Thursday along with crypto, the U.S. Dollar Index, a measure of the greenback versus a basket of other fiat currencies, is in the red 0.88% Thursday as of press time, down 1.6% since the start of November.      In the futures market, open interest for bitcoin contracts was back at $5.4 billion, with CME’s $804 million taking third place of all venues as institutional investors poured money in. The CME is a U.S.-regulated exchange for larger investors and brokerages, therefore its open interest growth is a signal large players are placing hedges and directional positions as part of some sort of bitcoin strategy.      “Interestingly, while aggregate futures open interest (OI) has risen back to $5.4 billion (late October highs), the increments were very steady and managed,” noted Denis Vinokourov, head of research at digital asset prime broker Bequant. “This suggests that the more regulated entities that operate in the current ecosystem are taking a more pragmatic approach to the current FOMO.“    Ether outperforming bitcoin    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was up Thursday, trading around $414 and climbing 3.4% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Read More: Someone Just Paid a $9,000 Fee for a $120 DeFi Transaction      Bitcoin boosters like to talk about its 2020 price gains as a hedge against an uncertain global economy. However, ether has done even better than bitcoin so far this year, up 210% versus bitcoin’s 95% gains.      John Willock, chief executive officer of crypto liquidity provider Tritum, said investors like ether’s potential as both a hedge and a bet on the possible future of finance.      “Ether holds similar qualities to bitcoin as a general economic uncertainty hedge but also has the added value of utility with the network it powers,” Willock said. “With the long-anticipated forthcoming ETH 2.0 proof-of-stake upgrade, it will, from an investment perspective, become a yield-bearing instrument which has much broader appeal.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are all green Thursday.

42405383,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMErM,1604611310,Square Reports Over $1B in Quarterly Bitcoin Revenue for First Time: Q3 Earnings,"It was a monster quarter for Square’s bitcoin business.      “Cash App generated $1.63 billion of bitcoin revenue and $32 million of bitcoin gross profit during the third quarter of 2020, up approximately 11x and 15x year over year, respectively,” the publicly traded payments firm wrote in its Q3 investor letter published Thursday at the market close.      For comparison, in the second quarter of 2020 the publicly traded payments company sold $875 million through its Cash App with $17 million in profit. Square sold $516 million in bitcoin over the entire year of 2019.      Among publicly traded companies, it could be said that Jack Dorsey's Square has led the way in building bitcoin services, first piloting bitcoin purchases in its Cash App in late 2017. PayPal confirmed its rumored support for bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether and litecoin just last month.      Square went one step further in Q3, however, officially adding bitcoin to its balance sheet rather than simply making it available to customers.      Square acknowledged its October announcement of a $50 million purchase of bitcoin as a treasury asset in its shareholder letter. Bitcoin's price hovered under $11,000 at the time. As of this writing it has broken $15,000.      ""We announced two strategic investments,"" Dorsey said during the earnings call. ""The second was a $50 million investment in bitcoin, which we believe will be the native currency of the internet, and help people thrive around the world and the economy.""    Past earnings    In Q1 2020, Square brought in $306 million in revenue from selling bitcoin in the Cash App. It brought in $875 million in revenue in Q2. However, the margin on bitcoin sales is always quite small for Square. In late 2019, the company changed the way it supported its bitcoin business, shifting to a fee-based model, in order to make costs to buyers more transparent.      Sales of bitcoin in Cash App earn Square a little under 2% in profit, which is a very thin margin compared to Square's overall business, which runs at much higher margins. For example, the company overall made $597 million on $1.92 billion in revenue in the second quarter, or roughly a 31% profit.      Overall, the Cash App also delivers stronger profits. In the second quarter, it brought in $1.2 billion worth of revenue and $281 million in gross profit, according to its Q2 shareholder letter.      Cash app's profit in the third quarter hit $385 million.

DeFi lending platform PercentFinance, a fork of Compound Finance, wrote in a blog post on Nov. 4 “that some of [its] money markets experienced an issue that can result in permanent locking of user funds.” The team froze money markets specifically for USDC, ETH and wrapped bitcoin (WBTC).      A total of 446K USDC, 28 WBTC and 313 ETH , worth approximately $1 million, are currently frozen. Half of these immobile funds belong to PercentFinance’s “community mod team,” according to the post. Withdrawals for other markets are open, but the team is urging users not to borrow from any of PercentFinance’s markets in the meantime.      Read more: Supply of Tokenized Bitcoin on Ethereum Now Tops $1.1B: Here’s Why    The error    In a Discord discussion regarding the vulnerability, Vfat, an Ethereum and PercentFinance developer, said the developer who forked PercentFinance from Compound Finance used “old contracts from Compound instead of ... newer, much better versions.”      Vfat moved to upgrade some of these smart contracts, specifically those that handle the interest rates for the platform’s loans. After Vfat finalized the changes and deployed them, he realized the signatures for the old contracts and the new contracts were incompatible, so transactions could not be signed to them.      “The old and new interest rate models have different function signatures on these all important functions,” he said in the Discord chat. “Essentially the token contract is trying to find an interest rate function that doesn't exit, so it always fails in every interaction.”      Vfat also said in the chat the “Compound [team has] confirmed that this means that the contract is bricked.”    The recourse    In direct messages with CoinDesk, Vfat said it is still too early on in the recovery process for a definitive plan, especially considering no one has had a chance to speak with Centre or BitGo yet, the issuers of the USDC crypto dollar and WBTC token, respectively.      Because USDC and WBTC have backdoors intp their smart contracts, these issuers would be able to blacklist the addresses with the locked funds (even though they are already inaccessible, Vfat said this would be a good “extra precaution''). After the blacklisting, BitGo and Centre could then reissue new tokens to the old tokens owners, something Tether did for a trader who mistakenly transferred $1 million in USDT tokens to the wrong address.      Read more: Tether Still Dominates Stablecoins, but USDC and Dai Are Winning DeFi      A Centre representative told CoinDesk the company can only meddle with USDC transactions if it receives “a valid, binding court-order from a competent U.S. court that has authority over Centre.”      Representatives for BitGo were not available for comment at press time.      For other recovery efforts, Vfat said one early-stage proposal suggests launching new contracts for the USDC lending markets. Though 27% of the loans are locked in the old contracts, these new ones would allow borrowers to pay back the rest of their loans, and so retrieve their collateral and pay lenders back 73 cents on the dollar.      All of the PercentFinance lending platform’s WBTC is locked up, so without cooperation from BitGo those funds are lost to the ether. Likewise, 100% of PercentFinance’s ETH funds were also frozen, and there’s no practical way to recover these funds.      “Regardless of this haircut procedure I am taking responsibility for the full amount of these losses and will do everything I can to make everyone 100% whole,” Vfat told CoinDesk.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH | USDT | USDC,BTC | ETH | MARKET | USDT | USDC,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/11/05/buggy-code-in-this-compound-finance-fork-just-froze-1m-in-ethereum-tokens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/87d0dbe4663e8d32089d126d96d7f854ac6fe4ee-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42405387,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMEuJ,1604608925,Visa’s Planned $5.3B Purchase of Fintech Firm Plaid Challenged by US DOJ,"The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a lawsuit Thursday to stop Visa’s planned $5.3 billion acquisition of fintech firm Plaid, saying it violates antitrust laws and would eliminate competition in the online debit market.      Filed in a Northern California federal court, the lawsuit described Visa as a “monopolist” in online debit transactions and noted its proposed acquisition of Plaid violates both Section 2 of the Sherman Act and Section 7 of the Clayton Act.      According to the DOJ’s complaint, Visa currently operates the largest card network in the United States and has a 70% market share of all online debit transactions. Plaid, on the other hand, provides the technological infrastructure for multiple fintech platforms such as PayPal’s Venmo and crypto exchange Coinbase.      Plaid has also been working with at least two decentralized finance (DeFi) startups, Dharma and Teller Finance.      The complaint said that in making its case before Visa’s board of directors to buy Plaid, Visa’s senior leadership estimated a ""potential downside risk"" of $300 million to $500 million ""in our U.S. debit business” by 2024 should Plaid fall into the hands of a rival. According to the Justice Department, Visa knew losing Plaid could create an “[e]xistential risk to our U.S. debit business” and that “Visa may be forced to accept lower margins or not have a competitive offering.”      While the anti-trust lawsuit acknowledged Plaid’s current technology doesn’t directly compete with Visa, DOJ noted Plaid’s online debit service could become a significant competitor to Visa and Mastercard.      “If allowed to proceed, the acquisition would deprive American merchants and consumers of this innovative alternative,” Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division said in a statement.      Plaid declined to comment but a Visa spokesperson told The Wall Street Journal that the lawsuit is “legally flawed and contradicted by the facts. … The combination of Visa and Plaid will deliver substantial benefits for consumers seeking access to a broader range of financial-related services, and Visa intends to defend the transaction vigorously.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Jaspreet Kalra,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/05/visas-planned-53b-purchase-of-fintech-firm-plaid-challenged-by-us-doj,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/241d73e178865343d8098f6667859493533d478e-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405398,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMF49,1604605047,"What October's Metrics Tell Us About BTC, ETH and Volatility","The phrase “gradually then suddenly” has been overused in the crypto industry to emphasize the importance of each step towards regulatory support and institutional interest.      We had several such moments this month: the confirmation from PayPal that it will support cryptocurrency buying, selling and holding on its platform; more interest in holding bitcoin (BTC) as part of corporate treasuries; JPMorgan issuing a report favorable to a cryptocurrency its chairman mocked just three years ago; several significant fund managers breaching asset under management (AUM) milestones; improving clarity on the definitions of crypto assets and regulated services and much more.      But it’s not yet a case of “suddenly.” We are still in the “gradual” phase. Each month brings progress that seems momentous at the time, but in the grand scheme of market evolution we are still at the beginning. We have left the starting block, for sure. But we are not even a quarter of the way around the track.      In CoinDesk Research’s latest monthly report, we take a brief look at the progress bitcoin and ether (ETH), the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, made in October, as well as some of the stories their on-chain metrics are telling us. Momentum is gathering, as shown by the growing congestion in the Bitcoin network and the technological evolution – Eth 2.0 – in Ethereum. And the use case of each is gradually becoming more clear as market and on-chain metrics start to paint a more detailed picture.      You can download the free report here.    The volatility story    While BTC’s volatility was largely flat throughout October, ETH’s volatility declined. This is likely an adjustment from the jump in September, when the ETH 30-day volatility increased by a significantly greater amount than that of BTC, as seen by the spike and then the fall in the ETH/BTC volatility ratio (blue line). This underscores that the ETH market is still more immature than that of BTC, and could imply that the pending change in ETH’s technology underpinnings is adding a level of uncertainty into an evolving market.    Bitcoin gets congested    Looking at the average block weight (dark blue line), we can see that Bitcoin blocks have been at near full capacity for the longest stretch since May. This can also be seen in the spike in average time between blocks (green line). Network congestion is a common feature of price rallies and usually results in an increase in transaction fees. This more recent congestion, however, has produced a much higher fee spike than in May, even when the U.S. dollar price increase is taken out of the equation, hinting at greater demand for transaction processing.    Ethereum calms down    Average transaction fees on Ethereum fell over 80% in October, retracing September’s sharp increase. The percentage of miner revenue from fees also declined sharply from a high of 75% in September to 30% by the end of October. Both metrics suggest lower user and dapp activity on Ethereum as the hype around decentralized finance (DeFi) applications starts to ebb. This is a positive sign for the network, which in recent months has been pushed to its limits by the splashy debuts of new DeFi assets such as COMP, SUSHI and others.

42405397,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMF3A,1604598914,"Blockchain Bites: Bitcoin at $15K, $1B Silk Road Bust","Bitcoin’s price keeps climbing amid election uncertainty. Wasabi Wallet will offer automatic, privacy-preserving CoinJoins in its coming upgrade. A major Russian power provider is entering into a bitcoin mining joint venture.    Top shelf    $1B BTC forfeiture The U.S. government is suing for the forfeiture of thousands of bitcoins, totaling more than $1 billion, that it seized on Tuesday. These bitcoins are said by the U.S. Department of Justice to be connected with the Silk Road marketplace. The address holding the bitcoins has been dormant since 2015, when the coins were transferred to now defunct crypto exchange BTC-e. According to Bloomberg, authorities seized the funds from an unknown hacker who had gained access to the address. The BTC are now likely to be auctioned, reintroducing them to the market supply. Near equivalent amounts of bitcoin gold, bitcoin sv and bitcoin cash were also recovered from the address.      Fat-fingered Reddit user ""ProudBitcoiner"" accidentally paid 23.5172 ETH (approximately $9,400) fee on a $120 transaction, the person disclosed in a post. The costly mistake occurred while manually entering a “Gas Price” while executing a swap on the DeFi liquidity protocol Uniswap rather than a “Gas Limit.” Mining pool Ethermine processed the transaction and collected the windfall fee, which was way higher than the current average of 0.0022 ETH ($1.07), though ProudBitcoiner has contacted the miner for assistance in potentially recovering the fee.      Mining co-venture One of the largest aluminum and power producers in the world will begin crypto mining through a joint venture with BitRiver, which already owns the largest mining venue in Russia and is looking to expand. En+, whose largest shareholder is Russian billionaire oligarch Oleg Deripaska, owns four major hydropower plants in Siberia that produce about 7% of the country’s electricity. The joint venture (an 80/20 split between En+ and BitRiver) will offer 10 megawatts of power for miners to host ASICs, with the potential to expand to 40 megawatts. En+ was sanctioned by the U.S. in 2018, though these prohibitions have since been lifted.      Exchange expansion Coinbase is hiring in Japan, with renewed plans to launch. While the U.S.-based exchange has not received a mandatory operating license from Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA), in March it became a second-class member of the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association, a self-regulatory organization approved by the regulator. IT, data, finance and accounting, legal, marketing and communications, customer experience, and international expansion roles are currently open. CoinDesk’s Sebastian Sinclair reports Coinbase has had plans to expand into Japan since 2016.      Privacy preservation Wasabi Wallet is looking to overhaul its privacy-focused bitcoin software wallet with user-centric design and privacy improvements including automatic, default CoinJoins. (A CoinJoin is a method of mixing BTC transactions from multiple users to better conceal identities). Separately, Blockstream engineers will roll out improvements to bitcoin multi-signature transactions, with privacy benefits. The “MuSig2” design builds on previous multi-signature schemes – a way to authorize transactions using more than one private key – while reducing the technical complexity and amount of communication between parties to operate.

(Modern Consensus)  Market intel    Bitcoin’s stimulus Bitcoin crossed $15,000, the first time since January 2018. The cryptocurrency is now up 7.8% over the past 24 hours and over 108% on a year-to-date basis, with little sign of slowing. CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole notes this recent rally is represents a ~40% climb in the last four weeks alone. Buoyed by an imminent sense of monetary stimulus, indeterminate of who wins the U.S. presidential election, analysts predict this rise to continue. ""We may not know what a post-election [fiscal] stimulus may look like, but investors continue to believe that the [Federal Reserve] will keep printing money at a pace that favors bitcoins finite supply,"" John Kramer, a trader at crypto liquidity provider GSR, told CoinDesk.    At stake    Anyone's bet Prediction markets are still buzzing with activity amid the uncertainty of the current U.S. presidential election process. Yesterday, decentralized predictions platform Polymarket became the fourth-highest fee-generating blockchain project, according to Cryptofees, only behind Bitcoin, Ethereum and DeFi protocol Uniswap.      Currently, perhaps obviously, the largest pool on Polymarket is “Will Trump win the 2020 U.S. presidential election?,” with nearly $8.8 million in trading volume. While predictions flipped in President Donald Trump’s favor on the first night of ballot counting, most bettors now see former Vice President Joseph Biden as favored to win.      “I think us being top 4 of fee-generating blockchain apps, literally anything blockchain-related, is insanity,” Shayne Coplan, Polymarket CEO, told CoinDesk’s Sebastian Sinclair. “Just in this election cycle alone, we have seen our volume surpass $10 million which is a lot higher than we expected in such a short time frame.”      Of course, prediction markets are not the only way for people to take bets out on election results. It’s likely most markets are, in some way, processing the current moment of anxiety and uncertainty.      For instance, trading in Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) bitcoin futures during the U.S. election has spiked 75% above the 2020 average. The CME is routinely one of the largest, and most institutionally-driven crypto options exchanges. Average daily open positions, which allow traders the option to buy bitcoin between a specified period, was up 20% in just the first two days in November compared to October.      Making sense of bitcoin’s current three-year high, Bill Noble, chief technical analyst at Token Metrics, said that no matter the electoral outcome, monetary stimulus is to be expected. This strengthens one of bitcoin’s core narratives (the things people believe about the oldest cryptocurrency) as a hedge against inflation.      “If there is social disorder because of a Trump win, the Fed prints. If the election result is a blue wave and taxes rise, the dollar falls because the Fed prints more, and more and more,"" Noble said.      Going back to predictions markets: Anthony Sassano wrote, “I’ve long thought that one of the major reasons prediction markets hadn’t taken off yet was due to little to no interesting markets being available to bet on.”      That’s not to say predictions markets are any better or worse than traditional ways of measuring risk. Cami Russo’s The Defiant publication said Ethereum prediction markets are the “best or worst answer” to uncertainty, while Decrypt found FTX’s platform largely mirrors FiveThirtyEight's model.      With election headlines currently dominating the discourse, the stakes are high and the bets are on.

42405388,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMEvI,1604594802,"US Seized More Than $1B in Silk Road–Linked Bitcoins, Seeks Forfeiture","The U.S. is suing for the forfeiture of thousands of bitcoins, totaling more than $1 billion, that it recently seized, the Department of Justice said Thursday.    The seizure on Tuesday, tied to early darknet market Silk Road, is the largest the U.S. has ever conducted, the DOJ said.  Court documents reveal the seized funds include over 69,370 bitcoin and nearly equivalent amounts of forked cryptos bitcoin cash (BCH), bitcoin gold (BTG) and bitcoin satoshi vision (BSV).  Prosecutors say an unnamed hacker stole the trove from Silk Road and moved them to a wallet where they sat from April 2013 until the Tuesday seizure.  The individual consented to the government seizure on Tuesday.  The news comes days after blockchain intelligence firm Elliptic reported that a wallet possibly belonging to the Silk Road marketplace moved almost $1 billion worth of bitcoin earlier this week.  This was the first transaction from the address since 2015, when it transferred 101 BTC to BTC-e – a now-shuttered cryptocurrency exchange allegedly favored by money launderers, Elliptic said. BTC-e operator Alexander Vinnik has been in custody in Europe since 2017.  Earlier this week, Elliptic co-founder Tom Robinson speculated the coins may have been moved by imprisoned Silk Road operator Ross Ulbricht or a Silk Road vendor.  Ulbricht – who operated under the pseudonym Dread Pirate Roberts – operated the darknet website from 2011 until his arrest in 2013 and is currently serving a life sentence.    Since the coins have sat dormant in the wallet for years, unavailable for trading, their confiscation appears unlikely to have played any role in the recent run-up in bitcoin's price. On the contrary, if the government were to auction them as it typically does, the coins could rejoin the circulating supply.      This is a developing story; refresh for updates.

42405400,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMF2B,1604591582,Bitcoin Breaks $15K as Investor Numbers Peak,"Bitcoin's rally is still going as investors continue to accumulate the cryptocurrency, ignoring overbought signals on technical indicators.    Bitcoin rose to $15,017.05 at 10:50 a.m. ET (15:50 UTC) on Thursday, its highest level since January 2018.  The price gains happened as global equities rally. European stock indexes are up around 1% on the day and U.S. stock indexes such as the S&P 500 are up over 2%.  The cryptocurrency is now up 7.8% over the past 24 hours and over 108% on a year-to-date basis, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  Amid the price rally, the number of ""accumulation addresses"" has risen to a record high of 519,228, according to data source Glassnode.  The metric has risen by 3% in the past four weeks alongside bitcoin's rally from $10,500 to $15,000. ""It shows retail flow ... investors accumulating amid the price rally,"" Denis Vinokourov, head of research at the London-based prime brokerage Bequant told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.  Also, accumulation addresses are up over 9% in 2020, meaning investors have been accumulating coins throughout the year, possibly creating upward pressure on prices.  Notably, the number of bitcoins locked in accumulation addresses has gone up 20% to 2,818,447 BTC this year.  Accumulation addresses are those that have at least two incoming ""non-dust"" transfers (representing minuscule amounts of bitcoin) and have never spent funds. The metric does not include addresses belonging to miners and exchanges and excludes addresses active more than seven years ago to adjust for lost coins.  In a sign of confidence in the cryptocurrency's long-term prospects, investors accumulated coins during the March crash and also during the price drop in September. On both occasions, the price dip was short-lived.  The recent rise in both accumulation addresses and prices indicates the market participants are not worried about a chart-driven sell-off and foresee a continued rise in prices.  Bitcoin's 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has been indicating overbought conditions since Oct. 20, when bitcoin was trading near $11,700. So far, the technical pullback has remained elusive.

In an announcement sent to CoinDesk on Thursday, the group, called Dalion, said the ""secure and reliable"" ID platform will give users more control over their personal data, and will be accessible via their mobile devices.  The platform will remove the need for users to fill in ""tedious"" forms, per the release, automatically providing the validated data required by the requesting entity.  Dalion – which includes members such as Banco Santander, CaixaBank, LiberBank, Naturgy and Repsol – says likely use cases include car rentals, insurance and loan applications, and sign-ups at utility providers.  Blockchain technology provides the assurance that user data has not been altered, the group said.  The member firms hope the technology will make user registrations more efficient and will offer new business processes and models, alongside improving the experience for customers.  A proof-of-concept trial found the ID solution worked ""satisfactorily,"" and a second phase of development launches this month.  Currently, the tech is based on a version of the Quorum blockchain from the Alastria consortium, a group member, and is based on digital identity work carried out previously by Alastria.  The consortium is said to have made efforts to ensure its system aligns with Spanish and European Union regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation.  Dalion claims its continuation of the work can prevent duplication and errors; protect users' privacy, as their data is not stored on the blockchain; and can also prevent user activity being tracked.  The project is slated for completion within six months, with a production rollout to follow in May 2021.

42405392,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMExG,1604586180,Lightning Operators Are Bracing for a Bitcoin Bull Run,"With the price of bitcoin jumping to fresh 2020 highs last month, those running the digital currency's underlying infrastructure are pondering the consequences. Namely, the routing node operators at the heart of Bitcoin's Lightning Network are busily bracing for the curious new users that usually come with a bull run.      Bitcoin's Lightning Network promises faster and cheaper payments, without the occasionally crazy fees associated with the underlying Bitcoin network.      Read more: What Is Bitcoin’s Lightning Network?      The platform is still new, in Bitcoin time, having launched for real payments in 2018. As such, it has its kinks. Developers still call using it ""reckless,"" because it's new enough that it may be hiding bugs that could lead to loss of funds. Would the network be able to handle an influx of new users suddenly jumping to the Lightning Network?      Whether it can or not, those who run routing nodes are busily preparing for such a scenario.      Bitcoin Lightning ""routing"" nodes are the ones tasked with passing on payments through the network, until they reach their destination. Many operators of Lightning routing nodes are beefing up their nodes to make sure they can help to support a sudden increase in users.    Why use the Lightning Network?    But first, why would Bitcoin users move to Lightning?      One word: Fees. Bitcoin fees are now higher than they've been in more than two years, reaching an average of $13 per transaction. With Lightning, users can avoid these fees.      ""Higher bitcoin prices go hand in hand with higher transaction fees for on-chain payments,"" Tudor Iova, Lightning routing node operator and founder of BTCfactura, told CoinDesk. He also noted he has seen more users tapping Lightning as fees have risen.      Read more: Bitcoin Transaction Fees Rise to 28-Month High as Hashrate Drops Amid Price Rally      In contrast, Lightning payments usually cost less than a cent, making the payment method more and more attractive as fees rise.      That said, setting up a Lightning channel – a means for sending Lightning payments – requires a Bitcoin transaction. It's kind of like a one-time setup fee for creating a Lightning account.      Say Alice puts $50 into a Lightning account and pays a $3 fee. Once that's done, she can make as many transactions as she needs with that $50 – like 16 transactions for 16 cups of coffee.      With the Lightning Network, fees for each transaction will be negligible, averaging roughly a satoshi, worth a fraction of a cent.    Dodging bitcoin fees    Channels are the lifeblood of the Lightning Network. They're also the means by which Lightning routing nodes pass along payments to others.      But, again, creating such channels requires on-chain transactions, which can be expensive when the network is congested. More transactions in the Bitcoin ""mempool"" – a waiting area for transactions – means higher fees.      Lightning routers are actively scouting out the best times to open channels. ""We're all watching the mempool very closely to find opportunities to open Lightning channels inexpensively as the extra space in blocks dries up completely,"" said pseudonymous Lightning routing node operator Jestopher.      Jestopher expects the block space to become more scarce when (and if) a bull run commences. This happened last week, for instance, after the price shot up.      Another point routers are keeping in mind is that fees are usually lower on the weekends, when users are sending fewer transactions.      Lightning routers are busy learning and researching the best ways to tackle these issues, so that if a bunch of new users flock to the network, payments will remain smooth.      ""What we are doing, and suggesting our users do, too, is to opening channels on weekends, when the fees peak off. Later, during the week, you can use Lightning payments and avoid horrendous [fees]. Else you can end up paying a fee that is higher than the price of the goods purchased,"" Iova said.    Building liquidity and connections    Routing nodes are also open channels with a variety of peers designed to reduce failed transactions and to make the overall network more robust so payments don't fail for users.      ""We are preparing ourselves for a bull run by opening new channels and improving our Lightning node connectivity to other nodes, in order to make it possible for users to use our node Transylvania for payments and routing, when necessary,"" Iova said.      The other trick is that once a Lightning channel is open, that's not necessarily the end of the struggle. ""Lightning requires lots of liquidity management, which is unfamiliar to most folks outside of Wall Street,"" Jestopher said.      In short, it's not enough to just put money into the Lightning Network; the money needs to be moved to the right spots in order for a routing node to build a path that can be used to send payments for users. Not to mention, every time a payment is made by a routing node, this liquidity is moved around. So, routing nodes need to constantly be managing where the coins are.      In fact, there's an entire Telegram channel ""LN mutual balanced channels"" devoted to helping fellow Lightning users find peers and liquidity for their channels. Jestopher recently created a poll there asking fellow routing-node operators what they're doing to prepare for a bull run. The most votes went to ""consolidating liquidity into fewer, larger channels"" and ""opening channels to routing peers"" to build more connections with the network.      Read more: Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Is Getting a Marketplace for Payment Channel Liquidity      ""I think the shared goal is to find out how to operate routing nodes in a sustainable way where we don't have to clog up the mempool when it gets expensive,"" Jestopher said, pointing to Lightning Loop and ThunderHub as helpful tools for boosting liquidity where needed.      Startup Lightning Labs also released a new marketplace Monday for buying and selling liquidity, an innovative way of addressing this issue.    Thousands of new users?    Even if many Lightning routers are preparing, some think the network is already equipped for more action.      ""I think the Lightning Network is already capable enough to support thousands of new users,"" Bitfinex CTO Paolo Ardoino told CoinDesk. The cryptocurrency exchange runs both the second and third largest Lightning routing nodes on the network and was one of the first exchanges to support Lightning payments.      ""Spinning up new nodes and interconnecting them with others is not a very complex job, so I believe that with the growth of the user base we'll definitely see a strengthening of the Lightning global network. I think our Lightning Network node and in general, the Lightning Network global network of routing nodes will be able to cope with an increased demand,"" Ardoino added.      Iova had a similar view.      ""I think the Lightning infrastructure is a bit underestimated, and many people think it can't cope with the traffic, [it’s] not reliable enough or it can handle only micropayments. Well, things are changing in this part of the network,"" he said, pointing to public Lightning network data showing that 2020 brought in a 50% increase in the number of nodes.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/11/05/lightning-operators-are-bracing-for-a-bitcoin-bull-run,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ce5fa5e119f7c902c6d1434a2f1f8287c0c64840-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405393,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMF0D,1604585237,Why Crypto Is the Next Big Trend in Financial Planning,"Cryptocurrency might be a perfect addition to a financial service practice, if you’re trying to grow and maintain your business.      Why would I say this when we know that most advisers would never tell their clients to allocate more than 5% of their portfolio to cryptocurrencies?    Adam Blumberg is a Certified Financial Planner, and has been in financial services for 12 years. He is also co-founder and chief educator for Interaxis, a company trying to bridge the education gap between digital assets and traditional finance. He will join CoinDesk's Bitcoin for Advisors conference on Nov. 9-10 to explore the benefits of digital assets.    The answer is in the demographics and the investment habits, styles, needs and goals of those that do and might find crypto appealing. Gen X and millennials have lived with the internet most or all of their adult lives. They have become used to having all their services on-demand and having the ability to fact- and price-check everything.      Price checking became the norm with financial advisers over a decade ago, leading to the rise of robo-advisers. I was early in my FA career when Betterment and Wealthfront launched, and I saw the appeal. I already had clients asking me about my fees and how they were justified given the returns.      Other advisers just kept telling themselves – and each other – they couldn’t be replaced by a computer. “Our jobs are too important.” And now, advisers are similarly gun-shy about crypto, at risk of missing the industry’s next disruptive trend.      Robo-advisers currently have over $100 billion in assets under management (AUM), and the average age of the investors is well under 40. Those investors didn’t see the need to pay over 1% to financial advisers who did little more than pass the investing function on to third parties, who charged additional fees, only to underperform the market.    The stories are there for advisers to tell their clients and infrastructure is being built to help make crypto a smart play in financial planning.    In addition, we have seen the growth of Robinhood, where 80% of the users are millennials, as well as apps like Acorns and Stash that offer a digital-first and highly customizable experience.      The moral here is, if Gen X and millennial investors want a certain way to invest, save or transact, they’re going to find it and they’re going to help dictate the fees and services. It’s likely crypto represents the next frontier of investing.      Let’s look at that group’s attitudes toward investing. According to CB Insights, 33% of millenials don’t think they’ll need a bank at all, and 83% express openness to alternative investment strategies.      Currently, the age group with the largest number of bitcoin investors is the 25-34 group, according to Grayscale (like CoinDesk, a unit of Digital Currency Group). However, the average age for those that are interested in bitcoin is 42, or those that are in their peak and growing earning years!      Read more: More Than Half of Financial Advisors Want Better Regulation Before Investing in Crypto      Couple those statistics with the fact that this group stands to inherit over $60 trillion in the next three decades and are charted to quintuple their wealth by 2030.      What you have is a group of smart investors with growing incomes and wealth who know what they want to invest in and are wary of paying extra fees.      Crypto gives financial advisors the ability to offer something to those younger investors that many advisors can’t or won’t talk about. Clients want it, and they want help from their advisor. More than half of those surveyed by Grayscale said they would be more motivated to invest in bitcoin if their adviser recommends it.      Crypto can fit in with changing fee structures and service offerings. For advisers who are offering subscription, flat-fee, hourly or project services, crypto solutions fit very nicely. Having conversations about where crypto makes sense, and helping clients understand, buy, safely store and account for their crypto is highly needed by retail investors.      Crypto also gives advisers the opportunity to offer alternative investments to clients that otherwise wouldn’t qualify as accredited investors. From protocol tokens to Reg A+ offerings, crypto investments can be seen as a highly liquid, low-minimum, alternative risk asset, which this generation is much more open to investing in.      While many financial planners shied away from robo-investing because of perceived dangers, it’s important to note cryptocurrencies don’t need to cut into an adviser's revenue stream. For instance, if a financial advisor is using AUM as the main source of fees, that can be maintained either through funds on custodial platforms, or through third-party or separately managed account (SMA) services to manage clients’ crypto allocations.      Read more: Damanick Dantes – 4 Charts Showing Why Financial Advisers Should Care About Bitcoin      The main point is this highly sought-after demographic of clients is interested in alternative investments, and in crypto in particular. Being able to at least have conversations with them, understanding where it fits in a portfolio and being able to relate it to their financial lives and goals is a big step toward winning their growing business. The ability to provide different fees and offering structures is even more important as financial services revenue models continue to change.      Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have had a big year in terms of recognition and adoption. Bitcoin has made significant gains compared to traditional indexes like the S&P 500, while PayPal is readying a crypto payments feature, showing that the industry is not just for dark market trades.      The stories are there for advisers to tell their clients and infrastructure is being built to help make crypto a smart play in financial planning. It’s time for financial advisers to meet the future of digital investments.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,Adam Blumberg,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/05/why-crypto-is-the-next-big-trend-in-financial-planning,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ec570810290038148bde76f751e8387b50d72e41-2400x1602.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The new file sync app lets users pay a fee once, depending on the price of Arweave tokens, and have their data (documents, photos, videos) live forever on the web, without a data cap or fear of censorship.      “We have a good use case because everyone understands it,” Mataras said. “When you look at a lot of these blockchain apps, especially the new DeFi applications out there, it’s hard for people to understand let alone use.”      Arweave operates on the same idea as the recently launched decentralized file storage and content distribution network Filecoin, but with further ambitions toward a permanent and “virtually unlimited” digital Library of Alexandria.      Read more: Arweave 2.0 Gets File Storage Project One Step Closer to Its ‘Library of Alexandria’ Dreams      Arweave founder and CEO Sam Williams added that a permanent Dropbox is an obvious use case of the network. The difference is when you upload a piece of information on Dropbox today, its business model may change in a decade or two, so what happens to that stored data from 2020?      “With ArDrive, the system never changes,” said Williams. “It’s kind of like Ethereum’s ‘code is law’ philosophy, except for web services.”      At this stage, ArDrive is only for users who already hold Arweave tokens to upload their data. Mataras said in the next six months, the team is building fiat on-ramps as a way to expand ArDrive’s user base.      “We want to make it really easy for anyone to swipe a credit card, buy a block and start uploading their files,” he said.      Mataras added that a desktop application of ArDrive for Mac, Windows and Linux will be released in December and a mobile app will follow in the first quarter of 2021.

42405399,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMF58,1604584252,First Mover: Bitcoin Likes Biden (and Fed's Powell) as Price Approaches $15K,"Bitcoin has now doubled its price in 2020, after surging early Thursday to above $14,900 for the first time since 2018.      The cryptocurrency appeared to get a lift from the likeliest outcome of this week's U.S. elections, where a Democratic president is blocked from passing major initiatives (like tax cuts) by a Republican-controlled U.S. Senate. That could imply more monetary stimulus from the Federal Reserve, where Chair Jerome Powell is expected to announce no new actions Thursday after a two-day meeting this week but could signal a willingness to do whatever's needed to keep the economy and markets on track.      Investors are ""favoring bitcoin as a hedge against political risks,"" Lennard Neo, head of research for the cryptocurrency-focused firm Stack Funds, told clients in a weekly newsletter.      In traditional markets, stocks rallied globally, Treasury yields dropped, the dollar declined and gold strengthened as investors reacted to the growing likelihood that a U.S. government led by former Vice President Joe Biden might struggle to enact tax cuts, pushing more of the onus of financing new Treasury debt onto the Federal Reserve.    Market moves    Pundits on Wednesday picked apart this week's U.S. election results as previously too-close-to-call states got called. President Donald Trump, suddenly eyeing the all-too-real prospect of being labeled a loser, started mounting legal challenges wherever possible.      And bitcoin? It took a victory lap.      Worries that election uncertainty might lead to a sell-off in the largest cryptocurrency were quickly replaced by bullish enthusiasm that some form of stimulus, whether fiscal or monetary, would ultimately push up prices for bitcoin, seen by many investors as a hedge against inflation.      The cryptocurrency has doubled this year as the Federal Reserve pumped more than $3 trillion of freshly printed money into global markets. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index of U.S. stocks, by contrast, is up just 6.6%.      The return dynamic could come into sharper focus Thursday as Fed officials release a statement on this week's two-day, closed-door monetary-policy meeting. No major actions are anticipated, but Jerome Powell is expected to reiterate a pledge that the U.S. central bank stands ready to support markets if needed to kindle an economic recovery from the devastating toll of the coronavirus.      ""The policy announcement tomorrow will likely affirm their accommodative stance going forward, focusing on the status quo, and avoid creating policy uncertainty in the immediate wake of the election,"" Denis Vinokourov, head of research for the cryptocurrency prime broker Bequant, told First Mover in an email.      On Wall Street, traditional markets staged a relief rally Wednesday as Trump's Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, widened his lead in the race, with apparent victories called in Michigan and Wisconsin.      Bitcoin also appeared to benefit, which makes sense given that Biden has pledged to push for at least $5 trillion of new government spending on initiatives related to education, housing, health care, paid leave and infrastructure. Ostensibly the Treasury Department would have to borrow money to pay for the agenda, and the Fed would likely have to print money to finance the extra debt.      Gridlock, with a split Congress that stonewalls major legislative initiatives, is viewed by many investors as the most halcyon environment for business continuity, and perhaps a bulwark against Biden's proposed tax increases.      ""Since members of Congress are the ones in charge of government spending, the puppet that sits as figurehead of the nation tends to play a side role in both fiscal and monetary policy,"" Mati Greenspan, founder of the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency analysis firm Quantum Economics, told clients Wednesday in a note.      What's less clear is whether a spending bill, which the Fed says is needed to promote a speedy economic recovery, could get passed during the next couple months if Trump loses. The Republican-controlled U.S. Senate proved unwilling to pass a big economic stimulus package over the past month even with Trump agitating for a deal.      ""If Biden ekes out a win, Trump will have little incentive to push through a deal for another round of stimulus, which could cause markets to sell off in the short term,"" the digital-asset analysis firm Messari wrote Wednesday in a note. ""This sell-off could bleed into bitcoin.""      That's if Trump agrees to go quietly – hard to imagine given his track record of combativeness.      ""Trump is now tweeting about how his lead 'magically' disappeared, setting the stage for a contested election which would likely spell further volatility ahead,"" according to Messari.      The American electorate might be ready for respite from the drama. Bitcoin appears to have plenty of energy.    Bitcoin watch    Bitcoin has surged to around $14,720, the highest since January 2018, representing over 100% gains on year-to-date basis.      While Joe Biden was in the lead in the U.S. presidential race, Congress is heading toward a split, meaning the much anticipated fiscal stimulus could be smaller than previously expected.      ""We may not know what a post-election stimulus may look like, but investors continue to believe that the Fed will keep printing money at a pace that favors bitcoin's finite supply,"" John Kramer, a trader at crypto liquidity provider GSR, told CoinDesk.      The cryptocurrency's convincing break above the June 2019 high of $13,880 has shifted the focus to the record high of $20,000 reached in December 2017. That's because there is very little resistance between $13,880 and $20,000.      That said, the rally is looking overstretched as per technical indicators such as the 14-day relative strength index. While an overbought reading does not imply a bearish reversal, it often yields a pause or a temporary pullback. The rising 10-day simple moving average (SMA) is the support to watch out for in the short-term.      - Omkar Godbole      Read More: Bitcoin Jumps Above $14.5K, Taking 2020 Gains to Over 100%    What's Hot    Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract goes live, in key milestone for blockchain network's ""proof-of-stake"" upgrade (CoinDesk)      Coinbase crypto exchange goes on hiring spree in Japan (CoinDesk)      Unit of crypto exchange ErisX gets OK from U.S. commodity regulators to clear fully collateralized swaps (CoinDesk)      ""Over the next five years, most crypto firms will become banks and bank will become crypto firms"" (CoinDesk)      Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of FTX exchange where TRUMP and BIDEN futures trade, gave $5.2M to Biden's presidential campaign, WSJ Says (CoinDesk)      Russian hydropower giant and aluminum producer En+ opens bitcoin mining farm in Siberia (CoinDesk)      Someone just paid a $9K fee for a $120 DeFi transaction (CoinDesk)    Analogs  The latest on the economy and traditional finance    Bank of England boosts bond-buying program by bigger-than-expected £150B ($195B) as U.K. central bank floods economy with cash (Bloomberg)      China could impose 200% duty on Australian wines as punishment for alleged dumping (South China Morning Post)    Tweet of the Day",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/05/first-mover-bitcoin-likes-biden-and-feds-powell-as-price-approaches-15k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a419e49f1448daa00c73ebabfa6b7c18c24d85b4-1386x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to Cryptofees, the platform is averaging over $100,000 in daily takings and currently trails behind first-place Bitcoin, Ethereum (second) and DeFi protocol Uniswap (third).      The rise is partly due to excitement around the U.S. election, which has seen Polymarket users taking punts on bets ranging from ""Will Trump win the 2020 U.S. presidential election"" through to ""Which party will win the state of Georgia.""      ""I think us being top 4 of fee-generating blockchain apps, literally anything blockchain-related, is insanity,"" said Shayne Coplan, Polymarket founder and CEO. ""Just in this election cycle alone we have seen our volume surpass $10 million, which is a lot higher than we expected in such a short time frame.""      Since going live on Ethereum's Layer 2 transaction scaling sidechain Matic and a product launch 4.5 months ago, Polymarket's liquidity providers have done ""extremely well"" in terms of fees generated, according to Coplan.      While competitors such as PredictIt and Electionbettingodds went offline during the vote count on Wednesday Polymarket remained live throughout the entire election process.      ""There's a lot of services out there, there's a lot of volume but what are people really paying for?"" he said. ""What are people really getting the most value out of where they are willing to pay fees to some market operator?""      See also: Predictions Platform Polymarket Raises $4M From Polychain, Naval Ravikant and More      ""Polymarket had live markets for a handful of swing states and had accurately forecasted and priced the outcome of a lot of these,"" Coplan noted.

About 14 hours ago, the address ""0xe6e2e0cf5d2686d73abd7d3ba24f46ad5eb31819"" – claimed by Reddit user ""ProudBitcoiner"" – swapped 0.2955 wrapped ether (WETH) for 531 chi gastoken (CHI) (worth $120) on Uniswap and paid 23.5172 ETH ($9,430 at time of writing) in transaction fees.  Mining pool Ethermine processed the transaction and collected the windfall fee, which was way higher than the current average of 0.0022 ETH ($1.07).  Often users manually offer a higher-than-average fee in a bid to get their transactions processed quickly. As such, the system is prone to human errors such as typing mistakes.  In this instance, ProudBitcoiner said in a Reddit post that they had mistakenly quoted 200,000 in the ""Gas Price"" input field, instead of the ""Gas Limit"" field, and ended up paying far above the current 31 gwei gas price.  Gas refers to the internal pricing unit for running transactions on Ethereum and is denoted in gwei. One gwei is equal to a billionth of an ether.  The gas limit is the maximum amount of gas provided for a transaction.  According to the Reddit post, the user has contacted Ethermine for help over the error.  Further highlighting the care needed when manually setting fee rates, in June an unknown wallet holder paid around $5.2 million in fees for two ether transactions.

According to a tweet by the exchange's CEO, Brian Armstrong, Coinbase has ""a number of open roles in Japan,"" and is asking others to put forward candidates.  Per the company's website, various roles are up for grabs in the capital, Tokyo, across IT, data, finance and accounting, legal, marketing and communications, customer experience and international expansion.  In March 2020, Coinbase became a second-class member of the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association, a self-regulatory organization approved by Japanese regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA).  U.S.-based Coinbase has been eyeing a Japanese arm of its platform from as early as 2016 and has an entity in the country.

The Hong Kong-based CEO gifted Biden's campaign a total of $5.2 million, behind only former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's $56 million donation.  Biden received $79.5 million from his top 100 donors, compared to Trump's $75 million.  While vote counting is still underway, the edge in donations may have proven effective in pushing Biden first over the finish line, although at press time it's still too early to say who has won for sure.  Bankman-Fried is a member of the wealthiest Democratic super PAC, Future Forward, which includes Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt.  The fund also includes Kathryn Murdoch, daughter-in-law of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, and Patty Quillin, wife of Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings, according to a report by the New York Times.  Future Forward was on pace to spend more than $108 million on television ads in support of Joe Biden in October, hoping to turn the tide among last-minute swing voters.  Other CEOs who donated larger amounts to Biden's campaign include Seth Klarman ($3 million) and Michael Sacks (around $1.7 million). Both are hedge fund managers.

The top cryptocurrency by market value jumped to a 33-month high of $14,558 soon before press time, taking the year-to-date gains to 101%, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  The cryptocurrency has notched up a 38% rally in the last four weeks alone.  Prices did suffer a minor pullback from $14,000 to $13,520 during Wednesday's Asian trading hours after President Trump's victory in Florida and other key states appeared to reduce the odds of a bigger fiscal spending package under Democrat Joe Biden's leadership.  The decline, however, was quickly reversed and the cryptocurrency resumed its uptrend from October lows near $10,400, possibly on expectations for continued Federal Reserve stimulus.  ""We may not know what a post-election [fiscal] stimulus may look like, but investors continue to believe that the Fed will keep printing money at a pace that favors bitcoins finite supply,"" John Kramer, a trader at crypto liquidity provider GSR, told CoinDesk.  The central bank is unlikely to cut down or halt the liquidity-boosting bond purchases intended to lift inflation, and has pledged to keep interest rates low for sometime after inflation rises above the 2% target.  The central bank is expected to reiterate the dovish bias later today and may express a willingness to do more if the election results in a prolonged period of uncertainty for the economy and markets.  "" If there is social disorder because of a Trump win, the Fed prints. If the election result is a blue wave and taxes rise, the dollar falls because the Fed prints more, and more and more,"" Bill Noble, chief technical analyst at Token Metrics, a cryptocurrency research company, said.  According to reports, Biden has inched closer to the White House but the jury is still out, with President Trump filing lawsuits in key states seeking to pause postal vote counts.

42405361,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMCjW,1604563226,Russian Hydropower Giant Opens Bitcoin Mining Farm,"En+, one of the largest aluminium and power producers in the world, is venturing into crypto mining.      En+ decided to enter the crypto space after some experimentation in the field, the firm’s chief financial officer, Mikhail Khardikov, told CoinDesk via a spokesperson. Three years ago the company got mining firm BitRiver as a client, selling power to its farm in Bratsk.      BitRiver owns the largest mining venue in Russia, hosting about 100 megawatt worth of clients’ ASICs on a farm near the Bratsk hydropower plant in Siberia. The firm is also looking to expand to neighboring regions with the blessing of the local authorities. The partnership with En+ will add to the future growth.      The public company is a rare example of a large, mainstream industrial firm entering the crypto world. In this case, it seems like a natural fit: En+, owning four major hydropower plants in Russia’s Siberia, is producing about 7% of the country’s electricity and has resources to become one of the leading players in the market.      Read more: A New Company Claims It’s Opening the Biggest Mining Farm in Russia      Industrial powerhouses like En+ entering the space might change the current power balance in the global crypto mining industry, where China’s domination is reportedly diminishing and countries like the U.S., Russia, Kazakhstan and Canada are trying to win larger shares of the market.    Ambitious alliance    Now, En+ and BitRiver have partnered to run a new farm, with En+ holding a 80% stake and BitRiver 20% in the joint venture, they said. The venue, located not far from BitRiver’s existing site, will initially offer 10 megawatts of power for miners who would choose to keep their ASICs there, with the potential to expand to 40 megawatts.      “Our main business is combining the production of electricity and aluminium, which allows for turning electricity right into aluminium production, instead of selling it via the power grid [to consumers]. Data centers, especially for the mining farms, are an even more attractive way of turning electricity into a product,” Khardikov said.      He added that En+ is happy to see more miners as its clients, and is offering to locate their farms in the direct vicinity of the firm’s power plants. “We have venues with electricity infrastructure readily available, from smaller ones for 10-30 megawatts, to larger ones for 100-120 megawatts,” Khardikov said.      Read more: A Russian Company Is Opening a Mining Farm in the Arctic      According to him, En+ is actively lobbying the interests of the crypto industry in Russia and is talking to both the government and market participants, in hopes of better crypto regulation in the country.      “A reasonable regulation of the [crypto] space will help develop other sectors of the economy as well, such as energy generation and other industries,” Khardikov said.      As for BitRiver, the partnership will help it grab an even bigger share of the market, BitRiver CEO Igor Runets told CoinDesk.      “We’re planning to grow the capacity of our data centers significantly in 2021, and partnering with the largest private hydropower company in the world is important to achieve this goal,” he said. The new status of being a partner, rather than a client, of En+, will help reduce costs and build a better relationship with the electricity provider, Runets added.    Political entourage    Apart from the potential scale of the new mining enterprise, En+ getting into crypto is interesting for another reason: The company’s largest shareholder, Oleg Deripaska, is the second Russian billionaire to publicly dip his toes into crypto and blockchain. Last year, Vladimir Potanin announced a project to tokenize the metals his company, Nornickel, is producing in Russia.      Deripaska was sanctioned by the U.S. in 2018 for being one of the Russian oligarchs who are close to the country’s authorities and “profit from this corrupt system,” U.S. Treasury Steven Mnuchin said at the time.      Read more: Digital Ruble ‘Promising,’ Pilot Likely in 2021, Says Bank of Russia Chief      Deripaska’s companies, including En+, were sanctioned as well. The sanctions on En+ were lifted in 2019, when Deripaska’s stake in the company was reduced – he now owns 44.95% of the company. According to a U.S. Treasury notice, the company has ""committed to significantly diminish Deripaska’s ownership and sever his control"" and now ""Deripaska cannot obtain cash either in return for his shares or from future dividends issued by En+.""      In the meantime, the current regulatory trends in Russia are far from optimistic: After President Vladimir Putin signed into law a measure defining crypto as taxable property, the country’s Ministry of Finance suggested amendments that might prohibit crypto mining in Russia altogether.

42405369,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMCrO,1604552400,"Bitcoin Is Good for PayPal, but Is PayPal Good for Bitcoin?","Numbers go up! You only live once.      That’s two crypto memes to describe how the crypto industry celebrated PayPal’s announcement that, from 2021 onwards, it will enable its 345 million customers worldwide to buy and sell bitcoin and other currencies from their accounts.    Ajit Tripathi, a CoinDesk columnist, is the crypto co-host of the Breaking Banks Europe podcast. Previously, he served as a Fintech Partner at ConsenSys and was a co-founder of PwC’s U.K. Blockchain Practice.    Shortly thereafter, crypto euphoria hit new heights when Southeast Asia’s largest bank, DBS, announced plans to launch a full-fledged crypto exchange. The announcement was later removed by the bank, but the crypto community had found enough reasons already to take bitcoin from $10,000 to $14,000 in two weeks.      DBS’ announcement was certainly more surprising for everyone because it referred to the service as a crypto exchange. Unlike Revolut’s crypto trading app that allows Revolut to trade principal for their customers and offset the risk on crypto exchanges making a margin in the process, DBS’ announcement referred to an exchange rather than an app or a feature. Since I witnessed firsthand a different high street banks’ unwillingness to give Coinbase a bank account in 2017, the news (albeit retracted) was as emotional as it gets in a professional sense.    Good for bitcoin?    Commentators on both the pro-coin and no-coin side were skeptical of PayPal’s baby steps. Believers are disappointed that PayPal’s customers can move crypto only inside PayPal’s network (you can’t withdraw or deposit your bitcoin). Skeptics are unsure if PayPal’s crypto integration gave anything truly new to the customers’ payments experience. Some acknowledged that a giant like PayPal could only ever take baby steps and allowing crypto withdrawals from the PayPal network was always going to be too risky from an AML standpoint.      Two fintech commentators, however, got to the crux of the matter, noting that Bitcoin is good for PayPal. First the FT's Simon Taylor pointed out how bitcoin had increased customer engagement for Square’s Cash App, and then Ron Shevlin, writing in Forbes, highlighted that the need to compete with Cash App likely pushed PayPal to adopt bitcoin.      See also: Noelle Acheson - Why the PayPal Rally Isn’t What It Seems      I celebrated the PayPal announcement. too, although for a different reason. The real value of the PayPal announcement isn’t that people will be able to buy and sell crypto. People can buy and sell crypto already on peer-to-peer platforms like Paxful and the numerous global and local crypto exchanges around the world. It’s that a small percentage of PayPal’s 345 million customers will be motivated to learn about crypto, and a large percentage of PayPal’s competitors will be motivated to see the industry in a wholly different light. In combination, these two factors will bring in tens of billions of dollars in retail assets into crypto over the next two years, turning minnows into tunas and tunas into whales.      Now that we know what’s coming, shouldn't we all quit our COVID-era jobs and retire?    Regulation 10x    No, and here’s why. Where banks go, regulation follows. Outside the U.S., regulators have had a relatively laissez-faire approach to the crypto industry. China and India, which have banned bitcoin or virtual currencies at different points in time, have not enforced such bans in practice. Even the U.S. has been flexible in the interpretation of what are securities and in consumer protection regulation. This is for two reasons. First, most regulators have seen crypto as a fringe pursuit of the nerds. Second, regulators felt comfortable the fiat banking system is not exposed to risks arising from the crypto ecosystem.      Until 2018, regulators discouraged banks from working with crypto businesses. Crypto exchanges adopted stablecoins like tether in 2016-2017 and then broke through the regulatory “fiat-crypto barrier” in 2019 by partnering with small or medium-sized payments companies lacking banking licenses. Today, major exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, Blockchain.com and Binance have three or four banking partners in major jurisdictions with new fiat-to-crypto payment channels coming online every week. Indeed, banks serve payments that serve crypto but rarely serve crypto directly.    Where regulators draw the line    This is why the DBS announcement is much more significant than the PayPal announcement. We don’t know from the announcement that DBS will hold crypto on its balance sheet. But if the bank is operating an exchange, this is likely to be the case.      Unlike PayPal, which offers mainly payments and small consumer loans, DBS is a bank that takes insured deposits from customers and makes large loans to both individuals and institutional customers. While both are systemically important in different ways, after the 2009 debacle of Lehman Brothers deposit taking and institutional lending activities require compliance with a far more stringent set of prudential rules.    Where banks go, regulators follow and bring the entire mountain of compliance and risk management requirements with them.    In plain English, this is no longer about anti-money laundering compliance or token-friendly interpretations of securities laws alone. It is about a vast array of risk management requirements and controls that crypto firms do not have to deal with currently. For example, banks have to hold capital and implement a wide array of technology-, cyber- and data-related controls that cost money, personal hours, audits and processes, which mean lower profits and slower changes. Swiss crypto banks, which were the first to hold crypto on their balance sheets, are required to do everything that banks do and crypto firms just don’t.      Let’s make this simple again. Where banks go, regulators follow and bring the entire mountain of compliance and risk management requirements with them. So when banks start offering crypto services, not only will banks be asked to apply all of the banking regulations to crypto, crypto firms will also increasingly be asked to apply banking regulations.      Seasoned bankers like Caitlin Long understand this dynamic and have worked very hard to both influence regulators and bring banks to crypto firms like Kraken. Two of the large crypto firms for which I have consulted have sought to acquire banks and have been held off only by the sheer cost and effort of complying with banking regulations.      Now that cat has left the bag and there’s only one way this story ends. Over the next five years, most crypto firms will become banks and banks will become crypto firms. There is not going to be a fiat industry and a crypto industry. There will be only one banking, payments and capital markets industry that serves both fiat and crypto.    What this means for crypto    Four things: First, for consumers it means less risk and better standards of asset protection and consumer protection. When KuCoin got hacked, there was no major regulatory response. But if KuCoin was a U.K. bank and had got hacked, we’d have had an army of auditors looking at every paper inside the bank and announcing a major fine and a new set of controls.      Second, it means much lower profitability in crypto and fewer, higher-quality assets. Today, a developer can launch a borrowing and lending service with no know-your-customer compliance, no capital, no risk management and no personal liability. Such a token gets listed promptly on exchanges and, if it goes to zero in two weeks and customers are REKT, there’s no action from the regulators. Once banking rules apply, such an enterprise will be promptly shut down. Essentially the cost of launching new services, i.e. innovation, will go up by 100x slower. More expensive innovation is what we pay as a society for consumer protection and lower systemic risk.      See also: PayPal archives      Third, the overnight returns and venture cycles in crypto will get aligned with the long eight-year venture cycle in the rest of fintech. Harvest Finance, which was recently manipulated out of $24 million in customer funds, was quite fond of describing how its deposits grew much faster than Monzo. What the Harvest Finance team clearly doesn’t understand is the cost of simply launching Monzo is approximately $50 million to $100 million, whereas the cost of launching Harvest Finance is two guys living on ramen noodles in a garage. Further, Monzo is not allowed to lose $24 million in customer deposits and get away with a mere apology on Twitter. In the U.K., Monzo executives can actually be sanctioned and penalized for that sort of failure under the U.K. “senior manager” regime.      Fourth, if everyone is a bank and there are far fewer assets to trade at much higher cost, everyone except bank execs will make a lot less money, and those who lose today will lose a lot less. There will be far fewer exchange hacks, rug pulls, cottage industry scams and other such reminders of the pre-1934 Wall Street.    Is the crypto party over now?    No, in fact it’s just about to get much bigger but less entertaining. Banks won. Crypto believers might feel they have occupied Wall Street, and we might indeed have for some time, but the converse is now becoming true. Banks will increasingly occupy Crypto Street instead. If the announcement by the Securities & Futures Commission of Hong Kong on Tuesday is any indication, the era of crypto firms operating without licenses, registrations and the full weight of compliance and risk controls ends in a few years. Crypto firms like Coinbase, Kraken and Binance, which seem to be taking active steps to get ahead of this convergence and obtain payments and banking licenses, will win big and those that don’t will find it rather difficult to survive as independent businesses beyond 2025.

42405371,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMCtM,1604548800,Wasabi Wallet 2.0 Will Offer Automatic CoinJoins by Default to Boost Privacy,"Wasabi Wallet, the privacy-focused bitcoin software wallet, has set a broad timeframe for the release of Wasabi Wallet 2.0. The goal is not only to make the wallet easier to use as more people start adopting bitcoin, but also to implement the privacy improvements of the WabiSabi protocol, including making CoinJoins automatic by default.      In a blog post laying out the launch timeline of the wallet, Wasabi announced the updated version would get a full UI (user interface) rewrite and user experience improvements, as well as make a CoinJoin easier for your average user. At the moment the team is in the midst of first steps for all three of these developments. While the most likely timeline for release is nine months, it could take as few as three or as many as 14.      The post also said manual coinjoining will be a thing for “power-users only.”      Read more: Wasabi Wallet Is Revamping Its CoinJoin Design to Allow Bitcoin Mixing With Differing Values      “Wasabi adds complications to traditional Bitcoin wallet workflows with its manual coinjoining process and its mandatory coin control features,” said Adam Ficsor, Wasabi co-founder and lead researcher, in an email to CoinDesk.      “To improve upon these we're planning to make coinjoining automatic by default and build upon the realization that coin control is mostly friction when the user would like to spend conjoined coins, so we should be able to introduce a simple send for that.”    Automatic CoinJoins    A CoinJoin is a method for bitcoin (BTC) users to make their payments harder to track by combining multiple payments from multiple senders into a transaction, muddying the ability of third parties to see who paid whom.      Ficsor said his plan currently is that at wallet creation, users would be asked if they want the wallet to take care of CoinJoins or whether they’d prefer to do it manually, as is the case now. Users would also set a privacy target (Ficsor tossed out levels such as none, some, high and Snowden) and then everything would happen automatically from there.      “CoinJoins would be done while the wallet is open (and even when it isn't) so all the user would have to do is use its wallet like a normal bitcoin wallet,” said Ficsor.      He did say that while this is his plan, the final product could turn out differently based on what the team learns along the way.    How WabiSabi improves on CoinJoins    In the original Wasabi Wallet, there were limits to the functionality of CoinJoins.      My colleague Colin Harper wrote about some of these earlier this year:      “For this to work effectively, each user in a CoinJoin transaction must send a minimum amount of bitcoin to the mixing pool (e.g., 0.1, 0.01, etc) so as to ensure that they receive the same output as other users when the CoinJoin is complete,” Harper wrote. “If recipients don’t receive the same amount of bitcoin at the end of a join as other users in the mix, the transactions could be easily de-anonymized by blockchain surveillance.”      Read more: Europol Names Privacy Wallets, Coins, Open Marketplaces as ‘Top Threats’ in Internet Crime Report      Typically, the coordinator of a CoinJoin also has insight into a user’s information, that could allow them to link inputs to a user.      WabiSabi, which will launch with the Wasabi Wallet 2.0, works to address some of these limitations by allowing users to input different amounts of BTC, independent of what other participants put in – which, let’s be honest, is how most people spend money. The coordinator role will still exist.    How this helps the average user    Ficsor said for average users the only uncomfortable thing they might experience with Wasabi Wallet 2.0 is that it may take a while until CoinJoins happen. This means if the users receive coins to their wallets, then it'd be automatically coinjoined in the background, and that may take a while. If users are in a hurry and want to spend their money before it’s coinjoined, they would have to utilize the manual coin control tab and figure it out, given spending non-coinjoined coins without coin control is “privacy suicide,” according to Ficsor.      “That being said, I think in 99% of the cases there will always be coinjoined coins to spend from, so this wouldn't really occur that often.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TECHNOLOGY,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/11/05/wasabi-wallet-20-will-offer-automatic-coinjoins-by-default-to-boost-privacy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0f1f2f83041ec731ca534626f73e01fdd0d08483-2126x1409.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
