The Cosmos community recommends that interested observers follow along by watching the @cosmos account on Twitter.      Stargate represents an important milestone for the Cosmos project on the way to launching its inter-blockchain communication (IBC) protocol that will allow the 200+ Tendermint-based blockchains to interoperate easily. The era of cross-pollinating blockchains is very nearly here.      Stargate enables a number of other enhancements as well. The chain will run more efficiently, upgrades will be much faster and full nodes will be able to sync up more quickly.      ""Stargate upgrades all the software that makes IBC possible for ATOM, but there is an additional governance proposal before tokens can be transferred to and from the Hub,"" Iqlusion founder Zaki Manian told CoinDesk in an email.      It's at least another two weeks before IBC goes into effect, but the software to execute it is now in place.    Read more: Cosmos Set to Take Lead in Blockchain Interoperability With February’s Stargate Release    Many blockchains that will be familiar to denizens of the crypto community are part of the larger Cosmos ecosystem, including the stablecoin protocol Terra, collateral-backed stablecoin USDX, DeFi platform Kava and location verification network FOAM.      ""The Foamspace team is excited for the Stargate Launch coming to the Cosmos Hub, a pivotal moment for the blockchain ecosystem that enables the FOAM Proof of Location radio protocol to be fully realized with global scalability through local consensus,"" Ryan John King, CEO of FOAM, told CoinDesk in an email.      Kava's team is cautiously optimistic about Stargate. ""Before the adoption of IBC can happen, we need to do a robust set of internal testing and review to ensure it interacts with the Kava blockchain as intended. Once this is performed, Kava is excited to release the integration of IBC,"" Kava's CEO Brian Kerr told CoinDesk.      Another founder told CoinDesk he was especially sold on the Cosmos cross-chain vision.      ""The key reason I chose Cosmos to drive technology at my company was because of the planned interoperability between different Cosmos zones,"" Neeraj Murarka, CTO of the Bluzelle, the decentralized dapp data storage company, told CoinDesk in an email. ""I was not simply interested in a siloed network that my company operates. Interoperability is a huge advantage.""      His interest didn't stop there, though. It's also the ability to scale to many users and many ecosystems. ""One of the biggest key advantages I want to exploit with Stargate and IBC is scalability. It is very difficult to scale blockchains,"" Murarka wrote. He hopes Cosmos will enable Bluzelle to reach apps on lots of chains.    Read more: Cosmos and the Dream of Anti-Maximalism    Kava's Kerr sounded a similar note: ""Once IBC is integrated, Kava will be able to rapidly expand to hundreds of new blockchains and their users. We expect IBC to be a huge catalyst in driving growth to the Kava platform.""      True fans can follow along with the launch party, where members of the Cosmos team will perform the upgrade live starting at 5:45 UTC.",POSITIVE,ATOM,ATOM | BLOCKCHAIN | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/02/17/cosmos-upgrades-to-stargate-another-2017-ico-very-nearly-completes-its-vision,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/87e35b4c984ccafb9b9e31dacea6177b97c18c18-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433652,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP03vh,1613600879,Why We Should Take Dogecoin Seriously,"Nothing says 2021 like dogecoin, a dog-themed cryptocurrency that has recently skyrocketed in value, thanks in part to the support of Elon Musk and other celebrities. For a time it was the 10th largest cryptocurrency. Dogecoin finished 2020 at less than half a penny per DOGE, according to CoinDesk's dogecoin price index. It now trades at or above 5 cents, putting its year-to-date returns at around 1,000%.      It may be tempting to write this off as a speculative frenzy or just a fluke, but that would be missing the larger picture. We should take note of dogecoin’s rise, if only because it reflects some of the key tensions of this moment in time.    Emily Parker is CoinDesk's Global Macro Editor.    Here are just a few things that dogecoin mania says about the world we live in now.    There is a thin line between absurdity and seriousness    Dogecoin is literally named after a dog, and is represented by a Shiba Inu. The rapper Snoop Dogg recently rebranded himself as Snoop Doge. If this all sounds ridiculous, it’s because it is. Dogecoin’s creators fully intended it for it to be a joke, and absurdity is baked into its very design.      Today, some of the more serious people in the not-always-serious crypto industry are annoyed by dogecoin’s prominence. They have spent years trying to convince people that cryptocurrency has real technology behind it, even if no one outside of the industry had the slightest idea how it worked. And now, finally, the world is paying attention. Almost every day there seems to be another brand name trying to get in on the action. PayPal. Tesla. Mastercard. Harvard. Morgan Stanley. America’s oldest bank (BNY Mellon). The list goes on, and bitcoin’s price has responded accordingly, passing $50,000 this week.    Read more: How Dogecoin Became So Popular    But now, you have this punchline of a coin taking up some of the spotlight that bitcoin worked so hard to obtain. What kind of message does that send to the non-crypto world?      It sends a message that we should already know: What once seemed absurd to many can become dead serious. Before 2016, much of the world saw Donald Trump as an outrageous reality TV star who had no chance of winning the U.S. presidency. They saw him as a joke, and many still do. But he still held the most powerful position in the world for four full years.      This is obviously not a perfect comparison, and the point isn’t to liken dogecoin to Trump. It’s simply to say that dogecoin “joked” its way to a roughly $7 billion market cap, and that’s real money. It also means that if DOGE mania bursts, some people are going to face some very real losses.    Collective belief can trump ‘fundamentals’    How does this happen? How does something that seems patently absurd become undeniably real? It’s in part because reality seems to be increasingly shaped by collective belief, rather than underlying facts.      This collective belief can prevail over more practical concerns. Until recently, Dogecoin was essentially abandoned by developers, with its last major software release happening two years ago. Others have pointed out that it lacks its own miners, which makes it vulnerable to attack. Critics will say the recent DOGE boom is driven entirely by speculation, rather than fundamental value.      Dogecoin is a sentiment-driven asset. But lately, a lot of things feel that way. Value is created by crowd sentiment and powered by the rocket fuel of social media. The most obvious example is GameStop, where Redditers joined forces to drive up the price of a heavily shorted stock. A more recent example is MarsCoin, which shot up over 1,000% after Musk mentioned it on Twitter.    What’s different now is that social media can translate collective belief into collective action at an unprecedented pace and scale.    Teenagers rise to dizzying levels of fame on TikTok, buoyed by the collective support of fans and the app’s mysterious algorithm. Do those seconds-long videos deserve global acclaim? Are these people deserving of fame? Maybe not, but it also doesn’t really matter. Some are becoming millionaires. This may be harmless, but less so are internet-driven conspiracy theories that don’t have to be based in fact to have real-world consequences. People just have to believe they are true.      Collective belief has always been a powerful force, but it can’t move markets on its own. What’s different now is that social media can translate collective belief into collective actionat an unprecedented pace and scale. Celebrities like Musk have been able to leverage their massive fan bases to drive people to make concrete moves like purchasing DOGE and driving up its price.    People want decentralization, but it remains out of reach    The idea of collective belief is at the heart of money, and thus of crypto culture. Without a shared belief in its value, fiat currency would be little more than paper and metal. But while central governments can print money and have an impact on price, bitcoin is meant to be independent of that system. Bitcoin’s price, to put it simply, is determined by the amount that people are willing to pay for it. In the early days, that was only a few cents. Now, it’s reached over $50,000.      Dogecoin represents an ideal of what cryptocurrency was supposed to be. It is truly weird, and lives outside of the financial system. Its founders have effectively left the scene, leaving it to community rule. Big banks want nothing to do with it. It seems safe to say that it will be a while before we see a major headline featuring both Goldman Sachs and dogecoin.      Bitcoin has clearly grown up, and is gaining the respect of more traditional players. That’s good for mainstream adoption, and perhaps for the industry as a whole. But bitcoin’s maturation has also come with a degree of centralization – outsized influence is enjoyed by big investors (known as whales), as well as certain mining pools and exchanges.      See also: Michael Casey - Money Reimagined: Narratives Wall Street Can’t Control      Musk is a well-known fan of bitcoin and has suggested that dogecoin should become the “people’s crypto” – i.e., a democratic form of money. This taps into the zeitgeist we saw in the GameStop frenzy, which was an assertion of strength by retail investors over big hedge funds. But is GameStop, as entertaining as it may have been to watch, really going to alter the balance of power in the financial world?      Democratization of finance is hard to achieve. So it should come as little surprise that Dogecoin isn’t that decentralized after all. Musk recently pointed out that Dogecoin’s wealth is too concentrated. This claim was backed by Coin Metrics, which noted that the top 100 DOGE addresses hold 68% of its total supply, compared to 13.7% for bitcoin. Put another way, the top 1% of DOGE addresses have 94% of total supply.      Musk has tried to address this problem by urging big DOGE holders to sell, even offering to pay money for them to void their accounts. But it’s hard to escape the irony here. An unfathomably rich man pumped DOGE’s price and then complained about a concentration of power, which he offered to fix himself.      Dogecoin should be taken seriously, if not literally. Its rise is highlighting tensions that aren’t going away anytime soon. We should pay attention to them. Otherwise, the joke’s on us.",NEUTRAL,DOGE,BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,Emily Parker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/02/17/why-we-should-take-dogecoin-seriously,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4424f0c73f843d4d0c4c1fd70c860255686608e7-1420x858.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433661,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP04Bh,1613598010,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Rallies On After Passing $50K Psychological Level to $52K,"Bitcoin broke above $52,000 Wednesday, with a market capitalization nearing $1 trillion.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $52,231.69 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 7.16% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $48,430.80-$52,536.47 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC trades above its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the hourly chart, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin is in “uncharted territory,” said Hunain Naseer, senior editor at OKEx Insights, after its price surged to a new all-time high above $52,000, only a day after it passed the key psychological threshold of $50,000.      Price volatility remains high when compared with major macro assets including the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of stocks, gold and bonds.      “We can expect some consolidation between $50,000 and $52,000, with a possible retest of the $49,000 support,” Naseer added.      Read More: Bitcoin Poised for Short-Term Gains Past $51K as MicroStrategy Upsizes Debt Deal      One bullish signal: a large amount of stablecoin reserves on cryptocurrency exchanges, according to data from South Korea-based crypto data firm CryptoQuant. That could show traders moving stablecoins into place so they can buy quickly if the price is right.      “So many stablecoins in exchanges” compared with bitcoin held on exchanges, Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, told CoinDesk, pointing out that selling pressure is relatively low.      In the derivatives market, bitcoin futures on the Chicago-based CME logged a record high single-day trading volume and total interest on Tuesday, according to data from blockchain analytics site Skew. The elevated activity could be an indicator of rising bitcoin demand from institutional investors.      Institutional interest in bitcoin is also reflected in another market indicator called the Coinbase premium, a measurement of the price difference between Coinbase Pro’s BTC/USD pair and Binance’s BTC/USDT pair, said CryptoQuant’s Ki. The number flipped positive on Wednesday.      “Coinbase [U.S. dollar] whales are like gatekeepers” of the bull market, Ki said of investors with large holdings.    Ether consolidates, institutional interest in futures rises    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Wednesday, trading around $1,828.15 and climbing 4.45% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      On the technical side, ether is in a consolidation phase after losing short-term momentum, according to Katie Stockton, a technical analyst for Fairlead Strategies.      “I view the consolidation as healthy within the context of its steep uptrend,” Stockton said. “The 20-day moving average at $1,556 is a gauge of initial support.”      Read more: Coinbase, Readying for Public Listing, Gets $77B Valuation From Nasdaq Private Market      Ether’s correlation with bitcoin has been flat this month at around 0.68, after it moved down to as low as 0.55 in January.      “As long as bitcoin stays above $49,000 we can expect a rally in the altcoins, including ether,” OKEx Insights’ Naseer said. “But that will only happen when bitcoin’s volatility drops a little.”      At the same time, institutional interest in ether futures has grown significantly, according to data provided by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.      “One week after ether futures launched on CME, daily trading volume reached a total of $75.8 million yesterday – almost doubling Friday's volume of $40 million,” Glassnode wrote in a tweet Wednesday. “Meanwhile, open interest has increased to $62 million.”      The launch of the CME’s new ether futures contract last week might be one reason why ether’s price has underperformed, said trader and analyst Alex Kruger.

42433651,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP03rh,1613592485,SecretSwap Is the Secret Network’s Answer to DeFi Privacy,"The Secret Network, a protocol focused on privacy for decentralized finance (DeFi), has launched SecretSwap, a front-running resistant and cross-chain decentralized exchange. It is now live on the Secret Network mainnet.      SecretSwap uses the SNIP-20 secret token standard and Secret Ethereum bridge.      “SecretSwap is the first front-running resistant, cross-chain [automated market maker]. Its architecture (being based on Secret Network) gives SecretSwap usability advantages, protects users from malicious bot activity, increases the availability of assets and keeps fees much lower than on Ethereum,” said Tor Bair, the Secret Foundation’s executive director and chairman, in a direct message.    DeFi privacy    According to Bair, SecretSwap works similarly to other AMMs, such as Uniswap or SushiSwap. However, because it's based on privacy-preserving ""secret"" smart contracts, users are protected against front-running bots and other types of malicious activity.      Front-running is the act of getting a transaction first in line in the execution queue, right before a known future transaction occurs. Bots executing such front-running operations by paying slightly higher gas fees have been a sticking point for DeFi, and multiple projects have been developing privacy solutions to address this issue.    Read more: Community Behind Privacy-Focused Smart Contract Forges Ahead After Settlement    “Under the surface of every transaction that finds its way to the blockchain, there are fierce wars over every bit of profit,” said Alex Manuskin, a blockchain researcher at ZenGo who has looked at front-running in an earlier interview with CoinDesk.      “If you happened to come across an arbitrage opportunity, or even notice an error in some contract, it is very likely that it will be hard to extract this value without either operating a bot yourself to fend off the front-runners, connecting to and paying a miner to conceal your golden goose transaction, or making the transaction complex enough for the front-runners to not notice.”      The Secret Network’s private liquidity hub is one of the first to launch on mainnet, following the launch of their Ethereum bridge. That bridge lets assets be transferred between Ethereum and the Secret Network privately and essentially offers interoperability between the protocols.    Secret contracts    According to a Secret Network blog post that covered the launch of SecretSwap on testnet, the advantage of SecretSwap lies in secret contracts and the SNIP-20 token standard.      Secret contracts allow encrypted data to be used without revealing it on a public blockchain, or even to nodes themselves.    Read more: New Research Sheds Light on the Front-Running Bots in Ethereum’s Dark Forest    “Since inputs to the swap contract are encrypted, no malicious actor or miner can front-run transactions waiting in the mempool at the expense of honest users,” reads the blog post. “Network fees for interacting with SecretSwap are paid in SCRT (like all other secret contracts).”      The AMM supports pools for secret tokens supported on the Ethereum Bridge as well as those that will be supported in the future.      “We have $50 million in Ethereum assets already locked as secret tokens on our network,” said Bair.    Anonymous NFT auctions?    Earlier this month, the networks launched the Secret Auction web3 app, a crypto auction platform with privacy for DeFi by default. The app lets users create or bid on auctions for any SNIP-20 token (Secret Token) with minimal fees and privacy protections throughout the process.      “Bids are completely secret: Bidders can't see if there are any other bids, and sellers can only know if there have been any bids, but not how many,” reads a blog post on the subject.    Read more: Secret Network Launches Bridge to Bring Transactional Privacy to Ethereum    “Additionally, until the auction is closed, no price info about any bids is known by anyone, and after the auction is closed the only information revealed is the winning bid. This is the first time this has been possible on a blockchain application without a trusted third party – another first for Secret Network.”      There is also a nonfungible token (NFT) standard in development for the Secret Network as NFTs take hold in the mainstream audience, such as one of National Basketball Association star Zion Williamson recently being sold for $100,000 and garnering an article from ESPN.

42433650,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP03th,1613590254,"Bitcoin Taproot Upgrade Nailed Down for July, but Some Finer Details Still Aren’t Finalized","A release date and activation timeline are set for Bitcoin’s Taproot upgrade, but developers and other stakeholders are still debating the best method to coordinate Bitcoin’s biggest upgrade since SegWit.      Per a public IRC chat discussion, the code for the fully primed-and-ready Taproot upgrade will be deployed sometime between March 17 and March 31 (or April if necessary), but the actual signaling that kick-starts the activation process probably won’t start until July.      If everything goes as planned, then Bitcoin’s “economic majority” (miners and node operators who run Bitcoin’s code) could update within two weeks of the signaling period’s start. Come August 2022, Taproot’s activation period will reach its timeoutheight and signaling will end.      Assuming mining pools reflecting 90%+ of Bitcoin’s hashrate support Taproot before the timeoutheight (as one survey indicates), then the vast majority of support would ensure Taproot is a success, and the other 10% or so (the “economic minority”) can update without consequence afterward.      But what happens if the mining pools don’t signal to activate Taproot? Well, that’s where the hang-up is in discussion right now. But for some of Bitcoin’s stakeholders the hang-up shouldn’t even exist.    Read more: How Bitcoin’s Taproot Upgrade Will Improve Technology Across Bitcoin’s Software Stack  True or false?    First, a quick note about Bitcoin upgrades.      Unlike a centralized network, whose central operators can mandate an upgrade whenever and however they choose, Bitcoin’s network is decentralized, so upgrades require deliberate decision-making and discussion among Bitcoin’s stakeholders (namely, developers, miners, business and power users). Taproot is a “soft fork,” meaning a change that is compatible with previous versions of the software (unlike a “hard fork,” where newer rule-sets and older rule-sets are incompatible).      Soft fork or not, at the heart of the matter for activating Taproot is whether to give node operators (those individuals running Bitcoin’s source code) an option to force activate the upgrade if a supermajority of miners fail to support it before the timeout.      This would allow node operators to reject blocks from miners who don’t support the upgrade. This sort of measure (a so-called “user-activated soft fork”) was used to prod along the SegWit upgrade activation in 2017 and is believed to have budged the Overton window for miners to accept the upgrade.      The other option is to not include this feature at all. These Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) options to force or not force the upgrade are referred to respectively as BIP8 (true) and BIP8 (false), also known as LOT=true and LOT=false. LOT is short for lockinontime, a feature that dictates whether Taproot will be ""locked in"" if network-wide activation isn't reached when the timeoutheight is reached; the (true) option automatically mandates the upgrade after the activation window expires, while (false) lets it fail entirely.      Opponents of BIP8 (true) say this aggressive measure is gratuitous because Taproot isn't at risk of failing. As Bitcoin Core contributor Andrew Chow put it, with the Taproot activation survey sent to miners, “the community has already decided to activate, [so] there's no need to [do] LOT=true. Miners are part of the community.”    Read more: All Major Mining Pools Now Support Taproot, Bitcoin’s Biggest Upgrade in Years  Could Taproot activation cause a Bitcoin chain split?    Still others in favor of BIP8 (true) believe it is a necessary feature for coordinating the upgrade, which in the rarer circumstance of extreme discoordination, could split the Bitcoin network into incompatible versions if something goes wrong.      “LOT=true does not split the chain. It strictly reduces the likelihood of that,” BIP8 (true) primary proponent Luke Dashjr said in the chat.      Dashjr shares this view with others, like hsjoberg, who noted, “Lot=true would make sure upgraded nodes mandate a specific chain.” This means that node operators who run true would mandate that the Taproot-activated version of Bitcoin is the “real” chain, so theoretically this would help coordinate consensus between actors to avoid a split.      One brg444 contended that “if lot=true activates there will be a network split.” But this would only be if the forced activation went through. Brg444 said they think this is unlikely, because the threat of this very split would be enough to scare miners into activating before the forced activation occurs.    The ghost of SegWit past    But is a scare tactic really necessary or is it an egregious show of force?      “[In my opinion, people] have PTSD from SegWit … [they’re] being preemptively defensive for seemingly no reason other than they're afraid of past events that now seem to have a low probability of actually occurring,” Lightning Labs CTO Olaoluwa Osuntokun said in the chat, referring to miners originally opposing the activation of SegWit.      “[P]pl are just shadow boxing casper rn lol,” he said later. “Let's give [BIP8 (false)] a shot and revise afterwards if stuff actually happens.”      After all, if six months or so after activation begins miners haven’t signaled for Taproot, then LOT=true could be coded in after the fact to enforce the upgrade.      Still, this would add yet another step to the process, and making this change post-factum would be more cumbersome than just including it in the initial release. But some think it’s a more prudent decision, especially considering the stigma that brands Bitcoin development as a closed garden that is subject to the tending of developers only.      “LOT=true appears as if the developers are forcing a change upon the community. While that may not necessarily be the case, the appearance of that happening is not a good thing. Given that we don't believe there will be any issues with activation, I would prefer LOT=false to avoid this view,” Chow said.    A question of coordination    Notably, the last meeting to discuss Taproot seemed to indicate majority support for LOT=false. With only 100 or so attendees this round (as opposed to nearly double the attendance last time), and some favor growing for LOT=true, though, “we can't really measure ‘community consensus,’” contributor Darosoir said.      According to the Taproot activation wiki, 26 attendees in yesterday’s meeting vocally favored LOT=false while 19 favored LOT=true (some more neutral parties indicated they would be fine with either).    Read more: Taproot Update: Bitcoin Users Home In on Activation Plan, Date Still TBD    Hardly representative of Bitcoin’s sprawling international community, the IRC chatters left the meeting without clear consensus on the precise activation parameters, with some voicing the need to boil down the complexities of the process to get a more informed opinion from the wider community.      “I will say, though, that I think this discussion would have benefitted from having a more clear view of the community overwhelmingly supporting this. Off topic for this meeting, but anyone interested in how to get better data around this, I'd be interested to work with,” Keagan McClelland, co-founder of Start9 Labs, wrote in the chat.      With a date set for the end of March and the bulk of the activation parameters chosen in BIP8, the final question to answer for Taproot’s deployment is whether or not to include the “user activated soft fork” measure from the get-go or not.      Taproot will ship by BIP8 in late March and activation is slated for July, so this question will have to be answered within the month.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | FORKS,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/02/17/bitcoin-taproot-upgrade-nailed-down-for-july-but-some-finer-details-still-arent-finalized,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b0682de264b16b1d2b005a7f595478aea04d0f45-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433656,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP043h,1613584526,How to Bring Off-Chain Assets to DeFi,"The recent GameStop short squeeze has brought decentralized finance (DeFi) into mainstream public consciousness. Well-known crypto influencers such as Caitlin Long have espoused decentralized exchanges as an alternative to traditional clearing and settlement infrastructure. Others, including me, have suggested that decentralized credit markets can reduce systemic risk by enhancing financial market transparency.    Ajit Tripathi, a CoinDesk columnist, is the Head of Institutional Business at Aave. Previously, he served as a fintech partner at ConsenSys and was a co-founder of PwC’s U.K. Blockchain Practice.    In this article we examine some of the key considerations for transitioning from crypto-native decentralized markets to decentralized real-world asset markets at institutional scale.    Institutional interest in DeFi    In my experience, the level of institutional interest in DeFi is currently much stronger than commonly assumed. This is because of five main reasons:      First, unlike enterprise blockchain projects and proofs of concept, which in my opinion have struggled to deliver returns on investment, public permissionless DeFi protocols have delivered clear proofs of value reflected in DeFi trade volumes, market liquidity and fee revenues.      Second, custodians, secure wallets and neo-banks that have built the rails for institutional adoption of bitcoin have already done much of the heavy lifting required for enabling access to DeFi.      See also: What Is DeFi?      Third, family offices, proprietary hedge funds and corporate treasuries flush with cash are actively searching for yield in a low or zero interest rate environment and the digital asset crypto lending environment facilitates 5%-20% yields on a given day.      Fourth, centralized liquidity pools need much more liquidity than they can find currently.      Fifth, decentralized lending provides far more transparency in terms of risk and capital position than centralized lending platforms are capable.    Off-chain assets and NFTs    I really don’t like the term “real-world assets.” This is because crypto assets or digital assets are as real as a paper dollar bill or a stock for me. Therefore, I much prefer the terms crypto-native assets versus off-chain assets. That’s the terminology I will use in the rest of this article.      Most off-chain assets, unlike money tokens and listed stock, are not fungible.      Most people in crypto use nonfungible tokens (NFT) and digital art interchangeably. This conflation is understandable because the most hyped-up application of NFTs in the previous bull run was CryptoKitties, a collection game that pretty much jammed up the Ethereum network at its peak. In the current crypto bull run, 24-by-24 gifs called CryptoPunks have reached valuations of nearly $1 million.      See also: Ajit Tripathi - Why I’m Long Crypto, Short DLT      However, NFTs aren’t just digitally signed gifs and videos for owning and showing off to friends. Nonfungible tokens can point to any asset that is not fungible. For example, unlike publicly traded stock, just about every private equity contract comes with bespoke, idiosyncratic terms and conditions. The same thing applies for bonds with bespoke, contract-specific restrictions and covenants. This “idiosyncratic” or “specific” nature of an asset makes just about anything a non-fungible token. In fact, most financial assets, and not just non-financial assets like art and music, are in fact NFTs and not fungible tokens like money tokens or publicly traded shares.    This 'idiosyncratic' or 'specific' nature of an asset makes just about anything a nonfungible token.    The most relevant application of NFTs that I’ve personally worked on is the U.K. land registry PoC with HMLR. My house is indeed not substitutable for my neighbor’s house and even if identical in shape, design and size, they appeal to different people and sell for a different price. What makes NFTs even more interesting is that you can bind a fungible token, e.g., fractionalized real estate, to a nonfungible token, i.e., a token representing Buckingham Palace. DeFi protocols are proving a range of these concepts and delivering value with natively digital assets and adding overlays to bootstrap off-chain asset markets already.    The challenge    Let me state at the outset that the main complexity in deploying off-chain assets on on-chain markets is not technology. While decentralized technology can significantly enhance transparency, automation and efficiency, addressing three other factors is much more challenging. These factors are a) bootstrapping the market, b) implementing a robust legal framework for property rights and custody and c) asset servicing. Let’s explore each of these in turn.    Bootstrapping the market    Bootstrapping the market involves finding and incentivizing buyers and sellers or borrowers and lenders that have a compelling need to use new, more efficient and transparent infrastructure that DeFi enables.      This is somewhat involved. Crypto market participants who are comfortable with crypto user experience and self-custody generally have much higher return expectations and risk tolerance than those in off-chain asset markets.      See also: Paul Brody - Enterprises Would Use DeFi if It Weren’t so Public      For example, a 10% annual return on tokenized invoices is quite exciting for participants in the invoice financing market. In crypto markets, expectations might be 10x, which of course reflects the market risk of the crypto asset class. Conversely, hardly anyone in the invoice financing markets is familiar with using MetaMask, paying Ethereum gas fees or experiencing 10% daily price volatility.      To beat the inertia of legacy financial institutions, innovators working with off-chain assets will have to focus on finding early-adopter segments where they are.    Property rights and custody    In crypto, the idea of self-custody i.e., “not your keys not your crypto'” is axiomatic. But the concept doesn’t work so well for ownership of off-chain assets such as real estate, receivables, stocks or bonds. In the off-chain world, being in possession of private keys is generally not sufficient proof of ownership and property rights need to be enforced via contracts, regulation, arbitration and court proceedings.      In both off-chain and on-chain worlds, custody is not merely the ownership of a private key but a legal obligation to safekeep assets on behalf of a customer. The licenses and permissions that crypto custodians require in the U.S. tend to be broadly similar to those required by securities custodians. This makes the role of custodians quite critical in the emerging decentralized markets for off-chain assets.    Systems of record    In information management, a “System of Record (SOR)'' is the authoritative data source for a given data element or piece of information. For crypto-native tokens such as ERC-20 tokens or NFTs, the public Ethereum blockchain is generally the definitive official ledger of who owns what and the corresponding transactions that effect changes in ownership. This provides efficiency of crypto native asset transfers and locking assets in smart contracts for DeFi primitives such as algorithmic stablecoins, vaults, collateralized lending and liquidity mining.      For off-chain assets, the on-chain ledger is generally not necessarily the system of record which means locking an asset in a smart contract requires an off-chain legal framework that honors the concept in the off-chain world. In the off-chain world, there’s generally an appointed authority, such as the land registry, enshrined in national legislation that is tasked with maintaining the integrity of the ledger.    Asset servicing    All assets involve the expectation of future benefits, generally written into a contract. For example, a share in a company often pays a dividend, can be split, can be acquired in a tender offer and so on and so forth. Similarly, a rental property hopefully provides an income stream in the form of a rent.      Asset servicing is the task of processing these “events” and delivering the benefits to the owners of such assets through the life of the asset. In securities markets, this task is normally performed by regulated intermediaries such custodians. In on-chain markets, smart contracts are written to automatically deliver such benefits in the form of tokens, native protocol tokens, rebasing and so on.    The path forward    The biggest upside of decentralized finance protocols is that they are like an open road for innovation. As of today, major DeFi protocols have implemented many asset-agnostic primitives such as collateralized lending, automated market making and essential derivative contracts. Essentially the foundational layer of market infrastructure has been laid.      DeFi entrepreneurs working with off-chain assets can leverage all of this open-source technology and on-chain liquidity to innovate and venture capital is available in abundance to do so. Further, unlike enterprise blockchain projects that require big budgets and recurring funding approvals and endless bureaucracy, innovators can combine these DeFI primitives and liquidity with their expertise in off-chain asset markets. This is already happening today.      See also: DeFi Dad - Five Years In, DeFi Now Defines Ethereum      The important thing here is to not bite too much too soon and iterate quickly.      This “composing” markets using existing DeFi protocols is exactly what DeFi innovators are doing today. As they prove the value of their innovation, they will start to deliver the economic evidence needed to change the rules that are built for legacy technology.      In summary, DeFi 1.0 for crypto-native assets is here and it’s a spectacular achievement of technology. DeFi 2.0 will be incredibly exciting and it will involve off-chain asset markets and legal tech.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Ajit Tripathi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/17/how-to-bring-off-chain-assets-to-defi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0bcb6defc5ab19d1c4978a1631769480df72b0c8-1304x926.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42433660,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP049h,1613584483,Blockchain Bites: Why Buy an NFT?,"Digital friction Nonfungible tokens (NFT) are having a moment. In recent weeks, notable investors Mark Cuban and Chamath Palihapitiya have signaled their growing interest in this corner of the crypto economy, adding fuel to a rally that was already red-hot.      It’s tough to measure the size of the total NFT market due to how these tokens are structured. Each NFT is a non-replicable digital asset. Because there’s only ever one NFT, each asset is essentially its own market. The total value of NFT-based crypto art is now above $100 million, according to CryptoArt.io, which tracks the largest platforms dedicated to art sales.    This article is excerpted from Blockchain Bites, a daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    The technology isn’t limited to creating digital signatures on works of art, but has applications across anything online that needs to be verifiably unique from mortgages to sneakers. In fact, NonFungible.com, an industry data site, estimates that crypto art accounts for slightly less than a quarter of the NFT market, according to its latest annual report.      (Though, again speaking of data issues, NonFungible.com estimates the total NFT market to be $250 million, which means “crypto art"" as a sector is worth $62.5 million, far shy of the figure cited earlier.)      The largest market sector – the multiverse, an alternate, fully digital reality – is probably the least understood. While skeptics raise an eye when a digital portrait sells for hundreds of thousands of dollars, at least a painting is something comprehensible.      In a recent CoinDesk opinion piece, Janine Yorio, head of real estate at Republic, wrote that the virtual real estate market is primed to boom. She cites the scarcity of digital land on platforms like Decentraland, the trend towards virtual socialization and the growing number of investors willing to take portfolio risk on digital assets.      Of course, there have been virtual reality booms in the past that have petered out. In 2006, Reuters, the veritable news service, opened a bureau staffed by a real tech reporter in Second Life, though it closed about two years later.      See also: Virtual Property Sells for $1.5M in Ether, Smashing NFT Record      So what makes this time different? Has the simulation glitched, sending us through another repetition in an eternal cycle of boom and bust metaverses? That I cannot say.      But there is one notable difference this time around. NFTs add friction to digital worlds. While a .pdf can be copied and pasted endlessly, there really is only one token to go around (even the image or document it represents is fully replicable).      It’s this programmatic scarcity that is at least in part driving prices sky-high. Investors may be realizing the same deflationary market mechanisms that apply to bitcoin’s scarcity – there will only be 21 million coins – creates similar opportunities to buy and hold NFTs on a much smaller scale.    Sound bites    Decentralized destination Erik Voorhees is taking his non-custodial exchange fully decentralized. By implementing open protocols, Voorhees hopes ShapeShift can eliminate know-your-customer (KYC) requirements for users and reduce the regulatory creep growing over centralized exchanges.      “The key is to follow the rules, and as the rules are written intermediaries are regulated as financial institutions and non-intermediaries are not. If the rules change, then the ecosystem will have to adapt to that,"" he said on CoinDesk TV this morning.    Other stories    Pre-market valuation Coinbase is being valued above the Intercontinental Exchange Inc., the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, in private secondary market trading, CoinDesk’s Ian Allison reports. Shares on the Nasdaq Private Market are changing hands at $303 a piece, valuing the company at approximately $77 billion. Pre-IPO futures on FTX are trading at about $386 at the time of writing.

""I'm really excited about the potential for a consumer financial primitive rather than a financial financial primitive,"" PoolTogether founder Leighton Cusack told CoinDesk in a phone call. ""This is a much more approachable product to people and therefore I think the idea of user ownership becomes much more approachable too.""      Launched in 2019, PoolTogether is a lottery where there is no risk. Users put in assets that are sent to other decentralized finance (DeFi) apps in order to earn yield. Depositors get tickets that correspond to their deposits. One ticket from a given pool earns all the yield on everyone's deposits. That said, the deposits can be withdrawn at any time.      At least that's how it has mostly worked. When it released its latest version, PoolTogether opened up all the parameters to others who might want to create pools for lossless lotteries on all kinds of assets. More on that below.      ""No-loss prize savings is one of the most, if not the most used consumer financial primitive in the whole world. If you look globally in the fiat world, the old-school money world, there's probably hundreds of millions that people have saved in no-loss prize savings accounts,"" Cusack said. ""With PoolTogether, anyone gets it, and because of that, I think giving people ownership of it and control of it is going to be so much more impactful.""      The POOL token airdrop should begin at roughly 18:00 UTC (1:00 p.m. ET), though it could be delayed.    Are you in the POOL?    POOL may have a better claim to the ""governance token"" moniker than some of the airdrops that have come before, because Cusack said the team waited until its app had both a user base and community members who wanted to contribute before releasing it.      Less than 40% of all POOL will be allocated now, with 14% of it going to everyone who has ever used POOL so far, in any of its versions, at any time prior to Jan. 14.      Cusack said it's allocating tokens to users based on the amount they deposited and how long they stayed in. So someone who put in $100,000 for one week will get the same amount as someone who put in $1,000 for 100 weeks.      ""That curve was slightly tweaked to distribute it slightly more evenly,"" Cusack said. In other words, they shaved some off the whales' allotment and gave it to everyone else.    Read more: Lossless Lottery PoolTogether Opens Up to More Coins, More Prizes    Cusack promises this distribution should be good for the small PoolTogether users who stayed for a long time. Like other airdrops, it will just be based on wallets that used PoolTogether. Anyone who has should be able to sign in to the website and receive their tokens.      There will be a brief liquidity mining opportunity for another 5% of POOL over the next 14 weeks, going to everyone who puts assets into one of the pools.      The staff, investors and advisors will get about 20% of the tokens, but they are locked for a year.      After that, the remaining 60% of POOL will be in the hands of governance to decide how to distribute.    Making changes    PoolTogether is an app that pushes people to be more financially responsible, but in a fun way. Now the team is also pushing the DeFi world to be more user-friendly.      Cusack pointed out that participating in governance can be quite difficult for non-technical people. Most governance processes require proposals written in the code that would be implemented if a proposal passes. This means it requires technically skilled people to make a proposal.      Because PoolTogether has a relatively simple set of parameters, the team believes it can make it easy for a non-technical person to make a governance proposal.

42433657,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP045h,1613583616,"Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, UBS Are Trading an ETP Tied to Polkadot’s Crypto","Traditional finance is going further down the crypto rabbit hole than you might think.      Goldman Sachs, ICAP, JPMorgan, and UBS have bought the first exchange-traded product (ETP) that offers exposure to Polkadot’s DOT cryptocurrency for clients, according to Bloomberg terminal data reviewed by CoinDesk.      These banks and brokerages purchased small amounts of shares in Switzerland-based 21Shares’ ETP, the data shows. The shares debuted Feb. 4 on the SIX Swiss Exchange at a price of $22-23 and have since climbed to $30.      The purchases suggest institutional investors’ appetite for crypto exposure in the current bull market goes beyond the market bellwether bitcoin, or even its closest rival ether. The DOT token’s market capitalization is currently over $19 billion, making it the fifth-largest crypto, according to CoinGecko data. The brainchild of Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, Polkadot is a blockchain network that supports various interconnected sub-chains called parachains.      To be clear, these clients are not investing in DOT itself, but rather a security that tracks its performance. They won’t need to download special software to run a wallet, and the ETP meets the mundane requirements of traditional investing, such as an International Securities Identification Number.      “We’ve seen the interest in trading cryptos increase markedly,” said Michael Lie, head of digital asset trading at Flow Traders, a market maker in crypto ETPs. “These products are an easy way to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies, without having to worry about custody.”    Tale of the tape    So far, Goldman Sachs, represented on the Bloomberg screen by the ticker symbol “GS,” purchased three lots of shares on behalf of a client, according to the data.      UBS has purchased 2,770 shares, JPMorgan under the ticker “JPMS” purchased 500 shares, ICAP purchased 1,000 shares, Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch under the ticker “MLCO” purchased 2,200 shares.      Kepler Securities under the ticker “KEPL” purchased 550 shares, broker-dealer Instinet, owned by Japan’s Nomura and trading under the ticker “INCA,” purchased 9,280 shares, and Flow Traders, trading under the ticker “FLOW” purchased 6,897 shares.      A spokesperson for Goldman Sachs said it had no knowledge of the trades and would look into it. Requests for comment from the other banks and brokerages were not returned by press time.      There has also been an increasing number of ETPs being listed on the SIX exchange. As of Jan. 13, the exchange reported there were six ETP providers with cryptocurrency products listed on the exchange and the number of ETPs listed was 34.      The Polkadot ETP now has over $15 million in assets under management, said Laurent Kssis, Head of ETP with 21Shares. The firm also manages the Crypto Basket Index ETP, which tracks the performance of five major cryptocurrencies. Polkadot is now the second-largest component of the index, Kssis said.      Read more: Goldman Sachs to Enter Crypto Market ‘Soon’ With Custody Play: Source      On Jan. 6, the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority banned retail investors from accessing cryptocurrency exchange-traded notes, another type of ETP, explaining it considers the products too risky for everyday consumers. Despite the ban, the Bloomberg data shows there is strong demand for crypto ETPs from big-money investors.      Traditional financial institutions have signaled an interest in handling actual cryptocurrency, not just proxy instruments. In January, for example, CoinDesk reported that Goldman Sachs had issued a request for information (RFI) to explore digital asset custody.",POSITIVE,DOT,BUSINESS | DOT | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Tanzeel Akhtar,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/17/goldman-sachs-jpmorgan-ubs-are-trading-an-etp-tied-to-polkadots-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b3ab286a6e9d57e43a1d17247422fb73d3f1f6fb-1200x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433647,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP03ph,1613580868,DOJ Charges 3 North Korean Hackers With Stealing $100M+ From Crypto Firms,"The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has charged three North Korean computer programmers with theft and extortion on various allegations, including stealing over $100 million in cryptocurrencies between 2017 and 2020.      The thefts are part of a broader conspiracy in which the alleged hackers stole over $1.3 billion, the DOJ announced Wednesday. In a related second case, a Canadian-American was charged with participating in a money laundering scheme.      In a statement, Assistant Attorney General John Demers said, ""As laid out in today’s indictment, North Korea’s operatives, using keyboards rather than guns, stealing digital wallets of cryptocurrency instead of sacks of cash, are the world’s leading bank robbers.""      Jon Chang Hyok, Kim Il and Park Jin Hyok have been charged with criminal hacking and other crimes, and are allegedly a part of the Lazarus Group cybercrime ring, according to a press release. The three were allegedly behind the 2014 hack of Sony Pictures Entertainment, which appeared to be a retaliatory move for producing The Interview, a comedy film about the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.      The hackers targeted ""hundreds of cryptocurrency companies"" and stole ""tens of millions of dollars' worth of cryptocurrency,"" according to the press release.      This included ""$75 million from a Slovenian cryptocurrency company in December 2017; $24.9 million from an Indonesian cryptocurrency company in September 2018; and $11.8 million from a financial services company in New York in August 2020 in which the hackers used the malicious CryptoNeuro Trader application as a backdoor,"" the press release said.      Just last week, the United Nations alleged that North Korea was funding its nuclear weapons program using funds from hacked cryptocurrency exchanges, alongside other thefts. The U.N. believes that over $300 million in crypto assets have been stolen by various North Korean hackers.    Initial coin offerings    The defendants raised funds using initial coin offerings (ICOs) as well, the indictment alleged. Specifically, it claims that Kim Il tried raising funds through the Marine Chain ICO, which the U.N. suspected was affiliated with the North Korean government last year.      The defendants created a digital token representing fractional ownership in marine shipping vessels and marketed it to individuals in Singapore, the indictment alleged.      ""Defendant KIM IL and other conspirators would not disclose to these individuals that the conspirators were DPRK citizens or that they were communicating using false and fraudulent names. They also would not disclose to investors that a purpose of the Marine Chain Token was to evade United States sanctions on North Korea,"" the indictment said.      It's unclear how much the Marine Chain ICO raised.      Evan Kohlmann, the chief innovation officer of cybersecurity and risk intelligence firm Flashpoint, told CoinDesk, “Countries like North Korea will continue to create schemes to avoid U.S. sanctions. The DoJ indictment highlights the breadth of North Korean malicious cyber intrusions targeting entertainment, finance, defense, energy, government, and technology companies.""      Countries could try cashing out through ATMs in addition to using ICOs or malware to steal cryptocurrencies, he said.    Advisory    In addition to Wednesday's indictment, the FBI, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and Department of Treasury published a joint advisory about a crypto malware produced by North Korea.      The advisory, which includes seven malware analysis reports (MARs) with technical details about the AppleJeus malware, details how the program was installed on victim machines.      ""This report catalogues AppleJeus malware in detail. North Korea has used AppleJeus malware posing as cryptocurrency trading platforms since at least 2018. In most instances, the malicious application – seen on both Windows and Mac operating systems – appears to be from a legitimate cryptocurrency trading company, thus fooling individuals into downloading it as a third-party application from a website that seems legitimate,"" the notice said.      The threat actors targeted companies in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, India, China, Russia, Israel, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and over a dozen others, according to the alert.

The bill proposes to recognize cryptocurrency as property for purposes of taxation, which Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin has previously said would bring holders legal protection and rights in court disputes.  Crypto users would be required to declare receipts of cryptocurrency exceeding 600,000 rubles ($8,184) per year.  Failure to declare would result in a fine of 10% of the undeclared amount or a writing off of such currency, whichever is larger.  A penalty of 40% of the required amount of tax will be applied for non-payment or incomplete payment of tax.  Ahead of the bill's second reading, the State Duma Committee on Budget and Taxes is questioning the validity of the Federal Tax Service's right to establish the procedure for determining a crypto's market price, as this does not comply with existing provisions of the Tax Code.  Crypto assets will not be a legal means of payment under the proposed change to the tax law.

42411932,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glhDka,1613576700,What Is a Flash Loan?,"A flash loan is a type of uncollateralized lending that is popular across a number of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols based on the Ethereum network.  These types of loans have made headlines because they have been used to exploit a number of vulnerable DeFi protocols, leading to millions of dollars in losses. Yet, advocates argue flash loans introduce an innovative and useful tool to the world of finance for arbitrage and quick tradesthat weren’t possible before blockchains.  Most of us are familiar with normal loans. A lender loans out money to a borrower to be eventually paid back in full. The lender receives a payout from the borrower for temporarily parting with its money.  Flash loans are similar, but they have the following unique properties:  Smart contracts: Flash loans use smart contracts, tools enabled by a blockchain that don't let funds change hands unless certain rules are met. In the case of a flash loan, the rule is that the borrower must pay back the loan before the transaction ends, otherwise the smart contract reverses the transaction – so it’s like the loan never happened in the first place.  Unsecured loan: Often lenders require borrowers to put up collateral to ensure that if the borrower can't pay back the loan the lender is still able to get their money back. But in an unsecured loan, no collateral is required. This lack of collateral doesn't mean the flash loan lender will not get its money back. It's just sent back in a different way. Instead of offering collateral, the borrower needs to pay back the money right away, which brings us to our next point.  Instant: Usually, obtaining and fulfilling a loan is a long process. If a borrower gets approved for a loan, he or she typically has to pay it back steadily over a period of months or years. A flash loan, however, is instantaneous. The smart contract for the loan must be fulfilled in the same transaction that it is lent out. This means the borrower has to call on other smart contracts to perform instant trades with the loaned capital before the transaction ends, which is usually a few seconds.  This type of loan can be useful in certain instances, such as for traders looking to quickly profit from arbitrage opportunities when two markets are pricing a cryptocurrency differently.  Ethereum lending platform Aave pioneered the idea in early 2020. The concept is new and still has a lot of kinks because new hacks are making abundantly clear. ""There is no real-world analogy to Flash Loans,"" as the Ethereum lending platform Aave puts it in its documentationhttps://docs.aave.com/developers/tutorials/performing-a-flash-loan.  Flash loan FAQs  Where does Ethereum fit into flash loans?  This speed and other unique properties are enabled by Ethereum, which aims to expand blockchain to other use cases beyond simple transactions. Flash loans are one popular experiment amid Ethereum's decentralized finance movement, which has cultivated financial alternatives withoutintermediaries. Instead, by using DeFi apps, users are supposed to be more in control of the financial instruments, such as loans, derivatives and other contracts.  Advocates argue DeFi-style apps could give users more control over their finances, in contrast to big Wall Street corporations and other traditional financial institutions.  But that's not why everyone is interested. DeFi has also drawn a lot of enthusiasm because a some traders have succeeded in making high returns from speculating on new coins.  Why would I want to use a flash loan?  In short, it's one way to potentially make substantial gains without having to risk your own money.  There are times when the unheard-of speed of a flash loan makes sense.  Flash loans can be used for:  Arbitrage: Traders can make money by looking for price discrepancies across a number of different exchanges. Say two markets are pricing pizzacoin differently. It's priced at $1 on Exchange A and $2 on Exchange B. A user can use a flash loan and call a separate smart contract to buy 100 pizzacoins for $100 at Exchange A, then sell them for $200 at Exchange B. The borrower then repays the loan and pockets the difference.  Collateral swaps: Quickly swapping the collateral backing the user's loan for another type of collateral.  Lower transaction fees: In a sense, flash loans roll what would normally take several transactions into one. Each transaction costs a fee so flash loans potentially mean lower fees.  Aave describes some other potential use cases here.  Can I make money with a flash loan?  Potentially, provided you have thoroughly researched both the protocol you intend to borrow from and send the borrowed capital to. Some people have used these types of loans to earn money very quickly. But as attacks on flash loans have shown, the technology is definitely not without risks.  How do I use a flash loan?  Flash loans are available on a variety of Ethereum-based DeFi lending platforms, such as Aave and dYdX.  They started off as a tool solely for those tech-savvy enough to use the command line, a method for developers to send textual commands to a computer. But now more user-friendly interfaces are emerging, too.  What if I don't pay back a flash loan?  Then you won't get the loan in the first place.  Remember that the entire flash loan takes place within just a single transaction. If both parties, the lender and the borrower, fail to follow the rules, the loan won't be issued. That's the advantage of a smart contract. It won't allow money to move unless a condition is met.  So if the money isn't paid back by the borrower instantly in the transaction, the smart contract will simply reverse the transaction and hand the money back to the lender.  How secure are flash loans?  Flash loans have been the subject of several attacks leading to millions of dollars in losses. There are an array of ways that malicious actors can game the loaning mechanism.  This highlights a broader problem with Ethereum and DeFi. The problem is that smart contracts can be gamed if they aren't written to execute exactly as intended or if the data flowing into them is corrupted or exploitable. But the technology is new. Some argue that these kinds of issues will evaporate as the technology matures, while others believe these attacks will remain a persistent challenge.  How does a flash loan ‘attack’ work?  Flash loans are less than a year old and there have already been a long line of attacks, with different characteristics.  Ethereum trading and lending protocol bZX was the subject of a flash loan attack where the borrower was able to trick the lender into thinking he or she repaid them in full, but the borrower really hadn't. This was done by temporarily pushing up the price of the stablecoin being used to repay the loan.  In another event, one entity used a flash loan to secure extra votes in a MakerDAO vote impacting the whole community.  Meanwhile, computer science researchers wrote a post at security blog Hacking Distributed exploring some of the ways to attack flash loans ""for fun and profit.""  These are just a couple of examples of flash loans not being used as intended. Engineers are looking into various ways to ensure they work without unexpected loopholes.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-is-a-flash-loan,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/257fb7816de96f70accda539870e29d129d828e2-1885x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405905,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAepLIL,1613572229,Why the US Needs Bitcoin,"The United States will adopt bitcoin as a reserve asset.      Why? Because it is unequivocally in U.S. strategic interests to do so.    Alex Treece is a co-founder at Zabo, a platform enabling fintechs and financial services companies to easily connect cryptocurrency accounts to their applications.    The question is not if this will happen, but when. Whether it happens within 12 months, two years, five years or 10 years will have major implications for U.S. positioning for decades. Failure to embrace bitcoin sooner rather than later will damage U.S. strategic interests and benefit rivals adopting it first.      By examining how the U.S. and other countries manage their reserve assets today, we can already see the logic for this transition to occur.    Golden empire    Today the U.S. holds 261 million troy ounces (8,133 metric tons) of gold, or about $475 billion worth.      This makes the U.S. the largest holder of gold in the world – by a wide margin – with over two times the amount of the next largest holder (Germany).      Historically there was a very good reason for the U.S. to own gold: The U.S. dollar was pegged to its value. Yet, the U.S. broke with the gold standard in 1971, ushering in the fiat currency age that has existed ever since.      So why exactly do the U.S. and other countries continue to own all this gold?      Here are some of the reasons provided directly from central bankers themselves:    Gold is the de facto safe-haven asset. It is an insurance policy against any major economic, monetary or geopolitical shifts. Given gold’s ample liquidity and universal appeal, countries can easily liquidate it for other assets in turbulent times  Gold is both independent of any given country’s economic or monetary policies while also having a fixed supply (on Earth) with relatively stable supply growth, making it an ideal hedge against both monetary inflation and fluctuations in other reserve assets  Gold is viewed as “nobody’s liability”: It cannot be frozen (in a bank account) or defaulted on when frictions between countries arise.    Combine these reasons with the cultural importance of gold, and it’s uncontroversial to say that having more gold than everyone else is a very good thing.    Fort Knox 2.0    Bitcoin’s similarities to gold are well documented, earning it the appropriate nickname of “digital gold.”      Yet, while bitcoin shares many similarities with gold, including scarcity, stable supply inflation, fungibility and durability, it also makes major improvements over gold in some key areas:    When gold is in high demand, miners are incentivized to dig up more of it, increasing its supply. Bitcoin’s supply does not change in the face of demand, making it less inflationary and more predictable.  It’s far easier (and cheaper) to verify the authenticity of bitcoin than gold.  Bitcoin is much easier to transfer than gold and costs much less to store securely.  Bitcoin is easily divided, whereas gold is not.    For these reasons, a rapidly increasing number of people, companies and institutional investors agree that having more bitcoin than everyone else is a very good thing.      Today this includes the world’s richest man, highly conservative, long-term thinking asset managers, industry leading companies and the most prominent macro investors in the world.      Tomorrow it will include countries, too.    Sovereign techno-economic games    So far, countries and their central banks have resisted (publicly) making or disclosing investments in bitcoin.      In fact, they’ve done the opposite in some cases. European Central Bank head Christine Lagarde was quoted saying it’s “very unlikely” central banks would make the move into bitcoin in the near future. Nigeria’s central bank recently reiterated its outright ban of cryptocurrency. India’s Parliament proposed its own crypto ban, despite the country’s Supreme Court ruling it lawful.      See also: Garrick Hileman - Governments Will Start to Hodl Bitcoin in 2021      These negative actions have occurred in the name of protecting the existing fiat currency regime (e.g., Nigeria) or limiting competition for planned central bank digital currencies (e.g., India).      But there is near certainty that this dynamic will ultimately reverse, potentially within the next 12 months.      Why? Simple economic incentives.      In the near term, there exists an irresistible arbitrage opportunity for a country silently to accumulate a bitcoin position and later announce its holdings. Bitcoin being adopted as a sovereign reserve asset is often considered the “final boss” of adoption milestones. It finally happening would send an ultra-bullish signal and vaporize doubts among traditional investor holdouts, including other central banks.      The resulting adoption acceleration would bestow huge windfalls for early adopter countries who managed to accumulate early in this transition.    The outcomes of these sovereign techno-economic games determine the fate of empires.    In the longer term, bitcoin represents a sovereign wealth-building opportunity with asymmetric risk/reward upside.      Let’s assume a country agrees and decides to buy a relatively small hedge position in bitcoin: 1-5% of its reserves. The upsides are clear, but what’s the downside for being wrong? If it turns out that bitcoin never becomes a global reserve asset, the nation is simply stuck with owning a rapidly growing, highly liquid, alternative asset that behaves a lot like gold.      But what if it doesn't buy any bitcoin and it does become a global reserve asset? Any late adopter country would see its sovereign wealth diminished relative to early adopters and would be forced to capitulate at higher prices later.      Yet, for the U.S., the downside of not being one of the winners of bitcoin is greater than just about anyone else.    Another great race    The U.S. is well-known for using the global financial system – and the U.S. dollar’s status as the global reserve currency – to project its power and punish its adversaries. It’s no surprise, then, that rivals such Russia and China have built their gold reserves to historical levels at the expense of USD and U.S. Treasurys.      Their overall goals are clear: create alternatives to the current U.S. monetary hegemony.      As bitcoin continues to gain adoption and becomes a global reserve asset, it will be thrust into this great competition between nations.      See also: Alex Treece - The Intangible Reasons Ethereum and Bitcoin Lead      If America’s rivals embrace bitcoin first and take advantage of the reserve asset arbitrage, not only will they secure a once-in-a-generation economic windfall, they will also be in position to damage U.S. foreign policy and strategic interests.      Fortunately, the U.S. can avoid this outcome, if it acts boldly and embraces bitcoin first.      Despite a complete lack of leadership from executive and legislative branches of government so far, corporate America and American investors are currently winning this competition for the U.S.      Much of the world’s bitcoin is custodied in the United States. Many of the iconic companies in the cryptocurrency industry – firms like Coinbase, Gemini, BitGo, NYDIG, Digital Currency Group (CoinDesk's parent company) and others – are all U.S.-based. The vast majority of corporate treasury purchases have been made by U.S. companies.      Whether to maintain its leading position of power and wealth or to prevent adversaries from gaining an economic and geopolitical edge, the right strategic move is very clear: The U.S. should play to win with bitcoin. This includes being one of the first to adopt bitcoin as a reserve asset and doing everything possible to ensure the U.S. continues to be the home for many of the most innovative cryptocurrency companies.      The U.S. has found itself at the crossroads of many consequential technology shifts before: the space race, the atom bomb, the internet and, more recently, the race for general purpose artificial intelligence. The outcomes of these sovereign techno-economic games determine the fate of empires.      For the U.S., it’s a game it is unknowingly leading and can still decisively win.

42405910,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAepLMH,1613571523,First Mover: What's Next After Bitcoin Hits $50K? Another $1K Gain,"Bitcoin's (BTC) momentum carried through overnight, pushing upward to a new all-time high above $51,000 just a day after passing $50,000 for the first time.      ""It's not exactly soaring, as it has with other major technical breakouts, but another 3% gain isn't to be sniffed at,"" Craig Erlam, senior market analyst for the foreign exchange broker OANDA, wrote in an email.      In traditional markets, investors were focused on the recent rise in the U.S. Treasury yields to a 12-month high around 1.3% – taken as a sign that bond traders are growing more concerned about future inflation as the economy makes a fuller recovery. Bond yields sometimes rise when there's a greater chance of inflation because investors want the extra income as compensation for the extra risk.      It's also a key focus for cryptocurrency traders because bitcoin has become a popular way for many big investors to bet on faster inflation and a reduction in the U.S. dollar's purchasing power.      A fresh concern this week is that the winter storm hitting the (usually warm) state of Texas might drive up gasoline prices, contributing to inflation. Crude oil held at over $60 a barrel, near highs not seen in more than a year.    Some investors also see the potential for a growing supply of U.S. Treasury bondshttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/treasury-yields-punch-higher-catch-022330178.html, given President Joe Biden's push for a $1.9 trillion stimulus plan, which would likely have to be financed through extra borrowing. Theoretically, an increase in the supply of bonds causes yields to rise, since more investors have to be enticed to buy the securities.    All things being equal, rising yields, while potentially a sign of heightened inflation fears, could make bitcoin incrementally less attractive on a relative basis compared with bonds: ”Momentum funds who bought bitcoin as a hedge against inflation might sell if real yields rise,” Avi Felman, head of trading at BlockTower Capital, told CoinDesk.      On the other hand, a rise in yields might prompt the Federal Reserve to expand its monetary stimulus. The U.S. central bank has been buying $120 billion of bonds a month for most of the past year to help keep interest rates low.    The News    BITCOIN AS A STOCK: As asset managers continue to push for a U.S. exchange-traded fund tied to bitcoin, while prices keep rising, the pressure is growing on the Securities and Exchange Commission to clarify its regulatory stance.    NYDIG, a big digital-asset manager, has filed a new application for a bitcoin ETF, CoinDesk reported Tuesday. (VanEck and Valkyrie also have recently applied.)  So far, the SEC has rejected all applications for bitcoin-based ETFs. In August 2018, it rejected nine such proposals on the same day.  The main question is whether the market has matured enough to meet the requirements listed under the Securities Exchange Act, the federal law that oversees securities trading within the U.S., CoinDesk's Nikhilesh De wrote Tuesday in his ""State of Crypto"" newsletter on policy and regulation.  Another question is what stance Gary Gensler, nominated as SEC chair, will take on the matter – if he even has time to make it a priority. Competing priorities include ""likely having to form a response to the market volatility seen last month with the GameStop stock pump,"" De wrote.  Canadian regulators on Tuesday approved the country's second bitcoin exchange-traded fund. Evolve's bitcoin ETF was conditionally approved to trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange, following approval of Purpose Investment's offering last week. “It’s a promising sign if there are no issues with launching a bitcoin ETF in Canada,"" said James Seyffart, ETF research analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.  “So much work has been done in the backend of this, the plumbing, to effectively allow something like this,"" Purpose Investments CEO Som Seif said Tuesday on CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" show.  Osprey Funds said its bitcoin trust is now available to retail investors via over-the-counter markets, joining a crop of new bitcoin funds aimed squarely at the market-leading Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) before a bitcoin ETF is approved by the SEC. (Grayscale is a CoinDesk sister company.)    TEXAS WINTER STORM HITS CRYPTO: Bitcoin mining farms in Texas go offline as an unusually harsh winter storm and cold spell in the southern U.S. strains the electricity grid.    Market Moves    What comes next now that bitcoin has passed $50K?      The next key milestone for bitcoin would come when the cryptocurrency's market capitalization tops $1 trillion, a threshold that would signal a new level of maturity for the asset. Based on the outstanding number of bitcoins, currently about 18.63 million, that would happen when bitcoin's price clears $53,677.      In the meantime, here's a sampling of commentary from analysts and other observers on what's next for the bitcoin market:    QCP Capital: Options market ""is pricing a 10% chance of $400,000 by year’s end, 15% chance of $300,000, 30% chance of $160,000 and close to a 50/50 chance of higher than $100,000.""  Alessandro Andreotti, bitcoin over-the-counter broker: “In my opinion we are going to keep reaching fresh new highs soon.”  Matt Blom, head of sales and trading, EQUOS: ""If the market remains strong and holds above $50,000, then we see momentum building and the race to a $1T market cap is well and truly on. $54,000 is still the target, and looking ahead, with very little to stop this trend, thoughts of $60,000 will not be far from traders' minds.""  Edward Moya, senior market analyst, OANDA: ""Every day, it seems there are fresh catalysts for bitcoin.""  Denis Vinokourov, head of research at digital assets prime broker Bequant: ""Yesterday's news that MicroStrategy is to buy another round of bitcoin using the proceeds from [its] announced $600 million note offering should be a net-positive for the price action. But there is a risk that, similar to QE announcements, that market participants will be demanding larger and larger ticket sizes or push prices lower."" (EDITOR'S NOTE: MicroStrategy has increased the size of the note offering to $900 million.)  Mati Greenspan, founder, Quantum Economics: ""At this point, people have to be asking just how much longer the party might last? The sheer interest in the space and new money that is reportedly being pumped into bitcoin as a hedge against copious amounts of brrrrrrr from J-POW and the Biden administration could well send bitcoin right past the $50,000 mark and into the stratosphere.""  JPMorgan: Bitcoin’s charge to a record north of $50,000 isn’t sustainable unless the cryptocurrency’s price swings cool down quickly, according to a research note published Tuesday.  Wedbush Securities: “We believe the trend of transactions, bitcoin investments, and blockchain-driven initiatives could surge over the coming years as this bitcoin mania is not a fad in our opinion, but rather the start of a new age on the digital currency front.”  Joel Kruger, cryptocurrency strategist, LMAX Digital: ""Now that we’ve finally pushed through this next great barrier, we recommend exercising extreme caution over the short-term. The market has gone parabolic since breaking through $20,000, and technical studies are warning of the need for a healthy pullback in the days and weeks ahead to allow for severely stretched readings to unwind and normalize.""  James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis: “I just think for Fed policy it’s going to be a dollar economy as far as the eye can see – a dollar global economy really as far as the eye can see – and whether the gold price goes up or down, or the bitcoin price goes up or down, doesn’t really affect that.""  Eric Demuth, CEO, Bitpanda: ""In my opinion, it is just a matter of time until bitcoin becomes the new gold and will be added to the balance sheet of central banks.""  Bitcoin Watch    Weak spot-market volume might be cause for concern      Another day, another record high for bitcoin. The top cryptocurrency rose above $51,000 early Wednesday, taking the month-to-date gain to 54% amid a wave of institutional adoption.    The options market is biased bullish, with both short-term and long-term call options drawing higher prices than puts or bearish bets, CoinDesk's Omkar Godbole writes.  The only cause for concern is the weak spot market volume on institution-focused exchanges such as Coinbase Pro. As seen in the chart above, the 10-day average of daily trading volume is trending south, putting a question mark on the sustainability of the breakout above $50,000.  As such, a sudden pullback, possibly to the 10-day average of bitcoin's price, currently at $47,700, cannot be ruled out.    ALSO:    Pricing in futures market looks bullish, with the March contract on Chicago-based CME trading at 2.57% above the spot bitcoin price, representing an annualized premium of 24%, well above the average around 15%, the Norwegian cryptocurrency-analysis firm Arcane Research noted Tuesday in a weekly report. ""The market is heavily tilted towards the upside, which can trigger brutal liquidations as we advance,"" the analysts wrote.  Most financial executives, including CFOs, are not planning to invest in bitcoin as a corporate asset this year, according to a new survey by consultant Gartner. Eighty-four percent of polled executives (representing 77 firms) told Gartner in February they were spooked by ""financial risk due to volatility of Bitcoin"" when considering whether to invest in the crypto.  Token Watch    Ether (ETH): Customers of the Coinbase cryptocurrency exchange can now sign up to stake ether into the Beacon Chain smart contract, which was set up to help facilitate the Ethereum blockchain's planned ""2.0"" transition to a ""proof-of-stake"" system from the current ""proof-of-work"" system, which is what the Bitcoin blockchain uses.      Dogecoin (DOGE):    The Shiba Inu-themed token started off as a joke cryptocurrency but now has a market capitalization of $7 billion and a huge global following. How did it all happen? CoinDesk's Ollie Leach explains.  ""DOGE is indeed relatively concentrated,"" the blockchain analytics firm Coin Metrics wrote Tuesday in a report. ""The top 100 largest DOGE addresses hold 68.1% of total supply. Comparatively, the top 100 largest BTC addresses only hold 13.7% of total supply.""",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/17/first-mover-whats-next-after-bitcoin-hits-50k-another-1k-gain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/76e254744201f4ba4df60f42fb9b36c2bdd22153-1201x858.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Those shares in the largest crypto exchange in the U.S. are changing hands on the Nasdaq Private Market at $303 a piece, according to two people with knowledge of the auction. That implies a total company value of about $77 billion – greater than Intercontinental Exchange Inc., the owner of the New York Stock Exchange.      “The third weekly transaction closed on Friday and the clearing price was $303 a share,” said a source. “The first week it was 200 bucks a share, the second week it was $301 a share, and the third week it was $303 a share. So you can kind of see price discovery happening.”      Coinbase declined to comment.    Read more: Coinbase to Become Publicly Traded, Announces Proposed Direct Listing of Shares    The Coinbase private market is running an anonymous order book ahead of the company’s direct public listing, a date for which is still unknown. The sale allows current and former employees, as well as investors in Coinbase, to take some cash off the table. Around 254 million shares in Coinbase will be outstanding and available to trade when the firm goes public, according to sources with knowledge of the offering.      Coinbase pre-IPO futures contracts were trading on crypto derivatives exchange FTX at about $386 at the time of writing.    Coinbase goes big    Hopes for Coinbase’s public listing are riding high within the crypto community, especially as the price of bitcoin continues to reach above $50,000. (More will be revealed about Coinbase’s finances when the confidential S-1 it filed with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is made public in the coming weeks.)      Countering such great expectations is the argument that the valuation of 100% of a company could be very different than the valuation of half a percent of its shares.      However, the secondary selling of shares sponsored by Coinbase over the past three weeks has seen “meaningful amounts” change hands, according to a source.      “It’s not like a handful of shares being exchanged at $300 a share.

At launch, the fund’s top holdings include tokens backing an Ethereum-based lending protocol and a decentralized exchange – AAVE and UNI – which each carry an initial weighting of around 25%. Lending protocol token MKR and derivatives protocol token SNX come in around 10%.      Also read: What Is DeFi?      Indeed, Ethereum-based tokens comprise all 10 of the Bitwise DeFi Crypto Index Fund’s positions at launch. Ethereum remains the dominant chain for DeFi with $39 billion in total value locked up, according to DeFi Pulse, despite sky-high transaction fees that can cost users $30 a pop.      For comparison, DeFi protocols had around $1.2 billion in total value locked up around one year ago. Aave alone has over $5 billion locked up now, per DeFi Pulse.      “You're seeing the initial flicker of a new technology that could significantly disrupt a lot of what traditional Wall Street makes money on, making it more efficient, more open, more accessible and more functional. And we're at the early stages of that,” Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan told CoinDesk.      The fund's long-Ethereum-based protocol weighting is a function of the Ethereum blockchain's dominance in the DeFi space, Hougan said.      See also: Bitwise’s Crypto Index Fund Becomes Available to US Investors      The fund, which also includes COMP, UMA, YFI, ZRX and LRC, is the first such offering for accredited investors, according to Hougan. Its assets will be securely stored by California-headquartered Anchorage.      According to Hougan, the fund will be guided by Bitwise’s public methodology, as well as a five-member advisory council representing a broad swath of venture funds active in DeFi.

""Shadow economy"" participants, those who use deal mostly in hard cash, are unlikely to be drawn to using a CBDC, which may make it harder to stay anonymous, Dolan argues in his column for the news agency.      Dolan suggests that even bitcoin cannot guarantee completely anonymity as coins can be traced from wallet to wallet, so it is unlikely that ""legal tender tokens"" could be relied on either.      The ""shadow economy,"" as described by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), is an ecosystem of consumers and business owners who rely mostly on cash to avoid taxation and regulatory oversight.

42405912,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAepLNG,1613565000,Valid Points: How CME Ether Futures Work and Why They Matter,"Trading in ether futures went live on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) late last Sunday with the February contract registering an opening price of $1,669.75.      In less than two weeks, the open price of the February contract has jumped 5% to $1747.75 as ether spot prices have continued to climb upwards of $1,700.      In terms of weekly trading volume, CME ether futures contracts surpassed $160 million in its first full week of trading.      According to Tim McCourt, Global Head of Equity Index and Alternative Investment Product at CME Group, the initial activity of the CME’s market for ether futures is promising but there’s still a long way to go before the product is fully established and mature enough to support other derivatives products such as options.      “We’ve done a really good job the first few days but obviously we want to see more in terms of on-screen liquidity. Right now, about five out of the eight maturities have an active market. So we want to continue to round out that term structure. … We have some work to do in terms of continuing to onboard clearing members and customers. So ether futures will certainly keep us busy for a while,” said McCourt in an interview with CoinDesk.    Ether futures aren’t new    The CME Group isn’t the first to launch an ether futures product. In 2018, digital asset trading service Crypto Facilities based in the U.K.announced the launch of its ether futures product. Last year, U.S.-based crypto derivatives platform ErisX announced the same.      What is significant about the launch of CME ether futures is that it is the first financially settled ether futures product that is also regulated in the U.S., meaning expiry of any futures contracts don’t warrant the transfer of 50 ETH to a U.S. buyer but rather an equivalent amount in dollars. Being financially settled, according to McCourt, is a feature that was in high demand from the CME’s customers.      “Certainly when you’re looking at financially settled futures contracts, you have the ability to avoid some of the barrier to entry around wallets [and] custody of the assets,” said McCourt in an interview with CoinDesk. “Some of the institutional clients would need different types of insurance of the [crypto] assets if they do sort out their custody solution so financially settled just makes it easier for a lot of people.”      A financially settled ether futures product relies heavily on a robust and reliable reference rate for price while also removing and abstracting away the need for interactions with Ethereum, the underlying technology behind ether.      The only impact the Ethereum blockchain could have on CME ether futures products is if its issuance schedule and technical upgrades like Eth 2.0 were to somehow impact its listing on the five major exchanges that CF Benchmarks pulls data from in order for CME to calculate its ether-dollar reference rate. (More information on the CME CF ETH-USD Reference Rate here.)      But just as Ethereum 2.0 is crucial for the technical development of Ethereum, a U.S.-regulated and financially settled ether futures market is a crucial component for the market development of ether.    Why CME ether futures matter    The launch of ether futures on the CME, the world’s largest derivatives exchange platform, is the key to bringing new institutional players to market, according to James Putra, VP of Product Strategy at TradeStation Crypto. TradeStation Crypto’s sister company, TradeStation Securities, recently began offering its clients the ability to trade CME ether futures contracts on its platform.      “There’s a lot of firms that want crypto exposure but just can’t get access to [the spot market]. So they need to interact with futures,” said Putra in an interview with CoinDesk.      Futures contracts enable the ability for traders and investors of an underlying asset to hedge against future price movements. They are also an important tool in the hands of market participants for price discovery.      “Futures give you a long-short optionality so you don’t only have to bet one side,” said Putra. “[In the spot market,] you’re pretty much limited to long only. You can just buy and hold.”      Finally, futures are a critical step in the maturation of markets that pave the way for other sophisticated products and tools for investors to leverage. Tim McCourt, Global Head of Equity Index and Alternative Investment Product at CME Group, said:      “It is critical that the futures market take root [first] and develop that robustness such that it can support [ether] options overlaid on top of the futures.”      McCourt added that the upwelling of interest and demand for an ether futures product, in his view, mirrors increasing interest in what’s being built on Ethereum, pointing to innovations and ongoing projects such as Ethereum 2.0, decentralized finance (DeFi) and stablecoins.      “Interest in [CME ether] products also follows in a congruent manner to the interest in the network that has been growing in the past year,” said McCourt.    The promise of Ethereum 2.0    On Ethereum 2.0 specifically, McCourt affirmed the benefits to scalability and energy efficiency that this new proof-of-stake network could achieve. However, like the ether futures market, he also mentioned that it would take time to see if the promise of Eth 2.0 truly comes to fruition.      Now 11 weeks into its launch, Ethereum 2.0 is secured by over 90,000 active validators each staking 32 ETH, worth roughly $55,600 at time of writing. This represents about 2.7% of the total ETH supply locked in Ethereum’s proof-of-stake network.      On average, Eth 2.0 validators are earning 0.007554 ETH/day or $13.08/day. In total, validator rewards only make up roughly 2.6% of the rewards that Ethereum miners earn daily.

The government is likely to impose personal income tax (IT) and the goods and services tax (GST) on gains from trading cryptocurrencies and from platform fees, respectively, according to a Wednesday report from Business Standard, one of the largest English-language newspapers in India.      ""Bitcoin will be categorized as financial services attracting 18% GST on fee commission collected [by exchanges] under this segment. Plus, [income tax] to be paid on the earnings from this,"" a senior finance ministry official familiar with the matter said. They added that an official circular will be released soon.      According to the newspaper's sources, authorities aim to collect both taxes for the fiscal year April 2020 to March 2021.      The news, if confirmed, is the first clarification on how the cryptocurrency industry and its users will be taxed, albeit probably briefly.      The government is also planning to introduce a cryptocurrency bill in the ongoing session of Parliament, seeking a ban on ""private cryptocurrencies,"" as well as the formal start of development of a digital rupee to be issued by the central bank. The bill's contents are still unknown, and the government is yet to define the term ""private cryptocurrencies.""

In an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, James Bullard said the Fed's policy focus will remain fixed on a global dollar economy ""as far as the eye could see.""      ""Whether the gold price goes up or down or the bitcoin price goes up or down doesn’t really affect that,"" said Bullard.      Instead, the Fed president flagged ""privately issued"" cryptocurrencies not sanctioned by the government as being the primary issue. Bullard then drew comparisons to a time in U.S. history before the Civil War when banks issued their own notes.      ""They were all trading around and they traded at different discounts to each other and people did not like it at all,"" said Bullard. “I think the same thing would occur with bitcoin here.""      Specifically, Bullard's concerns centered around a scenario where currencies could become ""non-uniform"" envisioning a situation where users would walk into a Starbucks paying in either bitcoin, ether or the U.S. dollar.      ""That isn’t how we do this. We have a uniform currency that came in at the Civil War time,” said Bullard.      The St Louis Fed chief also noted investors are looking for a safe-haven asset amid a ""currency competition"" as they had done for centuries, likening bitcoin to gold.      See also: Bitcoin Unlikely to Replace US Dollar as Global Reserve: Marc Chandler      “It’d be very hard to get a private currency that’s really more like gold to play that role so I don’t think we’re going to see any changes in the future,” said Bullard.

42405897,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAepLDQ,1613550705,"Bitcoin Hits New High Above $51K, Shrugging Off Rising Bond Yields","Bitcoin's dizzying bull run is showing no signs of slowing down despite an uptick in U.S. government bond yields.      The cryptocurrency market leader set a new lifetime high of $51,348 early Wednesday, having penetrated the psychological level of $50,000 on Tuesday for the first time, according to CoinDesk 20 data. Prices have risen by 53% this month alone.      The latest move higher comes on the heels of an announcement by publicly listed company MicroStrategy that it plans to boost its bitcoin stash yet again. The firm announced a $600 million debt sale on Tuesday, which will fund the additional purchases. The business intelligence firm has been buying bitcoin since August 2020 and is sitting on a profit of more than $2 billion on its holdings.      According to Avi Felman, head of trading at BlockTower Capital, MicroStrategy's announcement may have been timed to force a break above the critical level of $50,000. The firm made a similar announcement on Dec. 7, following which bitcoin crossed above the then major hurdle of $20,000.      It remains to be seen if the latest move above $50,000 is sustainable, given that U.S. bond yields are rising and pushing gold lower. Bitcoin is widely considered a hedge against inflation like gold.      The yield on the 10-year Treasury note clocked a 12-month high of 1.33% early today and has risen by over 20 basis points this year. Gold is currently trading at a two-week low of $1,790 per ounce. Bitcoin, however, is showing resilience and may come under pressure if and when real or inflation-adjusted yields rise.      As of Tuesday, the 10-year bond was yielding -1% in inflation-adjusted terms, according to data provided by the U.S. Department of the Treasury.      '""Momentum funds who bought bitcoin as a hedge against inflation might sell if real yields rise,"" Felman told CoinDesk.      Also read: Tesla’s Bitcoin Buy May Lead to Widespread Corporate Adoption      Perceived store-of-value assets typically move in the opposite direction to real bond yields. For instance, gold rallied more than $600 to a record price of $2,075 in the five months to August, as the U.S. 10-year real yield fell from 0.55% to -1.08%. Bitcoin has charted a staggering rally over the past 11 months alongside a continued drop in yields.      However, yield rises may be limited, with the Federal Reserve running an open-ended bond purchasing program and inflation likely to get a lift from rising oil prices.

42405899,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAepLCR,1613520000,Kakao to Record Private Securities on Its Own Blockchain as NFTs,"South Korean internet giant Kakao’s blockchain arm Ground X is now storing and verifying unlisted investments as nonfungible tokens (NFTs) on its public blockchain.      Unlisted investments are shares of startups that are offered to investors for purchase prior to a public offering. Since these securities are not listed on formal markets, they are traded over the counter (OTC).      South Korea’s OTC trading market is growing: the country’s OTC exchange K-OTC ended 2020 with a record-high market capitalization of over 1 trillion won ($1.1 billion) since its launch in 2014. Foreign investors can also buy and trade OTC shares in South Korea. In 2018, South Korea amended its tax laws to exempt foreign investors from capital gains taxes on transfers of both listed and unlisted stocks.      Ground X has partnered with local equity management and trading platforms like QuotaBook and Angel League that offer investors the opportunity to buy shares of promising unlisted startups or record and store ownership information.      According to an emailed press release, information about unlisted shares, including face value, number of shares and the shareholder’s name will be recorded on Klaytn, the blockchain developed by Ground X.      The record of the share is then minted as an NFT and offered to shareholders as a digital card through the digital wallet Klip, which is embedded in South Korea’s popular messaging app KakaoTalk. KakaoTalk serves around 50 million users worldwide, and Klip is available to all KakaoTalk users.      Unlisted shares are typically available to investors through internal connections at the firm offering them, but they can also be bought via dealers that make the securities available for sale. According to Inés Chun, communications manager at Ground X, Angel League is open to anybody interested in investing in unlisted companies that are offered on the platform which are managed by experienced investors.      On the contrary, investors cannot buy unlisted shares on QuotaBook, Chun said.      “Many startups in their pre-IPO stage here in Korea use QuotaBook, and the shareholders of such startups can mint their unlisted investments information as NFT cards. Or let’s say, you have unlisted shares of some startup and that company now chooses to use QuotaBook, then you can also have your NFT,” Chun told CoinDesk via an email.      In South Korea, people who buy unlisted shares can send or sell those shares to somebody else, but not through either QuotaBook or Angel League, Chun said. If shareholders want to sell a share bought on Angel League, they have to do so on the platform, he added.      “For Angel League, specifically, you can buy shares that Angel League only offers. But let’s say you’re interested in some shares that Angel League doesn’t offer, then maybe you’d have to look for some other platform,” Chun said.      According to GrowthFunders, a U.K.-based platform that offers investors the chance to buy into unlisted companies, since these shares are not listed on an open market, they are highly illiquid. This means they cannot be easily sold until a company goes public, after which the shares may be diluted.      In March 2019, Ground X raised $90 million through a private coin offering, followed shortly by the launch of the Klaytn blockchain in June of the same year. In late 2019, Binance joined Klaytn’s 24-company governance council. In November 2020, MakerDAO also joined the council.      The launch of the Klip wallet, which was scheduled for late 2019, was delayed.
