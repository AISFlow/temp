42398757,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgXa3,1445294736,Rogue Silk Road Agent Carl Force Jailed for 78 Months,"UPDATE (20th October 03:05 BST): This piece has been updated with additional information about the case and a correction to a quote attributed to Judge Richard Seeborg.      Corrupt federal agent Carl Force IV has been sentenced to 78 months, or six and a half years, in federal prison.  The sentence is less than the 87-month sentence the US government had requested for the former Drug Enforcement Agency agent.  Force was part of a Baltimore, Maryland-based federal task force investigating the online dark market Silk Road. As part of the task force he worked undercover on the Silk Road under the alias ""Nob"", developing a relationship with Silk Road operator Ross Ulbricht.  Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison in May, though the details of Force's crimes were kept under wraps until after the sentence had been handed down.  Force was indicted earlier this year with extortion, obstruction of justice and money laundering, accused of stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars in bitcoin during the investigation and, at one point, selling information about the US government's investigation. He pled guilty in July.  The defense, according to recent court documents, had sought leniency for Force, citing the work environment and personal mental health problems experienced during the period in which he committed the crimes. The defense asked for a four-year sentence during today's hearing, according to Ars Techina.  US District Judge Richard Seeborg said that Force's ""betrayal of public trust is quite simply breathtaking"", Ars reported.  ""It is compounded by the fact that it appears to have been motivated by greed and thrill seeking, including the pursuit of a book and movie deal,"" he continued.  According to Motherboard'sSarah Jeong, Seeborg remarked that Force ""was the master of his fate in this whole disgraceful episode"".  Notably, Force has been ordered to pay $3,000 in restitution to former Silk Road employee Curtis Green, as well as $337,000 to a party identified as ""RP"".  Another federal official, former Secret Service agent Shaun Bridges, was charged with money laundering and obstruction of justice, and later plead guilty to stealing more than $800,000 in bitcoin. Bridges' sentencing hearing is set for December.

42398754,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgXX6,1445291898,Adam Draper: Investors Don't Want to Hear the Word Bitcoin,"On the phone from his San Mateo office, Adam Draper, CEO of Boost VC and son of Skype and Tesla investor Tim Draper, is his usual energetic self, his voice evoking the same optimism as the orange high-tops he wears regardless of occasion.  Draper is fresh off demoing a new batch of startups – Tribe 6 – for the incubator he co-founded with former Xpert Financial collaborator Brayton Williams in 2012, and that in 2013 found success by backing an emerging financial technology called bitcoin, then best known for its volatile price and associations with cybercrime.  While potentially risky, the decision proved adept, winning Boost VC a slew of media coverage and its 2014 pledge to fund 100 ""bitcoin companies"" through 2017. So far, Boost is halfway there, having invested in 52 industry startups, including firms such as Align Commerce, Mirror and Reveal.  Today, however, he's in the middle of recapping a recent trip to New York, unpacking his feelings about a revelation that financial institutions and investors ""don't like bitcoin"", but are interested in ""blockchain"", the amorphous term that while technically referring to bitcoin's distributed ledger, the blockchain, and derivatives that use its logic, has come to serve as a general stand-in for innovation in the way that YOLO was once used to punctuate hip conversations.  Draper told CoinDesk:  ""We use the word blockchain now. I say bitcoin, and they think that's the worst thing ever. It just feels like they put up a guard. Then, I switch to blockchain and they're very attentive and they're very interested.""  Draper seems ambivalent to the change, though he said he was initially against using it, mostly because he believes it's superficial. After all, companies that use the blockchain as a payments rail, the argument goes, still need to interface with its digital currency, which is the mechanism for transactions on the bitcoin blockchain.  ""When we talk about blockchain, I mean bitcoin,"" Draper clarifies. ""Bitcoin and the blockchain are so interspersed together, the incentive structure of blockchain is bitcoin.""  Draper believes it's mostly a ""vernacular change"", noting the ecosystem has been through several such transitions before. He rifles off the list of terms that have come and gone including cryptocurrency, digital currency and altcoin.  ""It's moved from bitcoin to blockchain, which makes sense, it's the underlying tech of all these things,"" he added. ""I think in a lot of ways blockchain is FinTech, so it will become FinTech.""  Effect on Boost  In regards to the startups Boost VC is accepting, Draper said this colloquial change hasn't influenced the businesses that are applying or the ones that gain entrance.  Boost VC's most recent class included only five bitcoin startups – CoinUT, Epiphyte, Joystream, Unocoin and Wealthcoin, down from more than 20 in Tribe 5.  ""All of them, in some way, are using the blockchain, some of them are still using bitcoin,"" Draper explained. ""A lot of them are using bitcoin as a way to get money from one place to another.""  In terms of the guidance startups receive, Draper says the shift to blockchain hasn't resulted in any change in strategy, even on aspects of branding and positioning for growth.  ""It's really about what problem are you really solving and using this tool that we have that is the blockchain, and bitcoin on top of the blockchain, to solve problems that were once impossible to solve,"" he said.  Regulatory burden  As for the low number of bitcoin companies in the most recent round, Draper attributed this to Boost VC's excitement about virtual reality (VR) and to factors like regulation.  In the future, he said, he wants the incubator's batches to be composed evenly of enterprises focusing on each emerging technology, but acknowledged that heightened regulatory burdens in the US are posing an issue.  Draper has been openly critical of the BitLicense, New York's licensing regime for industry businesses, and of the approach lawmakers have taken toward the technology. Also of note is that Boost VC had backed Sand Hill Exchange, a platform shut down by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2015 for acting as an unregistered securities exchange.  This regulatory pressure, Draper said, has put an onus on his team to start conversations about compliance earlier when seeking to enlist new candidates, though he said the shift in how the industry is described could alleviate issues here.  ""Currency does need to be regulated, and this can tie into the blockchain vernacular. The blockchain doesn't need to be, it can be about assets,"" he said, adding:  ""Everyone is moving toward blockchain because you don't need to bear that regulatory burden.""  Blockchain building  When asked about the state of the blockchain infrastructure and its ability to serve as infrastructure for top-layer applications, Draper said he believes enough of the regulatory burden is already being shouldered for new businesses to flourish.  Noting firms in his Boost VC and personal portfolio that meet this definition, he said cited BitPagos, Coinbase, Unocoin and Volabit as examples of companies that could now be built on by other entrepreneurs.  On the subject of private blockchains, Draper was less positive, referring to the technology as a ""private database"", and stating that he believes ""bitcoin's blockchain is the blockchain.""  He noted the launch of Liquid, a new sidechain developed by industry startup Blockstream as proof that the bitcoin blockchain is versatile enough to meet the demands of institutions that want to develop private blockchain networks, while still gaining access to the security and network effect of the bitcoin blockchain.  ""I'm all in on bitcoin's blockchain and still 100% positive,"" he said.  Changing times  The most beneficial change that may come from the rebranding of industry activities under the term ""blockchain"", Draper believes, is that financial institutions have the scale to market the technology to their already large number of users.  ""Financial institutions will build products that people actually use to do all their transactions, and they have the marketing dollars to do that,"" he said. ""In some ways, we're getting hamstrung by now being able to market to as large a market as we'd like.""  Still, he suggested that both Silicon Valley, the central hub of FinTech, and New York, the mecca of old finance, will likely be a bit awkward in their attempts to work together for some time.  Draper recalled a meeting with representatives from the banking community on his New York trip, in which he stood out for fashion choices that had nothing to do with his preference for orange footwear.  ""I was in the middle of these bankers, and I was wearing my orange shoes. Everything else was really nice, suit, tie, everything else, and everyone was making fun of me because I was the only one wearing a tie,"" he said adding:  ""I was like what's happened to New York?""

42398766,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgXiu,1445279473,European Court of Justice Set for Bitcoin VAT Decision,"A long-awaited court decision on whether bitcoin exchanges in Europe will be required to pay value-added tax (VAT) on trades is set to be handed down on Thursday.  The decision will mark the conclusion of a journey that began with a dispute over whether services that buy and sell bitcoins should be charged VAT. The inquiries were prompted after David Hedqvist, a resident of Sweden, asked for a policy clarification on how bitcoin should be taxed as he prepared to open a bitcoin brokerage.  A Swedish court later found that such activities should be exempt from VAT – a decision disputed by the Skatterverket, the country's tax authority. Ultimately, the European Court of Justice was asked to weigh in.  While the court has yet to make a decision, early indications suggest the court may rule in favor of an exemption. In July, Court Advocate General Juliane Kokott recommended bitcoin exchanges be exempt from the VAT requirement. At the time, industry stakeholders and members of the wider community cheered the move.  According to some observers, the decision could extend beyond the specific questions before it, potentially impacting Europe's bitcoin users and industry stakeholders.  “In order to answer the question regarding exchange services, the ECJ might reason that it first needs to assess what such an exchange is actually doing and how the underlying assets should be qualified,” tax attorney Roger Van de Berg of Baker & McKenzie told Bitcoin Magazine in a recent interview.  “As such, it might also investigate the VAT treatment of virtual currencies and thus decide whether or not bitcoin itself is subject to VAT,"" he continued. ""If that happens, we have a clear answer from the ECJ of where bitcoin stands for VAT purposes within the EU.""

42398742,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgUX9,1445274048,Coinprism Launches Open Source Distributed Ledger,"Blockchain technology company Coinprism has released Openchain, an open source, distributed permissioned ledger that targets enterprise and financial institutions.  Unlike bitcoin, which is based on a unique distributed ledger, Openchainhttps://www.openchain.org/ will enable users to deploy their own version of the chain, allowing them to potentially cut costs and reduce settlement time.  Speaking about Openchain's launch, Flavien Charlon, founder and CEO of Coinprism, explained:  ""Traditionally, settlement of a transaction happens some time after the trade happened. For example, three days for stock trading. With Openchain, it is possible to handle the trade and the settlement as a single operation, reducing both costs and counterparty risks.""  Openchain vs bitcoin  The main difference between Openchain and bitcoin's blockchain, Charlon said, resides in the type of assets that his product is designed to handle.  According to Charlon – previously a software development engineer at Microsoft – bitcoin ""is a very special asset ... built for censorship resistance"".  He added:  ""The entire design of bitcoin comes from that requirement, with proof-of-work being at the core of that design. We certainly appreciate the incredible innovation around proof-of-work and censorship-resistant assets, but when banks talk about blockchain technology, they are really not interested in censorship resistance.""  Similarly to bitcoin's blockchain, Charlon claimed Openchain is both fully transparent and auditable.  ""Anyone can connect to a validating node, and receive a real-time copy of the transactions being validated,"" said the founder, adding: ""Openchain is also secured by digital signatures, which make it impossible to counterfeit a transaction.""  One notable difference with bitcoin, Charlon said, is the way in which Openchain deals with transactions to avoid confirmation delays:  ""Openchain gets rid of blocks, and chains transactions directly to each other, which means you can get instant transaction confirmation.""  Competition  Distributed ledger technology has become increasingly popular in recent months, with various companies such as Digital Asset Holdings – which acquired Hyperledger – emerging in the space.  ItBit also revealed details about its top-secret Bankchain project, a private consensus-based ledger system which also targets financial organisations.  Speaking about its competitors, Charlon said:  ""The first big difference with all those companies is that our product is open source and ready to use today. None of these companies have released anything to date, and most of them (if not all) are making their software proprietary.""  Although he declined to divulge specifics, Charlon said a few companies had already experimented with a private beta of Openchain.  ""The feedback we have received so far is very positive. Unfortunately, I can't share the names of the companies at this time,"" he concluded.

42398747,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgUd3,1445255358,21 Inc Applies for Digital Currency Mining Circuitry Patent,"21 Inc, the best-funded company in bitcoin, has filed a patent application with the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for a form of digital currency mining circuitry.  The USPTO – the agency charged with issuing patents to investors and businesses and registering product and intellectual property trademarks – published the submission on 15th October.  Filed in April last year, the filing lists Matthew Pauker; co-founder and chairman at 21 Inc, Nigel Drego; co-founder and chief architect, Veerbhan Kheterpal; president and co-founder and Daniel Fir; co-founder as inventors of a digital currency mining circuitry.  The filing reads  :  ""The present invention relates to mining of digital currencies such as cryptocurrencies. Mining circuitry and mining operations described herein may be used for any digital medium of exchange such as digital currencies, credits, rewards, or points.  Although published by the USPTO, 21 Inc's application is still pending approval, a process which can take years. The USPTO process also enables the public to oppose patents if they consider the application in question is unjustified.  The startup, which has accumulated $116m in funding to date, launched its first consumer product – a bitcoin computer for developers – to mixed reviews last month.  The publication of 21 Inc's filing comes after the news that Coinbase had submitted patent applications for nine different bitcoin products.  CoinDesk reached out to 21 Inc for comment, but no reply was received by press time.
