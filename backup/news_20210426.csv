42386552,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBTzAX,1619470947,"A Year After Coronavirus Meltdown, Few Investors See Risk of Deflation: Deutsche Bank","Think back to April 2020, when coronavirus-related lockdowns were hitting the global economy hard, and only the most sanguine optimists – and politicians – saw any likelihood of a rapid reopening and rebound.      At that point, the risk of deflation loomed large in the minds of many investors because of the steep drop-off in consumer demand. Prices for bitcoin, (BTC), seen by some cryptocurrency traders as a potential hedge against inflation, stagnated below $10,000, even though central banks around the world were printing trillions of dollars of fresh money.      A year later, the mentality has changed radically: With vaccines rolling out and economists now projecting a buoyant recovery, four in five investors see inflation as far more likely than deflation, according to a new survey by German lender Deutsche Bank.      It's the second month in a row investors have logged such an overwhelming position, and so the idea appears to be sticking. Perhaps not coincidentally, bitcoin prices are now over $50,000.      “A vast majority (81%) agree that inflation is more likely after the pandemic while only 10% thought we would see deflation,” according to Deutsche Bank. The survey was conducted earlier this month and covered about 700 global investors.      Some 43% of investors responded that higher-than-expected inflation and rising bond yields pose the biggest risks to market stability, according to Deutsche Bank.    Most respondents see U.S. inflation averaging above the U.S. Federal Reserve’s long-term target of 2%, but remaining under 3%.  About 61% respondents saw no risk of major market convulsions this year due to any plans by Federal Reserve officials to taper their asset purchases of $120 billion per month.  In 2013, a Federal Reserve-induced “taper tantrum” sent traditional markets into a tizzy.

42386557,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBTzGp,1619469628,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Bounces to $54K as Ether Fees Drop Below Average in Past Week,"The price of bitcoin headed towards bearish territory Sunday before bouncing. Ether’s average fees have dropped over the past seven days, creating a potential trading advantage for some.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $54,076 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 9.2% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $47,272-$54,340 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC above the 10-hour but and 50-hour moving average on the hourly chart, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin jumped Monday, reaching as high as $54,340. It was a powerful reversal after prices fell as low as $47,272 around 23:00 GMT (6 PM ET) Sunday.      The largest cryptocurrency was changing hands around $54,076 as of press time.      Bitcoin’s recovery may spark momentum, according to technical analyst Katie Stockton of the Fairlead Strategies consulting firm.      “The bounce should persist this week,” Stockton wrote in her ""Cryptocurrency Compass"" report on Monday. “But the recent loss of intermediate-term momentum suggests bitcoin will meet resistance below $62,000.""      Based on CoinDesk 20 data, bitcoin has only been able to close above $60,000 on seven days in the entirety of its 12-year existence. All of those have occurred in the past three months.      With the $60,000 price point being a level of “resistance” where some traders might start selling, Stockton sees $40,000 as the price level where investors will start scooping up what they perceive as cheap BTC.      “Support is near $42,000 as a gauge of downside risk within the long-term uptrend,” Stockton noted.      The news cycle is heavily dictating some of the price action in the crypto market, according to Michael Gord, chief executive officer of quantitative firm Global Digital Assets.      “I think we are seeing more regulations around digital assets implemented globally,” Gord said. “This might cause investors to take a more conservative wait-and-see approach and perhaps exit some positions to hedge the risk.”      There are a lot more eyeballs now on crypto. This may make some bitcoin traders more trigger-happy when it comes to the sell button.      In the derivatives market, funding rates had turned negative, generally seen as sign that traders aren’t hungry for long leverage. They are still near zero, according to data aggregator Skew.      Jason Lau, chief operating office of San Francisco-based exchange OKCoin, sees a lasting market recovery and further upside.“With leverage and derivative activity still coming off all-time highs – bitcoin futures open interest has declined over 30% from the peaks – a spot-led recovery might be setting up bitcoin for another leg up,” Lau told CoinDesk.      Read More: JPMorgan to Let Clients Invest in Bitcoin Fund for First Time    Ether fees drop, but at what cost?    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Monday, trading around $2,489 and climbing 9.7% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Over the past three months, the average fee paid on the Ethereum network to conduct transactions was approximately 0.0097 ETH. However, in the past week that average has dropped to 0.0079 ETH. It works out to an 18% reduction in the average cost of using the network, the primary ecosystem for decentralized finance (DeFi), consisting of programmable blockchain applications for trading, lending and derivatives.      Many might welcome this news, as often Ethereum network fees have been so expensive that DeFi applications are unusable and more expensive than centralized or traditional financial platforms.      However, Peter Chan, lead trader at quantitative firm OneBit Quant, says the fee improvement is a result of some traders building “bots,” or automatic systems, working directly with Ethereum miners. They have built a tool called MEV-geth that floods the network with transactions in the amount of 0 ETH in order to spot a preferential transaction sequence.      The dynamic appears to be resulting in an advantage for the traders.      “Basically, some of the bots decided to work with miners and there are immense amounts of zero-gas transactions mined,” Chan told CoinDesk. “The problem is that only whitelisted miners will be able to see these transactions, unlike where everyone can see in mempool.”      The mempool is the list of network transactions waiting to be processed and confirmed by the Ethereum miners.      “This black box creates asymmetric information tilted towards the miners,” Chan added. He suggested that people need to be cautious some more-advanced traders are getting information faster than others as a result of this cooperation with Ethereum miners. The bot uses a proof-of-work consensus mechanism similar to the Bitcoin blockchain’s.      The Ethereum 2.0 network upgrade on the horizon plans to switch from proof-of-work mining, which relies on solving cryptographic puzzles by computers to run, to proof-of-stake, which requires cryptocurrency balances to run.      “The best way to deal with this is to set a tighter slippage to protect your trade, especially if you are trading a niche token,” Chan said.

The sale trimmed Tesla's position by 10%, Tesla CFO Zach Kirkhorn said on an earnings call Monday.      In the slide deck accompanying the company's first-quarter earnings results Monday, Tesla mentioned the sale of some bitcoin:    ""Year over year, positive impacts from volume growth, regulatory credit revenue growth, gross margin improvement driven by further product cost reductions and sale of Bitcoin ($101M positive impact, net of related impairments, in 'Restructuring & Other' line) were mainly offset by a lower ASP, increased SBC, additional supply chain costs, R&D investments and other items. Model S and Model X changeover costs negatively impacted both gross profit as well as R&D expenses.""    Elon Musk's electric vehicle company purchased $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin in February.      Kirkhorn said on the call that Tesla invested in bitcoin to earn yield on its excess cash in a low-interest-rate environment.      While the company continues to deal with global supply chain crunches like semiconductor shortages or ship port capacity, he said the bitcoin market is a liquid market with an optimistic future.      ""There aren't many traditional opportunities to do this, or at least that we found ... particularly with yields being so low and without taking on additional risk or sacrificing liquidity,"" Kirkhorn said, despite bitcoin's perception as a risk asset among most traditional financial analysts.      Telsa will continue to accumulate bitcoin through customer transactions and will make bitcoin-related announcements in the future, Kirkhorn added.

Russian police arrested several people in the city of Nizhny Novgorod on allegations of peddling fake bank notes over the infamous Hydra darknet marketplace, Russian newspaper Kommersant reported Monday.      The alleged criminals managed to sell about one billion rubles (about US$13.3 million) in fake bank notes via online shops on Hydra, according to the outlet's unnamed sources. Chainalysis considers Hydra the single biggest darknet marketplace in the world.      The four people facing charges in a district court – Sergey Arisov, Ivan Aferov, Andrey Skvortsov and Oleg Efimov – reportedly printed bank notes and sold them on Hydra for bitcoin. When a buyer sent a payment, a courier would deliver a package with fake bank notes to a certain location and hide it. Then a courier would share the location with the buyer.      Often the package would be buried in a public park or a suburban forest in Russia, giving this delivery method a nickname translated as “hidden treasure” (“klad” in Russian). According to Kommersant, the police got to the ring organizers after catching several couriers. Police seized computers and other equipment from the ring's headquarters.      The fake bank notes would normally cost 10%-15% of their nominal value for big batches and up to 30% for smaller batches up to 150,000 rubles ($2,000).

They offer bank notes with a nominal value 2,000 or 5,000 rubles, with prices starting at 0.0002 BTC for a bank note. All the shops recommended buyers spray the bank notes with hairspray after purchase to get the “required texture and typical crunchiness."" Names of brands guaranteeing such results were helpfully provided.      According to buyers’ reviews, they would often find the “treasures” easily, and use the fake money to pay for things. In some cases the packages appeared slightly damaged, “stolen by mice” or not found at the designated spot. In one case, the buyer complained some people beat him up and took away the package.

42386540,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBTyxx,1619462556,Blockchain Data May Have Foreshadowed Monday's Bitcoin Price Rally,"Bitcoin was soaring on Monday and, based on an analysis of blockchain data, the price move may have been weeks in the making.      The ""spent output profit ratio"" (SOPR), a blockchain data metric that measures the net profit/loss position of outstanding bitcoin (BTC), had approached levels that typically precede price rallies, according to Glassnode, a cryptocurrency analytics firm.      The SOPR dipped below a reading of 1 last week, precisely the level that typically leads to a reversal of a market drawdown, according to Glassnode.      SOPR is used to predict trend reversals by measuring the realized value of the price of BTC sold versus the original purchase price in dollars.      ""It would be irrational to sell at a loss when gains are imminent,"" according to Glassnode.

42386548,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBTz2z,1619458563,Time Is Running Out to Win the Blockchain Race,"History is full of companies that missed out on big technological changes. Many of them thought they were carefully timing their participation in the market, but I believe they may have been looking at the wrong measures of adoption and consequently made the wrong decisions. That pattern is about to repeat itself with blockchain. The issue here is that when it comes to technology, the battle over standards and market leadership is usually decided before mass adoption.      The result is that by the time most companies notice that the market is entering a mass-adoption phase, it’s too late to change the course of the market. The market for personal computers arguably started in 1977. A decade later, in 1987, less than 15% of all American households had a personal computer, but by then, Microsoft Windows was the market leader with more than half the market. (Great perspective from Asymco.com here and here and here.)    Paul Brody is EY's Global Blockchain leader.    The pattern repeated itself in the smartphone category. Nokia can be said to have kicked off the market with the Symbian ecosystem in 2000. Email-focused smartphones followed in 2003 and then touch-based smartphones in 2007. By 2011, even though adoption was still less than about 20% of the market, we already had the same two market leaders we know today.      The pattern appears to have largely repeated itself in the world of cloud computing and networking systems. Even though both markets are largely based on open-source technologies and well-understood published standards, they remain dominated by the original leaders, even after decades of determined and big spending competition. The market leader in networks has a 50% share, and the market leader in cloud has a 32% share.      And so there is a lesson here for the world of blockchain: Time is running out. That’s true for alternative blockchains, for legacy players, for everyone who isn’t already knee-deep in this business to become a serious player. Depending on the starting point you select (Bitcoin in 2009 or Ethereum in 2015), we are seven to 12 years into this market development. Estimates vary, but the more reliable ones point to between 8% and 10% of all Americans already own some cryptocurrency. The window to create a leadership position seems to close around 10-12 years after a market is created, and so that time is near, if it hasn’t already arrived.    The most astonishing aspect about market leadership in technology is how little it depends on the technology itself.    Just how close we are to the end of the game can be hard to discern in the day-to-day fog of competitive warfare. Between 1985 and 1990, you wouldn't have been in bad company if you had picked up a Commodore Amiga (as I did) or an Atari ST. In the mid-2000s, you were in similarly good company if you eschewed complicated touch screens for the reliability of a smartphone with keys.      Not only would you have been in good company for choosing different smartphones or PCs, you would have also been right in pointing out the enormous flaws in the market leaders. A black and white PC in 1985? Only 640 kilobytes of memory? The same kinds of absurdities can be found in the world of blockchain. The carbon footprint for Bitcoin and the transaction gas fees (the fee required to successfully conduct a transaction on Ethereum) can only be described as obscene.      These problems did not destroy their ecosystems, however. They got fixed, often imperfectly and with much grumbling, and people moved on. When PCs with extended memory arrived, the solution was criticized as a clumsy workaround. People bought them in huge numbers anyway. Expect roughly the same reception to any “solution” to Bitcoin’s carbon footprint.      I believe the dominant players in the world of blockchain are clearly visible now as well. Bitcoin represents a bigger market capitalization than every other blockchain combined and appears to be on track to become the preferred digital store of value. Likewise, Ethereum has more developers than every other blockchain combined, and is similarly on track to becoming the preferred economic infrastructure for the next generation of developers. At the same time, companies like Aave, Binance, Coinbase and Compound Labs are busy staking out the high ground in this ecosystem around specific value propositions.    Read more: Paul Brody: The Future of Everything Is Free    I’ve spent five years at EY doing everything I can to make sure that we don’t just participate in this market, but that we lead it. I don’t think I will know if we succeeded for another decade, but I am sure that the critical time is now, and I find myself struggling at times to communicate to others my intense sense of urgency in a market that many think is just in its infant stages.      If there is one final reason to act with urgency, it’s not just that the window for market leadership is closing. It is also unlikely to reopen. There were better operating systems back in 1987 than the market leaders, and that was also true in 2000, 2010 and 2020.      The most astonishing aspect about market leadership in technology is how little it depends on the technology itself. There is always something better out there. The strength of the platform may have started in the technology, but in the end, it is much more driven by the total investment, the installed base and the developer community.      In the next year or two, you can expect many technology and financial services companies to explain their plans to enter the blockchain market.

42386553,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBTz9H,1619457233,"Plutocracy Is Still Bad, Proposed EOS Overhaul Confirms","I have been writing about EOS, once a top-10 blockchain, now in the top 30, since before the network launched.      By and large, EOS token holders have disliked my reporting. Every time I put out a new post it would get roundly critiqued as ""FUD"" and even occasionally attacked specifically by Block.One founder Brendan Blumer.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    What no one ever did, though, was show where any of my reporting was substantively wrong on the facts. In fact, on occasion members of the community would admit the facts had been correct even if they pointed to an uncomfortable truth.      What did happen, though, was I would put out a report on some facet of EOS that would frustrate its proponents. I would ignore the blockchain for a while, usually until someone in the ecosystem would bring something to my attention. More often than not, I would hear voices that had once decried my past “FUD” now decrying EOS or its creators.      And, in fact, a new proposal from Block.One seems to implicitly acknowledge a number of points made in my past reporting.      The proposal for stake-based voting and rewards on EOS basically follows the model that blockchains like Cosmos and Cardano use and that Ethereum has been working to deploy: sharing block rewards directly with users who stake to support validators (like Bitcoin's miners) on the network.      As of now, EOS holders can stake their EOS to vote for a slate of block producers (BPs, what EOS calls validators). They could vote for as few as one and as many as 30; all their tokens vote equally for all the block producers a voter supports.      Further, voting is basically continuous.      The top 21 block producer candidates automatically share a quarter of the annual inflation (i.e., new supply) of new EOS distributed with each block. Some of the rest went to other block producer candidates who contributed to the network in other ways.      The original plan had also included some inflation for developing the network but it turned out no one really cared about that so it was all burned.      So let's go through the proposal and point out how it squares with concerns raised in my prior reporting. Each of the bolded parts below are straight from the post linked above.    ""Proposal: We are proposing a staking pool system that can directly reward token holders in exchange for their vote (required) and securing the network.""    So this is the key change: Everyone who stakes and votes gets rewarded for doing so.      When EOS kicked off there was this high-minded idea the block producers who did the best work for the network (not just validating, but developing apps and tools) would get the votes to earn the most rewards.      That's not what happened at all, though, and the hardest-working block producers started leaving the network in frustration.      Instead, block producers started paying people for their votes, something Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin had predicted would happen on his blog.      As early EOS supporters left and new ones came into this new regime, the viewpoint on this reality went from being a bit of an embarrassing truth to becoming something Block.One's CEO described as aligning the validators with token holders.      So instead of block producers offering stakers specific deals for backing them, under this new vision the network itself would pay wallets that participate in governance, if the proposal is adopted.    ""Proposal: To reduce this gap we are proposing the removal of bpay rewards and instead propose to distribute all rewards through vpay.""Proposal: To help facilitate a healthy distribution of vpay rewards, all votes must include 21 block producer candidates.""    Under the current system a quarter of inflation goes to the top 21 block producers automatically (the ones who have complete power over network consensus) and the rest gets distributed to pretty much everyone who has users voting for them, pro-rata. Most of that goes to the top 21, too.      So EOS proposes stripping out that automatic carve-out and distributing it all pro rata, assuming the leading BPs will still get the most payout anyway.      This, to me, reads as an acknowledgement that frequently the BPs doing the most work for the network weren't actually the ones in the top 21. The ones earning the most were the BPs backed by whales turning their large holdings into even more EOS.    Proposal: We are proposing that block producers who underperform, or fail to produce blocks at their designated time, will create a penalty effect that decreases the total inflation in the system.    This was the real black mark of the prior system: Many of the BPs just weren't validating blocks. It's kind of crazy when you think about it, but the system aligned them so poorly with the network that blocks would get missed all the time. Check out the data on AlohaEOS' reliability tracker.      One entrepreneur told us he had to completely revise his code strategy for an EOS-based app because he couldn't trust it to do what he needed from block to block.      So under this new approach, the entire system would be punished if blocks are missed. The theory is it will give all voters an incentive to support BPs who won't miss blocks.      Which seems ... obvious.      This is only a proposal, of course, and Block.One doesn't directly have the power to impose it on EOS. However, if it does move through without much difficulty, there's a good chance the network will work much better.      That could be good, but it will illuminate one more issue that has hung over the network from the start.      Most crypto true believers have already thought 21 organizations was much too few for a truly decentralized blockchain. But the progress of this proposal could reveal that the number is smaller still: That really just one organization has the power in EOS, and that's Block.One itself.",NEUTRAL,없음,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/26/plutocracy-is-still-bad-proposed-eos-overhaul-confirms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2b23bd4bb6bb1ee8c27311cd6bad18beeb56733b-2048x1536.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410972,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggttkW,1619451551,DeFi Reshapes the CoinDesk 20,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) and the assets related to it have surged not just in price but in market activity, including listings and volume on some of the more liquid and established centralized exchanges. Volume on some of the largest decentralized exchanges has grown at a time when the activity of these exchanges' and lending services' native tokens has surged on their more centralized counterparts.  This has put them into the catchment of the CoinDesk 20, which ranks the most heavily traded assets in crypto, as measured by dollar volume on trusted exchanges. The top DeFi assets by volume are re-shaping the list from the bottom up.  The latest quarterly update to the list, which went live on Monday, April 26, based on Q1 and Q4 volume data, incorporates seven new assets: aave, filecoin, the graph, nucypher, polkadot, uniswap and YFI (yearn.finance) into the list of the market's 20 volume leaders. Six of the seven are DeFi applications or related services.  Aave is the native token of a decentralized lending service.  Filecoin is the native token of a decentralized data storage application.  The Graph is the native token of a blockchain data service that markets its offering to DeFi projects.  NuCypher is a privacy application, designed to allow users to encrypt data shared via decentralized applications.  Polkadot is a smart contract platform designed to integrate multiple subsidiary blockchains.  Uniswap is the native token of a decentralized exchange and automated market maker.  Yearn.finance is the native token of a decentralized lending service.  Aave, the graph, nucypher, uniswap and yearn.finance are all ERC-20 tokens, running on the Ethereum blockchain. Filecoin and Polkadot run their tokens and their services on their own respective blockchains.  Many of these assets, especially those in the DeFi category, are relatively new additions to the component exchanges used to rank the CoinDesk 20 list. Nonetheless, their volume has grown quickly. Some are entering the list late, excluded previously due to an error in calculations. (See below.)  The seven new assets replace Cardano's ATOM, dai, ethereum classic, kyber network, omg network, orchid and 0x.  The CoinDesk 20 is a list of core digital assets that constitute roughly 99% of the market by volume, not an index. Its methodology uses volume data from eight exchanges, compiled by Nomics. The eight exchanges were selected, vetted and verified by all three of a trio of studies on fake and verifiable volume, published in 2019 and 2020. They are: Bitfinex, bitFlyer, Bitstamp, Coinbase, Gemini, itBit, Kraken and Poloniex. Information on CoinDesk Indexes can be found here.

42386556,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBTzEJ,1619450716,"Self-Sovereign Identity, 5 Years On","It was five years ago today that I wrote The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity for CoinDesk, my foundational article discussing the history of digital identity and laying out principles for creating a new sort of identity, based on individual control and human rights. It was written to address a problem that was growing year by year: Facebook was increasingly controlling our access to the online world, and Google was increasingly correlating all of the information about us. Meanwhile, the refugee crisis in Europe was highlighting the problem that 1.1 billion people in the world were living without digital identity at all, denying them crucial access to financial, political and social systems.    Christopher Allen is Executive Director and Principal Architect of Blockchain Commons a “not-for-profit” social benefit corporation committed to open infrastructure.    How could we square the circle, widening access to digital identity, while making sure it was something that was controlled by us, not by huge megacorps? My answer was self-sovereign identity.      My article was very much written from atop the shoulders of giants. PGP’s Web of Trust was one of the first architectures to show a different way, where identity could be supported by peers rather than by centralized authorities. The Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) had already done a decade worth of lauded design of user-centric identity, including work with OpenID and other emerging standards. Devon Loffreto was one of the first to talk about “sovereign source authority” in Project VRM. I am happy to have contributed to that stream of design, and I have been elated to see support grow for my own self-sovereign identity approaches over the last five years.      I feel like the principles were the most important element of my original article. They were intended as a draft that I thought would need more community input and evolve over time, but instead they resonated immediately. I have been able to talk about them with legislators and civil servants in Taiwan, Holland and Wyoming; they speak to all of those people about the need for human dignity and control of identity on the internet. The 10 principles of self-sovereign identity have become a part of our conversation.      There’s been a bit more resistance over the name of self-sovereign identity. There was always concern that it would get intellectually conflated with the sovereign citizen movement in the United States, to which it has zero relation, but there was also concern whether it would cause unease with governments. Personally, I put the latter concern aside in May 2016 when I attended the ID2020 Summit at the United Nations and heard global ambassadors and leaders perfectly willing to use the new term.      Today, the language of self-sovereignty had spread far beyond its beginnings as a type of identity to users of many sorts of digital assets, such as cryptocurrency. Digital-asset holders speak of it as something that gives them the autonomy to make their own decisions about those assets, without any interference from third parties or other gatekeepers. So, even if there is still some question about the “self-sovereign” nomenclature in the digital-identity ecosystem, it seems to be increasingly accepted by the digital-assets community.      I think Google may actually best point to the success of the term: I remember back in 2016, people interested in my article were told to just search for “self-sovereign” and they could find it at the top of the results, but now it’s a few pages back in the searches! That reflects progress in the field: The search results are now full of articles discussing self-sovereign identity and of companies offering solutions.    Read more: Christopher Allen: The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity (2016)    I think these are the two most crucial successes to mark on this fifth anniversary: that we are all acknowledged to be people on the internet, deserving dignity and holding human rights and that the idea of self-sovereignty has become a part of the vocabulary. It speaks to a change in our view of personhood in the 21st century that I feel is crucial. But, of course, that’s been backed up by an astounding amount of technological innovation during the last five years as well.      I’m proud that a lot of that initial movement came through work on two crucial technologies, Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs), at the Rebooting Web of Trust (RWOT) workshops that I host. The work was done by a huge array of experts, leading off with Drummond Reed, Les Chasen and Manu Sporny. Five years later, VCs are a full Recommendation at W3C as an official international standard, and DIDs are a Candidate Recommendation at W3C and thus almost there. That’s the heart of the self-sovereign identity architecture: an identifier and the ability to make claims.    What does a DID look like? A DID is a digital identifier such as did:example:123 that represents you (or really, any entity) in some context. In a sense, it’s like a Social Security number or driver’s license number, except that it is controlled by you and non-identifying. A link to a DID document can provide authentication information and references to Verifiable Credentials. That allows you to make claims without forcing you to reveal a real-world identity first.  How does a DID work? A user can use a secret (usually a large number) to prove that they own a DID and thus the claims made for that DID through Verifiable Credentials. These Verifiable Credentials might give them electronic privileges, such as access to a website, or they might provide real-world details, such as date of birth, college degrees or work history. Other entities can validate the claims by signing them. The essential point is the identifier is separate from the claims about that identifier, and thus offers better security and privacy.  How do DIDs meet the requirements of self-sovereign identity? DIDs address many of the principles of self-sovereign identity, but particularly control, access and portability. A user has personal authority over their identity, and in fact can create multiple, contextual identities to avoid correlation; a user knows all the data associated with the DID; and a user can use the DID in different contexts as they see fit. That is a big change from something like Facebook Connect, where a third-party could suddenly and arbitrarily remove a user’s access to a variety of websites. DIDs built upon the full set of self-sovereign identity principles can go far beyond that, allowing a user total understanding of the identity they are putting forth and what information it provides to other people.    There are now any number of companies advancing these ideas: Self-sovereign identity is becoming a large industry. There are so many that the best way to talk about them is simply through an overview of the largest communities. A variety of companies are closely aligning to the W3C specs, including members of the W3C-CCG (Credential Community Group) such as Digital Bazaar, which has persistently supported the work of Rebooting the Web of Trust; the Decentralized Identity Foundation is also working on creating a decentralized identity ecosystem, with leadership from Microsoft and Consensys; and the Linux Foundation is working on Hyperledger Indy with companies such as International Business Machines and Evernym. It’s not just a large ecosystem, but a healthy one, with a number of different voices each suggesting different ways forward and with many new voices emerging.      Mind you, I think there’s still room for improvement.    Read more: Jeff Wilser: Self-Sovereign Identity Explained  I have always thought it was premature to tie DIDs too tightly to a methodology, especially to a specific ledger approach. That has become a point of contention as blockchain-based ledger technologies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have been criticized for their transaction costs, energy usage and financial volatility. Fortunately, there’s already work being done to address that, via a rubric for evaluating the decentralization of DID methodshttps://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot9-prague/blob/master/final-documents/decentralization-rubric.pd.    I am also a little unsettled to see so much attention paid to Legally-Enabled Self Sovereign (LESS) Identity, and not nearly enough to Trust Minimized Identity, as I said in a talk just before the pandemic. LESS Identity is focused on high-trust environments with real-world identity verification and is positioned for government acceptance; while Trust Minimized Identity is focused on defending human rights against powerful actors, and so has additional requirements for anonymity and is more likely to be built around peer-to-peer authentication.      It’s somewhat understandable that LESS Identity has received the most attention because it’s what businesses are more likely to need, and it still satisfies crucial self-sovereign principles such as enabling user control and allowing for minimum disclosure. But Trust Minimized Identity was one of our major concerns when we first started talking about self-sovereign identity: Supporting the human rights of refugees, no matter where they are in the world, was one of our first and most crucial use cases, and LESS Identity won’t get us there.      In other words, there’s still a need for Trust Minimized Identity, and we must make sure that we don’t lock it out as an option as we progress on LESS Identity systems. We are doing a bit of trust-minimized work at Blockchain Commons with our did:onion method, but we have had the same trouble prioritizing it that everyone does – money is available for the LESS Identity approaches that are supported by progressive national governments, but not necessarily for trust-minimized solutions needed elsewhere.      Finally, we should remember that though DIDs and VCs may be a foundational architectural requirement to support many of the principles of self-sovereign identity, they are not themselves sufficient. Technology can make it easier to manage electronic identity morally, but in order to ensure that principled foundation, we need to build privacy and the guarantee of human rights atop it, using cryptographic technologies such as blinding, selective disclosure, de-anonymization resistance and zero-knowledge proofs.      This is becoming particularly important today, when we are seeing DIDs and VCs being considered as the basis of vaccine credentials (aka “Immunity Passports”). The use of DID and VC technologies alone does not ensure that vaccine credentials fulfill the principles of self-sovereign identity; careful scrutiny is required to balance the needs of public health with the risks of those credentials being used for other, unintended purposes.      I became involved in the identity field in large part because I believe that identity can be a double-edged sword, usable for both beneficial and maleficent purposes. To remain beneficial to its participants, an identity system must balance transparency, fairness and support of the common good with protection for the individual. Even with the use of DIDs and VCs, we must remain vigilant.      Despite these qualms, I am thrilled by how far self-sovereign identity has come in five years. I’m thrilled to have advocated for the term and to have suggested some principles and that these have found acceptance in our communities. I’m thrilled to have worked with folks from Rebooting the Web of Trust, from IIW, from W3C, from DIF, from Hyperledger Indy, and from any number of companies to advance these foundational ideas into a real industry, and I’m thrilled to see what comes next!",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Christopher Allen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/04/26/self-sovereign-identity-5-years-on,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/33ae795df5a15fabfd9c0ed5ade438bac0f15c6e-1400x930.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The price increase came amid continuing signs of growing adoption of cryptocurrencies. Hours after the bitcoin price started rising early Monday, CoinDesk reported that investment banking giant JPMorgan could soon launch a bitcoin fund for its deep-pocketed clients.      The top cryptocurrency was changing hands at $53,860, per CoinDesk 20 data.      The ascent began early in Asia trading hours when the cryptocurrency reached lows near $48,000 and looked oversold as per the relative strength index – an indicator widely used by traders to assess the price momentum.      JPMorgan could launch an actively managed bitcoin fund for private wealth clients as early as this summer, sources told CoinDesk. The investment bank has yet to confirm its plans to launch a fund dedicated to the top cryptocurrency, which seen a sixfold rally since October 2020.      JPMorgan's bitcoin fund could accelerate institutional adoption. Rivals Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have already announced plans to offer bitcoin exposure to their wealthy clients.      While the cryptocurrency is gaining ground for the first time in six days, the options market continues to show bias for short-term puts, or bearish bets, with the one-week ""put-call"" skew above zero.      Put-call skews measure the cost of puts relative to that of calls, and they’re seen as a gauge of the market’s bias. However, the metric has come off sharply to 6% from highs above 20% seen last week, an indication of reduced bearishness. According to some analysts, it’s a sign the market has bottomed out.      Market chatter shows some investors are skeptical about the sustainability of the price bounce, as the weekly chart MACD histogram, an indicator used to gauge trend strength and trend changes, has crossed below zero, in a sign of a bearish shift in the market sentiment.      Seven of the past ten bear crosses on the weekly MACD histogram led to deeper price declines. As such, the latest developments on the MACD are a cause for concern for the bulls.

42386555,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBTzD3,1619441372,"Polygon Jumps in Crypto Market Rebound, as Ether Congestion Drives Adoption for Rivals","MATIC, the native token of Polygon Network, was gaining the most in a broad-based rally in cryptocurrencies on Monday, as investors look to layer 2 scaling solutions amid continued stress on Ethereum's network.      Messari data shows the MATIC price has risen by 40% in the past 24 hours, hitting 6.5-week highs above $0.50, for a 25-fold gain on a year-to-date basis. Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency, was up 6% over the past 24 hours, while No. 2 ether surged 10%.      MATIC, now with a market capitalization of more than $2.5 billion, rose about 5% in price last week, defying a sell-off in cryptocurrencies as markets digested the prospects of U.S. President Joe Biden's proposed capital gains tax hike. If passed, the measure could dampen demand for riskier investment assets, including bitcoin as well as other fast-moving digital assets.      Polygon's organic growth is powering its price higher, Alex Svanevik, CEO of blockchain data company Nansen, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.      ""Polygon has seen 10x rise in the number of transactions since the start of the year,"" Svanevik said. ""That's a significant increase.""    Polygon getting more traction    Record activity on Ethereum has led to network congestion and high transaction costs this year. The dynamic in turn has driven an increase in demand for alternative ""smart-contact"" blockchain networks, such as Binance Smart Chain (BSC), along with scaling projects like Polygon that provide faster and cheaper transactions using layer 2 sidechains. These are tangential networks running alongside the main Ethereum blockchain.      In recent weeks, Polygon has won increasing adoption, with top names from the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) announcing integration with the layer 2 scaling solution in a bid to bypass congestion and high fees on Ethereum's network.      ""Polygon, the top Ethereum layer 2 is going nuts! Integrations with Aave, Pooltogether, Sushiswap, Open Sea, Curve Finance, Decentraland, and loads of other big #defi applications,"" market analyst Lark Davis tweeted Sunday.      The Aave-Polygon integration announced March 31 has already brought over $1 billion in liquidity into Aave protocol, according to a tweet from Polygon co-founder Mihailo Bjelic. Aave was the third-largest DeFi protocol at press time, with $6.33 billion in ""total value locked"" (TVL), which is the amount of collateral put into the system in exchange for loans or other transactions.      The investor community is cheering the outlook for lower fees resulting from Aave's decision to adopt Polygon.      ""Being able to interact with Aave without worrying about gas fees is a game-changer,"" one user tweeted. ""Now I understand why Aave is the powerhouse of DeFi.""      Bjelic predicted that other DeFi protocols would see Aave-like growth.      Curve Finance adopted Polygon's scaling solution earlier this month, saying that Polygon's high-speed and low-cost infrastructure is the perfect match for its mission to allow for seamless exchange of stablecoins.      ""Scaling narrative is accelerating, courtesy of Polygon and its layer-2 aggregator vision,"" Denis Vinkourov, head of research at the trading sentiment data provider Trade the Chain, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. ""The popular saying, 'Build it, and they will come,' couldn't be any more relevant after the likes of Curve and Aave announced support"" for Polygon.      ""Looking ahead, it's not just Polygon that will continue to attract new capital, but so will decentralized exchanges such as QuickSwap,"" Vinokourov said.",POSITIVE,BTC | MATIC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | MATIC,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/26/polygon-jumps-in-crypto-market-rebound-as-ether-congestion-drives-adoption-for-rivals,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/19d954450778e86bf5e04ca9345158f92523fa2c-1300x928.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The fifth-year tight end is the first National Football League player to be paid entirely in bitcoin. Offensive tackle Russell Okung, who famously followed through on his declaration to “pay me in bitcoin,” still takes half of his $13 million salary in fiat.      Culkin will start stacking biweekly sats via Zap’s Strike, the same fiat-to-bitcoin salary conversion service Okung uses. The Chiefs are aware of Culkin’s arrangement but his reserve contract is still denominated in dollars, he said.      “This is generational for me,” Culkin told CoinDesk.    Read more: Panthers’ Russell Okung Becomes First NFL Player to Be Paid in Bitcoin    Taking 100% of one’s income in BTC might not be a wise financial decision for everyone, Culkin admitted. But he said his financial expenses, risk parameters and long-term conviction in bitcoin made it the right move for him.      Culkin said he became aware of bitcoin in summer 2016 but it wasn’t until March 2020 that he began seriously considering it as an investment. One year later, Culkin is slated to swap his fiat income flow for bitcoin alone.      He said he’s unfazed by the very real possibility of market dips. Strike will automatically convert his cash paychecks to bitcoin no matter the price.      “I don't want to have to feel pressured to be like, ‘I don't know if I'm gonna buy this week,’” Culkin said. The system will allow him to remain “detached” from market movements so he can focus on football.

Announced Monday, the Washington, D.C.-based firm’s strategic Series B also included Abu Dhabi Catalyst Partners and WisdomTree Investments, which participated in Securrency’s $17.65 million Series A back in early 2020.      Big financial firms and asset managers have warmed to crypto trading but require some hand holding when it comes to connecting legacy systems to digital assets in a smooth and compliant way.      State Street, for example, recently raised its hand for potential crypto trading involving an infrastructure partner – only to lower it again shortly after the news landed. Other banks including Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs appear to be more open about plans to create crypto-focused wealth funds, for instance.    Read more: State Street May Start Trading Crypto on Platform It’s Helping Build    Securrency Chief Strategy Officer Patrick Campos described his company as a middleware layer that goes over the top of blockchains and legacy systems and then ties them all together using a common compliance framework.      “We offer optionality,” said Campos. “Maybe you like Tezos but you think Ethereum has a bigger community so it’s better to build on. We can create the assets where you need them. So for an institution like State Street, we can connect blockchain systems into their existing systems so that these things just talk to each other.”      Campos said there are Securrency micro-services that a firm can simply connect into by API, but for institutions looking to create workflows around something like collateralized lending, this could involve deploying a white-labeled version of Securrency's platform.

42386549,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBTz4F,1619438110,Ant Group Has Been Working With China’s Central Bank on Its CBDC Since 2017: Report,"Ant Group, the fintech affiliate of Alibaba Group, has revealed the extent of its work with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) on the country’s central bank digital currency (CBDC).    The company has been working on the project since 2017, according to a report by South China Morning Post, also owned by Alibaba.  Information revealed at the Digital China Summit in Fuzhou over the weekend showed Ant-backed online bank MYbank became one of the intermediaries to distribute the digital yuan in late 2017.  In June 2019, China’s digital currency institute began to use Ant’s mobile app development platform to develop the app consumers will use to send and receive payments using the CBDC.  Ant Group subsequently started to roll out the digital yuan across China at the start of 2021 following trials in late 2020.  The company's touting of its close ties with the PBOC comes in the wake of Chinese authorities forcing the company to suspend its expected initial public offering in November 2020 and later to restructure its operations to bring it more under the supervision of the nation’s regulator.  These actions came after Alibaba founder Jack Ma criticized China’s financial system and its state-dominated banking sector at a Shanghai event last October.  Ant’s boasting of its involvement in the digital yuan project comes as six state banks are promoting the use of the CBDC as an alternative to Alipay and WeChat Pay to scupper the duopoly in the country’s payments space, according to analysis by Reuters.  Meanwhile, Tencent also disclosed via posters at the event that the video game and social media giant has been involved in digital currency tests since February 2018.  A spokesperson for the company told the SCMP, “Tencent has been taking part in the PBOC’s e-CNY project from the start and will continue to carry out pilot trials in accordance with the guidance of the PBOC.”  Read more: China’s Digital Yuan Is No Threat to US Dollar, Says Bank of Japan Official: Report",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | FIAT | MARKET,Jamie Crawley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/26/ant-group-has-been-working-with-chinas-central-bank-on-its-cbdc-since-2017-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a39f61015efa316d4d783359c287b65313e49dd4-2560x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The JPMorgan bitcoin fund could roll out as soon as this summer, two sources familiar with the matter told CoinDesk. Institutional bitcoin shop NYDIG will serve as JPMorgan’s custody provider, a third source said.      JPMorgan’s bitcoin fund will be actively managed, multiple sources told CoinDesk. That’s a notable break from the passive fare offered by crypto industry stalwarts like Pantera Capital and Galaxy Digital, which let well-heeled clients buy and hold bitcoin through funds without ever touching it themselves. Galaxy and NYDIG are now offering bitcoin funds to Morgan Stanley clients.      The JPMorgan fund will be for private wealth clients, a source familiar with the situation told CoinDesk.    Read more: Morgan Stanley Bitcoin Fund Draws $29.4M in 2 Weeks, Filings Show    The move by JPMorgan marks a sharp turn for the $3 trillion bank.      JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon called bitcoin a dangerous fraud in 2017, threatening then to “fire in a second” any trader who touched the stuff. “If you’re stupid enough to buy it, you’ll pay the price for it one day,” he said at the time.      While he quickly walked back the “fraud” label and has more recently toned down his rhetoric, Dimon, who has repeatedly argued that government regulation of cryptocurrencies is inevitable, maintained late last year that bitcoin is “not my cup of tea.”      Despite its CEO’s personal disdain for the crypto, top deputies within its Corporate and Investment Banking division acknowledged in February that client demand might force the institution to change.      JPMorgan’s hulking investment, commercial banking and wealth management divisions have gradually evolved in their treatment of crypto and blockchain, even if the client-facing bitcoin fund is new. The bank’s research analysts regularly issue market insight on bitcoin’s price and prospects in reports available to clients.      The firm’s Onyx division seeks to speed up interbank payments via blockchain technology and JPM coin, for example. After five years of quiet development, Onyx is mounting a global hiring campaign for blockchain engineers.      On the Investment Banking side, JPMorgan issued its first crypto-adjacent investment product in March, a structured note tied to the performance of bitcoin proxy stocks such as MicroStrategy and Riot Blockchain.      JPMorgan’s new fund product, however, will be its first directly dependent on bitcoin’s performance.      Bank representatives did not respond to CoinDesk’s questions by press time.

According to a blog post on Monday, Binance will list MicroStrategy, Microsoft and Apple, providing Binance users with exposure via the tokenization of equities. The tokens are expected to be denominated in the exchange's stablecoin, BUSD.      The move means Binance users will be able to qualify for economic returns on the underlying shares, which will include potential dividends. The tokens also allow Binance customers to purchase as little as one-hundredth of a regular stock using BUSD.      Binance's stock tokens are tokenized equities that can be traded on traditional stock exchanges. Each tokenized stock represents one ordinary share of the stock and is backed by a depository portfolio of underlying securities held by CM-Equity AG, Germany, according to the post.

Announced Monday, Nexus is meeting DeFi’s growing demand with “Protocol Cover,” which means the decentralized mutual will now cover mishaps on other popular smart-contract networks such as Polkadot, Cosmos and Binance Smart Chain (BSC).      Nexus is also expanding its repertoire of insurable events beyond smart-contract hacks to include attacks on oracles, the vital data feeds that trigger contracts, as well as things like governance failings, the company said.      All told, the Nexus expansion is an interesting sign of DeFi’s growth – both on Ethereum and competing networks.      The Nexus expansion plan is blockchain-agnostic, so to speak, but lists particular projects. So SushiSwap, for example, runs on a few blockchains and those instances will all be covered by the mutual.      “We will add particular protocols as they come up,” Nexus CEO Hugh Karp said in an interview. “Some of them will already run on multiple chains, and so we'll upgrade so that if a project is running on Polkadot or Cosmos or Binance Smart Chain then we can start covering that.”    Read more: DeFi Insurer Nexus Mutual Raises $2.7M in NXM Token Sale    Nexus uses the U.K.’s legal framework of a discretionary mutual, where members have no contractual obligations to pay claims. Instead, a pool of NXM token holders on the Ethereum blockchain stake assets against the likelihood of insurance claims, and earn rewards or make payments in the event a claim is approved.      “The DeFi space has massively expanded creating new risks, and we’ve updated the product to expand the coverage to suit everyone,” Karp said. “Compared to the regular insurance industry, DeFi has these fast feedback loops and cycles where everyone learns from experiments really quickly and then adjusts. It’s incredibly powerful.”      Growth at Nexus has tracked the explosion in the DeFi space over the past 12 months or so. The active cover being provided by the mutual currently stands at about $700 million while the size of the staking pool (which fluctuates with the price of NXM) stands at about $1 billion.      “I think lots of institutional capital is starting to enter the space or at least exploring it. This [insurance alternative] is one of those key tick boxes,” Karp said. “We're getting some strong interest from that side of things.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | ETH | EXCHANGE | BNB,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/04/26/insurance-alternative-nexus-mutual-follows-defi-activity-to-polkadot-cosmos-binance-smart-chain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5fd5820db623b6efa890752e2c2d56c7198a58e1-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a rally that appeared to start around 22:00 UTC (6 p.m. ET) on Sunday, bitcoin (BTC) bounced off a seven-week low around $47,655, subsequently printing some of its largest hourly gains in two days.      The bellwether cryptocurrency was changing hands around $52,100 as of 2:16 UTC Monday, with buyer volume at the highest hourly levels since April 23.      Traders are speculating whether bitcoin might be correcting. Prices tumbled last week by the most since February, amid concern that U.S. President Joe Biden’s proposal to raise the capital-gains tax on cryptocurrencies and other investments might weigh on the market.      On the technical side, bitcoin's relative strength index – an indicator used to gauge trend momentum – shows the cryptocurrency is attempting a daily timeframe bounce from levels of oversold at 30.00 on April 25.      Other major cryptocurrencies were also in the green, gaining an average 3.7% on the day. Uniswap's UNI token posted some of the biggest gains, rising more than 14% over the last 24 hours.
