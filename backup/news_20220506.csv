According to DappRadar, there is a monumental 45% climb in organic trading volume of NFTs in April in comparison to the previous months. Solana NFT trading has skyrocketed in April, as Moonbirds also proved to boost Ethereum trading. Suggested Reading | Bitcoin Seen Dropping To $32K - But Not This Month - As Analyst Sees It Hitting $48K NFT Trading Volume Climbing There has been a marked sluggishness in February and March, but NFT trading volumes have bounced back in April with a remarkable increase of 45%.

42421602,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoiFB,1651876627,Why a New York Bill Barring New Crypto Mines Would Be Bad for Business,"The New York State Assembly recently approved legislation that would hinder economic opportunity and innovation across the state at a time when job and economic growth are crucial for the state’s economy.  Assembly bill A.7389C sets a moratorium on approving new applications or permits for digital asset mining operations, also known as proof-of-work mining, that use electric power generated by carbon-based fuels, such as coal. But this shortsighted proposal will accomplish little for the environment and bring real harm to areas of New York that are working to attract new, innovative businesses.  Teana Baker-Taylor is the chief policy officer for the Chamber of Digital Commerce, a leading trade association for the digital asset and blockchain industries.  Proof-of-work authentication verifies blockchain transactions for Bitcoin, and like all industrial activity, it uses energy. It’s a misconception, however, that proof-of-work mining uses more energy than other industries. New York policymakers have set aggressive goals to mitigate climate change. In 2019, the state implemented the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, requiring that statewide greenhouse gas emissions be reduced 85% by 2050, and that the state have net zero emissions in all sectors of the economy by that time.  In 2020, it was estimated that proof-of-work used 247 terawatts of power, which is about 0.16% of global energy consumption. Eliminating proof-of-work mining would not put a meaningful dent in carbon emissions and will slow progress in transitioning this country to more renewable energy production and usage.  Read More: New York State Assembly Passes Bill Blocking New Crypto Mines That Use Non-Renewable Power  Transitioning to greener energy sources requires significant investments in new energy technology from industries that are committed to working with policymakers and the energy industry. Proof-of-work miners serve as reliable base customers who provide consistent demand – and revenue – for utilities to build out clean energy infrastructure. An added benefit: They can power down to redeploy critical use of power elsewhere, almost instantly, something other high-demand industries simply cannot do.  For example, on occasions when customer demand spikes during the height of summer in Manhattan, or dead of winter in Buffalo, digital asset miners can work cooperatively with utilities to curtail their demand. The power being used by proof-of-work miners flows back to the grid giving retail consumers extra capacity in mere minutes with no adverse effects. No other industry that uses similar levels of energy, including data centers, cloud service providers and manufacturing facilities, has the ability to do this.  It’s also important to note that even as digital asset mining has increased in its adoption over the past few years, the Bitcoin Mining Council estimates that the global mining industry’s sustainable electricity mix is 58.5% and growing. The percentage for members of the Chamber of Digital Commerce Mining Initiative with infrastructure in New York is estimated to be even higher, closer to 80%. Few industries can boast such an environmentally friendly profile.  This sustainability impact will only continue to grow over time as digital asset miners form partnerships with energy providers, utilities, communities and other groups to develop new energy capacity in New York by providing new and valuable economic incentives for energy companies to build green infrastructure and sources of power. Evolving proof-of-work operations will increasingly shift to more efficient ways to power operations, while paying dividends to local communities, including jobs, particularly union jobs with groups such as the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) and increased local and state tax revenue.  Read More: What a Mining Moratorium Could Really Mean for New York’s Crypto Industry  Many states want to encourage digital asset mining operations and are poised to attract New York-based companies seeking a more welcoming environment. Georgia and Illinois have proposed tax incentives to attract digital asset mining companies to build facilities in their state. In Texas, stakeholders have noted that proof-of-work mining has helped stimulate the economy, create jobs, promote the development of renewable energy, such as solar and wind, and improve their tax base.  Digital assets technologies are an emerging, global financial industry. By some estimates, more than 100 million individuals worldwide have adopted Bitcoin. Proof-of-work mining is the foundation of this ecosystem. Digital assets are creating an opportunity for millions of people in less fortunate economic circumstances to access the financial system by storing their savings in a medium that is independent of rapidly increasing inflation, banks fees and long-standing inequities in our banking system.  It’s crucial that New York remains a leader in global financial services, rather than hindering an industry that is important to its future. Working together, the digital asset mining industry and New York can set the standard for expanding sustainable, ethical, business growth. The state Senate should vote down this proposal when it comes up for a vote in the coming days.

42435455,z5xashhl2ItpefZwyLxvFN,1651872534,Ice Cube's Basketball League Is Taking on New 'Owners' With NFTs,"O’Shea Jackson Sr.,aka Ice Cube, is an award-winning rapper, actor, filmmaker and co-founder of BIG3, a 3-on-3 basketball league that he started back in 2017 alongside executive Jeff Kwatinetz.  The South Central Los Angeles-born entrepreneur is now exploring Web 3 and is looking to divvy up ownership of BIG3 among its fans, giving them the option to “own” a bit of the sports league by purchasing NFTs, or non-fungible tokens.  The 12-team basketball league tapped serial entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk to act as one of the faces of the organization as it began experimenting with the world of crypto and “decentralized team ownership.” Vaynerchuk, who began his career in wine, is a leading expert of NFTs.  ""The real impact of the consumer blockchain and NFTs will be utility with hints of collectibility,"" the VaynerMedia CEO said in a Friday interview with Ice Cube on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover.”  See also: Gary Vaynerchuk Doodle Outsells Warhol, Pollock, Neel and More at Christie’s Auction  Vaynerchuk has emphasized how these supposedly scarce digital tokens are changing what it means to be a fan of something – in BIG3’s case by giving holders ownership-like value in the team.  The league is minting 12,000 NFTs. Each team will sell 1,000 tokens, including 25 ""fire"" tokens that cost at least $25,000, with the remainder going on sale for $5,000 apiece. What all this means for securities regulators is an open question.  Vaynerchuk said previously he would buy the full allotment of 25 “fire-tier” NFTs for the 2019 championship winning Triplets, a team coached by former professional basketball player Lisa Leslie and whose captain is Joe Johnson, a seven-time National Basketball Association All-Star.  Previous sports-NFT related tie-ups have seen success, like the industry-standard ""NBA Top Shot,"" which lets fans own recorded moments of gameplay.  It’s not just that Vaynerchuk is a sports fan, he also sees BIG3’s Web 3 play as representative of where the NFT industry might be headed.  “Utility is going to start [being at the] forefront or at least [become] equal to the collectability and community part,” of NFTs, Vaynerchuk said. BIG3’s tokens will “create scenarios” for fans – like giving them the opportunity to score courtside seats, meet players or even design team logos.  The press release announcing a “GROUNDBREAKING OPPORTUNITY FOR FANS AND INVESTORS TO PURCHASE TEAM OWNERSHIP STAKES” cites “additional ownership benefits,” including earning a “percentage of future team sales” as well as opportunities to advise teams and coaches and go to afterparties.  “We are thrilled to be lowering the barrier to entry to team ownership so our fans can take their investment to the next level,” Kwatinetz said in the press release.  Still, it remains unclear what “ownership” ultimately means. The BIG3 league still keeps the majority of control over the organization, Ice Cube said, and looks to have a series of private investors.  “It's really about getting in, understanding the world and then taking it [NFTs] to new heights.” Ice Cube said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | SPONSORED,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/05/06/ice-cubes-basketball-league-is-taking-on-new-owners-via-nfts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b15ec3e367e28ad760985dcf573c4e2836291ac4-1440x1077.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420814,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYcP7,1651871041,"While Most Crypto Prices Went Down, Smart Money NFT Trades Were Up: Nansen Data","The most searched keyword for all crypto searchers in the last 24 hours has been “crypto crash,” and yet shrewd cryptocurrency traders are still making big-brain moves.  Data from blockchain analytics firm Nansen shows the daily net profit and loss for all smart money addresses trading NFTs (non-fungible tokens). Since April 1, there have been 27 days of profitable NFT trading and nine days of negative returns for smart money wallets.  Nansen considers a wallet to be “smart money” if it is “historically profitable,” meaning it meets at least one of several conditions, including the following:  Being in the top 100 addresses in terms of estimated profits of their current NFT portfolio and the top 100 addresses based on an internal “hodler score metric.”  Having at least more than or equal to five times in realized profits on multiple NFT collections that were minted in the last 60 months.  Having made multiple trades on a decentralized exchange in a single transaction that are profitable in nature.  Belonging to an investment fund that invests and manages money in crypto.  Since April 1, smart money has invested 4,864 ETH, returned a total of 17,581 ETH and netted 12,717 ETH in NFT trading.  It is clear that smart money is not infallible, nor is every trade profitable, as demonstrated by the few red bars (emphasis on few). The largest loss for smart money wallets trading NFTs was on May 1, the day Yuga Labs released its Otherdeed NFT collection, where investors spent over 64,000 ether on fees alone.  In the past 24 hours, $2.18 million worth of rETH and $460,000 worth of aSTETH has poured into wallets categorized by Nansen as “smart money.”  Even though the “Fear and Greed Index,” which looks at several factors including volatility, volume, dominance and search engine trends to capture market sentiment, shows we’re in a period of “Extreme Fear,” smart money traders aren't sitting by idly, given their accumulation of Ethereum’s staking derivatives rETH and aSTETH.  rETH is a token for Rocket Pools users that represents their locked ETH on the Ethereum Beacon Chain, and in comparison, aSTETH is Aave’s yield-bearing token for stETH, representing staked ether in Lido’s protocol.  Smart money inflows of rETH and aSTETH during a time when regular market participants are apprehensive demonstrate the attractiveness of staked ETH for smart money.  In the same 24-hour period, roughly $2.8 million worth of gOHM, the biggest outflow among tokens tracked by Nansen, has exited one smart money address, labeled as “🤓 Smart LP: 0x413.” At the same time, $2.2 million worth of OHM has entered into that same wallet, which can be seen here.  Smart LP, one of Nansen’s many smart money wallet labels, is identified as a wallet that made at least $100,000 by providing liquidity to decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms SushiSwap and Uniswap, excluding so-called impermanent losses.  Aside from this trade, just over $400,000 worth of APE, the governance token for ApeCoin DAO, moved out of smart money wallets Friday, continuing their recent trend of unloading APE.  Even though Yuga Labs’ NFT collections have high floor prices and consistently have massive volume activity, the associated token hasn’t fared as well. Every day since Monday, APE has been one of the top tokens to leave smart money wallets. Between Monday and Friday, a total of roughly $3.7 million worth of APE flowed out of smart money holdings. Over the same time frame, the price of APE dropped almost 23% from a high of $17.21 to $13.26, according to CoinMarketCap data.  Nansen is one of many firms that parse publicly available information about crypto transactions, although unlike Chainalysis and similar firms, its services are geared toward giving investors an edge rather than helping law enforcement catch bad actors.  While cryptocurrency addresses appear on public blockchains as random-seeming strings of letters and numbers, Nansen uses algorithms, its own investigations and information submitted by users to draw inferences about the entities behind pseudonymous wallets.

42411811,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glg6Mt,1651869984,How Can You Share an NFT? Fractional NFTs Explained,"NFTs stand for non-fungible tokens; they aren’t interchangeable with each other unlike fungible cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC), where one bitcoin is always one bitcoin.  But is there a way to … ""funge"" NFTs? Well, indirectly, yes! Fractional NFTs represent shared ownership in NFTs, and it’s possible to cut up an NFT into millions of fungible tokens by locking them in the vaults of decentralized platforms.  The fractionalization of assets is common in traditional finance for high-value assets like vacation homes, aircrafts and luxury cars. This allows an investor to expose his portfolio to an expensive asset without having to own it outright. Put another way, fractionalizing an asset also fractionalizes the risks and costs associated with investing in that asset. The same logic applies to NFT fractionalization.  Some NFTs are known as blue chips, as the most expensive collections such as the Bored Ape Yacht Club, CryptoPunks and Moonbirds sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars or even for millions. Fractionalization reduces the cost of entry for investors who are normally priced out of these blue-chip assets.  Fractionalization of NFTs involves creating fungible tokens, which, in the case of the Ethereum blockchain, means ERC-20 tokens tied to underlying NFTs (ERC-721 tokens). But the price doesn’t necessarily track those NFTs: Investors and traders can trade them at a discount or a premium to the original valuation.  What are fractional NFTs?  A fractional NFT refers to a set of fungible tokens tied to a whole (e.g. one Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT) or a set of NFTs (e.g. several CryptoPunk NFTs). As the name suggests, it implies fractional – or proportionally shared – ownership of an NFT.  When an NFT is fractionalized, the original NFT is locked up in a vault, and someone issues a limited supply of fungible tokens that represent ownership over that NFT. These fungible tokens can be bought on fractional NFT platforms such as fractional.art and can also be traded on secondary markets such as Uniswap.  Some NFT projects also issue fungible tokens, such as the APE token from Yuga Labs, the creators of Bored Ape Yacht Club. These tokens don’t represent fractional ownership over the collection. Instead, they offer utility in some of Yuga Labs’ projects, such as the recent metaverse land sale where the token was used to pay for the NFTs.  What is the relationship between NFT fractionalization and valuation?  Fractionalization brings more liquidity to a notoriously illiquid market, because expensive NFTs can be traded in small portions. NFT holders can sell part of their NFT for crypto while retaining majority ownership. For investors, fractional NFTs offer exposure to an asset without having to buy the whole thing.  But the traded portion – as represented by fungible tokens – can also cause an NFT’s valuation to go up or down, as happened to the doge meme NFT.  In June 2021, PleasrDAO bought the doge NFT for 1,696 ether (about $4 million at the time). And in September 2021, the decentralized autonomous organization fractionalized the NFT into $DOG tokens and then auctioned off 20% of them. The high demand brought the valuation of the NFT to $225 million.  There’s no mechanism to stop a fractional NFT from deviating from the price of the underlying asset, and so investors should think carefully before making a trade.  What are some fractional NFT platforms?  There aren’t many tools and platforms to choose from, but a few stand out and can serve the needs of the current maturing NFT market.  Unic.ly is a popular platform. To fractionalize an NFT on Unic.ly, NFT holders need only to connect their wallet to create a fungible uToken – an ERC-20 token that represents ownership in a single NFT or a collection of NFTs. Users can trade those tokens or bid on the fractionalized asset through the platform.  The platform offers guaranteed liquidity through liquidity pools where investors can provide liquidity and also stake tokens to earn yields, similar to how liquidity pools and yield farming works in decentralized finance, or DeFi.     Fractional.art is another popular platform. It is similar to Uni.cly in the way it lets NFT holders fractionalize their assets and redeem ETH in return. Although it has no bidding and staking options, like Uni.cly, the platform offers more flexibility for developers through a basic and permissionless protocol design. Anyone who wants to build on top of Fractional’s protocol can do so, while Uni.cly’s more complex set of smart contracts is more limiting for developers.  NFTX is another platform for fractionalization, but it significantly differs from Uni.cly and Fractional. It allows pooling NFTs of equal value – for example, NFTs with similar rarity sitting at the floor price – into index funds. NFT holders receive ERC-20 tokens when they add an NFT to an index or buy a portion of the index. Users receive a vToken, which is a 1:1 redemption claim on an NFT in the index a user’s NFT was added into. This means the users won’t necessarily receive the NFT they deposited because all NFTs deposited are considered of equal value. After recent criticism, NFTX introduced the option of paying a 5% premium on the token price and letting the user choose the NFT he or she wants out of the index.  Other ways of exposing your investment portfolio to NFTs include the Index Co-Op’s The JPG NFT Index (JPG), which tracks a wide NFT basket that includes fractional NFTs such as $DOG but also other assets relevant to the NFT market.

Alternative cryptos (altcoins) were also relatively stable on Friday, although GALA rose by as much as 9%, outperforming other tokens on the CoinDesk 20 list. Also, Algorand's ALGO token was up by 12% over the past 24 hours.  Choppy price action over the past week continued to reflect uncertainty among traders, especially as macroeconomic risks linger.  Just launched! Please sign up for our daily Market Wrap newsletter explaining what happens in crypto markets – and wh  On Thursday, the Bank of England (BOE) hiked interest rates and warned the public about an economic downturn. That triggered fears of stagflation, or high inflation and slow economic growth, among investors. The BOE's grim outlook was the opposite of the U.S. Federal Reserve's upbeat tone on Wednesday, which temporarily assured investors that U.S. economic conditions could withstand higher rates.  Overall, the shift from accommodative monetary policy to more restrictive measures has led to an unwind of speculative activity among global investors. That could be headwind for stocks and cryptos this year.  Over the short term, price action remains neutral, and some altcoins have benefited from brief price spikes.

Readings below one indicate bearish sentiment among traders, similar to what occurred during previous downturns in price.  BTC's latest price range between $35,000 and $46,000 occurred alongside a persistent downtrend in the buy/sell volume ratio. That suggests some buyers have remained on the sideline despite short-term stabilization in price.  Ether holding up versus bitcoin  Ether (ETH) is down by 4% over the past week, compared with a 6% decline in BTC.  Typically, ETH underperforms BTC during down markets. This time, however, choppy trading conditions have capped the ETH/BTC ratio in a tight range over the past year. A decisive breakout or breakdown from the current range could confirm a risk-on or risk-off environment.  Bitcoin's dominance ratio, or BTC's market cap relative to the total crypto market cap, ticked lower over the past few days. That suggests altcoins have experienced less selling pressure relative to bitcoin, which means traders are still comfortable with additional risk.  Altcoins decline less than bitcoin during rising markets because of their higher risk profile. Still, similar to the BTC/ETH price ratio, a breakout or breakdown in the dominance ratio would confirm the next phase for crypto markets.  Altcoin roundup  DeFi tokens underperform: April fared relatively well for memecoins, such as dogecoin (DOGE) and shiba inu (SHIB), but marked big losses for decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens, including aave (AAVE) and thorchain (RUNE), research by crypto exchange Kraken noted this week.

42411799,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glg5mW,1651868623,Crypto Mortgages: How You Can Buy a House Using a Crypto-Backed Loan,"The latest crypto boom has created fortunes for many, and some of them are looking to buy real estate with their new riches.  There are plenty of examples of real estate developers who are keen to accept cryptocurrencies as payment, but for certain crypto investors, selling their digital assets is a no-go.  For them, crypto mortgages – loans for buying real estate where the collateral is crypto – is the solution.  Last August, United Wholesale Mortgage, the second-largest mortgage lender in the U.S., announced a plan to start accepting bitcoin payments, but backed off a few weeks later.  United Wholesale Mortgage's reversal, however, didn’t scare new players away from bringing mortgages to the crypto world, as a handful of lenders are rolling out plans to offer crypto-backed loans specifically for homebuyers.  Read more: How to Buy a House With Crypto: US Edition  How crypto-backed mortgages work  On a high level, crypto mortgages work in a similar vein as old-fashioned mortgages. The only difference is that the collateral are digital asset holdings.  If you take out a crypto mortgage, the lender first checks your crypto holdings to assess how much you can borrow. This is the most important factor in the decision, because crypto mortgage lenders won’t necessarily require credit history and paycheck stubs, although it doesn’t hurt to have those ready.  After the lender decides the terms – how much you can borrow and at what annual interest rate – you have to pledge an amount of your crypto holdings to the lender as collateral of the loan. That is usually equal to 100% of the loan. For example, the collateral would be $400,000 worth of digital assets for a $400,000 loan.  When you close the loan and buy the real estate, you start paying back the loan in monthly installments that can be paid in selected cryptocurrencies or in traditional fiat.  As the market grows and competition increases between lenders for homebuyers' crypto riches, one can expect offerings and accepted digital assets to broaden.  Where can you get a crypto mortgage  Crypto mortgages are still quite a new phenomenon, but there are a growing number of lenders that let homebuyers leverage their digital wealth. All annual percentage rates are current as of the time of writing.  Milo, a Florida-based startup, made headlines early this year for being the first to offer crypto-backed mortgages in the U.S. for prospective homebuyers. The firm specializes in mortgages for real estate investment purposes and offers 30-year loans of up to $5 million with rates ranging from 3.95% to 5.95%. Milo doesn't require a down payment (the borrower can finance up to 100% of the property’s value), and it accepts bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and a few stablecoins (USDC, USDT, Gemini USD) as collateral.  USDC.Homes offers crypto mortgages for those who want to buy real estate in Texas. The lender accepts bitcoin, ether, USDC and other cryptocurrencies as collateral to borrow up to $5 million for a 5.5% to 7.5% APR. The down payment of the crypto mortgage is staked, so borrowers accrue interest on the collateral offsetting a part of the monthly mortgage payment.  Figure, a North Carolina-based lender, opened a wait list for crypto mortgage loans of up to $20 million. It plans to accept bitcoin and ether as collateral and offer 30-year fixed rate mortgages with monthly collateral adjustments for as low of an annual rate as 6%.  Ledn offers bitcoin-backed loans in Canada and is planning to offer bitcoin mortgages to clients in Canada and the U.S. this year.  Who are crypto mortgages for?  At this time, crypto-backed mortgages aren't the ideal way for most people to buy a new home.  But it can be an interesting option for those homebuyers who have built wealth mostly held in cryptocurrencies and who don't want to sell their crypto investments.  Read More: Location, Location, Location: Investing in Real Estate in the Metaverse  Pros of crypto mortgages  If you are one of them, there are some perks of leveraging your crypto holdings for a loan:  First and foremost, you don’t have to cash out of your crypto investments to buy a house with a crypto mortgage. This is important because selling your investments would incur capital gains taxes.  It might be easier for foreign citizens to buy real estate in the U.S., as crypto mortgage providers usually don’t require credit score and a social security number.  For someone who believes their crypto holdings will appreciate more substantially than the rate of the loan over time.  Risks and downsides of crypto mortgages  The reason a crypto mortgage isn’t right for most people is simple: Crypto’s price is highly volatile, making them high-risk investments.  If you take out a loan on top of your crypto investments, the risks are compounding. When cryptocurrency markets crash, they bring down the value of the collateral, too.  In this case, two things can happen:  When the price of the digital assets you have put up as collateral drops, the lender may require you to add more of your investments to the collateral – akin to a margin call in traditional markets. This way, your capital is locked and you cannot trade it.  If the market value of the collateral falls even deeper, the creditor might have to liquidate – force sell – your assets for a fraction of the price of the investment you have put into it.  There are other downsides of taking out a mortgage loan backed with a cryptocurrency portfolio:  Borrowers don't have control over the assets used as collateral, meaning that they cannot trade or otherwise use the crypto pledged.

Helmed by esports veteran Rahul Sood, the crypto gaming studio has previously attracted investments from Andreessen Horowitz and the Chainsmokers’ venture fund. Its first title, the play-to-earn game MechaFightClub, allows non-fungible token (NFT) owners to battle for glory and profit through robotic chickens.  “It’s basically a fighting game based in the future where every character in the game is an artificially intelligent non-player character living on the blockchain as an NFT,” Sood said in the March 16 episode of the “Around the Coin” podcast.  The weighty funding round comes as MechaFightClub prepares to release its extraterrestrial robot chickens publicly.  According to the game’s website road map, the “Genesis” drop event will issue 6,969 “pre-fertilized, highly potent EGGs” to eager owners who will train them for the “COCKTAGON” – a “professional arena to where our characters battle in professional fights,” according to a trademark filing submitted to the U.S. government.  The project’s “breeding” mechanics mirror that of the popular play-to-earn title Axie Infinity, where new NFTs can be created from the eggs of old. In MechaFightClub lore, the eggs come from an alien species in the not too distant future. They can level up as they triumph, earning crypto rewards the players can spend on their birds or withdraw from the game.  “Our goal is to build an emotional attachment between the characters and their birds, sort of like a Tamagotchi on crack,” Sood said during the podcast.  According to SEC documents, 11 investors joined the $40,000,044 sale of a mix of equity and options. Irreverent Labs previously raised $5 million in its November funding round.  An avid gamer and the founder of gaming platform Unikrn, Sood said in the podcast there’s an explosive opportunity for crypto crossovers, despite the “allergic” backlash hardcore gamers have for NFTs.  “But at the same time there’s a lot of these new Web 3 gamers that are getting into the space that really see the future of where things could go,” he said. “For us that’s a massive reason why we’re building on blockchain.”  Sood did not immediately reply to a request for comment.",POSITIVE,없음,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/06/tamagotchi-on-crack-irreverent-labs-raises-40m-for-nft-cockfighting-game,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8fa0203fbe1b73b1b51e4c153cb2f147d9790b73-2048x1405.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

One study suggests that the digital content market size in 2019 was approximately $11B. This value is expected to grow at a compounded rate of 12% by 2030. Digital content refers to any information that takes up an audio, video, image, or text format. The content requires various digital software which helps in developing and distributing information. Why Choose Web 3.0? In the current internet (web 2.0), creators can easily share their work with an audience through social websites. Hence, this concept is accelerating the idea of global participation amongst consumers and creators. Creators are, however, not cultivating enough value from their hard work. Prominent companies such as Facebook and Amazon use algorithmic procedures which negatively affect content creation. This disadvantage is driving authors to Web 3.0 as their alternative internet solution. While it may still be in its inception stage, many believe that Web 3.0 could become more favorable and profitable to use.

42421603,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoiHF,1651863116,Why on Earth Would Land Be Scarce in the Metaverse?,"First off, thanks to Nir.eth, part of the team at NFT platform Yup.io, who gets credit for bluntly stating a worry that has been nagging me for years.  This is not just a valid question, but a white-hot and vital one that has been tearing around Crypto Twitter in recent days. Yuga Labs, creators of the Bored Ape Yacht Club, this week completed the sale of “Otherdeeds” for virtual land plots in its planned “Otherside” metaverse project, netting a staggering $285 million for the company. The floor price for Otherdeed NFTs has dropped as much as 12% since the sale, which feels like a top signal in a space where similar “blue chip” mints have often seen rapid post-launch runups.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Why is land valuable, anyway?  Of course, metaverses will face the issue of copycat proliferation. There are dozens of metaverse projects spinning up right now, and as Multicoin Capital's Tushar Jain recently pointed out, they can all sell ""land.""     But the issues raised by Nir and others in recent days are much more fundamental, and may point to flaws in the model regardless of the competitive landscape. Above all, the idea that geographic space in a virtual world will accrue value in the same way as real-world land seems to miss some truly fundamental distinctions.  In the most basic terms, real-world land values are based on location and utility. A piece of real-world land is valuable based on how long it takes to get to other locations you want to go, which is why land in Tokyo and New York are among the most valuable in the world: They’re close to cool stuff. This geographical reality is inextricable from the scarcity of real-world land since each piece of land has an entirely unique geographical location relative to every other piece of land.  The problem for buyers of metaverse land, then, is very straightforward: In a 3D digital world, all distances are fake.  See also: Get Ready for the 2022 Metaverse Real Estate Boom | Opinion  There’s no inherent reason that any piece of virtual land should be more valuable based on its location, any more than a web address is valuable because it’s “closer” to another. In a virtual world, you can just teleport your avatar to any location, instantly. As another Twitter user observed, this means shoring up metaverse land values would require imposing entirely artificial restrictions on users, making the experience worse and ultimately deterring the users that are the real source of a metaverse’s value (on which more in a second).  Then there’s the second value of real-world land, its practical utility. In the real world, that can include things like whether it has the right soil or water sources for farming or other natural resources. But again, there’s no such thing as a “natural resource” in a metaverse, so making virtual land track the value structure of the real thing would involve tying certain rights to it.  In a thread critiquing the land-sale model, Nifty Island co-founder Charles Smith points out that the most obvious move here is tying the right to create content to land ownership.  But implementing this fix to shore up land values would have the contrary effect of harming the user experience and, in turn, scaring off creators who make shared worlds appealing and valuable. “Look at minecraft, roblox, and even youtube,” Smith went on to ask. “Would these platforms be better if the right to create on them was limited to a tiny number of land holders?”  Nifty Island has been vocal about excluding land sales from its model. At the very least, that suggests an appealing option for investors looking to diversify across different funding models.  The financial skeuomorphism trap  In light of this critique, you could describe the entire idea of investing in metaverse land as a form of “financial skeuomorphism.” Skeuomorphism refers to the tendency to design digital products in ways that mimic the physical world, and was a particularly hot topic in interface design during the early development of the iPhone.  Over time, visual skeuomorphism in interface design has faded as people get more used to the differences between digital and physical objects. The same could very well happen with metaverses, with the added twist that a bunch of people just invested $285 million, not in Yuga Labs stock, but in the financial equivalent of a drop-shadow app icon.  See also: Is 'Meta' Already Giving Up on the Metaverse? | Opinion  And while Apple was able to move away from skeuomorphism gradually, metaverse projects wedded to the valuations of their land plots may have swallowed a poison pill they can only expel directly into the faces of their investors. To prop up land values, developers may have to impose artificial limitations that harm the user experience, and eventually, the actual value of the system. Conversely, making a metaverse easier to move around or create content within would almost inherently harm land values.

42435454,z5xashhl2ItpefZwyLxvCP,1651862668,Web 3 IRL: Seattle’s CafeDAO Tests Brick-and-Mortar DAO Model,"A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) called TheCafeDAO opened a pop-up coffee stand in Seattle last weekend, a test run for what it hopes will be the first brick-and-mortar business run entirely through a DAO structure.  The humble coffee stand was located outside the Seattle NFT Museum, with a menu that consisted of just one item – pour-over coffee for $5 a cup.  The DAO markets itself as “the cafe everyone owns,” with customers and employees being given “coffee tokens” that grant governance rights and discounts with each purchase. The tokens themselves are still in an alpha stage and have yet to be connected to any blockchain, with the DAO using last weekend’s pop-up as a trial run for the tokenomics.  It's the latest in a string of DAO experiments seemingly kickstarted by the splashy but ultimately failed debut of the ConstitutionDAO last November, proving to many the potential and difficulty of DAOs doing real-life things.  Read more: LinksDAO NFT Sale Books First $10M Toward Buying an Actual Golf Course  The idea for TheCafeDAO first came about in a Reddit post made last August by Dan Car, one of the DAO’s founding members. His question: “What if we made a decentralized Starbucks?”  The idea quickly gained traction, with the organization’s five other core members all seeing the post and volunteering to take leadership roles to bring the concept to life.  While the group’s focus in recent months has been on the Seattle pop-up, the DAO’s founders hope it can eventually become its own larger, self-sustaining entity.  With the DAO still in its early stages, the founders also recognize that decisions aren’t yet all that decentralized, though that will likely change as the community continues to grow.  “Our goal is for the Discord to grow enough where we no longer have to make decisions ourselves about the future of the DAO,” Dustin Tong, another founder of the DAO, said in an interview. “Just yesterday someone posed the idea of running a hot dog stand with the DAO. That would be awesome.”  Coffee with a side of governance  On the back end of the DAO’s coffee token is a setup more complex than your average reward coin.  The value of each token is $5, pegged to the price of a 12-ounce cup of coffee. Every time a coffee from the stand is purchased, a new token is minted.  A chunk of that token, roughly $3.50 worth, is then burned to account for operating costs. The remaining portion is then split among the customer, employees and DAO treasury. Token holders can either redeem their coins for fiat or hold them for governance rights, with one cup of coffee equaling one vote in whatever proposals are made by the DAOs members.  The tokens are backed by loans, with the parties making the loans being given a promise of future token allocation down the line. (Tong says the group has been in close contact with legal experts to avoid any regulatory concerns.)  In its two days of business last weekend, the DAO minted 61 of its imitation coffee coins, with 12.2 being burned for operating costs, 6.1 being given to customers and 36.6 reallocated to the treasury.  For customers, the tokenomics essentially function as a decentralized punch card, where every purchase brings them closer to holding one full coffee token.  “In terms of governance, we want to create a list of standard operating procedures and then have those be the things our members are voting on,” Tong said. “We don’t want for someone to spill coffee and have all the DAO members vote for who cleans it up, that’s just not efficient.”  While the pop-up was open for only two days, members of the DAO are now looking to fundraise to create a permanent storefront somewhere in the Seattle area.  TheCafeDAO isn’t the first DAO eyeing physical locations as an extension of online community. NFT (non-fungible token)-based projects like LinksDAO and PizzaDAO have similar plans in the works, using the DAO structure to both fundraise and operate fully fledged, real-life operations.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/06/web-3-irl-seattles-cafedao-tests-brick-and-mortar-dao-model,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7e7d6377cfd987c5de905df5db12138ba61ff17b-3024x1701.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421596,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoi8z,1651862332,Inflation Will Create a Political Vacuum. Can Bitcoin Fill It?,"They called it the Great Moderation.  After Federal Reserve governor Paul Volcker broke the back of U.S. inflation in the 1980s, the U.S. and other western economies enjoyed a blissful, multi-decade period of benign consumer price trends, with modest, predictable increases averaging around 2% per year. It was a key contributor to a positive feedback loop: Trust in central banks’ independent monetary policy grew and became entrenched, and, as a result, economies and stock markets boomed.  There were some rough spots – the dot.com collapse in 2000 and the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, to name two biggies – while an ever-widening haves-versus-have-nots gap bred disillusion with the political model upon which Wall Street generated its riches. Nonetheless, the fact that inflation, with all the uncertainty and stress it brings to economic decision-making, had become a distant memory meant the ship of economic expansion was consistently put back on course.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  And now? What does the current experience with rising prices mean for the long-term global economic outlook? And what might that mean for Bitcoin? Its advocates present it as an inflation hedge, but in recent months it’s done little to earn that status as its price in dollars has swung in line with the ups and (mostly) downs of the stock market.  The way to think about these questions is to consider the impact that persistent price uncertainty has on economic and, just as important, political decision-making.  Uncertainty is back  With inflation pegged at 8.5% in March and the Fed instituting its steepest rate hikes in 22 years to try to bring it down, Americans across the economic spectrum – not only those in lower-earning segments of society – are grappling every day with economic dilemmas they haven’t faced for decades. Do I buy that new car now in case it’s more expensive in the future, or should I worry about my job security, given all the talk of an imminent recession? This kind of uncertainty, translated across society, has a profound impact on the economy at large.  This uncertainty is an unpleasant experience for anyone other than the savviest (and luckiest) people who figure out how to make money in an inflationary environment. And inevitably it has political consequences. Think of how Jimmy Carter’s single-term presidency was doomed by inflation in 1980. Or consider the constant turnover in governments in economies dogged with inflation, such as Argentina.  Already, many believe President Joe Biden is doomed to go the way of Jimmy Carter. His approval rating was a dismal 41.3% in the latest Gallup poll.  Adding to Biden’s concerns: the specter of stagflation, a double whammy of inflation plus unemployment that pandemic-related supply chain disruptions could bring upon us. The fear is that even if the Fed drives us into recession, softening aggregate demand will fail to break the inflationary cycle because it will be offset by the price appreciation effect of supply-driven costs.  Already, news out of Amazon and Apple has flagged the blow to corporate bottom lines from supply problems brought on by China’s latest COVID-related lockdown. It’s a potential recipe for stagflation. And that’s a politician’s nightmare.  Shifting political equation  Beyond the ballot box dangers to incumbent leaders, it’s possible the politics of inflation will be quite different from those in 1980. Back then, there was greater trust generally in how society is governed. Over time, coincident with the disruption caused by globalization and the internet, confidence in government, in corporations, in law enforcement, in the media and in other important institutions has since waned, as documented by Edelman in its annual Trust Barometer report.  This rising ennui brings another layer of unpredictability to the political and economic decisions people will make. If, for example, Donald Trump is again the Republican candidate for 2024, what will it mean for all those swing voters who, in 2020, voted against him in disgust? Maybe they’ll hold their noses and put him back into power, but they won’t be happy about it. And Democrats, well, they’ll be downright depressed. There’ll be a level of mistrust in the political outcome and in the system that delivered it that wasn’t the case with Ronald Reagan’s victory over Carter in 1980.  There’s a growing sense, in other words, that traditional politics won’t be the solution to our economic woes.  Money matters  How will this political disillusionment affect how people think about money?  Well, it's worth recognizing that for millennia money has been a largely political project, with governments seeking to control its issuance and circulation. The fiat money era of the past 50 years has been the apex of that effort.  But throughout history, when trust in the political system has dropped to low levels, people have turned to alternatives, gold being the principal example.  Now, Bitcoin offers an alternative, one with valuable properties beyond just being a store of value. Most importantly, bitcoin is digital, which means it can be integrated into the predominant internet economy with programmable capability. And its functionality – both its enforced scarcity and its transaction and recording mechanisms – is set by what is essentially a communal process of consensus.  In other words, Bitcoin is actually an alternative governance system for our money. There’s no guarantee that people will choose it en masse, but this current era of economic and government uncertainty and the mistrust it will sow in institutions offers as good a case as any for them to do so.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Michael J.

Proceeds will be used to buy Bitmain S19J Pro mining rigs for Alborz’s 40 megawatt (MW) data center in Texas that is powered by a 163MW wind energy source. Once the rigs are delivered, the mining facility will generate approximately 1.3 exahash per second (EH/s) of mining power.  “This credit facility provides an attractive source of non-dilutive financing at the Alborz data center,” said Tyler Page, CEO of Cipher.  The deal comes as debt financing has been hailed by Wall Street analysts as a positive catalyst for the miners, given it doesn’t dilute existing investors, unlike an equity raise.  Cipher was spun off from bitcoin (BTC) mining hardware giant Bitfury in March 2021 and went public via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) deal. The shares of Cipher have fallen 37% this year, while the price of bitcoin has dropped 25%.  Cipher began its mining operations in February of this year at its Alborz data center. By the end of the first half of 2023, the company plans to deploy approximately 445MW of electrical power capacity, according to a recent annual filing.  The annual filing also shows that Cipher has entered into mining purchase contracts to deliver hashrate of about 8.5 EH/s in 2022, based on agreed delivery schedules with Bitmain and SuperAcme and assuming timely deliveries. Of this mining power, Cipher is expected to own about 7.2 EH/s, with the remainder going to WindHQ.

In two of Nvidia’s Form 10-Qs for fiscal 2018, Nvidia reported material growth in revenue within its gaming business, said the SEC in a press release. However, continued the agency, Nvidia was aware – but failed to disclose to investors – that the boost in sales was, in significant part, driven by crypto mining.  “NVIDIA’s omissions of material information about the growth of its gaming business were misleading given that NVIDIA did make statements about how other parts of the company’s business were driven by demand for crypto, creating the impression that the company’s gaming business was not significantly affected by crypto mining,” said the SEC.  Nvidia has agreed to a cease-and-desist order and the payment of a $5.5 million fine to settle the SEC’s allegations.

42435453,z5xashhl2ItpefZwyLxvDt,1651845711,Ready Games Raises $3M to Bring Web 2 Gaming to the Web 3 World,"A traditional gaming startup is trying to bring Web 3 gaming to the frontlines of crypto skepticism – the Apple App Store.  Ready Games raised $3 million in a sale of its new AURA token to develop a Web 3 mobile gaming arm, the company announced Friday.  The raise was led by Bitkraft and Hashed and included participation from Tribe, IOSG, Spartan, Mapleblock Capital and Polygon.  Ready Games’ Web 3 division will focus on “incentivizing Web 2 game programmers to explore and switch to Web 3, while distributing games ‘as normal’ through traditional app stores,” according to a press release.  Founded in 2016, the company believes it has all the expertise needed to solve the challenge of mobile GameFi adoption, leaning on existing relationships between both long-time game publishers from the old world and the gaming guilds of the new.  “In a sense, we’ve unblocked for thousands of game studios the ability to be like a testnet,” David Bennahum, CEO of Ready Games, told CoinDesk in an interview. “Through Ready they can very quickly, in sub-30 days, take an existing Android or Apple game and bring it on-chain.”  VCs’ big bet on Web 3 gaming  The raise gives shades of C2X’s $25 million token sale announced in March, which was also backed by Hashed with a special emphasis on mobile GameFi adoption.  This new genre of funding comes prefaced by hundreds of millions of dollars being poured into blockchain gaming from various funds in the past year, with the Terra and Solana ecosystems being the leading destinations for investor cash flow.  Funding taken care of, the industry is still staring down some sizable obstacles on its path to mainstream success. Many crypto-native game publishers have steered clear of App Store involvement because Apple (AAPL) takes a 15% to 30% cut of all in-app purchases, which would apply to NFTs and in-game digital assets as well.  Then remains the stigma against NFT gaming integrations by the anti-crypto crowd, which was on full display during Ubisoft’s first foray into the tech last December.  Bennahum, like many in the space, sees the adoption of blockchain into mobile gaming as more of an inevitability than a gamble.  “You need to really educate people on the best practices, that’s how we solve these problems,” Bennahum said. “How do developers ultimately become owners of the blockchain piece of their game? I’ll just say the Ubisoft thing is really a separate issue, that’s the pitfall of going on-trend with something and not really fully thinking through the long-term value.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | SOL | SPONSORED | TOKEN SALE,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/06/ready-games-raises-3m-to-bring-web-2-gaming-to-the-web-3-world,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/983f8fe3896ba8b9ab460804715adcbbbb5ee8d0-4096x2160.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin inches towards the $35,511 mark, and altcoins are getting a beating too. Bitcoin responded to the Federal Reserve&apos;s 50 basis-point interest rate hike by dropping more than 10% in one day, its most significant decline in two months. Related Reading | Cardano Prepares For Major Update, Will It Be Enough To Push Bears Back? Most of the crypto market was up early today, with bitcoin hitting $40,000 after yesterday&apos;s Federal Reserve meeting. Other cryptocurrencies that performed well in the early hours are Cardano, Solana, Polkadot, and Avalanche. The afternoon market dived, and all cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, recorded a significant decline. BTC fell 10%, while altcoins also saw a considerable fall. The second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum fell by 7.8%; other altcoins also had a major decline. For example, DOGE had dropped 5.4% in the last 24 hours while SAND was down 11.8%. As the cryptocurrency landscape was bearish last week following a rejection at $40,000, it quickly returned below that level and kept losing value. This resulted in an almost two-month low of under $35,511 per coin. Yesterday, it was reported that the asset failed to stay above $39,000 and eventually fell below $38,000 again.

Will buyers at $3.5 manage to sustain the selling pressure? Key technical points: KDA market price approaches the $3.50 mark. The RSI value approaches the oversold boundary. The 24-hour trading volume of Kadena is $46 Million. Past Performance of KDA KDA prices maintain a downtrend after the recent death cross in the daily chart resulting in a fall from the $6 mark to the $3.5 support before finding a bullish reversal. However, failing to sustain the uptrend above the psychological milestone of $4, the KDA prices fall drastically overnight, sharing the market sentiment. Source-Tradingview KDA Technical Analysis KDA prices return to the $3.5 support level with increased selling pressure projecting a potential downtrend to the $3 mark. Following the recent death cross, the 100 and 200 EMAs are ready to give a bearish crossover, reflecting a surge in the underlying bullishness. Hence, the EMAs are ready to achieve the bearish alignment in the daily chart. The MACD and the signal line fail to give a bullish crossover as the lines fail to merge due to the sudden bearish takeover. Hence, the lines maintain a downtrend to dive deeper into the negative territory with a minimum bearish spread.

In adding Blender.io, ether (ETH) and bitcoin (BTC) addresses, OFAC is seeking to block the service and its operators from tapping the global financial system. Friday's update listed 46 bitcoin addresses and 12 ether addresses. The bitcoin addresses were all tied to Blender, while the ether addresses were linked to the North Korean hacking group Lazarus. OFAC has previously sanctioned several ether addresses and Lazarus itself on suspicion of stealing over $600 million worth of crypto from play-to-earn game Axie Infinity's home-brewed sidechain, Ronin.  Blender is allegedly involved in ransomware attacks, the Treasury Department said in a press release, as well as various other cyberattacks, including March's infamous Ronin hack, which saw Lazarus Group allegedly compromise Axie's sidechain. OFAC has already sanctioned several ether addresses linked to the attack.  This is the first time a crypto mixing service has been added to OFAC's sanctions list.  ""Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned virtual currency mixer Blender.io (Blender), which is used by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) to support its malicious cyber activities and money-laundering of stolen virtual currency,"" OFAC said in a press release.  According to the release, about $20.5 million in proceeds from the Ronin attack was laundered through Blender. While OFAC only sanctioned Blender on Friday, other mixing services like Tornado Cash have also featured prominently in chain analyses tracking the stolen funds. Over 21,000 ETH (worth about $56 million at press time) stolen from the Ronin network were laundered through Tornado Cash last month.  ""While the purported purpose is to increase privacy, mixers like Blender are commonly used by illicit actors. Blender has helped transfer more than $500 million worth of Bitcoin since its creation in 2017. Blender was used in the laundering process for DPRK’s Axie Infinity heist, processing over $20.5 million in illicit proceeds,"" Treasury's statement said Friday.  The statement went on to add that ""virtual currency mixers that assist criminals"" threaten the nation's national security, and that the Treasury Department would continue to crack down on these services.

42435458,z5xashhl2ItpefZwyLxvJp,1651842343,The NY Mining Moratorium’s Odds Just Got a Lot Worse,"A bill that aims to place a two-year moratorium on certain types of proof-of-work crypto mining operations in New York was dealt a huge blow on Friday.  The bill is sitting in the Senate Environmental Conservation committee, but according to a schedule released early Friday morning, the committee has decided not to consider the bill during its last meeting of the session.  The legislation has drawn ire from many in the crypto industry who fear that the moratorium – which in its current form is much narrower than an earlier version that sought to place an all-out ban on mining for three years – could be the beginning of a slippery slope that ends with all crypto mining being banned in New York.  Read more: What a Mining Moratorium Could Really Mean for New York’s Crypto Industry  But there is also concern from both industry and lawmakers that the proposed moratorium, whether it becomes law or not, sends a bad signal to the crypto industry. They worry that the proposal could push business and the jobs and taxes that come with it out of the state.  “I think one of the biggest issues [with the bill] is that you have ‘New York’ and ‘moratorium’ in the same sentence,” said John Olsen, the New York state lead for the Blockchain Association.  The Assembly version of the bill, sponsored by Assemblywoman Anna Kelles, a Democrat from upstate New York, passed last week. The Senate version of the bill, which is backed by state Sen. Kevin Parker, must also pass in order to be signed into law by Gov. Kathy Hochul.  When a bill is referred to a committee, the committee can pass the bill either as is or with amendments, reject it or ignore it. The Environmental Conservation committee – chaired by state Sen.

42374765,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw2d8Z,1651841047,"US Jobs Report Shows Gain of 428,000, Adding to Price Pressures","The U.S. economy added 428,000 jobs in April, exceedingexpectations, a report by the Labor Department on Friday showed.  Economists had estimated a 400,000 gain in the nonfarm payrolls, according to data from FactSet. The growth in April was on par with the revised 428,000 additional jobs reported for March.  The unemployment rate was unchanged at 3.6%.  ""Job growth was widespread, led by gains in leisure and hospitality, in manufacturing, and in transportation and warehousing,"" the report stated.  The monthly employment situation summary is closely watched by investment analysts and economists when assessing whether a strong labor market might translate into faster inflation.  Bitcoin and the Fed  Many investors see bitcoin (BTC) as a hedge against inflation, but the largest cryptocurrency, just like the stock and bond market, has recently seen a big price drop in reaction to the Federal Reserve's hawkish campaign to tamp down the upward pressure on consumer prices.  The current labor market is considered by many economists to be at full employment, as there were 11.3 million job openings in February but only 5.4 million people were looking for a job that month.  According to Friday's Labor Department report, average hourly earnings rose0.3%, up 5.5%year-over-year.  The added payroll number as well as the unemployment rate put increased pressure on the Federal Reserve as it plans its next steps to bring down inflation, currently running at 8.5%, the highest in four decades.  A tighter job market tends to drive wages up, since workers have more options, and employers have to pay up to recruit or retain them; then the employers will often try to pass along the elevated personnel costs to consumers in the form of higher prices for goods and services.  Rising labor costs  During the first quarter of this year, employers paid workers 1.4% more on average than during the prior three-month period, according to a report released last week. It was the biggest jump in two decades.  The central bank’s key role is to keep prices stable and maximize employment, but the current situation in the job market drives up inflationary pressure and works against the Fed, which is hawkishly trying to bring down prices while at the same time avoiding a recession.  In a press conference on Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell described the current labor market as “very, very tight” and that it was at an “unhealthy level.”  “You can see that the labor market is out of balance,” he said. “There aren’t enough people to fill these job openings and companies can’t hire, and wages are moving up at levels that would not over time be consistent with 2% inflation.”  In order to bring the labor market back to normal levels, where demand and supply is in balance, there needs to be price stability, Powell said.  But demand and supply imbalances don’t look to ease anytime soon, according to an economists’ report from BNP Paribas.  “Even if various price metrics top out over the next few months, labor conditions will broadly inform policymakers’ inflation assessment,” economists at BNP Paribas wrote. “So in addition to price metrics, labor gauges … will factor prominently into the Fed’s interpretation of incoming pricing data – and we do not see much relief (if any) on this front over the next few months.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/06/us-jobs-report-shows-gain-of-428000-adding-to-price-pressures,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d3309e0341ef946382d3dd21b274f04a808397fe-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Indeed, with legitimate cryptocurrency use growing significantly faster than criminal use, illicit activity&apos;s percentage of bitcoin trading volume was never smaller. In 2021, cryptocurrency-related crime reached a new peak. In 2019, illegal addresses got $14 billion, climbing from $7.8 billion in 2020. From 2020 to 2021, the overall amount of transactions surged by 567% to $15.8T. Despite all of that, crypto is safer than fiat. Changpeng Zhao Claims Crypto is Safer Than Fiat Earlier today, Changpeng Zhao, the founder of Binance, took to his Twitter account to inform his followers why he believes that cryptocurrency is way safer than Fiat. He quoted some crypto crime analysis by Chainalysis and United Nations in his tweet. According to Chainalysis, illegal addresses accounted for only 0.15 percent of total cryptocurrency trading volume in 2021 According to the United Nations. In a single year, money laundering is estimated to be 2-5 percent of worldwide GDP or $800 billion to $2 trillion in US dollars. DeFi Crimes What has changed in the previous 12 months?

42374760,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw2d3X,1651836126,Bitcoin Breaks Bullish Trend Line; US Jobs Data Eyed,"Bitcoin's daily chart is leaning bearish ahead of U.S. April payrolls and wage-growth data that could influence market expectations about the pace of the Federal Reserve's monetary tightening.  On Thursday, the leading cryptocurrency fell nearly 8%, printing a UTC close under an ascending trend line that connected bullish higher lows from Jan. 24 and Feb. 24.  The breakdown of the three-month rising trend line perhaps implies the resumption of the broader decline from November highs. Popular indicators like the relative strength index (RSI) and the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram are also biased bearish.  Support is seen at $34,322, the Feb. 24 low, followed by the Jan. 24 low of $32,933, according to the charting platform TradingView.  The non-farm payrolls report scheduled for release on Friday at 12:30 UTC is likely to show the economy gained 391,000 jobs last month after adding 431,000 in March, according to FXStreet.  The unemployment rate is likely to have dropped to 3.5% in April from 3.6% in March. Wages probably grew 0.4%, or 5.5% on a year-over-year basis, the same pace as the preceding month.  With the Fed focused on bringing down inflation, the jobless rate and wage-growth numbers are likely to overshadow the payrolls figure.  A tight labor market and wage increases cause inflation, so an above-consensus wage-growth figure and a drop in the jobless rate may bolster inflation worries and increase the odds of a 75 basis point rate increase next month. That might bring additional downside pressure for risk assets, including bitcoin (BTC).  The Fed on May 4 raised the benchmark interest rates by 50 basis points and suggested that large increases are likely in the coming months. The central bank also said it would start reducing its near $9 trillion balance sheet.  While Fed Chair Jerome Powell said policymakers aren't actively considering a 75 basis point hike, that guidance may have been based on expectations the labor market will cool and inflation will peak.  Powell made it clear the central bank is open to tolerating an economic recession to bring down inflation, leaving the door open for renewed repricing of even bigger increases.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/06/bitcoin-breaks-bullish-trendline-us-jobs-data-eyed,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/756ab380200dcbf835ad66e0cbe49de82ea17ebb-2786x1342.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The survey also found that more central banks are developing or testing a retail CBDC, which is a digital currency designed to be used by consumers versus a wholesale CBDC, which is meant to be used by banks.  The report published on Friday by BIS, an umbrella group for central banks, presented the results of a survey of 81 central banks conducted in autumn 2021. The survey explored the level of engagement by banks in CBDC work, along with their motivations and intentions concerning CBDC issuance. BIS is owned by 63 central banks that represent about 95% of the world's total GDP.  More than half of the surveyed central banks are developing CBDCs or ""running concrete experiments,"" according to the results. Around 20% are developing or testing a retail CBDC, which is twice the number of central banks working on a wholesale digital currency.  Around the world, central banks are actively exploring CBDCs as economies look to strengthen their digital payments and banking infrastructure. From potentially improving financial inclusion, to speeding up cross-border transfers, CBDCs theoretically hold many promises, but with China taking the lead in developing and testing a digital yuan, some governments around the world are also viewing CBDCs as a play for monetary sovereignty.  In September 2021, BIS signaled central banks around the world to start working on CBDCs. According to the Atlantic Council's CBDC tracker, 87 countries representing over 90% of the global economy are working on CBDCs.  ""On average, almost six out of 10 respondent central banks said that this growth has accelerated their work on CBDCs,"" the report said.  Jurisdictions represented in the BIS survey make up close to 76% of the world’s population with 56 of the surveyed central banks representing emerging and developing economies.  While central banks in the Bahamas, China and Nigeria have already issued or are piloting a retail CBDC, the survey found that other jurisdictions will likely follow with 68% in the ""foreseeable future.""  In addition to questions about CBDCs, the survey also asked central banks about stablecoins (cryptocurrencies pegged to the value of other assets or currencies like the U.S. dollar) and cryptocurrencies in general.  ""Central banks differ in their expectations that stablecoins will scale up and become widely used and accepted as a means of payment, depending on the type of stablecoin,"" the report said, adding that central banks seem to believe stablecoins backed by a single currency are far more likely to succeed as a method of payment over other types of stablecoins pegged to commodities or other cryptocurrencies.  About 70% of central banks are looking into the potential impact of stablecoins on monetary and financial stability, while around a quarter are studying the use of cryptocurrencies.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | FIAT,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/05/06/nine-out-of-ten-central-banks-exploring-digital-currency-bis-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/edc239d651b932bd5a384c207de0b0f30c37a46f-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Key technical points: AVAX market price approaches the $50 mark. The MACD indicator fails to give a bullish crossover. The 24-hour trading volume of Avalanche is $1.285 Billion, reflecting a hike of 57%. Past Performance of AVAX Failing to accept the power dynamic bullish trend shift shows an early reversal from the $67 mark. Unfortunately, the reversal comes with a boom in trading volume and accounts for a fall of 12% to create a bearish engulfing candlestick.

Hence, traders can expect the downtrend to briefly breach $55 to test the psychological mark of $50. With the recent death cross, the chances of 100 and 200 EMAs giving a bearish crossover increases significantly. Hence, the EMAs are ready to achieve the bearish alignment in the daily chart. The MACD and the signal line fail to give a bullish crossover as the lines fail to merge due to the sudden bearish takeover.

42374766,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw2d9p,1651828644,DeFi Tokens Are April's Biggest Losers as Revenues Fall; Memecoins Outperform,"April fared relatively well for memecoins, such as dogecoin (DOGE) and shiba inu (SHIB), but marked big losses for decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens, including aave (AAVE) and thorchain (RUNE), research by crypto exchange Kraken noted this week.  Considering bitcoin’s (BTC) 17% loss as a benchmark, the broader DeFi sector lost 34% on average, closely followed by tokens of layer 1, or base blockchains, at 33%. DeFi relies on smart contracts instead of third parties to provide financial services, such as trading, lending and borrowing, to users.  DeFi tokens have been the biggest losers on a yearly basis with over 71% in average drawdowns for investors. Ether (ETH), the native token of Ethereum over which most DeFi protocols are built, gained 3% in comparison.  DeFi-centric RUNE slumped 51%, the most in that sector, while the minimum loss was 22%. Among layer 1s, Solana’s SOL, Avalanche’s AVAX, and Near Protocol’s NEAR slumped at least 34% in the past month.  DeFi projects also saw a drop in revenues, which are earned each time a user conducts financial activity on the protocol with the protocol receiving a small cut of volumes as fees. The drop likely occurred as token prices fell and interest among investors took a hit.  Financial services platform SushiSwap saw a 29% drop in revenue, while those on DeFi exchange Balancer fell as much as 66%. Their corresponding tokens, SUSHI and BAL, have lost 45% and 18% over the past month, respectively, CoinGecko data shows.  Curve (CRV) and Uniswap (UNI) were the only DeFi projects to post revenue gains. Curve earned 51% more in April than it did in March, while Uniswap made 13% more. The strong fundamentals failed to attract buyers, however, as CRV and UNI lost 15% and 34%, respectively, in the past month.  Memecoins and exchange tokens were the relative outperformers among crypto sectors. Memecoins lost an average of 19%, while exchange tokens – such as OKX’s OKB and FTX’s FTT – lost just 13% on average. Privacy tokens also outperformed with 16% in gains, buoyed by the likes of Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC).  Meanwhile, trading activity in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) increased in April compared to prior months, even as the number of users remained the same. Average daily volumes bumped 40%, while the average transaction amount increased by the same percentage as well.  Popular Ethereum-based NFT collection CryptoPunks lost favor among investors, slipping to the third spot by market capitalization as the Mutant Ape Yacht Club jumped to second place with a $2 billion capitalization.",NEGATIVE,NEAR,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | NEAR,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/06/defi-tokens-are-aprils-biggest-losers-as-revenues-fall-memecoins-outperform,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

Bitcoin futures racked up $191 million in losses alone, Coinglass data shows, suggesting most trading activity and open interest was limited to the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Ether (ETH) futures followed with $64 million in losses.  Liquidations occur when an exchange closes a leveraged position as a safety mechanism due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. That happens primarily in futures trading, which only tracks asset prices, as opposed to spot trading, where traders own the actual assets.  Bitcoin fell from $39,800 on Thursday morning to below the $36,000 support level following a sell-off in U.S. equities. Reports suggested the plunge came as traders priced in higher rates to curb inflation in the U.S., despite a rally on Wednesday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the country would do everything in its power to curb inflation.  Major cryptocurrencies showed relatively lower losses. Futures tracking Solana’s SOL saw $9 million in losses, followed by Terra’s LUNA at $6.7 million. That was despite the two tokens losing as much as 10% in the past 24 hours – suggesting the sell-off was led by spot assets.  Among other alternative currencies, apecoin (APE) futures saw the most losses at $11 million, followed by stepn (GMT) at $10.36 million. Dogecoin (DOGE) futures lost $4.56 million after underperforming the market on Thursday.  Over $161 million in liquidations occurred on OKX, the most among crypto exchanges.

Drops DAO, a decentralized lending platform, is celebrating the launch of its mainnet, unlocking its ecosystem for users to borrow loans and interact with everything the ecosystem has to offer. Announced Wednesday, the transition to the mainnet will provide users with collateralized loans for NFTs, DeFi assets, and metaverse collections. The launch of the mainnet allows users to lock their assets as collateral, providing the NFT and DeFi ecosystems with additional liquidity and utility. Now, users can easily use their idle NFT, metaverse and DeFi assets as collateral to borrow instant loans through its lending tools. This means users can access capital without relying on centralized entities, enhancing the growth and boosting adoption rates for DeFi and NFT projects.

Swan, which offers bitcoin-based services for companies, hopes that monthly bonuses will be a major step in spurring mainstream bitcoin adoption. Klippsten said that a good company benefit usually has a greater perceived value than its actual cost. Such plans generate enthusiasm for the cryptocurrency and help people learn about it.  Each month, up to $100 in bitcoin is deposited directly into employees’ Swan accounts. Companies that participate in the program pay Swan $2 a month per employee and take a 1% transaction fee.  Wilson Auto Group, Compton Magic and Voltage, among others, are already receiving positive feedback from employees.  “There is a ‘Stack Sats’ culture in Bitcoin, so being able to help team members stack more satoshis is a win-win for culture and their long-term savings,” Graham Krizek, founder and CEO of bitcoin infrastructure company Voltage, told CoinDesk via email.  C.J. Wilson, a bitcoin enthusiast and CEO of Wilson Auto Group, which owns car dealerships in Mississippi and Tennessee, said he was “trying to orange pill” his employees to accept bitcoin. The reference to the movie ""The Matrix"" has been adopted by bitcoin advocates to describe such acceptance.  Wilson employee Chris Williams, who has already received $100 in two payments, is among the early converts, calling the program “genius.""  “It's fantastic. I got a deposit this morning … I've set up my account with my own personal email and then it's gone straight into my account,” Williams said.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MINING,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/06/swan-bitcoin-benefit-plan-helps-companies-reward-employees-in-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/51bb339f183193567a741b0a36591802084a2f07-612x408.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
