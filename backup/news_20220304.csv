Dippies Dippies are the modern-day adaptations of hippies but with the same value. When you think of a hippie, what likely comes to mind is a character that is out of touch with time. You think of flowers and Woodstock. But this idea of hippies itself is outdated. In reality, hippies have evolved as the years have gone by. With the advance and sophistication of technology today, this evolution of the average hippie has enabled and ushered in a new era of hippies. The result?, digital hippies (Dippies). Unlike the average idea you might have of hippies, while Dippies are still carving their path themselves, they are still very much in touch with society. Rather than trying not to be part of the system (as we&apos;ve come to associate hippies with), Dippies are building businesses that would help them layer themselves across the system. Across the world, Dippies are building global communities. This is against existing in small communities off the grid.

42423709,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2ecph,1646431591,Convex Finance Bug Causes CVX Token to Sink on Forced Token Unlock,"A smart contract bug has forced a team to prematurely unlock a huge portion of its token’s circulating supply, sending markets into disarray.  In a Twitter post Friday, the Convex Finance team wrote that it had redeployed the contracts responsible for the vote-locking governance mechanism after the discovery of a bug that would have granted certain users disproportionate rewards.  “There were no instances of [the bug] being used prior to deployment of the new vlCVX contract. However, since Convex Finance contracts are immutable and non-upgradeable, a new contract had to be deployed. The new vlCVX contract has implemented a fix for this potential bug going forward,” the team wrote in a blog post.  It’s the latest example of the perilously experimental nature of decentralized finance (DeFi), a $200 billion industry where supply shocks, smart contract bugs and volatile prices are often the norm.  Convex’s vote locking mechanism is key to the project’s token economy, one that allows for users to collect “bribes” from protocols and direct liquidity deposits into another protocol, Curve Finance, but only if users lock their tokens for 16 weeks.  This mechanism plays a key part in the complex, multilayered battle to control voting power in another protocol’s token, Curve Finance’s CRV, colloquially known as the “Curve Wars.”  Read more: CRV Extends Rally as ‘Curve Wars’ Intensify  The vote locking mechanism also plays a key role in managing CVX’s circulating supply, with over 72% of the supply locked earlier on Friday. Frequent CVX traders often track major unlock dates, as they can lead to supply and price fluctuations.  As such, the sudden, unexpected unlock of millions of tokens has led to a significant supply shock on Friday.  Prices fell as much as 20% from $19.10 to $15.22 in a matter of hours.  However, large holders have stepped in to add to their positions, and many users have opted to re-lock their tokens rather than take the opportunity to sell, even during a time of macroeconomic uncertainty due to the war in Ukraine.  While volatile, prices have been rebounding throughout the afternoon, as CVX currently sits at $16.55, down 15% on the day.",NEGATIVE,CRV,BLOCKCHAIN | CRV | MARKET | TRADING,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/03/04/convex-finance-bug-causes-cvx-token-to-sink-on-forced-token-unlock,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3f35f42baf71fa8e4b9076a11b151dd7f01af4d0-5262x3508.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42423712,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2eczh,1646429542,Market Wrap: Cryptos Slide; Analysts Expect a Volatility Spike,"It has been a choppy trading week for cryptocurrencies, which kept some buyers on the sidelines. Stocks were also under pressure as tensions between Russia and Ukraine escalated.  On Friday, a fire broke out at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, and conditions around the facility remain unstable. The incident kept global investors on edge, contributing to further gains in oil prices and traditional safe haven assets such as gold and the U.S. dollar.  Bitcoin (BTC) briefly dipped below $40,000 on Friday, and is up 2% over the past week, compared with a 4% decline in ether (ETH) over the same period. Bitcoin's outperformance relative to altcoins suggests a lower appetite for risk among crypto investors.  Technical indicators are mostly neutral for bitcoin, although a significant loss of upside momentum on long-term charts points to continued selling pressure. Still, the cryptocurrency could stabilize around the $37,000-$40,000 support zone over the short term.  ""I am cautiously optimistic,"" Timothy Brackett, a technical analyst at The Markets Compass, said during an interview on CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" show this week. Brackett pointed to signs of improving short-term momentum and key support levels that have kept the bull market intact over the long term.  Meanwhile, other analysts suggest volatility could increase this month, which could trigger additional price swings.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $39,418, −5.96%    ●Ether (ETH): $2,610, −6.74%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $4,329, −0.79%    ●Gold: $1,971 per troy ounce, +1.90%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 1.72%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  The chart below shows a decline in bitcoin's trading volume across spot exchanges, according to CoinDesk data.  Typically, large volume spikes during sell-offs coincide with price lows. Over the past few months, volume spikes have been minor relative to the May 2021 extreme. Further, long liquidations and open interest in the bitcoin futures market remain steady, indicating little reaction among market participants to recent price moves.  Potential volatility spike  ""Despite the huge amount of uncertainty in the market, option volatility is relatively cheap year over year,"" Gregoire Magadini, co-founder of Genesis Volatility said during an interview with CoinDesk.  ""BTC volatility is known to spike on price drops. May 2021 is a perfect example. I think the potential for an upside volatility spike is being underestimated by the market,"" Magadini said. He also expects the futures basis to rally from 3% to 15% in the coming months, especially if spot prices move higher.  ""We added to our longer-term options position, selling the volatility spike post-invasion,"" QCP Capital, a crypto trading firm, wrote in a Telegram chat, referring to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The firm has been tactically accumulating a long volatility position, ""expecting outsized volatility"" going into the U.S. Federal Reserve meeting March 16-17.

It’s been quite the round trip for bitcoin this week, with the bulls encouraged by a dramatic move higher from midday Monday that carried the price from $38,000 to above $45,000 early Wednesday. The divergence from struggling stocks didn’t last long, though, and bitcoin’s hasty retreat has picked up steam this afternoon.  Checking stocks, the Nasdaq is down another 2% Friday and the S&P 500 index off 1%. The action in Europe is way worse, with Germany's DAX shedding 4.4% , France's CAC 40 down 5% and Italy's stock exchange off more than 6%.  Not to be forgotten is the U.S. Federal Reserve, with Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday – worried about the economic impact from the Russia-Ukraine war – nevertheless promising a 25 basis point rate hike later this month. The U.S. central bank doesn’t need more ammunition for tightening monetary policy, but got some anyway in Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report. The data showed a whopping 678,000 jobs added in February versus expectations for just 400,000.  Adding to market pressures Friday was a Bloomberg report the Biden administration is considering banning oil imports from Russia.

Bitcoin Leverage Ratio Hasn&apos;t Budged Much In Response To Price Plunge As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC leverage ratio has remained at high values recently, despite the price declining to $41k. The &apos;estimated leverage ratio&apos; is an indicator that&apos;s calculated by dividing the open interest with the exchange reserve. In simpler terms, what this metric tells us about is how much leverage Bitcoin futures investors are using at the moment. Here, &apos;open interest&apos; is the measure of the total amount of futures contracts open on derivatives exchanges. And the &apos;exchange reserve&apos; is the total amount of coins currently present in wallets of all derivative exchanges. When the value of the Bitcoin leverage ratio goes up, it means investors have started to add more leverage to their positions. On the other hand, a decline shows futures holders are closing up their positions. This may be due to mass liquidations or because of investors opting to take less risk right now.

42421647,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXotRt,1646418564,"Ukraine Fundraisers Bring Out the Best, and Worst, in Crypto","Cryptocurrency has been shockingly central to the unfolding invasion of Ukraine, where news this morning finds Russian forces capturing a crucial nuclear power plant and other objectives.  Some have wondered whether crypto might be useful for evading the devastating sanctions being laid against Vladimir Putin’s government and cronies (the answer: probably not). More broadly, the sanctions mark a politicization of global banking that validates many of the points on which crypto was premised.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The crypto community has also put its best foot forward with a truly remarkable fundraising campaign. After Ukraine set up official wallets to receive both bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), coiners have donated approximately $40 million.  For comparison, the U.S. government is currently debating a $6 billion package of aid to Ukraine, so crypto holders have already donated about 0.75% of what the U.S. might, maybe, give. And the crypto arrived nearly instantly, in the midst of an ongoing invasion, with no strings attached. It is reportedly already being deployed to buy supplies for Ukraine’s war effort.  That makes the crypto donations, dollar for dollar, considerably more useful than U.S. funds that will arrive … eventually. It’s a vindication for crypto as a technology, and can’t hurt the community’s social reputation.  But there has been at least one dark lining to the silver cloud, in the form of an apparent display of crass and amoral greed from crypto’s infamously bottom-feeding opportunists.  On Wednesday, Ukraine’s crypto fundraising effort announced that it would be conducting an airdrop to those who had made donations. (An airdrop is an unsolicited distribution of a cryptocurrency token or coin, usually for free, to numerous wallet addresses.) There were few details of what crypto might be dropped, but a reasonable guess would have been some sort of “thank you” token with little explicit monetary value.  See also: Airdrop Ethics: VC Firm Draws Ire  But even tokens with little or no explicit value can do very strange things in the casino-like crypto market. For instance, the ConstitutionDAO’s PEOPLE token in December reached a market cap of more than $800 million, though it was launched to manage just $40 million in initial donations.  That history helps make sense of what happened next: a massive surge in small donations to the Ukraine addresses. From perhaps a couple of hundred donors per hour, the volume surged to several thousand. While this looks superficially like a wave of generosity, it’s really anything but.  Instead, this surge appears to largely represent an effort to, in one observer’s words, “game the airdrop.” Most appear to have been small donations of less than $30 worth of ETH. According to one analysis, over 20% were from new wallets created only for donations.  That suggests the new donors were hoping to make a minimal donation, then get airdropped tokens in return that – who knows! – might somehow wind up being worth more than the donations. The generation of entirely new wallets further suggests a so-called Sybil attack, or users pretending to be multiple people so they can claim the airdrop more than once.  This sort of behavior has been somewhat normalized by self-proclaimed “degens” who spend time maximizing returns of all sorts across crypto systems. There’s even a certain logic to encouraging borderline abusive behavior among the users of open financial systems, because it helps test the systems’ resilience while they’re still niche and experimental. But as those systems suddenly collide with the grim reality of war, such Wild West, anything-goes behavior looks less like adversarial testing of experimental systems and more like old-fashioned war profiteering.  If you’re one of those who attempted to manipulate the fundraising efforts of a democratic nation being invaded by the forces of a vicious dictator and former spy … well, just sit with that for a moment.  Maybe also sit with the fact that blockchain records of what you did will be around as long as Ethereum exists. It's entirely possible for anyone who's curious and sufficiently motiv`ated to find out who the attempted war profiteers are. You’ve created a permanent record of your own dishonorable venality.  See also: 'Crack Down' on Crypto? Maybe, but You Can't Ban Math | Opinion  And, in the end, you don’t have anything to show for it. Perhaps in part because of the attempted Sybil attack, Ukraine’s minister of digital transformation announced Thursday that the airdrop would be canceled. There was mention of Ukraine issuing NFTs, but it’s unclear if these would be an airdrop or a separate fundraising effort.  So congratulations, degens – you rugged yourselves. Not just financially, but ethically.  The good news is these shenanigans will likely wind up as a footnote to the broader surge of genuinely helpful crypto donations. That would be the deepest possible vindication of crypto and open finance. Because, sure, there are plenty of selfish miscreants out there. But if you let people make their own decisions, the majority will make the right one.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | AIRDROP,David Z.

42423716,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2ecrh,1646415952,Pplpleasr Will Not Always Please You: The Rise of NFT Artist Emily Yang,"For much of her life, Emily Yang struggled with an inability to say no or speak for herself.  “It’s the culture that we were brought up with,” she said. “As Asians, we are always taught to be humble and not speak up.”  But after two years in crypto, Yang is no longer a people pleaser. Now, she’s Pplpleasr.  That’s the handle the 27-year-old artist goes by in the non-fungible token (NFT) art world, where Yang is a rising star. She recently sold an animation advertisement for $525,000, created an art collective with more than $700,000 from sales of her works, contributed all of the above to charity, and made the Forbes 30 ""Under 30 2022"" list.  The advertisement sale was made for the biggest decentralized exchange, Uniswap, a protocol using smart contracts to facilitate transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. The art collective is PleasrDAO, a decentralized automated organization (DAO) that experiments with shared ownership of art pieces.  Perhaps most anticipated among the NFT smart set, Yang just launched her first Web 3 interactive short film, ""White Rabbit,"" without outside commission, on her newly established decentralized film distribution platform, Shibuya.  A few weeks before Shibuya's unveiling, CoinDesk found Yang standing in the dim room of a digital art gallery in downtown Manhattan. A camera crew surrounded her as she roamed the room filled with offbeat NFT animations accompanied by psychedelic fast-tempo soundtracks.  She was in the middle of a project with Coinbase (COIN), the Nasdaq-listed cryptocurrency exchange, and Freethink, a digital media startup, that records her life as an NFT artist.  The crew visited her apartment, dined with PleasrDAO members and went to the Superchief Gallery NFT in New York, billed as the world’s first in-person NFT gallery.  Wearing blue jeans and a black, fitted T-shirt, Yang recounted her journey from frustrated, aspiring artist to NFT celebrity – and how she took advantage of decentralized technologies to explore new frontiers of expression.  DeFi Summer  “I’ve been drawing ever since I was really young,” Yang said. “I like to constantly take in information, whether it's the commercials, movies, music, videos, TV shows, anime.” But with Asian parents, there was a part of her life where she had to “forget about” the artsy part of herself.  Born in Taiwan, Yang went to elementary school in Canada and moved back to Taiwan with her family until high school. She then attended the University of California, Los Angeles, for a design media arts degree. It was in college that she rediscovered her love for the creation of 3D animation in Pixar movies.  Yang worked as a visual effects artist at several studios since she graduated in 2015. Intermittently she designed visual graphics for motion pictures like ""Batman v. Superman"" for Moving Picture Company and ""Wonder Woman"" for Double Negative, as well as the announcement cinematic of the video game Diablo IV for Blizzard Entertainment.  She knew about cryptocurrency since 2014 or 2015 but did not have money to take part in the trend. In 2017, after realizing that her savings in traditional banks were only earning income at a 5% interest rate every year, she started researching cryptocurrency on Reddit. Soon she became fascinated with the innovation in blockchain technology. However, the crypto bear market hit in 2018 so she put the matter on the back burner.  Fast forward to 2020, which Yang says was one of the lowest points in her life.  Her job offer to be a digital artist at Apple (AAPL) was rescinded due to the coronavirus pandemic. Unemployed and worried about her future, she started seeking other ways to make money.  That moment coincided with the so-called DeFi Summer – the period of mid-2020 when the crypto industry suddenly saw a proliferation of newly launched decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols – semi-automated, blockchain-based software programs allowing users to make transactions without financial intermediaries like banks.  A friend told Yang to check the DeFi projects out on Twitter. She soon found out there were all sorts of memes with a sense of humor that resonated with her but few of them were high-quality, emotional work, in her opinion.  “They should hire me,” Yang joked to her friend about the lack of creative talent in the space. She turned the joke into reality by selling some of her personal artwork to the DeFi projects as Twitter posts. “This was to pass time while I was applying for jobs,” Yang said, “I only did that to make myself feel like I was not wasting life.”  Yang soon made a name for herself. Many of her animations went viral on Twitter, and soon Uniswap, a protocol of much bigger scale, approached her with an ad request for the launch of a system upgrade. She then made the video named “x*y = k,” the price curve function behind Uniswap. In it she portrayed a unicorn walking in a colorful forest, searching for the Ethereum wonderland.  Life-changing event  The decision to auction off the video as a NFT for charity changed Yang’s life.  “It ended up selling for 310 ether (ETH), and then the PleasrDAO was born. All these can happen at once,” Yang said. At the time, in March 2021, 310 ETH was worth around $525,000 and PleasrDAO was originally a project gathering the community’s strength to support Yang’s work and go beyond.  In its intro, PleasrDAO members wrote that their mission is to “collect digital art that represents and funds important ideas, movements and causes that have been memorialized on-chain as NFTs.”  One milestone was purchasing Edward Snowden’s NFT for $5.5 million and donating the proceeds to the Freedom of the Press Foundation that works to preserve and strengthen the First and Fourth amendment rights under the U.S. Constitution guaranteed to the press through encryption tools and more.  In September she cooperated with Fortune to create the Fortune Journalism PleasrFund.  The fund is dedicated to “advancing independent investigative journalism,” according to Fortune’s account on Endaoment.  It was partly seeded by the proceeds of Yang’s artwork for Fortune, including a print magazine cover that sold for $768,000 as a NFT. She created the Stand with Asian Community Fund with what she made from the Uniswap video. The fund quickly distributed $600,000 to 24 grassroots groups and small nonprofits that can make an immediate impact on the Asian American and Pacific Islander community, according to its community fund impact report.  Cultural conflicts are something with which Yang personally struggles. She fights it with her ideal in art.  “I would say every creator’s dream is that they can work for themselves,” Yang said, “whether you are a writer or filmmaker or artist. Instead of executing somebody else's vision, you want to make your own.”  What is now on the Shibuya platform is only the first episode of the ""White Rabbit"" series. Viewers holding producers passes can vote for the one of the two endings at the end of the first episode, deciding the future fate of the main character and her plot development .  “It’s an animated series,” Yang said a few weeks before the launch, her eyes lighting up, “The idea is to explore themes about crowdfunding and Web 3 interactive short films.”  Standing in the gallery with the Uniswap piece projected behind her, Yang talked to the camera about her motives. Galleries like this are where she goes when she experiences creator’s block, she said.  “This is a very exciting time where we like-minded people, who are not comfortable with just accepting the reality, come up with creative ways to artistically or technically push the boundaries of what's possible,” she said.",POSITIVE,ETH,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | UNI,Angelique Chen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/03/04/pplpleasr-will-not-always-please-you-the-rise-of-nft-artist-emily-yang,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e236f83955a58e8ef64692e3e62727f91fc33c9e-4032x3024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421659,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXotcD,1646414345,"If Ever There Were a Time for Financial Freedom, It’s Now","In years hence, when we look back on how cryptocurrencies became integrated into the global economy, this week may be viewed as a turning point.  For one, there was the unprecedented phenomenon of a besieged European government crowdfunding armament procurement with donations from around the world, demonstrating not only crypto’s global capacity for peer-to-peer fund transfers but also the power of decentralized action as decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and other crypto communities swiftly mobilized. At the same time, the West’s swift move to cut off Russian banks from the SWIFT messaging system gave people a crash lesson in the gatekeeping plumbing of the incumbent international financial system to which cryptocurrencies offer an alternative.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  More importantly, people have been forced to reckon with cryptocurrency’s value proposition and what it means to embrace it.  Crypto is about financial freedom. It has always been about freedom. But at least now we have a stark set of scenarios to help people get their heads around it. I hope that will help them not only see crypto’s potential to change entrenched paradigms but also to consider with more open minds the challenges it poses to our existing priorities and assumptions.  These issues were thrust into the spotlight by decisions from crypto exchanges such as Kraken and Binance to deny a Ukrainian request that they disable transfers to all Russian accounts, indiscriminately. Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told Rachel Maddow that she was “disappointed” that some “so-called crypto exchanges” were “refusing to end transactions with Russia for some philosophy of libertarianism or whatever.”  This might seem reasonable to you. After all, assigning blame between the two warring forces in this conflict is pretty much black and white. So, why not keep the crypto money flowing to Ukraine’s bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) addresses but starve Russia? What’s so wrong with that?  The problem is this isn’t just about blocking the Russian central bank’s assets or seizing the yacht of a Vladimir Putin crony oligarch under order of sanctions. A blanket block on Russian crypto accounts would cut off millions of ordinary citizens, many of whom are now desperate for money as panic provoked by sanctions has drained ATMs of cash and crashed the ruble’s exchange rate. This would arbitrarily and individually target Russian citizens.  Among all those cut off from funds, there’d be no way to determine who among them supports the war. By many accounts, dissent runs far deeper in Russia than the thousands of brave souls who’ve turned up to protests in Moscow and were arrested for their troubles. Given Russian authorities’ standoffish approach to bitcoin, it’s fair to assume Putin’s domestic cronies aren’t big crypto users. Meanwhile, there are a multitude of reasons why it’s near impossible for the government to use crypto to avoid sanctions in any meaningful way, as Blockchain Association General Counsel Jake Chervinsky and others have pointed out. There’s a bigger point to all this: Crypto’s raison d'etre is to be a store of value and a medium of exchange that people can freely use without interference by outside parties. The minute that is impeded, for whatever reasons, that higher purpose is lost.  To be sure, whenever bitcoin users move funds out of self-custody wallets into centralized custodial exchanges such as Kraken and Binance to buy or sell fiat, they relinquish the mode of autonomy on which cryptocurrency’s freedom-inspired ethos is founded. However, the most successful among them are trusted because, consumed by that same ethos, they are aligned philosophically, economically and fiduciarily with their customers' belief in it (and roundly castigated any time they stray from it). Officials should recognize and support the principled stance these exchanges are taking toward their users.  My own support for it, by the way, does not stem from “some philosophy of libertarianism or whatever.” It is grounded in the practical reality that – to quote the pseudonymous Web 3 thought leader 6529: “There are no other constitutional rights in substance without freedom to transact.” The idea: It’s all very well for governments to profess support for free speech, but if they prevent citizens from obtaining or sending funds to pay for, say, a computer or for internet access, they effectively deny them that right.  The widely cited tweet thread from which 6529’s comment was lifted was produced in response to Canada’s move to force exchanges to restrict crypto payments to people associated with the truckers protest there – a situation that now seems tiny in comparison to the crisis facing the world.  It’s hard to find anything positive arising from the horrors in Ukraine. But if there is one, it might be that Russia’s despicable actions have restored a fervor in the West for the freedoms we enjoy and an acknowledgment that we must fight to protect them.  I hope this newfound awareness of the need to promote and protect financial freedom also arises from this moment.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | BNB,Michael J.

42423695,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2ecPh,1646412016,"Cipher Mining Scraps Plan to Buy Bitfury Rigs, Sticks With Bitmain, MicroBT","Bitcoin miner Cipher Mining (CIFR) abandoned its plan to buy Bitfury rigs this year, saying it aims to be more flexible, CEO Tyler Page said during a call with investors on Friday.  The New York-based company had pre-ordered 28,000 to 56,000 mining rigs from Bitfury at a maximum price of $6,250 per machine, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission from October. At maximum values, that brings the order total to $350 million.  ""Given our belief that upcoming market conditions may warrant a premium on flexibility, we have decided to continue to push forward with our Bitmain and MicroBT contracts, but not Bitfury rigs for 2022 delivery,"" Page said.  The miner's projected hashrate will take a hit, but the company will be ""nimble and potentially capture opportunities in a fast-moving market,"" Page said. Given volatile market conditions and a shifting global landscape, cost discipline is vital, he said.  With the Bitmain and MicroBT purchases, the company plans to have 7.2 exahash/second (EH/s) by year-end. It is under contract to buy 60,000 rigs from Bitmain and 27,000 from MicroBT, Page said on the call.  The company may buy Bitfury machines in the future. The contract is ""a seven-year arrangement that provides flexibility given that we have a right of first refusal on machines,"" and a most favored pricing arrangement, Page said during the call. When rigs are in high demand or hard to source, Cipher Mining can exercise its option to buy rigs from Bitfury at a competitive price, Page said.  If market conditions are such that the miner can buy rigs at ""attractive prices"" later this year, it expects to have the capacity to grow its hashrate by an additional 1.9 EH/s by the end of the year.  Because of the decision to do away with Bitfury rigs, Cipher Mining's price per terahash has increased 10%-11%, a Wells Fargo analyst said during the call. Page said the flexibility it gives is important given that macro and industry factors are in flux. Cipher will be paying $42.81 per terahash/second, according to the presentation.  In February, Cipher Mining commenced mining at a 40 megawatt (MW) site that is 100% powered by wind energy, according to the investor presentation. It signed a back-to-back purchasing power agreement with a wind farm, and doesn't have a grid connection, meaning it cannot sell excess power back to the grid, the CEO said. Cipher Mining also signed a non-binding term sheet for a 200MW site with Luminant, a subsidiary of New York-listed Vistra (VST), including a 15-year deal of energy supply, according to the presentation.  The miner has yet to book revenue from bitcoin (BTC) mined, and instead reported a $72 million net loss for the 11 months ending Dec. 31, 2021.  Cipher Mining expects to spend $0.0273 per kilowatt hour for the next five years, the investor presentation said.

42421651,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXotSv,1646404452,The Game Is On: The Hunt for Web 3 Gaming Models,"Web 3 gaming, or GameFi, has transformed the crypto world, accounting for 49% of the industry’s blockchain usage. More than 1.4 million unique active wallets interacted with blockchain games in 2021, and venture capitalists have invested over $4 billion in GameFi.  The growth of NFTs (non-fungible tokens) last year accelerated the development of GameFi. The Blockchain Game Report 2021 from DappRadar highlighted that “gaming” NFTs had over $4.5 billion in trading volume and accounted for 20% of the total NFT sales in 2021. Much of that was triggered by the skyrocketing growth of play-to-earn (P2E) tokens, especially from one game – Axie Infinity.  But subsequent backlash and cratering token economies have changed the way players, developers and investors view this nascent industry. And yet P2E isn’t a flash in the pan based on one successful game, but a potential avenue for the deployment and development of many new tokenomic models that bridge the gap between in-game experiences and economic incentives. The search for new models is on.  Axie Infinity, the catalyst  Axie Infinity, which is built on the Ethereum blockchain, saw the price of its AXS token rise exponentially by 31,500% in 2021. Axie was the first game to demonstrate an innovative tokenomics model within games and provide great economic incentives to the masses.  Its model had two sets of tokens that accrued value differently. The AXS token was the governance token, whereas the SLP token was distributed as in-game rewards. The SLP tokens could be sold on exchanges or used to breed new cute digital creatures. Breeding Axies required both tokens and created NFTs that could be sold on NFT marketplaces. This multi-token economy and their interaction created a revolutionary economic model around the game.  See also: Three Definitions of Tokenomics | Opinion  The game’s popularity, however, put extreme pressure on its tokenomics. The rate at which SLPs were created was five times more than their “burning” ratio, or the rate at which they were removed from circulation. That resulted in a steep fall in the price of SLP tokens, making the entire game unattractive for users. You could play the game only after purchasing thousands of dollars’ worth of NFTs.  Still, the $3 billion market cap of Axie infinity and its staggering $1.2 billion in annualized revenue signaled a huge opportunity in P2E games. Axie Infinity’s valuation has both intrigued and repulsed gamers and companies in the traditional gaming industry.  The gaming sector responds to GameFi  Building on Axie’s popularity, leading global gaming studio Ubisoft announced Ubisoft Quartz, a platform for collecting and trading gaming NFTs. The backlash from gamers in its community, however, was immense, and the project died a silent death. Gamers were repulsed by the blatant revenue grab of an NFT model, which added little to the overall game experience.  Early last month, Axie’s SLP price crashed, creating concern about the sustainability of the game’s tokenomics model. Based on our interviews, there appears to be widespread belief among developers in Web 3 gaming that Axie’s P2E model may not be sustainable.  Roby John, the founder of SuperGaming, one of India’s largest gaming studios, stated bluntly that “present crypto tokenomics models look more like MLM (multi-level marketing) or pyramid schemes. If the number of users remains low or static, the entire model collapses”.  While this has done little to dull the enthusiasm around GameFi, it has sent serious developers on a quest for new tokenomics models. Shreyansh Singh, head of Polygon Studios, believes the potential for GameFi to create an entire financial ecosystem around gaming, including microloans for in-game assets, is immense. But that will take models developed from scratch.  “The Web 2.0 ecosystem is not experienced with tokenomics, and the Web 3.0 ecosystem is not experienced with game development,” he said.  The hunt for new GameFi models  Multiple models are being tested. Ish Goel of Web 3 game PlotX believes that skill-based P2E games will see huge adoption. He is gamifying prediction markets with a P2E token and has seen good adoption in his initial rollout.  Both value accrual and value destruction become important in new generation gaming tokenomics, according to Vish. He believes Star Atlas on the Solana blockchain appears to capture an economics model similar to the real world. By creating a strategic and expansive metaverse play with incentives to build cities, warships and so forth, it mimics models of land development and price appreciation that we see in the real world.  See also: Why India Isn't Buying NFTs (Yet) | Opinion  Last month, Siddhart Menon, a co-founder of WazirX, an Indian crypto exchange, and SuperGaming’s John announced the launch of Tegro Games. Siddharth revealed their plans in building a sustainable gaming model through effective categorization of Web 2.0 and 3 elements.  Tegro has classified Web 3 gaming models into four generations with a combination of NFT and fungible token plays. Gen 0 comprises pure NFT plays for games with low trade frequency. Gen 1 is designed for higher liquidity and a combination of fungible and non-fungible plays. Gen 2 is built for predictable supply and long-term liquidity. Gen 3 is a pure P2E play akin to a service economy or job economy. Finally, Gen 4 relates to economic governance.  “We are now at a tipping point where every major gaming title has a Web 3 strategy in place. However, most will start off at pure NFT plays, which isn’t something that protects players sustainably,” Menon said.  The search is on for tokenomics models that will find that a sweet spot between in-game experiences and economic incentives. With the time it takes to develop a game, we can expect a variety of GameFi models to hit the market within the next 18 months.",NEUTRAL,AXS,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Tanvi Ratna,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/03/04/the-game-is-on-the-hunt-for-web-3-gaming-models,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d689342afc8d21c0822fa7f7c2bfe8e545f4a36a-2400x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The upgrade introduces smart contract-to-contract calling, which allows applications to efficiently and trustlessly interact with other smart contract-based products. ""Calling"" refers to a smart contract function that returns the hash of the transaction that will be mined into the blockchain. Such functions can be executed by anyone, any time for any reason.  Previously, smart contracts on Algorand could be called only by a developer manually storing data in each contract’s local state, a tedious and difficult process. This upgrade, announced Thursday, allows a contract to automatically call another one directly.  The development follows a $20 million incentive program from the Algorand Foundation focused on developer tooling and compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). That is a virtual computer accessible anywhere in the world through participating Ethereum nodes.  “The power and composability of Algorand’s smart contract platform have transformed in recent months,” noted Paul Riegle, the company's chief product officer. “Developers are building versatile decentralized applications that have and will continue to disrupt a wide variety of industries,”  A core feature of the upgrade is the introduction of Falcon Keys. These keys will, in the near future, be used to generate State Proofs, a new blockchain infrastructure allowing Algorand to be trustlessly accessed in low-power environments like mobile phones and smartwatches as well as on other blockchains.",POSITIVE,없음,ALGO | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/03/04/algorand-upgrade-set-to-allow-for-easy-creation-of-complex-dapps,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5cc80e10d2d5764ce40a18a63a3f5ea059910d89-6212x4141.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The February jobs report from the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics was being monitored by crypto traders in case the data might affect the Federal Reserve's efforts to contain soaring inflation. A hot labor market can lead to faster wage increases, which can fuel inflation if businesses try to pass along their higher personnel costs to consumers.  Bitcoin (BTC) is seen by some investors as a hedge against inflation, but it often trades more like a risky asset, similar to stocks, with prices under pressure this year as the Fed moved to raise interest rates to help slow the rise in consumer prices.  Nonfarm payrolls increased by 678,000, the Bureau of Labor of Statistics reported Friday.  The unemployment rate edged down to 3.8%, from 4% in January. That's nearing the pre-pandemic level of 3.5% in February 2020.  Economists surveyed by Reuters had projected, on average, a gain of 400,000 jobs during the month.  Average hourly earnings of all employees on private nonfarm payrolls were $31.58, little changed from the prior month. The year-over-year increase worked out to 5.1%, versus expectations for 5.7%.

Sign up here to get it in your inbox each weekday morning.  Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Bitcoin eyes U.S. nonfarm payrolls and wage growth data. Options market continues to lean bearish.  Featured stories: Fed tightening may see emerging market investors buy bitcoin.  And check out the CoinDesk TV show ""First Mover,"" hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9 a.m. U.S. Eastern time. Today's show will feature guests:  Michele Schneider, managing director, MarketGauge Group  Alona Shevchenko, founder, UkraineDAO  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  Bitcoin traded lower for the third straight day as risk aversion gripped markets on reports of Russian troops shelling a Ukrainian nuclear plant.  In traditional markets, investors ditched risky assets for the safe-haven U.S. dollar. The greenback rose to a 21-month high against a basket of major fiat currencies, including the euro, perhaps reflecting fears that the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war would have a relatively minor impact on the U.S. economy.  The immediate prospects for the risk assets looked bleak, with the U.S. nonfarm payrolls data due for release at 13:30 UTC expected to show the jobs market continued to tighten in February, pushing wages higher. Rising wages are inflationary and would validate the Federal Reserve's hawkish stance.  Economists on average estimated that nonfarm payrolls probably rose by 400,000 in February, according to Reuters.  ""I think a strong NFP would revive calls for a more aggressive Fed and trigger another bout of risk aversion - crypto won't be spared,"" Ilan Solot, a partner at the Tagus Capital Multi-Strategy Fund, said in a Telegram chat.  ""It's also important to watch the shape of the Treasury yield curve. I think a bear steepening of the curve - where 10-year yields rise faster than the 2-year yields would spook the markets,"" Solot added.  Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader from Blofin, a crypto-asset management company, said the nonfarm payrolls release could be a nonevent and the focus now is on the next week's European Central Bank (ECB) meeting.  ""The impact of the nonfarm payrolls data on the crypto market will not be huge. The interest rate market has already priced in as many as six rate hikes, and the crypto market is only pricing in more. At present, we already know that the Fed will raise interest rates, so no matter how the U.S. market changes, this thing will happen,"" Ardern said in a Telegram chat.  ""The most considerable influence at the moment may be the hawkishness of the European Central Bank this week. Next week, the ECB will announce its interest rate decision. We can't yet tell what steps the ECB will take to reduce liquidity, and the crypto market doesn't seem to be pricing in it,"" Ardern noted, adding that, ""any unexpected move by the ECB could trigger a fall in the market.""  Options market continues to lean bearish  Bitcoin's options market continued to show bearish bias, with put-call skews entrenched in the positive territory.  Put-call skews measure the price of put options or relative bets relative to call options. The continued demand for downside hedges indicates lack of confidence in the sustainability of bitcoin's recent recovery from $34,500.  The one-week, one-, three- and six-month metrics crossed above zero, in the last week of January and have remained above the neutral line ever since in a sign of persistent fears of a deeper decline.  ""Positioning in crypto rarely remains for an extended period of time, but this is probably been one of the longest stretches of consistently high skew we've ever seen in crypto,"" Split Capital's Zaheer Ebtikar tweeted. ""It's a complete flip from the market regime even a year ago and can't be understated.""

""The institutions are coming. Bitcoin held by funds and ETFs just made an all-time high,"" Charlie Morris, chief investment officer at ByteTree Asset Management, tweeted early Friday.  Data tracked byhttps://bytetreeam.com/bitcoin-flows ByteTree shows the number of coins held by the U.S. and Canadian closed-ended funds and Canadian and European exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has reached a record high of 851,841 BTC – an increase of nearly 10,000 BTC in four weeks  Arcane Research's study, which filters out close-ended funds, shows bitcoin held by Canadian, U.S. and Brazilian ETFs registered inflows last month. While the European exchange-traded products and ETFs bled money for the third straight month, the outflows were substantially smaller than preceding months.  According to observers, the European funds saw outflows most likely due to increasing competition among providers of bitcoin-focused products and do not necessarily indicate weak demand.  ""I think the European Union (EU) is mostly bleeding at the moment due to two separate reasons: 1) Increased 'supply' of ETP products globally. More alternatives, competing in fee structures lead funds to move elsewhere. 2) Some of the EU ETPs are old, dating back to 2015, and thus follow a different structure,"" Vetle Lunde, market analyst at Arcane Research, said in a Twitter chat.  ""Most of the largest EU ETPs are certificate trackers, with no possibility of BTC redemption. In the last year, this has changed. Internally in the EU bunch, we see that trackers are the ones losing the most AUM, while physical ETPs are seeing net inflows.

According to Yamani Hafez, digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are not acceptable as &apos;payment instruments&apos; since they lack &apos;characteristics of money.&apos; His justification about digital assets not being a store of value or a good medium to exchange points towards the state of digital assets that are highly exposed to volatility.

42423710,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2ecnh,1646395774,Coinbase Says Crypto Markets Resilient After Russian Invasion of Ukraine,"Crypto markets have been reasonably resilient following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, however it will be difficult to sustain the current performance given the shock to the broader global financial system, Coinbase said in a report on Thursday.  The key performance drivers for the crypto markets became “more entangled” in February, as the escalation of geopolitical tensions has created more uncertainty regarding the possible normalization path to be taken by the U.S. Federal Reserve, said David Duong, Coinbase's head of institutional research.  De-risking in the months before the attack and the rapid escalation of the Ukraine conflict led to massive liquidations that forced crypto markets to reach a bottom sooner than expected, Coinbase said.  This coupled with the view that the starts of such large-scale conflicts tend to be buying opportunities and the belief that it would be a relatively short-lived conflict have all contributed to the resilience, the note adds.  These events may have convinced investors that global central banks would take a less aggressive approach to interest rate hikes, the report says.  Crypto markets have enjoyed a short-term reprieve, but Coinbase said this was due to technical reasons, adding that “positioning has helped crypto markets retrace, but we think they remain in an unstable equilibrium.”  The exchange’s medium-term outlook is that the broader market needs more time to stabilize before it can start to perform, which may happen towards the end of the second quarter.  Prior to the invasion, a quicker recovery was expected, but investors will now likely need more clarity around the timing of peak inflation and the Fed’s rate hike cycle before they are willing to deploy more capital, the note adds.

The subscription economy has experienced rapid growth over the past several years, but while many services exist to help Web 2 companies process payments and subscriptions, Diagonal says Web 3 companies are mostly left fending for themselves.  Collecting subscriptions in a decentralized fashion is not trivial, and if implemented sloppily can lead to companies and customers unnecessarily paying extra fees.  Diagonal CEO Tony Rosler told CoinDesk that his team’s goal is to provide Web 3 merchants “an entire product suite to make payments as simple as possible,” from connecting wallets and processing payments to handling accounting and sending subscription notifications to customers.  Rosler said MetaCartel Ventures, The LAO, Coinbase Ventures and other investment firms joined the funding round; angel investors Ryan Selkis, Anthony Sassano and others were also involved.  Diagonal’s team is working on developing a public beta, which they plan to initially release on Ethereum layer 2 blockchains Polygon, Arbitrum and Optimism.  Diagonal’s service is based on infrastructure from Superfluid, whose tools enable Ethereum-based apps to initiate streams of payment between parties that settle instantaneously with limited transaction, or ""gas,"" fees.

The questions centered on ViaWallet&apos;s project ideas, unique features, security level, future development and partnership. Here are some of the questions asked during the session along with in-depth responses provided by the organizers. Overview 1. Can you briefly explain the main idea/purpose behind the ViaWallet project? ViaWallet is mainly designed to meet the demand for asset management. Right now, you can trade and store (short-term) crypto assets in any crypto exchange. Yet, we believe that the specialized storage and management of cryptos also matter, and there is strong demand for such functions, which is why we decided to launch ViaWallet. Compared to a crypto exchange, ViaWallet focuses more on the storage and management of assets. More importantly, the application is safer and meets the demand for asset security and management. The upgrades of ViaWallet have also been centered on such demands. To meet the demand for the management of different assets, ViaWallet rolled out a multi-chain/multi-crypto model. In ViaWallet, both the single-crypto wallet and the multi-crypto wallet are available.

With as much as 150 million tokens being burned in a single transaction, the total number of 213 million tokens burned is the highest amount of tokens taken out of circulation for good in a single day this year. Let&apos;s try to put this in perspective. 19,359,317 $SHIB tokens were burnt the day before. This suggests that the burning rate has increased by 905.73 percent in the last 24 hours. This means that almost 9 times more tokens were burned today than yesterday. How Were the Shiba Inu Tokens Burnt? To burn $SHIB tokens, they must be transferred to inactive or inaccessible wallet addresses in order to be removed from circulation. As soon as these tokens are sent to a burn address, they are forever gone. In effect, burning the tokens decreases the number of tokens, which in turn increases the scarcity. This scarcity may lead to an increase in the market price for the tokens. With trillions of $SHIB tokens in circulating supply, burning helps to reduce the overall supply, which in turn helps to increase the value of the tokens that are still in circulation. In the month of February alone, 252 transactions resulted in the burning of 1.49 billion $SHIB tokens.

The Stochastic RSI shows a bearish crossover The 24-hour trading volume in the Enjin token is $126 Million, indicating an 18% fall. Past Performance of ENJ ENJ price continues the lower high formation under the highly bearish resistance trendline that influences the ongoing downtrend. The recent reversal from the confluence of the resistance trendline and the $1.6 barrier shows a downtrend continuation with multiple bearish candles. Thus, the falling prices indicate a rise in bearish momentum. Source-Tradingview ENJ Technical Analysis ENJ prices may shortly surpass the previous bullish candle and undermine the buyers at $1.35. However, the descending support trendline creates a wedge pattern that can result in a bullish reversal. The EMAs are crucial for the daily trading project to be in bearish alignment with a negative slope. Hence, the resistance trendline breakout will face multiple barriers in the form of 50, 100, and 200-day EMAs. The Stochastic RSI indicator shows an end to the bull cycle as the K and D lines give a bearish crossover near the overbought boundary. Hence, a downward continuation will increase the chances of a $1 fallout.

42375204,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw6K5J,1646390136,Bitcoin Slips Under $42K While Active Supply Reaches Yearly High,"Bitcoin (BTC) slid to below $41,500 during the morning hours in Europe on Friday as geopolitical tension in Eastern Europe worsened. The move followed a pullback in global markets after a building at a Ukrainian nuclear power plant briefly caught fire on Thursday night.  The euro slipped against the U.S. dollar, and the Stoxx Europe 600 equity index fell more than 2% on Friday, heading toward its worst week since March 2020. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 1.7%, while futures on Nasdaq 100 dropped 0.8%. The Russian stock market was closed for a fifth straight day.  Even so, bitcoin can be viewed as a safeguard asset for investors. The cryptocurrency traded at a 40% premium in Russia earlier this week as Russians looked for a way to preserve value amid sanctions, crypto research firm Delphi Digital said in a daily note.  Supply of “active” bitcoin, or the amount of bitcoin moving between addresses in a 24-hour period, soared to around 565,000 bitcoin.  “This is the highest level seen in over a year. In fact, only 2 events have seen higher activity: Black Thursday in March 2020 and in May 2020” Delphi analysts said in a note. “The supply of bitcoin held by smaller addresses (0.001 – 10 BTC) saw a steep uptick, which could be a result of capital flight from the ruble to bitcoin.”  Some analysts see bitcoin prices moving upward, despite recent volatility in broader markets.  Alex Kuptsikevich, an analyst at FxPro, said in an email to CoinDesk that the recent drop in markets came in anticipation that the U.S. Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policies that were put in place after the coronavirus outbreak in early 2020.  “The momentum of pressure on the crypto market was due to the decline in stock indices, as the Fed gave signals of tightening policy,” Kuptsikevich said. “Technical factors also contributed to the negative dynamics – the inability to overcome the strong resistance of the 100-day moving average and mid-February highs around $45,000.”  Meanwhile, Nigel Green, CEO of financial services firm deVere Group, said in a note to clients earlier this week that bitcoin could reach $50,000 by the end of March.  “The Ukraine-Russia situation has caused significant financial upheaval and individuals, businesses and indeed government agencies – not just in the region but globally – are looking for alternatives to traditional systems,” Green said.  ""Alternatives, such as crypto, prove to be credible and workable … savvy investors know this and will be further increasing their exposure to cryptocurrencies before prices rise further,” he added.  U.S. authorities have called on crypto exchanges to prevent Russia from circumventing sanctions. Meanwhile, the Bank of Russia hasn't softened its antipathy toward bitcoin and still advocates a complete ban on the circulation and mining of cryptocurrencies.

42375188,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw6Jox,1646384301,"Bitcoin Drops for Third Straight Day as Dollar Hits 21-Month High, US Wages Eyed","Bitcoin (BTC) fell for the third straight day on Friday as lingering geopolitical tensions and rising oil prices pushed the U.S. dollar higher.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value was trading at $41,400 during the early European session, representing a 2.5% drop on the day. Sellers regained dominance after the cryptocurrency failed to establish a foothold above $45,000 earlier this week.  ""Asian desks and high frequencies are cutting exposure on BTC while long only funds in European are selling. Brokers are also selling on behalf of clients more than usual as sentiment leaning slightly more bearish at the moment,"" Laurent Kssis, a crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) expert and director of CEC Capital, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.  The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against majors, jumped to 98.08, the highest since June 2020, according to a chart provided by TradingView.  The haven bid for the greenback strengthened during Asian hours triggered by a flight to safety as Russian forces started shelling Europe's largest nuclear power station in Ukraine. Asian stocks tanked to a 16-month low while oil remained in demand above $110 per barrel on both sides of the Atlantic.  Assets priced or traded in dollars typically drop when the dollar rises. According to Kevin Kelly, co-founder and global head of macro strategy at Delphi Digital, the greenback and bitcoin have a pretty inverse correlation.  ""2017 was one of the worst years for the dollar, and that coincided with a huge run in bitcoin,"" Kelly said in the latest weekly analyst call. ""We saw bitcoin run-up in early 2021. That was on the back of the dollar weakness.""  The U.S. Labor Department's closely watched employment report is scheduled for release at 13:30 UTC (8:30 a.m. ET). The report is expected to show that average average hourly earnings rose another 0.5% in February, pushing the year-over-year gain to 5.8%, according to Bloomberg. The non-farm payrolls (NFP) figure is likely to show the economy added 415,000 jobs, pushing the unemployment rate down to 3.9% from 4%.  Focus on wage growth  While the NFP may grab headlines, the market is likely to move more on the wage growth represented by average hourly earnings.  An above-forecast wage growth may bolster inflation worries, validating the U.S. Federal Reserve's hawkish stance. The dollar may find more buyers in that case, possibly bringing selling pressure to asset prices, including bitcoin.  According to macroeconomic theory, an uptick in wages can push up inflation. As wages rise, employers pass on the increase in labor cost to the final consumer, resulting in an uptick in the general price level in the economy. Workers demand higher wages in response, setting a vicious cycle of wage-push inflation in motion.  In recent months, the Fed has changed its stance to controlling price pressures from the dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment. U.S. inflation at the consumer level has risen to a four-decade with the ongoing Russia-Ukraine military conflict is likely to put further upward pressure on the general price levels.  On Thursday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers that the central bank is poised to raise rates by 25 basis points later this month and that they are prepared to do whatever it takes to control inflation, even at the expense of the economy, according to The New York Times. Markets expect the central bank to deliver five quarter percentage point rate hikes within the year.

But how do people get early access to NFT launches, and how can you get whitelisted for them?

In this short guide, we will cover what an NFT whitelist is, the benefits, and how you can get exclusive access to the world&apos;s best artists and creators, one-of-a-kind experiences, and curated drops.

Yield farming, staking and lending earned many cryptocurrency investors annual interest rates in double- and even triple-digit territory. Unheard of in traditional finance! But with high returns, investors faced high risks too. Numerous exploits of smart contracts where user funds were drained and malicious activity of DeFi protocols that suddenly withdrew large amounts of cryptocurrency resulted in a healthy amount of skepticism. Also, DeFi moved backstage since speculation around NFTs became a lucrative investment alternative, allowing investors to achieve immense multipliers by flipping JPEGs. But whilst the focus of crypto enthusiasts has shifted towards NFTs, DeFi has developed into a broader &apos;Web3&apos; movement. Providers like Bancor continuously developed their protocols to provide a safer environment for stakeholders. Others, like Ocean Protocol, improved and implemented DeFi infrastructure to disrupt multi-trillion-dollar industries. Bottom line, the foundation is set and DeFi may just be on the verge of taking the center stage again to push the broader cryptocurrency market capitalization to new all-time highs.

The president of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro, announced the new monthly minimum wage of 126 Venezuelan bolivars ($28). This represents a 18-fold increase to the national minimum wage, which would be 50% pegged to petro, the government cryptocurrency.  At the time of writing, the Venezuelan government did not immediately respond to request for further details.  Petro is built on top of the DASH blockchain and is centralized around government issuance, making it more like a central bank digital currency (CBDC) than a cryptocurrency.  Not much is known about the petro because its advertised block explorer is inaccessible. While the WayBack internet archive shows something that looked like a block explorer available in April 2020, the page has been blank ever since.  In theory, it is possible to purchase PTR with bitcoin (BTC) and litecoin (LTC) from either the Venezuelan central bank or local exchanges, however the prices vary wildly between the central bank rate and private exchange rate.  According to reports, most Venezuelans do not use PTR by choice rather out of necessity. For instance, pension payments are made in PTR.  It is also illegal for U.S. residents to hold or trade PTR due to sanctions imposed by the previous U.S. administration under Donald Trump.

42375203,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw6K43,1646363546,Crypto Industry’s Sanctions Woes on Full Display in MetaMask’s Venezuela Hiccup,"Crypto observers cried foul Thursday when reports surfaced on Reddit that MetaMask, the gateway for many to the world of Ethereum, was made inaccessible to users in Venezuela.  The truth of the matter, however, was that Infura, the infrastructure service also owned by Ethereum conglomerate ConsenSys, had imposed new geoblocks Thursday but applied them too broadly, according to a series of tweets.  The mistake had been rectified, Infura said, but not before critics levied claims that the episode revealed a point of failure in what is widely billed as the “uncensorable” internet.  “Infura closely monitors changes to U.S. sanctions programs announced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control and narrowly tailors its internal controls to comply with the law,” a ConsenSys spokesperson told CoinDesk via email. “Currently, those regions are Iran, North Korea, Cuba, Syria, and the Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk regions of Ukraine.”  Infura’s blockade of these regions comes as regulators ramp up intense scrutiny of the crypto industry’s compliance with sanctions imposed by U.S. and other national authorities against Russian entities. Regulators and lawmakers like U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren and German Finance Minister Christian Lindner have said they’re concerned crypto could be a tool used to undermine sanctions. Industry participants such as exchanges have said they will block sanctioned individuals, but for the most part they have not blocked entire nations outright.  MetaMask accesses the Ethereum blockchain through Infura by design. Unless altered by users, MetaMask’s default endpoints make it subject to Infura’s geographic no-go zones.  Read more: MetaMask, Infura Block ‘Certain Areas’ Amid Crypto Sanctions Fury  Crypto Twitter was reminded of that reality Thursday after Infura mistakenly threw too wide a dragnet. Rumors swirled over a complete blockade to Venezuela; commentators alleged, incorrectly, that MetaMask had been barred in a country where crypto booms and where the U.S. has imposed long-standing but not absolute sanctions.  “In changing some configurations as a result of the new sanctions directives from the United States and other jurisdictions, we mistakenly configured the settings more broadly than they needed to be,” Infura said Thursday in a tweet.  Infra acknowledged the uproar, apologized for its “oversight” and said service had been restored to “inadvertently impacted regions,” though it did not name Venezuela. MetaMask parroted the apology in its own tweet explaining it relies on Infura for access to the blockchain.  “MetaMask is still a decentralized tool,” Kieran Daniels, CEO of crypto startup SmartDeFi told CoinDesk in a Twitter message. “It’s just their default connections aren’t.”  Users are able to set their own endpoints by going into app settings, MetaMask said in a tweet. It shared a guide on how to do so.  Sanctions season  Coming amid a global debate on crypto and sanctions, the episode highlighted the seemingly conflicting realities of running uncensorable financial services through centralized rails.  Companies like Infura provide crucial developer and infrastructure services to an array of Ethereum-based projects. But it’s also a U.S. company subject to federal law. When Infura implements restrictions as it did on Thursday, the ripple effects are felt far and wide.  “As a centralized entity, funded by investors like JPMorgan, infrastructure providers like Infura are subject to regulatory concerns,” Josh Neuroth, CEO of decentralized cloud services company Ankr said in a statement. “This over-reliance on centralized service providers goes against everything that Web 3 stands for and is meant to be – and represents a central point of failure that shouldn't exist in the first place.”  Ankr, Inc. is itself a U.S. company. When asked if this meant Ankr must also follow sanctions directives from the U.S. Treasury Department, Neuroth said yes – “but the team is working as quickly as possible toward transitioning to a protocol that exists in the network and isn't run by a company, but a DAO.""  The confusing chain of events on Thursday was only made more so by a repeatedly updated “troubleshooting” page on MetaMask’s website. When CoinDesk first reported on this story that page was headlined “Why MetaMask and Infura cannot serve certain areas,” fueling speculation that MetaMask was itself implementing blocks.  A later update narrowed the headline to Infura.  “By default, MetaMask accesses the blockchain via Infura, which is unavailable in certain jurisdictions due to legal compliance,” the page read late Thursday. “When you attempt to use MetaMask in one of those regions,” users will receive an error message.  A chorus of commentators on Twitter insisted that the whole ordeal was proof that MetaMask was not quite as decentralized as they thought.  Left unsaid was the fact that Infura – and therefore MetaMask – have long followed OFAC sanctions guidance.  Crypto users in Iran, North Korea, Cuba and Syria were excluded well before those in parts of Ukraine.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/04/crypto-industrys-sanctions-woes-on-full-display-in-metamasks-venezuela-hiccup,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/65922fe80a5fdbd17136cb1da4e3b9cae1f4d75d-4000x2667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
