42384384,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAX2ZZ,1596825385,Money Reimagined: Warnings From an Argentine Tragedy,"I attribute my early interest in bitcoin to my six years as a correspondent in Argentina.      The lesson I took from that country’s repeated financial meltdowns is that any fiat monetary system requires a bedrock of trust in the nation’s governing institutions. When people don’t trust their government, the system is always prone to collapse.      It wasn’t until I discovered bitcoin, four years after my 2009 departure from Buenos Aires, that I understood this clearly. I’d been well aware of Argentines’ lack of trust in government – the local commentariat endlessly talked of their leaders’ corruption. But only after learning of how bitcoin’s decentralized cryptographic protocol allowed users to transact without having to trust centralized intermediaries did I see the connection between that trust deficit and Argentina’s financial dysfunction.      You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.      Argentina is by no means alone in this problem. But as its government finalizes yet another bond restructuring deal with investors, this time to write down $65 billion in foreign debt, and with its perpetually volatile economy facing its worst contraction ever, it’s worth exploring this more deeply.      Now, more than ever, Argentina’s failures offer a cautionary tale, especially for the U.S. And with speculation growing over changes to the global financial system, cryptocurrency and blockchain models could help us design systems more resilient to this kind of failure.      Note, this is not a “bitcoin fixes this” essay. Believing that bitcoin alone will save all Argentines – or Turks, Venezuelans or Filipinos – is, as Coinshares Chief Strategy Officer Meltem Demirors noted this week, naive and offensive. This hard-to-use technology is no silver bullet for the root causes of economic destitution.      Nonetheless, bitcoin’s decentralized blockchain-based system for exchange and record-keeping is a valuable frame of reference for assessing existing monetary governance and for thinking about alternatives. To paraphrase Marc Hochstein, CoinDesk’s executive editor (and last week’s replacement author of this newsletter), “blockchain doesn’t have all the answers, but it asks the right questions.”    The untrustworthy sovereign    To understand how Argentina’s financial system failed and the potential of a decentralized alternative, we must first review the history of money itself, the power structures it fosters, and the friction it creates.      For the past 5,000 years, money has been closely associated with the idea of “the sovereign,” by which we essentially mean “the ruler.” Different communities have used different currencies – from wampum in the early American colonies to cigarettes in prisons – but it’s the ones issued by monarchs and state governments that dominate. That’s because of the sovereign’s unique power to mandate which currencies are legal tender and accepted in payment of taxes.      In the 20th century, as the nation-state became entrenched as the core realm of political power, national governments cemented their quasi-monopolies as issuers of legal tender currencies. This was done in coordination with banks, to which they granted exclusive access to central bank reserves, treating them as agents for generating, distributing and circulating money.      But while governments and their agent bankers could guarantee their currency’s dominance, they couldn’t control its value among users, who always found ways to sell an unwanted national currency for something of more lasting value: gold, or foreign currencies, or goods they’d stockpile before inflation eroded their purchasing power. They would seek fiat alternatives when governments exploited their unique currency-issuing powers to pursue their own self interests.      Rigidly fixed currency regimes, such as the gold standard or Argentina’s 1990s dollar-pegged currency board, offer some protection against that risk. They’re intended as a policy straitjacket to prevent a government from abusing its citizens’ trust.      Yet, the state’s power ultimately supersedes this straitjacket, as President Richard Nixon demonstrated by abandoning the dollar’s gold peg in 1971 and as Argentine President Eduardo Duhalde did by ending the Argentine peso’s dollar peg in 2001. Sovereign power is absolute.    Let’s learn from Argentina’s tragedy to design a universal system that crowns the 'sovereign self.'    At the end of the day, a currency’s viability hinges on the degree of trust people hold in their government. One could argue the United States’ relatively solid economic performance since 1971 and Argentina’s disastrous experiences over the same period reflect the comparative degree of institutional trust in each country’s system of government. (One could also argue the distinction between the two countries has narrowed dramatically in recent times.)      In Argentina, the trust breakdown manifests as financial and economic volatility, much like anywhere else that’s prone to such boom-bust cycles.      Such countries’ financial systems serve the interests of speculators, not their people. Short-sellers swarm in to sell stocks and bonds during a downturn, prompting governments to take drastic measures to stem the outflow of funds – such as the many times Argentina has limited bank withdrawals and transfers in failed bids to protect the peso, only to paralyze its payments system. Eventually, the country’s assets reach oversold levels – when a deal is done with bondholders, for example – which is when speculators return as “vulture funds” buying “distressed debt” to ride the inevitable rebound. It’s a dirty game, but they’re not the root of the problem. This system stems from an original sin: the government’s breach of its people’s trust.    The sovereign self    Unlike many hard-money bitcoiners, I don’t think the answer to these problems is to impose a hard limit on money supply.      I’m not saying bitcoin isn’t valuable; on the contrary, its strict issuance regime gives it “digital gold” qualities that offer a powerful hedge against breaches of governmental trust. It’s just that deflationary currencies, as Argentina’s 1990s currency board showed, often serve solely the interests of savers. In times of economic contraction, economies need money that consumers and investors will put to work rather than HODL. (I see Crypto Twitter’s rage tweets coming at me already.)      What solution, then, do bitcoin and other blockchain solutions offer to the “Argentine problem?” It lies, I think, in their radical new model of governance, one that turns the trust problem over to an open-source algorithm whose rules are defined by a permissionless network, a system whose rules Nixon could never have overridden. It’s not, per se, that bitcoin’s rules project a fixed 21-million coin supply 100 years from now, but that the rules themselves – whatever the community agrees to – cannot be changed by a centralized power.      What we’re talking about is a different concept of “the sovereign.” This is about not having to trust Richard Nixon, Eduardo Duhalde, the Federal Reserve's Jerome Powell or Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan. It’s about empowering us to choose what currency or system we want for our wellbeing or to exchange value with others.      Whether we choose bitcoin, the dollar, gold, a stablecoin, or some other blockchain model, what most matters is the very freedom to choose. We need a system of choice that leaves those in power beholden to the choices of the individuals they deign to rule.      Amid so much discussion about the future of the financial system, with even Goldman Sachs questioning the future of the dollar’s hegemony, let’s learn from Argentina’s tragedy to design a universal system that crowns the “sovereign self.”    Privacy-positive performance    By Galen Moore, CoinDesk Senior Research Analyst      The world got a demonstration of bitcoin’s transparency recently, when a hacker took over the Twitter accounts of powerful individuals and companies, and used them to solicit bitcoin with a scam charity appeal. Crypto forensics experts and analysts, CoinDesk included, watched the hacker's funds, analyzing their sources and where they were transferred.      So-called privacy coins aim to shield crypto transactions from that kind of scrutiny. Three of them – dash, monero and zcash – feature in the CoinDesk 20, a list of assets that show consistent market impact via consecutive quarters of verifiable trading volume.      Bitcoin is the highest-volume asset in the CoinDesk 20 and the next-most heavily traded assets often exceed it in returns. This past week's run-up is no exception. The privacy coins are standouts, in that their volumes are often in the bottom half of the ranking, but two out of the three are in the top five by returns, year-to-date.      There's little evidence the Twitter hack drove particular interest in privacy coins, but so far in 2020, the three coins with a privacy value proposition have punched above their weight. CoinDesk Research’s July Review has more on privacy coin volatility and correlations. We’ll continue tracking these projects over the summer.    The global town hall    GOLDEN MOMENT. The crypto world got excited this week by a resurgence in bitcoin and ether prices. As we went to print, BTC was testing $12,000 with a shot at its levels not seen since the great boom-bust of 2017-2018, and ETH, following a massive run-up from a bottom around $80 in early May, was toying with $400 and trading at its loftiest level since this time two years ago. But for the “normies,” surely this week’s historic market story belonged to gold. The price of the precious metal reached its highest level ever this week, surpassing $2,000 per ounce.      This is a big deal, people. I’m no gold bug. I believe bitcoin is a better substitute for scarcity in the digital age and I think a functional currency should have malleability in its supply function, which neither bitcoin or gold offers. But, please, have some respect for gold. Its cultural value has lasted longer than any language, religion or ideology. It’s the ore from which kings through the ages minted their coins, the shiny substance that permeates our children’s fables, the alluring mineral that fueled the conquest of the Americas. There’s no magical meaning to the $2,000 level but let’s recognize the wisdom of the crowd that drove this run-up. Amid the most extreme downturn in the global economy for 90 years, and as confidence in the political leadership is being tested, the soaring value of an ancient commodity that serves as a hedge against political and financial dysfunction must give pause for thought. Is something about to break?      INDEX ≠ ECONOMY. Last week, the S&P 500 returned to a level showing a positive return year-to-date and got within 40 points of its record high in late-February before COVID-19 sent markets into a tailspin mid-March. This happened as news broke that the U.S. economy contracted by an annualized rate of 32.9 percent in the second quarter.      I feel like I should just end this item there. The juxtaposition is just so astounding. But we really should try to figure out how this could happen. Thankfully, Bloomberg contributor Barry Ritholtz has a column that lays out “Why Markets Don’t Seem to Care If the Economy Stinks.”His argument: market capitalization weightings within indexes such as the S&P are skewed toward a few key industries that are making an inordinate amount of money – especially technology – while those that reflect the COVID-devastated mainstream economy (e.g. retail and travel) occupy a tiny place within the indexes. He’s not arguing that things are great, but that we put too much meaning in indexes beyond the investment story they tell. Despite the habits of journalists over the decades, and despite the current U.S. president’s predilection for equating stock market rallies as a sign of economic strength, the experiences of Wall Street and Main Street are very divergent. That wouldn’t be a political issue per se, except that, in the current fiat system, the former absorbs far more benefit from monetary stimulus than the latter.      COVID COLLATERAL. Caitlin Long, founder of Avanti Bank and advocate for Wyoming as a blockchain jurisdiction, is everywhere these days. Here she is as the co-author of a recent paper published by the International Monetary Fund, along with Charles Kahn, Professor Emeritus at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and IMF senior economist Manmohan Singh. They focus on the payment system efficiencies that could arise from having capital that would otherwise be tied up in bank reserves and deposits used as collateral to back tradable crypto tokens. The bit that stands out: the idea that the trillions in dollars in reserves that central banks have created as a result of their COVID-19 stimulus efforts are now crying out for this kind of treatment.    Relevant reads    Goldman Sachs Eyes Token as Bank Appoints Head of Digital Assets.A couple of months ago, Goldman Sachs was out there pooh-poohing bitcoin, telling an investor call that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are not an asset class. Three months later and the Wall Street bellwether is taking a very much more nuanced position. It’s keen on the technology underlying cryptocurrencies and has hired a head of digital assets to explore a Goldman-issued token. Paddy Baker reports.      TikTok and the Great Firewall of America. Missing the forest for the trees.That’s the impression one gets of the Trump Administration’s attack on Chinese-owned TikTok from this piece by Global Macro and Policy Editor Emily Parker. With the U.S. government now banning the social sharing app and Tencent’s WeChat service, Parker calls out hypocrisy. Concerns about data abuses by the Chinese government ignore the fact that U.S. companies are exploiting our data every day.      ‘Crypto Instagram’ Is Becoming a Thing, Scams and All. If TikTok goes away in the U.S., expect many of that platform’s stars to migrate to Instagram. Be wary, though. As Leigh Cuen discovered, the Facebook-owned social media network is already a magnet for crypto scammers. It’s not just Twitter – fraudsters will thrive anywhere.      US Lawmakers Don’t Want Proof-of-Stake Networks to Get Overtaxed. With Ethereum 2.0 on the horizon, the business of token-staking is poised to get bigger. Inevitably, this hard-to-pigeonhole new means of earning crypto income will raise questions from lawyers on how it should be treated for tax purposes. As we’ve seen in past crypto developments, a lack of understanding in Congress runs the risk of prompting regulatory over-reaction. So it’s pleasing to see that, as Nikhilesh De reports, a group of crypto-savvy lawmakers are trying to get ahead of that and prevent the risk of overtaxing.      Social Engineering: A Plague on Crypto and Twitter, Unlikely to Stop. One silver lining to the massive Twitter hack last month is that it shed a light on how the real vulnerability in cybersecurity lies not with technology but with people. The crypto community is especially vulnerable, given the temptation that tokens represent to hackers. So, don’t miss this very useful explainer on these so-called social engineering attacks from Benjamin Powers and Nikhilesh De.      Fixing This Bitcoin-Killing Bug Will (Eventually) Require a Hard Fork. You might call it Bitcoin’s Y2K moment. Don’t worry, it won’t kick in until the year 2106, but this bug will kill the protocol if the community doesn’t agree to a hard fork in the code to fix it. But Alyssa Hertig’s great write-up of this particular problem is really valuable. It’s a great window into the challenges that open-source crypto communities face in coordinating hard forks and, specifically, into the issue of “protocol ossification” – the idea that the bigger the network becomes the harder it is to make code changes.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | FORKS,Michael J.

FedNow is being developed in response to private-sector, real-time, gross settlement initiatives. ""By creating that neutral platform, banks in partnership with these other companies will be able to offer much more innovation services, services that we may not even be imagining,"" Brainard said.      Banking Coins Sberbank, Russia’s biggest consumer bank, is launching a blockchain platform built on Hyperledger Fabric and mulling a stablecoin. The blockchain will be used for trade finance and potentially other existing lines of business. It’s an open system, with other banks or tech companies able to spin up nodes and build their own smart contracts. Anatoly Popov, Sberbank’s deputy chair, was quoted Wednesday saying the bank hopes to launch a ruble-backed stablecoin. The bank is waiting for a new digital assets law to come into force in January 2021, and after that will make the final decision. In similar news, Binance’s USD stablecoin has been green-lighted by New York’s financial watchdog for use by banks and other financial institutions.

(The Verge)  At stake    Thursday, Goldman Sachs announced it hired a new global head to oversee its growing digit assets division.      Mathew McDermott, an internal hire, told CNBC he envisions a world where the entire financial system resides on distributed ledgers. What’s more, he sees this happening within the next decade.      “In the next five to 10 years, you could see a financial system where all assets and liabilities are native to a blockchain, with all transactions natively happening on chain,” he said.      Tasked with preparing the bank for this imminent future, McDermott is doubling his team’s headcount and mulling the creation of the bank’s own “fiat digital token,” colloquially known as a stablecoin. He reportedly snagged one of JPMcoin’s architects from the rival firm.      While the news shows more than one Wall Street titan is thinking seriously about the commercial viability of blockchain, it’s also an inside look into the black boxes that banks have become.      ""The first thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs is that it's everywhere. The world's most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money,” Matt Taibbi wrote of the bank in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.      Just a few months ago, a leaked slidedeck showed Goldman analysts didn’t consider bitcoin and other cryptos investment grade. Now it seems the bellwether bank is keen on the underlying technology.      Goldman’s clients apparently ignored the bank’s own advice anyway. “We’ve definitely seen an uptick in interest across some of our institutional clients who are exploring how they can participate in this space,” McDermott said. “It definitely feels like there is a resurgence of interest in cryptocurrencies.”    Market intel    Ether Option The ether options market is bustling, with open interest approaching $400 million. “Open interest is now 2.5 times higher than it was just a few weeks ago, touching a new record,” noted Chris Thomas, head of digital assets for broker Swissquote. Approximately $351 million of this activity is on Netherlands-based platform Deribit. “There’s almost zero real institutional volume through these exchanges,” said Thomas. He indicated those using ether options are high-net-worth individuals or small cryptocurrency funds preparing for increased ETH volatility.    Tech pod    Not Baroque, Rococo Parity Technologies’ Polkadot has launched a testnet, Rococo, of the protocol’s first parachain specification, according to a blog Thursday. Parachains underlie Parity Tech’s vision of a “protocol for protocols.” The Proof-of-Authority (PoA) network will enable three parachains attached to a “Substrate,” or a building kit for other blockchains to interoperate as a Polkadot parachain. This is the first test of this inter-blockchain communication.    Op-ed    Patronage Over Parsimony Nic Carter, a CoinDesk columnist and partner at Castle Island Ventures, thinks Bitcoin’s unofficial and piecemeal system of funding developers is one of its strengths. “For those versed in the dynamics of open source, Bitcoin’s patronage system as a funding model should come as no surprise. Bitcoin works in ways that are not short-term expedient, but pay dividends in the final analysis. Of course, a protocol-derived pool of rewards with which to pay developers would have been much more convenient, but it would have completely undermined the political neutrality of the monetary system,” he writes.

Proposed in the California legislature earlier this year, the bill, A.B. 2004, would create verifiable health records on the blockchain that citizens show on entry into public buildings or public transportation to check whether they have or have had the coronavirus.  Per the bill's fact sheet, the idea is this would help slow the rate of infection and take people in the high-risk category out of harm's way.  But in an article Thursday, Adam Schwartz, EFF senior staff attorney, said putting any health records on a permanent ledger was a ""troubling step"" to a national identification system that could be used to track citizens.  The proposed system would mean everyday citizens would have to disclose their personal health records to unknown people who aren't necessarily medical professionals, Schwartz said.  He also said the system would unfairly affect those unable to afford regular testing – and therefore leave people marked as infected even if they no longer are.  Blockchain's immutability also means that false diagnoses would not be able to be erased, he added.  EFF has publicly opposed the bill since it was first proposed in May; the state Assembly bill was passed and moved to the California Senate in early June.  EFF has previously defended the right of a former employee at Kraken to post an anonymous review about the crypto exchange.

DeversiFi announced Friday that ParaFi and D1 had together invested $450,000, in tether tokens, in return for governance token nectar (NEC).  San Francisco-based ParaFi's portfolio includes other DeFi projects such as Aave, Curve, MakerDAO and Kyber Network, into which ParaFi invested in June.  D1 Ventures' previous investments include The Graph, Thorchain, Tellor and Nest Protocol.  Formerly Ethfinex, DeversiFi is a non-custodial exchange spun out of Bitfinex in 2019 and that re-released its trading platform with a newly built privacy layer earlier this year.  The exchange acts as a hybrid where trades are executed off-chain and settled on-chain in batches every hour; this means DeversiFi can settle 9,000 transactions every second.  ParaFi and D1 have committed to staking tokens in the platform's governance protocol necDAO, so they'll be able to play a role in the project's direction as they would with an equity stake.  DeversiFi co-founder Ross Middleton says there is currently 17,000 ether (around $6.7 million) pledged to the necDAO, most being trading fees collected from when it was Ethfinex.  Both funds will have a role in determining how these funds are spent – one current proposal is using ETH to connect necDAO to liquidity pools and allow it to earn a passive income.

Under a plan announced Friday, demo digital tokens will be given to participating businesses that cut their carbon footprint by powering electric van sharing, said Eduardo Javier Muñoz, CEO of EVShare, a startup that's now involved in the pilot through electric vehicle company Green Commuter. (EVShare is not a contractor with the California Energy Commission and the pilot is led by smart energy nonprofit Energy Coalition.) If the pilot goes into production, the credits can be used to pay for electricity consumption, rides and services in the future.    Mobility-related transactions will be recorded on the RSK blockchain, a smart contract-oriented platform that is similar to Ethereum but runs on top of the Bitcoin network. Transactions sent to a microgrid – a separate system from the city’s power grid – are being recorded by Community Electricityhttps://communityelectricity.io/about/ on the Energy Web Foundation’s blockchain.    The market is part of a $20 million initiative that will track data related to solar panels, energy storage, electric vehicles and charging infrastructure in Bassett, an unincorporated community in Los Angeles County. The commission’s previously disclosed $9 million grant will cover nearly half the cost; Google, UCLA and others are covering the remaining $11 million, according to EVShare.      Read more: RSK Launches Interoperability Bridge Between Bitcoin and Ethereum      The project aims to digitize carbon credit reporting, create opportunities for businesses to redeem credits and make electric vanpooling cheaper for Bassett residents, Muñoz said.      “Today, carbon credit trading is not digitized,” he said. “It’s a very unconventional market. … Now it will be easier to hold [credits] and trade them.”      It is rare for enterprise blockchain projects to use public networks, which are auditable by and open to all comers, instead of a private ledger restricted to authorized participants. Rarer still are enterprise experiments tied to Bitcoin; Ethereum has been the platform of choice for most corporates venturing into open-network territory.    Green mind    The Bassett initiative is the also latest attempt to streamline trading processes for carbon credits using blockchain record-keeping. In July, the InterWork Alliance announced that it was working on blockchain tools to prevent double-spending of carbon credits.      The RSK blockchain will also register transactions between vehicles and solar panels, batteries and chargers. Records of their usage will be stored on-chain with the help of RIF, an identity product developed by RSK Labs, the startup that created the chain. The electric vans will be operated by Green Commuter.      Phase 1 of the pilot included research and development, business collaboration and participation from the Bassett community. Phase 2, which the companies also announced Friday, will connect 50 houses to the solar grid over the course of two years, Muñoz said.      Read more: Carbon Credits Have a Double-Spend Problem. This Microsoft-Backed Project Is Trying to Fix It      Carbon credits permit companies to emit a certain amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Companies with unneeded carbon credits can sell them to other firms that emit more.      EVShare aims to help 1,000 cities transition to a sustainable sharing economy over the next decade. The firm plans to connect solar home-energy systems with shared electric vans operated by Green Commuter. Excess energy is sold to a microgrid or used by households.      UPDATE (July 7, 12:44 UTC): Because of inaccurate information initially provided by EVShare, an earlier version of this article incorrectly said the startup is leading the pilot; the nonprofit Energy Coalition is, both organizations confirmed.      The article has also been updated to clarify that the carbon credits are not actually redeemable, just demos; that the pilot is connected to a microgrid, not the city's power grid; that transactions on the microgrid will be recorded on a separate blockchain developed by Energy Web Foundation; and that Green Commuter is a contractor with the energy commission, not EVShare or RSK.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/08/07/california-agency-backs-green-energy-pilot-using-rsks-bitcoin-smart-contracts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4339e2cb3af405c59ff08e4cff023eef22a553fb-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384379,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAX2TH,1596804360,Fixing This Bitcoin-Killing Bug Will (Eventually) Require a Hard Fork,"Most of us will be dead by then.      Projected to happen in the year 2106, Bitcoin will suddenly stop running based on the code its network of users is running today. Users won't be able to send bitcoin to others; miners securing Bitcoin's global network will no longer serve a purpose. Bitcoin will just stop.      The good news is the bug is easy to fix. It's a problem Bitcoin developers have known about for years – since at least 2012, maybe earlier, according to Bitcoin Core contributor Pieter Wuille. To some developers, the Bitcoin bug potentially sheds light on the limits to Bitcoin's decentralization, since the community will all need to join together to fix it.      Read more: A Bitcoin Hard Fork? The Science of Contentious Code is Advancing      ""This is a consensus change but a very simple one, and I hope one that will be non-controversial,"" Blockstream co-founder and engineer Pieter Wuille told CoinDesk in an email. ""We have about 80 years left to address [the bug]. Who knows what might happen in such a time frame?""      The bug is simple. Bitcoin blocks are the containers within which transactions are stored. Each Bitcoin block has a number tracking how many blocks come before it. But because of a limitation revolving around how block height numbers are stored, Bitcoin will run out of block numbers after block number 5101541.      In other words, at a block height roughly 86 years into the future, it will be impossible to produce any new blocks.    Hard fork    The change requires what's known as a ""hard fork,"" the most demanding method of making a change to a blockchain. Hard forks are tricky in that they're not backwards-compatible, they require everyone running a Bitcoin node or miner to upgrade their software. Anyone who doesn't do so will be left behind on a stonewalled version of Bitcoin that's incapable of any activity.      While some blockchains, such as Ethereum, execute hard forks regularly, a hard fork isn't the happiest word in Bitcoin land.      The last time a Bitcoin hard fork was attempted, it attracted vicious debate. Several big Bitcoin businesses and miners rallied around a hard fork called Segwit2x in 2017. The problem is that far from everyone in the community agreed with the change, so many saw it as an attempt to force the upgrade on the community, which doesn't exactly jibe with Bitcoin's ethos of leaderlessness.      Read more: No Fork, No Fire: Segwit2x Nodes Stall Running Abandoned Bitcoin Code      Because of this diary entry in Bitcoin's history, when many people in Bitcoin hear the phrase ""hard fork,"" they think of a centralized power trying to impose a change.      However, this bug fix hard fork comes in stark contrast to Bitcoin's most famous hard fork attempt. Rather than attracting debate, the community and developers will most likely agree it is a change that needs to be made.      After all, anyone who chooses not to upgrade their software will eventually be running a dead Bitcoin chain.    Protocol 'ossification'    The bug fix is unlikely to be a controversial hard fork change. But that doesn't make the issue any less interesting.      In conversation with CoinDesk, Gustavo J. Flores, head of Product and Research at Bitcoin tech startup Veriphi, argued it brings to light a limit to Bitcoin's ""protocol ossification.""      Read more: Hard Fork vs Soft Fork      Bringing to mind squishy cartilage hardening into bone over time, protocol ossification is the idea that Bitcoin will grow harder to change as it matures. The first several years of Bitcoin's life, the protocol was immature and there were far fewer users and developers tinkering with the software, so the technology was easier to change. But Bitcoin may be hardening into a bony specimen that will be very difficult to change.      ""Protocol ossification means a certain point in time, some say it should be now, where Bitcoin doesn't change anymore. The rules are set such as a country's constitution would be set, unchangeable, since it would be too decentralized to coordinate any change,"" Flores told CoinDesk.    Just a dream?    The reason many Bitcoin technologists think ossification is a good quality is because it is a sign the system is actually as decentralized as the community wants it to be, ensuring the system is really free from one person or entity stepping in and pushing through a change that isn't good.      Flores added that protocol ossification helps to ""prevent future tentatives that would resemble Segwit2x, where some actors try to force an upgrade because they're known developers or big businesses, and this ends up hurting Bitcoin because it's either untested code or cryptography, or because the change removes the core value proposition or would decrease decentralization which would hurt the core value proposition over the long term.      ""However, this bug makes it desirable to be able to coordinate a hard fork to fix it, since we all want Bitcoin to be able to survive that deadline,"" Flores said.      ""It basically brings us back to reality, where the dream of protocol ossification (which makes us achieve ultimate decentralization) is a further than expected and it might be just a dream, which we can get closer over time, but we can't ever complete it since emergencies such as this, might present themselves,"" Flores told CoinDesk.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | FORKS,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/08/07/fixing-this-bitcoin-killing-bug-will-eventually-require-a-hard-fork,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f7672c2a2ce3e13e71d081c904065d71798c0366-1200x675.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42384365,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAX2JD,1596804140,Free Speech vs. Cancel Culture: Reasons for Optimism,"Jill Carlson, a CoinDesk columnist, is co-founder of the Open Money Initiative, a non-profit research organization working to guarantee the right to a free and open financial system. She is also an investor in early-stage startups with Slow Ventures. This op-ed is the second of two parts. See the first here.      Much has been made this summer of censorship. From protestors tearing down statues to streaming platforms removing television episodes, we have many reasons to consider the line between free speech and unacceptable bigotry and bias.      While many have welcomed this reconsideration, others have cried “cancel culture,” calling these moves a purge and comparing today’s society to that of “Fahrenheit 451.”      It’s worth remembering that purges of cultures, knowledge and society are not particular to our time. For almost 5,000 years of human history, civilizations around the world have engaged in destruction of their own and each others’ books, records and other forms of culture.      See also: Justin S. Wales - Why Bitcoin Is Protected by the First Amendment      This reminder is not meant to defend this type of destruction, but it should allow us to take a deep breath in the face of a dismantling of narrative and culture and recognize that, throughout history, societies and their cultures have persisted and resurged even in the face of such purges. Indeed, cultures have often been shaped and defined by such events. As I have argued before, tearing down statues is often not so much censorship as it is speech in and of itself.      Still, I also subscribe to the belief that wholesale removal of the artifacts of our history and culture might set a scary precedent for lovers of civil liberties and personal freedoms, particularly around speech and expression.      The total removal or destruction often does little in service of reshaping the future. If we blot out history, how will we ever learn from it?      There are alternatives to the complete removal of the artifacts, like adding context. This was done when Christopher Colombus’ bust was removed from public display in the streets of Haiti and placed in a museum. A more recent example is HBO’s decision to keep ""Gone With The Wind"" on its platform, but only with the addition of new material to address the film’s racist overtones. The ways available to us in reckoning with the past are more nuanced than the black and white of removal or preservation.    Deplatformed    We are reckoning with more than the past this summer. One cannot discuss the issues of censorship and free expression in 2020 without addressing the debate around social media platforms. In an era when everything is clickbait and fake news, the role of social media in providing not only a platform but, often, a megaphone has never been more important – nor under more scrutiny.      Perhaps no moment exemplified this more than when Donald Trump posted about the protests in Minneapolis: “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.”    We may wake up to find statues and social media posts gone from immediate view, but their content and context will be far from forgotten.    While Facebook left the post untouched, arguing people “should be able to see what politicians say,” Twitter hid the post behind context stating that the Tweet “violated the Twitter Rules about glorifying violence.” Notably, neither site fully removed the post, but, for those who are not President of the United States, the treatment is not always so lenient.      Deplatforming has not moderated speech or led to more facts than fictions, but rather driven extreme views to increasingly extreme corners of the web, whether on Mother Jones to the left, Quillette to the right or on social media challenger Gab even farther out the axis. As this suggests, perspectives, opinions, information, and theories are not easily stamped out. Mainstream social media platforms may drive this type of speech out of their own homes, but like cockroaches, this type of speech will simply move and live on.    Persistence and preservation    Returning to history, we find that artifacts of culture, even when intended to be destroyed, often find ways to live on as well. This preservation often occurs in unintended ways and in unexpected places. The destruction of the ancient Assyrian capital, Nineveh, in fire, for example, baked and hardened tens of thousands of clay tablets that might otherwise not have been preserved.      Similarly, while many mourn the destruction of the Library of Alexandria as a moment of massive cultural loss, few point to how a repository equivalent of the Library was preserved 250 miles south of Alexandria in the form of a trash heap. This monumental garbage dump was located in a town called Oxyrhynchus, a place whose dry, untouched sands pressed and perfectly preserved pieces of papyrus for over 2,000 years. The trash heap yielded many of the only known versions of ancient plays and poems, as well as fragments of religious texts important to our understanding of everything from the Greek gods to early interpretations of Christianity and Islam.      My point here is I do not currently fear that future generations will lose the content and context of the U.S. in 2020, even amid fears around deplatforming and censorship. For as long as they have existed, cultures have always evolved, and that evolution can most often be traced and understood in hindsight. Even today, as we see specific types of speech banned from certain platforms, we can witness the fact that those words generally do not disappear, but rather migrate to new sites.      This comfort is not one I take for granted. The persistence of this type of material is entirely dependent on the creation and continuation of projects like the Internet Archive, a non-profit digital library of all manner of media, including the preservation of past versions of significant websites. Yet, the Internet Archive is currently facing a digital rights lawsuit that threatens it’s very premise.      As such, I am even more optimistic about decentralized forms of preservation that will hopefully not face the same types of challenges over the long term. Projects like Sia’s Skynet – a decentralized file sharing system – are important steps in this direction. Even the use of bitcoin’s blockchain for purposes of preservation and timestamping is a valuable step towards creating truly persistent memory. See projects like OpenTimeStamps.      Finally, naturally, none of this is solved with technology alone. The work of organizations like the ACLU and the Electronic Frontier Foundation are hugely important and may represent the most important factor in the comfort I feel looking at the preservation of digital free speech in the U.S. relative to many other geographies.      See also: Decentralization and What Section 230 Really Means for Freedom of Speech      Even the more extreme social media challengers play an important role here. While I personally find many of the views expressed on platforms like Gab problematic or reprehensible, I can also acknowledge the very existence of such a forum provides some reassurance that we continue to live in a society that values free speech.      That said, I would welcome more experimentation with what these forums can look like. I am particularly intrigued by Twitter’s R&D to develop an open and decentralized standard for social media. Also in this category is Club P., the anonymous discussion board recently launched by Coin Center Director Jerry Brito.      These initiatives and organizations, for me, are cause for optimism around the future of free speech. But so are protestors tearing down statues and presidential tweets accompanied by disclaimers. If history is any example – and if technology, innovation and (importantly) our rule of law can be relied upon – we may wake up to find statues and social media posts gone from immediate view, but their content and context will be far from forgotten.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Jill Carlson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/08/07/free-speech-vs-cancel-culture-reasons-for-optimism,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fd216ad522fcc817890aa565e9ad92791b378d7a-1700x972.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384360,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAX2EB,1596802945,CoinDCX Becomes First India Exchange to Offer Users Crypto Staking,"The Indian crypto community now has the opportunity to earn passive income merely by holding cryptocurrencies – an activity known as staking.    Mumbai-based cryptocurrency exchange CoinDCX launched its new product on Friday, allowing its users to stake three cryptocurrencies: harmony (ONE), qtum (QTUM) and tron (TRX).  Users with a minimum balance of 100 ONE tokens, one QTUM token and five TRON tokens will be eligible for staking.  An alternative to proof-of-work, or mining, proof-of-stake is a system used by some blockchains enabling users to hold coins in a cryptocurrency wallet to support the operations of the network in return for newly minted coins.  In effect, staking is similar to buying government bonds in return for a fixed yield.  CoinDCX said it will pool the holdings of multiple customers as a way to increase their chances of receiving rewards.  “We want to make staking very simple for our users,” said Neeraj Khandelwal, co-founder of CoinDCX.  The exchange will aggregate staking rewards via partner exchanges such as Binance, and also stake natively on blockchains, according to the announcement.  CoinDCX is the first firm to launch a staking product within India, according to Khandelwal.  Mumbai-based WazirX exchange's founder and CEO, Nischal Shetty, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat his team is planning to launch a staking offering later this month for platforms like Tron and EOS.  Adoption driver?  Sumit Gupta, CEO of CoinDCX, told CoinDesk the lure of making additional earnings via staking would be a big boost for the Indian market and could drive cryptocurrency adoption in the country.  WazirX's Shetty agreed, saying, with interest on bank savings interest relatively low, Indian citizens are seeking other ways of earning passive income.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reduced the benchmark interest rate to a record low of 4% early this year.  The annual returns from staking ONE, QTUM and TRX at CoinDCX are 8%–10%, 6%–10%, and 5%–10% respectively, the exchange said.  Exchanges have witnessed a steady rise in trading volumes ever since the Supreme Court overruled the Reserve Bank of India’s ban on banking services for cryptocurrency firms in March.

42432460,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNZm5h,1596799487,First Mover: Kyber CEO Predicts 2020 Transactions at $3B as DeFi Token Soars,"The fast-growing realm of decentralized finance, known as DeFi, has produced some of the year’s richest returns for cryptocurrency investors, from Compound’s COMP tokens to Chainlink’s LINK.      So it may come as little surprise tthe Kyber Network’s KNC token has jumped eight-fold in price this year, giving it the largest market capitalization among decentralized exchanges tracked by the data firm Messari.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      First Mover interviewed Kyber CEO Loi Luu about the project, including its July 7 launch of the KyberDAO governance platform. Luu says some 30% of the circulating supply of KNC tokens are staked on the platform, which he argues is evidence that “holders want to get behind it.”      First Mover: How would you explain Kyber to the uninitiated?      The short version is to say it's a liquidity protocol for anybody, anywhere. The longer version of it is we’re building an on-chain liquidity endpoint in which contributors integrate to either contribute liquidity or utilize liquidity.  So why has the KNC token done so well this year?      People look at the growth of Kyber, and people look at the ecosystem that we’re building. I think so far we have one of the biggest ecosystems in this space. We have more than 100 different applications, wallets, that have integrated with Kyber. We have surpassed $1 billion of volume in 2020 and we are looking to cross $3 billion before the end of the year. Whether the token can do well or not, it really depends on how the protocol is performing.      Do you think there's any speculation in the KNC token related to future Kyber developments?      Honestly, I think there's going to be speculation for any token, so it’s not only for KNC. If you ask me, that’s true for every token.      What is the importance of liquidity in this ecosystem?      In finance, liquidity is the key. We are working closely with the DeFi community. For example, an asset management protocol from time to time, they need to rebalance their portfolio. So they need to do a lot of on-chain trading from one asset to another. And that's where Kyber can come in, because they can do everything on-chain.      What advantage does Kyber have by being on-chain?      I emphasize a lot on the on-chain aspect because everything Kyber does runs on the smart contract, on the blockchain. It’s important to run everything on-chain so it is smart contract talking to smart contract. Everything is trustless that way. There is no centralized custodian.      How do you feel about this year’s boom in DeFi?      Currently we are seeing a lot of experiments happening in the DeFi ecosystem, from liquidity mining, from bootstrapping adoption of a protocol and things like that. I think this is good that there are a lot of things happening. We’ve also started seeing a lot of new projects that have nothing to do with DeFi also branded as DeFi to get some hype. So I think there’s definitely some hype, but compared with the ICO boom in 2017, it’s nowhere close. We’re not seeing retail get into the DeFi hype. We’re not seeing people talking about DeFi in the mainstream.      DeFi is built on Ethereum, but there are constraints on that protocol, especially right now. How are you feeling about that today?      I think it really worries us. The gas prices, or fees to use Ethereum, are still very high. So we are actively looking at different layer-2 protocols to see which one that we should work with. For end users, they can’t pay $5 to $10 everytime they use a decentralized protocol. There must be a cheaper and more efficient way to use decentralized applications every day.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $11,775 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $11,924 | 24-Hr Low: $11,662      Trend: Bitcoin’s price action of the last 24 hours is telling a tale of indecision and hinting at price pullback.      The top cryptocurrency by market value jumped to highs above $11,900 during Thursday’s U.S. trading hours, extending the recovery from Sunday’s low of $10,659. However, further gains remained elusive and the cryptocurrency ended the day (UTC) on a flat note at $11,770.      Put simply, the day began with optimism but ended on a pessimistic note, with buyers failing to keep prices at highs above $11,900. The bulls had made another failed attempt to scale that level early on Friday.      This type of price action after a notable recovery rally and near multi-month highs is indicative of indecision among bulls (uptrend fatigue) and often precedes pullbacks.      The immediate support is located at $11,575 (Thursday’s low), which, if breached, would open the doors for $11,000. On the higher side, an hourly close above $11,900 would imply a continuation of the recovery rally and shift the focus to recent highs above $12,100.      At press time, the cryptocurrency is trading below $11,800, representing slight losses on the day.",POSITIVE,KNC,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | KNC | MARKET | TRADING,"Daniel Cawrey, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/08/07/first-mover-kyber-ceo-predicts-2020-transactions-at-3b-as-defi-token-soars,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/11e9858b09e0ffb9dfa51efe6fdf59cba3b1a41d-1450x944.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Announced Thursday, the partnership will see BCB add elements of Circle's crypto finance platform in an attempt to improve the efficiency of payments, clearing and custody for business customers.  The move means BCB's clients will gain access to USDC, the U.S. dollar-linked stablecoin launched by the CENTRE Consortium, which was founded by Circle and Coinbase in October 2018.  USDC can help EU-based companies ""mitigate negative risk"" exposure by providing secure and efficient payments solutions, BCB said in a statement.  According to Circle's co-founder and CEO, Jeremy Allaire, demand for dollar-pegged stablecoins is quickly growing and USDC would provide ""critical"" infrastructure for BCB's clients.  USDC moved close to 1.1 billion coins in circulation in July 2020, according to CoinMarketCap, with numbers having sharply risen since late March.  It still has a way to go to catch up on the most used stablecoin, tether (USDT), which now boasts a circulating supply close to 10 billion.  Circle recently teamed with Genesis Trading in a $25 million deal also aimed at boosting adoption of USDC. Like CoinDesk, Genesis is a fully owned Digital Currency Group subsidiary.

The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) updated its ""Greenlist"" this week to include Binance USD (BUSD).  This means permissioned financial institutions in the New York area can now custody and list BUSD without prior approval from the NYDFS but must still inform the regulator before adding it.  Binance Compliance Officer Samuel Lim told CoinDesk BUSD could be accepted ""on an immediate basis"" by licensed entities.  Binance said BUSD was NYDFS-approved at its launch in September 2019, but exchanges needed approval before listing it.  BUSD is a white-label stablecoin from the Paxos Trust Company, which the NYDFS approved to issue stablecoins in 2018.  Bitcoin, ether and litecoin are all on the NYDFS' Greenlist, as are stablecoins such as Gemini dollar and Paxos.  Notably absent is Binance coin (BNB), the exchange's native token. The spokesperson declined to comment on whether Binance was trying to get BNB greenlisted.  Binance U.S., the exchange's local trading platform, is still not available in New York.

As Reuter's reported on Wednesday, Commissioner Ryozo Himino said the regulator was not considering taking ""special steps"" to promote cryptocurrency trading.  Himino became the head of the FSA in July when he replaced the previous commissioner, Toshihide Endo.  Deregulating crypto, he said, would not necessarily advance technical innovation but could increase ""speculative"" trading.  Instead, Japan should focus on the viability of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) that the country's central bank, the Bank of Japan, is currently exploring.  In undertaking a CBDC, Japan would need to think ""really hard"" about whether to issue a digital currency based on the ""merits and demerits"" in doing so, he said.
