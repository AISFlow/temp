42381646,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nd2p,1551132398,Bitcoin Shorts Dropped to 11-Month Lows During Sunday's Sell-Off,"The number of short bets placed against the price of bitcoin on at least one notable exchange declined to their lowest total in 11 months on Sunday.  Data from Bitfinex shows that bitcoin’s 8 percent drop in price on Sunday was accompanied by a 12 percent drop in the notional value of open short positions, with the total amount of such trades dropping from a daily high of 19,604 to 17,085 BTC, the lowest amount allocated on the platform since March 12 of last year.  The development comes just a week after the total value tied up in all short trades on the exchange reached a six-month low, one of a number of signs that would suggest investors are losing confidence in the idea that bitcoin's price will further decrease.  Still, the market has appeared inconclusive in its reading of what would appear to be positive indicators.  Up until 3:00 UTC on Sunday, bitcoin was boasting a near 15 percent week-over-week price increase, but it ended just 3 percent higher as a result of Sunday’s sell-off, according to pricing data from CoinDesk.  When such a harsh rejection from a key technical resistance occurs, strengthened bearish sentiment can usually be quantified by an increase in the total amount of funds allocated to BTC/USD short positions, or bets that profit from future declines in price, yet the developments on Sunday contradicted this notion.  BTC/USD Shorts on Bitfinex  At the same time, the bitcoin-denominated value of all BTC/USD long positions on Bitfinex Sunday fell to just 26,433, which was less than 1 percent lower than it started.  As a result, that lack of short interest following the considerable drop in bitcoin's price is more likely a sign of investors taking profit after the bullish start to the week rather than fresh selling hitting the market.  What's more, the ratio of the total BTC/USD long to short positions on Bitfinex currently reads 1.43 to 1, making it clear the drop has not completely scared off those favoring a near-term bullish outlook.

The first step in the partnership, according to a Monday announcement, is to integrate Fusion's blockchain platform and digitize AXP’s current database of 10.5 million automobiles, so they can be properly tracked and audited.  The auto industry has long struggled with a lack of transparency and widespread information inaccuracies from titles all the way through financing, said Max Kane CEO and co-founder of AXP, adding,  “There's a million vehicles on the road that have 'washed' titles, which means there is fraud there. The insurance industry is hit with billions in fraud because of missing information, drivers providing the wrong information and inaccurate reporting.”  The AXP network encompasses some 25,000 independent car dealers across the U.S. and this extends to relationships with counterparties in finance and loan origination, Kane said.  John Liu, chief product officer at the Singapore-based Fusion Foundation, said the pilot, which is now underway, could be extended to state-based government agencies and the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). The system, which will go live by the first half of this year is expected to handle $60m–$100m of car financing loans, he said.  Fusion is known for having raised over $40 million in an oversubscribed token sale a year ago (many investors were turned away and the sale had to be stopped after 24 hours). The firm has ambitious goals when it comes to tokenizing assets, having previously partnered with firms involved in asset management and car financing – opening up a potential $12.3 billion in assets, Reuters reported.  Fusion's founder, DJ Qian, said the blockchain his company has built was inspired by ethereum and will have both public and permissioned components. “We didn’t want to reinvent the wheel,” he said.  Liu added that “spinning up a node will be as easy as in something like bitcoin or ethereum,” but said only a select group of validators will be running such nodes to begin with.  He continued:  “We don’t need the government or dealers to worry about running a node yet. We want them to use an application that they are familiar with. The number of nodes will be as much as we need to support a secure blockchain.”  Used cars image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TOKEN SALE,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/02/25/2-crypto-startups-want-to-put-10-million-used-cars-on-a-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/81f7b0e3da956ae2baaec17cf92ffa6fa6cb5ebd-630x440.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Crypto exchange Coinbase is launching support for XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.  The exchange announced Monday it would be listing XRP on its professional trading platform, Coinbase Pro, in ""transfer-only"" mode, meaning customers can only deposit tokens to begin with. After a minimum of 12 hours, the company plans to activate other trading services, though this timeline is variable.  Initially, Coinbase Pro customers in the U.S. (excluding New York state), the UK, some EU nations, Canada, Singapore and Australia will be able to access XRP, with support for other jurisdictions possibly being added in the future.  While no firm timeline for launching support on Coinbase's retail platforms (coinbase.com, as well as its Android and iOS apps) was given, the exchange typically launches cryptocurrencies for its non-professional users within a few weeks of launching support on Coinbase Pro.  ""The [XRP] ledger is powered by a network of peer-to-peer servers. All accounts on this network can send or receive XRP to/from each other, while XRP can be used to send underlying fiat currencies between two parties,"" a Coinbase blog post said, adding:    ""In this way, XRP can function as a bridge currency in transactions involving different currencies such as US dollars, Japanese yen, Euros, Francs, and others in use on the XRP network.""

Speaking to CNBC's Becky Quick, the chairman and CEO of the multinational conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway reiterated his long-held views on bitcoin, calling the way some people perceive the cryptocurrency ""a delusion.""  ""It's ingenious and blockchain is important but bitcoin has no unique value at all,"" Buffett said. ""It doesn't produce anything, you can stare at it all day and no little bitcoins come out or anything like that.""  Acknowledging that bitcoin and blockchain were explained to him by others, Buffett added:    ""People get their hopes up that something like that is going to change their lives, and it's a very ingenious thing to figure out how to have a limited supply and make it harder and more expensive to create them as you go along and all that sort of thing but it doesn't, the function ... blockchain does not depend on [bitcoin].""            He did not elaborate on why he sees blockchain as being important.  Buffett did, however, note that JPMorgan Chase is launching its own dollar-pegged cryptocurrency, the JPM Coin. It is unclear how the so-called Sage of Omaha feels about this particular use case.  Like Buffett, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has long been a bitcoin detractor, famously calling it a ""fraud"" in 2017 (though he later said he regretted the comment, despite continued reservations).  'Rat poison squared'  Buffett's views on bitcoin are well-known: as far back as 2014, he was warning investors to avoid the cryptocurrency.  Last May, he referred to bitcoin as ""rat poison squared,"" noting that it was a ""nonproductive asset"" during the annual Berkshire shareholder meeting.  Bitcoin's price is dependent on individuals wanting to pay more for each coin than was previously paid, he said.  Similarly, he predicted that bitcoin would come to ""a bad ending"" in January 2018, and emphasized that Berkshire would not hold a position in bitcoin futures.

42381647,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nd1Z,1551110453,NFTs Are Here. But Where Are They Headed?,"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.    ___________    There was something both fresh and familiar about the NFT.NYC conference that non-fungible token developer PeopleBrowsr put on at the PlayStation Theater in Times Square last week.  It felt like some of the early bitcoin conferences: A little scrappy and rough around the edges, some wild ideas that ranged from practical to pie-in-the-sky, but in all exuding a great deal of enthusiasm for a novel blockchain technology that could spawn a variety of new business and philanthropic models.  It remains to be seen whether NFTs can get beyond the gimmick status they occupied in popular imagination since Dapper Labs launched CryptoKitties, the popular game that creates unique, collectible, breedable digital cats. There are questions about scalability and interoperability associated with ERC-721, the dominant, Ethereum-based NFT standard, and on whether the world will embrace outside-the-box ideas for redefining value, property and commerce.  As with bitcoin’s development, success or failure will depend upon the emergence of an impassioned community and ecosystem around the technology, and the vibe at NFT.NYC suggested this is happening.  What’s both interesting and challenging, though, is that the very notion of community in the NFT world is quite different from the one observed in fungible tokens such as bitcoin. Unlike a bitcoin, which is intended to be fully substitutable for any other bitcoin, a non-fungible token is a unique piece of digital property.  Thus, the community that assigns value to that asset can often be quite narrow.  Speaking with me on stage, Arnold Waldstein, who raised $140,000 for ocean conservation via the Honu project – a collectible CryptoKitty that was part turtle, part cat – noted that Honu became a compelling storytelling device with which to galvanize action among a specific community of people passionate about ocean health.  But at the same time, the structure and community makeup made it difficult to achieve fundraising goals under the initial proposal. The team eventually had to abandon an auction model and went for a one-off sale.  It’s challenges like that which have people questioning what kind of business model could function for NFTs. Thankfully, some compelling ideas for new models that address them bubbled forth at the event.  Cashing on future upside  One key idea is that by attaching a smart contract that enshrines rights for the primary issuer of a token to future income from secondary market sales, creators of digital assets can be encouraged to relinquish control of them.  Venture capitalist David Pakman argued that the idea could lead NFT-embracing gaming companies to dramatically change their approach to how they make money. Such companies could deliberately create a limited supply of a particular digital artifact and ensure that they extract upside from future sales.  This way, rather than locking gamers into a walled garden of value capture, they can let their assets escape into the wider world, where they can generate greater value for the brand.  There was much talk of artists doing the same with otherwise unique, one-off works of art. As of now, an artist might sell a painting to a buyer for $10,000 but gain no benefit when a collector or a gallery subsequently buys it from that first buyer for, say, $1 million. If the work were indelibly associated with a unique NFT and a smart contract to manage future transaction rights, there could be a way for the original artist to participate in that future appreciation.  The approach could also enable payments for derivative works by creatives working with others’ original music or other artistic content. Or it could help charitable efforts like the Honu project, because the resale of the crypto-turtle-kitty to future buyers could continue to kick back funds to philanthropic cause it represents.  It’s these kinds of ideas that make the NFT conversation so engaging, enabling a break with pre-existing mental models so that innovators can conceive of creative new approaches to problems.  For now, much of it is highly intangible, though it was good to see NFT.NYC exhibitors such as Vault.io, which demonstrated the potential for redeemable NFTs to transform gift tokens, branding and commercial exchange by showing visitors how to redeem a token in their wallet for a cup of coffee delivered by a Raspberry Pi-enabled coffee machine.  The tension between community and economy  Still, the question remains whether the narrow community of interests attached to specific NFTs can generate enough liquidity to make them viable.  This will depend in part on the success of different blockchain community’s scaling initiatives and on interoperability solutions such as the Cosmos and Polkadot networks, which could enable NFTs to move across blockchains. If the entire world is to be “tokenized” with these unique digital markers, as some suggest will be the case, we have to get far beyond the clunky on-chain transaction-processing capabilities of Ethereum and its competitors.  It’s a vision worth fighting for because communities are the breeding grounds for all notions of value. If you can tap into them, you can drive adoption. To achieve that, developers must consider that each community is unique: the things they value, the contracts their members enter into, and their preference for how to govern themselves aren’t necessarily served by anchoring themselves into monolithic blockchains with rigid programming logic.  It’s why, in addition to NFTs, other projects are working on community-based digital asset issuance models that don’t depend on an underlying chain or virtual machine such as Ethereum to process all transactions.  These include Intercoin, perhaps best known for now by a prominent hand-painted mural that greets motorists on the Gowanus Expressway heading into Manhattan from Brooklyn, and the colorfully named Economic Space Agency that was set up in Oakland, California by a group of radical economists, technologists and other social scientists.  The common idea in these concepts is that the smart contract-features, the terms attached the token, and the consensus model can be designed uniquely according to each community’s preferences. Whether they can be secure from attack and sufficiently liquid is the question.  In all of this, there is tension between the narrow, subjectivities of a distinct community’s expressions of value and the requirement to interface that otherwise closed subset of interests with a more universally accepted expression of value in the wider economy – in other words with fungible, negotiable instruments such as bitcoin or dollars.  It’s in confronting those tensions and figuring out the best business models to overcome them that NFTs and their ilk have the best chance of enabling practical, real implementations that can have a marked impact on the world. The more that those who are working on them come together and explore the prospects, the greater the chance of success.

42381634,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ncnj,1551106845,Accenture's New Blockchain App Lets Users Tip 'Sustainable' Producers,"Accenture has announced a prototype blockchain-based supply chain app designed to reward business practices that conserve natural resources.  Announced today, the consulting firm said it's working with Mastercard, blockchain startup Everledger and humanitarian aid organization Mercy Corps to encourage the introduction of the so-called ""circular supply chain.""  A circular supply chain is a way to organize production so that the materials get recycled as much as possible, with discarded goods captured and components and materials re-used.  Accenture envisions its app will allow consumers to easily track the provenance of the goods they are buying and see if a producer has a certification for sustainable practices. Consumers could also use the app to send tips as a reward for responsible producers.  This reward can be sent in a form of a blockchain-based token or a fiat transfer powered by Mastercard payment rails, Accenture’s global blockchain lead David Treat told CoinDesk.  He added that Accenture is aiming to enroll small farms across the world and allow them to register their certificates of ecologically conscious practices on a blockchain as a part of their digital identity, allowing consumers to see who produced the goods they are buying and how that business is managed.  The company is also working with farmers’ associations in Africa and South America that might want to participate in the system, Treat said. The associations will be responsible for maintaining cloud-based nodes on behalf of their farmers.  Mercy Corps plans to contribute its experience working with farmers’ communities across the globe to the project, Ric Shreves, a senior advisor to the Technology for Development team at the NGO, told CoinDesk.  Shreves said:  “In this stage of the project, we are exploring possible agricultural programs in our current program portfolio to pilot Circular Supply Chain. We think it will be best suited for boutique consumer goods, for example single origin coffee, as opposed to bulk goods.”  Accenture has built a prototype on Hyperledger Fabric, Treat said, and is looking to onboard more partners to participate. Mastercard can contribute its expertise in blockchain and payment systems, as well as access to communities it’s already working with. However, the role of the payments giant in the new joint project is not yet finalized, he said.  Tara Nathan, executive vice president for humanitarian issues and development at Mastercard, said in Accenture’s announcement: “Through our work with smallholder farmers in Kenya, India, Mexico and elsewhere, we’ve deployed digital solutions helping to drive commercially sustainable social impact – and we understand that collaboration is essential for this journey,”  Coffee processing image via Shutterstock.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MINING | REGULATION,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/02/25/accentures-new-blockchain-app-lets-users-tip-sustainable-producers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/987f060abc9cde7beff6dc74db0a167afc8a7d76-1483x905.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42381631,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ncjx,1551103253,Security Token Startup Templum Shifts to Private Blockchains,"Security token specialist Templum is shifting from public to private blockchains.  Announced Monday, enterprise software vendor Symbiont is building a private blockchain and smart contracts system that Templum will use for future security token offerings (STOs) by its clients. Previously, the regulated broker-dealer left the choice of blockchain protocol up to the issuers, but this posed problems, Templum CEO Christopher Pallotta told CoinDesk.  Many were choosing ERC-20 tokens that run on top of ethereum, said Pallotta, but that network's well-known scaling challenges meant trading could be hampered during periods of high transaction volumes, such as the peak of the CryptoKitties craze.  “A blockchain like public ethereum may slow down or stop capacity when you are in the middle of a million dollar or ten million dollar transaction,” said Vincent Molinari, co-founder of Templum. And regulatory compliance is hard because it’s not possible to know who your counterparties are on public chains, he added.  Pallotta said there were also legal concerns about whether ethereum miners would have to be registered as broker-dealers. All told, he said:  “We believe for securities issuance, you need a private, controlled blockchain ... [you] need control of the full lifecycle.""  Still, Molinari tipped his hat to the “wonderful cryptographers” and innovation that has been happening on public chains. “We are very thankful in many ways for the visibility and that technical prowess. We have always embraced the evolution of capital formation that ties directly to secondary liquidity.”  Templum made headlines last year by offering investors “Aspen coins” representing shares in the St. Regis Aspen Resort. The company also tied up a deal with patent transaction platform IPwe to leverage liquidity from intellectual property. The Aspen tokens currently run on Securitize's private DS protocol.  Big-name ties  One thing that made Symbiont an appealing choice for Templum was its ties to Citigroup and Nasdaq, both of which participated in the enterprise blockchain company's recent $20 million funding round, Pallotta said.  The companies framed their partnership as a way to make the market for private securities – which are not registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but legal since they are offered only to sophisticated or wealthy investors – more efficient and transparent.  Molinari said the system whereby unregistered securities are transacted as it exists today is opaque and this results in numerous frictions and added costs.  Ben Spiegelman, strategy leader at Symbiont, said the fact that initial coin offerings (ICOs) on public chains raised over $20 billion in the 2017–2018 bubble only confirms what people who have been around the $3 trillion private securities market have known for some time, namely:  “Investors want greater access to companies. Entrepreneurs want a larger pool of investors. They want more streamlined capital raising processes and they want enhanced liquidity – all the things that were sort of promised with ICOs.”  Nikhilesh De contributed reporting to this article  Mark Smith, Symbiont CEO image via CoinDesk Consensus archives",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TOKEN SALE,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/02/25/security-token-startup-templum-shifts-to-private-blockchains,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3921c368978afe10271375ec51f02911e7067c06-1500x1144.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42381621,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nY4b,1551099621,Australian Regulator Trials Blockchain to Automate Transaction Reporting,"An Australian financial regulator is trialing blockchain technology to automate reporting of cross-border transactions by institutions.  ZDNet reported Sunday that the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) has partnered with the Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne to build a prototype for the trial.  The two partners will specifically examine how blockchain and smart contracts, as well as other technologies, can help entities such as banks to automate reporting of international funds transfer instructions (IFTIs) to the regulator.  Australia’s Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act mandates that institutions or specific categories of individuals involved in a cross-border transfer of funds – including payer, sender and beneficiary institution – must report details of the transaction within 10 days.  The trial effort started in December and is likely to run for a year, according to the report.  Last month, Swinburne University collaborated with tech firm Capgemini to establish a new global Blockchain Centre of Excellence (CoE) in Melbourne. The blockchain trial, therefore, will likely involve Capgemini’s network from development to production, ZDNet suggests.  Back in March 2017, AUSTRAC also opened an innovation center dedicated in part to blockchain research.  Last spring, the agency brought in new rules for cryptocurrency exchanges aimed to counter money laundering and terrorism financing (AML/CTF), including mandated registration with AUSTRAC.

42381613,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nXuX,1551094238,US Government Returns Bitcoins Retrieved Following 2016 Bitfinex Hack,"Bitfinex has announced that some of the bitcoins stolen in a major 2016 hack have been returned after they were retrieved by the U.S. government.  In a blog post published Monday, the exchange said that 27.66270285 BTC – worth just over $104,000 at time of writing – have been received from the U.S. government, and come as the result of U.S. law enforcement efforts.  Bitfinex said that, since the hack, it has been collaborating with international law enforcement agencies ""to provide intelligence and assist with investigations,"" adding:  ""Bitfinex was alerted in November 2018 that the U.S. government had obtained bitcoins believed to be proceeds from the 2016 hack.""  The August 2016 hack, in which a total of 119,756 BTC were stolen, shocked the crypto market with the largest loss of bitcoins by an exchange since Japan’s Mt. Gox huge breach in early 2014.  The returned funds represent about 0.023 percent of the total taken in the attack.  As pledged in its recovery strategy formulated after the 2016 breach, the returned funds are being converted to U.S. dollars and will be paid to current holders of its RRT (Recovery Right Token) token.  To compensate for the hack losses in 2016, the exchange generalized the losses across all accounts and credited BFX tokens to customers at a ratio of 1 BFX to every dollar stolen.  ""Within eight months of the security breach, all BFX token holders had their tokens redeemed at 100 cents on the dollar or exchanged their tokens for, directly or indirectly, shares of the capital stock of iFinex Inc. All BFX tokens were destroyed within this process,"" Bitfinex said in Monday's post.  Bitfinex created the tradable RRT token for BFX holders allowing them to convert BFX tokens into shares of iFinex, it added.  After any outstanding or unconverted BFX token holders have been reimbursed, as per the recovery plan, recovered funds were set to be distributed to RRT holders, up to 1 dollar per RRT.  ""As all BFX tokens have been redeemed and destroyed, the full amount of recovered bitcoins today is being distributed pro rata to the RRT holders,"" Btfinex stated.  Thanking the U.S. federal law enforcement agencies for their efforts in investigating the attack and returning the stolen funds, Giancarlo Devasini, chief financial officer at Bitfinex, said:  “Over two years following the hack of the Bitfinex platform, today we see the results of a clear and robust response strategy and the efforts of the U.S. government. It gives us great pleasure to be able to reimburse our traders that were loyal to us and believed in us at a very difficult time.""  The exchange, he continued, will continue to assist law enforcement with their inquiries. With much of the stolen bitcoin still missing, Devasini called for the hackers, or anyone with information about the breach, to make contact ""to finally resolve the situation in a mutually beneficial manner.”  Correction: This article previously incorrectly stated the percentage of the total bitcoins that have been returned. This has now been corrected.

42381627,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nYAt,1551092414,Bitcoin's Bull Trend At Risk After High-Volume Price Dump,"View  Bitcoin dropped 9.3 percent yesterday on the back of high volumes, invalidating the triangle breakout witnessed last Monday.  A UTC close below $3,714 today would validate Sunday's bearish outside reversal candle and open the doors to levels below $3,400.  The longer duration charts are signaling bearish exhaustion, however, and any drop to $3,400 or below could be short-lived.  A move above $4,190 (previous day's low) is needed to revive the bullish outlook.  Bitcoin (BTC) nosedived overnight, clouding the interim bullish outlook, and a deeper drop could unfold if key support near $3,700 is breached.  The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization rose to highs near $4,200 in the Asian trading hours yesterday, as expected, only to fall back to levels below $3,800 by UTC close. That 9.31 percent slide is the biggest single-day drop since Jan. 11.  Notably, trading volumes across all cryptocurrency exchanges totaled $10.79 billion on Sunday – the highest since April 25, 2018, according to CoinMarketCap.  The high-volume sell-off erased gains seen over the previous five days, thereby weakening the bullish case put forward by last Monday’s break above $3,800.  That said, a bullish-to-bearish trend change would be confirmed only if the sell-off seen yesterday is extended to levels below $3,700. Further, the losses following a potential bearish reversal could be short-lived, as signs of seller exhaustion have emerged on longer duration charts.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,780 on Bitstamp, representing a 7.78 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  Daily chart        As seen above, BTC created a widely-followed candlestick pattern called “bearish outside-day” yesterday – invalidating the triangle breakout seen on Feb. 18.  A bearish reversal would be confirmed if prices close today (UTC) below $3,714 (Sunday’s low). That could yield a drop toward the recent lows below $3,400.  Hourly chart  The probability of BTC closing today below $3,714 would rise if the pennant pattern seen on the 4-hour chart is breached to the downside.  A break below the lower edge of the pennant, currently at $3,740, would confirm a breakdown and could be followed by a sell-off to $3,360 (target as per the measured move method).  BTC, however, may rise back to $4,000 if the pennant is breached to the higher side.  Weekly chart  The inverted hammer seen in the above chart indicates that the buyers managed to eke out gains last week despite the sell on the rise mentality.  Put simply, the bulls are beginning to test bear's strength, which is a sign the market is bottoming out.  As a result, sellers need to be cautious even if prices break below $3,700 today, as the ensuing losses could be short-lived.

42381625,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nY77,1551088838,A Group of 30 Global Central Securities Depositories Is Exploring Crypto Custody,"A group of central securities depositories (CSDs) in Europe and Asia is taking a serious look at how they might collaborate on infrastructure to custody digital assets.  Still very much in the exploratory phase, the CSDs are planning to present the findings of their working groups at the annual SIBOS conference in London in October. But these organizations, which have been guarding stock certificates for decades, clearly see an opportunity to apply their knowledge and skills to the crypto space, where losing your private keys means losing your coins forever.  Indeed, far from the ""blockchain not bitcoin"" mentality that such enterprises exemplified a few years ago, the group’s focus is looking at how to protect these keys for crypto investors, and how the tokenization of everything stands to change ... well, everything.  Artem Duvanov, head of innovation at the National Settlement Depository (NSD) of the Moscow Exchange Group, told CoinDesk:  “A new world of tokenized assets and blockchain is coming. It will probably disrupt our role as CSDs. The whole group decided we will be focusing on tokenized assets, not just blockchain but on real digital assets.”  Since coming together under the auspices of the International Securities Services Association (ISSA) last year, the CSDs' crypto-asset initiative has doubled in size to over 30 participants. Key members in the next stage are NSD, Belgium-based Euroclear, Swiss stock exchange SIX, and the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange (ADX). Duvanov said the aim right now is to create “a common vision” as opposed to a deadlined platform build.  Alexander Chekanov, the NSD's chief architect, who is heading the working group on safekeeping of crypto assets, said the research being carried out regarding tokenized securities “certainly applies to cryptocurrencies"" as well.  Chekanov pointed out that the NSD’s own D3 solution is geared specifically towards safekeeping and providing legal services for cryptocurrencies, which it is now piloting with two other CSDs: KDD of Slovenia and ADX.  “Obviously the ideas that we have in ISSA are heavily correlated with what we are doing in D3,” said Chekanov.  Banks on board?  Walter Verbeke, global head of business model and innovation for the Euroclear Group, said the next phase of the research will also involve some large custodian banks.  “So BNY Mellon would be there, HSBC, Standard Chartered, those types of banks. And of course a number of other European banks as well – again the usual suspects, BNP Paribas, Deutsche [Bank] and so on,” said Verbeke.  State Street, Credit Suisse and Standard Bank are also going to be participating, said Chekanov.  None of the banks answered requests for comment by press time.  The initial thought paper that Verbeke co-authored last year looked broadly at the potential roles financial market infrastructure (FMI) providers could play in crypto.  Among other ideas, the paper suggested that FMIs working in collaboration with custodian banks and technology providers could provide an independent safekeeping service for private keys.  “They would need to decide collectively on the most secure method of storing private keys in terms of physical protection. They might also wish to create an audited reserve to back any liability they incur to compensate investors for losses,” it said.  Oceans apart  The European and Asian CSDs' newfound interest in tokenization also stands in sharp contrast to the blockchain work being done by their U.S. counterpart, the DTCC, and by the Australian Securities Exchange, which are mainly about targeting cost savings related to a distributed ledger technology settlement layer.  “I would say the ASX don't actually agree with an assumption we all made that tokenization will play a big role in the future,” said Duvanov.  Indeed, the DTCC was invited to contribute to the thought paper and working groups, said Verbeke, but did not play a big part. (DTCC and ASX officials were not available for comment by press time.)  However, NSD’s Chekanov said that in the broader scheme of things, the ISSA working groups and the DTCC and ASX projects are heading toward the same end-goal, just from different entry points, explaining:  ""We are in the same place except we would onboard the crypto market first and then if that proved more efficient we would onboard traditional [assets] onto that market – and they would go the other way around.”  It's also important to note that unlike their U.S. or Aussie brethren, the European CSDs – or at least the ones in the European Union – may have a stronger incentive to pursue custody business for security tokens since they'd enjoy a captive audience.  That's because EU regulations state that for any financial instrument to be transferable and tradable, it must be registered at a CSD.  Chekanov acknowledged business processes would differ for different types of assets, although they will have much in common. The aim, he said, is to combine cold storage solutions with reliable business processes to ensure crypto securities cannot be lost and that the regulators will be happy no matter what happens to the status of these securities in the future.  “Bitcoin was originally called ‘digital gold’ and that's a very good analogy,” said Chekanov. “What we do in the real world with gold is stash it somewhere in very reliable storage and trade certificates and the gold itself is not really moved. I believe it will be the same with cryptocurrencies.”  The fact that State Street, Credit Suisse and Standard Bank are also going to be participating in the IAAS working group has been added to this story.

42381619,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nY25,1551086195,South Korean Crypto Exchange Declares Bankruptcy Citing Embezzlement,"South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Coinbin has declared bankruptcy after suffering millions of dollars in losses, in part due to claimed embezzlement.  Coinbin published a notice on its website on Wednesday, stating that “increased debt” and “government regulation” led to the firm having to halt its business operations. Specifically, it said regulators' suspension of its ability to issue virtual accounts to users was part of the cause, as well as increased operating expenses and liabilities from its collapsed subsidiary exchange Youbit.  A report from Business Korea on Friday indicated that Coinbin suffered estimated losses of 29.3 billion won (or $26 million).  According to the notice, Coinbin halted all crypto and cash withdrawals at 3:00 pm on Wednesday, and asked users to not deposit any more funds in their accounts. “The settlement of cash and [cryptocurrencies] will be carried out by all bankruptcy procedures,” it added.  The exchange further cited “corporate executive moral hazard” as one of the reasons for its bankruptcy. It explained that an executive from Youbit had ""lost"" paper wallets containing “hundreds” of cryptocurrency private keys last November. The notice said the company is making efforts to recover the funds and that it will make “civil and criminal complaints” against the executive.  Coinbin acquired crypto exchange Youbit in 2017, according to Business Korea. Coinbin CEO Park Chan-kyu told the news source that Youbit’s former CEO had “committed dereliction of duty and embezzled company funds.”  Back in December, Youbit announced it was declaring bankruptcy following a second hack of its platform. The exchange said at the time that it had lost around 17 percent of its total assets in the breach. Compounding its problems, its insurer refused to pay out to cover its losses.  Youbit, previously known as Yapizon, suffered its first hack last April – one South Korean officials believed was conducted with the support of neighboring North Korea.  Last month, South Korea's Ministry of Science and ICT, the Korea Internet & Security Agency and the Ministry of Economy and Finance reported that they had inspected 21 crypto exchanges and only a third passed a security audit.

Ohanian further added that the fact JPMorgan is now building a crypto product – even though CEO Jamie Dimon previously called bitcoin a ""fraud"" – indicates ""there is real innovation that is happening now that all the wild speculation is gone.""  That said, he acknowledged it's going to take some time before the crypto industry can see the shift, and one needs to take a longer-term view when investing in the space.  ""I think that's just generally good advice for any kind of investing, but especially something so nascent as crypto,"" he said.  This is not the first time Ohanian has offered a positive take on cryptocurrency. In March last year, he said bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are poised to “fuel a potential new internet.”  Ohanian has also put his money where his mouth is. In the Friday's interview, he said that Reddit was a seed investor in crypto exchange Coinbase back in 2011. Most recently, Ohanian also participated in a $28.5 million funding round of a blockchain-based sharing economy startup Origin Protocol.  The site's chief technology officer said last May the platform was also planning to reinstate cryptocurrency as a payment option for its gold members. The option had been stopped due to high fees on the bitcoin network and an integration issue.

42381626,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nY8N,1551064909,"Long-Term Bitcoin Price Indicator Turns Bearish, Suggesting Bottom May Be In","A lagging indicator has turned bearish for the first time in four years, suggesting bitcoin's price may have bottomed out and that a new bull run could begin this year.  As of press time, bitcoin's 50-week moving average has dropped below the 100-week MA, confirming a bearish crossover – the first since April 2015. Long-term bearish crossovers, however, tend to occur at the end of a big bear move, with prices rallying soon after, as MAs are based on past data.  For instance, the 50-week MA responds to price action seen over the last 12 months, and the 100-week MA tracks much older data. Therefore, the bearish cross of the two is the product of a prolonged bear market – BTC dropped from $20,000 to $3,122 in the 12 months ending December 2018.  Put simply, it takes a great effort on the part of the bears to push the 50-week MA below the 100-week MA. As a result, the bear market is usually exhausted by the time the crossover is confirmed, which seems to be the case with BTC.  The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization is currently trading at $3,749, up more than 19 percent from the lows near $3,100 seen 11 weeks ago. Further, bitcoin’s historical data shows the previous bear market ended with the 50-week MA falling below the 100-week MA in April 2015.  Weekly chart  As seen above, the 50-week MA fell below the 100-week MA in April 2015 – three months after the bear market stalled at lows near $150.  The cryptocurrency spent the following five months consolidating in a range of $200-$300 before breaking higher into a fresh bull market in October 2015. Interestingly, all this happened a year before bitcoin underwent its second mining reward halving in July 2016.  With the third reward halving due in less than 12 months, history looks to be repeating itself.  The latest bearish crossover has happened nearly three months after the sell-off from December 2017 highs ran out of steam near $3,100.  The relative strength index (RSI) has breached the falling trendline, warning the bear cross could trap sellers on the wrong side of the market. Further, the cryptocurrency is now looking north, having witnessed a high-volume bullish breakout last week.  So, there is a strong possibility that BTC will begin a new bull run later this year by violating the bearish lower highs pattern, as represented by the trendline sloping downwards from December 2017 highs.
