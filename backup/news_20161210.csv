42379059,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mrE5,1481387435,Time is Money as Alternative Banking Moves to the Blockchain,"A new project is seeking to adapt the adage 'time is money' for the blockchain age.  Loosely based on a system called time banking, invented in the early 19th century, Sydney, Australia-based Chronobank is working on issuing blockchain tokens (similar to bitcoins on the bitcoin blockchain) that would allow labor hours to be used as a currency.  As such, the company is perhaps the latest example that showcases how fringe economic systems are inspiring new ones based on blockchain. But Chronobank is notably using the global power of these networks to attempt to expand the historical abilities of the system on which it's based.  For example, in time banking today, a merchant trades one hour's worth of work for the consumer's one person-hour, which the merchant can then use to pay for another merchant's goods or services later.  But while this most often happens at a local level, labor hour tokens at Chronobank will be linked to average wages in each country.  These coins will also be tradable peer to peer and on a decentralized marketplace called LaborX, and tied to a reputation system for employees and employers, allowing employers to choose the best workers for the job and workers to assess hiring companies worldwide.  In that, the online platform will help connect a more globalized workforce.  Community effect  That's not to say that time banking processes haven't been digitized to a certain extent.  But online portals for time banking are generally used to more easily manage earned and spent time, not as much for connecting time bankers in disparate areas. For instance, Paul Glover, who is currently an adviser to Chronobank, developed the paper note, Ithaca Hour, in 1991 to stimulate economic growth in his upstate New York community.  Since then, more than $110,000 worth of Ithaca Hours have been issued in an area where 500 merchants accept the currency and thousands of residents use it. The project also began offering no-interest loans with the local currency up to $30,000.  ""This paper money is a tangible, powerful symbol of community solidarity, like a business’ logo or a nation’s flag,"" Glover told CoinDesk.  The experiment brought together the community through a physical marketplace where people interacted and became more than just consumers to each other, he said, noting its effect on building a stronger local community.  A global link  While Glover admits that he doesn't fully comprehend the blockchain, he hopes Chronobank has the capacity to stimulate the growth of local communities albeit on a global scale.  ""I endorse all types of experimentation in monetary objects,"" he said, explaining that he’d like to see a hybrid hour-denominated currency, a unit both in paper and digital form.  Glover’s position as an adviser will likely help steer the project in the right direction. Because the Ithaca Hour initiative expanded outside a few friends, the project now has a catalogue of goods and their prices as determined by the community. For instance, a massage is worth four hours.  This goes above and beyond the traditional time banking model where one hour equals one time credit.  ""Anything bigger than a small community would not work in such away, as the people are less inclined to discount their hours and time for total strangers. What we are trying to do, is to think of a community as our whole planet, not just small town,"" said Sergei Sergienko, CEO of Chronobank.  For that, he believes a distributed, blockchain-based system is needed.  ""The current system is too inefficient and too expensive,"" Sergienko said. ""And current systems leave too much room for abusing the workers.""  In this case, Chronobank is trying to solve this using smart contracts that immediately settle as the work is delivered.  Token fundraiser  Of course, time will now tell if the idea will work.  In mid-December, through a smart contract-enabled distributed autonomous organization (DAO) on the ethereum blockchain, Chronobank will release 'Time' (a different token than labor hours) as part of a token sale that will seek to raise money for the platform.  While many in the industry have become wary of initial coin offerings (ICOs), Sergienko said, they are sometimes the only way to raise funds.  This is especially the case, he said, for open-source projects like Chronobank, since venture capitalists aren't as interested in companies that give proprietary code away for free.  The project, though, does already have some momentum.  Sergienko is also the cofounder of Edway Group P/L which runs Edway Labor Hire, an Australian training organization for the construction, hospitality and healthcare industries.  And he’ll be using his position there to leverage Edway's database of employees to test the platform.

42379056,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mrCp,1481380500,Ether Prices Fall to Lowest Since February as Sentiment Sours,"Markets Weekly is a weekly column analyzing price movements in the global blockchain token markets. This edition looks at the week from 3rd through 9th December.  The price of ether extended recent losses this week, falling to its lowest in more than nine months.  Over the seven-day period, the blockchain token declined to as little as $5.98 on 6th December, its lowest price since late February. This figure, which beat the previous nine-month low set the previous day, represented a 22.9% decline from the cryptocurrency’s opening price of $7.76 on 3rd December.  The continued struggles faced by the digital currency are now translating into frustration for traders and market influencers.  ""The novelty is wearing off,"" said Tim Enneking, chairman of cryptocurrency hedge fund EAM.  Enneking argued that ether, despite its original hype, is simply behaving as most blockchain tokens historically have, riding high on a ""flavor of the month effect"" before tapering off.  Enneking told CoinDesk:  ""The major ones are greeted with acclaim, skyrocket and then plunge to earth. Look at Zcash and, further back, Litecoin. All the same thing.""  Fading star  That the price of the protocol's token is sputtering is perhaps not surprising. As a technology, ethereum has run into numerous challenges of late, undergoing several hard forks and one network split in 2016.  Most recently, ethereum underwent a hard fork (a technical change during which all of its users have to opt in to a new version of the blockchain) in an attempt to make it easier for developers to remove the after-effects of an attack.  Then, only a few days later, the platform suffered a mini fork when two of its clients, Geth and Parity, failed to implement the latest hard fork the same way.  Petar Zivkovski, director of operations for leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, summed the platform’s situation up by calling its growth ""lackluster"".  ""Recent events [have] majorly undermined its attractiveness to new money and new developers,"" he told CoinDesk.  Amid the challenges, ether prices have been experiencing ""a long, downward trend,"" said algorithmic trader Jacob Eliosoff.  Yet, he stressed that the recent dip below $6 was only temporary, as ether prices surpassed $8 on 7th December and reached a weekly high of $8.86 the following day, CoinMarketCap data shows.  Bitcoin remains buoyant  But while ether has recovered over the last few days, bitcoin continually exceeded $770 during the week, putting the digital currency firmly within reach of surpassing its annual high of $781.31.  At the time of reporting, bitcoin prices had reached as much as $772.47 in the past seven days, according to BPI figures.  Both Zivkovski and Enneking credited China and India with helping fuel these price gains – the former nation provoking the concern of its citizens by imposing capital controls and repeatedly taking steps to devalue the yuan.  While such macroeconomic events helped drive bitcoin prices higher, the digital currency also benefited from growing enthusiasm, Zivkovski told CoinDesk.  There has been ""a spike in interest in bitcoin around the world and an unprecedented transfer of wealth from altcoins to bitcoin"", he said, adding:  ""This indicates that investors in cryptocurrency do not feel they've been rewarded well for the risk they've taken investing in altcoins over the past few years and are now looking for a less risky (albeit still risky) alternative.""  In spite of the digital currency's resilience, Eliosoff provided a cautionary note, emphasizing that he is unsure who exactly is purchasing bitcoin at its recent values.  ""My guess is the usual, Chinese investors seeking store-of-value, but if there's data to support it their Indian counterparts may be playing a role too,"" he told CoinDesk.  Bullish sentiment  Even though bitcoin has been repeatedly nearing its annual high, there is evidence that traders are rather bullish about the digital currency's future prospects.  The market has been more than 80% long in the 30-day, 60-day and 90-day periods through 9th December, Whaleclub data reveals. The market has been particularly bullish over the last week, as it was 88% long during the seven days through 9th December.  ""In aggregate, the average holding time for long positions has almost tripled in the past three months alone,"" said Zivkovski.  He said:  ""This indicates that traders see little downside and have a longer bullish time horizon with respect to bitcoin.""  He added that, while there are bearish wagers, these bets are more rare. ""We do see large shorts come in occasionally, but they are held almost 25 times less time than longs.""  As bitcoin continues to obtain greater adoption, this growing acceptance could combine with heavily bullish sentiment to fuel some impressive gains.
