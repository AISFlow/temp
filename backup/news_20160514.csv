42426862,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxJrh,1463227949,Bitcoin Core is Seeking to Overhaul How it Upgrades its Code,"The Bitcoin Core team is looking to refresh the process by which code changes are proposed, considered and implemented in a bid to engage more people in the development of the protocol.  But this remains a significant challenge in a diverse and distributed community.  The current process goes like this: If a community member has an idea for an update, he or she proposes it to the group by sending a description through a public mailing list. If enough people think the update is worth deploying, a Bitcoin Improvement Process (BIP) document is created and posted to the bitcoin GitHub. That document can then be commented on further by the community.  Once the document has ""rough consensus"" – defined as the general sense that everyone more or less is on board with the idea – it gets merged into the reference client, although it’s still pending review at that point.  ""One of the requirements for a BIP is there needs to be an implementation for it,"" said Eric Lombrozo, chief technology officer at Ciphrex and Bitcoin Core spokesperson.  He added:  ""Someone can’t just say I would love this new feature. They must demonstrate that it works and can be done.""  Democratizing access  This process can be rather hectic since every step is public. Plus, people are regularly introducing ideas that are at differing levels of abstraction. For instance, some proposals would require full support from the network while others aren’t mandatory. Others would require changing the code entirely.  If the proposal will change consensus rules, or how the network validates blocks on its distributed ledger, it undergoes quite a bit of review. There have been several of these soft forks, and many of them have not been particularly controversial.  For instance, BIP 65 added a new feature to the codebase which allows users to lock bitcoins up for a certain amount of time. The block size codebase change was really the first time the community was so passionately split on what should be deployed.  For these types of changes, Bitcoin Core gets the final say in what is deployed. It's a judgment call on the team's part, but Lombrozo said the group of a couple dozen Core developers wouldn't want to deploy a change that wouldn't get full support.  Changes that are not as profound do not have to go through such a strict review. These application-level BIPs such as features for key storage can be implemented quicker. Lombrozo wants to speed up that process even more, letting good features develop organically based on popularity.  ""We want to create an informed space for people to participate in,"" said Pindar Wong, chairman of VeriFi Inc, a FinTech infrastructure consultancy and a member of the W3C’s Web Payments Community Group.  ""Proof of work applies to the bitcoin community at large and not just the consensus algorithm, and we need to find a way to engage these people,"" he continued.  Barriers to entry  But engagement can be difficult, as it requires balancing people’s enthusiasm and experience in working on technical standards.  One thing Lombrozo thinks will help is opening up other communication channels that most people are familiar with. Currently most bitcoin technical discussions happen through Internet Relay Chat (IRC), a messaging protocol long used by developers. IRC use declined significantly after the 1990s as people moved to modern messaging and social media platforms, such as Facebook and now, Slack.  ""The big problem that happened earlier ... was that people didn’t know how to get to the discussions,"" Lombrozo said.  Lombrozo indicated that Bitcoin Core today operates on a merit system that is predominantly reputation-based, meaning those who have contributed more have more say.  But since the launch of a competing development effort, Bitcoin Classic, at the start of this year, Core has sought to open up its processes. The Bitcoin Core team has set up a Slack group, and Lombrozo hopes to find people interested in summarizing forum discussions so people that did not participate in real time can get a synopsis without all the technical minutiae.  The next step is developing a system that allows people from all different levels of interest and know-how to participate in the discussions without bogging down the development process.  To do this, Lombrozo wants to structure the process better to differentiate between different types of proposals. Currently there are three kinds of BIPs – a standards track BIP, which affects most or all bitcoin implementations; an informational BIP, which describes design issues; and a process BIP, which doesn’t affect bitcoin’s codebase but typically needs community approval still.  Today, most BIP proposals come from developers and engineers. A few come from bitcoin companies that have products or services that would benefit from the addition of certain features.  According to Lombrozo, there a couple dozen active participants in this process, although that changes over time. Overall, hundreds of people have contributed to Bitcoin Core’s nearly 145 different BIP proposals, he said.  Taking inspiration  Yet, bitcoin is still in its infancy and developing standards on an open-source protocol without a strict process is challenging, which is why professional standards organizations like the W3C have typically dealt with this aspect of governance.  Not only that, but these institutions have full-time developers on staff that are knowledgeable about the tech and the standards processes. And these groups have the support of large enterprises which send experts to work on the standards.  Yet the W3C’s web payments work has recently come under fire from some of its members after the large browser vendors – namely Google and Microsoft – seemed to exert undue control over the process. This made several members wonder whether they, too, could learn from bitcoin’s method of development and standardization.  Wong, who’s been a bitcoin enthusiast for some time, was one of those members. He believes it might be time to reinvent the standards process to make sure the Internet remains open and large enterprises don’t take over the experience for all users.  Since the contention within the W3C’s web payments work, Wong has been thinking about how best to develop technology standards.  ""Do you need to reinvent processes or can you modify legacy processes?"" Wong asks.  Sometimes it’s one. Sometimes it’s the other. And sometimes, it’s a little bit of both.  Developer Amir Taaki, a well-known yet controversial anarchist figure in the cryptocurrency space, modeled the BIP process on Python PEP-0001. And the Bitcoin Core team has been looking at other standards bodies to develop better methods on top. For instance, the next consensus rule change will make implementing BIPs and pushing those updates to miners more seamless.  But the process isn’t perfect yet. Building consensus within all bitcoin’s key groups – businesses, investors, developers, consumers – is still a struggle, one that’s particularly laborious from the engineering perspective because there isn’t a specific problem for which they’re trying to solve.  Wong argues that it won’t ever be. ""These aren’t static environments and so that inputs the question of adaptability,"" he said.  In defense of the ecosystem, he positioned the acrimonious climate as perhaps a sign of the community’s strength and resilience, concluding:  ""All this conflict, get over it. It’s healthy.""

42426864,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxJvh,1463221624,Why Out-of-Hospital Blockchains Matter,"Cyrus Maaghul is a blockchain innovation advisor and the head of product at healthcare platform startup PointNurse.  In this opinion piece, Maaghul discusses what he sees as the potential applications for blockchain in the field of healthcare, an area increasingly of interest to industry firms.  I bought my first bitcoin in May 2013 while on a vegan retreat in Asheville, North Carolina. Going through the purchase process reminded me of when I first downloaded Mosaic and surfed the net. I thought to myself, ""this is going to be a game changer"". It was.  Bitcoin and blockchain technology will be game changers, too.  Bitcoin, its underlying blockchain and evolving peer-to-peer networks with Turing-complete smart contracts such as Ethereum will have a disruptive impact on many industries for years to come. Financial services, payments, supply chain logistics, insurance, and healthcare are just a few that will be disrupted with these new technologies.  Out-of-hospital blockchains  Healthcare will be a primary beneficiary of these new technologies, especially outside of the walls of hospitals.  As more and more health and preventive care is provisioned in virtual environments, at home, in cars, at work, etc, the need for open and accessible tracking, verifying and provisioning of care will become extremely critical for patients, payors, providers, scientists and regulators.  These new out-of-hospital (OOH) blockchains developed in the non-clinical community will set the pace for how patient behavioral and inter-clinic visit vital data is tracked in the future for provider reimbursement, regulatory compliance, safety monitoring and patient adherence.  The blockchain is a near-perfect technology (not necessarily the current implementations) to securely and safely make OOH data easily accessible with relatively minimal privacy and hack risk to all patient stakeholders, including the patient themselves, family, caregivers, clinics, providers, insurance companies and all those with a stake in their patients’ health.  Each and every one of these stakeholders or network peers approved by the patient can easily join OOH blockchains as either nodes or buyer or seller of tokens or payments to gain access to patient data, utilizing a variety of open access methods and smart contracts that store and monitor real-time contractual conditions agreed to by and between various stakeholders.  There will be many OOH blockchains developed to address the myriad of use cases in healthcare, including tracking the development of drugs, doctor and nurses credentialing, real-time population health data analysis and alerts, insurance peer-to-peer risk pooling, telemedicine and home health visit data sharing, decentralized autonomous organizations, verification and audits, and remote device monitoring commonly addressed today under the Internet of Things category.  These open and viable peer-to-peer healthcare blockchains will open the door to new business models in healthcare, including analytics-for-healthcare products and services, flash malpractice insurance and friction-less claims processing hence shorter revenue cycles.  Healthcare insurance claims processing  It is no secret that healthcare claims processing is a nightmare for all parties involved. Reimbursement is opaque, fraud is prevalent, and transactions frequently difficult to reconcile.  For example, home health, a great OOH blockchain example, is possibly one of the greatest sources of fraud in the US healthcare industry today. Smart contracts powered by a blockchain could provide consumers and payors with the means to manage claims in a transparent, immutable and responsive fashion.  Insurance contracts, premium payments and their respective claims could be recorded onto a blockchain and validated by node consensus, preventing fraudulent claims from being processed. Smart contracts could enforce claims triggering payments when due or dispatching specialists, nurses or doctors to follow up with patients when anticipated claims are not recorded by presumptive dates.  Managing ""super-utilizers""  The term super-utilizer describes individuals whose complex physical, behavioral and social needs are not well met through the current fragmented health care system.  These individuals go from emergency room to emergency room, to admission and re-admission, in a chaotic and costly manner. Mental health, substance abuse, poverty and education are frequently cited as common characteristics of many but not all in this group. Many researchers and experts postulate how more ""community support"" and ""real-time engagement"" is needed to manage this socially isolated population of healthcare super-utilizing consumers.  Smart contracts powered by an OOH blockchain utilizing the bitcoin payment system could be used to create a rewards and incentive system to manage super utilizer behavior.  Behavioral contracts could be developed between payor and patient to trigger rewards denominated in BTC for attending support groups, regularly engaging a telehealth professional, reporting health conditions (possibly at kiosks with bitcoin point-of-care devices), and meeting agreed upon health goals.  Payors would fund reward payouts via efficient BTC accounts established at commercial digital currency exchanges. A smart contract would trigger a reward payment (or loss) when goals are met near real-time to the patient’s public bitcoin address which in turn could be tendered at local participating outlets equipped with BTC point-of-contact devices including community centers, supermarkets and apartment complexes to pay bills, purchase healthy foods and meet rent obligations.  Medical malpractice insurance DAOs  In theory, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are entities that are self-governing. DAOs on a OOH blockchain could enable trust and provide an immutable record and audit trail of an agreement without a single controlling body.  Doctors and nurse practitioners could collaborate to establish a peer-to-peer malpractice DAO and record each peer's premium payments and claims on the blockchain. All premiums paid in would create a pool of capital to pay claims.  By combining the blockchain with the peer-to-peer business model, this creates the potential for a near-autonomous self-regulated insurance business model for managing policy and claims. No single entity would control the network. Policyholders could ""equally"" control the network on a pro-rata basis.  But, these are just a few examples of how bitcoin and blockchain technology will change the face of healthcare in the future.  The blockchain is a new and exciting technology, and we are now just beginning to see both small and large players dip their toes into the water. I personally would discourage any entrepreneur from pursuing the use of blockchain technology inside the walls of clinics and hospitals today, as the those lanes are laden with painful obstacles – the OOH blockchain is your winning lane today.
