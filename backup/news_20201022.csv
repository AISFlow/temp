42384973,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAmPJT,1603398464,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Sticks Around $13K While Ether Locked in DeFi Dips,"Bitcoin stays in bull mode but on lower volume while the amount of ether locked in DeFi falls.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $13,103 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 3% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $12,685-$13,232  BTC above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price is still trending upward, hitting as high as $13,232 on spot exchanges the past 24 hours. It was at $13,103 as of press time, leveling off a bit after hitting 2020 highs.      Read More: Back at $13K: Bitcoin Unfazed by Profit Takers After Rise to 2020 High      “Bitcoin is naturally taking a breather after yesterday's spike,” said Elie Le Rest, an executive for quant trading firm ExoAlpha. “The critical level to hold is $12,500-ish, thus turning previous resistance into support.” The last time the world’s oldest cryptocurrency held these price levels was way back on July 10, 2019.      “We could, however, see a sideways period in the coming days, even a mild pullback, but bitcoin seems to have established a new base here,” Le Rest added.      Bitcoin at “$13,000 was near a prior high, so it's a natural place to pull in for a pit stop,” said Bill Noble, chief technical analyst at Token Metrics. “BTC has started an uptrend, so it can stay here to build up steam for the next big move.”      Volume may be a key component to further upward price action. Thursday’s daily volume was at $688,966,174 for major USD/BTC spot exchanges as of press time. That’s starkly lower than on Wednesday, which at $1,578,271,994 was the highest volume day since July 28.      Some of that volume Wednesday likely came from developments in bitcoin adoption news as PayPal plans to support cryptocurrencies for its 346 million users within a few weeks.      Karl Samsen, executive vice president of capital markets for trading firm Global Digital Assets, said he is optimistic further bullish news on investment firms buying bitcoin could develop. “The money that matters to bitcoin’s intended growth is more on notice than it has ever been before,” Samsen told CoinDesk. “The PayPal adoption almost forces asset managers to make BTC part of their allocation.”      Read More: Hedge Fund Billionaire Tudor Jones Says Bitcoin Rally Only in ‘First Inning’      It’s possible asset managers have already noticed, according to William Purdy, a derivatives trader and founder of analysis firm Purdy Alerts. He pointed to the upward trend of bitcoin futures, at a high not seen since the start of September.      “Institutional interest is usually slow-moving, so that high is a good sign of trend strength and interest with actual capital placement in BTC futures,” Purdy told CoinDesk.      Alex Mashinsky, CEO of crypto lender Celsius Network, said bitcoin could dip in the near term but more record highs are in store. “BTC will re-test $12,000 levels to see if the PayPal news is just a pump and dump or a new wave of adoption, which will take us to new highs before the end of the year.”    Ether dominance slips    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was up in Thursday trading around $417 and climbing 6.3% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      The amount of ether locked in decentralized finance, or DeFi, is declining. After hitting a one-month high of 9.2 million ETH on Oct. 20, the amount began ticking down Wednesday, dipping to 9 million.      Marc Fluery, chief executive officer of crypto asset manager Two Prime, said the decline is just a market blip despite the drop and other metrics like ether dominance also falling.      “Ether, far from its blockchain narrative of 2017 [initial coin offerings], has proven a viable financial store of value, just like bitcoin, really,” said Fluery. “While ETH dominance is dropping, we believe that the brand is established and that, in a market where brand awareness and the linguistics of popularity are everything, ETH will continue to do well and be a dominant force in the ecosystem.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are all green Thursday.

42384960,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAmP0b,1603397733,"A Guide to Circles, the Project Bringing UBI and FOMO to Ethereum's xDai Sidechain","Free money always makes the crypto world go mad, even if people don't know what the new cryptocurrency will be worth or what it's good for.      The case is being proven out again with Circles, a blockchain-based universal basic income (UBI) project that launched Oct. 16 on Ethereum's xDai sidechain.      Founded by Martin Köppelmann of Gnosis and run by a very small, Berlin-based team, Circles promises to give users 240 of its CRC cryptocurrency each month, but it puts up one hurdle to get started: The user needs to find three people who are already inside and convince them to form a ""trust"" line from their Circles wallet to that of Circles' aspirants.      It's a way of creating a parallel economy.      For anyone decently networked in crypto, especially within Ethereum, this seems quite easy. The truth is, however, Circles has been very slow and buggy so far.      ""We are quite busy,"" Blanka Vay of the Circles team told CoinDesk when reached by email. ""Our servers are down because of the huge interest.""      As a post from the official account in the Circles Telegram channel put it Wednesday:      ""We're facing heavy infrastructure problems with a naive server setup and 70 million requests per 24 hours. … We're working hard on improving it so the app runs more stable.""    Traffic jam    Andrew Gross, of the POA Network, which runs xDai, said the Circles launch has led to one of the biggest transaction surges the network has ever seen.      To be fair, Circles and cryptic space game Dark Forest are running neck and neck for driving the biggest transaction spikes on xDai, though Gross noted the sidechain is still running well below capacity. The bugginess seems to be more with Circles' APIs.    Circles functions from the ground up differently than other cryptocurrency projects. Its white paperhttps://handbook.joincircles.net/about/whitepaper.html describes how funds move through the network in a social fashion rather than a technological one. Circles is a true social network for value.    Somewhat like the Lightning Network, value moves through Circles via trust lines. This is important. Circles is meant more to inculcate communities of cooperation, not to transfer billions of dollars around the globe, like Bitcoin can.      Members of the Circles development team have told CoinDesk they are working to scale up and switch to infrastructure that can better handle this unanticipated growth. This has been frustrating for new users, but you can think of your frustration as similar to the computational energy required to mine fresh bitcoin.      Perhaps it's good that an endless faucet of free crypto has some pretty significant friction to get started. The friction only requires patience, not funds, so it's not financially exclusionary, even if the initial set of trusted parties represent a privileged class. It's spreading fast, so every day it should be easier to join – technical glitches aside.    Pro tips    But for those struggling to get in, I've learned a few things about how Circles works over the 24-hour period I spent trying to get on. Hopefully, this will help others:      Just keep trying. There's been a lot of talk in my Slack channels and with folks I know on WhatsApp about spinny wheels of death. It seems like the spinny circles on Circles don't mean much. Try to join, give it a minute and then try again. Try again every few hours. Also, dropping ad blockers seemed to help.      Reformat your seed phrase when saving it. Definitely save your seed phrase, because it lets you log in through other browsers, but reformat it so it's a sentence. When I copied and pasted my words they pasted as a list. To log in again, you want them in a sentence format, separated by spaces.      Reloading your wallet can help. In cases where verifications aren't showing up or transactions aren't working, rebooting wallets can help. Before my account became verified, the only way I could find to do this was by clearing the history on my browser. Once an account is verified, though, click on the hamburger menu, go to settings and click the scary red ""End Session"" button. Note: Do not click it if your seed phrase hasn't been backed up.      Circles is weird about emails. If you get a spinny wheel at the account-creation stage where it asks for an email, search your screen. It might be saying it doesn't like your email. Two of mine were rejected and it only liked my shady email from an obscure German company that I only use to hide from Mark Zuckerberg. It rejected my long-standing, well-established Gmail address. I have no clue why.      Find real people who actually know you. This could be hard for some crypto n00bs but just try to work your network and find folks you have encountered for real or make new online friends. Think of this as your little bit of ""social mining."" You can just shamelessly beg randos on Twitter but you're not building social capital that way. If it takes a little longer making it real, so be it. We each have the personal network we have earned.      Verifications take forever to register. Circles showed me at two verifications for hours when I knew I had three (others have taken even longer). Then, when I got in, I didn't have verifications from anyone who had actually told me they were going to do it. I had them from people I'd asked who hadn't directly responded. I think this is because people thought they had verified my account but the push didn't make it through. So it goes.      Verifying others isn't any better. So if you get to the point where you can verify others, just do one person at a time. I got a spinny wheel and then the home screen popped up and a message briefly appeared saying I had verified them. I think I have verified people several times but it's really hard to say. The early days of new cryptocurrencies are very exciting.      Return the trust. If someone trusts you, you need to trust them back (so long as you do). Right now it doesn't show the name of users half the time so this can be tedious, but once that gets easier look at all the people who have trusted you, click on their profiles and return the favor. It's like Twitter: double opt-in for real connection.      Just use one machine as you start. I've been bouncing between two laptops and my mobile. Circles does not seem to like that, and that makes sense with the system under strain. So pick where you want to get started and just stick with that until Circles manages to scale up.      If anyone manages to send CRC, let me know. For my first couple days in I was not able to give away any of my funds, even among the mutually trusted. Whether CRC proves to have real-world usefulness is up to everyone who does manage to get the faucets turned on.      Hopefully, these tips should help those people determined to get in to get in faster.

It is ""unclear"" if PayPal's earnings will benefit from that shift. The researchers said bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin and ether funding is ""likely immaterial to earnings.""  ""Assuming PayPal is able to scale its crypto trading activity to Square's current level, it would only add [0.3%] of growth to PayPal's ~$21.3 billion"" revenue base for 2020, they wrote.

42384971,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAmPER,1603384526,Three Trends Killing Web Privacy and Decentralization,"The World Wide Web has revolutionized human communication, but it’s under threat.      We at Brave think this distributed and interlinked information system is unique among platforms for many reasons: Its design and direction aren’t controlled by any one organization. Its pages and applications are modifiable by users (e.g., extensions, ad/tracker blocking, more general browser configuration, etc). And its decentralized design gives the web the potential to be more privacy-preserving than any other system.    Brendan Eich, is the CEO and co-founder of Brave. Peter Snyder is a senior privacy researcher at Brave. This article is part of CoinDesk's ""Internet 2030"" series.    Brave may be best known for protecting privacy on the web today, but we’re concerned with long-range trends, too, particularly those that could weaken, or effectively end, its decentralized nature. And while it is difficult to build privacy-preserving decentralized systems, preserving privacy on the web will become even more difficult as more and more control is centralized in fewer organizations.      We’d like to describe three threats to the web’s decentralization, and explain why we think they should concern everyone.    Centralization in content distribution    The growth of centralized distribution systems is harmful to web decentralization. More specifically, while we’re concerned about more and more of the web being served from fewer and fewer CDNs [content delivery networks], we’re especially concerned about systems like Google’s AMP or a potential WebPackaging based AMP follow-up, which impose design decisions on publishers (and so, indirectly, on other browsers, too).    Privacy and decentralization are mutually supporting aims    The more of the web that is served from a single party, using a format designed primarily by a single party, the fewer voices and goals end up in future design of the web. And while Web 3.0 cannot ensure that the web reflects a broad range of uses and needs, a centralized web nearly ensures it won't.    Consent management systems and delayed alternatives    We think it’s obvious that the future of the web is privacy-by-default: Privacy-focused tools like Brave are rapidly growing in popularity, and legislation like the GDPR and CCPA increasingly recognize that people have a right to privacy. However, the proposals from tracking companies on how current systems can be maintained are tragicomically complicated, piling layers and layers of machinery on top of outdated, user-harmful systems to try and resist change.      See also: Privacy Laws Are Only as Effective as the Companies Implementing Them      The existing, centralized, surveillance economy is making last-ditch efforts to slow down privacy as much as it can. Systems like the Orwellian-named “consent management platforms” offer to store information about what kinds of tracking users “consent to,” often through dialogs riddled with dark patterns and inscrutable descriptions, designed to trick, confuse or exhaust users into “consenting.”      These systems are harmful to the goal of a privacy-preserving decentralized web because they slow progress and speed regress. To anyone paying attention, the future isn't in massive databases collecting quasi-consent signals to excuse privacy violations. The future of the web is in privacy-by-default, and the sooner the surveillance economy recognizes the inevitable, the faster we can advance.    Centralized profile building    Finally, we think the current, widespread practice of collecting and building profiles of people (both on and off the web) is antithetical to the underlying goals of decentralization, in addition to being unethical.      Centralized profile building increases the incentive for sites to track you, essentially to ""monetize"" your data by selling it to data brokers. The scope and risks of decisions made on the web are difficult for users to predict, and generally puts trackers and data brokers in positions of enormous, unaccountable power. At the limit, this leads to psychological warfare campaigns via ad campaigns and promoted “user-generated"" content.      Here, privacy and decentralization are mutually supporting aims. Improving privacy will reduce the ""usefulness"" of user profiles, thereby decreasing the ability of trackers to centralize power on the web. Likewise, a decentralized web, where no single party can track you, will make it much more difficult for the data collectors to violate your privacy in the first place, in order to achieve monopoly or market power.

Ant Group is continuing to research and release blockchain-based services. And what people are saying following PayPal's crypto market entrance.    Top shelf    Bitcoin buys Following a wave of institutional bitcoin buys, crypto custodian Hex Trust and multinational payments gateway Sia have partnered to provide an easier path for banks to hold digital assets. Announced Thursday, Hex Trust will offer custodial software to banks, through Sia, to enable them to hold bitcoin, security tokens and central bank digital currencies for their banking clients. Currently, Hex Trust works with three banks – Mason Privatbank Liechtenstein AG and two unnamed Asian banks. Hex Trust CEO Alessio Quaglini said the firm has 10 other banks that are exploring the custodian’s products.      Bitcoin DeFi? Hodl Hodl, a non-custodial bitcoin exchange, is launching a lending product seeking status as “the first true bitcoin DeFi” product. Users will be able to borrow USDT, USDC, PAX or DAI stablecoins in a peer-to-peer fashion, without going through know-your-customer (KYC) procedures, leaving their bitcoin as collateral. Hodl Hodl’s Lend marketplace will not act as a custodian and won’t store bitcoin collateral, instead opting for a multisig setup where lender, borrower and Lend each get a key. The lender and the borrower will agree on the amount, time period, interest rate of the loan and the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, which can be anywhere between 30% and 70%. Lend will take a 2% commission from each deal.      Token merger Voyager Digital, a publicly traded digital asset brokerage, has agreed to buy LGO, an institutional-focused crypto exchange. As part of the merger, which is awaiting regulatory approval, the companies will merge their two utility tokens, VGX and LGO, for newly minted tokens featuring decentralized finance (DeFi) functions such as community governance and staking at an initial interest rate of 7%. “We think this is really taking the old-school mergers and acquisitions to the token world, which hasn’t been done before,” Steve Enrlich, Voyager’s CEO said. Upon completion, Voyager will issue one million shares for the acquisition and operate in the European retail market with LGO’s Virtual Asset Service Provider registration.      Stablecoin interoperability Austria-headquartered Raiffeisen Bank International (RBI) is piloting an interoperability tool designed to connect tokenized fiat currencies (read: stablecoins) to multiple blockchains. The initiative will see the bank's RBI Coin integrated with the Pantos blockchain interoperability tool from Vienna-based cryptocurrency exchange Bitpanda, according to a press release on Thursday. RBI Coin facilitates near-instant payments between banks and businesses. Raiffeisen hopes the proof-of-concept will eventually lead the banking industry to become ""technology-agnostic in the field of fast-changing blockchain technologies.”      Ant’s efforts Ant Group has unveiled a new blockchain-based service for copyright claims. Built on the AntChain network and using AI technology, the digital copyright platform allows creators to ""quickly authenticate and verify a variety of original works,"" the company said in a press release, by providing search tools, a method of analyzing for original content and a system of ""unique digital copyright certification[s]"" containing information about the work. These notarized, and ""tamper-proof,"" certifications could be submitted as evidence in copyright infringement and tort disputes.

In the wake of charges brought against BitMEX, a bitcoin derivatives exchange that operated for nearly its entire existence without know-your-customer (KYC) requirements, the topic of financial privacy and splinter economies has never been more heightened.      In crypto, the privacy debate is often waged between originalists, who view these cryptographic monies as a means to transact, no questions asked, and the mainliners, who are willing to sacrifice some of crypto’s independence to reach the mainstage of the global economy.      CoinDesk’s Ian Allison explored this divide yesterday in an article rounding up reactions to PayPal’s crypto market entrance. In offering crypto trading and transactional services to a pool of 346 million users and 26 million merchants, the fintech giant will require full KYC and inhibit self-custody.      “Yes, if you’re a pure libertarian, it’s not ideal. But being pragmatic about bitcoin’s trajectory and global adoption penetration rate, this certainly brings more options,” said Charles Hayter, CEO and co-founder of data site CryptoCompare.      PayPal is not alone. Deribit, the largest crypto options exchange by trading volume, recently decided to implement mandatory ID verifications by year’s end. Users will now be required to submit government-issued photo identification, as well as a proof of residence.      This follows on BitMEX’s announcement to accelerate its own planned KYC program. Charged by the U.S. government with facilitating unregistered trading, BitMEX said all of its customers would need to verify their identities by Nov. 5, three months earlier than the original deadline.      Opposingly, today Hodl Hodl unveiled a product that will enable KYC-less, P2P lending, bucking the trend of payment and lending firms to require users to register using their real identities.      While not a perfect analogy, perhaps one way this battle will shake out follows from reactions to the Financial Action Task Force’s “Travel Rule.” Coinciding with CoinDesk’s Consensus: Distributed conference, analysts assessed the knock-on effects of these anti-money laundering financial regulations on tools designed to eschew national borders and mandates.      Speaking at a panel discussion, Bakkt President Adam White said most crypto companies will fall in line – though there will always be a contingent that stands apart. If that happens, there could be a viable “gray market” between the regulated and unregulated, verified and unverified, and KYC’d and non-KYC’d.

42384952,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAmMBj,1603382440,We Still Lack a Rational Way to Value Tokens,"We’re obsessed with wanting to draw rational relationships between the price of crypto tokens and the value behind them. There is no shortage of viewpoints from analysts, entrepreneurs, developers, pundits or investors on this question. Just google “crypto tokens valuation metrics” and you will see the variety of what has been written so far on this topic.      My own last attempt was from September 2019, as I enumerated nine different variables for measuring the health of cryptocurrencies and tokens. But I didn’t profess to have cracked the code on a magical formula, or to have found the magical equation that would become the telling star for these valuations.    William Mougayar is the author of “The Business Blockchain,” producer of the Token Summit and a venture investor and adviser.    As I lamented in 2017 in “The Darkness Side and Long Honeymoons of Token Sales,” we are in dire need of fundamental metrics that equate to how publicly traded companies are routinely valued.      In public companies, analysts and investors use metrics such as revenue, net income, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), EPS (earnings per share), P/E ratio (price to earnings ratio) and sales growth in order to correlate market capitalization justifications.      For ICOs and token-based projects, what are the equivalent performance metrics?      At the end of 2017, as token users started to surpass the number of token speculators, we hoped usage activity would prevail as the mainstay of token valuations. Fast forward to today, three years later, and we find ourselves back to square one.      Two promising blockchain metrics have struggled to assert themselves because they failed the test of time.      See also: Nico Cordeiro - Why the Stock-to-Flow Bitcoin Valuation Model Is Wrong      First, take gas fees on the Ethereum network. As the network became more popular (a good thing) it also became slower (a bad thing), resulting in increased gas fees to run the variety of smart contracts. The interpretation of the increased gas fees became a point of contention.      On one hand, increased gas fees count as part of “network revenue” (a good thing). But on the other hand, it also meant that each given transaction became too expensive to run on the Ethereum network (a bad thing), and that forced some use cases to consider either moving to Ethereum side chains or other chains (a bad thing for Ethereum).      What did the ethereum token price do during this period? First it went up, then it went back down. But it was very hard to establish a real correlation via any type of equation or quantitative measure that could be followed reliably.      Second, take DeFi, a sector that has an aggressive growth trajectory. As recently as July it was commonly accepted that the DeFi Total Value Locked (TVL) was a good indicator for the valuation of the DeFi market. As TVL continued to grow, so did the total market cap of the top DeFi tokens.    I believe we are still in the era of qualitative crypto tokens valuation, where the price of tokens is primarily driven by speculative perceptions, brand value and creator promises.    Then the correlation broke down. As I wrote in CoinDesk in early September, the total DeFi market cap was hovering at $16 billion. Today, it is about $12 billion.      One could justify this pullback by citing traditional market behavioral dynamics that typically price underlying instruments ahead of expectations but deflate themselves after the news has been made public. That is a common psychological yin and yang in markets behavior. Perhaps that was the case here.      That said, keep in mind the DeFi “TVL-to-market cap” relationship I cited above draws on “macro” metrics based on the health of the entire segment, and that is a lot easier to quantify than trying to apply metrics to individual tokens based on their own intrinsics. Good luck in trying to translate the macro view at individual token correlation level.      See also: Ethereum Developers Weigh Gas Rule Change to Ease Fee Pressure      In addition, DeFi had a peculiarly artificial reality. The price of many tokens was often driven by automated market maker algorithms that do not factor in prior judgment or knowledge about usage metrics and, rather, derive their core from a given demand/supply dynamic curve and the presence of a variable liquidity pool. Tight liquidity/float pools create artificial price points that need to be tested over time.      This leaves me to conclude that, in the absence of correlatable metrics, we are only left with vanity metrics, or perhaps just “input-type” data points that could one day find their way into some set of correlative equations that will make sense.      The other peculiar anomaly between traditional stocks and crypto markets is that in crypto markets the same currency that has actual (user) utility is the one that investors/speculators partake in owning. This is in contrast to stocks that are just a unit of account but cannot be used to purchase related products or services from the underlying issuer.      See also: William Mougayar - For DeFi to Grow, CeFi Must Embrace It      You would think that this should give room for an even tighter correlation to emerge between usage and value, but that hasn’t happened yet, at least not in a way where we can start to build a body of support behind it.      Of course, we still have hope that one day the usage of highly popular cryptocurrencies (whether via user or developer traffic) would append and dictate the actual value trajectory of the underlying token, but that day is yet to come.      Imagine if you were mandated to pay for charging your Tesla via a fraction of a Tesla stock. In essence, you would need to keep buying Tesla stock (therefore creating demand for Tesla stock and contributing to its eventual rise) to pay for an electric charge (excluding from your own charging station at home for example).      Of course, as the Tesla stock price goes up your actual cost for charging would go down, and that would be a good thing. If for some reason Tesla owners stopped driving their cars, the ensuing decrease in activity would result in less demand for Tesla stock/currency and its price would dwindle accordingly. But at least there would be a real linkage between usage and demand, something that is natively intrinsic to crypto tokens.      In the blockchain space, on-chain fees/revenue still hold a good promise for being a leading indicator of blockchain network value. Ethereum has a proposal for making the fees schedule more dynamic (EIP 1559 and Fee Structure), which promises to make payments more equitable but also potentially more difficult to correlate. That is certainly a development area to watch.      My friend Evan Van Ness aptly called a number of chains “Zombie Chains,” based on the little number of transactions that actually pass through them. That is an example of negative metric correlation that is nonetheless logical and easy to understand or validate.      We continue to be in the early stages of finding correlation metrics between crypto tokens value and usage.      For this reason, I believe we are still in the era of qualitative crypto tokens valuation, where the price of tokens is primarily driven by speculative perceptions, brand value and creator promises.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,William Mougayar,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/10/22/we-still-lack-a-rational-way-to-value-tokens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ed1363c6d1fdd2c44a94c95592a5185ea79182d8-1420x947.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384946,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAmM5R,1603382001,"Lossless Lottery PoolTogether Opens Up to More Coins, More Prizes","More games with no losers are coming to Ethereum (kind of).      PoolTogether, the lossless lottery on Ethereum that's meant to gamify savings, is releasing its v3 today at 16:00 UTC. The site, first launched in June 2019, makes it so one player wins all the yield earned on many people's deposits in a pool, but everyone keeps their initial deposits. That's why it is called ""lossless."" So far there have only been two pools, though, one using MakerDAO's dai stablecoin, and the other using CENTRE's USDC.      That's all set to change with v3, which will enable lots more ERC-20 tokens, more yield sources and more prize distribution schemes.      ""The thing they all have in common is they are no-loss, you can withdraw your money any time and they have prizes. That's the commonality, but they have all sorts of variations,"" PoolTogether founder Leighton Cusack told CoinDesk in a phone call.      Perhaps v3's most important feature, however, is that it will enable outsiders to create new pools with their own rules.    New funding    In order to complete its third version, PoolTogether raised a little over $1 million in a seed extension round led by ParaFi Capital, with additional participation from Robot Ventures, OpenLaw's The LAO, the MetaCartel DAO and a few angels, including Synthetix's Kain Warwick and Aave's Stani Kulechov.      Ben Forman of ParaFi Capital told CoinDesk in an email:    ""No-loss lotteries are an underexplored and compelling alternative to high yield savings accounts. It's a prime example of a use case that functions more elegantly on a blockchain vs. traditional financial infrastructure.""    In that way, PoolTogether makes for a good entry point into decentralized finance (DeFi) and crypto.      Read more: PoolTogether DeFi App Announces $1M Investment After No-Loss Lottery Payout Tops $1K      ""Everyone is familiar with the concept of a lottery,"" Dan Elitzer, an investor at a new venture firm called Nascent and one of the instigators of Yam Finance, told CoinDesk via direct message. He described PoolTogether as ""a product that gives a thrill like playing a lottery, while encouraging savings and making sure users don't lose money.""    New version    As of Thursday, there will only be one pool on the PoolTogether website, a dai pool. Once the prize for the dai pool has enough deposits for supporting a $10,000 prize (Cusack estimates this at about $8 million), there will be a community vote on what pools to add first.      But that's only what's on the PoolTogether website. Also launched today is PoolToether Build, a way that anyone can construct additional pools with their own unique prize strategies.      Also with v3, the pools move toward decentralization. New pools will no longer be controllable by the PoolTogether team. No one who creates a pool will be able to touch users' deposits in those pools. This is all part of the process for PoolTogether to get to full decentralization.      Read more: With COMP Below $100, a Look Back at the ‘DeFi Summer’ It Sparked      Coming out of DeFi Summer, Cusack saw outsize returns going to lots of other projects and it was hard to drive as much excitement toward PoolTogether's model. On the other hand, because the team has been conservative and careful the project also hasn't had any adverse events, such as users losing funds.      ""There's some jealousy when you see a protocol launch and see $100 million in it in two days,"" Cusack said. ""At the end of the day, I think a lot of that buzz is dying off.""      So now that the degen spirit has died down, Cusack believes the reputation PoolTogether has built since launch will pay off.      ""Products that are going to stick around are going to prioritize security and safety and more sustainable methods,"" Cusack said.    Pool builders    PoolTogether the company will retain control over the PoolTogether website for now and it's not going to post any other prize pools until the one it has reaches that $10,000 payout.      But others will be able to build new pools right away; they will just also need to create front-ends for them at another URL.      PoolTogether Build is more like the developer tools of PoolTogether. Build will support making prize pools for any ERC-20 token that can be deposited on DeFi platforms Compound or Yearn.Finance (for now, more sources of yield to come).      Build will also support other prize strategies. So, for example, the pool could say, for example, that half of its yield goes to depositors and half to some charity. Or it could award its pool to 10 winners, rather than only one.      PoolTogether also will have new features such as referral rewards and HODLer rewards. So depositors can earn extra tickets if they recruit others into a pool or they can get extra tickets if they leave their funds in a pool over multiple cycles.      Lastly, PoolTogether is now designed to deal with liquidity mining (when deposits in a smart contract earn some kind of new token, on top of their normal yield), which is not something the team anticipated going into v2.      At its core, every PoolTogether prize pool will be two smart contracts. The first contract holds the deposits and that pool can never be changed once created, so that only depositors can withdraw the liquidity. The second smart contract collects the yield in order to distribute the prize. That smart contract can be changed by its creator, but the only thing that could ever be at risk then is the prize, not the deposits.      To deal with liquidity mining, any token sent to the wallet of the deposit smart contract will just be bounced to the corresponding prize smart contract, which should solve for any surprising new tokens that come along in the future.      PoolTogether has accumulated quite a bit of COMP over DeFi Summer. It plans to trade it all for dai that it can use to bolster returns in this first pool.    Business model    When PoolTogether first launched, it initially planned to shave off a tiny bit of the yield earned on its pools to keep the lights on.      But the team has since joined other early DeFi pioneers in turning all of its returns over to liquidity providers.

Announced Thursday, the peer-to-peer platform plans to acquire blockchain-based esports streaming service DLive.tv, which will be migrated – along with existing BitTorrent services – into a newly formed entity, BitTorrent X.      DLive was selected as part of BitTorrents' attempt to pivot its core business model into one that offers decentralized storage, data protocols and content distribution, according to a press announcement.      The esports streaming service boasts around 7 million active users and over 200,000 active content creators.      BitTorrent X's services will be powered by the platform's native BTT token, which was created shortly after the platform was acquired by Tron founder Justin Sun in 2019.

42384949,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAmM7x,1603375224,DOJ’s Crypto Framework Is ‘a Complete Disaster’ for Digital Privacy Rights,"The U.S. Department of Justice’s (DOJ) recent crypto enforcement framework is a threat to digital privacy rights, according to an attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF).      “It was a complete disaster for privacy and anonymity and civil liberties in the cryptocurrency space,” said Marta Belcher, special counsel to the digital rights advocacy group.      The framework, released earlier this month, details the U.S. government’s approach to crimes committed using cryptocurrencies, but also appears to define some broad policy positions on crypto and crypto exchanges more generally. Belcher, who is an attorney with Ropes and Gray and an outside counsel to Protocol Labs, said the framework released earlier this month raises many concerns about privacy rights, pointing to language on peer-to-peer exchanges, mixers/tumblers and “anonymity enhanced cryptocurrencies” (privacy coins).      In Belcher’s view, there are a number of legal concerns with the crypto enforcement framework as laid out by the DOJ’s Cyber Digital Task Force. Language in the framework would appear to have implications for individuals sending cryptocurrencies to one another, as well as exchangers offering transactions as a service.      The enforcement framework even had a section on mixers and tumblers, noting that entities qualifying as money services businesses are subject to the BSA or “similar international regulations.”    Encryption    The DOJ’s arguments against cryptocurrencies are similar to those made against encryption, another law enforcement boogeyman. The DOJ, alongside other members of the “Five Eyes” intelligence alliance plus India and Japan published a statement calling for backdoor access to encrypted messaging services and other systems last weekend.      The statement reflects law enforcement agencies’ “fundamental discomfort” with any technology that could allow for private interactions, said Jake Chervinsky, general counsel at Compound Finance.      The enforcement framework is ""making exactly the same argument you’ve seen being made for decades about encryption,” Belcher told CoinDesk. “These are the exact same arguments that are against encryption and they’re coming from the exact same place as the fight against encryption.”      Read more: Startup Aleo Wants to Help You Use the Internet Without Sacrificing Data Privacy      The intelligence agencies claim backdoors in encrypted protocols and systems would make it easier to identify and prosecute crimes committed using privacy-protecting tools (including cryptocurrencies).      This statement ignores the technical realities of building strong encryption, he noted.      “The Five Eyes [coalition continues] to overlook a few basic points about encryption: first, that strong encryption itself enhances public safety and prevents crime by protecting people and their data; second, that it's impossible to build backdoors into encrypted systems without creating extraordinary new cybersecurity risks; and third, that cryptography tools are increasingly open-source and can't be easily cabined or controlled at their request,” he said.      Many cryptocurrency companies and developers, for example, wouldn’t be able to comply with the backdoor requests because of this open sourcing, he said.    P2P exchangers    According to the DOJ’s crypto framework, a P2P exchanger is considered a money services business, which means it is required to abide by recordkeeping and reporting requirements as defined by the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and other regulations if they buy or sell convertible virtual currencies.      The framework defines individual exchangers as individuals who provide crypto transaction services to others, but Belcher believes it could be used to apply to two individuals who just transact between each other – not just individuals acting as service providers.      “Individual exchangers – as well as platforms and websites – that fail to collect and maintain customer or transactional data or maintain an effective AML/CFT program may be subject to civil and criminal penalties,” the framework said, referring to anti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism regulations.      The distinction is between “software providers” and “service providers,” Chervinsky said. Software providers, which compose a large part of the crypto industry, deploy decentralized protocols and publish open-source projects that the writers cannot control or modify. Service providers, on the other hand, offer “permissioned, proprietary platforms” that the operators can control.      Read more: The US Crypto Enforcement Framework Is a Warning to International Exchanges      In Belcher’s view, the crypto framework puts both individuals who write code for peer-to-peer transactions as well as those who use this code at risk for enforcement actions.      “There’s liability on people using these exchanges in order to exchange cryptocurrencies anonymously with others,” she said. “To say I can’t send you cryptocurrency using a script, you and I can’t transact with each other directly in a peer-to-peer way without that data being collected somewhere by a third party is a complete affront to privacy and civil liberty.”      Individuals can easily conduct similar transactions using cash, she said. “No one questions that I can hand you money without there needing to be a written record of that.”    Privacy protections    The framework also took aim at privacy coins and other tools to obfuscate transactions, like mixers and tumblers. Belcher said it is wrong to focus on whether privacy coins can be compliant with the BSA and other laws.      Cryptocurrencies could potentially transfer the privacy protections that come from cash transactions and shift them online, she said.      “The thing that is so important for me is that you can transact anonymously and you can take the protections of cash and you can transfer that to the online world,” she said.      “The idea that merely by exercising your right to transact anonymously is indicative of you committing a crime is wrong in my view.”      Read more: FinCEN: Stablecoin Issuers Are Money Transmitters, No Matter What      The U.S. government followed the framework with its first enforcement action against a bitcoin mixer just 11 days later, when the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) fined Larry Dean Harmon, the alleged operator of a mixer, $60 million for his operations.      However, that particular case doesn’t have major implications for mixing software more generally, said Carlton Fields attorney Andrew Hinkes on Twitter.      “The facts here are egregious and ghastly. A service provider that profits from software that provides money transmission services must comply, must keep records, and must report. Plain as day, and should be obvious by now,” he wrote, pointing to various facts in the case, including the operator’s boasting of transaction privacy for customers, transactions conducted for Iran-affiliated accounts and payments facilitated for at least one child exploitation site.      Chervinsky agreed, noting that Harmon was treated like a service provider, not a software provider.    Financial censorship    It’s possible the DOJ’s framework can help contribute to financial censorship, an ongoing issue within the U.S., Belcher said.      Traditional payments giants surveil and censor a number of transactions, including innocuous ones that might upset certain sensibilities.      “There are all these examples of a kinky bookstore or a nonprofit that supports LGBT fiction getting their accounts shut down by Visa and Mastercard, and also famously things like WikiLeaks that then turn to cryptocurrency when they can’t be served by the financial intermediaries that are censoring that,” she said.      These transactions aren’t illegal, Belcher noted.      Read more: The Web Wasn’t Built for Privacy, but It Could Be      A cashless society is effectively a surveillance society in this respect, she said.      Actual crimes committed using cryptocurrencies should be prosecuted, and it’s a benefit to the crypto community when they are, she said.      The DOJ report included dozens of examples of crimes that were committed using or at some point touching on cryptocurrencies, including several recent high-profile cases.      However, blaming cryptocurrencies for their use in crimes does not make sense, she said.      “I think they’re missing that cash has always been used to facilitate illegal activity,” she said. “We don’t blame Ford when one of its cars is used as a getaway vehicle in a bank robbery.”",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/10/22/dojs-crypto-framework-is-a-complete-disaster-for-digital-privacy-rights,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/36eaeafc0bbe46ea293d01269f1081b08b983892-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42422893,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0qoFh,1603371600,Bitcoin Hodlers Get a Lending Option With No KYC,"Hodl Hodl, a non-custodial bitcoin exchange, is launching a lending product. The exchange claims it will be “the first true bitcoin DeFi” (decentralized finance) product.  Starting this month, bitcoiners can borrow USDT, USDC, PAX or DAI stablecoins in a peer-to-peer fashion, without going through know-your-customer (KYC) procedures, leaving their bitcoin as collateral for a period ranging from one day to one year.  The launch is following a larger crypto lending boom that took off in 2018, when venture-backed companies like Genesis Capital and BlockFi came to market. Genesis boasted $1.4 billion in active loans this August and BlockFi CEO Zac Prince told CoinDesk the company had $1.75 billion worth of crypto assets under management in October.  Both firms offer fiat loans backed by cryptocurrency collateral to retail borrowers and crypto loans to institutional investors. The market still has room for newcomers, Prince believes. “I think the space overall still has tons of opportunity, and the more smart folks building things with user value creation in mind the better.”  Now, Hodl Hodl is trying to introduce “true P2P lending in bitcoin.” Hodl Hodl CEO Max Keidun told CoinDesk: “Almost all (if not all) existing lending platforms are centralized, require KYC, don’t allow you to play by your own rules.”  Keeping those keys  Unlike existing crypto lending services, Hodl Hodl’s Lend marketplace will not act as a custodian and won’t store bitcoin collateral. Instead, the borrowers will lock their bitcoins in two-out-of-three multisig escrows for the time of the loan, and get it back when they pay back the stablecoins they borrowed. To release the funds from escrow, a transaction will need to be signed by two keys.  All stablecoin transactions will happen outside of the platform, Keidun said.  There is no option to borrow or lend fiat money on Lend. The platform’s goal is “to eliminate fiat-related risks for its clients, which is impossible using a middleman such as a bank,” according to the Terms and Conditions draft shared with CoinDesk.  This approach is not widespread, nor is building DeFi products on the Bitcoin blockchain. Roderik van der Graaf, founder of Lemniscap, a venture fund that recently invested in Hodl Hodl, said it’s no surprise: “Bringing complex financial use cases to a constrained and secure ecosystem like Bitcoin's is not an easy feat – which is evidenced in the lack of projects currently offering such use cases in production.”  P2P arrangements  The lender and the borrower will agree on the amount, time period, interest rate of the loan and the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, which can be anywhere between 30% and 70%. Lend will take a 2% commission from each deal. When the two parties agree on the terms, each will get one key from the multisig, with Lend holding the third one.  That third key, held by the platform, will come into play if there is a dispute between the two parties, in which case Lend will act as an arbiter and release the funds to the party that proves itself right. Or, if the price of bitcoin goes down, the collateral value depreciates and the borrower fails to fix it, Lend will use the third key to liquidate the collateral, which is, to release it to the lender and close the loan.  The Lend team will be monitoring the price of bitcoin on exchanges like Coinbase, Huobi, Binance and Bitfinex and notify borrowers that their LTV ratio is approaching the threshold and they need to top up their collateral.  If Hodl Hodl sees the LTV in a loan is rising above 75%, the borrower will get a first alert, followed by two margin calls if they fail to add collateral or repay part of the loan to get the LTV ratio back to the agreed level.  At 90% LTV, Hodl Hodl will force liquidation of the collateral and release bitcoin to the lender, said Maria Geiko, COO of Hodl Hodl. If the bitcoin amount locked in escrow is greater than the debt, the difference will go back to the borrower.  Stefan Jespers, Belgium-based bitcoin advocate known as WhalePanda on Twitter, invested in Lend last fall and believes the project can ride the DeFi wave launched recently by the Ethereum community, but this time with bitcoin.  “If you have some stablecoins laying around that you aren't using, it's a nice way to make some extra money with it. And you know beforehand what the interest rate will be. With most other products on the market, those rates can change frequently, here it's locked for the entire duration,” Jespers said.  American turn  Unlike Hodl Hodl itself, which says it’s not serving clients from the U.S., Lend will be available globally, including to American bitcoiners, though not immediately. For the first two weeks, Keidun said, U.S. customers won’t be able to use Lend. “It’s a technical thing, we need to tweak settings on the backend,” Keidun said.  Gabriel Shapiro, partner at the Belcher, Smolen & Van Loo law firm, told CoinDesk that a multisig approach practised by Hodl Hodl is currently in the “gray area” under the existing regulation in the U.S., as the law does not currently say anything about such specific situations.  However, the fact that the platform is adjudicating disputes and determining which party the money should go to might potentially make it look like a money services business in the eyes of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), Shapiro said: “They are playing an essential role in the transmission.”  Over the past years, U.S. regulators have been coming after crypto businesses that served American users without following the rules that a mainstream financial business would follow, including obligatory KYC/AML checks and licensing procedures. The latest high-profile victim is BitMEX, a major crypto derivatives exchange.  Keidun believes that not touching fiat money or holding custody of clients’ funds puts the exchange beyond the FinCEN supervision. When asked what Hodl Hodl would do if FinCEN does not agree with this approach, Keidun said they would leave the U.S. market.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/10/22/bitcoin-hodlers-get-a-lending-option-with-no-kyc,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b52defd8bb89e339bf83109da5d37bd42362a6d4-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384956,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAmMGl,1603370875,First Mover: The FOMO Takes Over as PayPal Play Sparks Bitcoin Rally to $13K,"Bitcoin (BTC) was higher, following through on the upside after Wednesday's 7.4% jump to a new 2020 high. It was the biggest single-day increase in almost three months.      The surge past $12,000, with prices now around $13,000, came after the consumer payments giant PayPal (PYPL)announced it would allow its 346 million customers to hold bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and to use the digital assets to shop at the 26 million merchants on its network.      ""Traders are now eyeing for BTC to test the $14,000 long-term resistance from 2019, which we believe should be breached in the coming months ahead,"" Lennard Neo, head of research for the cryptocurrency-focused structured-products firm Stack Funds, wrote early Thursday in a report.      In traditional markets, European indexes slid and U.S. stock futures pointed to a lower open as lawmakers in Washington failed to agree on a new economic stimulus package as data showed a rising number of coronavirus cases.    Market Moves    The official confirmation Wednesday that PayPal is pushing into cryptocurrencies (reported months ago by CoinDesk's Ian Allison) ignited a fresh rally in prices for bitcoin, already seen as one of the world's top-performing asset classes this year.      And it might be the fear of missing out, or FOMO, that now pushes bitcoin prices even higher.      ""Big moves can trigger periods of pure FOMO,"" Matt Blom, head of sales and trading for the publicly traded cryptocurrency financial firm Diginex, wrote Thursday. ""Sophisticated traders are definitely aware of the opportunity.""      The FOMO instinct might be especially strong as the coronavirus-infected economy relegates Wall Street stock and bond traders to hoping for trillion-dollar stimulus packages just to keep asset prices from falling.      ""Markets are pretty aggressively priced,” said George Pearkes, global macro strategist at Bespoke Investment Group, told Bloomberg News.      Bitcoin appears to get uplift from new stimulus announcements, since many cryptocurrency investors see it as a hedge against inflation. But digital assets also get the benefit of the doubt as a new technology that might revolutionize the financial industry, or as a form of payment that might find adoption from Argentina to Nigeria.      “This coalescing of fintech and bitcoin is yet another bullish development for investors,” Zac Prince, CEO of the crypto lender BlockFi, told CoinDesk in an email.      With just a couple months left in 2020, the largest cryptocurrency is on track to outperform – by far – pretty much every other major traditional asset class, from stocks to bonds to gold. It would be the second year in a row that's happened.      Bitcoin prices, which doubled in 2019, are now up 80% so far this year. That compares with 6.3% for the Standard & Poor's 500 Index of large U.S. stocks and a 27% increase for gold.      PayPal's announcement, and bitcoin's ensuing rally, garnered ink from mainstream financial publications including Bloomberg News, the Financial Times and MarketWatch.      ""It's the sheer scale of PayPal's reach that is attracting the headlines,"" Jason Deane, an analyst for the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency analysis firm Quantum Economics, wrote in a report. ""This could well go down in history as a watershed moment, the point at which bitcoin goes properly mainstream.""      Such speculation might just be hype, sheer folly, a bubble mentality. Or it might be inevitable. Or all of the above.      - Bradley Keoun    Bitcoin Watch    Bitcoin's price rally looks overdone, as per technical indicators. However, these metrics often trap investors on the wrong side of the market and are unreliable.      The cryptocurrency jumped to 15-month highs above $13,200 on Wednesday after online payments giant PayPal added support for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. At press time, bitcoin is trading near $13,000, representing a 20% gain for the month.      The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is now hovering above 70, indicating overbought conditions. The RSIs on the 4-hour and hourly charts also show the price rally is overdone.      But other measures show that the latest price level might have staying power.      Data extracted from the Bitcoin blockchain show a surge in inflows to cryptocurrency exchanges, typically a sign that sellers are queuing up to sell. According to the blockchain intelligence firm Chainalysis received a total of 106,519 BTC on Wednesday, the highest daily inflow since Oct. 2.      Even so, prices are holding up, signaling there's also a strong bid from interested buyers. It's not unprecedented: A similar spike in inflows was observed Sept. 4, but the cryptocurrency rallied to 15-month highs.      All things considered, the price rally is likely to continue.      - Omkar Godbole      Read More: Above $13K: Bitcoin Unfazed by Profit Takers After Rise to 2020 High    Token watch    Zcash (ZEC): Partnership between tokenizer Tokensoft and custodian Anchorage leads to wrapped zcash (WZEC) that can be used on Ethereum blockchain and deployed in DeFi protocols.

42384951,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAmM9D,1603368040,"Forget Ethereum, DeFi Is Being Built on Bitcoin","A few weeks ago a CoinDesk headline,""Why Hardnosed Bitcoiners Can Learn to Love DeFi,"" caught my eye. The title was designed for controversy. Decentralized finance (DeFi) seems to be everything Bitcoiners reject: useless tokens created for haphazard projects and quick money-grabs driven by ponzinomics. All of this happening on Ethereum, Bitcoin's unprincipled competitor.      Yet, to dismiss the piece, and its author Matt Luongo, would be a mistake. Matt is an ardent Bitcoiner making an argument that to me seems obvious. As a long-time Bitcoiner, it has always been my dream to extend Bitcoin's decentralization to the wider economy. That is precisely what Matt is saying: It is time for us to take our belief in decentralization to the next level.    Edan Yago is a contributor to Sovryn and founder of CementDAO. Sovryn is a decentralized bitcoin trading and lending platform. CementDAO is a decentralized tool to unite the fragmented stablecoin ecosystem.    We already have a decentralized currency; now we should decentralize the services through which we use that currency. I disagree, however, with Matt's proposed solution.      The same day Matt's article came out, we learned BitMEX, where so many Bitcoiners have deposited their bitcoin, is under threat. Not only does this place users' bitcoin and private information in jeopardy, it also threatens the availability of a type of financial service that many Bitcoiners have found useful.      Over time, all BitMEX-type services will find themselves under pressure to become regulated. They will demand users dox themselves through know-your-customer (KYC) rules. They will continue to become centralized chokepoints in the Bitcoin economy where authorities can exert pressure, control and extend their tentacles of surveillance. This is not how we build an uncensorable, permissionless economy around bitcoin. We need an alternative.      If we want to extend Bitcoin's ethos of freedom and self-sovereignty beyond just hodling, then bitcoin services must become decentralized. That's what DeFi is. Bottom line, nobody should be paying more attention and be more supportive of DeFi than Bitcoiners.    There is simply no reason to build ""Bitcoin DeFi"" on Ethereum.    So where do Matt and I disagree? Matt suggests the way to accomplish that is by taking advantage of the DeFi services being built on Ethereum. To make this possible, he has been working hard on tBTC, a more decentralized way of tokenizing bitcoin on Ethereum.      Ethereum, he argues, is where the action is, it is where the DeFi services are, it is where the network effects are being built. All of this is true. However, it is also true that on Ethereum, tokenized BTC, however well decentralized the token is, will always be a second-class citizen. The base currency is ether (ETH), the transaction fees are paid in ETH, the security assurances are those of Ethereum.      For me, and I suspect for many, this is at best a major disadvantage and at worst a fatal flaw. There is simply no reason to build ""Bitcoin DeFi"" on Ethereum. Bitcoin layer 2 provides all the tools to do this in a bitcoin-native environment, with clearer security assurances, lower fees and without creating competing altcoins.      See also: DeFi Dad – Five Years In, DeFi Now Defines Ethereum      The Bitcoin-sidechain called RSK is host to a growing number of Bitcoin DeFi services that provide the core financial functions. Money-on-Chain creates a bitcoin-backed stablecoin, giving Bitcoiners access to U.S. dollar-denominated funds, without having to touch fiat. Sovryn will soon provide permissionless and uncensorable spot trading, leveraged trading, borrowing and lending.      As Matt suggests, Bitcoiners have a valuable asset and should be able to earn yield on it without going through a centralized service. That is possible today without Ethereum or any other altcoin. Bitcoin's massive pool of users and asset value is the biggest network effect in crypto. People are waking up to the fact that Bitcoin, the original DeFi, now is gaining even more decentralized superpowers.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,ALTCOIN | BTC | ETH | FIAT | TRADING,Edan Yago,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/10/22/forget-ethereum-defi-is-being-built-on-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f01f5d8a530163bd68fb4a96a4ef350e8a83e635-2400x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384955,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAmMFV,1603365568,Back at $13K: Bitcoin Unfazed by Profit Takers After Rise to 2020 High,"The bitcoin (BTC) market looks to be shrugging off increased selling pressure from profit takers after prices surged this week.    On Wednesday, bitcoin jumped over 7% to hit 15-month highs above $13,000 after payments giant PayPal (ticker: PYPL) announced support for cryptocurrencies.  Cryptocurrency exchanges tracked by blockchain intelligence firm Chainalysis received a total of 106,519 BTC on Wednesday, the highest daily inflow since Oct. 2. A similar spike was observed on Sept. 4.  That could be a concern for bulls, as flows to exchanges often precede sell-offs.  ""The pickup in exchange inflows indicates some investors rushed to liquidate their holdings (take profit) in the rising market,"" Philip Gradwell, chief economist at Chainalysis, told CoinDesk over WhatsApp.  However, there's reason to believe that any higher levels of sales were absorbed Wednesday, as bitcoin's trade intensity (a measure of how many times an inflowing coin is traded) jumped to a two-month high of 5.8. That's more than double the 90-day average.  Each of the 106,519 bitcoins sent to exchanges yesterday was traded on average 5.8 times, meaning the market had capacity to absorb the sales.  ""While people are taking advantage of high prices, they are being outweighed by buyers,"" Gradwell said.  As such, the ongoing price rally looks to have legs. Bitcoin is currently trading around $13,020, having witnessed a pullback from $13,230 in the past 12 hours, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  So far today, about 30,000 BTC have been transferred to exchanges, Gradwell noted.  Going forward, there's likely to be no shortage of buyers amid the optimism generated by PayPal's move into crypto services and increasing institutional participation.  ""2020 is fast becoming the year of crypto acceptance and we see 2021 as the year of mainstream adoption,"" Constantin Kogan, managing director at Wave Financial Group, told CoinDesk in an email.  Bitcoin will maintain ""a strong bullish trend and rise beyond $14,000 by the year's end,"" he said.

These can include musical scores, videos, images, articles and essays.

The initiative will see the bank's RBI Coin integrated with the Pantos blockchain interoperability tool from Vienna-based cryptocurrency exchange Bitpanda, according to a press release on Thursday.  Unveiled in May, RBI Coin is a tokenized version of national currency, often called stablecoins, aimed to facilitate more reliable and near-instant payments between banks and businesses.  Currently a pilot project, the bank partnered with Polish-British fintech firm Billon to use its distributed ledger technology for the e-money solution.  Bitpanda said Pantos comes as the result of over 2.5 years research with the ​Technical University of Vienna, and is designed to allow token projects to avoid being restricted to any one blockchain.  Raiffeisen will deploy the tech as a proof-of-concept trial initially, allowing the banking industry to become ""technology-agnostic in the field of fast-changing blockchain technologies,"" according to the announcement.  ""The Pantos technology plays an integral role in making the tokenization of assets a reality within our banking group by bringing in the interoperability aspect thus allowing for even more extensive and flexible use cases for banking customers,” said Christian Wolf, head of Strategic Partnerships & Ecosystems at Raiffeisen Bank International.

42384943,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAmLz9,1603346400,Voyager Agrees to Buy LGO Markets and Merge 2 Firms' Tokens,"Two cryptocurrency trading firms are merging and, in a rare twist, so are their tokens.      Voyager Digital, a publicly traded digital asset brokerage with offices in New York, has agreed to buy LGO, a French crypto exchange primarily serving institutional investors, as Voyager expands to Europe.      The transaction requires regulatory approval, which the parties said they expect to receive by the end of this year along with the token swap. The value of the deal will depend on the value of Voyager's shares and the firms' tokens, at closing. At current prices it would be in the low seven figures.      As such, this deal is dwarfed by this year's blockbuster crypto M&A deals such as Binance's acquisition of CoinMarketCap, estimated to be worth $400 million, and FTX's $150 million deal to acquire Blockfolio.      Read More: ‘They Have the Users’: Binance CEO Explains Why He Bought CoinMarketCap      What makes this deal unusual is the two companies' utility tokens, VGX and LGO, will be swapped into newly minted tokens featuring decentralized finance (DeFi) functions such as community governance and staking at an initial interest rate of 7%.      “We think this is really taking the old-school mergers and acquisitions to the token world, which hasn't been done before,” Steve Ehrlich, Voyager's co-founder and chief executive officer, told CoinDesk.      Upon completion, Voyager, which is publicly listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange, will issue one million shares for the acquisition and operate in the European retail market with LGO’s Virtual Asset Service Provider registration with the French Financial Markets regulator (AMF). All activities will be conducted under the Voyager brand and LGO will discontinue its institutional services on Oct. 31. Shares of Voyager closed at C$0.67 (US$0.51) on Wednesday.      Read More: Voyager to Pay Interest on DeFi Tokens to Gain Brokerage Clients      Hugo Renaudin, co-founder and chief executive officer of LGO, told CoinDesk the French company made the deal after it decided to shift its focus from institutional clients to increasing value for its token holders.      “The key decision maker is what will bring the most value to our tokens,” Renaudin said. “So we have this token. We have token holders and they’re mostly retail"" clients.    LGO launched an initial coin offering (ICO) in February 2018, according to its website, which raised 3,600 bitcoin (worth about $36 million at the time). The company’s white paperhttps://storage.googleapis.com/lgo-public-documents/LGO-WhitePaper-V1. shows that 60% of the tokens were distributed through a pre-sale process, while 20% of the supply went to LGO's founders and advisers.    At its peak in April 2018, the LGO token’s market cap was nearly $40 million, according to data from CoinMarketCap. On Wednesday, that value was calculated to be $1.5 million.      Renaudin told CoinDesk the company’s other option would have been focusing on better serving its institutional clients, which means its spot exchange would have to provide new and exotic derivatives products. After consideration, he said the team had decided to change its focus to retail customers instead.      The merger comes during a time of regulatory crackdown on crypto derivatives trading around the globe. Popular crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX was charged by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) with facilitating unregistered trading activities, while in the U.K., the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has banned crypto derivatives for retail consumers.      This is not the first acquisition by Voyager, which went public in early 2019 in a reverse merger with the shell of a Canadian mineral exploration company. Previously, it acquired wallet startup Ethos.io for about $4 million.
