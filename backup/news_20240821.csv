32696037,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=636963,1724283022,Polygon (MATIC) Breakout Could Propel Price To $1 In Days: Crypto Analyst,"Polygon (MATIC) stands as one of the top performers in today’s crypto market, ranking third among the top-100 cryptocurrencies by market cap as of August 21. With a gain of 9% within the last 24 hours, the MATIC price recent surge is outpaced only by the Justin Sun associated crypto assets, TRON (+12%) and BitTorrent (+22%). Over the past week, MATIC has experienced a notable rally, accumulating over a 23% increase in its value. This upswing has positioned MATIC at a crucial juncture from a technical analysis standpoint. Crypto analyst World of Charts (@WorldOfCharts1) has pointed out via an analysis on X that Polygon has broken out of a more than six-month long downtrend. The analyst predicts that MATIC could potentially surge towards the $1 mark. Polygon (MATIC) Poised For 143% Rally? The Polygon price has been caught in a descending channel since mid-March, identified by two parallel downward-sloping trend lines. This channel represents a consolidation pattern typically observed as the price makes lower highs and lower lows. Historically, a descending channel is bearish in the context of a downtrend but can indicate a reversal if a breakout occurs. Related Reading: MATIC Price (Polygon) Sets Sights Higher: Can It Gain Bullish Momentum? Yesterday, on August 20, the Polygon price broke out from this descending channel, which can be considered a major bullish signal, suggesting a potential end to the previous downtrend. The breakout move by MATIC is crucial because it not only represents a shift in market sentiment but also sets a new trajectory for potential price targets. The breakout point is situated at approximately $0.44. Following the breakout, the price is projected to rise by more than 143%, according to the analyst. A price rally of this magnitude would push the MATIC price above $1.10. “Matic testing crucial area breakout can lead massive recovery towards 1$ in coming days,” World of Charts remarked via X. Critically, the current price level, post-breakout, needs to serve as a new support level. If MATIC maintains above the descending trend line and ideally performs a successful retest, the bullish outlook could be confirmed. Should the price drop below the trend line again, it might be considered a false breakout, potentially leading to a reassessment of the bullish scenario. Related Reading: MATIC Set For Rebranding In Early September: Will Polygon Prices Recover After Sinking 65%? Furthermore, investors might want to monitor the trading volume and market sentiment. Both will probably play critical roles in sustaining the current upward momentum. An increase in trading volume typically accompanies genuine breakouts, providing further confirmation. A catalyst for another Polygon Rally is just around the corner. As announced in mid-July, Polygon will complete the migration from MATIC to POL on September 4. POL is an eagerly awaited upgrade, primarily due to its role in enhancing the functionality of Polygon’s native token. Upon its implementation, POL will serve immediate practical purposes within the existing Polygon Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network. It will become the principal gas and staking token of Polygon PoS, playing a crucial role in the security framework of the Polygon network. At press time, MATIC traded at $0.4775.

42417383,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYH1R,1724281231,Top Republican Retains Hope U.S. Crypto Legislation Can Get Done This Year,"TETON VILLAGE, WY. — The window for crypto legislation in 2024 is narrowing, but there is still a path toward getting something passed this year, Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) said Wednesday.  While neither she nor Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), who also spoke at the SALT Wyoming Symposium hosted ahead of the Federal Reserve's annual Jackson Hole meeting, delved into the specifics of any particular bill, she referenced work in the Senate Agriculture Committee.  Lummis and Scott also appealed to voters during the brief SALT appearance, saying Republicans are more aligned with crypto interests than Democrats. (Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has loudly endorsed crypto this election cycle. While Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate, hasn't directly addressed the issue, Bloomberg on Wednesday reported that she's signaled a friendlier stance toward digital assets.)  Scott, the lead Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, has not said much about crypto during his tenure as the committee's ranking member. However, he introduced himself to crypto crowds with Lummis at the BTC Nashville conference last month, where he echoed popular talking points in the crypto community, including calling for more lenient regulators and saying he'd support crypto-friendly legislation.  If control of the Senate flips to Republicans, Scott will become the chair. On Wednesday, he floated the possibility of creating a subcommittee focused on digital assets if he takes on that role.  ""Wouldn't it be cool if we had a subcommittee on the Banking Committee that focuses on the industry, so that we bring more light to the conversation, more hearings on the industry, so that we get things done faster,"" he said. ""We go further, faster in a shorter period of time, because we have the kind of motivation and momentum that leads to having bills on the floor marked up.""  Both Lummis and Scott referred to current committee Chair Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) as lawmakers who were creating ""headwinds"" in their pursuit of crypto legislation.  ""The only way we're going to get anything done this year is if it comes through the Senate Agriculture Committee in the form of Commodity Futures Trading Commission [legislation],"" Lummis said. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), the Senate Majority Leader, vowed to move crypto legislation through the Senate and have it signed into law by the end of the year during an appearance at a ""Crypto4Harris"" event last week.  She described a hypothetical scenario in which the Senate Agriculture Committee could vote a bill out of committee, and it would become ""a Christmas tree, as we call it.""  In this scenario, Lummis said she could see stablecoin provisions tacked on to the Agriculture Committee bill, using the Howey Test as a base for helping define stablecoins.  ""Chuck Schumer gets to have his SAFER Banking bill, and all of a sudden you come up with a very broad financial services bill, and then it's got enough flow to pass,"" Lummis said. ""And so that's a scenario that actually could play out after the election. The challenge is going to be having enough legislative days to pull something like that off.""  Scott concurred, saying it was unlikely that any bill could work through the Senate Banking Committee this year.  ""The motivation and the incentives are there. Two pieces of the incentives that are really important, [House Financial Services Committee Patrick] McHenry [in] financial services, [Senate Agriculture Committee Chair Debbie] Stabenow [are both retiring members,"" he said. ""Schumer wants to give Stabenow a swan song, which could be this legislation. So you have the forces on both sides of the aisle in a bicameral way, working to get something done so that their legacy includes legislation that will be incredibly beneficial, not only to the industry, but in my opinion, to the American consumer.""  Election considerations  Scott predicted that there is a good chance for Republicans to hold 52 or 53 seats in the 100-member U.S. Senate after the 2024 election, noting that West Virginia's Joe Manchin (I-W.V.) was not running for reelection and pointing to close races in Ohio and Montana.  ""It's not about being better politically. It's really about self-interest. Americans vote on typically popular issues, and then community issues,"" Scott said, pointing to former President Trump's comments at BTC Nashville as a focus on these issues.  Lummis took a shot at Vice President Harris during the panel, saying ""there is no indication"" that she would be ""good to this industry.""  Harris' campaign has yet to present any crypto-specific plans, only beginning to roll out policy initiatives last week. Earlier on Wednesday, Harris campaign adviser Brian Nelson, a former senior Treasury official, said Harris wants to grow the crypto industry, without delving into specifics.  Lummis said this is a stark contrast to the Republican party platform, saying Trump had written a platform pitch that did include digital assets.  The 2024 election is the friendliest one for Republicans over the next six years, Lummis said, referring to the number of seats up for grabs in red-leaning states. Republicans will be more on defense than Democrats in the next two elections (2026 and 2028), she said.  ""So the best math for Republicans is this one. If we had a Republican president, Republican House and Senate for two years, we can move mountains. We could be significant. We can take the lead in this industry and others and move the needle in a positive direction that fosters innovation,"" she said. ""If we miss this opportunity, we don't have the same opportunity for a long time.""",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | COMMODITY | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/08/21/top-republican-retains-hope-us-crypto-legislation-can-get-done-this-year,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4c34fd37d41afa72d01b5b6c7f4a22a2ed4a9aa0-5151x2897.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

32695159,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637079,1724281222,"Solana-Based Memecoin Rug Pulled By McDonald’s Hacker, Market Cap Plummets 98%","The crypto ecosystem has seen a surge in memecoins and their popularity over the past year. Still, the craze has ushered in a wave of scams and rug pulls targeting unsuspecting investors. The latest victim of this trend is the Solana-based GRIMACE coin, which was the subject of a rug pull. GRIMACE Surges 400% After McDonald’s Instagram Hack The incident began when hackers accessed the official McDonald’s Instagram account and used the platform to promote the GRIMACE token. The hackers spread misinformation, falsely claiming that McDonald’s had issued the GRIMACE memecoin on the Solana blockchain. Related Reading: Here’s What’s Going On With The Shiba Inu Price This had the desired effect, as investors rapidly piled into the GRIMACE token, driving its market capitalization from a modest $500,000 to a substantial $25 million in 30 minutes. At its peak, the token’s price skyrocketed by nearly 400%, reaching $0.02500 from an initial value of just $0.0005110. However, the euphoria was short-lived. After the token’s rise, the anonymous developers behind GRIMACE executed a classic rug pull, abruptly abandoning the project and absconding with over $700,000 in investor funds. The hackers even posted a message on the McDonald’s Instagram bio, brazenly stating, “Thank you for the $700,000 in Solana.” Solana Price Analysis On the other hand, the Solana price has been relatively stable since Monday, trading within a newly formed range between $138 and $142 after recovering from the drop at the beginning of the month toward the $109 level, which was the lowest point since March this year. Over the past 24 hours, SOL has recorded almost no changes compared to Tuesday’s price, experiencing a slight 0.9% drop despite Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) surging nearly 3% and 2%, respectively. This lack of price movement suggests little demand for the fifth-largest cryptocurrency in the market over the past week, further evidenced by a 14% drop in trading volume to $2.2 million in the last 48 hours, according to CoinGecko data. Related Reading: Tron Rises 24% Amid New Developments – Will The Uptrend Continue? The consolidation in Solana’s price is also concerning for bullish investors, as the token has failed to overcome its key technical indicators. Currently trading at $142, SOL has not breached its 50-day and 200-day exponential moving averages (EMAs), which are positioned at $143 and $151, respectively. Overcoming these levels would be crucial for sustained price recovery and provide important support floors in the event of potential corrections. However, it is worth noting that after the broader cryptocurrency market crash on August 5, SOL found significant support at the $129 level, representing a critical near-term defense for Solana’s price action.

42417374,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYGuD,1724278421,"Nearly Half of All Corporate Election Spending in 2024 Cycle Comes from Crypto Companies, Study Finds","Nearly half of all corporate political contributions in the 2024 election cycle came from cryptocurrency companies, according to a Wednesday report from corporate influence watchdog Public Citizen.  Public Citizen’s report, which was based on data provided by government transparency group OpenSecrets, found that, so far, 48% of corporate election spending has come from crypto companies like Ripple and Coinbase. That’s $119 million out of a total of $248 million.  The vast majority of those donations have been funneled into pro-crypto super political action committees (PACs) like Fairshake, a non-partisan super PAC focused on getting crypto-friendly candidates on both sides of the aisle elected – as well as squashing the bids of crypto skeptics.  According to Public Citizen’s report, $107.9 million of the $203 million raised by Fairshake has come directly from crypto companies, the rest from large donations made by deep-pocketed and prominent individuals in the tech and crypto industries including the Winklevoss twins and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong.  The author of Public Citizen’s report, research director Rick Claypool, described the crypto industry’s political spending as “unprecedented.” Crypto companies’ direct spending in the past three election cycles totals $129 million, or 15% of all known corporate contributions since 2010, the year that the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission that corporations have a First Amendment right to make unlimited donations to candidates via PACs.

32693322,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=636941,1724277637,Is A Bitcoin (BTC) Negative Correlation With Stocks A Bullish Signal? Analyst Reveals,"Bitcoin (BTC) and U.S. stocks have shown a negative correlation lately, with Bitcoin often moving in the opposite direction of traditional markets. This divergence has caught the attention of analysts and investors, especially as the cryptocurrency enters a period of consolidation along with the broader crypto market. Historically, shifts in this correlation—from negative to positive—have often signaled a bullish trend for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Battleground At $60,000: Bitcoin Faces Pivotal Test As Bulls Aim To Reclaim Key Support As both markets face challenges, the changing dynamics between BTC and U.S. stocks could provide crucial insights into where the market is headed. Investors are closely watching this relationship, anticipating that a shift could indicate a potential breakout for Bitcoin. Bitcoin Data Suggests Potential Uptrend The negative correlation between Bitcoin (BTC) and the U.S. stock market, particularly the S&P 500 (SPX), has become increasingly evident. Prominent analyst and trader Daan on X recently highlighted this phenomenon by overlaying the BTC/USDT futures chart with SPX prices. His analysis shows that while traditional markets like the SPX have experienced a swift recovery, Bitcoin has not followed suit. This divergence underscores the decoupling between these two markets, with Bitcoin lagging behind the broader stock recovery. Another key analyst, Caleb Franzen, brought attention to this trend, sharing data revealing Bitcoin’s negative correlation with major stock indices. Specifically, Franzen points out that the 90-day correlation between Bitcoin and the Nasdaq-100 ($QQQ) currently stands at -27%. This negative correlation suggests that as tech stocks recover, Bitcoin has been moving in the opposite direction, which can signify unique market dynamics. While periods of negative correlation between Bitcoin and stocks are not inherently bullish, historical evidence suggests that positive market shifts often follow such phases. The critical point for investors is to monitor a potential reversal of this correlation—when Bitcoin begins to move in tandem with the Nasdaq-100 ($QQQ) once again. If Bitcoin’s correlation with tech stocks turns positive, it could signal a strengthening market and a possible uptrend for BTC. This shift could provide a key indicator for timing potential entry points in the market. BTC Price Trading Below A Key Indicator Bitcoin trades at $59,350, below the critical daily 200-day moving average (MA) at $62,915. This moving average is a key indicator many analysts use to gauge market trends. When BTC’s price is below the daily 200 MA, it typically suggests a downtrend or a significant correction. Conversely, trading above this level indicates market strength and bullish momentum. For Bitcoin to confirm the continuation of its bull market, it needs to reclaim the daily 200 MA and consistently close above it. This would signal a potential shift in trend, providing confidence to traders and investors that the bullish phase is still intact. Currently, BTC is hovering around the key psychological level of $60,000, and the market remains in a consolidation phase after enduring months of uncertainty and volatility. For the bullish scenario to unfold, Bitcoin must break above $63,000, retaking the daily 200 MA and surpassing the August 8th local high of $62,729. This would mark a significant recovery and indicate that the market is regaining its strength.

The coming days will be crucial in determining whether Bitcoin can regain its upward momentum or if more bearish pressure lies ahead.

She referenced the cryptocurrency's transaction volume, which in 2023 was twice as high as that of Mastercard and Visa combined.  Johnson spoke at the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium in Jackson Hole on Tuesday.  JACKSON HOLE, WYOMING — Franklin Templeton CEO Jenny Johnson, who steered the asset management giant toward the digital asset space after taking over her family's company in 2020, is shocked by how much traditional financial firms are unaware of Bitcoin's scale.  In a conversation at the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium in Jackson Hole on Tuesday, Johnson said 30% of her day-to-day work is spent looking at disruptive technology, as her main focus is positioning the firm for the next generation.  This includes digital assets, which Johnson believes is one of two big, obvious trends that she didn't want to miss. (The other is artificial intelligence.)  ""What's crazy to me is that in traditional finance, they have no idea about the amount of money and the volume [of bitcoin],"" Johnson said.  In 2023, the Bitcoin {{BTC}} blockchain processed over $36.6 trillion in transactions as the market recovered from a tough year. This is in contrast to Mastercard and Visa, the two big payment networks worldwide, which processed $9 trillion and $14.8 trillion, respectively.  ""There's an entire ecosystem that almost ignores what is a parallel, massive ecosystem,"" Johnson said.  Mastercard and Visa aren't ignoring blockchain technology. Both companies have made efforts in recent years to add crypto payments to their networks. Visa in particular has run trial after trial to test out new product offerings and has partnered with several crypto-native firms, including Circle and Solana, to grow a stronger footing in the space. Mastercard is rolling out a blockchain-based debit card.  Franklin Templeton, after the appointment of Johnson as the company's CEO, quickly became a leader among traditional financial asset managers. Its OnChain U.S. Government Money Market Fund (FOBXX) became the first fund to use a public blockchain to record transactions and ownership in 2021.  Earlier this week, the company filed a proposal with the Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a fresh exchange-traded fund, trading under the ticker symbol EZPZ, that would expose investors to a range of digital assets.

32690692,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=636937,1724272252,"Glassnode Report Reveals Why The Bitcoin Price Dropped Below $50,000","Bitcoin crashed below $50,000 on August 5 in a sudden dip that saw many positions liquidated in the crypto market. This sudden dip, which cascaded into other cryptocurrencies, took the market by surprise. As such, Bitcoin fell to its lowest price in six months, and many other altcoins followed suit. Although Bitcoin has since recovered by 20% and now finds itself trading around just below $60,000, many short-term holders are still sitting in unrealized losses. A recent report from Glassnode, a leading blockchain analysis firm, sheds light on the factors contributing to this abrupt market downturn. The report suggests that the crash was largely driven by an overreaction from short-term holders, who were quick to liquidate their positions in the face of the initial decline. Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Quick To Capitulate Short-term holders are typically defined as those investors who hold onto their cryptocurrency assets for a relatively brief period, often around a month or so. As such, they are quickly prone to capitulating during periods of price corrections. This trend has particularly been evident in the latest Bitcoin price correction/consolidation, which has lasted far longer than many investors expected. Related Reading: Dogecoin Faces Supply Squeeze: What This Means For Price According to Glassnode’s most recent on-chain report, a key metric known as the STH-MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) ratio has fallen below the critical equilibrium value of 1.0. When the STH-MVRV ratio dips below 1.0, it suggests that, on average, new investors are holding their Bitcoin at a loss rather than a profit. These unrealized losses, often referred to as paper losses, occur when the market value of an asset is lower than the price at which it was acquired, but the asset has not yet been sold. This is different from realized losses, which arise from completed trades. While periods of brief unrealized loss are common during bull markets, they tend to put selling pressure on the price of Bitcoin. This is because sustained periods of STH-MVRV trading below 1.0 often lead to a higher likelihood of panic and capitulation among short-term holders. Notably, this phenomenon contributed to the Bitcoin crash earlier in the month. Related Reading: Cardano Kicked Out Of Top 10 Crypto By Market Cap, What’s Going On? Furthermore, Glassnode’s report reveals this correlation and selling pressure might already be taking place, with the STH-SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) also trading below 1.0. The STH-SOPR ratio measures the profitability of spent outputs, indicating whether assets are being sold at a profit or loss. What this essentially means is that many short-term investors are more taking realized losses than profit. This follows the claim that many short-term holders have been overreacting to the price corrections. While short-term holders have carried most of the losses across the recent downturn, long-term holders remain strong. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $59,540 and is down by 2.15% in the past 24 hours.

42417372,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYGq5,1724272017,'Get Him Home': Binance CEO Urges Nigerian Government to Free Detained Exec,"Binance CEO Richard Teng urged Nigeria to release detained American executive Tigran Gambaryan.  ""He needs medical treatment before his conditions become permanent,"" Teng said during an interview. ""Our priority is really to get him home safely.""  NEW YORK — Binance CEO Richard Teng urged the Nigerian government to release Tigran Gambaryan, an American employee of the world's largest crypto exchange who has been detained in Nigeria since February.  ""Tigran has been unjustly held for close to half a year now,"" Teng told CoinDesk during a Wednesday interview in New York. ""He needs medical treatment before his conditions become permanent.""  Gambaryan, Binance's head of financial crime compliance, was detained in Abuja six months ago, shortly after voluntarily traveling to Nigeria's capital city at the government's invitation. At first, Gambaryan and another executive, British-Kenyan national Nadeem Anjarwalla, were held under house arrest without explanation.  But after Anjarwalla, Binance's regional manager for Africa, escaped custody, Gambaryan was moved to the notorious Kuje prison and charged with money laundering and tax evasion. The BBC reported in March that the Nigerian government requested nearly $10 billion from Binance to secure his release. Nigerian officials have also accused Binance, without evidence, of tanking the value of the naira.  Read more: New Binance CEO Sees No Need for IPO as He Plots 100-Year Strategy for Crypto Exchange  The tax evasion charges against Gambaryan were later dropped, but he is currently being prosecuted for money laundering in a trial that began in June. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.  Since his arrest, Gambaryan's health has rapidly deteriorated. He is believed to have contracted malaria, which, without receiving proper medical treatment, has led to subsequent infections including double pneumonia and a tonsil infection. According to a spokesperson for his family, Gambaryan has also developed complications from a herniated disc in his back, which has left him in excruciating pain and unable to walk. He has appeared in court in a wheelchair and has collapsed at least once.  Reports from Gambaryan's family suggest he has not only been denied adequate medical treatment, but also that Kuje prison authorities refuse to release his medical records despite court orders to do so. Gambaryan has also reportedly been denied sufficient access to his lawyers.  ""Our priority is really to get him home safely to his family and to his friends,"" Teng said.  Teng stressed that Binance has been committed to resolving its issues with regulators around the world, most recently in India and Brazil.  ""We have been working collaboratively with global regulators around the world to resolve issues,"" Teng said. ""We would look forward to collaborating with the Nigerian government. They don't need to hold Tigran.""  Gambaryan's unjust detention has attracted the attention of many in the crypto industry, as well as former federal prosecutors and current members of Congress who have called on U.S. President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger D. Carstens to treat Gambaryan's case as a hostage situation and bring him back to the U.S.  The U.S. government has made no public statement on Gambaryan's situation.

CZ, who is currently serving a four-month prison sentence, is no longer involved with running the company, Teng said, though CZ's partner, Ye Hi, is.  Teng noted the need to atone. ""We acknowledge our past mistakes. We have paid a heavy penalty on that front.""  NEW YORK — Richard Teng ascended to the top of cryptocurrency behemoth Binance last year via less-than-ideal circumstances as his predecessor, Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, was forced to quit the exchange as part of a multi-billion-dollar settlement with the U.S. government.  But on the plus side, he inherited a CEO job at a profitable cornerstone of the crypto industry – albeit one he aims to grow and mature.  In the nine months since he's taken the helm, Teng – a former regulator in both his native Singapore and the United Arab Emirates – has focused on transforming Binance from a founder-led organization, as it was during CZ's tenure as CEO, to one steered by a board of directors. And, while the company kept mum on where exactly it was headquartered – at least once vaguely insisting that it's an ""international company,"" and always denying that it was a Chinese company – Teng is on the hunt for a place for Binance to permanently call home.  Read more: 'Get Him Home': Binance CEO Urges Nigerian Government to Free Detained Exec  The enormous surge in crypto prices since Binance rival FTX's collapse in late 2022, coupled with traditional financial institutions' embrace of (or incursion into, depending on one's perspective) the space and hopes that U.S. regulators might soften their stance on crypto, has led to speculation about a looming wave of initial public offerings.  But, in a wide-ranging interview with CoinDesk journalists in New York on Wednesday, Teng said his seven-year-old company isn't considering one.  ""We are in very strong financial shape, so there's really no need for us to consider any fundraising or an IPO at this time,"" Teng said. ""Since the fifth month of Binance's operation, it has been profitable, and it has been very prudent in terms of spending. So [an IPO] is not a subject that has come up.""  The exchange's efforts to become more transparent – including spending 36% more on compliance efforts last year versus 2022 and its ongoing search for a place to put down roots – are, Teng says, about having better relationships with global regulators and, thus, steering the company in more future-proofed direction.  ""It's really about building a sustainable enterprise that will not only succeed over the next few years, but continue to prosper for the next 50 to 100 years,"" Teng said. ""That's certainly our aspiration.""  CZ's involvement  Teng was appointed CEO by CZ, who stepped down as Binance CEO as part of the company's $4.3 billion settlement with U.S. regulators for violating sanctions and anti-money laundering (AML) laws. CZ also pleaded guilty to failing to maintain an appropriate AML and know-your-customer (KYC) regime and was sentenced to four months in federal prison in June.  But CZ, who had been the very public face of Binance, is no longer part of the company's day-to-day operations or decision-making. (He began a four-month prison sentence in June.)  ""As part of the U.S. resolution, CZ is not able to be involved in the operations of the company,"" Teng said. ""I don't speak to him.""  However, Teng said that Binance co-founder Yi He – CZ's partner and the mother of his three youngest children – is still a ""critical part"" of the crypto exchange's management team.  ""Yi is involved in various aspects of the business,"" Teng said, adding that she oversees Binance's human resources department and likes to joke that she is the exchange's chief customer service officer. ""She's a highly talented, highly independent-minded person.""  Global ambitions  When asked whether Binance had considered raising money to potentially dilute CZ's ownership of the company, Teng demurred, saying that such questions were for the exchange's shareholders and board of directors to decide.  But Teng said that CZ's status as a felon has presented less of a challenge to getting regulated than outside observers might think.  ""We do work closely with global regulators. In many places around the world, it's not a problem. There could be areas where it may be a challenge, but we have already resolved some of those issues,"" Teng said, referring to the licenses the company has recently received and settlements it has made in countries like Dubai, India, Thailand and Brazil.  Teng stressed the importance of Binance clearing the slate with global regulators, atoning for its past missteps and moving forward with its business in a more transparent, regulated manner.  ""We acknowledge our past mistakes. We have paid a heavy penalty on that front,"" Teng said. ""Going forward, we are looking at how we continue to build a sustainable, robust platform working with global regulators.""  No interest in the U.S.  One country Binance is not currently interested in expanding into is the U.S., which levied that massive penalty on the exchange late last year.  ""At this point in time, what we're really focusing on is markets outside of the U.S.,"" Teng said.  And while many in the crypto industry are eagerly anticipating the outcome of the upcoming U.S. presidential election, hopeful that a Donald Trump victory could pave the way for a clearer – and friendlier – regulatory regime for crypto, Teng said the election results mean little to Binance either way.  ""Our business is outside of the U.S.,"" Teng said. ""So we watch with excitement what's happening in the U.S., but it has no bearing on our business whatsoever.""

42417387,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYH4X,1724270412,The Protocol: Now Everyone's Putting a Wrapper on Bitcoin,"Tron founder Justin Sun – described on a recent podcast episode as ""shameless"" but ""very shrewd"" and ""one of the smartest on-chain users, period"" – is in the headlines this week, and not just because of the new self-referentially named memecoin launchpad, SunPump. His move to take a role alongside BitGo in the custody of the $9 billion-plus wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) project has made waves in the highly competitive arena of tokenizing bitcoin for use in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols on Ethereum and other chains. Read on.  PLUS:  Urbit's in upheaval, as founder Curtis Yarvin returns, Josh Lehman departs.

Dark pools on Ethereum – are they taking over?  This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Network news  The supply of wrapped bitcoin (orange) has fluctuated, as has the market capitalization, since the price of the WBTC token trades in sync with notoriously volatile bitcoin (Dune Analytics)  WRAPPERS DELIGHT: A shakeup is afoot in the business of tokenizing bitcoin for use on the Ethereum blockchain.  Back in 2019, the crypto custodian BitGo and two partner firms conceived of ""wrapped bitcoin"" – a way of locking up bitcoin and minting an equivalent token, WBTC, that could be used on Ethereum, a crucial destination for many crypto traders since it's home to the biggest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. The WBTC project saw rapid uptake, its market capitalization surging by late 2021 to about $16 billion, before eventually settling back to the current level around $9 billion, still a top-20 cryptocurrency. Of note, however, was that BitGo served as the sole custodian for the locked-up bitcoin, seen as a potential risk.  So it would seem that BitGo's plan, announced last week, to transition WBTC to ""multi-jurisdictional custody"" – adding operations in Hong Kong and Singapore – might help to address some of the concerns. Instead, some projects and commentators have homed in on the involvement of Tron founder Justin Sun in BiT Global, the custody firm that will now oversee the locked-up bitcoin, as a new risk. ""The partnership has raised eyebrows among industry observers,"" Nydig research head Greg Cipolaro wrote on Aug. 16.  In a tweet, Sun acknowledged he had ""heard that the community has some concerns about my involvement in various projects, including WBTC,"" but insisted that his ""personal involvement in WBTC is entirely strategic. I do not control the private keys to the WBTC reserves and cannot move any BTC reserves."" BitGo CEO Mike Belshe joined an X Spaces to point out that ""there is no single party that has the ability to mint or steal from the underlying treasury.""  Even so, the decentralized stablecoin issuer MakerDAO, after a spicy online discussion on its forum, passed a motion on Aug.14 to eliminate its exposure to WBTC, due to concerns that the new setup would ""centralize too much control with BiT Global,"" as reported by CoinDesk's Sam Reynolds. For now, the DeFi protocol Aave is sticking with WBTC, according to the analysis firm CoinMetrics, but ""this transition has brought custodial and operational risks to the forefront, spurring increased interest in permissionless alternatives.""  Those might include Threshold's tBTC, or another one called dlcBTC – both out in full force on the podcast circuit over the past week. The U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase teased a new ""cbBTC."" On X, crypto influencers touted FBTC, another wrapped bitcoin alternative that launched last month with the support of Mantle Network, as a possible solution to WBTC's ""centralization risks."" Such players are ""accelerating the development for alternative (and decentralized?) versions of wrapped bitcoin,"" Galaxy Digital's Gabe Parker wrote in a newsletter. Or as Gauntlet's Tarun Chitra put it on the Chopping Block podcast, ""There's going to be this mad rush to try to fill the gap.""  A broader and perhaps more bankable take came from Presto Research: ""Regardless of one’s view on Sun’s involvement, the attempt to decentralize a key piece of the DeFi infrastructure is likely a step in the right direction, despite its challenges.""

He holds no formal title but is taking the lead on strategy.  The board of the Urbit Foundation, the nonprofit that steers core development, fired executive director Josh Lehman. Christopher Colby is filling the role on an interim basis while the board seeks a permanent replacement.  The foundation is running out of money. A fundraising proposal backed by Lehman to create a new layer-2 blockchain on top of Ethereum has been scrapped in favor of Yarvin's strategy, which involves creating a utility token, possibly on Base, Coinbase's layer-2 network.

(Blocknative)  A growing number of sophisticated Ethereum users are choosing to transact privately on the blockchain – relying on so-called dark pools to avoid trading bots set up to front-run transactions, but potentially sacrificing the openness and transparency that are supposed to be hallmarks of decentralized public networks.  That's according to new research compiled by Blocknative, a company that specializes in preventing or minimizing the impact of MEV, which stands for ""maximal extractable value"" – the profits that can be siphoned off by fast-moving software bots that can quickly enter into trades to skim margin off of transactions that are sitting in the network's public queue, waiting to be processed.  Private transactions, which are sent directly to validators or block proposers, instead of public mempools, now account for about half of the total on Ethereum, in terms of the total gas usage – reflecting the computational power required to process transactions. The percentage was about 7% in September 2022 when Ethereum transitioned into a proof-of-stake network, but it's taken off this year, jumping from about 15% since the start of 2024.  ""You have a small number of actors who can see the private flow,"" Blocknative CEO Matt Cutler said in an interview. ""Certain people can see stuff, and certain people can't, and that creates opportunity and advantage.""  Click here for the full article by Bradley Keoun  Calendar  Aug. 28-29: WebX, Tokyo.

42417375,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYGr7,1724269819,If Men Were Angels: Decentralization’s Silent Comeback,"James Madison famously wrote in Federalist No. 51 that “if men were angels, no government would be necessary.” The remedy entailed structuring a government that doesn’t merely control the governed, but also controls itself. This idea of checks and balances was etched into America’s DNA from its inception. The country was born into a system that was, by design, decentralized.  As the nation evolved, so did the press. What we now call the mainstream media became what some label the “Fourth Estate” - an independent entity that provides essential oversight to centralized power. And more recently there emerged a de facto “Fifth Estate,” with the rise of citizen journalism, which further advanced this trend towards decentralization.  Yet today, according to the Pew Research Center and others, we find ourselves at an unprecedented moment of distrust towards government and media. How did this happen if we were on such a positive trajectory?  The hidden hand of central control  Our systems of checks and balances were designed to protect us against centralization of power in a way that we can all see. They address issues that are visible, and do so in a visible manner.  But now we face invisible centralization, and this must be addressed as well. Invisible centralization happens gradually then all at once, and it almost always involves emerging technology.  Take, for example, machine learning and AI. Both provide outcomes based on complex data analysis. They process unfathomable quantities of information, find correlations beyond human comprehension, then act on these findings without human input. These technologies have transfixed the world in how quickly they have advanced, but most people can not see this progress as it develops. Much of it is occuring behind closed doors and at just a handful of corporations. This means the threat of centralized AI could become imminent before we are even able to grasp its true scope.  Or consider the internet – the greatest innovation of our time and the most decentralized technology in existence. The internet has given voice to billions of people around the world. As it evolved, communication channels like forums and message boards emerged that brought people together and gave them a platform.  But the culmination of these channels, social media, has in many ways swung the pendulum the other way. The U.S. government has threatened to ban TikTok, a platform that 170 million Americans use daily. Do you think it’s because they’re worried about the latest dance moves, or are there more nefarious motives at play? Across the pond, the U.K. government has threatened to imprison individuals based on their online posts. In both cases, centralized power is encroaching on basic rights in a way that would not have been possible before the advent of these technologies.  While this invisible centralization may be difficult to detect, it’s impacting your life (yes, I am speaking to you now, reader). Your right to build an online identity on the platform of your choosing is under threat. Your basic right to express your opinion is under threat. Years ago this would have been incomprehensible. Today, it is our reality.  Ask yourself this: What is stopping Apple from deleting your memories? Or Google deleting your exchanges? This invisible centralization could get much worse. We’ve only seen a glimpse of its potentially devastating impact with the recent Crowdstrike fiasco – one of the biggest IT outages in history that impacted 8.5 million Windows devices. What’s keeping us from facing an even bigger centralized collapse?  Luckily, the tools to counter these alarming trends are now within our reach.  Decentralization as democratization  Decentralization simply means power, authority and decision-making is distributed. Since the internet, the best force for decentralization to emerge is blockchain, which enables decentralized structures to exist at scale, ensuring verification, security, and transparency.  The easiest way to understand blockchain’s decentralizing impact is to return to the idea of checks and balances. In centralized structures, checks and balances occur “top down” with individuals verifying each step of the way on a need-to-know basis. In decentralized structures, checks and balances occur “bottom up,” with a token verifying a source of truth on a blockchain in full transparency. The implications of this shift are dramatic, as blockchain will not merely improve existing checks and balances, it will remove checks and balances that are no longer necessary. While this efficiency will unfortunately cost jobs, the significance of decentralization is bigger than any one government or company.  It will also benefit far more people than it will temporarily hurt. Money transfers and remittances are possibly the best real-world example of this. Last year, Venezuelan migrants sent $5B home, making up 6% of the country’s GDP. But with transaction fees as high as 7% across traditional bank and retail businesses like Western Union, decentralized solutions that use blockchain technology offered a much more attractive alternative that’s significantly cheaper and quicker. Venezuelans took full advantage of this, and nearly $500 million of that $5 billion was sent home via blockchain. This resulted in more money reaching individuals in need rather than being rerouted to centralized entities making profits off transfers.  A crossroads  History is littered with examples like this, where technology breaks down traditionally centralized structures. Today, as our trust wanes in these traditional structures, we are actually presented with a very exciting alternative. And, while a balance must be struck between the centralized structures we know today and the decentralized options with which we are beginning to be presented, it is ultimately our choice to make.  So when we look out at society’s current landscape, where power is unevenly distributed and becoming more concentrated in the areas that matter most, the fundamental question we should ask ourselves is:  Does it have to be this way?

Tron On-chain Developments Drive TRX Sky High With Tron’s focus on stablecoin development made apparent by Tron founder Justin Sun last month, yesterday saw a big win for the platform as Tether minted over $1 billion USDT without paying any gas fees on the platform. This placed Tron in the crosshairs of critics as they questioned the “no gas fee” transaction with an individual pointing out that they are charged a dollar for a simple swap approval. Our team is developing a new solution that enables gas-free stablecoin transfers. In other words, transfers can be made without paying any gas tokens, with the fees being entirely covered by the stablecoins themselves. — H.E.

The token’s current position is an awkward balance between the bulls attempting to break through the $0.1665 ceiling and the bears also attempting the reverse by eyeing the $0.1583 floor. As it currently stands, TRX is on an untenable position as it forces the bulls to continue buying without regard to the token’s overall momentum. The relative strength index (RSI) supports this as it nears to push the limits of the bullish momentum, with a possible cool-down period in the next couple of days. Accounting the market’s general momentum, we might see TRX stabilize on its current trading range between $0.1583 and $0.1665 in the short term. The RSI’s near maxed-out value indicates a possible retracement to the $0.1532 floor before opening the floodgates to the $0.1665. Related Reading: End Of The Slump? Floki Eyes A 46% Price Surge — Analyst This scenario is possible as TRX will eventually lose its current momentum to follow the consensus dip within the broader market. The dip, although bearish in some regards, will allow the bulls to rest before building up the momentum for bigger gains. With improving macroeconomic conditions also supporting this bullish thesis, we might more gains as capital from private equity flows to more risky investment products like crypto. For now, monitoring the broader market will benefit investors as TRX moves to more sustainable levels.

42417382,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYGzN,1724266389,"After 2022’s Bust, Scars Are Healing In Crypto Lending","In 2022, the crypto lending market had collapsed after a series of devastating events including the fall of LUNA/UST, the insolvency of Three Arrows Capital, and the FTX bankruptcy. Many key lenders that provided a substantial share of the lending market’s volumes were forced to close their doors after this period including BlockFi, Celsius, Voyager, and Genesis. However, one of the few silver linings coming out of this period was that it exposed the many issues that existed within the market structure and provided a blueprint for how to build a healthier ecosystem in the next cycle.  The crypto lending market had peaked in 2021-2022 amid outsized crypto returns and years of low-interest rate environments. With loan defaults uncommon in bull markets, and investors clamoring for top-line growth, many crypto lenders found themselves in a race for absolute yields with risk-pricing and portfolio health being a secondary concern.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Increasing competitive pressures on structure/terms led to a proliferation of unsecured lending, relaxed underwriting/diligence standards, and growing allocations in high-yield DeFi strategies. This highly-levered environment became a tinderbox when a few bad catalysts brought everything down.  Two years later, the market looks very different and we are finally starting to see strong signals of recovery. Catalyzed in part by the launch of Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. in January, institutional lenders have seen rapid expansion in 2024. Some examples of this from publicly reported data can be seen below:  Coinbase Prime’s financing business reported that its loan book increased +75% QoQ from $399mm to $700mm in 1Q24  Ledn, a crypto lending platform, publicly reported $584mm of institutional loans issued in 1Q24, a +400% increase QoQ  Membrane, a loan technology provider (and my employer; full disclosure), reported that the first-half of 2024 saw 3x the loan bookings of the full-year 2023  Risk Management Practices  Lenders are placing a heavy emphasis on risk management, keen to not incur loan losses and maintain the trust of their counterparties. In a stark contrast to 2021, detailed entity diligence and verification of assets are now standard onboarding practices.  Over-collateralized lending has become the dominant share of loan activity and many borrowers are insisting that their collateral be held in tri-party with a custodian. A much smaller share of the market, unsecured lending is now typically restricted to specific well-capitalized borrowers and often includes structural protections and/or ongoing monitoring requirements.  Transparency has also been a focus as many lenders, and their capital providers, are demanding visibility to monitor their borrowers’ use of loan proceeds while many borrowers will demand an ongoing line-of-sight into the wallets where their collateral is held.  New Participants & Innovative Technologies  The growth of new lenders coming to market may now be greater than at any point since 2021. Swiss banks, such as Sygnum, Amina, Dukascopy and others, have gradually entered the market and other large institutions from traditional financial markets are also moving into the space as exemplified by Cantor Fitzgerald’s announcement of a new Bitcoin financing business with $2B in initial funding. These new entrants will be able to both supply capital to the broader trading community as well as to crypto’s existing lenders, ultimately driving a more robust and liquid market.  Large custodians like BitGo and Copper have leaned into prime financing businesses, many new credit funds have launched in the APAC region, and several ETF issuers are actively exploring how to deploy their assets to generate yield.  Improved tools for loan and collateral management have empowered many of these lenders to mitigate risk and expand their product offerings. A prime example of this is the lending platform Trident Digital that has built products for offering leverage to trading firms without ever requiring funds to come off-exchange, providing traders the benefit of capital efficiency while lenders always remain over-collateralized.  From more efficient risk-based margin capabilities to visibility into use of loan proceeds, institutions now have a wider range of tools at their disposal to reduce counterparty risk and increase confidence in transacting with new partners.  The sustainability of crypto financing and its continued growth hinges on balancing innovation with risk management. Prudent risk management practices paired with tools that provide transparent, secure, and efficient lending services are critical to building a robust and efficient crypto lending market.

42417384,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYH0P,1724265059,Can Crypto Sway the U.S. Election?,"As the U.S. election approaches, political polarization is once again front and center. The country remains deeply divided, with the electorate split nearly 50/50 along party lines. The presidential race is shaping up to be too-close-to-call, especially with the recent resurgence of the Democratic ticket. The outcome will have significant implications for the future of the digital asset industry.  Which raises an important question: Is the cryptocurrency sector influential enough to sway the election?  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  The answer appears to be “yes.” Elections are won by money and mobilization, not just by ideas. That’s the reality of the political landscape. Politicians can be influenced, if not outright bought, and this election cycle marks the first time the crypto industry has a well-funded, organized lobby to support its interests. Crypto-focused Political Action Committees (PACs) have raised $183 million to influence the 2024 elections, according to followthecrypto.org. Major players in Silicon Valley are seizing this opportunity to use their wealth and influence to shape future policies on digital assets and artificial intelligence.  Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, has welcomed these efforts, pledging strong support for the crypto industry. His proposals include revamping U.S. energy policy to position the country as a global leader in Bitcoin mining, ending ""Operation Chokepoint 2.0,"" removing Gary Gensler as SEC Chair, and even creating a national strategic “reserve” of Bitcoin. The crypto industry has responded enthusiastically, pouring money into his campaign. Whether he follows through on these promises remains to be seen.  On the Democratic side, the nominee has been largely silent on crypto, though the current administration’s aggressive crackdown on the industry has left many skeptics. Many Democrats now acknowledge that SEC Chairman Gensler has become a political liability, and that young voters in a few crucial swing states will influence the outcome of the election.  So why has the future of crypto regulation become such a hot-button political issue? The answer again is simple: money. Not just the large sums being funneled into this election, but the growing institutional interest in the industry itself, spurred by the advent of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Larry Fink, Chairman and CEO of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has emerged as a leading advocate, touting the benefits of Bitcoin and blockchain technology.  The crypto industry has evolved significantly, with over 50 million Americans owning digital assets.  Crypto has always been inherently political, challenging the very foundations of centralized markets. The principles of decentralization, transparency, financial inclusion, autonomy, and ownership have far-reaching implications for all aspects of our financial lives.  Politicians tend to follow the money, and voters often cast their ballots based on economic self-interest. The American penchant for libertarian ideals is now intersecting with the fight for the future of digital assets. The political climate is increasingly favorable toward sensible regulations, with numerous crypto-friendly bills circulating on Capitol Hill.  Could this election finally propel crypto into the mainstream? Given the stakes, it certainly seems possible. In this context, being a single-issue voter isn't unreasonable, especially if your financial future is on the line. However, it's worth considering whether this could turn into a classic case of ""buy the rumor, sell the news.""

32684820,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637059,1724264757,"Aave vs Mpeppe: Both Predicted To Explode By 1000%, Here’s Why","Certain tokens stand out due to their explosive growth potential and innovative features. Currently, Aave (AAVE) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are capturing the attention of investors, with both tokens being predicted to surge by 1000% in the near future. Here’s an in-depth look at what’s driving the bullish sentiment for these two promising assets. Aave (AAVE): A DeFi Giant on the Verge of a Breakout Aave (AAVE) has been a dominant force in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, providing users with a robust platform for lending and borrowing digital assets. Recently, Aave (AAVE) has been making headlines for its significant price rally, which is being fueled by increased interest from crypto whales and a surge in on-chain activity. Over the past 10 days, Aave (AAVE) has seen a 50% price increase, pushing it past the $137 mark. The current price of $138.15 is just the beginning, according to analysts, who predict that Aave could reach $286 in the coming weeks, representing a 106% increase from its current level. This rally is supported by technical indicators such as the MACD line forming a bullish crossover and the alignment of the 50-week and 200-week EMAs. Moreover, Aave’s recent Skyward initiative, which simplifies governance within the Aave (AAVE) DAO, is driving more user engagement and solidifying the platform’s position in the DeFi space. As more whales and active addresses accumulate Aave (AAVE), the token’s upward momentum is expected to continue, potentially leading to a 1000% gain in the long term. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Meme Coin with Massive Potential While Aave (AAVE) continues its impressive run in the DeFi space, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is making waves in the meme coin market. Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on viral popularity, Mpeppe is backed by innovative features and a strategic growth plan that could see it deliver substantial returns to early investors. Mpeppe is currently in Stage 3 of its Initial Coin Offering (ICO) and has already raised over $1.158 million, with 75.40% of its tokens sold. The current price of Mpeppe (MPEPE) is $0.001777, making it an attractive entry point for those looking to capitalize on its growth potential. What sets Mpeppe (MPEPE) apart is its focus on the rapidly growing gambling sector, a market that is ripe for disruption through blockchain technology. As Mpeppe (MPEPE) moves closer to Stage 4 of its ICO, the token’s price is expected to increase to $0.0021, offering early investors a potential windfall. Additionally, Mpeppe is offering a 20% bonus for those who invest using the promo code MPEPE20, further incentivizing participation in this promising project. Mpeppe’s roadmap includes several key milestones, such as the development of partnerships with major players in the online gambling industry and the launch of a dedicated gambling platform. These initiatives are designed to drive demand for Mpeppe and increase its value, making it a strong contender for exponential growth. Why Both Tokens Are Set for a 1000% Surge The potential for both Aave (AAVE) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) to explode by 1000% is grounded in their unique value propositions and the current market conditions. For Aave (AAVE), its strong technical indicators, increased whale activity, and innovative features like the Skyward initiative position it well for continued growth in the DeFi sector. On the other hand, Mpeppe’s focus on the gambling industry, combined with its low entry price and strategic growth plan, makes it a highly attractive investment in the meme coin space. As the token moves through its ICO stages, the potential for significant returns becomes increasingly clear. Conclusion: A Strategic Investment Opportunity Both Aave (AAVE) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) offer unique opportunities for investors looking to capitalize on the next big wave in cryptocurrency. Aave’s established presence in the DeFi sector and its ongoing technical improvements make it a solid bet for long-term growth. Meanwhile, Mpeppe’s innovative approach to the gambling sector and its strategic ICO stages position it for massive gains in the meme coin market. For investors willing to take calculated risks, these two tokens present an exciting opportunity to achieve substantial returns. Whether you’re drawn to Aave’s (AAVE) strong fundamentals or Mpeppe’s (MPEPE) high-growth potential, now might be the perfect time to consider adding these assets to your portfolio.

32685561,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637068,1724264756,TRON: Top Tron Investors Lose Faith In Justin Sun & Join New $0.001777 Cryptocurrency,"The sentiment of crypto investors can shift rapidly, and the latest buzz is around Tron (TRX) investors seeking greener pastures. Despite recent gains, top Tron (TRX) investors are reportedly losing faith in Justin Sun’s vision and are flocking to a new cryptocurrency that is currently priced at $0.001777. This emerging token, Mpeppe (MPEPE), is drawing significant attention for its innovative approach and growth potential. Here’s why this migration is happening and what it means for the future of Tron (TRX). Tron’s Recent Performance: A Mixed Bag Tron (TRX) has had a notable year, with a recent chart analysis showing that it outperformed many other altcoins, even displacing Cardano from the top 10 in market capitalization. The token recently surged by 40%, demonstrating resilience in a market that has seen significant volatility. The TRX token bounced off a long-standing support level, suggesting potential for further gains, with short-term targets between 18 and 22 cents. However, despite these positive indicators, some red flags have emerged. Divergences in the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) suggest that Tron (TRX) may be due for a short- to mid-term correction. These technical signals are causing concern among investors, leading some to reassess their positions in Tron (TRX). Concerns Over Tron’s Leadership and Long-Term Vision Another reason for the shift in sentiment among Tron (TRX) investors is growing skepticism about the long-term vision under Justin Sun’s leadership. While Sun has been a vocal and ambitious leader, his approach has sometimes been seen as overly promotional, leading to concerns about the sustainability of Tron (TRX) as a long-term investment. The crypto community is abuzz with discussions about whether Tron (TRX) can maintain its upward trajectory or if it will face challenges as it seeks to break past key resistance levels. Some investors are wary that the recent gains might be short-lived, especially in the face of potential market corrections and the uncertainties surrounding Sun’s strategic decisions. The Allure of Mpeppe (MPEPE) at $0.001777 Amid these concerns, a new cryptocurrency, Mpeppe (MPEPE), priced at $0.001777, has captured the attention of former Tron (TRX) investors. This new project is not just another altcoin; it brings a unique value proposition that appeals to those looking for growth potential outside of the Tron (TRX) ecosystem. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is designed with innovative features, particularly in the gaming sector, where it aims to integrate blockchain technology with gaming applications. With a focus on decentralized gaming platforms, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is poised to take advantage of the growing interest in blockchain-based gaming, a sector that has seen tremendous growth over the past few years. For Tron (TRX) investors who are concerned about the potential for a short-term correction and the long-term direction of Tron (TRX), Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers an attractive alternative. Its low entry price combined with the potential for high returns makes it an appealing option for those looking to diversify their crypto portfolios. Why This Migration Matters The migration of top Tron (TRX) investors to Mpeppe (MPEPE) signals a broader trend in the crypto market. It highlights the importance of innovation and adaptability in a rapidly evolving landscape. While Tron (TRX) has established itself as a major player, the emergence of new projects like Mpeppe (MPEPE) with strong utility and growth potential shows that the market is always looking for the next big thing. Mpeppe (MPEPE) stands out with its focus on the gaming industry, offering a unique blend of blockchain technology and gaming utility. This innovative approach is resonating with investors who are keen on capturing opportunities in a fast-growing market. The shift from Tron (TRX) to Mpeppe (MPEPE) underscores the importance of staying ahead of market trends and being open to new possibilities. Conclusion: A Strategic Shift in the Crypto Landscape As Tron (TRX) faces potential headwinds, the migration of its top investors to Mpeppe (MPEPE) underscores the dynamic nature of the crypto market. While Tron (TRX) continues to be a significant player, the allure of new opportunities and the need for diversification are driving investors to explore alternatives like Mpeppe (MPEPE). This strategic shift highlights the need for ongoing innovation and adaptability in the crypto space. As the market continues to evolve, those who can identify and capitalize on emerging trends will be best positioned to succeed. Whether Tron (TRX) can overcome its current challenges and regain investor confidence remains to be seen, but for now, the spotlight is on Mpeppe (MPEPE) as the next potential breakout star.

32685447,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637066,1724264754,SUI Investors Enter New SUI Rival Priced $0.001777 With Gaming Utility,"Recently, the Sui Network (SUI) has been garnering attention for its innovative approach to decentralized finance (DeFi) and high-performance applications. However, as Sui Network (SUI) continues to rise, some of its investors are looking to diversify their portfolios by investing in a new and promising cryptocurrency, Mpeppe (MPEPE), currently priced at $0.001777, that offers unique gaming utility. Let’s explore why this shift is happening and what makes Mpeppe (MPEPE) a compelling rival to Sui Network (SUI). Sui Network (SUI): A Leader in Speed and Scalability Sui Network (SUI) has made significant strides in the blockchain space, particularly with its ability to process an astounding 297,000 transactions per second (TPS) and its low transaction fees. This level of performance places it ahead of many competitors, including Solana, earning it the reputation of a potential “Ethereum killer.” Sui Network (SUI) is designed to support high-performance decentralized applications (dApps), making it a strong contender in the smart contract platform space. The Sui Network (SUI) is not only fast but also highly scalable, which has attracted the attention of major industry players and partnerships with companies like Byteplus and Cloud-Giganten. Its innovative consensus mechanism and architecture are optimized for efficiency and user experience, addressing many of the challenges that traditional blockchain systems face. With these advantages, Sui Network (SUI) has positioned itself as a standout in the crowded market of smart contract platforms. The Rise of a New Rival: Mpeppe (MPEPE) with Gaming Utility While Sui Network (SUI) continues to make headlines, a new cryptocurrency, Mpeppe (MPEPE), is emerging as a potential rival, offering a unique blend of blockchain technology and gaming utility. Priced at just $0.001777 during its Initial Coin Offering (ICO), Mpeppe (MPEPE) is attracting attention for its potential to revolutionize the gaming industry by integrating blockchain technology with gaming applications. Unlike Sui Network (SUI), which focuses primarily on decentralized finance and high-performance dApps, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is designed to serve the growing gaming market. It leverages the blockchain to provide a decentralized platform for gamers, offering features such as in-game asset ownership, decentralized marketplaces, and play-to-earn opportunities. These features make Mpeppe (MPEPE) a compelling choice for investors looking to capitalize on the growing intersection of gaming and blockchain technology. Why Sui Network (SUI) Investors Are Diversifying into Mpeppe (MPEPE) Complementary Investment: While Sui Network (SUI) is focused on high-speed transactions and scalability for dApps, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a different value proposition. By investing in both, investors can benefit from the strengths of each, reducing risk through diversification while still positioning themselves for potential high returns. Early Entry Point: Mpeppe’s (MPEPE) current price of $0.001777 offers an attractive entry point for early investors. As seen with other successful ICOs, getting in early can result in significant returns, especially if the project gains traction within the gaming community and beyond. Gaming Industry Growth: The gaming industry is one of the fastest-growing sectors globally, with billions of dollars in revenue generated each year. The integration of blockchain technology into gaming through Mpeppe (MPEPE) could unlock new revenue streams and create a robust ecosystem where gamers and developers alike benefit from decentralized platforms. Potential for High Returns: While Sui Network (SUI) has already proven its capability in the blockchain space, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers the potential for exponential growth. With the gaming industry’s expansion and the increasing adoption of blockchain in gaming, Mpeppe (MPEPE) could see its value skyrocket, providing investors with substantial returns. The Strategic Appeal of Investing in Both Sui Network (SUI) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) Investors in Sui Network (SUI) are recognizing the strategic benefits of diversifying into Mpeppe (MPEPE). By holding both tokens, they can capitalize on the strengths of each platform—whether it’s the high-speed, scalable transactions of Sui Network (SUI) or the innovative gaming utilities offered by Mpeppe (MPEPE). Moreover, Mpeppe’s (MPEPE) integration of blockchain with gaming could lead to a new wave of adoption, similar to how Sui Network (SUI) is transforming the DeFi and dApp landscape. This diversification strategy not only mitigates risk but also positions investors to benefit from the growth of two dynamic sectors within the blockchain space. Conclusion: A Balanced Portfolio for the Future As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, investors are increasingly seeking opportunities that offer both stability and growth potential. Sui Network (SUI) remains a strong player in the blockchain space, but Mpeppe (MPEPE) presents a unique opportunity for those looking to diversify their portfolios and tap into the lucrative gaming industry. By investing in both Sui Network (SUI) and Mpeppe (MPEPE), investors can balance their portfolios with assets that are poised for growth in different areas of the blockchain ecosystem.

But as SuperRare continues to break new ground, another cryptocurrency is quietly gaining traction and preparing for what could be an explosive launch—Mpeppe (MPEPE).

The token’s recent rally, fueled by a combination of technical indicators and growing investor interest, has seen it break through key resistance levels, positioning it for further gains.

The bullish sentiment surrounding SuperRare (RARE) is further supported by the MACD indicator, which is on the verge of triggering a bullish flag, signaling the potential for continued upward momentum. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Next 1000X Opportunity While SuperRare (RARE) continues to attract attention, savvy investors are also turning their gaze towards Mpeppe (MPEPE), a new cryptocurrency that is poised to deliver significant returns.

With the backing of a strong community and a clear vision for the future, Mpeppe is well-positioned to deliver impressive returns in the coming months. The Intersection of Art and Meme Culture Both SuperRare (RARE) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) highlight the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency, where art, culture, and finance intersect in innovative ways. SuperRare’s platform, which focuses on the curation and sale of digital art, has already made a significant impact in the NFT space.

32685113,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637064,1724264703,"Render Whales Invest $500K In New Render Like Cryptocurrency, Here’s Why","Market trends can shift rapidly, and strategic investments by crypto whales—those with significant capital, often signal emerging opportunities. Recently, a group of Render (RNDR) whales made headlines by collectively investing $500K in a new cryptocurrency that mirrors many of Render’s strengths while also offering fresh potential for exponential growth. As Render (RNDR) faces market pressures ahead of NVIDIA’s Q2 earnings report, these whales are betting on a promising new project, Mpeppe (MPEPE), to potentially replicate or even surpass RNDR’s success. Here’s why this move has captured the attention of the crypto community. Render (RNDR): Facing Downward Pressure Amid NVIDIA Earnings Render (RNDR), an AI-based altcoin, has been under significant pressure recently, with its price declining by 6% over the past week. Despite a brief recovery, RNDR’s trajectory suggests that a further correction could be imminent. The downturn comes as NVIDIA Corporation, a key player in the AI and GPU sectors, prepares to announce its second-quarter earnings. Historically, NVIDIA’s earnings have influenced AI-related altcoins like RNDR, driving market rallies or exacerbating downturns depending on the results. Currently, Render (RNDR) is trading at $4.55, down 3% in just 24 hours, hovering dangerously close to the $4.5 support level. With trading volume and open interest declining by 25.60% and 8%, respectively, the market sentiment around RNDR is one of caution. Analysts are watching closely to see if NVIDIA’s earnings will provide the catalyst needed to reverse this downward trend or if further declines are on the horizon. The Strategic Shift: Why Whales Are Eyeing Mpeppe (MPEPE) Given the current uncertainty surrounding Render (RNDR), it’s no surprise that savvy investors are looking for alternatives that offer similar growth potential but with less market volatility. This search for new opportunities has led a group of Render (RNDR) whales to invest $500K in Mpeppe (MPEPE), a new cryptocurrency that shares many of RNDR’s attributes but is positioned at the beginning of its growth cycle. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is designed to capitalize on the growing demand for blockchain-based solutions, much like Render (RNDR). However, it aims to address some of the challenges Render (RNDR) faces, such as scalability and market saturation, by offering a more streamlined and efficient platform. The early-stage nature of this project provides a significant upside for those who get in early, especially as it moves through its initial coin offering (ICO) stages. Why Mpeppe (MPEPE) Could Be the Next Big Thing Blockchain Integration and Utility: Mpeppe (MPEPE) integrates cutting-edge blockchain technology with a focus on scalability and efficiency. This makes it an attractive option for investors who believe in the long-term potential of decentralized platforms. Mpeppe’s blockchain infrastructure is built to handle high transaction volumes without the bottlenecks that have plagued other platforms like Render (RNDR). Early-Stage Investment Potential: With Mpeppe currently priced at just $0.001777, early investors stand to benefit from significant price appreciation as the platform gains traction. The $500K investment by Render (RNDR) whales is a strong vote of confidence in the project’s potential, signaling that Mpeppe could be a major player in the blockchain space in the near future. Strategic Market Positioning: The timing of this investment is also noteworthy. As Render (RNDR) faces downward pressure, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is gaining momentum, offering an attractive alternative for those looking to diversify their portfolios and hedge against potential losses in RNDR. With Mpeppe’s upcoming stages in the ICO, the price is expected to rise, making early entry even more lucrative. The Road Ahead: What to Expect As NVIDIA prepares to release its Q2 earnings, the future of Render (RNDR) remains uncertain. While the earnings report could provide the boost needed to drive RNDR back towards $10, the current market sentiment is cautious. In contrast, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a fresh opportunity, with the potential to replicate or even exceed RNDR’s success. For investors, the choice is clear: continue to ride the wave with Render (RNDR), hoping for a turnaround, or diversify into new opportunities like Mpeppe (MPEPE) that offer significant upside potential with less immediate risk. The $500K investment by Render (RNDR) whales in Mpeppe suggests that the smart money is already making its move. As the market continues to evolve, keeping an eye on both Render (RNDR) and emerging projects like Mpeppe (MPEPE) will be crucial for investors looking to maximize their returns in the ever-changing world of digital assets.

32686580,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637048,1724264534,Bitcoin Derivatives Signal Major Risk Of Explosive ‘Short Squeeze’ Rally Ahead,"As the world’s largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), continues to consolidate between the $58,000 and $60,000 price range with no clear direction, a bullish signal from the derivatives market suggests the potential for sudden and sharp rallies ahead for BTC’s price. Data Shows Aggressive Bitcoin Shorting According to crypto research firm K33 Research, the funding rate for Bitcoin perpetual futures has reached its lowest since March 2023, when the US bank failures rattled investors. This indicates a prevalence of downside bets, or short positions, on the cryptocurrency. K33 analysts Vetle Lunde and David Zimmerman wrote in a note: Perpetual swap funding rates have averaged at negative levels over the past week, while open interest has sharply increased. This suggests aggressive shorting, structurally creating a setup ripe for a short squeeze. Related Reading: XRP Alert: Raoul Pal Advises Investors To Sell Now – Here’s Why A short squeeze occurs when a sudden and unexpected price increase forces traders with short positions to close their bets, further fueling the rally. This can stoke further price recoveries for Bitcoin as traders rush to cover their bearish positions. In the perpetual market, K33 Research further noted that the notional open interest, or the total value of outstanding contracts, rose by almost 29,000 BTC over the past week. According to the analysts, the seven-day average annualized funding rate on August 20th was a negative 2.5%, a relatively rare backdrop. This combination suggests that traders have been actively building short positions, setting the stage for a potential short squeeze that could push the price above key resistance walls that have not been breached this week as the market struggles with a notable lack of bullish catalysts. Short-Term Bearish Pressure For BTC? According to an Inspo Crypto analysis, the options data suggests that the $60,500 level remains a significant challenge for the bulls, with the potential for heightened volatility around this price point. One key indicator is the Implied Volatility (IV) curve, which shows a spike around the $60,500 level. This suggests that traders expect significant price action around this zone, as evidenced by the elevated delta and gamma values, which measure the sensitivity of option prices to changes in the underlying asset’s price. Related Reading: Here’s What’s Going On With The Shiba Inu Price Further, the market sentiment appears to be a mix of bullish and bearish positions. While the heavy use of bullish strategies like Bull Call Spreads and Reverse Put Calendars suggests a more positive outlook among traders, the increasing skew toward negative values indicates that traders are seeking more downside protection through put options. According to the analyst, this heightened activity suggests that the probability of a failed retest at this level is elevated, and the options market could exacerbate any subsequent price action. It is key for the BTC price to close the week above this crucial level for the potential to continue the recovery over the past two weeks after falling to the $49,000 mark earlier this month. Conversely, lower support levels would be tested with the risk of positioning the largest cryptocurrency on the market in a sharp correction, as seen in the past months after reaching its all-time high of $73,700 in March. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $59,870, up nearly 2% in the last 24 hours.

32684941,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=636928,1724261447,"Dogwifhat (WIF) Holds Strong Above $1.5, Is A Bigger Rally Imminent?","Dogwifhat (WIF) continues to maintain bullish momentum above the crucial $1.5 level, following a successful breakout above this level. This sustained momentum has sparked speculation about whether the asset is gearing up for a more significant rally or if this momentum might eventually lose steam. As WIF remains resilient above the $1.5 level, this article will offer a technical analysis, utilizing key indicators to assess its current price performance and evaluate the potential for a larger rally, providing insight into the implications for the asset’s future. In the last 24 hours, Dogwifhat has gained a 5.03% increase, reaching approximately $1.53. The meme coin’s market capitalization has surpassed $1.5 billion, with trading volume exceeding $421 million. Over this period, the market cap has increased by 4.64%, while trading volume has surged by 49.84%. Current Price Action: Evaluating Dogwifhat Performance Above $1.5 Dogwifhat currently, is displaying bullish resilience above the $1.5 level, trading slightly below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) on the 4-hour chart. If the cryptocurrency maintains its strength above this key level, it could potentially set the stage for a larger rally. Also, the position of the Composite Trend Oscillator indicator shows that WIF could be poised for further price gains. The signal line and the SMA of the indicator have risen above the zero line, suggesting that bullish pressure remains strong in the market. On the daily chart, WIF’s price is holding steady after a successful breakout above the $1.5 mark. This resilience suggests that the bulls may continue to dominate, potentially driving the price higher towards the $2.2 mark and the 100-day SMA. Finally, the 1-day composite trend oscillator indicator suggests that Dogwifhat has a strong potential to extend its bullish movement. Both the signal line and the SMA of the indicator are currently in the overbought zone, with the signal line attempting to cross above the SMA. This suggests that an additional upside move could be imminent for the cryptocurrency. Potential For A Larger Rally: What to Watch Out For As WIF’s price continues to maintain its current resilience above the $1.5 mark, it is expected that the crypto asset could start a rally toward the next key resistance level at $2.2. Should the price break and close above this level, Dogwifhat may continue its bullish move toward the next resistance point at $3.58 and potentially advance to even higher areas. However, if WIF faces resistance at the $2.2 mark and experiences a rejection, it might begin to decline towards the $1.5 level. When the price breaks below this support, it could signal more bearish movement, potentially leading to further declines toward the $1.02 mark and beyond.

42417379,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYGwH,1724257730,Blockchain vs. Transfer Agents: A Call for Genuine Market Innovation,"The two most popular tokenized money market funds today, according to the latest data from rwa.xyz, are BlackRock’s $BUIDL and Franklin Templeton’s $FOBXX. Collectively, they are nearing $1 billion in assets, largely from investors excited to access the benefits of a blockchain-enabled financial product.  While these products introduced an important innovation into the market, they also expose a duplicity prevalent in today’s tokenized fund and digital asset market infrastructure: Projects touting blockchain innovation are partnering with traditional transfer agents, creating redundant systems by not utilizing blockchain technology to its fullest capabilities.  The question that needs to be asked is what’s the difference between a digital asset and a digital receipt? A digital asset is blockchain native when it exists on a public blockchain, which serves as the source of truth and records ownership of the actual asset. In contrast, a digital receipt is merely information printed on a blockchain where the blockchain is not the source of truth.  Read more: Controversial Crypto Firm Prometheum to Treat Uniswap and Arbitrum's Tokens as Securities  The fundamental difference to understand is the source of truth. This distinction is essential as it directly impacts the true progress of blockchain-based financial ecosystems.  Enabling an ecosystem where digital assets can be issued natively onchain is crucial to advancing trends such as tokenization and truly innovating financial markets. But for this to occur, blockchain technology needs to replace redundant legacy constructs such as transfer agents.  What’s the difference between a digital asset and a digital receipt?  Transfer agents – banks, trust companies, or other financial institutions – have managed investor records and transactions since the 1970s. While they alleviated paper-based inefficiencies in their time, they now represent an outdated middleman. Transfer agent-based market infrastructure is the exact type of anachronism that having securities exist onchain (i.e. tokenization) is meant to eliminate.  Despite this, a majority of blockchain-enabled infrastructure solutions currently in the market deploy a hybrid transfer agent and blockchain model. The transfer agent manages security certificates of ownership as the single source of truth, and those records are then mirrored onto the blockchain, providing a digital receipt of ownership.  Mirroring transfer agent records on the blockchain is a costly duplication of effort that reintroduces complexity and inefficiency into market infrastructure. Why do we still use transfer agents if blockchain can fulfill that role – i.e. the record of the source of truth of ownership of that asset – more efficiently? This redundancy undermines the very benefits blockchain aims to provide such as transparency, speed, and efficiency.  Authentic blockchain-enabled market structure promises transparency, tamper-proof records, reduced costs (as compared to doing both blockchain and security certificates) for the issuer and the end customer, and smart contracts that execute automatically under predefined conditions. This brand of innovation renders traditional transfer agents obsolete, as blockchain verifies and validates securities ownership.  Read more: Prometheum's Contentious Answer to Crypto Compliance Is Running Late  For blockchain technology to truly innovate financial market infrastructure, we must develop technology from the ground up that uses new means of efficiency (i. e. blockchains ) to introduce efficiencies into traditional securities processes. This shift empowers the tokenization of real-world assets, enables the direct issuance of securities onchain, and unlocks a more efficient, transparent market structure.  Blockchain can revolutionize financial market infrastructure, but only if the industry is being honest about what is real and what is not. Half-measures are merely facades masquerading as innovation. They are a sign of market stagnation rather than progress.  To drive genuine innovation, we must move beyond these outdated practices and fully commit to blockchain’s transformative potential.  A digital receipt is not a tokenized asset, rather a marketing exercise mimicking the source of truth.

32682025,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=636935,1724256051,Here’s What’s Going On With The Shiba Inu Price,"The Shiba Inu (SHIB) price has remained lackluster for a while now, with the second-largest meme coin by market cap still below the crucial price level at $0.00002. This unimpressive price action is thanks to several factors, including Bitcoin’s tepid price movement. Why The Shiba Inu Price Is Down Shiba Inu’s price has been on a downtrend mainly due to its strong positive price correlation with Bitcoin. Data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock shows that Shiba Inu’s price correlation with Bitcoin is currently at 0.94 and nearing its peak at 1. As such, the meme coin’s price is imitating the flagship crypto’s price action. Related Reading: Dogecoin Faces Supply Squeeze: What This Means For Price Bitcoin has struggled these past few days to hold above the $60,000 support level, and Shiba Inu is also in a similar situation as it continues to swing below and above the $0.000014 price level. Bitcoin’s weak price action has been attributed to the significant slowdown in its demand growth, which can also be said about Shiba Inu. Further data from IntoTheBlock shows that the interest in the meme coin has been on the decline for a while now, even among whales. Shiba Inu’s large transactions have remained flat and bearish, highlighting the lack of confidence these Shiba Inu whales have in the meme coin’s trajectory. These whales have been integral in keeping Shiba Inu’s price afloat, especially as there has been a lack of new investors in the meme coin’s ecosystem. Daily new addresses on Shiba Inu have continued to range between 1,000 and 2,000 over the last three months. Meanwhile, the total number of addresses with a balance has remained around 1 million since the start of the year. With such a bearish outlook, Shiba Inu’s price is undoubtedly at risk of further decline. The meme coin could drop lower if Bitcoin fails to reclaim and hold above $60,000 soon enough. This could also spark a massive wave of sell-offs, as over 52% of Shiba Inu holders are currently out of the money, leading to more downward pressure. A Positive Amid The Storm The layer-2 network Shibarium experienced a massive spike in its daily transactions, rising to 28,680 on August 20 from a meager 1,740 the previous day. This development is significant, considering that the network’s daily transactions have ranged between 1,000 and 4,000 over the last 30 days. Shibarium’s daily transactions have also drastically declined since the start of the year. Related Reading: Bitcoin Maintains Market Dominance With $42 Million In Inflows However, it remains to be seen if this surge recorded on August 20 marks the beginning of an increase in the daily transactions on the network. If so, it could positively impact Shiba Inu’s price since increased network activity on Shibarium leads to more Shiba Inu burns, ultimately affecting its price. At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading at around $0.00001375, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42417381,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYGyL,1724256000,DePIN Media Network PKT Starts Up on Coinbase's Base to Bring Transparency to Making Movies,"PKT is a decentralized media network on Base co-founded by the producer of the blockbuster Oblivion.  PKT aims to be a decentralized version of Roku or Apple TV.  PKT, a decentralized media network built by three brothers frustrated with Hollywood’s film business, is becoming one of the first DePIN projects to launch on Base, Coinbase’s layer-2 blockchain built on Ethereum.  Jesse Berger, one of PKT's founding community members and the producer of Hollywood blockbuster Oblivion and other million-dollar movie productions, said he had been looking for a way to bring more transparency to movie production.  Although many of his movies were wildly successful and watched by millions of people worldwide, he had no transparency into the revenue flow and how much money he was owed as a producer, he told CoinDesk in an interview. That’s when he realized blockchain could be the solution.  “I became enamored with blockchain on the basis of an immutable ledger so that you could see every transaction transparently and the idea of smart contracts to do programmatic money,” he said.  The network, which aims to be a decentralized version of Roku or Apple TV, started in 2019 on its own proof-of-work, layer-1 blockchain. Its first streaming platform, BIA, a hub for TV and films, will enter operation later this year.  “I think that the missing piece of anybody who's tried to attack the film industry to solve that problem has always been the aligned incentives of the audience, where they're part of this picture, and it's not just pay us over them,” said Josh Berger, another founding community member.  Jesse Berger also said it's important for PKT to be accessible to the average retail consumer who knows little – and doesn't care to know – about crypto. Terms that can be useful to evangelize the project to stakeholders in the crypto industry, will make eyes glaze over elsewhere.  “If we’re talking about the word 'DePIN' to a general population, I think we’ve lost to the game,"" he said. ""That terminology is really relevant within the understanding of the crypto sphere and how we have to communicate with the crypto folks, but in reality if we're gonna win as a platform, we can't talk about any of that. That's not really gong to be relevant to the average consumer. If you’re talking about how it works, you’ve lost your audience.”  One thing that PKT's crypto stakeholders will care about is the decision to use Base because PKT will be one of the first DePIN projects on the platform.  The move has several reasons, including the introduction of a stake-to-earn protocol that allows users to earn daily and long-term staking rewards and yields.  “We’ve always been focused on making this very user-friendly and adoptable and we wanted to be kind of a big fish in a small pond over at Base, and I really believe in Coinbase’s mission in what they’re trying to accomplish as a platform and lowering the barrier to entry to participate,” Jesse Berger said.  Collectively, DePIN has a market cap of $18.3 billion, according to CoinGecko data, with around $5.5 billion of that on Solana. Base has less than $5 million.  Another advantage of using Base, the team said in a release, is the technology upgrade that introduces smart contracts and Web3 features. Those simplify scaling and eliminate the need for maintaining an energy-intensive proof-of-work blockchain.  PKT will distribute a 1:1 airdrop of its tokens on Base in three phases: During Wednesday's launch, Feb. 21, 2025 and Aug. 21, 2025.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | AIRDROP,"Helene Braun, Sam Reynolds",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/08/21/depin-media-network-ptk-starts-up-on-coinbases-base,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8fe8f5be6848388458c5d6a6df1ea66577093c8b-4650x2616.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to the latest revisions by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. added 818,000 less jobs than previously thought for the period from March 2023 to March 2024. That means jobs growth for that one year period of 2.1 million versus prior reports of 2.9 million, or average monthly growth of 174,000 against the previous 242,000.  A very top level interpretation of the data: a weaker than thought economy leads to easier than expected Federal Reserve monetary policy leads to higher than otherwise bitcoin prices.  The devil, of course, is in the details, and Goldman Sachs – anticipating the sizable downward adjustment – earlier this week explained why the revisions themselves were as likely as the originally reported numbers to be erroneous. The true monthly pace of jobs growth, according to the bank, is likely to have been 200,000-240,000, a perfectly acceptable number in a growing economy.  Bitcoin briefly knee-jerked higher by about 1% to as much as $60,000 as the data hit the tape, but quickly reversed, resuming its flat-to-downward price action of the past weeks.

42417378,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYGvF,1724251200,"Crypto Airdrops Ban U.S. Users, but Americans Are Claiming Tokens Anyway","Out of an abundance of legal caution, many cryptocurrency projects exclude U.S. residents from token airdrops.  U.S. crypto users – even insiders at similarly cautious projects - regularly find ways to claim tokens anyway.  This ""hypocritical"" behavior may undermine the effort by some in the industry to avoid U.S. jurisdiction, lawyers said.  The U.S. presents a paradox to some cryptocurrency startups.  They can't afford to ignore the tech-savvy American workforce. They also can't let their brand-new crypto tokens run afoul of the world's toughest financial regulatory regime.  EigenLayer, one of Ethereum's hottest projects, embraced a solution common in crypto: it employed U.S. developers through a U.S. company. Meanwhile, a separate legal entity issued its EIGEN token from an island where U.S. securities and tax laws don't apply.  Two projects in EigenLayer's realm, Renzo and Ether.Fi, went even further: they explicitly barred U.S. residents from claiming tokens in their respective airdrops.  Apparently, It didn't work.  Wallets with links to at least 10 U.S. employees of Eigen Labs – engineers, directors, a c-suite executive, the chief lawyer – claimed hundreds of thousands of dollars-worth of free money from Renzo and Ether.Fi, according to a CoinDesk analysis of blockchain data.  CoinDesk generally does not report on individuals' personal finances. But many Eigen Labs employees chose to claim their crypto ""out in public,"" according to a blog post that detailed the company's discontinued efforts to help EigenLayer ecosystem projects airdrop tokens to Eigen Labs staff.  Furthermore, their on-chain activity suggests an attitude of selective compliance that crypto insiders said pervades the industry.  ""It's hypocrisy,"" said one U.S.-based founder of multiple crypto startups. ""But it's driven by risk alignment – you're minimally at risk when receiving an airdrop. If it's you in the hot seat, different story.""  An open secret  Few crypto teams believe the tokens associated with their inventions should be classified as securities. Still, fear of U.S regulators prompts most to distribute their brand-new (and often valuable) crypto-assets under terms that theoretically block out Americans.  The theory may be closer to a farce.  Over a dozen U.S.-based industry insiders who spoke on condition of anonymity said they have found ways to sidestep other projects’ safeguards in order to collect off-limits airdrops.  Ignoring, bypassing, and flouting geoblocks is widespread in the American crypto scene, they said.  One U.S.-based industry lawyer privately said he had previously claimed tokens from projects that had tried to protect their airdrops with geofencing.  Messy compliance practices are ""an unfortunate but predictable result of the lack of regulatory clarity the industry has been dealing with for years,"" this lawyer said.  Risk-reward  Given the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission’ years-long crackdown on the industry, most teams minting their own money would rather not draw attention to their airdrops.  Projects try to avoid releasing their tokens into regulatory hazards. They bar U.S. claimants with restrictive terms-of-service agreements. They set up geofences that catch web traffic coming from the U.S.  Seldom do projects conduct stringent know-your-customer (KYC) identity checks when distributing new tokens, as banks and other financial institutions are required to do when opening accounts.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, the weaker safeguards don't work too well.  Geofences ""cover your ass,"" said one U.S. executive at a startup that issued tokens in a restricted airdrop via an off-shore entity – and who privately acknowledged using VPNs to claim off-limits airdrops from other projects.  Terms of service agreements are an even weaker deterrent. EigenLayer's airdrop barred people who tried to claim EIGEN from within ""prohibited jurisdictions"" such as the U.S. and Canada, as well as anyone using a VPN.  Sundel, a pseudonymous EigenLayer user who claimed his EIGEN tokens in Canada, called EigenLayer's geoblock a ""silly"" protection against the SEC's ""overreach.""  Undeterred by EigenLayer's legalese, Sundel said he got his tokens with the help of a VPN and some web code configurations.  One former employee of a well-known crypto company said the jurisdiction-avoidance tactics were ""just posturing"" for potential regulatory investigations. A European crypto consultant claimed companies deliberately set weak restrictions.  ""Banning U.S. users is always purely a legal protection. But you want and need U.S. users. You want U.S users to have the easiest possible way of getting"" airdrops, the consultant said.  U.S. crypto employees' own admission to CoinDesk that they commonly flout geoblocks may be indicative of what multiple people called a ""wink, wink, nod, nod"" attitude.  ""If you know that people are knowingly violating the terms and conditions and you know that people are lying about not being in the U.S., that's not going to help"" if the regulators ever come knocking, said attorney Dan McAvoy, a co-chair of the Blockchain+ practice for Polsinelli PC.  Offshore tokens  EigenLayer's developer, Eigen Labs, is headquartered in Seattle, a city suffused with software developers. Eigen Foundation, the entity that ran EigenLayer's airdrop, is setting up office space in the Cayman Islands, whose friendly laws attract many crypto companies.  Right down the hall (literally) from the foundation's future digs is Ether.Fi, one of the biggest restaking projects on EigenLayer. Its CEO, Canadian expat Mike Silagadze, moved to the Caymans to start Ether.Fi after his home country's regulations pushed him out, according to Canadian tech news site Betakit.  When Ether.Fi launched its new crypto in March, it allocated lucrative chunks of ETHFI token to each employee of Eigen Labs. The project had previously asked Eigen Labs for a list of its employees' crypto wallets, Silagadze said.  Read more: Top Crypto Startup Drove Other Projects' Airdrops to Its Employees  ""We just got a list of 50 addresses, there [were] no names attached to them so we didn't know who it was going to,"" Silagadze said. (Eigen Labs confirmed it sent a list of all employees' wallets to projects interested in airdropping them tokens).  In a follow-up interview he stated: ""We block U.S. persons via geofencing, blocking VPNs and terms of service.""  Bullish, the parent company of CoinDesk, is an investor in Ether.Fi.  Another EigenLayer ecosystem restaking project, Renzo, in April issued its token via offshore entities, and also geoblocked U.S. web traffic. ""Our Terms of Service clearly state that US persons are not permitted to claim tokens,"" said Kratik Lodha, a representative for the token's issuer, the RestakeX Foundation.  Dozens of wallets tied to Eigen Labs employees claimed valuable airdrops from Ether.Fi and Renzo, according to blockchain data.  ""Token airdrops claimed by Eigen Labs employees are subject to the same rigorous restrictions and verification processes as any other participant,"" Lodha said.  Onshore treasure  Despite Renzo's and Ether.Fi's stated efforts to ban claims by U.S. residents, their airdrops to employees of Eigen Labs may complicate matters: Most of the company's staff appears to live in the U.S.  Well over half of Eigen Labs' workforce during the airdrop period currently live in U.S. cities such as Austin, San Francisco and Seattle, according to a review of their LinkedIn profiles.  To understand if U.S. residents claimed off-limits airdrops, CoinDesk examined transaction records on the Ethereum blockchain. We compiled a list of all Eigen Labs employees. Then, we searched for crypto wallets with Ethereum Name Service (ENS)nicknames that resembled their names. We narrowed the list down to wallets that claimed at least one of the airdrops. Our final list of nearly a dozen wallets includes only those with apparent links to Eigen Labs staff members who claim to live in the U.S.  CoinDesk has opted not to publicize individual employees' names. We are including just enough details so readers who want to can replicate our findings. None of the employees alluded to in this story responded to requests for comment.  A wallet tied to Eigen Labs' general counsel is a notable apparent claimant of the Ether.Fi airdrop.  In January 2022, the company's future chief lawyer tweeted an ENS nickname. Eleven months later, the wallet that controlled this nickname transferred the ENS to another wallet.  On May 27 of this year, the second wallet claimed 10,490.9 ETHFI (then worth $52,000) from Ether.Fi. (The 2022 tweet with the ENS nickname was deleted hours after CoinDesk asked the general counsel for comment. We archived the tweet beforehand.)  Eigen Labs' director of developer relations once disclosed his ENS on social media. A wallet bearing that ENS name claimed 10,490.9 ETHFI (then worth $33,000) on March 18 and claimed 66,667 REZ (then worth $12,000) on May 3.  On April 12, a wallet whose ENS matches the name of Eigen Labs' chief operating officer claimed 10,490.9 ETHFI (then worth over $53,000) from Ether.Fi.  Other wallets tied to Eigen Foundation's chief strategy officer, Eigen Labs' director of protocol development and a number of engineers collected hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of tokens combined from Ether.fi and Renzo. All of them are U.S. residents according to their respective LinkedIn profiles.  Legal review  How the Ether.Fi and Renzo allocations may intersect with U.S. securities law remains hypothetical. No regulator has accused the projects, Eigen Labs or its employees of wrongdoing.  ""All the lawyers have been advising everyone to follow securities laws, even the projects that are saying it's not a security"" when issuing tokens, said an industry source who follows compliance trends.  Renzo’s RestakeX Foundation said it sought to prevent claims by U.S. persons in order to remain ""in full compliance with U.S. securities laws, including Regulation S.""  Regulation S allows issuers to sell securities without registration provided the buyers are not U.S. people.  It may be harder for projects to claim securities exemptions if they knew their airdrops were going to employees of a U.S. company, said two industry lawyers who spoke on condition of anonymity.  Generally speaking, crypto insiders' self-described disregard for geoblocks could complicate their protocols' attempts to avoid U.S. jurisdiction, a third lawyer said.  Quick buck  That Eigen Labs would help its U.S. employees gain access to restricted airdrops comes with more than a pinch of irony. EigenLayer made it difficult for the populations of entire countries to claim its airdrop, even after the protocol readily accepted their deposits.  Eigen Labs did not return multiple requests for comment.  ""Working for a company that geoblocks U.S. persons from receiving airdrops while receiving airdrops from other companies certainly calls into question the strength of the belief in the purpose of geoblocking in the first place,"" one industry lawyer said.  In the wake of the airdrops, Eigen Labs said it imposed ""standardized blackout periods after airdrops,"" in other words a ban on employees selling their claimed assets for a certain time. Eigen Labs did not say when this policy came into effect.  The wallet tied to Eigen Labs' general counsel claimed its Ether.Fi airdrop on May 27 at 9:46 P.M. Seattle time, according to public blockchain data.  Eighteen minutes later, this wallet had already sold more than half its ETHFI for at least $21,000 in profit.

32679087,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=636882,1724250649,"Market Eyes 85% Increase In MATIC Price After $13 Million Transaction, Upgrade","Polygon (MATIC) is setting up perhaps for a significant surge. MATIC currently trades 13% below its projected value for the next month; the crypto space is abuzz over this undervaluation. Investors view such a slide as a good buying opportunity. Related Reading: End Of The Slump? Floki Eyes A 46% Price Surge — Analyst With a possible increase of 470% in just the next three months, the short-term predictions should be fairly optimistic. If everything goes as planned, MATIC could turn out to be one of the best performing tokens. With its next big upgrade slated to go live on September 4, 2024, Polygon is building up a sense of excitement. This upgrade will see the network shift from the MATIC to the POL coins and is highly speculated to improve Polygon in terms of functionality and governance. 🚨 30,000,000 #MATIC (13,106,053 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Binancehttps://t.co/RDx9s4PoF8 — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) August 20, 2024 $13 Million MATIC Transfer To Binance Recently, some $13 million in MATIC coins have been moved from an unknown wallet to Binance in a notable volume. This is a transfer that has stirred speculations around impending market movements and has been detected by blockchain analytics firm Whale Alert. With the upcoming upgrade of the Polygon network to POL tokens, some feel this may be foreshadowing a looming price explosion. Others, however, have said big changes such as these could set the stage for a market turmoil. Switching to POL tokens should be Polygon’s first order of business. One goal is to make POL an even more versatile and scalable digital currency than MATIC by limiting its supply to 10 billion and regulating its emission rate to only 1% per year for the next decade. The new coin is designed to be used for staking, gas costs, ease of operations, and a rise in general efficiency on the Polygon network. This brings the evolution to a major turning point, with smart contracts for POL now on the Ethereum mainnet. Although the MATIC token was expected to start its migration soon, it has remained under price pressure, moving in the tight range of $0.38 to $0.42 with little room for the upside. However, according to technical analysis, a falling wedge pattern, normally an indication of a bullish reversal, has been in play since the beginning of 2024, which suggests that MATIC could be closer to breakout level. If MATIC succeeded in breaking upwards through the upper trendline of the inverse head and shoulders pattern, it would stand to realize a massive price increase to as high as $0.85. This represents an 85% gain from its present price of around $0.44. Long-Term MATIC Projections The long-term picture looks much brighter for MATIC. The price of the token within six months should appreciate by 270%. This very gradual gain could be a trust factor for the investors in the long-term strategy of Polygon’s ecosystem growth and new partnerships. The one-year MATIC projection is even more bullish, with price increase forecasts of 480%. Assuming these predictions come to fruition, MATIC would smash all previous all-time highs, which would further cement its place in these cryptocurrencies.

MPEPE is gaining momentum and offering both fun and financial potential to investors. It is hailed as Dogecoin (DOGE)’s newest rival and could significantly impact the future of memecoins. Dogecoin (DOGE)’s Legacy: The King of Memecoins Dogecoin (DOGE) has earned its place as the king of memecoins, originally launched as a joke in 2013. Over the years, DOGE has grown from a playful internet experiment into a serious cryptocurrency asset, thanks to its viral appeal, strong community, and high-profile endorsements. Its meteoric rise in 2021, driven by social media buzz and celebrity support, showcased the power of community-driven projects in the crypto space. Despite its success, Dogecoin (DOGE) has remained relatively simple in its offerings, primarily relying on market sentiment and the strength of its community to drive value. While this approach has worked well for DOGE, the evolving cryptocurrency landscape is now seeing the rise of memecoins that offer more than just a fun brand, tokens like Mpeppe (MPEPE) that combine entertainment with tangible financial utility. Introducing Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Gambling Memecoin Set to Take Off Mpeppe (MPEPE) is not just another memecoin; it represents the next evolution of the genre by integrating the excitement of gambling with the viral appeal of memes. Inspired by the legendary Pepecoin and leveraging the growing popularity of online gambling, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is creating a platform where users can engage in sports betting and other gambling-related activities, all while enjoying the fun and community-driven aspects of memecoins. What sets Mpeppe (MPEPE) apart from traditional memecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) is its focus on real financial utility. By incorporating decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, Mpeppe (MPEPE) allows users to access financial services such as lending, borrowing, and trading, providing them with multiple avenues to generate income. This blend of entertainment and financial functionality makes Mpeppe (MPEPE) a unique and compelling investment option in the current crypto market. Why Mpeppe (MPEPE) Could Rival Dogecoin (DOGE) Several factors suggest that Mpeppe (MPEPE) could soon rival Dogecoin (DOGE) in popularity and market value. First and foremost is Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s innovative approach to combining meme culture with the booming online gambling industry. The global gambling market is worth billions, and Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s integration of blockchain technology into this space positions it well to attract a large and diverse user base. As more users join the platform, the demand for Mpeppe (MPEPE) tokens is likely to increase, driving up the token’s value and creating the conditions for a significant price rally. Mpeppe (MPEPE), a low-entry cryptocurrency, offers investors a chance to capitalize on the cryptocurrency market’s growth. Early Dogecoin (DOGE) investors saw significant returns, and Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s focus on decentralized finance provides a unique utility. Participating in DeFi activities like yield farming and liquidity mining offers additional returns on investments. For Dogecoin (DOGE) holders accustomed to market volatility, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s steady, long-term gains make it a compelling investment option. Conclusion: Mpeppe (MPEPE) – The Next Big Rival to Dogecoin (DOGE) Mpeppe (MPEPE) is a rising cryptocurrency market player, offering a unique blend of meme culture, gambling, and decentralized finance. Despite being positioned to rival Dogecoin (DOGE), Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s innovative approach and potential for significant gains are attracting investors. As Mpeppe (MPEPE) gains traction, its value is expected to rise, creating a lucrative opportunity for early investors.

32676033,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=636986,1724245235,The Future Is Bright For These Two ICOs as They Are Both Predicted To 1000x PEPU & MPEPE,"In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, where trends can shift in the blink of an eye, two Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) are catching the attention of investors for their massive potential. Pepe Unchained (PEPU) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are not just another set of meme coins; they are technological marvels that are set to redefine the meme coin space. With strong community support and innovative approaches, both PEPU and MPEPE are poised for a significant breakout, with predictions suggesting they could 1000x in value. The Rise of Pepe Unchained: A Meme Coin with Substance Pepe Unchained (PEPU) has rapidly gained traction in the crypto community, breaking through the $9.6 million mark in its presale phase. This impressive feat is a testament to the strong belief in the project’s potential. Unlike traditional meme coins, Pepe Unchained (PEPU) is built on a solid foundation of technological innovation. The project’s Layer-2 blockchain solution, designed to address the high transaction costs and slow speeds associated with Ethereum, has been a key driver of its success. In recent weeks, the broader meme coin market has experienced significant volatility. Leading meme coins such as Dogewhifhat and Brett have seen substantial declines, with losses of 25% and 21% respectively over the last seven days. Even the well-known Pepecoin (PEPE) hasn’t been spared, recording a 14% drop in the same period. However, in stark contrast, Pepe Unchained (PEPU) has continued to surge, adding over a million dollars in value in just a week. This resilience has further solidified its position as a promising investment. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Rising Star While Pepe Unchained (PEPU) has been making headlines, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quietly becoming a force to be reckoned with. Currently priced at $0.001777, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is in the early stages of its ICO, offering investors a unique opportunity to get in on the ground floor. With its smart contract address at 0xd328a1C97e9b6b3Afd42eAf535bcB55A85cDcA7B, MPEPE is designed to build on the successes and lessons learned from its predecessors, positioning itself as a meme coin with real-world utility and potential for massive gains. The appeal of Mpeppe (MPEPE) lies in its commitment to community-driven development and its focus on delivering value beyond mere speculation. As more investors recognize the potential of MPEPE, the coin is expected to see substantial growth, making it an attractive option for those looking to diversify their portfolios. Why PEPU and MPEPE Are Poised to 1000x The potential for both PEPU and MPEPE to 1000x is rooted in several key factors: Technological Innovation: Both ICOs are leveraging cutting-edge technology to solve real problems in the crypto space. PEPU’s Layer-2 blockchain solution addresses the inefficiencies of Ethereum, while MPEPE focuses on creating a robust ecosystem that adds value to its community. Strong Community Support: The success of any cryptocurrency largely depends on its community. Pepe Unchained (PEPU) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) have both cultivated strong followings, with investors and supporters who are deeply committed to the projects. This community-driven approach is crucial for long-term success. Market Timing: The broader crypto market is currently in a consolidation phase, with many coins experiencing significant losses. However, this period of uncertainty presents an opportunity for projects like Pepe Unchained (PEPU) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) to shine. As the market stabilizes, these coins are well-positioned to capitalize on renewed investor interest. The Road Ahead: What to Expect As Pepe Unchained (PEPU) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) continue to gain momentum, the future looks incredibly bright for both projects. Pepe Unchained is expected to hit the $10 million mark in its presale within days, setting the stage for a significant price surge once it hits exchanges. Similarly, Mpeppe’s early success suggests that it could follow in PEPU’s footsteps, delivering substantial returns for early investors. For those looking to secure financial wealth in the crypto space, Pepe Unchained (PEPU) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) offer compelling opportunities. With predictions of 1000x gains, these ICOs are not just about short-term profits; they represent long-term investments in projects that have the potential to redefine the meme coin landscape. Conclusion: Seize the Opportunity The crypto market is constantly evolving, and those who are quick to recognize and seize opportunities often reap the greatest rewards. Pepe Unchained (PEPU) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are two ICOs that stand out in a crowded market, offering innovative solutions and strong community support. As these projects continue to develop, their potential for growth is undeniable.

32676030,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=636865,1724245233,XRP Alert: Raoul Pal Advises Investors To Sell Now – Here’s Why,"A new video by macro guru Raoul Pal is currently causing quite a stir in the XRP community. In the recently published video update, Pal, the co-founder and CEO of Real Vision, says that investors should avoid older coins like XRP and ADA. His analysis presents a sobering outlook for these longstanding members of the crypto ecosystem, arguing that they may no longer be at the forefront of blockchain innovation. Sell XRP Now? During his discourse, Pal critiqued the capacity for innovation and adaptation in projects like XRP and ADA, which have been market fixtures but, in his view, now lack the dynamism seen in newer blockchain ventures. He posited that these older coins are being overshadowed by newer, more agile entrants that promise greater technological advancements and potential returns. “XRP, we’ve gone through this before you might be right, you might love it, forever just please move to whatever the strong momentum is,” Pal urged. This statement encapsulates his broader message: that nostalgia or loyalty to a particular crypto asset could hinder investors from capitalizing on emerging opportunities. A central theme of Pal’s commentary was the cult-like communities that have formed around certain cryptocurrencies. He argues that these communities often foster an emotional attachment that can cloud judgment and investment decisions.

I beg you don’t do this and the communities are huge and I feel like and I don’t want to get attacked by people online for this but I just feel like you’re being done a disservice by being a cult,” Pal stated. By using the term “mercenaries,” Pal emphasized the importance of being profit-driven rather than emotionally driven in investment decisions. He suggested that investors should be ready to deploy their capital wherever the best risk-adjusted returns can be found, rather than sticking with investments out of loyalty or hope. “I feel like you’re being done a disservice by being a cult. Our job is to be mercenaries. We’re in the job to make money not to be a cult. Cults don’t make money except for the leaders. Be a mercenary, lend out your capital to the opportunities that will offer you the best risk adjusted return,” he explained.

I really hope you’re right but hope is not an investment strategy. Okay, so I’m not trying to insult you. I’m not trying to be rude. Please just understand my heart is coming from a good place. I’m trying to help you all.” XRP Community Reactions The reactions to Pal’s comments were mixed, with significant pushback coming from prominent members within the XRP community. Fred Rispoli, a pro-XRP lawyer, responded with measured disagreement: “I thoroughly enjoy Raoul Pal and, until shown otherwise, consider him authentic and well-meaning. I respectfully disagree with him on XRP but that thesis is reasonable and has not been proven wrong…yet. I do agree there exist ‘old’ coins (cough, EOS) whose days are long past.” Bill Morgan, another pro-XRP lawyer, critiqued Pal’s arguments for lacking depth and specificity: “His comments may have more value if he gave even one cogent reason why people should not hold XRP other than indirectly referring to its age. If that is his only criteria then he might as well add Bitcoin and Ethereum to Cardano and XRP as they also are old.” Yassin Mobarak of Dizer Capital highlighted the high-risk, high-reward nature of XRP: “XRP is the kind of crypto you don’t want to be caught not being in it when it skyrockets. Until then it’s painful, boring and utterly demoralizing to hold.” At press time, XRP traded at $0.5982.

32676028,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=636957,1724245208,Ethereum (ETH) Gas Fee’s Drop As Investors Purchase new Memecoin at $0.001777,"The cryptocurrency market is always abuzz with new developments, and the latest buzz revolves around the sudden drop in Ethereum (ETH) gas fees, coinciding with a surge in interest in a new memecoin, Mpeppe (MPEPE). Priced at an accessible $0.001777, Mpeppe has quickly attracted the attention of investors eager to capitalize on its potential. As more investors flock to purchase this new memecoin, Ethereum (ETH)’s network is experiencing a noticeable drop in gas fees. Here’s a closer look at what’s happening and why Mpeppe is becoming the new hot ticket in the crypto world. Ethereum (ETH) Gas Fees Take a Dip Amid Mpeppe (MPEPE) Surge Ethereum (ETH) gas fees, often a point of contention for investors and developers alike, have seen a noticeable decrease recently. This drop in fees is largely attributed to the rising popularity of Mpeppe (MPEPE), a new memecoin that has quickly gained traction in the market. As investors shift their focus to purchasing Mpeppe (MPEPE), the demand for Ethereum (ETH) transactions has led to a more efficient use of the network, resulting in lower gas fees. The drop in gas fees is a welcome change for many in the Ethereum (ETH) community, as high fees have often been a barrier to entry for smaller investors. With Mpeppe (MPEPE) priced at just $0.001777, more investors can afford to participate in the market, further driving the token’s popularity and contributing to the overall reduction in transaction costs on the Ethereum (ETH) network. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The New Memecoin Taking the Market by Storm Mpeppe (MPEPE) is not just another memecoin; it represents a new wave of innovation in the cryptocurrency space. Priced at an attractive $0.001777, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has quickly caught the eye of investors looking for the next big opportunity. Inspired by the legendary Pepecoin and the global appeal of sports fandom, Mpeppe aims to unite crypto enthusiasts through the power of blockchain and meme culture. One of the key factors driving the surge in Mpeppe (MPEPE) purchases is its unique positioning in the market. Mpeppe (MPEPE) combines the viral nature of internet memes with the robust functionality of blockchain technology, creating a token that is both entertaining and potentially profitable. Investors are drawn to Mpeppe (MPEPE) not only for its low entry price but also for its promise of substantial returns as the token gains traction. The Impact of Mpeppe (MPEPE) on Ethereum (ETH)’s Ecosystem The rise in Mpeppe (MPEPE) purchases is significantly affecting Ethereum (ETH)’s ecosystem, particularly in terms of gas fees. This has led to increased transaction volume, resulting in more efficient resource use and lower gas fees, making transactions cheaper for users. This is beneficial for Ethereum (ETH) holders, as it reduces the cost of participating and encourages more activity. Similarly, Mpeppe (MPEPE) investors benefit from lower fees, making it easier to buy and trade the token, further fueling its growth. Conclusion: Mpeppe (MPEPE) – A New Opportunity in the Crypto Market Mpeppe (MPEPE) is transforming the crypto community and reducing gas fees on the Ethereum (ETH) network. Its low entry price, innovative approach, and high returns make it a favorite among investors. As the market evolves, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is positioning itself as a key player in the next generation of memecoins, offering lower transaction costs on Ethereum (ETH).

42417408,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYIjl,1724245200,Controversial Crypto Firm Prometheum to Treat Uniswap and Arbitrum's Tokens as Securities,"Registered securities firm Prometheum intends to take custody of customers' UNI and ARB as securities when it gets rolling, adding them to its existing plans for Ethereum's ether.  While the crypto industry fights the Securities and Exchange Commission's stance on tokens as securities, Prometheum is still seeking a road to comply with the agency's view.  The company intends to open its custodial doors in earnest in September.  Prometheum is forging ahead with its strategy to comply with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's view on cryptocurrency transactions by letting two more tokens into its custody operation for crypto securities, whether the rest of the industry agrees or not.  The U.S. firm's custodial business will accept tokens issued by Uniswap {{UNI}} and Arbitrum {{ARB}} in addition to its earlier announcement it would custody Etherium's ether {{ETH}}, company officials told CoinDesk. Treating these tokens as securities is meant to put Prometheum in line with what the SEC insists is the law for U.S. digital assets transactions: that the vast majority of tokens should be treated as securities under the agency's jurisdiction.  ""Prometheum Capital views the federal securities laws as the regulatory framework that provides established, tried, and tested investor protections,"" said Benjamin Kaplan, CEO of subsidiary Prometheum Capital, in an emailed response to questions. ""Providing a regulated mechanism to allow investors to responsibly participate in the digital asset space has always been our goal.""  As the firm moves toward fully opening its doors to institutional customers by the end of next month, according to its own estimate, much of the industry is battling the SEC in federal courts. Some of the most prominent U.S. crypto firms are arguing (with occasional success) that digital assets shouldn't necessarily be treated as investment contracts that count as securities. Bitcoin {{BTC}} is well-established as a commodity, for instance, which leaves it outside the SEC's reach.  Prometheum is a unique creature in the industry, because it's the first and only company to set up formally as a special-purpose broker-dealer for crypto assets. It's registered as a custodian and to clear and settle digital asset trades. Company officials' past predictions for when it would become a one-stop shop for crypto transactions have proven overly optimistic, and Kaplan is now only willing to say that'll happen sometime ""after the full launch of its custodial offering.""  The company's stance that the SEC is correct puts it at odds with most of its counterparts in the sector. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has more than once referred to the company as a potential example of crypto done correctly. So far, the regulator hasn't openly pushed back on Prometheum's business model, but the firm has only proceeded to date with a ""soft launch"" in May, though Kaplan wouldn't offer details about what that meant and whether the company is earning revenue.  He also declined to say whether the company has received any reinforcement from the SEC about its business model, only that it engages with the regulator ""in the normal course of business.""  If institutional customers do knock on its door later this year, the company contends that the type of blockchain-backed custody it's offering is more transparent and saves the costs of intermediaries, such as transfer agents.  Its earlier announcement about custodying ETH for clients raised questions among some of the company's critics, and Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Rostin Behnam acknowledged in a congressional hearing that a securities firm handling ETH could run afoul of his agency's decision to treat that token as a commodity.  The SEC has signaled that UNI may be a security, as well, when it threatened an enforcement action. Uniswap Labs contends the arguments for UNI being a security are unfounded.  ""The SEC’s aggressive theories are an effort to expand its jurisdiction beyond exchanges to communications technology – and beyond securities to all markets. Their legal arguments are weak and have been refuted by courts,"" the Uniswap Labs argued in a May blog post.  ARB is the native token of the Arbitrum network, billed as a faster and cheaper blockchain for transacting on Ethereum.  When asked why Prometheum selected UNI and ARB, Kaplan responded, ""Prometheum Capital intends to provide investors access to the top digital assets over time, as well as tokenized assets, debt, equities, [exchange traded funds], mutual funds, options, money market funds and other investment contract products that are issued and transferred on a blockchain.""

Ethereum ETFs as a whole have seen cumulative net outflows of over $440 million, underperforming compared to bitcoin ETFs, with BlackRock's bitcoin fund even ranking among the top five ETFs for 2024 inflows.  BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), its spot ether exchange-traded fund (ETF), on Tuesday became the first among a cohort of 11 issuers to cross the landmark $1 billion in net inflows, data shows.  ETHA holds over $860 million in net assets, surpassed only by Grayscale’s mini ether trust (ETH) and Ethereum trust (ETHE).  ETHA’s net inflows are more than the next three highest ETF inflows combined, SoSoValue data shows. Fidelity’s FETH has taken on a total of $367 million since the funds went live July 23, Bitwise’s ETHW has taken $310 million and Grayscale’s ETH has taken on $227 million.  Other ETFs have recorded less than $60 million in net inflows, the data shows. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s ETHE – converted from an institutional-only trust product – has been the biggest loser, with $2.7 billion in net outflows since going live.  The various ETFs have underperformed their bitcoin counterparts with over $440 million in cumulative net outflows. In comparison, the first month of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds saw daily net inflows of about $125 million, as reported, accumulating over $11 billion worth of bitcoin (minus outflows from the Grayscale’s trust-converted GBTC).  BlackRock’s bitcoin fund even made it in the top five of all ETFs, even non-crypto ones, based on 2024 inflows, putting it on similar levels with industry-leading indexing giants like the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO).",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/08/21/blackrocks-etha-becomes-first-ethereum-etf-to-cross-1b-in-net-inflows,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a5c08dc9387d1092dc49e57a74c1093c66d43773-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Crypto markets have shown less volatility driving lighter trading volumes, while institutional trading and larger coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum (where Coinbase makes thinner spreads) are gaining share. The company continues to face ongoing uncertainty from a pending SEC lawsuit and regulatory uncertainty. Despite the recent fall, Coinbase remains a sell. After sharp losses in late July and early August, the fear in the markets has gradually cooled and volatility has eased. The same is true for the crypto markets, as Bitcoin has continued to vigorously defend a price in the ~$60k range. Lower volatility in the crypto markets, meanwhile, has hurt trading revenues at Coinbase ( COIN ), one of the largest and best-known cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges. The company recently reported Q2 results that showed a substantial sequential slowdown on lower trading volumes, bringing the stock down ~25% from YTD peaks. Still, Coinbase continues to slightly outperform the broader market with a low-20s percentage gain for the year: Data by YCharts I last wrote a bearish note on Coinbase in June , when the stock was trading closer to the $250 mark. Since then, Coinbase has sunk more than 20%, but that has also been accompanied by both slower trading volumes and amid sharper competition from generalist brokers like Robinhood ( HOOD ). With this in mind, while I'm slightly more sanguine on Coinbase's prospects following its recent correction, I'm still bearish on this stock for the long term. Here are the major risks for investors to be aware of for Coinbase: More than half of the company's revenue is derived from very volatile trading activity. Though the company has more stable revenue streams coming from both subscriptions and blockchain mining rewards, more than half of its revenue is derived from trading, which varies widely from quarter to quarter. Most of Coinbase's trading revenue is derived from smaller altcoins. Moreover, not only does Coinbase rely on trading for its revenue, but the most lucrative spreads come from smaller coins, on which Coinbase benefits from larger bid-ask spreads. I'm of the belief that the crypto market will eventually converge to a few top coins, on which Coinbase makes a lower spread. Competition. ETFs themselves may prove to be a competitive driver versus Coinbase, as more inflows flow in through ""regular"" stock market exchanges and take trading volume away from coins themselves. Ongoing SEC lawsuit and regulatory uncertainty. Since mid last year, Coinbase has been embroiled in a lawsuit from the SEC , which alleged that Coinbase engages in the sale of unregistered securities. The suit is currently in the discovery phase and is expected to take time to settle. The uncertainties stemming from this suit - and in general, over the future course of regulation for the cryptocurrency industry as a whole - remains a big question mark for Coinbase. We should also acknowledge that Coinbase, in spite of its recent fall, remains quite expensive. At current share prices just under $200, the company trades at a market cap of $48.42 billion. After we net off the $8.28 billion of cash and USDC (a stable coin backed by the U.S. dollar) on the company's latest balance sheet against $4.22 billion of debt, Coinbase's resulting enterprise value is $44.36 billion . For next fiscal year FY25, Wall Street analysts are expecting Coinbase to generate $6.08 billion in revenue, up 5% y/y and reflecting tougher compares against heightened Q1 volatility this year and the expectation of a more stable crypto market next year. Against this revenue outlook, Coinbase already trades at a high single digit revenue multiple of 7.3x EV/FY25 revenue . Projecting forward profit for Coinbase is tough (and the company never guides to any bottom-line metrics) because trading revenue is unpredictable and different crypto assets have different spreads and margins, but on a TTM basis, the company generated $2.11 billion in adjusted EBITDA. So, against trailing earnings, Coinbase trades at 23.0x EV/TTM adjusted EBITDA - also an elevated multiple. So what we have here is a company trading at a premium, and subject to extreme volatility in both its underlying trading business, as well as uncertainties from regulation and an ongoing SEC suit. To me, these are clear signals to stay away. Q2 download Coinbase's latest Q2 results showed a slowdown in trading revenue, while Q3 is now expected to be more of the same. Take a look at the Q2 results below: Coinbase Q2 results (Coinbase Q2 shareholder letter) Coinbase's revenue grew 104% y/y to $1.45 billion, ahead of Wall Street's expectations of $1.36 billion (+92% y/y). While this sounds like a huge y/y leap, we note that total revenue declined -12% sequentially versus Q1. The main culprit is lower trading volumes. As shown below, total trading volume in Q2 declined -28% sequentially to $226 billion, versus $312 billion in Q1: driven largely by institutional volumes. Furthermore, bitcoin and Ethereum made up a 4% greater share of trading volume (combined) while other coins which generate higher spreads for Coinbase lost share. Coinbase trading metrics (Coinbase Q2 shareholder letter) The chart below, meanwhile, breaks down the revenue implications of this. Total transaction revenue declined -27% sequentially to $781 million. It's important to recognize that while institutional volumes make up nearly 85% of trading, Coinbase generates ~85% of its revenue from consumer trading, especially where dealing with smaller altcoins is more prevalent. Relative stability in the crypto markets in Q2 (amid higher average crypto market capitalization in Q2 versus Q1, per the company's Q2 shareholder letter ) brought volatility and trading volumes down. Coinbase revenue breakdown (Coinbase Q2 shareholder letter) We do note that on a revenue basis, peers are reporting similar results in Q2. Robinhood's trading revenue in Q2 of $81 million nearly tripled y/y, but also declined -36% sequentially versus Q1. Where Robinhood has net interest income for buffer, Coinbase has subscription and services revenue - which still grew both y/y and sequentially to $599 million, ahead of the company's initial guidance outlook of $525-$600 million. The company's Q3 outlook, however, continues to invoke a tone of caution. At best, subscription revenue will be flat in Q3 (a range of $530-$600 million), and while the company doesn't guide to transaction revenue, it notes that July trading revenue was $210 million, which if flat-lined across three months would be lower than the $781 million in transactional revenue that Coinbase achieved in Q2. Coinbase Q3 outlook (Coinbase Q2 shareholder letter) The company is noting that softer Ethereum prices and a coming rate cut will be detrimental to the company's results. Meanwhile, expenses are expected to increase: with technology and development plus general and administrative expenses rising to $700-$750 million, versus $684 million in Q2, and sales and marketing at a $160-$210 million range versus $165 million in Q2. So even though Coinbase doesn't guide to bottom-line results, we can infer that adjusted EBITDA (at $595.5 million in Q2, up ~3x y/y but down more than 40% sequentially versus Q1) will see a further sequential decline in Q3, if trading volumes remain lower and expenses rise. Key takeaways In my view, there's little to cheer for Coinbase as crypto volatility eases and the company faces a period of lighter trading amid higher expenses, which will eat into its adjusted EBITDA growth. And amid ongoing uncertainty over litigation and crypto regulation, I'm more inclined to steer clear of this stock, even despite its recent correction.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4716153-coinbase-still-overvalued-after-the-fall-coin-stock?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/32675600.jpeg

The broker raised its price target for the bitcoin miner to $7 from $6 while maintaining its buy rating on the stock. The shares were 1.5% higher at $4.01 in early trading on Wednesday.  Canaccord said its positive view on the stock was reinforced by strong second quarter results which included an ""outlook that contemplates strong exahash growth, a solid, unencumbered balance sheet, and by a business model that was more ready than most for the recent halving event.""  The Bitcoin network hashrate is measured in exahash per second. Hashrate refers to the total amount of combined computational power used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain.  The company's operational update underscored another quarter where Cipher was again one of the lowest-cost producers in the bitcoin mining sector, the report said.  In another positive development, the bitcoin miner plans to ""materially increase production efficiency"" at its largest facility in Odessa, Texas, in the coming quarters, by upgrading its mining fleet, Canaccord said.

Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 1,915 −1.8%  Bitcoin (BTC): $59,471 −1.9%  Ether (ETH): $2,586 −2.5%  S&P 500: 5,597.12 −0.2%  Gold: $2,547 +1.4%  Nikkei 225: 37,951.80 −0.29%  Top Stories  Bitcoin traded little changed below $60,000 during much of the Asian and European mornings. BTC had retreated from its brief rally to $61,000 on Tuesday, trading at around $59,350, a fall of nearly 2.5% over 24 hours. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to publish a data revision that some observers expect to show job growth in the year to March was slower than previously estimated. Mt. Gox-related selling pressure may also be rearing its head after a wallet associated with the defunct exchange moved $784 million worth of BTC early on Wednesday, according to data tracking platform Arkham Intelligence.  Bitcoin metrics indicate weak demand, reflecting increased selling amid weeks of muted price action. CryptoQuant's demand indicator, which tracks the difference between the daily total bitcoin block rewards and the daily change in the number of bitcoin, has not moved in a year or more. Inflows to spot bitcoin ETFs have also waned from a monthly pace of 6% in March to just 1% now, CryptoQuant has said. Still, a few metrics have remained strong. Long-term holders – or wallets that hold the for more than six months – have continued accumulating bitcoin at “unprecedented levels,” with the total balance reaching a record-high monthly rate of 391,000 BTC earlier this week.  The aggregate number of institutional investors holding bitcoin ETFs in the second quarter rose 14% from the first quarter, according to Bitwise. These investors' share of total assets under management (AUM) of bitcoin ETFs grew to 21.15% from 18.74%, Bitwise said, adding that institutions ended the quarter holding $11 billion in BTC ETFs. This took place amid a 12% slide in the price of bitcoin during the quarter. Bitwise noted criticism that bitcoin ETFs are predominantly owned by retail investors, an assertion it says is simply untrue. It observed that these ETFs have been adopted by institutions ""at the fastest rate of any ETF in history.""  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the combined market capitalization of the top two stablecoins, tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), has increased nearly 3% to a record $152 billion this month.  The increase in the so-called dry powder often breeds bullish trends in the broader market.

32674156,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=636802,1724241647,Bitcoin Sees Surge in Demand: Are We At The Final Phase of Consolidation?,"Bitcoin (BTC) has been consolidating in the past weeks as it continues to range below $61,000. Amid this period of consolidation, there now appears to be a shift with an increase in one of Bitcoin’s notable metrics suggesting a “market consolidation finale.” According to a recent analysis by CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler Jr, there has been a significant surge in BTC’s average daily token transfer volume following its recent climb to the $57,000 mark. This increase in transfer volume, which rose from $650,000 to $765,000, according to the data shared by Adler Jr, coincides with Bitcoin’s price stabilization within the $57,000-$68,000 range. Related Reading: Over 80% of Short-Term Bitcoin Holders Underwater — What This Means For BTC Final Phase Of Consolidation? According to the analyst, the rising transfer volume is particularly interesting as it reflects the behavior of market participants in response to Bitcoin’s current price levels. Despite the uptick in volume, driven in part by panic selling, Bitcoin’s price has remained resilient, indicating that the market has effectively absorbed this selling pressure. As highlighted by Adler Jr, this resilience in price amidst heightened activity suggests that the market may enter the “final phase” of consolidation, where price movements narrow and volatility decreases as market participants reach a consensus on Bitcoin’s value. Axel Adler Jr’s analysis further sheds light on a critical aspect of the current market dynamics—the demand for what was once considered “expensive” coins. 🛎️ New Quicktake: Increased demand for Bitcoin signals market consolidation finale 👇https://t.co/VCoOPYTzWg — Axel 💎🙌 Adler Jr (@AxelAdlerJr) August 20, 2024 As Bitcoin’s price stabilized within the consolidation range, the consistent transfer volume indicates that there is still strong demand for Bitcoin, even at these relatively high price levels. Adler Jr pointed out that investors view these prices as attractive entry points, eager to acquire Bitcoin at what they perceive as a “favorable valuation.” Is Bitcoin Poised for a Major Price Movement? Notably, these market participants’ behavior is crucial in understanding the current phase of Bitcoin’s market cycle. Typically, during a consolidation phase, the market experiences a reduction in volatility as buyers and sellers gradually converge on an agreed-upon price range. In this case, despite increased selling activity, the steady demand for Bitcoin at the $57,000 level suggests that the market is finding equilibrium, which could lead to a significant price movement once the consolidation phase concludes. Furthermore, the increase in token transfer volume at this stage indicates sustained interest in Bitcoin. This demand highlights a bullish outlook among many market participants who believe that Bitcoin’s current price range represents a solid foundation for future growth.

42417399,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYIaT,1724241600,'Wartime CEO': Urbit's Founder Returns in Shakeup at Moonshot Software Project,"Urbit, an idiosyncratic and audacious project to rebuild the entire internet computing stack from scratch, brought back controversial founder Curtis Yarvin after a five-year hiatus. He holds no formal title but is taking the lead on strategy.  The board of the Urbit Foundation, the nonprofit that steers core development, fired executive director Josh Lehman. Christopher Colby is filling the role on an interim basis while the board seeks a permanent replacement.  The foundation is running out of money. A fundraising proposal backed by Lehman to create a new layer-2 blockchain on top of Ethereum has been scrapped in favor of Yarvin's strategy, which involves creating a utility token, possibly on Base, Coinbase's layer-2 network.  By all accounts, Urbit has been struggling.  The Urbit Foundation, the nonprofit that steers development of the 22-year-old moonshot software project that aims to rebuild the internet from scratch, is running out of money, with a runway measurable in months. Last year saw a ""mass exodus"" of startups and developers from the decentralized ecosystem, as William Ball, one of the foundation's three board members, put it on a call with developers Thursday.  The user experience on the network remains clunky, which is part of Urbit's charm but not a sustainable situation for a project that wants to replace something with broad, mainstream appeal like the internet. The price of a star, the second-largest unit of digital real estate on the network, has fallen to a little over $1,000 from a peak of about $27,000 in late 2021, according to Dune Analytics data.  Last week, the Urbit board decided to make drastic changes.  It sacked Josh Lehman, the foundation's executive director since 2021, and replaced him, on an interim basis, with Christopher Colby, founder of a prediction market startup called Alphabet. The board also scrapped a fundraising proposal, backed by Lehman, to create a new layer-2 blockchain on top of Ethereum (using a software development kit from the Cosmos ecosystem).  Most shockingly to Urbit devotees and outsiders alike, the board welcomed back Curtis Yarvin, the project's founder, who left in 2019. Yarvin is best known for his unorthodox political writings – a bit more on those later. (Just a bit, promise.) He holds no formal position at the foundation but will take the lead on strategy, he said.  ""We don't give a [expletive] about titles,"" Yarvin, who rarely speaks to journalists, told CoinDesk in an interview. ""We're here to fix this.""  The shakeup rattled some of the Urbit community's leading lights. Several quit the foundation, including Chief Technology Officer Ted Blackman and senior software engineer Liam Fitzgerald.  Blackman emphasized that while he no longer works for the nonprofit, he plans to continue to work on Urbit, unpaid, as an open-source developer, and will start an unrelated consulting business to pay his bills.  ""The core developers of Urbit, most of them, including me, are committed to continuing to work on the operating system, no matter whether we're getting paid or not,"" Blackman told CoinDesk. ""Rumors of Urbit's death have been exaggerated.""  Fitzgerald, who expressed frustration at the haphazard way in which the board communicated the changes, sounded less enthusiastic than Blackman but wouldn't rule out continuing to work on Urbit outside the foundation. ""It's a possible direction,"" he said.  Yarvin indicated he is trying to do damage control. ""There's a bunch of ruffled feathers out there,"" he said in the interview. ""We're in the process of unruffling them.""  Nevertheless, he cautioned on Thursday's marathon, hours-long call with developers that inevitably, some proverbial eggs may have to be broken.  ""We have to fix this now,"" he told colleagues. ""That's going to reduce the ability to do it collegially.""  Late Tuesday, Ball told CoinDesk the foundation would retain 50% of its staff. ""Morale is much higher now,"" he said.  What happened to Urbit?  In an oversimplified description, Urbit is a decentralized network of ""personal servers."" Its lofty – perhaps quixotic – aim is to restore sovereignty to internet users, who have become dependent on giant, politicized platforms like Facebook and Google to host their data.  Underscoring the ambition of the endeavor, Urbit has its own programming languages (Nock and Hoon), its own operating system (called Arvo) and its own identity system (Azimuth). It is a very weird system, right down to the naming convention: this reporter's planet, or digital identity on the network, is ~fodrex-malmev. Enthusiasts have embraced its eccentricity, calling themselves ""Martians.""  At the moment, the network is mostly used for direct messaging, group chats and, well, developing Urbit. But the big idea is that eventually, everything that is done on the internet could happen on Urbit.  A veteran of Silicon Valley's high-flying dotcom era, Yarvin started working on Urbit in 2002. In 2013, he founded a company named Tlon (after a Jorge Luis Borges story) to develop the software. Yarvin left Tlon in 2019, but retained significant ownership of the namespace, or digital real estate, on the network.  By 2022, despite (or maybe in part because of) its esotericism, Urbit had attracted nontrivial investment capital, startups, developers – and buzz. The foundation had been formed to take over core development from Tlon, which shifted to product development. Writers and artists came to Assembly, the community's annual conference, to speak alongside the techies.  The vibes were beautiful. And in Yarvin's analysis, that's when the Urbit community began to stumble.  ""A lot of the flattery went to everybody's head,"" he told CoinDesk. ""We kind of wound up pretending, not only to others, but to ourselves"" that the system was more mature than it was.  Urbit had sat out the initial coin offering bonanza of 2017-2018, so it has never had a huge war chest. Nevertheless, in Yarvin's telling, the project fell into a similar trap as many cryptocurrency teams.  ""We sort of put a lot of energy into building an ecosystem, under the premise that we were ready to build an ecosystem – there's no real way to go back on that,"" Yarvin said. ""The result was a lot of dead code and a lot of disappointed people.""  Lehman, the former executive director, said one challenge was that the foundation funded core development by selling ""galaxies,"" the largest unit of address space on the network, to venture capital investors. (Galaxies are made up of stars, which in turn contain individual IDs called planets.)  ""The hard thing about being effectively venture-funded is that venture [capital] wants to see growth,"" Lehman told CoinDesk. ""As the group driving core development, we're pretty cut off from levers that drive growth. That depends on product companies, and a lot of those companies were leaving"" the ecosystem.  One such company is Kinode (formerly Uqbar), which is trying to build a similar peer-to-peer computing infrastructure with a more traditional software stack, including the Rust programming language.  ""We realized over time that the software that was Urbit was just not going to deliver,"" said Ben McCormick, a consultant at Kinode. ""A lot of other people were like, 'What if somebody made Urbit, but normal?' And so we ended up just kind of doing that.""  Yarvin was quick to praise Lehman, but said his management style was better suited to a mature organization than a fledgling endeavor that should always assume it's fighting for its life, no matter how much money it's raised.  ""Josh is an excellent peacetime CEO,"" Yarvin said. But the Urbit project is ""still a startup. We're still default-dead, and we're gonna die if we can't make this completely real. And making it completely real is absolutely the goal. … For that, you need a wartime CEO.""  Like Blackman, Lehman said he intends to continue working on Urbit.  ""A lot of people are very motivated to keep doing it,"" he said. ""I am, too.""  What's next for Urbit?  When asked how he plans to get more runway for the foundation, Yarvin answered: ""We have to have something that's investable, and we're doing that very fast. … Having a project that people love and basically fixing the tokenomics and taking them seriously is definitely going to be adequate.""  Part of his turnaround strategy is to accelerate Urbit's growth as an identity system and social network without waiting for the inevitably slower development of the operating system.  In a draft X (formerly Twitter) thread shared with CoinDesk, Yarvin suggests that Urbit identities could, in the near term, work as a decentralized single-sign-on for websites, similar to the Ethereum Name Service (ENS). A key difference is that whereas there is an infinite supply of ENS handles, and they must be renewed every few years, Urbit identities are scarce and users own rather than lease them, he argues.  Users would still have the option of using decentralized servers that run on the Arvo operating system if they want, but this would no longer be a requirement to be ""on Urbit.""  ""Urbit as a society is the people who interact as their Urbit identities,"" Yarvin said in the interview. ""Growing that society basically means attracting people into this world. It doesn't mean any specific technical thing.""  Partly to facilitate the social network's expansion, and also to repair the address space market, the foundation will make changes to Azimuth, the Ethereum smart contract that acts as the sort of county clerk for Urbit.  Azimuth started on the main Ethereum network, but this became an expensive way to track namespace ownership when gas, or on-chain computation fees, surged during the 2020-2021 crypto bull market.  To address that problem, Azimuth got its own L2, a ""naive rollup,"" in 2021. This carried its own disadvantages. A planet, or user identity, issued from the rollup layer cannot be registered on the main Ethereum chain. (Imagine signing over the deed to a house but having no way to notify the county clerk.)  Instead of Lehman's plan to create yet another Ethereum L2, Yarvin has proposed to move Azimuth to an existing one. While he said the team is making no commitments, they are leaning toward Base, the network developed by crypto exchange powerhouse Coinbase that is known for its low fees.  Wherever it ends up, the new Azimuth contract would issue fungible ""visa"" tokens, a portion of which could be bought and sold on centralized or decentralized crypto exchanges. Visa tokens would be convertible to newly issued, non-fungible planets on the Urbit network. But not all at once.  Some visa tokens would ""activate"" and become redeemable right away. A larger portion would activate a year or two after issuance, an even larger number after five years, and still more of them after a decade. The longer the delay, the cheaper a visa token should be.  The idea is to incentivize long-term commitment without locking up tokens. As Yarvin put it: ""People with diamond hands are rewarded for going deeper in, and people who want to get out have a very liquid way to get out, but they all need to squeeze through the same small hole.""  About that weird political stuff  For a long time, Urbit was overshadowed by Yarvin's right-wing (think Frederick the Great, not Barry Goldwater) ideology, laid out in impenetrable, tome-length blog posts dating back to 2007 under the pseudonym Mencius Moldbug.  In 2015, a technical conference rescinded his speaking invitation. The following year, another tech conference lost sponsors and was almost canceled because it allowed him to speak, over objections that this verbose, bespectacled engineer would make attendees feel somehow ""unsafe."" (Perhaps some feared he would bore everyone to death by reading his posts aloud, or torture them with his poetry.)  This year, that conference hosted a talk by Fitzgerald from the foundation, with nary a fuss, suggesting that Urbit, at least, is no longer radioactive.  While the cancel culture of the 2010s and early 2020s may be subsiding, bringing Yarvin back remains a calculated risk for Urbit, William Ball, the board member, said on the developer call.  ""When I heard that Curtis was back around, my initial thought was, 'Man, this guy's going to derail this,'"" Ball later told CoinDesk. But he said he and the other board members were pleasantly surprised when they talked to Yarvin.  ""I really felt, 'Here's a man that has clearly grown in the past five years,' or maybe I just didn't know him,"" said Ball, who is also a managing partner at Assembly Capital, a VC firm that invests in the Urbit ecosystem. ""But he clearly seems to have some wisdom and some maturity about the practical commercial realities. At the same time, he preserves this idea that there is a certain type of computer science research that has to be done basically insulated from commercial timelines.""  Yarvin told CoinDesk that, if anything, he believes his polarizing reputation has become an asset to the Urbit community because it filters out people who are more interested in making noise than getting work done.  ""The result of my political reputation is that toxic left-wing people don't show up, and toxic right-wing people have to be told to go away,"" he said.  To be clear: Unlike on centralized platforms, trolls can't be kicked off the Urbit network; they get booted from curated, self-selecting communities.  ""Inasmuch as Urbit as a society has any political mission, that mission is depoliticization,"" Yarvin said. ""That mission is to create a genuinely safe space for everyone, and when I say everyone, I mean everyone.

42417388,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYIRB,1724241600,"Story Protocol Developer Raises $80M Series B, Led by A16z, for Intellectual Property Chain","In a July 2023 op-ed, actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt argued that if artificial intelligence uses your work, it should pay you. That's the basic premise behind the intellectual property-focused blockchain Story Protocol, and it's quickly becoming a well-funded investment theme.  On Wednesday, PIP Labs, the initial core contributor behind Story, announced an $80 million Series B, led by the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z).  AI companies have hoovered up so much of the web's creative content to train their large language models (LLMs), which has resulted in lawsuits between creatives and tech giants like OpenAI. The New York Times is battling OpenAI over allegations of copyright infringement, and YouTubers are doing the same with Nvidia (NVDA), which is alleged to have unjustly enriched itself by building a video model using scraped content. At the same time, News Corp, the owner of the Wall Street Journal has struck a deal with OpenAI to license its content for LLM training in a deal with over $250 million.  ""Without great original IP, the AI models don’t develop,"" PIP Labs co-founder and CEO SY Lee said in an interview, emphasizing that AI is ""taking, stealing all your data without your consent,"" and benefiting from it without sharing the rewards with the original creators.  Story Protocol works by converting intellectual property into ""IP Legos"" – modular and programmable assets that can be licensed, managed and monetized through smart contracts on a blockchain. Lee explained that Story allows creators to assert control over their data by embedding licensing and royalty terms directly into their intellectual property.  ""With Story, creators can embed licensing terms directly into their IP, ensuring that anyone who uses it must adhere to their rules,"" Lee said. ""You’re declaring your sovereignty around the data. This is about saying, ‘Don’t mess with my data. This is my IP.'""  The debate about what AI companies owe creatives is of utmost importance to the entertainment industry, according to Lee. ""In the past, Google was kind enough to drive some traffic to your content, and that still killed many local newspapers,"" he said in a press release announcing the raise. ""The current state of AI completely destroys the incentive to create original IP for all of us.""  The project represents another use case for blockchain beyond yet another DeFi chain that draws from the same pool of users and regurgitates the same liquidity with only minor technical improvements.  ""It's all just infrastructure masturbation – another minor tweak, another DeFi chain, another DeFi app,"" he said. ""Everyone’s doing the same thing, chasing esoteric technical improvements.""  Story's mainnet launch is expected later this year, with more details expected to be shared during the Korea Blockchain Week in Seoul in September.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | SPONSORED | TRADING,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/08/21/story-protocol-developer-raises-80m-series-b-led-by-a16z-for-intellectual-property-chain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eca4a053754157a05ae618a5f164df2789cd3e1d-1280x853.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Stronghold said in May it was considering its strategic options, while Bitfarms is itself dealing with unwanted attention from Riot Platforms.  Bitcoin miner Bitfarms (BITF) said it agreed to buy rival Stronghold Digital (SDIG) for $175 million in stock and assumed debt as it looks to diversify its revenue sources beyond the production of cryptocurrency.  The offer comprises $125 million in stock based on 2.52 Bitfarms shares for each one of Stronghold, a premium of 71% to Stronghold's 90-day volume-weighted average price on Nasdaq as of Aug. 16, Bitfarms said in a statement. It equates to $6.02 per share versus SDIG's close last night of $2.93. Shares are currently higher by 64% premarket to $4.80. BITF is lower by 7% to $2.19.  Bitcoin miners have been coming to terms with April's 50% cut in the reward they receive for adding blocks to the blockchain. The reduction puts pressure on the industry to cut costs, particularly power usage, and replace older equipment with more energy-efficient rigs. While the event was no surprise – it occurs roughly every four years and companies had plenty of warning to prepare for it – it was still expected to unleash a ""survival of the fittest"" battle and send the miners looking for alternative income streams such as high-performance computing (HPC) and processing for artificial intelligence (AI) applications.  “After three years of ongoing discussions, I am proud to announce this transformative acquisition, which is a decisive step in securing a strong future for Bitfarms,"" CEO Ben Gagnon said in the statement.  ""By vertically integrating with power generation, expanding our energy trading capabilities and securing two high potential sites for HPC/AI with significant multi-year expansion potential, we are executing our strategy to diversify beyond Bitcoin mining to create greater long-term shareholder value.”  Bitfarms is itself fending off an approach by Riot Platforms (RIOT), which in June abandoned an attempt to buy the company in favor of overhauling the board and building its stake in the Toronto-based company before engaging in further takeover attempts. It now owns almost 19% of Bitfarms.  Stronghold in May said it was exploring strategic alternatives that could include the sale of the company.

Coutts believes the ingredients are in place for a broad altcoin rally, following in the footsteps of the “insane” bull run of 2020-2021. Altcoin Revival On The Horizon? The key catalyst, Coutts says, is the influx of global liquidity that is starting to accelerate. He notes that Bitcoin lags behind the upward movement in the broader M2 money supply, a crucial indicator of market trends. Coutts explained that the ingredients and progression for a broad altcoin rally are normally in place. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Continues Sideways Move As Outflows Record $39 Million Coutts’ analysis also highlights the underperformance of Ethereum (ETH) relative to Bitcoin, with the ETH/BTC ratio continuing to “bleed out” after a brief bullish signal in June. However, he believes this presents an opportunity, as ETH is likely oversold based on its historical performance against BTC. While the crypto market landscape remains choppy, with Bitcoin consolidating and altcoins testing the upper end of their downtrend channels, Coutts believes the pieces are falling into place for a renewed surge. The market expert emphasizes that the “Crypto Top 40 Advance/Decline Line (ADL)” needs to start leading price action and flip positive to signal a true market turnaround. Bitcoin Generating ‘Outsized Returns’ Reflecting on recent market events, Coutts highlights a notable oversold reading during the Yen carry unwind event, signaling significant assets hitting 6-month lows. The percentage of assets above their 200-day moving average (MA) remains at a modest 25%, indicating a general sense of ambivalence in the market. Regarding performance, only 13% of the top assets are outperforming Bitcoin, suggesting a phase where selective high-quality assets are poised to bottom out and excel once the bull market resumes. Coutts mentions specific coins like TRON and TON, which have demonstrated adoption amidst market pullbacks. Coutts maintained that the ingredients and progression for a broad altcoin rally are starting to come together. These include the assets being “extremely oversold, unloved and under-owned,” global liquidity turning higher in a “meaningful way,” and bitcoin generating “outsized returns” that allow weak holders to recycle profits into altcoins. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Secures Community Support To Rally To $1, Here’s How Reinforcing Coutts’ bullish stance, Julio Moreno, head of research at data analytics firm CryptoQuant, pointed to the stablecoin market capitalization reaching a fresh record high above $165 billion. Moreno argues that this “implies higher liquidity in the crypto markets” – a key ingredient for the next crypto bull run. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $60,830, up over 3% in the 24-hour time frame. Further consolidation above this level will be key for Bitcoin’s recovery in the coming days.

The company maintains a solid net cash balance sheet and the recurring subscription revenue business is rapidly growing, now making up 40% of overall revenues. I explain how investors can take advantage of the widespread skepticism in the business. Amidst a full-blown bull market for crypto, Coinbase ( COIN ) has thrived as top-line growth and profitability came back in full force. The company continues to see subscription and services revenue grow rapidly as it capitalizes on growing institutional investment in the space. Management has shown strong cost discipline, allowing it to show great operating leverage as transaction revenues rebound. The company maintains a net cash balance sheet though valuation is an important concern. I expect transaction revenues to face headwinds over the long term, though this trend might prove gradual as the company still earns much of these revenues from lesser known cryptocurrencies. I offer an options strategy that takes advantage of the high implied volatility of the stock. I am downgrading the stock to a neutral rating given the uncertain outlook for transaction revenues. COIN Stock Price I last covered COIN in April of 2022 where I rated the stock a strong buy as a long term winner in the crypto market. The stock has outperformed the broader market since then, returning over 40%, but the path between then and now has been anything but smooth and I did not predict the company’s stunning transformation. Data by YCharts I expect great volatility ahead as the market wraps its mind around the fast-growing subscription business versus the potential fluctuations in transaction revenues. COIN Stock Key Metrics COIN is a secure online platform that spans the entire crypto ecosystem, from transacting to storing cryptocurrencies. The recovery of tech stocks since the crash of 2022 as well as the launch of the first spot bitcoin ETFs earlier this year have led to a dramatic recovery for the cryptocurrency markets, and huge growth tailwinds for COIN. 2024 Q2 Shareholder Letter In the most recent quarter, COIN delivered yet another quarter of strong revenue growth, with net revenues more than doubling to $1.38 billion. 2024 Q2 Shareholder Letter The company posted $36 million in GAAP net income, which would have been even higher had it not been for $319 million in losses on cryptocurrency investments, most of which was unrealized. It is notable that COIN has exerted solid cost discipline, which has allowed for the company to fully benefit from operating leverage. 2024 Q2 Shareholder Letter Investors likely see COIN as being a tale of two businesses. The transaction revenue business appears highly cyclical and exposed to volatility in cryptocurrency prices, as well as vulnerable long term as more and more financial institutions allow for cryptocurrency trading. COIN saw transaction revenue jump 138% YoY to $780.9 million and should still benefit from easy comparables into the third quarter. When cryptocurrencies crashed during the 2022 tech stock crash, COIN saw transaction revenues bottom at around $1.5 billion for the full-year 2023. 2024 Q2 Shareholder Letter Even so, I would not be surprised to see headwinds from competition prove gradual given that the majority of the company’s transaction revenues come from coins other than Bitcoin and Ethereum. 2024 Q2 Shareholder Letter The subscription and services revenue looks far more valuable, as this segment showed strong growth even through the 2022 crash. This segment showed nearly 80% YoY growth in the latest quarter and subscription revenues made up 41% of overall revenues. These subscription revenues are more in-line with the general investment thesis of COIN benefitting from the “rise of crypto,” as much of the growth comes from USDC stablecoin revenue as well as blockchain rewards. 2024 10-K COIN ended the quarter with $7.2 billion of cash (plus $589 million in USDC) versus $4.2 billion of debt. 2024 Q2 Shareholder Letter That is a solid net cash balance sheet, but investors may be wary of whether the company could withstand a storm given the high volatility of transaction revenues. To this end, I should note that the company generated nearly $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA in 2023 and has more or less maintained cost discipline after undertaking dramatic cost cuts in response to the 2022 tech stock crash. That suggests that the company might not face so much liquidity risk, but what about the potential for high and sustained GAAP losses? The company’s operating expense run rate totals around $3.4 billion annually. Between the $2.4 billion annual run-rate of the subscription revenue business and the $1.5 billion in trough transaction revenue seen in 2023, I’m of the view that the company might even be able to survive the next crypto bear market with very manageable if not minimal GAAP losses. With stock-based compensation totaling around $800 million annually, I would further expect the company to be generating cash during a period similar to the 2022 to 2023 bear market. Of course it is possible that we see a bear market that is even worse than what we saw then, but we should also acknowledge that cryptocurrency’s resilience since then may have somewhat validated its validity as a place for institutional capital. Looking ahead, management has guided for the next quarter to see subscription and services revenue of between $530 million and $600 million and a solid sequential jump in operating expenses. 2024 Q2 Shareholder Letter On the conference call , management noted that this outlook reflects some headwinds from lower Ethereum prices, as well as increased costs related to a concerted effort to drive growth in global adoption of USDC. Management noted that in comparison with the 2022 to 2023 bear market, when the company was primarily a business built on transaction revenues, the growing subscription and services revenue means that the company may be even more resilient in the next bear market (and we saw that in the discussion above). It is possible that the company’s larger subscription and services revenue base might even help add resilience to transaction revenues in the next bear market, as investors might react with less fear and more courage due to increased understanding of cryptocurrencies. Management noted that they have a “huge number” of institutional clients of Coinbase Prime which currently have 1% to 3% of their funds holding in crypto but are just waiting on “regulatory clarity” before increasing that allocation to 10% to 30%. That verbiage should not be taken as formal guidance, but may be indicative of the coiled spring that may benefit COIN as cryptocurrencies continue to be adopted more and more by the institutional investor community. Is COIN Stock A Buy, Sell, Or Hold? At recent prices, COIN was trading at actually reasonable valuations at 38x earnings. Seeking Alpha The problem is that consensus estimates call for revenues to stagnate or even decline in the years ahead - consensus estimates appear to view the current environment as being “peak earnings.” Seeking Alpha The bulk of potential volatility is likely to be seen in the company’s transaction revenue business. The subscription revenue business grew at a near-80% rate in this past quarter and I expect it to sustain rapid growth moving forward as well. I suspect that there are two types of investors at play here - those that believe in the future of cryptocurrencies and those that don’t. For my part, I am not convinced that cryptocurrencies will be the huge societal game changer implied by some market participants, but I do view cryptocurrencies - Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) in particular - as having the potential to disrupt gold as an institutional asset class. The market cap of BTC-USD recently stood at around $1.21 trillion, still well below the market cap of gold at around $17 trillion . While it is true that gold has far more practical uses than BTC-USD, I am of the view that the primary value from gold mainly comes from institutional investment - and that investment has chosen gold mainly due to it being “not a stock, and not a bond.” I view Bitcoin to gold as being similar to video streaming to cable tv services. The market does not universally agree with this view, and that’s not necessarily a bad thing. One consequence of the prevailing doubt is seen in the high implied volatility of the stock and its equity options. Investors who have a bullish long term view of COIN but are unconvinced by the current stock valuation can take advantage of this phenomenon by selling put options for the options premium. For example, one can sell a cash-secured put option with a strike price of $105 for around $11.00 each. That would represent a cash return of around 10.5% over the next 12 months. At $105 per share, COIN would be selling at around 4.8x 2024e sales. It would be trading at a $27 billion market cap, which if completely excluding transaction revenues, would represent an 11x multiple of subscription revenues, which is arguably a very reasonable valuation given the high growth rate of that segment. Assuming a repeat of the 2022 to 2023 bear market, that $27 billion market cap would imply a 6.7x sales multiple relative to the projected $4 billion run-rate (which I derived earlier), which also looks quite reasonable given the company’s net cash balance sheet and high cash flow margins. This strategy may enable an investor to express a “value investing” mindset with the stock while still earning a double-digit forward return. COIN Stock Risks There are two main risks at play here. First, it is possible that the cryptocurrency market as a whole eventually collapses, perhaps the widespread skepticism wins out and institutional capital never embraces the asset class. Given the strong reception to spot bitcoin ETFs I find this scenario to be unlikely, but perception can change rapidly in a bear market. Another risk is if COIN ends up being disrupted by competition. COIN clearly benefits from a first-mover advantage, and I expect its transaction revenues to face long term headwinds as competitors win more volume market share. It is possible that its subscription revenue business also eventually faces headwinds due to competition, though the bankruptcies of well-known competitors such as FTX may have made COIN a preferred favorite for institutional partnerships and may represent a competitive advantage. A key risk related to the options strategy discussed above is that COIN remains a highly volatile stock, and it is possible if not likely that the stock might trade lower than $105 per share in a bear market as investors might not value the company’s businesses with a healthy valuation multiple. COIN Stock Conclusion COIN stock has performed very resiliently over the last several years which saw a vicious and protracted cryptocurrency bear market. The company has seen rapid growth in its subscription revenue business, which I view being akin to services revenue at Apple ( AAPL ).

The central bank's licensing framework for dirham stablecoins could give them a boost, especially given the reputations of Dubai and Abu Dhabi as crypto hubs.  Tether, the developer of the world's largest stablecoin, said it plans to introduce a token pegged to the United Arab Emirates' dirham in collaboration with Abu Dhabi-listed crypto conglomerate Phoenix Group (PHX).  Stablecoins are a form of digital asset usually pegged to a fiat currency that give users a hedge against the volatility that can afflict cryptocurrencies like bitcoin {{BTC}}.

Tether's euro equivalent (EURT), for example, has a market cap of just $30 million.

42417414,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYIkn,1724235478,Bitcoin Metrics Signal Weak Demand as BTC ETF Hype Slows: CryptoQuant,"On-chain data indicates a significant slowdown in bitcoin demand since early April, with metrics like CryptoQuant's demand indicator showing negative growth, reflecting increased selling.  Despite the bearish signals, some metrics remain robust. Long-term holders are accumulating bitcoin at record levels.  The total market cap of stablecoins has hit an all-time high, suggesting increased liquidity which historically precedes price surges. However, the growth in ETF inflows and large investor holdings has notably slowed down.  Demand metrics using on-chain patterns and holding behavior show weakening sentiment for bitcoin {{BTC}}, drawing bearish views to the largest token amid weeks of sideways price action.  “Apparent demand has slowed considerably since early April and even dipped into negative territory this month,” on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant shared in a Wednesday note to CoinDesk.  “Bitcoin demand growth still needs to pick up before we can see a sustainable recovery in price and the possibility of new highs,” the firm said.  CryptoQuant cited its demand indicator, which tracks the difference between the daily total bitcoin block rewards and the daily change in the number of bitcoin that has not moved in one year or more. Bitcoin rewards earned by miners are typically sold to cover operations, but an increase in selling from large holders indicates a waning demand for the asset.  Bitcoin price action has largely remained muted. In the past months, billions of dollars worth of selling pressure have flooded the market, denting optimism from the January launch of several spot ETFs.  The start of ETF trading in January and the Bitcoin halving event in May saw some bulls target the $80,000 level by June, citing a boost in demand, but prices are down 20% since May's lifetime highs. Bitcoin ETFs have attracted $17.5 billion in net inflows since launch, but skeptics say that flow could be arising for capturing a carry trade instead of representing outright bullish bets.  And the initial flows for the ETFs are slowly decreasing.  “The growth in the total holdings of large Bitcoin investors has also slowed, from a monthly pace of 6% in March to just 1% currently,” the firm said. “This slowdown in Bitcoin demand coincided with smaller purchases from spot ETFs in the USA.""  “The average daily purchases from bitcoin spot ETFs in the USA have declined from 12.5K in March, when bitcoin was trading above $70K, to an average of 1.3K Bitcoin last week,” the firm added.  However, a few metrics have remained strong during this period of weak prices, CryptoQuant noted.  Long-term holders—or wallets that hold the asset longer than six months—have continued accumulating bitcoin at “unprecedented levels,” with this cohort's total balance reaching a record-high monthly rate of 391,000 BTC earlier this week.  Elsewhere, the total market capitalization of stablecoins has surged to a fresh record high of $165 billion, a historically bullish sign that indicates increasing liquidity in the crypto market that typically leads to higher prices.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/08/21/bitcoin-metrics-signal-weak-demand-as-btc-etf-hype-slows-cryptoquant,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f306ef808637632ebe7c0f166745962d57bd360a-1192x670.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Institutional adoption of crypto assets, driven by products like USDC and regulatory clarity, is key to Coinbase's growth. Despite risks such as technology vulnerabilities and regulatory challenges, Coinbase's potential growth in the crypto market supports a Strong Buy rating. I first wrote about Coinbase ( COIN ) back in August 2021. The timing was both good and awful. On a short-term basis, it was very good with the company hitting its all-time high at $357.39 later that year, but zooming out to a longer-term horizon it was lackluster. Seeking Alpha Nevertheless, my thesis back in 2021 was that the company could become what amounts to a prime broker for institutional clients, and that this position in a nascent industry would give them a tremendous advantage. I believe that this is not wrong, and they are walking through that path. However, the cyclicality of the crypto markets and its impact on the company’s business muddy the waters for everyone looking at the company. Perhaps this is a good time to revisit this company. Business model pivot Coinbase went through tough times during the last crypto downturn due to its reliance on trading volumes. The company spotted this issue and developed a subscription-based model . The company made keeping positive EBITDA in all market conditions a goal, and it has managed to pull that off for the past six quarters. Although this is important news for the company in terms of having a revenue and cost structure that is capable of enduring downturns, the most important aspect for the company’s prospects is still adoption. Coinbase The introduction of the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs and the rise of layer 2 solutions, like Base , are the main drivers for institutional adoption, which is reflexive in the sense that it functions as a seal of approval for other participants. This is also forcing regulatory clarity from regulators that have not been proactive in their approach. Tether’s 5 billion profits from its stablecoin business are a testament to the potential of the whole field. There are other automatic rebalancers in the company’s business. The USD Coin, in which Coinbase participates in partnership with Circle, is a business segment sensitive to lower rates. As an example, a 25 bps decrease in rates requires the company to grow the USDC market cap by $2 billion to maintain revenue neutrality, according to Alesia Haas at Oppenheimer's 27th Annual Technology Conference. However, a lower rate scenario should also lead to a boom in crypto transactions (even if not immediately after a recession). Adoption drivers Actually, USDC is likely to be a key point towards crypto adoption. The company made the BTC/USDC the base trading pair for the international exchange so that it becomes a foundational asset for global traders. For instance, Coinbase is working actively to fulfill the MiCA regulations in Europe so that it can stand out from other stablecoins and help drive demand in Europe. This is a critical step to achieve crypto utility and real-world use cases for crypto. It is important to note that MiCA compliance will allow Coinbase to widen its offerings to the whole EU market, without having to go through a country-by-country approach. Additionally , the company is also looking to have a MiFID license in order to offer new products like futures and options on crypto assets. The company also seems committed to expanding its prime financing business for institutional clients, namely, ETF providers that need to buy spot Bitcoin to settle into the ETF and provide margin for institutions to trade digital assets. The company is also looking forward to building the necessary infrastructure to allow institutions to re-hypothecate their own balances, using them as collateral for loans. Financials The financials provide some hints that the ability to balance the company’s business during slower crypto markets is paying off. Although spot trading volume dropped 28% QoQ, the EBITDA margin held up well. This was in part thanks to subscription and service revenue that grew 17% QoQ, relating mostly to stablecoin revenue and blockchain validator rewards. YCharts Now, looking at Coinbase’s balance sheet is not a straightforward task. One of the most important aspects of the company's balance sheet structure is that, apparently, they hold all their client's assets on hand. This is a very important aspect because if they don’t respect this structure they are vulnerable to a bank run. YCharts Therefore, looking at the company's current ratio, we can see that the company holds current assets in excess of current claims. If we now ignore the clients’ assets and liabilities on both sides of the balance sheet, we will see that the company holds close to $7.2 billion in cash and has close to $4.2 billion in long-term debt. That gives it more than enough room to invest in further growth and develop the necessary infrastructure to develop new service offerings. Coinbase Valuation It is hard to frame Coinbase in a peer comparison. The problem is that the company is the only one crypto exchange trading in public markets. The peers for our comparison will have to be traditional finance brokers, which, I think, do not reflect the potential for growth and for scalability that Coinbase enjoys. Therefore, I will also add two fintechs to the comparison table, in order to provide a wider sample. Seeking Alpha Looking at this sample, the company is actually in line with other peers. The company is trading at 11x sales, which is in line with the other companies, except for Block ( SQ ). The same happens when we look at a price-to-cash-flow metric. The main takeaway from looking at valuation is that the company does not seem undervalued or overvalued compared to peers. Risks The company enjoys very interesting margins, and if it is capable of capitalizing on the growth prospects for the crypto market, Coinbase will likely be a much bigger company in terms of revenues and profits than what it is now. However, the underlying assumption is critical and poses a big risk. There is the possibility of negative developments stopping the adoption of crypto assets. Additionally, the company relies on several untested technologies like Base, the layer 2 Ethereum network that has enabled them to reduce fees in the network. If something goes wrong, the whole company might be at risk. On the other hand, the company has custody assets for its clients, which makes them a target for hackers and people willing to exploit weaknesses in the cybersecurity processes of the company. These are very important tail risks to consider because if, for any reason, the company loses access to the client’s assets, it is hard to see a comeback from this. In any case, a couple of considerations are also worthy. The crypto market has shown tremendous resilience in light of the pronounced swings it went through during the past decade, and it seems poised to grow given the political public commitment we have seen from US presidential candidates. On the other hand, although Coinbase constitutes a single point of failure, the truth is that the company has been able to develop a solid infrastructure that, so far, has been bulletproof. Conclusions The company is not cheap. However, the ability of the company to get itself entrenched in the institutional marketplace by being in the generate service and subscription revenue from Therefore, the company has been able to grow with the industry and the chances are decent that they will keep growing with the industry. So the question becomes how much will the industry grow in the following years? It’s hard to answer that question. We know that forecasts have been underestimating the market size, there were estimations for digital asset revenue of around $5 billion in 2024; however, we now know that Tether alone made $5 billion in profit in the first six months of the year. Forecasts have not been the best guide for the industry. In any case, McKinsey estimates that the base scenario for the market capitalization of tokenized assets is around $1.9 trillion. McKinsey & Company If this materializes, the case for Coinbase as a prime broker for this ecosystem becomes very strong. As we have seen, the company has been developing the tech stack to serve institutional clients, and they have been improving their business model around this proposition. If the market develops according to this forecast, we can develop two scenarios for Coinbase, one bull and one bear. The bull scenario is built on a higher growth rate, and it also includes a higher sales multiple valuation. The starting point in both cases is the revenue estimate for 2024, around $5.75 billion, and the share dilution is 9% per year. Author's computations The results show a risk/reward asymmetry favoring the bull case. Given how far the company has gone and the potential for it to go even further, I am keeping my rating of Strong Buy, originally posted in 2021.",POSITIVE,USDC,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | USDC,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4716116-coinbases-investment-case-building-resilience-and-unlocking-institutional-growth?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/32669300.jpeg
32669245,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=636773,1724232626,Bitcoin Resistance: Here Are The Challenges Ahead For BTC,"Bitcoin has certain on-chain resistance levels coming up that could threaten future rallies. Here are the exact prices at which they lie. Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Have Their Cost Basis At These Levels Ahead As explained by CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr in a new post on X, the BTC short-term holders currently have their cost basis levels between $62,000 and $65,000. The on-chain relevance metric here is the “Realized Price,” which keeps track of the average acquisition price on the Bitcoin network. Related Reading: Bitcoin Recovers To $61,000, Here Are The Possible Reasons When this indicator is above the cryptocurrency’s spot price, it means the average investor in the market is underwater right now. On the other hand, it being below BTC’s value suggests the dominance of profits on the network. In the context of the current topic, the Realized Price of the entire userbase isn’t of interest, but only that of a specific segment of it called the short-term holders (STHs). The STHs refer to the investors who bought their coins within the past six months. This Bitcoin cohort has historically acted erratically, easily selling whenever a major change in the market has occurred, like the emergence of a rally or crash. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the Realized Price of the STH group, as well as that of a few subdivisions of it, over the past year: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin STH Realized Price is currently around $64,000, which means these investors are in a state of net loss. The Realized Price broken down for each segment of the cohort reveals the STHs who bought between 3 and 6 months ago are in the deepest loss as their cost basis is at $65,800. The 1- to 3-month investors are close to the average of the whole cohort, with the metric being $64,200. The most recent buyers (1 week to 1 month) are in the best position as they acquired their coins at an average cost of $62,400 per token. To any investor, their cost basis is naturally an important level, but the STHs especially can be sensitive to retests of it. Thus, if the price rallies to one of these levels, then it’s likely that these holders will produce some reaction. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holders Now Doing Loss-Taking: Sign That A Turnaround Is Near? However, as the STHs are currently carrying a loss, they may be looking forward to the retest so they can sell and get their investment back. As such, Bitcoin could feel some resistance when it travels up to these Realized Price levels. BTC Price Bitcoin had risen above the $61,000 level but appears to have seen a sharp retrace since then, as its price is already back at $59,000.

42417392,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYIUH,1724228514,Zenrock Aims to Calm Users' DeFi Wobbles With Decentralized Custody Offering,"Decentralized finance adoption has been slow due to security concerns about using the new technology, Zenrock says.  Zenrock aims to address the one-point-of-failure risk with existing custody models by operating a decentralized MPC wallet.  DeFi hacks remain a major threat to the crypto industry, according to blockchain security firm Halborn.  Zenrock, the crypto custody platform built on the remains of Qredo, plans to ease concerns over the security of decentralized finance (DeFi) and accelerate the industry's growth by teasing users away from centralized offerings with a safer way of looking after their assets.  Investors use centralized exchanges (CEX) and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) because they have a fear of operating in the DeFi world, Chairman Dan Tapiero said in an interview. Even active degens in the crypto space are nervous about using DeFi, he said.  The problem with existing custody models is that investors still risk a central point of failure with the custodian holding their digital assets. Zenrock aims to address this problem with private keys managed through a decentralized multiparty computation (MPC) wallet. MPC wallets split and distribute private keys among several parties, removing the one-point-of-failure weakness.  Users' fears have a basis in the real world. Decentralized finance hacks remain a major threat to the industry, according to a recent report by blockchain security firm Halborn. Off-chain hacks including the theft of private keys are increasing and accounted for almost 60% of the amount stolen in 2023, Halborn noted. Cross-chain bridges remain a key attack vector for bad actors, it said.  “We can be the security solution in the DeFi and on-chain worlds for cross-chain transactions,” Zenrock CEO Randy Little said in an interview.  The company has designed a hybrid security model whereby the protocol is secured by its own token and by EigenLayer. Zenrock is “renting the economic security in Ethereum from EigenLayer, giving a purpose to this restaked ether,” Little said.  Zenrock plans to use a transaction model and the technology will be made available to developers, institutions and individual investors. The platform is currently in testnet phase and plans to launch later in the year.  Tapiero’s 10T Holdings (10T) and 1RoundTable Partners (1RT) announced the acquisition of substantial assets of Qredo in February after leading a bridge financing round. Little is a partner in both the firms.  “The series of transactions that we did to restructure Qredo into Zenrock has not been done before in the crypto space and included a combination of private lending, debt financing, bankruptcy/administration workout, restructuring, operating, product buildout and soon a mainnet launch,” Tapiero said.  “We are the first to bring practices from the traditional private equity world and apply them to the new digital asset world,” Tapiero said, adding that “many of the traditional finance (TradFi) private equity firms will follow in the years to come.”  Zenrock announced on Aug. 19 the introduction of a decentralized wrapped bitcoin token, called zenBTC.  The crypto custody firm is also backed by the Spartan Group and Maven 11.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Will Canny,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/08/21/zenrock-aims-to-calm-users-defi-wobbles-with-decentralized-custody-offering,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/51c594ab3bd2a3710289792cbec9ed8c0112b30c-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42417397,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYIZR,1724228096,Bitcoin Bear Trap? Goldman Says Wednesday's U.S. Jobs Report Is Likely to Overstate Weakness,"The BLS data is expected to show job growth in the year to March 2024 was significantly weaker than initial estimates, according crypto firm SignalPlus and Morgan Stanley.  Goldman Sachs believes the data could overstate weakness.  Wednesday could be busy for financial markets, including cryptocurrencies, as lesser-tracked U.S. data is expected to provide a grim picture of the U.S. economy.  Still, bitcoin {{BTC}} bears might want to exercise caution, as the data could be misleading and overstate weakness, according to one leading investment bank.  On Wednesday, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) will publish a preliminary estimate of the benchmark revision to the level of monthly nonfarm payrolls (jobs report) from April 2023 to March 2024. The report is typically released in the summer or fall of every year.  According to observers, the impending BLS update will likely reveal job growth in the year to March was slower than previously estimated.  ""On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will receive revised job growth figures, which may reveal that job growth from last year through early this year was weaker than previously estimated,"" SignalPlus, a tech firm focused on democratizing crypto options, said in Tuesday's market update.  Morgan Stanley expects a large downward revision of payrolls to 600,000 lower than currently reported, ""implying that they get trimmed by 50K per month in the 12 months through March.""  The expected large downward revision to jobs data could revive recession fears, triggering a shift away from risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, and a flight to safety as observed following the July jobs report released early this month.  That said, the downward revision could be misleading, according to Goldman Sachs.  ""Nonfarm payroll growth averaged 250K/month over April 2023-March 2024. While next week's [Wed'] revision could revise the pace down to 165-200k/month, we believe that a portion of that revision will be erroneous and that the ""true"" pace of employment growth during that period was probably closer to 200-240k/month, Goldman Sach's Economics Research team said in a note to clients on Aug. 16.  The team explained that the data is based on the quarterly consensus of employment and wages (QECW), which takes cues from unemployment insurance records. The insurance records exclude illegal immigrants, who have contributed to strong job growth in recent years.  After the BLS data, the focus will shift to the minutes of the Federal Reserve's July meeting scheduled for release at 18:00 UTC.  ""We will look for why the FOMC wanted to wait until September to consider easing monetary policy and if a 50bp [rate] cut was discussed,"" Morgan Stanley said in a note to clients on Aug. 18.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/08/21/bitcoin-bear-trap-goldman-says-wednesdays-us-jobs-report-is-likely-to-overstate-weakness,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3eff82a144368e28aaab192edebdd8cdea76120b-997x561.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Hedera code is open source and has an active public GitHub repository to ensure this is possible. Out of this, users can make code contributions, fostering collaboration and allowing the platform to innovate. Nonetheless, while the developer community is vibrant, its DeFi landscape was not as robust in Q2 2024. From the report, the platform has a total value locked (TVL) of approximately $64 million. This TVL, analysts note, is exclusive of the assets managed by the platform’s liquidity staking solution, Stader. At this level, Hedera lags behind competitors and is far from taking on active networks like Ethereum and Solana, looking at DeFiLlama data. However, reading from their asset under management, what’s positive is that Hedera is actively trying to differentiate itself from other platforms by focusing on emerging sectors. For instance, the report notes that the ledger is looking to power the rapidly growing Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) sector, and strides are being made. For instance, the review notes that Neuron aims to pioneer data transmission and service delivery using decentralized rails. The platform has made inroads in Australia by deploying its first sensor, a crucial step in increasing the number of its data-sharing nodes. Implementing HIP-540, Will HBAR Turn The Corner? Beyond expansion in DePIN, the platform seeks to improve its token security further by implementing HIP-540. Once it goes live, developers can remove and modify administrative keys. This effectively means Hedera will boost security and trust, which is a crucial development, especially as it builds its NFT ecosystem.

Technically, sellers are in control, but there are efforts to turn around the state of affairs. The token has support at $0.05. Even so, if bulls push on, breaking above $0.06, prices may rip higher, reversing holders’ fortunes.

42417403,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYIcX,1724226880,"Trump Tops Harris on Polymarket; Tron, Cardano in the Green as Bitcoin Sinks","Major altcoins like ETH, Solana's SOL, BNB and XRP, dropped as bitcoin's struggle to move past $60K.  Tron's TRX and Cardano's ADA showed gains, with TRX particularly benefiting from increased network activity due to a new memecoin generator.  Donald Trump crossed Kamala Harris as the most likely winner of the U.S. elections on Polymarket.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} reversed Tuesday’s gains as prices slid to just over $59,000 during the Asian morning hours Wednesday, continuing a spell of sideways price action.  BTC fell 2.6%, leading losses among major tokens. Solana’s SOL, BNB Chain’s BNB and XRP fell 2% each, while ether {{ETH}} fell more than 3.5% The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index tracking the largest tokens by market capitalization, minus stablecoins, dropped 2.27%.  On Polymarket, bettors are putting money on future price stability. Solana’s SOL, currently trading for $143, according to CoinDesk Indices data, has a 68% chance of staying above $140 by the end of the week bettors predict. Ether is also going to stay above $2500, they say, and is currently trading above $2600.  Meme coins PEPE and BRETT were recently listed on major South Korean exchange Upbit, while new token DOGS was listed on the Binance Launchpool.  Traders said that bitcoin would need to break above the $61,000 level and stay above it if sentiment were to change among market participants.  “Selling pressure has been building near this level since early August. Bitcoin, having added 3.2% since the start of the day and around 4.5% in 24 hours, has once again come close to testing its 50-day moving average, trading just below $61K,” Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro senior market analyst, told CoinDesk in an email.  “Overcoming this resistance from where bitcoin has been selling off since August 9 would take it to a test of its 200-day MA near $62.7K. A consolidation above these levels could dramatically improve sentiment in the entire cryptocurrency market and inspire more active buying,” he added.  Tron’s TRX and Cardano’s ADA were the only major tokens showing gains for traders. ADA rose 3%, while TRX jumped more than 10% on increased network activity following last week’s release of a memecoin generator backed by Tron founder Justin Sun.  Called Sunpump - similar to the first mover Pump.Fun on Solana - the generator allows anyone to issue memecoins on Tron, and the tokens are automatically listed on a decentralized exchange once they reach a specific market capitalization.  Demand for stablecoins may have increased on the Tron network, with over $1 billion worth of tether (USDT) tokens issued on Tuesday that will likely circulate within the ecosystem.  Meanwhile, in the world of politics, Donald Trump is once again in the lead on Polymarket’s election winner contract, with his odds of beating Kamala Harris now standing at 52-47.  Despite this widening gap, the market is still pricing in a very close race, especially in the swing states: a contact that asks if Trump will win every swing state only gives it a 16% chance of happening, while a contract asking if Harris will do the same only has a 28% chance of occurring.  While all swing states capture the attention of political analysts, two in particular are standing out this cycle: North Carolina and Pennsylvania. Of interest to analysts are the state’s shifting demographics – North Carolina's growing urban areas and Pennsylvania's suburban regions – and Black and Hispanic voters have evolving views on key issues like the economy, healthcare, and immigration.  Right now, Republicans are leading in North Carolina with odds of 61-40, according to Polymarket, while Trump has edged up in Pennsylvania by 1 percentage point and now leads 51-50.  Does any of this matter for bitcoin’s price, however? Probably not.

Ziemian will be brought before an investigating judge to determine where he would be extradited, the police said.  Polish national Roman Ziemian, the co-founder of digital currency trading platform FutureNet who allegedly defrauded users out of around $21 million has been detained in Montenegro, according to multiple reports citing an announcement from the nation's police.

An international law enforcement operation involving Montenegrin authorities and the Interpol resulted in Ziemian getting found hiding under a false identity in a newly developed residential area in Podgorica.  After conducting searches, officers of the Sector for Fighting Crime - Group for High-Tech Crime and the Regional Security Center ""Centar"" confiscated technical devices and items suspected of being the result of a criminal act, according to Radio Slobodna Evropa.  According to the police, Ziemian is suspected of money laundering, theft and violation of law, economic crime.  FutureNet's other partner, Stefan Morgenstern, ""was arrested in Greece and then in Albania,"" in 2023 a report said citing the police.

32663701,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=636846,1724223608,"Battleground At $60,000: Bitcoin Faces Pivotal Test As Bulls Aim To Reclaim Key Support","The world’s largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), has struggled to maintain a foothold above the critical $60,000 price level in recent trading sessions, as the digital asset finds itself caught in a tug-of-war between bullish and bearish forces. After recovering from a dip below $49,000 earlier this month, Bitcoin has been vacillating around the $60,000 mark, unable to consolidate above this key psychological and technical threshold. This price level has emerged as a battlefield between the bulls and bears, with the outcome poised to have significant implications for Bitcoin’s near-term trajectory. Bitcoin Faces Decisive Test At $60,000 According to market analyst Mark Cullen, Bitcoin’s ability to reclaim and hold above $60,000 by the end of the day could pave the way for a move higher towards the mid-to-high $60,000 range. However, should Bitcoin fail to decisively push through the $59,500 level, Cullen warns that the technical outlook could turn more bearish, with the potential for a sweep of the August 7th low. Related Reading: Dogecoin Faces Supply Squeeze: What This Means For Price Further complicating the continuation of the price recovery witnessed the past week after the August 5 market crash, is the presence of a sizable 1,000 BTC sell order currently protecting the $60,500 level, as noted by crypto analyst InspoCrypto. According to the analyst, a failed retest of this resistance zone could potentially catalyze the formation of a bearish double top pattern, which would be a concerning development for the bulls in the near term price action. InspoCrypto said: The $60,500 level is currently protected by a 1,000 BTC sell order. A failed retest of Bitcoin at $60,500 could potentially complicate the situation. Technical analysts might identify a double top formation in such a scenario. Moreover, the latest updates on the options data do not paint an entirely optimistic picture for Bitcoin in the short term, according to InspoCrypto, who emphasized the need to closely monitor the situation. Worst-Case Scenario For BTC According to crypto analyst Daan Crypto Trades, the fact that Bitcoin is currently trading above the $59,000 mark is a positive sign, as it represents a return to the asset’s Daily 200-Exponential Moving Average (EMA). However, Daan Crypto Trades noted that the real test for the bulls will come at the $63,000 level, which corresponds with the cryptocurrency’s local highs. “It’s an important level to break for the bulls to get the party started,” the analyst stated. Should Bitcoin fail to decisively surpass this resistance, the bears could regain control, with the $56,500 level serving as a potential support zone. Related Reading: XRP Spikes 6%: Can It Overcome $0.66 For Further Upside? Fellow technical analyst EmperorBTC echoed a similar sentiment, highlighting the significance of Bitcoin’s ability to reclaim its “macro range” and the resistance at the $62,200 level. The analyst advised against opening fresh long positions at current levels, instead suggesting that traders should look to “bid on pullbacks near the weekly VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price) at $58,800.” In a somewhat more cautious tone, EmperorBTC also acknowledged the possibility of a worst-case scenario, wherein Bitcoin could potentially retrace to the $52,000 level. However, the analyst emphasized that this would be a “gift to buy and hold” in the lead-up to September, hinting at the possibility of a more favorable market environment in the coming months.

32661477,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=636779,1724220002,Bitcoin Maintains Market Dominance With $42 Million In Inflows,"Digital asset investment funds witnessed another week of inflows last week, albeit at a small amount, to extend the run of inflows to two consecutive weeks. Notably, investment funds attracted a net inflow of $30 million last week. One of the key highlights of the week was Bitcoin’s strong performance in attracting investor interest. After being overshadowed by Ethereum in the previous week, Bitcoin regained its leading position, drawing the majority of the inflows. Solana, on the other hand, experienced its largest outflow on record, which was primarily driven by a decline in trading volumes of Solana-based meme coins. Bitcoin Maintains Market Dominance Last week’s inflow and outflow data on digital asset investment funds, as unveiled in CoinShares’ latest weekly report, reveals a cautious approach by investors amid uncertain economic signals. According to the report, digital asset investment products experienced minor inflows totaling $30 million. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Facing A Persistent Net Sell-Side Bias, Glassnode Reveals Investors were particularly cautious about investing in digital asset investment funds, especially with recent data teasing that the FED is less likely to cut interest rates by 50 basis points in September. As such, the weekly trading volume came in at around $7.9 billion, a 50% drop from the previous week. As stated earlier, the majority of the inflows went into Bitcoin-based products. They witnessed $42 million in inflows, which is a 223% increase from the $13 million registered the previous week. Next on the inflow rank are multi-asset investment products, which registered $21 million worth of inflows. These products, which offer diversified exposure across multiple cryptocurrencies, have continued to attract investor interest. Ethereum, however, experienced a dramatic drop in inflows. Ethereum-based products had only $4.2 million worth of inflows last week, a 97% decrease from the $155.4 registered in the previous week. Interestingly, CoinShares notes that Ethereum witnessed a flurry of activity between providers. Lastly, XRP also recorded a minor net inflow of $0.2 million, reflecting a cautious yet positive stance toward the asset after the recent outcome of the SEC-Ripple lawsuit. Looking at outflows, Solana led the pack with $38.9 million, which is its largest weekly outflow on record. This candidly reflected the current sentiment around the Solana ecosystem, especially meme coins. While Solana bulls managed to hold up the crypto’s price around $140 last week, the same cannot be said for Solana-based meme coins. Greater Moderation On The Part Of BTC Investors These meme coins, which pushed institutional investment in Solana earlier in the year, are now responsible for outflows. Short-Bitcoin ETFs experienced $0.9 million in outflows. Although this suggests a lingering bullish sentiment toward Bitcoin, it is a fall from the $16.2 million outflow registered in the previous week. This indicates a more measured approach by Bitcoin investors. Related Reading: Wall Street Titans Boost Crypto Stakes: US Bitcoin ETFs Garner $2.4B In Q2 Inflows In terms of geographical location, flows were very mixed. The United States led the way with $62 million in inflows. Canada and Brazil also saw positive activity, with inflows of $9.2 million and $7.2 million, respectively. Switzerland and Hong Kong saw the most significant outflows, with $30 million and $14 million, respectively.

32659228,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=636805,1724216407,Pectra Upgrade On Ethereum: Will It Be The Catalyst To Break Above All-Time Highs?,"As the cryptocurrency market continues to navigate a mixed period of price stagnation and volatility with no clear path forward, all eyes are on the highly anticipated Pectra upgrade for the Ethereum (ETH) network. Scheduled for the first quarter of 2025, this major upgrade is gaining significant attention from bullish analysts who believe it could be the catalyst to propel Ethereum’s price to new heights. A Potential Gamechanger For Ethereum? According to decentralized finance (DeFi) researcher DeFi Ignas, optimism is mounting around Ethereum’s prospects thanks to the Pectra upgrade. In a recent social media post examining this upcoming milestone for the network, Ignas claims that the update combines the Prague (execution layer) and Electra (consensus layer) improvements and represents a holistic advancement for the network. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Secures Community Support To Rally To $1, Here’s How Ethereum has witnessed several transformative upgrades in recent years, including the transition to proof-of-stake (PoS), the introduction of ETH burning mechanisms, and the reduction of gas fees by implementing data blobs. However, the researcher believes that the Pectra upgrade introduces novel features, with Account Abstraction as a noteworthy improvement. Historically, Account Abstraction adoption has been limited due to the complexity of interacting with decentralized applications (dApps) via smart contract accounts, leading to missed opportunities like airdrops. With the introduction of EIP-7702, Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) gain increased functionalities akin to smart contract wallets, enabling greater flexibility during transactions. Noteworthy benefits include the ability to batch transactions, facilitate sponsorship for transaction fees, and manage privileges effectively, bridging the gap between EOAs and smart contract wallets. According to Ignas’ analysis, this development will streamline fund management, automate processes, and enhance dApp interactions without requiring direct ETH ownership from users, enabling seamless operations such as approval and exchange within a single transaction. Technical Advancements & Cost Savings The Pectra upgrade also introduces efficiency improvements for validators, enabling the staking of 40 ETH at once, thereby reducing operational costs and enhancing rewards. Additionally, advancements like Peer Data Availability Sampling (PeerDAS) promise cost reductions for Layer 2 (L2) solutions by improving data verification processes. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) will also undergo significant improvements with eleven EIPs, simplifying smart contract development, reducing costs, and enhancing overall efficiency. Technical upgrades such as the BLS12-381 curve precompile, stateless clients, and attestations, in Ignas’ words, will further refine the Ethereum ecosystem for developers and users alike, paving the way for a more seamless and user-friendly experience. Ignas states that the Pectra upgrade symbolizes a significant leap forward for Ethereum, promising enhanced functionality, cost efficiency, and an improved user experience that will likely propel the network and the ETH price to new heights in the coming year. ETH Price Despite this impending bullish upgrade for the network, there are still several months to go before the introduction of the same, as the price of ETH is still unable to regain key levels lost earlier this month, in which the token dropped 25% to an annual low of $2,110. Related Reading: XRP Price Chart Signals Major Breakout: Top 5 Reasons To Watch At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $2,570, unchanged from Monday’s price, but down nearly 3% in the seven-day time frame. Furthermore, ETH is still down 45% from its all-time high of $4,878 during the 2021 bull run. While the upgrade promises significant progress for the coming year, it will be imperative for bullish investors to recapture the $2,600 level in the coming days to improve ETH’s outlook for the coming months and position itself to retest the notorious $3,000 resistance wall.

These 2 On-Chain Metrics Suggests a Bullish Turn,"Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap has been experiencing a prolonged period of price correction, leaving investors and traders questioning when the crypto asset will regain its upward momentum. As a result, an analyst from CryptoQuant has analyzed ETH’s on-chain metric and is now suggesting that Ethereum might be nearing the end of this correction phase, potentially setting the stage for a bullish turn. Related Reading: Ethereum Transaction Costs Hit Historic Lows: What Does This Mean For ETH? Metrics Signalling End Of The Slump According to the post by the CryptoQuant analyst Burak Kesmeci, key on-chain metrics indicate that the necessary liquidations on leveraged positions have occurred, and buyers are slowly regaining their footing. 2 Different On-Chain Metrics May Indicate We Are in the Late Stages of Ether’s Correction “Current data shows that buyers in Ether are gradually regaining strength. However, time will tell whether this is a temporary rebound or the start of a strong rally led by the bulls.” – by… pic.twitter.com/hrzhSLqdB4 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) August 19, 2024 The analysis highlights two specific on-chain metrics that point to the possibility of a bullish reversal. These metrics are the Taker Buy Sell Ratio and Open Interest (OI), which provide insights into market sentiment and trading activity. The Taker Buy Sell Ratio is a metric that measures the ratio of buyers to sellers across all cryptocurrency exchanges. A positive ratio suggests buyers are becoming more dominant, which can be an early signal of increasing demand and potential price appreciation. According to Kesmeci’s analysis, the Taker Buy Sell Ratio for Ethereum has recently turned positive, indicating that buyers are beginning to regain control after a period of dominance by sellers. This shift in market stance is a promising sign that Ethereum could be on the verge of a recovery. A Closer Look At Ethereum Open Interest In addition to the Taker Buy Sell Ratio, Open Interest (OI) is another crucial metric the analyst mentioned in his analysis. OI represents the total number of open long and short positions in the market. High levels of OI often indicate that a significant price movement is imminent, as traders are heavily invested in the market’s next direction. Kesmeci noted: In June 2024, when Ethereum’s price reached $3,800, the OI data hit a record high, surpassing $13 billion. This indicated a market correction was likely, and indeed, the correction occurred. On the “bloody Monday” of August 5, 2024 (triggered by events in Japan), OI dropped to $7 billion. The decline in OI, coupled with the recent liquidation of leveraged positions, according to Kesmeci, suggests that the market has undergone the necessary corrections and may now be stabilizing. For Ethereum’s price to move significantly, the analyst disclosed that it is likely that leveraged players will need to re-enter the market, driving demand and pushing prices higher. Related Reading: Will Ethereum Reach Over $3,000 In September? Analyst Bets On 80% Odds Kesmeci’s analysis concludes that while the recent data shows buyers are gradually regaining strength, it remains to be seen whether this is the beginning of a sustained rally or just a temporary rebound.

Elon Musk’s post sparked a frenzy among crypto investors and the DOGE community, reflecting on the token’s price. Following the recent surge, some analysts believe it’s only a matter of time before a major breakout. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Continues Sideways Move As Outflows Record $39 Million Elon Musk Excites The Dogecoin Community In a recent X post, Elon Musk acknowledged the leading memecoin by market cap on his response to Donald Trump’s political proposition. The former US president revealed that he was open to naming Musk for an advisory role or cabinet job if he won the election. Talking to Reuters, the presidential candidate for the Republican party called X’s owner a “brilliant guy.” He also suggested that he would offer Musk a position if he were open to it. “He’s a very smart guy. I certainly would, if he would do it, I certainly would,” Trump said. Tesla’s CEO took X to respond to the proposition, stating, “I’m willing to serve,” and sharing an AI-generated image. The image set Musk in front of a podium with the words “Department Of Government Efficiency” and the abbreviation “D.O.G.E” on top. The crypto investors quickly saw the reference and shared their excitement about the acknowledgment. Many community members took Musk’s post as a bullish sign and suggested that the memecoin is going “to the moon” again. Others brought back old X posts where Musk, referred to as the “Dogefather,” shared his support for Dogecoin against the global financial system. The apparent endorsement comes after Musk clarified the crypto stance. As reported by NewsBTC, the CEO made a virtual guest appearance at The X Takeover event at the end of July. During his intervention, Musk explained that he would not promote crypto but might address digital assets jokingly. Additionally, he added that he has a soft spot for Dogecoin due to his liking of dogs and memes. DOGE’s Price Surges 6% The memecoin had experienced a 9.3% recovery from the August 5 crash, when it lost its support above the $0.1 level and dropped to the $0.08 range. Following Musk’s post, Dogecoin’s price climbed to the $0.1056 mark, a 6.5% surge in the last 24 hours. The memecoin’s market activity also increased nearly 50% from one day ago, reaching a daily trading volume of $699.5 million. DOGE’s recent performance has made some market watchers consider that a bullish move for the token could be coming and that “all eyes are awaiting a breakout.” Crypto trader Galaxy Trading considers that the memecoin will likely “lead the charge in the very near future” given the current performance. According to the trader, DOGE often serves as a “key signal for the entire crypto space.” He suggested that investors keep an eye on it as it potentially will trigger a wider market uptrend. Some analysts concur that DOGE’s breakout won’t happen until the whole market gains momentum again in Q4. Crypto analyst Kaleo believes that not much has changed for Dogecoin since the market recovery. However, he noted that the token has established a “potential upper bounds of ~$0.111 for the new range.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Could Surge 200% To Cross $100,000 If This Happens According to the analyst, DOGE’s price will hover between the $0.085 and $0.11 range in the coming months “with declining volatility until the market heats up again.” As a result, he suggested that investors “stack and hold.” Similarly, renowned analyst Altcoin Sherpa considers memecoin’s chart “still looks fine.” Sherpa also believes DOGE is a good choice for investors who want to “hold a meme and be fairly safe with it.” Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",POSITIVE,DOGE | SOL,BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/dogecoin-2/dogecoin-soars-6-5-following-elon-musks-post-is-a-breakout-imminent/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/32652377.jpeg

32649072,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=636670,1724200218,Avalanche (AVAX) Consolidation Continues As Funding Rate Signals Possible Market Shift,"Avalanche (AVAX) has needed help recovering its losses in this volatile crypto market. Compared to other Layer-1 (L1) blockchains, AVAX consolidation could have been faster, raising concerns about its future performance. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) Continues Freefall, Sheds 12% In Last 7 Days – Can It Recover? Despite this uncertainty, recent price action shows AVAX consolidation above the $19.80 support, trading at $22.11 when writing and creating a positive sentiment among bulls. The Avalanche funding rate has turned positive for the first time since late July, and some analysts are even anticipating a potential reversal in Avalanche’s fortunes. AVAX Funding Rate Turns Positive According to Coinglass data, AVAX’s funding rate has flipped to positive territory, signaling a potential change in market dynamics. A positive funding rate in futures trading typically indicates increased demand for long positions, as traders are willing to pay a premium to hold them. This bullish pressure suggests that more traders are betting on AVAX’s price rising rather than falling, a notable shift from the bearish sentiment that has dominated the market in recent weeks. The current positive funding rate for AVAX indicates that bullish sentiment is gaining momentum, which could foreshadow a breakout if bulls successfully push the price above the crucial $23 level. October 2023 Vs. August 2024: Avalanche AT A Turning Point? Buyers hope a breakout above $22.79 will change the weekly bearish structure, and some investors are looking back to October 2023 for similarities. Analysts like Daghan on X anticipate a reversal and have compared the current market conditions and those in October 2023, just before Avalanche’s price skyrocketed from $8 to this year’s peak of $65 by March 18th. In his comparison, Daghan explains the intensity of AVAX’s uptrends after long and deep corrections, showing how fast its price moves after it shifts from bearish to bullish. Currently, Avalanche is trading at $22.11 and must break above this key resistance level to challenge the supply zone around $22.79 and establish a new higher high. If bulls can reclaim the $23 level, it could signal a broader market recovery for AVAX. However, if the market fails to hold above the August 5 low at $19.53, there is a risk of a downside move, potentially retesting demand below $17.50, with the next bearish target at $15. As the funding rate signals a possible shift in market sentiment, the coming days will be critical in determining whether AVAX can break free from its current consolidation and resume its upward trajectory.
