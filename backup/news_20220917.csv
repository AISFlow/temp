There has been a buzz around NFTs, with stories about fortunes being made with the technology for both creatives and buyers alike. And like with almost every product that does well, there has been an oversupply of NFTs. Now, everyone and thousands of companies/projects have an NFT out in the market. This has led to the polarization of NFT marketplaces with low-quality NFTs. You see these NFTs with almost zero volume on marketplaces. In stark contrast, there are other very rare NFTs with high floor prices and small transaction volume. These rare NFTs are mostly quality, and they are put out of reach for a lot of participants in the market because of their price barrier. Another big risk with the NFT ecosystem is how fast a collection can become illiquid as a result of volatility, especially in a bear market. This has resulted in investors losing their investments after minting some NFTs due to illiquidity and some other factors. Of all these mentioned so far, perhaps one major issue that should be noted is that the current NFT marketplaces around have more bidding mechanisms in place than auction mechanisms. This removes a plethora of game theory factors which results in the reduction of the potential revenue for NFT sellers and the platforms they are on.

The OKB price action maintains a trend between $13.5 and $16.5, leading to a bullish pattern reflecting an increase in underlying bullishness. However, as the neckline at $16.5 coincides with the 50% Fibonacci level, the buyers will have difficulty giving a bullish breakout. So, should you consider grabbing the bullish opportunity? Key Points: The OKB prices test the sellers at the $16.5 mark. The bullish reversal shows a high likelihood of an uptrend to $20. The intraday trading volume in OKB is $18.6 million.

However, the price action demonstrates the possibility of an inverted head and shoulder, as marked in the technical chart. Currently, the bottom formation at the $15 mark signifies the right shoulder of the bullish pattern, with the neckline at the overhead resistance of $16.5.
