42382354,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rLsZ,1563308107,Bitcoin Noticeably Absent From Senate Hearing on Facebook's Libra,"For a panel about a proposed cryptocurrency, Tuesday's Senate Banking Committee hearing was notably light on crypto talk.  Bitcoin was barely mentioned during the two-hour session and most of the lawmakers seemed far less concerned with the technology than with who was planning to leverage it: Facebook.  Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) put it perhaps the most succinctly. Responding to Facebook executive David Marcus' oft-repeated talking point that the Libra project was important for the U.S. to avoid being left behind in the blockchain revolution, Schatz said: ""You're making an argument for cryptocurrencies generally. ... The question is not, 'Should the U.S. lead in this?'""  Rather, he said, the question is: Why Facebook?  ""Why in the world, of all companies, given the last couple of years, should [Facebook] do this?"" Schatz asked, referring to the social media giant's data-privacy and election-meddling scandals.  Crypto savvy  Similarly, the remarks from Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) about cryptocurrency were FUD-free.  ""Despite granting anonymity, cryptocurrencies aren't the first choice for drug traffickers ... because cryptocurrencies aren't easy to use,"" she said.  Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), likewise, sounded much less worried about the granddaddy of all cryptos than about Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's new brainchild.  ""The volatility of bitcoin … means it won't be put in widespread use. While [Libra] is supposed to be put into wide use,"" Van Hollen said.  Another difference is that unlike bitcoin, where there is no central issuer claiming to have assets backing the currency, ""you do have to trust the Libra Association,"" Van Hollen added. ""When you’re talking about the world currency I’m not sure if there is sufficient sustainability.""  'Big potential'  And Marcus, for his part, did little to invite comparisons between Libra and bitcoin, instead positioning the project as a path to financial inclusion for underserved populations.  ""Our first goal is to create utility and adoption, enabling people around the world – especially the unbanked and underbanked – to take part in the financial ecosystem,"" he said in his opening statement, which made no mention of bitcoin or cryptocurrency.  In contrast to bitcoin's radical promise of a capped money supply invulnerable to political influence, Marcus said Libra, governed by a consortium of tech, VC and payments companies, had no such ambitions.  The Libra Association, he assured the lawmakers, ""will work with the Federal Reserve and other central banks to make sure Libra does not compete with sovereign currencies or interfere with monetary policy. Monetary policy is properly the province of central banks.""  And though he grilled Marcus on data sharing and consent, Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) sounded bullish on blockchain in general.  ""We shouldn’t prevent what can be a tremendous financial innovation. There is a big potential in blockchain technology,"" Toomey said.  Warning against hasty overregulation of the industry, Toomey said U.S. regulators shouldn't ""strangle this baby in its crib.""  Nikhilesh De and Anna Baydakova contributed reporting.  Sen.

42382351,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rLon,1563307247,Cuba Libra? Island Nation Slowly Explores Cryptocurrency Options,"Cubans are quietly exploring cryptocurrency use-cases on the politically isolated island, even watching Facebook’s Libra project with cautious optimism.  Cuban expat Claudia Rodriguez of the Brazilian startup Fusyona, the sole bitcoin exchange proactively serving Cubans, told CoinDesk the exchange has nearly 700 accounts since launching in 2018. She said up to 60 users purchase a total of one or two bitcoins every week.  “For Cuba, that is a lot,” Rodriguez said. “Cuba is probably going to be very interesting for Libra [developers] and I hope there will be some potential there.” In its launch materials for the Libra stablecoin, Facebook has focused heavily on the potential to connect the world’s underbanked with digital financial services.  Rodriguez’s Fusyona partners with five volunteers in Cuba, but keeps them anonymous because Cuban regulations neither forbid nor clearly permit selling bitcoin. As such, the startup is working with local lawyers in the hope of finding a “100 percent legal” way to enable peer-to-peer trades in Cuba.  Meanwhile, Cuba’s communist party recently announced plans for a national cryptocurrency project as well. But given the country’s long history of market manipulation, many Cubans are apt to distrust government-backed financial institutions.  Elvis Morales, a Cuban crypto entrepreneur based in Seattle, told CoinDesk he used bitcoin for remittances to family on the island.  “But the only issue is: How will they transfer that [crypto] to actual money in Cuba?” Morales said. “We don’t have credit cards. We have banks but we don’t use them, because the government could come to you and ask why do you have this money?”  Cuban expat Ernesto Alfonso, who used Bitrefill’s bitcoin payment options to help friends on the island pay bills, told CoinDesk that internet censorship of crypto apps and services adds an additional layer of complexity to bitcoin apps in Cuba, which often require a VPN for local usage.  Given that context, an anonymous bitcoin user in Havana told CoinDesk that Facebook’s crypto project could “open many doors” in Cuba and would be widely accepted if it was available to Cubans.  Yet Alfonso can’t imagine how Facebook’s project would provide an accessible option free from the risk of seizure.  “There's no possible way people in Cuba can use Libra unless we enter in the global monetary system,” he said. “At the moment, we are living in a different galaxy.”  Regulatory hurdles  So far, there is no evidence the Switzerland-based Libra Association could help provide a mainstream crypto on-ramp in Cuba.  Despite widespread Facebook and WhatsApp usage in Cuba among the type of unbanked people the Libra white paper prioritizes, a Facebook spokesperson told CoinDesk there aren’t any plans to make the Calibra wallet accessible to Cubans, due to American sanctions.  Facebook is already facing regulatory backlash at home, with multiple grillings this week on Capitol Hill of blockchain lead David Marcus and calls from lawmakers for the company to stop developing Libra.  However, according to a regulatory lawyer in the fintech space who spoke on the condition of anonymity, it appears money transfers to vetted individuals in Cuba isn't illegal. But, the lawyer said, it does raise regulatory risks that the Libra Association may prefer to avoid altogether.  As such, the Facebook spokesperson added:  “That doesn’t mean that other wallet providers won’t be able to do so – other companies are free to build wallets for Libra, so they could in theory build a wallet that would be available in Cuba.”  Cypherpunk vs. corporate  Most Cubans only started having mobile internet access in 2018.  Even today, their censored access is expensive enough that few use it beyond messaging tools like WhatsApp, several sources said. Most bitcoin exchange platforms exclude Cuba entirely, so liquidation mostly happens through informal swaps.  Cubans share many of the hallmark factors that drive bitcoin usage in Venezuela, such as an unstable local currency, strict capital controls and widespread mistrust of the government-controlled banks. Mere possession of foreign dollars was only legalized in 1993.  It’s difficult to imagine U.S.-based entities earning regulatory approval for crypto commerce with the sanctioned island. President Donald Trump tweeted on July 11 that he disapproves of both bitcoin and Facebook’s Libra.  Yet there is some precedent for Americans transacting with Cubans despite sanctions. Western Union, which currently handles the majority of Cuban remittance services, operates on the island with specific restrictions regarding amounts and recipients.  Trump’s tweets aside, bitcoin already offers Cubans global access to censorship-resistant transactions, despite how limited local liquidation options may be. Neither Libra nor Cuba’s future cryptocurrency could offer that. Alfonso said he doesn’t see how Libra would be accessible to Cubans without banking rails and traditional partnerships to assure Libra coins were accepted by companies on the ground.  “My personal opinion is that we should focus more on bitcoin,” Alfonso concluded, adding:  “In the end, Cubans will accept anything you give them as long as they can exchange them back for goods.”  Cuba image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/07/16/cuba-libra-island-nation-slowly-explores-cryptocurrency-options,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3af282d6bfbe248500eb04d6308e4148edd1e772-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Echoing other public officials who have struck critical tones in recent days, Scholz called upon regulators to examine the social media company’s Libra project. Scholz reportedly raised concerns about consumer protection and the potential disruption in the eurozone.  He was quoted as saying:  “The euro is and remains the only legal means of payment in the euro area.”  This point is in line with comments made by France’s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, following Libra's unveiling.  “It is out of question’’ that Libra be allowed to “become a sovereign currency,” he said at the time. “It can’t and it must not happen.”  The introduction of widely-accessible digital assets may interfere with states’ ability to manage their economies through monetary policy, according to Scholz. “The issuance of a currency does not belong in the hands of a private company because this is a core element of state sovereignty,” Scholz said.  In June, Markus Ferber, a member of the European Parliament, also called for regulatory scrutiny of Facebook to stop the multinational from operating as a ""shadow bank.""  Scholz alluded to efforts underway by German authorities and their allies to “ensure financial stability, consumer protection and the prevention of entry-gates for money laundering and terrorist financing,” Reuters reports. As previously reported, an international regulatory task force was arranged between the Group of Seven (G7) nations.

42382357,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rLxb,1563294636,'Expect Chaos': Polkadot to Launch Experimental Kusama Network This Summer,"An experimental version of blockchain interoperability protocol Polkadot will go live later this summer.  Led by Swiss nonprofit Web3 Foundation, the Polkadot team says the ""early, unaudited and unrefined release of Polkadot"" will be called Kusama.  ""Kusama will serve as a proving ground, allowing teams and developers to build and deploy a parachain or try out Polkadot's governance, staking and validation functionality in a real environment,"" Gavin Wood, the ethereum co-founder and creator of Polkadot, said in a blog post.  The highly anticipated project was reported last month to have closed a private sale of half a million DOT tokens (5 percent of the total supply) for an implied valuation of $1.2 billion.  Wood stresses that the Kusama network is meant to cater to ""new, early, high-risk functionality"" projects that are already building products for Polkadot. The network's mainnet launch is tentatively slated for later this year.  Starting tomorrow, DOT holders can claim an equal amount of Kusama coins (KSM) and begin experimenting on the network no later than August.  For users who hold no DOT tokens, Wood explained in his blog post that the Web3 Foundation would fund “a frictional faucet” of KSM for additional experimentation on Kusama.  The exact amount of KSM tokens to be distributed was not disclosed, however, a spokesperson later detailed to CoinDesk that the Web3 Foundation has at its disposal a total of 3 million DOTs (30 percent of total token supply).  The blog post also detailed that 100,000 DOTs held by the Web3 Foundation would be used as “incentivisation to Kusama’s stakeholders and community.” A spokesperson later detailed this meant KSM holders will eventually be able to convert their tokens into DOTs at a fixed rate set by the Web3 Foundation.  This participation reward, according to the spokesperson, could be 1 DOT for every 100 KSM. However, the spokesperson stressed the mechanics of this reward scheme are still being worked out and have not been set by the team.  Speaking to the ""canary"" network's primary goals, Wood wrote:  ""We are building bleeding-edge, experimental technology, which means there are no promises about what Kusama will do or how it will work – expect a lot of chaos (and a little fun).""

42382346,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rLjl,1563289980,Facebook's Marcus Says He'd Accept 100% of His Pay in Libra,"Facebook's blockchain lead David Marcus told lawmakers he would be willing to accept 100 percent of his salary in the social media giant's proposed Libra cryptocurrency.  During a Senate Banking Committee hearing on the controversial project Tuesday, the ranking member of the panel, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), asked Marcus if he trusted Libra enough to put skin in the game this way.  ""You really think people should trust you with their hard-earned money, I think it’s delusional,"" Brown said, after enumerating Facebook's history of privacy abuses. He then posed the question: ""Will you accept all of your compensation in that new currency?""  Marcus initially sidestepped the question, saying that Libra is ""not designed as a substitute for bank accounts."" After Brown pressed him, the Facebook executive said he would ""trust all of my assets in Libra – yes, I would.""  Only after the lawmaker pressed him again on the specific question about salary did Marcus answer in the affirmative, saying:  ""I would, because it is backed 1-for-1 with a reserve.""  'What the hell does that mean?'  The two-hour hearing was full of such exchanges between Marcus and lawmakers.  For example, when Marcus reiterated his talking point that Facebook would be only one of many companies involved in the Libra project, Brown shot back: ""You know better than that, only Facebook [as a social media company] has access to 2 billion people.""  Several times during the hearing, Marcus said trust is ""primordial."" At one point, Brown asked him, ""What the hell does that mean that 'trust is primordial'?""  ""It means we need to continue to do better,"" Marcus answered.  Aside from data privacy, lawmakers grilled Marcus on consumer protection. Sen. Kyrsten Lea Sinema of Arizona asked what would happen if a resident of her state using a wallet developed in Spain got scammed by someone in Pakistan. Where could the consumer go for recourse?  ""Americans will likely use an American-based wallet service,"" Marcus replied, adding that if not, their rights to redress would depend on the provider's terms and conditions.  Support for legislation  Speaking to reporters after the hearing, Brown, the banking committee's highest-ranking Democrat, said he would support legislation reining in Libra.  He sounded unpersuaded by Marcus' assurances that Calibra, Facebook's wallet subsidiary, would not share user data with its parent or with the Libra Association consortium.  Facebook, Brown said, ""can't be trusted to protect people's privacy. Facebook has shown time after time after time it's betrayed the public trust and I can't imagine there's anything that would make us trust them.""  He added:  ""If they're arrogant enough to just blast ahead on this and the hearing [seemed to show] that, I think legislation would be in order, I think there'd be broad bipartisan support.""  Brown said he was not sure what specific legislation might look like, and did not comment on whether the Senate would take up a draft bill circulated by the House Financial Services Committee banning large tech firms from issuing currencies.  He reiterated his disbelief that Facebook would have equal standing with other members of the Libra Association. While the company may have only 1 percent of the governing council's votes, ""Facebook, because it has 2 billion subscribers, will be the big dog,"" Brown said.  In Zuck we distrust  The Senate hearing was scheduled in the days after Libra was unveiled in June; the House Financial Services Committee will hold its own version tomorrow.  Overall, Tuesday's hearing was heavy on Facebook-related questions and light on crypto issues, indicating that the lawmakers were more worried about the company than the technology.  In contrast to the relatively measured introductory remarks of committee chairman Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Brown set the tone with three words in his first statement: ""Facebook is dangerous""  Bitcoin, the currency that started it all, was mentioned only a couple times, while there was much discussion of nonfinancial controversies like Facebook's de-platforming of conservatives or its role in election meddling.  As Brown later told reporters:  ""Clearly Americans don't trust Wall Street, they're now putting Big Tech into the same category.""

42382332,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rIob,1563282040,"Facebook's Libra Should Be Regulated Like a Security, Says Former CFTC Chair","UPDATE (July 17, 2019): This article has been updated with the remaining witness statements, which were published on the morning of July 17.      Libra is a security, says a former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chairman in prepared remarks to the U.S. House of Representatives.  Gary Gensler, who chaired the CFTC from 2009 to 2014 and previously held leadership roles at the U.S. Treasury Department, says in written testimony that Facebook's new cryptocurrency project looks like an investment vehicle and that Libra may even resemble some banking structures.  Gensler will testify before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, as part of a panel of expert witnesses on the potential implications of Libra. He will join Public Citizen president Robert Weissman, Columbia University law professor Katharina Pistor, Georgetown University law professor Chris Brummer and CoinShares' Meltem Demirors.  In Gensler's remarks, obtained by CoinDesk, he describes how the Libra cryptocurrency might be classified as a security.  At the heart of his argument is Libra's structure: Libra itself is intended to act as a kind of stablecoin, with its value pegged to a basket of sovereign currencies and government bonds. Members of the Libra Association, the governing council charged with overseeing the cryptocurrency's ongoing development after it launches, will receive a Libra investment token – a security token, as Facebook has acknowledged.  Collateral earned on the basket of currencies backing Libra (referred to as the Libra Reserve) will go to holders of the investment token, according to documentation Facebook published about the project last month.  Gensler argues this means Libra itself looks like a security, saying:  ""As currently proposed, the Libra Reserve, in essence, is a pooled investment vehicle that should at a minimum, be regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with the Libra Association registering as an investment advisor.""  'Pooled investment vehicle'  According to Gensler, Libra is a security for the same reasons that the Libra Investment Token is a security.  There may be debates on whether and how Libra qualifies as a security under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Howey Test, or the ""Reves Family Resemblance Test,"" but none of these are strictly important for this analysis, he argues, explaining:  ""It’s unambiguous that [the Libra Investment Token] is a security as it will receive a net return based upon interest on the Libra Reserve.""  In Gensler's view, the actual Libra token is ""part of the same pooled investment vehicle,"" and therefore faces the same market risks as the investment token.  The SEC is already considering whether Libra could be considered a security, and therefore falls under its purview, according to a Wall Street Journal report.  ""Further, investor protection will be just as important for the proposed Libra token as it is for investors in international bond funds or in commodity ETFs such as gold, silver, or oil ETFs,"" Gensler says. ""I also believe that each Authorized Reseller of the Libra token would need to be a registered broker dealer.""  He describes holders of Libra as a ""2nd class of investors"" in the Libra Reserve.  Bank too?  Securities concerns aside, aspects of Libra's setup also may fall under banking regulations, Gensler adds.  The Libra Reserve is effectively proposing ""a private form of money"" which can be used for payments, storing value and lending ""the proceeds to banks (as deposits) and governments (as debt securities),"" he says.  These applications are similar to services offered by banks.  ""Thus, there is some basis to consider the Libra Reserve as a bank or to apply bank-like regulation to it,"" Gensler proposes. ""At a minimum there should be restrictions on Libra Reserve’s investments and prohibition on its ability to lend or operate as a fractional bank.""  (It's worth noting there's actually precedent for a stablecoin issuer operating as a fractional bank: Tether.)  Myriad of issues  The other witnesses during the second panel also have concerns about Facebook's efforts to launch a cryptocurrency. The remaining opening statements, which were mostly published on Wednesday morning, outline a number of issues that lawmakers and Facebook developers would have to address.  In her opening remarks  , Pistor wrote that it appears as if Libra has been designed to act as a ""currency of currencies,"" but that its governance structure raises questions. Specifically, the Libra Association, which will be able to choose which groups can join it and is tasked with overseeing the network, maintains a large amount of power over the network.  ""This concentration of power is unmatched by any meaningful accountability to anyone,"" Pistor wrote, adding:  ""The choice of the legal structure means that the members of the Libra Association will be insulated from liability and accountable only to themselves. They will not be accountable to holders of Libra coins or to the citizens of countries that create the safe assets used to backstop Libra.""  The U.S. regulatory structure needs to be updated, at least in part, to better address these concerns, she said.  Brummer's opening remarks  begin with more of a focus on consumer risk, noting that the Libra white paper does not detail how users might lose money on possible runs on the currency, as well as how the governance might cause the cryptocurrency to lose value.  Public Citizen's Weissman, who was part of an open letter calling on Congress to impose a moratorium on Facebook's efforts to develop Libra, echoed those concerns in his remarks.  ""As a private, borderless currency, Libra will make it very difficult to ensure consumers are afforded appropriate disclosures, civil remedies, protection against usury, fair access to credit, defense against unfair and deceptive practices, and more,"" he wrote. ""There is good reason to worry that the Libra world will be a welcoming home for hucksters and scam artists.""  ""No matter what Facebook now promises, Libra and Calibra threaten to make Facebook a corporate surveillance leviathan with no precedent outside the realm of science fiction, giving the company dramatically enhanced power over information flows and our economy, while also potentially worsening the already serious problem of algorithmic racial discrimination,"" Weissman added.  For his part  , Marcus said Libra wants to make it easier for individuals to access financial services regardless of what their personal circumstances might be.

42382336,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rIsN,1563280265,"Traditional Money Could Be 'Surpassed' By E-Money, Stablecoins: IMF Paper","A new paper from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) suggests that cash and bank deposits could be left behind as digital money and fiat-pegged cryptocurrencies see greater adoption.  The Fintech Note, titled ""The Rise of Digital Money"" and published Monday, looks at how tech firms are increasingly competing with major banks and credit card companies.  The author's write in the introduction:  ""Digital forms of money are increasingly in the wallets of consumers as well as in the minds of policymakers. Cash and bank deposits are battling with so-called e-money, electronically stored monetary value denominated in, and pegged to, a currency like the euro or the dollar.""  Ultimately, cash and bank deposits ""will face tough competition and could even be surpassed"" by these new forms of value transfer, the paper warns.  Growing in popularity, forms of e-money like stablecoins ""may be more convenient as a means of payment,"" but the authors question the stability of their value. ""It is, after all, economically similar to a private investment fund guaranteeing redemptions at face value. If 10 euros go in, 10 euros must come out. The issuer must be in a position to honor this pledge,"" they write.  Banks should be able to stage a fightback against such payment upstarts, offering better services or similar electronic money products, the note continues, but policymakers are warned that some disruption is likely within the banking industry. Even so, banks are likely here to stay, as firms offering these new payment methods may move to become banks themselves and use their data advantage to offer targeted credit.  The paper addresses different types of new payment mechanism, including ""i-money"": an ""equivalent to e-money, except for a very important feature – it offers variable value redemptions into currency; it is thus an equity-like instrument.""  As one example of i-money, the note directly addresses Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency project – which is expected to be pegged to a basket of fiat currencies and government bonds – saying:  "" Libra coins could be exchanged into fiat currency at any time for their share of the going value of the underlying portfolio, without any price guarantees. ... The transfer of Libra—essentially shares of Libra Reserves (though potentially without a legal claim) – would comprise a payment.""  As for regulation, central banks will have an ""important role"" in shaping the future of e-money, with the ability to set rules that would have a strong influence on their adoption, and on how much they exert pressure on commercial banks.  The paper states:  ""One solution is to offer selected new e-money providers access to central bank reserves, though under strict conditions. Doing so raises risks, but it also has various advantages. Not least, central banks in some countries could partner with e-money providers to effectively provide 'central bank digital currency (CBDC),' a digital version of cash.""  However, the paper proposes a different public-private solution, dubbed the “synthetic CBDC” (sCBDC), under which a central bank would offer settlement services to e-money providers, including access to central bank reserves. However, ""all other functions would be the responsibility of private e-money providers under regulation.""  The sCBDC would be a less costly and less risky model, the paper says, and would still allow the private sector to ""innovate and interact with customers,"" while the central bank brings ""trust and efficiency"" to the mix.

Many of the associated exchanges do not offer fiat pairs.      A new analysis by Coinfirm shows the movement of the bitcoin stolen from Binance into various wallets.

Now, however, Coinfirm has spotted some activity that suggests the hackers are moving their gains off of exchanges, potentially into other cryptocurrencies.  The first transaction happened here while other transactions followed. Most recently, however, it's become clear that the hacker has begun liquidating the BTC on various exchanges.

42382340,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rIyf,1563274817,Key Bitcoin Price Indicator Turns Bearish in First Since December,"View  Bitcoin could fall to the July 2 low of $9,614 and may break lower in the short-term, as the widely tracked MACD (moving average convergence divergence) histogram on the three-day chart has turned bearish for the first time since December.  Buyer exhaustion above $12,000, as seen on the weekly chart, also supports the case for a stronger correction.  Dips below $9,000 could be short-lived, courtesy of an impending golden crossover on the three-day chart.  A weekly close above $12,000 would indicate a resumption of the rally from April lows near $4,000.      A widely tracked bitcoin (BTC) price indicator has turned bearish for the first time in seven months.  The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram – an indicator used to identify trend changes and the momentum of the bearish or bullish movement – has dropped below zero on the three-day chart for the first time since Dec. 21, 2018.  The histogram crossing below zero is considered a sign of bullish-to-bearish trend change, while a move above zero is taken as confirmation of the bull reversal.  Some observers may argue that the MACD is based on moving averages and tends to lag prices. While that is true, crossovers on the three-day chart MACD have proved to be reliable indicators of changes in trends in the past, as seen in the chart below.  As seen above, the MACD's drop below zero in the first week of January 2018 marked the beginning of the bear market. BTC's price then fell from $17,000 to $6,000 in the four weeks to Feb. 6.  The same year, prices recovered to levels above $11,700 by the end of February. The MACD, however, failed to cross above zero in the first week of March and began reporting bearish conditions, following which BTC fell from $8,300 to $6,400.  More recently, the indicator crossed above zero, signaling a bearish-to-bullish trend change, almost four months before bitcoin broke into a bull market with a high-volume above $4,236 on April 2, 2019.  So, there is a strong case to believe that the latest bearish turn by MACD may be followed by a notable price drop.  Again, seasoned traders would point out that MACD crossovers often end up as contrary indicators. For instance, in a strong trending market, a bearish crossover on the MACD usually marks an end of the corrective pullback (opportunity for bargain hunters).  Indeed, like every other technical indicator, the MACD can and does produce fake signals. Hence, it's advisable to seek an additional confirmation from other indicators and the price action in general.  The latest bearish cross on the MACD looks legitimate on that basis, as there are signs of buyer exhaustion on the technical charts.  Weekly and 3-day charts  On the weekly chart (above left), the previous three candles printed highs above $12,000, as indicated by their upper wicks, but failed to close (Sunday, UTC) above the psychological resistance amid overbought conditions reported by the 14-week relative strength index (RSI).  That is a classic sign of bullish exhaustion. Further, the RSI is now beginning to roll over from overbought levels (above 70.00), indicating scope for a deeper correction.  On the three-day chart (above right), the RSI has dived out of an ascending trendline, signaling an end of the rally from December lows.  All-in-all, BTC looks likely to fall back below the recent low of $9,614 (July 2 low) and extend losses to $9,097 (May 30 high) in the short run.  It's worth noting that the long-term outlook will remain bullish as long as prices are held above the 200-day moving average, currently at $5,961.  Moreover, any dip below $9,000 could be short-lived, as the 50- and 200-candle MAs are set to report a bull cross in the next few days. A similar golden crossover was observed at the start of the bull run in February 2016.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $10,670, representing a 3.8 percent gain on the day. Prices picked up a strong bid around the 50-day MA of $9,900 yesterday and produced a strong daily close above $10,700 yesterday, as noted by renowned analyst Josh Rager.  However, in the last 12 hours, the cryptocurrency has struggled to settle above $11,000 and seems to have created another bearish lower high around that psychological resistance, as seen below.  4-hour chart        The bearish lower highs and lower lows indicate the path of least resistance is to the downside. BTC, therefore, could fall back to $10,000 in the next 24 hours.  A high-volume break above $11,000 would invalidate the bearish lower-highs setup and could yield a rise to $11,500.  That said, a weekly close above $12,000 is needed to revive the bullish view.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42382337,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rItd,1563271206,Crypto Companies Offer Deals to Amazon Prime Day Shoppers,"As Amazon offers deep discounts this Prime Day, a few crypto companies are also rewarding their users through special deals during the two-day eCommerce extravaganza.  Fold, a payments platform that recently introduced a lightning network protocol, is offering a $5 Amazon gift card for clients that spend over $50 through its platform.  “Our goal with the promo is to incentivize more people to get onboarded into the lightning ecosystem and show off our incredible new lightning payments experience,"" founder Will Reeves said.  The company created a solution which allows it to connect with online and in-store sales systems to enable its users to transact with major retailers – including Amazon, Whole Foods, and Southwest Airlines – in bitcoin.  Since launching a week ago, Fold’s lightning network sees transaction volumes above $1,000 per day, “which makes up a nice portion of our total daily transactions,"" he said.  Fold will limit one gift card per account, which do not require KYC processing and can be deposited anonymously. At press time, the company has paid out around $100 in gift cards.    To the Moon    Moon  , a platform for crypto payments exclusively through the Amazon marketplace, is offering a 5 percent discount on all transactions for what they’re calling “Crypto Prime Day.” CEO Ken Kruger said:    “We figured that offering a 5 percent discount on Prime Day would both reward the hodlers and also incentivize folks to learn more about crypto. Who doesn't want to save an extra 5 percent? Maybe you have a friend who’s been skeptical about Bitcoin and that extra 5 percent off on Prime Day is just the incentive needed to get them to give it a try. Adoption is good for everyone.”          Moon’s 4,000 users will also receive Amazon Prime Day discounts even without Prime membership. The platform operates through a Lightning Network wallet of the user’s choice or through a user’s Coinbase account to make purchases directly from their Coinbase wallets.  Though the company is operating at a slight loss to run this promotion, Kruger believes it’s “worthwhile to promote adoption and to demonstrate crypto's utility as a medium of exchange at the largest eCommerce retailer in the world.”  Consumers aren’t the only winners in this arrangement. Kruger said several merchants have contacted the company to roll out discounts on the platform for consumers who decide to pay with crypto for future events.  While Moon is currently only available on Amazon.com, the company will expand its offerings to “new merchants in the coming weeks, like Nike” and will expand international access through Amazon.ca and Amazon.co.uk.    Purse    Launched in 2014, Purse, a marketplace that connects those looking to buy bitcoin with a credit card with users willing to sell bitcoin in exchange for savings on Amazon purchases, claims the tagline: “Everyday is Prime Day.”  While co-founder Andrew Lee said the firm isn’t offering discounts in honor of the eCommerce holiday, he said users of the platform can save an average of 15 percent on their Amazon purchases.  Additionally, the natural dynamics of the market mean shoppers today are benefiting. More people looking to convert their bitcoin for giftcards during a week where the cryptocurrency’s price has slid 10 percent, means people are receiving about “$100 of Prime products for $80 worth of bitcoin.”  Lee also said that despite the shaky market, and “narrative around HODLing,” Purse has completed a record month. He declined to share revenue figures, but said the firm takes a 3-4 percent fee for transactions.

In an op-ed in the New York Times on Sunday, U.S. House of Representatives minority leader Kevin McCarthy argued that it's clear governments and regulators are not able to effectively protect citizens' from platforms like Facebook and Google ""exploiting and selling our data.""  There are already in place (in the U.S., at least) laws punishing those that read others' post or healthcare records, he said, So why should online privacy be treated differently?  It should not, according to McCarthy. However, neither should we expect government to ""singularly and effectively do the job for us.""  Seemingly simple ""brute"" solutions like breaking up tech giants into smaller entities, as some politicians have proposed, may not actually end up increasing data security, he said. ""Invasive"" regulation, meanwhile, may effectively protect the bigger incumbents, while shutting out smaller firms.  McCarthy said:  ""Unsurprisingly, these remedies lean on the premise that only government can solve market inefficiencies that lead to irresponsible corporate behavior. I don’t think we should feel confident that the bureaucratic leviathan has what it takes to develop or enforce nimble responses to rapid change in the technology industry.""  Instead, the minority leader argued that a solution may lie in the free market, and decentralized ""cryptonetworks.""  With most current web platforms, user data is controlled by the platform and users are opened up to ""privacy invasions,"" McCarthy said. Whereas with a decentralized network, user data is encrypted on blockchains, enabling users to control access to their information and removing the need to trust third parties.  According to McCarthy, blockchain technology is ""capable of delivering stronger data security, portability and privacy for every user.""  As an added benefit, the open-source nature of many blockchains makes it easy for communities to create new networks if they feel the current system fails to provide adequate protections, thus competition gets a boost, McCarthy concluded.  In comments to CNBC's Squawk Box this morning, McCarthy said added to the op-ed, saying:  ""I like bitcoin ... The real thing I like when it comes to bitcoin is I like blockchain because I like the security. I want the government to start using blockchain.""

42382330,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rInL,1563249642,Polkadot Tokens Valued at $75 Pre-Launch in Crypto ‘Futures’ Offering,"Say hello to the IFO.  The cryptocurrency futures exchange CoinFLEX, backed by Polychain Capital and investor Roger Ver, will launch its first initial futures offering (IFO) this week.  “This is the first time we’ve made a futures market for a coin that doesn’t actually exist yet,” CoinFLEX CEO Mark Lamb told CoinDesk. “It’s a determiner of the price before the asset exists.”  Notably, Polkadot’s DOT will be CoinFLEX’s flagship IFO.  Stepping back, CoinFLEX launched in April with four futures contracts including bitcoin and ether. The platform then launched its own exchange token called FLEX earlier this month.  The Polkadot IFO on Wednesday will be the first sale that requires participants to buy the exchange’s native token. Modeled after the Binance initial exchange offering model, up to 300 FLEX token holders will have access to “discount” contracts priced at $75 per DOT.  A trader speaking on the condition of anonymity told CoinDesk this is generally in line with the over-the-counter rate for DOT contracts, since the token itself hasn’t launched yet. In order to reach the projected $1.2 billion valuation established by Polkadot creator and ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, prices would need to eventually exceed $100 per token. Wood’s Web3 Foundation and Parity Technologies, both organizations building this new ecosystem, declined to comment for this article.  While CoinFLEX’s Lamb declined to specify which firms are market-making for these contracts, he said they include Asian investors potentially offering “millions of dollars” worth of DOT tokens. (As CoinDesk previously reported, three Chinese firms bought investment agreements for DOT tokens for $15 million.)  “In order to buy at the presale, you need to lock up a thousand FLEX,” Lamb said, adding that contracts will expire four weeks after the token eventually launches. “We don’t know when they [IFO contracts] expire, because we don’t know when mainnet is going to launch.”  Much like Binance’s BNB token, FLEX can be used to pay exchange fees and access exclusive opportunities, like this IFO. Lamb said his exchange plans to offer BNB and Tron futures later this summer as well.  While most futures contracts across the space currently relate to live assets, like bitcoin, it remains to be seen what the appetite is for contracts related to pre-launch assets. While it isn’t a futures contract, the Hong Kong-based exchange BitForex has also issued the option for users to buy “Polkadot IOUs” for DOT tokens as a type of pre-sale for retail investors.  CoinFLEX’s head of business development, Emmanuel Alamu, told CoinDesk that physically settled crypto contracts carry fewer risks than cash-settled futures or IOUs while the asset itself remains illiquid.  “IFOs are an innovative way for the market to develop price discovery and act as a barometer on the progress of these blockchains,” Alamu said. “We can handle dual margining and hence, enact rules that ensure both sides of an IFO trade will deliver their respective side of the digital asset.”  Gavin Wood via CoinDesk archives",NEUTRAL,DOT | BNB,BUSINESS | DOT | EXCHANGE | MARKET | BNB,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/07/16/polkadot-tokens-valued-at-75-pre-launch-in-crypto-futures-offering,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2060ae311fba4e9139e8a5974fe44105e4a731bb-1280x876.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
