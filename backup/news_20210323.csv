42386221,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBS60T,1616540400,South Korea’s Largest Social Gaming App to Mint Low-Carbon NFTs for Millions of Users,"South Korea’s largest social gaming app, GameTalkTalk, has begun leveraging blockchain platform Enjin for the creation of low-carbon, non-fungible tokens (NFT).      According to a press release shared with CoinDesk, the social gaming company behind the app, Ludena Protocol, is attempting to attract new users by tokenizing fashion, furniture and pets.      NFTs have been a controversial topic of late due to their large carbon footprint created via the process of creating consensus in a proof-of-work mechanism.    Read more: What Are NFTs and How Do They Work?    By using Enjin’s interoperable bridging network and scaling solution, JumpNet, Enjin and Ludena say they can reduce energy consumption through a relatively new consensus mechanism.      The mechanism, known as proof-of-authority (PoA), refers to a solely permissioned state where only invited parties can participate as nodes on a private blockchain.      Using PoA, the companies say they can reduce power consumption by as much as 99.98%, when compared with other networks such as Ethereum or Bitcoin.    NFTs: A tax on users and the environment    Simon Kertonegoro, vice-president of Developer Success at Enjin, told CoinDesk via Telegram the cost of minting NFTs has been a tax on both the user and the environment.      With over three million users, GameTalkTalk has worked alongside major companies such as Blizzard Entertainment, SEGA and Nexon.      “We believe this is an opportunity to show these innovators how NFTs can help them build new environmentally friendly revenue streams,” said Kertonegoro.

42386223,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBS62z,1616532405,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Ranges Around $55K While Altcoin Theta Saw Price Spike,"Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $55,066.05 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 1.5% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $$53,031.33-$56,143.09 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC trades between its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the hourly chart, a sideways signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin was ranging between $54,000 and $56,000 after Monday’s big drop amid signs market sentiment might be continuing bearish.      The largest cryptocurrency appeared to stabilize after Monday’s 5.8% drop, the biggest single-day decline in almost a month, but some analysts said it would be hard to rule out a fresh turn downward.      “The market is not as confident anymore,” the Norwegian blockchain analytics firm Arcane Research wrote in its weekly newsletter on Tuesday. “More traders are positioned short.”      Read more: Bitcoin Transfer Worth $806M Might Reveal Big Institutional Purchase      Bitcoin, which doubled in price this year to an all-time high above $61,000 earlier this month, has failed several times to push ever higher.      One blockchain data point known as “reserve risk” offers hints as to where bitcoin is in its market cycle. It’s a picture of an asset price that has room to run before making a final push to a new market top. But that leg up might not be far away.      The reserve risk, a metric was created by the blockchain data firm Glassnode, used to assess the confidence of long-term holders relative to the price of bitcoin. Currently, it sits at about 0.008, far below the peak zone of the three past bull markets.      The market previously topped when the reserve risk went above 0.02, shown in the red zone in the chart below:      Jean-Baptiste Pavageau, partner at digital asset management firm ExoAlpha, said Monday’s correction may have partly been caused by traders squaring positions ahead of a major options-market expiration date expected on Friday. Once that’s out of the way, some short-term selling pressure might abate.      Data from Bybt shows that bitcoin options strike prices are clustered between $40,000 and $52,000. Many of those contracts are likely so far out of the money that an unwinding of positions ahead of the expiration looks unlikely.      Pavageau sees bitcoin prices consolidating in the $50,000 to $60,000 range after leaving behind a support level around $45,0000.      Bitcoin’s “overall upward trend” remains “intact,” he said.      Read more: Grayscale’s Sonnenshein Addresses GBTC’s Collapsing Premium      Rishi Ramchandani, director of business development at crypto lending platform BlockFi, noted that trading volumes have been “quieter” during the market’s latest move down.      Ramchandani says prices are likely to “hover around $55,000 to $60,000 unless we see a news catalyst.”    Ether underperforms but Theta moves    Ether (ETH) was down on Tuesday, trading around $1,707.95 and slipping 2.21% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      The No. 2 cryptocurrency moved in tandem with bitcoin. However, there was bullish market action from at least one altcoin, theta token.      Theta token (THETA), the native token for the Theta Network, a blockchain protocol designed to improve streaming video content, saw a significant price gain and was logging new all-time highs on Tuesday, according to data from Messari.      Read more: Ripple Touts Role for XRP in Central Bank Digital Currency White Paper      The price boost of THETA could partly be attributed to major network upgrades scheduled in April, according to Robbie Liu, market analyst at OKEx Insights. The protocol also recently announced that global music giant Sony’s European subsidiary has become a node runner on the Theta network.      At press time, THETA is changing hands at $13.94, up 34.90% in the past 24 hours, per Messari data. It’s up 586.11% year to date, for a market capitalization of $13.22 billion.

""Every time you print a tether, you should have a dollar being added to that cash pool,"" said William Quigley, who left the project in 2015 and now runs the non-fungible token (NFT) exchange WAX. ""Audited once a month, once a quarter.""      The comments on CoinDesk TV come after Tether last month agreed to a $18.5 million settlement with the New York Attorney General on charges of an alleged attempt to hide financial losses. The company admitted to no wrongdoing while agreeing to provide quarterly reports on the composition of its reserves.      Tether's dollar-linked stablecoin, USDT, has become a key form of liquidity in cryptocurrency markets – transferred between exchanges and wallet addresses to purchase bitcoin and other digital tokens. In February, analysts with JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, said a loss of faith in tether might pose systemic risks to the bitcoin market.      Quigley suggested Tether avoid mixing operational cash with custodial cash. ""I don't understand why they made it so difficult,"" he said. ""They're their own worst enemy.""      It's not just the issue of trust standing in the way of tether's growth. Eventually, the issuance of digital currency by governments could supplant tether, according to Quigley.      ""It would be easier for banks and financial institutions to hold something issued by government versus something held by a private company,"" Quigley said. ""How hard is it to get an audit done?""

42386212,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBS5p9,1616523028,Uniswap V3 Introduces New License to Spoil Future SUSHIs,"Uniswap has licensed the third iteration of its code bank in an apparent move to ward off would-be copycats.      The white paper for v3 of the decentralized exchange (DEX) was released Tuesday. In a possible nod to rival project SushiSwap – which copied Hayden Adams' creation bit by bit – the Brooklyn, N.Y.-based team’s blog post included one section detailing a “business source license” that acts as a time delay for commercial use of the code “for up to two years.”      After that point, the code will remain in an open-source GPL license “into perpetuity” for any project to build on or take from.      With the license, no one can copy Uniswap’s code base wholesale, although it's unclear if aspects of the code bank can be copied. It remains a large departure from the open-source nature of most cryptocurrency projects.      “We strongly believe decentralized financial infrastructure should ultimately be free, open-source software,” Uniswap wrote. “At the same time, we think the Uniswap community should be the first to build an ecosystem around the Uniswap v3 Core codebase.”    Read more: SushiSwap Will Withdraw Up to $830M From Uniswap Today: Why It Matters for DeFi    The license harkens back to the August height of ""DeFi Summer"" when pseudonymous developer Chef Nomi released a copy of the Uniswap software with a token. The token acted as an incentive for pulling liquidity away from Uniswap and into Chef Nomi’s project, SushiSwap.      Called “vampire mining,” SushiSwap’s liquidity games forced Uniswap to launch a token itself in September. That token is now the eighth-largest cryptocurrency when measured by market cap, according to Messari.      The two projects have since gone in different directions.      SushiSwap’s SUSHI token earns yield for every trade conducted on the exchange, leading to increased liquidity over its rival exchange.

42386205,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBS5gL,1616519407,Uniswap Unveils Version 3 in Bid to Stay DeFi's Top Dog,"Uniswap, the leading decentralized exchange (DEX) on Ethereum and a centerpiece of the $42 billion decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, is releasing its third iteration.      In a Tuesday blog post, the firm behind the platform said its aim is to make Uniswap ""the most flexible and efficient [automated market maker] ever designed."" AMMs – once nearly solely the domain of Uniswap – have grown in stature along with DeFi’s emergence last year. Rivals like SushiSwap, 1inch and others have also made the exchange of Ethereum-based assets easy for many crypto natives.      Uniswap v3 is expected to launch on mainnet on May 5, the firm wrote. Notably, Uniswap is eyeing an integration ""soon after"" with Ethereum throughput booster Optimism.      All told, the new version promises greater ""up to [4,000 times] capital efficiency relative to Uniswap v2,"" the firm wrote.      The key change, as outlined in the new white paper, is what Uniswap is calling ""concentrated liquidity.""      ""In this paper, we present Uniswap v3, a novel AMM that gives liquidity providers more control over the price ranges in which their capital is used, with limited effect on liquidity fragmentation and gas inefficiency,"" it states.      The lead author of the white paper was Hayden Adams, Uniswap's founder, and three other members of the team. It also includes Dan Robinson of Paradigm, the VC fund led by Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam.      Concentrated liquidity allows liquidity providers (LP) to set minimum and maximum prices on their portion of any given pool.    New fee structure    The new version further allows different pools to be created with different fees. Up to now, all trades in all Uniswap pools have had a 0.03% fee for trading.      ""While this fee historically seems to have worked well enough for many tokens, it is likely too high for some pools (such as pools between two stablecoins), and likely too low for others (such as pools that include highly volatile or rarely traded tokens),"" the white paper states.      That said, more than one pool can be created with different fees.      A key change for the composability of Uniswap may be in its removal of native ERC-20 tokens to represent LP positions.      ""The changes made in Uniswap v3 force this issue by making completely fungible liquidity tokens impossible,"" the paper states. It indicates that others can create their own ways of representing these positions.      Additional reporting will be necessary to determine the implications of changes for tracking LP positions. The blog post promises this actually increases flexibility for users, however, stating:    ""Over time we expect increasingly sophisticated strategies to be tokenized, making it possible for LPs to participate while maintaining a passive user experience. This could include multi-positions, auto-rebalancing to concentrate around the market price, fee reinvestment, lending, and more.""    Lastly, the blog post describes a major change to licensing this new version:    ""With this in mind, Uniswap v3 Core will launch under the Business Source License 1.1 – effectively a time-delayed GPL-2.0-or-later license. The license limits use of the v3 source code in a commercial or production setting for up to two years, at which point it will convert to a GPL license into perpetuity.""    The white paper continues to describe UNI as the governance token for the latest version of the protocol, first introduced in September.      Uniswap is currently the sixth-largest protocol listed on DeFi Pulse, at $4.04 billion in total value locked as of this writing, trailing fellow automated makers SushiSwap and Curve Finance.

This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    A lot of people are having some version of this discussion at the moment.      With BTC’s price rising and lots of green-minded VIPs, like Elon Musk, endorsing the idea, the long-running bitcoin energy debate is seeing new life.      I replied as many people working in bitcoin do: It’s not as bad as the mainstream media says. The fiat money system also uses a lot of energy. It’s going to get cleaner as renewables come online.      See also: Nic Carter - The Frustrating, Maddening, All-Consuming Bitcoin Energy Debate      Later, I wished I’d framed it differently.      What I really think is 1) bitcoin is currently dirty but ultimately worth it and 2) technology will fix the problem. Let me explain.      Bitcoin is worth it because it is a fundamental innovation with many uses in itself and for humanity at large. Shutting it down now, as some would like to do for climate reasons, would be like stopping car development with the Model T. You have to give it time.      Technology will fix the problem because that’s what technology does. In fact, it might already be happening.      As CoinDesk’s Michael Casey wrote last week, there are lots of promising experiments underway to co-locate bitcoin mining with renewable energy production, funding the latter while cleaning up the former. Even more interestingly, bitcoin has potential as a “money battery,” soaking up excess renewable power where it can’t be consumed and transferring it to where it can be used effectively.      Nick Grossman, of Union Square Ventures, posted a nice write-up of the battery concept over the weekend. In closing, he wrote:    I believe the properties of bitcoin’s battery are powerful and profound, and will lead to the kinds of solutions I point to here. And as we have learned from our experience with this technology so far, that’s certainly only the beginning of what will be possible.    Exactly.      The takeaway? This debate needs to move on. We need to stop arguing about the exact size of the bitcoin energy issue or about whether it’s really a problem and start talking about what we’re going to do about it.      The best place to start is the grid itself and incentives to lower the cost of electricity. If renewables are cheaper and more plentiful, everyone, including and especially miners, will use them.      See also: Ben Schiller - ‘Green’ Bitcoin Is the Price of Mass Adoption      So here’s a proposal. As the Biden Administration considers a massive bill to integrate and upgrade the U.S. grid, what about incentives for miners and renewable power companies to work together?      In tandem they could really fund a new generation of cleaner energy while also bringing a new form of money with myriad benefits for the world. What about, say, extra tax credits for renewable producers that work with miners?      The problem isn’t a lack of power to run everything. It’s a lack of coordination in using that power efficiently and where it’s needed. Bitcoin is a burden but it’s also a possible fix. Let’s embrace the challenge rather than run away from it.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Benjamin Schiller,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/03/23/the-node-bidens-grid-plans-can-clean-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a760a7e6283b2017fa1af3b803df942c4cf00d12-1420x947.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386220,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBS5zD,1616516932,Bitcoin Transfer Worth $806M Might Reveal Big Institutional Purchase,"Digital-asset traders and analysts were scrambling Tuesday to assess a fresh data point extracted from the Bitcoin blockchain: Some $806 million worth of the cryptocurrency apparently transferred earlier in the day off of the Coinbase exchange's institution-focused unit, Coinbase Pro.      The jury is out on what it means. It could be that a large investor or several just completed a fresh round of buying and now are taking the bounty off the exchange for long-term holding or other purposes. Or it might be something else more innocuous, such as an internal transfer.      According to data provided by the blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant, some 14,666 BTC were moved off the exchange during the early U.S. hours in a small number of transactions.      The transfer came after bitcoin prices tumbled Monday by the most in a month to about $54,000, a level the market hasn't seen for almost two weeks. By Tuesday, the largest cryptocurrency had steadied and was changing hands around $55,000.      ""The outflow was split into multiple wallets, which could be their hot wallets, representing an internal transfer or custodian wallets for institutions,"" Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, told CoinDesk.      Coinbase's cold wallets for custody are directly integrated with the exchange's over-the-counter (OTC) desk. Institutions and large traders typically trade via OTC desks to avoid influencing the market price too much. Hence, outflows from Coinbase Pro are often taken to represent institutional demand for bitcoin.      ""I think it's likely to be a custodian wallet, which might indicate institutions are still buying the dip,"" Ju said. But he added that was just a speculative guess.      CryptoQuant found itself at the center of a controversy last week, when one of its blockchain-data alerts signaled an apparent transfer of $1.1 billion in bitcoin onto the Winklevoss twins' Gemini exchange, possibly indicating big selling pressure ahead. A backlash resulted on Twitter, with some posters arguing the data was mislabeled or misinterpreted.      Ju subsequently promised to change the company's procedures to avoid confusion, CoinDesk reported. But the episode underscored the hazards associated with reading too much into isolated blockchain data points.      While Ju is not sure about the nature of the latest outflow, the crypto community is cheering the data on Twitter. ""Bullish signal, Big BTC outflow from Coinbase Pro,"" one user tweeted.      The exuberant reaction can be explained by the chart below, which shows bitcoin's previous price pullbacks have ended with a pickup in outflows from Coinbase Pro.      It remains to be seen if history repeats itself. Bitcoin is currently trading near $55,000, having dropped to a low of $53,031 during the Asian hours.

42386219,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBS5xx,1616516215,Fascism on the Blockchain? The Work of Art in the Age of NFTs,"The Aestheticization of Politics    When, in 1935, Walter Benjamin undertook his critique of ""the work of art in the age of technological reproducibility,"" this age was in its infancy. He saw in mechanical reproduction a set of possibilities that not only had consequences for art but would change its nature as a medium of social relations.      In a way that can still startle readers, he wrote the emerging capacities of mechanical reproduction, particularly in photography and cinema, might eliminate familiar ways of creating art and ""brush aside a number of outmoded concepts, such as creativity and genius, eternal value and mystery – concepts whose uncontrolled (and at present almost uncontrollable) application would lead to a processing of data in the Fascist sense.""    Jonathan Beller is professor of Media Studies at Pratt Institute and member of the Economic Space Agency (ECSA) think tank. His forthcoming book, ""The World Computer: Derivative Conditions of Racial Capitalism,"" will be published by Duke University Press in 2021.    Benjamin, who committed suicide while fleeing from the Nazis a few years later, clearly recognized the preservation of cultic values (""genius,"" ""mystery,"" ""authenticity,"" etc.) in the art of a new media ecology capable of greater democracy served primarily to preserve existing property relations. ""The logical result of Fascism is the introduction of aesthetics into political life” and the rise, or rather redeployment, of cult worship through mass entertainment.      Cinema, in particular, was forced to produce celebrities and spectacle rather than be used to connect people and enable them to see and understand one another as creators of value. Under this form of production, benighted individuals served as stand-ins for everyone else, allowing for greater control of people’s desires and, therefore, ability to act. Produced by the masses, celebrity is the alienated (and indeed expropriated) agency of the masses.      Today, despite their promises to horizontalize communication and knowledge, both cinema and social media are already taken over by the star and influencer systems. Online identity is composed by collapsing and subsuming other people’s attention into one’s profile, in what could be seen as a fractalization of the type of fascism Benjamin described.      See also: Jonathan Beller – How We Short Capitalism – And Finance the Revolution      It should give us pause to see the emergent medium that is cryptocurrency undergoing a similar violation. Just as there was a cinema before celebrity culture, and before the medium was adapted to fascistic purposes, there could be another mode of online creation. Is it the historical role of cryptocurrency to take global aspirations for solutions to monetary and social inequality and use this energy to elevate billionaires and artistic geniuses over the masses?    Non-fascist tokens?    With the current use of NFTs (non-fungible tokens), blockchain, far from being a system for the radical disintermediation of vested interests, is being ""pressed"" to redeploy cult values of the capitalist art world and enhance the aura of the unique work of art. It is being used, as Benjamin so presciently understood with respect to the aesthetics of cult value, to ""process data in the fascist sense.""      If we are not very careful – and very smart – we will feed the aesthetics of sovereign greed, and botch the historic opportunity to use cryptomedia to create aesthetic forms of community that genuinely, which means also materially and politically, serve the world community.      See also: Elena Giralt – Crypto Co-ops and Game Theory: Why the Internet Must Learn to Collaborate to Survive      It is hard here, in a brief comment, to express the degree to which the radical financial imagination is being targeted by a gold rush in NFTs whose very collectibility and value proposition would aim to secure a future not radically different from the economic and cultural conditions of the present or the past, one in which the gods of value – geniuses and creatives – lord their spectacular power over the masses who themselves have created that power.      But the NFT explosion, which threatens to make all art the art of making money, shows the persistence of a financial imagination organized through racial capitalism: artworks become cultic derivatives of fascistic protocols. This fractalization of fascist aesthetics and practices becomes an active, if disavowed or even unconscious (because naturalized), force in platform design and utilization.      This argument, that fascist aesthetics are now on blockchain, will not be well received, I'm sure. But the buzzkill here, that effectively says ""meet the new boss, same as the old boss,"" is not gratuitous. The frenzy around NFTs, the gold rush to get in on the ground floor to individually create and possess attractors that will accumulate future capital, is the exact recipe for a fascism (and for a fractal fascism) that out of the right side of its mouth promises democracy and recognition as it makes its way to the bank to cash in on hierarchy and class difference.    Make art though the world shall perish.    From Benjamin's perspective, but not only his, this application of a new media form with the potential to transform social relations would be a reactionary application: cryptomedia ""pressed"" to do the same old things with the same old hierarchies as in past modes of inequality and domination.      What's wrong with cashing in and elevating artists and collectors far above the hordes? A programmable economic medium has, in principle at least, the capacity to democratize finance and indeed to create economic democracy to an extent never before seen. The NFT in and of itself, the ERC 721 or 1135, is not by definition a fascist form.      It is possible, for example, to imagine powerful uses for tokens that serve as unique identifiers for agreements between parties that can in turn be used to collateralize transactions. I offer you X, you offer me Y and based on that agreement we not only build something new but have the means to finance it and share stake with others in our network. Multiply by a billion.      But the sudden perfect fit of the NFT with the cult of genius, and the cult of personality, great artist, celebrity, super athlete and billionaire does not bode well for the democratic and post-capitalist promise of blockchain as the infrastructure of a sustainable world. Playing into habitual aesthetic ideals, this fit with a reactionary tradition threatens to obscure what is really radical about shared stake in aesthetic performance and value creation. Some will shrug, dismiss the ""dreamers"" and say so what, I don't care if there's blood in my code so long as I'm getting paid. That, of course, is the world we know. There's blood in the banks, in the money and in the code.      But cryptomedia has the potential to do more and better. It has the potential, through disintermediation and remediation, to remake the fabric of society in accord with the call of justice. For this we must also keep art, which has the potential both to create forms of beauty only dreamt of and to transform social relations by creating new aesthetics of relation, from turning into its antithesis – a rationale for the supervaluation of charismatic personalities whose very existence depends upon inequality.      ""Fiat ars – pereat mundus [make art though the world shall perish], says Fascism,"" wrote Benjamin at the end of his essay on the work of art. He understood the belief in ""art for art's sake"" is not only a fascist anthem, but also a way of aestheticizing politics: creating the pleasures, cultures and ritual structures of legitimation that justify or disavow the underlying dispossessions, forced migrations and genocides vertically integrated into its presumably apolitical values.      MetaKovan's $69 million Beeple, about which he said ""is going to be a billion-dollar piece, I don't know when,"" locks up in that valuation a lot of human life in its code even at its current price. This isn't a mere fact, it’s a fact mediated by a particular understanding of the role of culture and of finance. At the $1,000-per-year rate paid to much of the working poor in the Global South, that Beeple NFT, with 5,000 days of the artist's work attached to it, becomes valued at about 69,000 years of human time (the work of 69,000 people for one year). That's what is made possible by the aesthetics of inequality.      See also: Aubrey Strobel – The Art of Scarcity      We see, clearly then, that, in contrast to the way it is being advertised, the NFT currently puts the block and chain back in blockchain. Look again at Beeple's art, at its cold, dead and indifferent, even cheerfully indifferent landscapes and figures. Mankind's, ""self-alienation,"" says Benjamin, ""has reached such a degree that it can experience its own destruction as an aesthetic pleasure of the first order. This is the situation of politics which Fascism is rendering aesthetic."" I'm not saying Beeple's work is not ""of the moment.""      Nor am I blaming Beeple for the supervaluation of the NFT in question. But do we really want an aestheticized politics that says, ""We, the Beeple?"" Or ""Hail, Beeple""? Is the result we have been working for in crytpoeconomic design simply the capacity to create fetishized bits of code, capable of capturing 69,000 years of human life, and of delivering the value of those lifetimes to single individuals? Is that the cult crypto was built to serve? Where are the visionaries, coders and artists who will aim for something higher and more just?

CarbonDrop, the three-day auction of non-fungible token (NFT) artworks, raised a total of $6,662,054 from eight artists, kick-starting a monthlong awareness campaign for Open Earth, the climate accounting and technology project spun out of Yale University, and culminating on Earth Day (April 22).      It turned out the CarbonDrop auction would not be a repeat of an NFT sale hosted by Christie’s earlier this month when Justin Sun was outbid at the eleventh hour and failed to clinch Beeple’s “EVERYDAYS” artwork, which sold for a cool $69 million.      “I am so thrilled to have won Beeple’s art work OCEAN FRONT,” Sun, the founder of Tron, told CoinDesk via email. “Not only am I now the owner of an art piece from the most sought-after NFT artist of our time, but I get to support the leading agenda of our time, which is climate change.”    Read more: Artists Back ‘Green’ NFT Sale Citing Concerns Over Crypto’s Environmental Impact    NFT art, which typically uses the Ethereum blockchain to create title deeds to digitally rendered pictures and animation, has exploded in popularity, leading some artists to question the energy consumption of the underlying blockchain – hence the carbon-neutral fundraising auction for Open Earth.

A bitcoin ETF would likely oust Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) product from its dominant position by offering investors far lower fees and nixing the fund’s premium/discount discrepancies, negatives that have spooked some advisories from touching GBTC.  Rebuffing assertions that an armada of recent bitcoin fund products could challenge GBTC with more competitive fee structures, Sonnenshein said the trust’s 2% annual fee would remain.  He notched Grayscale’s collapsing premium to the forces of supply and demand. “There have been so many shares created that that has put some selling pressure on the stock itself, but ultimately [I] do not foresee this as a product issue.,"" he said.

Mina, a proof-of-stake protocol designed by O(1) Labs, announced the launch of its mainnet Tuesday, according to a release shared with CoinDesk.  Self-titled as a “lightweight,” Mina has a fixed blockchain size of 22 kilobytes, which it maintains by discarding blocks as they elapse. Usually blockchains retain every block mined. Its unorthodox design employs a technology called “zk-SNARKS,” most widely known for its use by Zcash, to preserve its transaction record without saving every block.      Through its SNARK-powered applications – or “Snapps” – Mina aims to “bring new possibilities for internet privacy and data security,” said O(1) Labs CEO Evan Shaprio in a statement.

42434025,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP7Clh,1616506200,State of Crypto: What’s Next for the OCC?,"The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) got involved in crypto in a big way last year under Acting Comptroller Brian Brooks. The future of this bank regulator is now up in the air.    You're reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Bank regulators and crypto  The narrative    The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is a major federal bank regulator, and the only one that has published guidance for cryptocurrency companies and banks that may be interested in interacting with cryptocurrencies. Under former Acting Comptroller Brian Brooks, who took office last summer, the OCC gave national banks permission (or at least a nod) to offer crypto custody services, conduct payments using stablecoins and work with crypto custodians. The OCC also made history by approving the first crypto company to become a national bank in the U.S.      The question is: What’s next? Brooks’ successor can either continue this crypto-friendly legacy or chart a totally different path.    Why it matters    Fiat on- and off-ramps are an important way for the general public to interact with cryptocurrencies. How the cryptocurrency industry intersects with the traditional financial sector therefore remains important. Furthermore, how major financial institutions look at crypto may also impact bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies’ prices.      President Joe Biden hasn’t yet announced who he wants leading the federal bank regulator, but his rumored OCC frontrunners are University of California – Irvine School of Law Professor Mehrsa Baradaran or California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) Commissioner Manuel Alvarez. Both have publicly discussed cryptocurrencies in the past. University of Michigan Dean of Public Policy Michael Barr was previously rumored to be the frontrunner, but more recent reporting suggests he’s no longer under consideration.    Breaking it down    Realistically, both Baradaran, who seems more likely to be nominated, and Alvarez are likely to focus initially on issues like COVID-19 relief and other priorities like financial inclusion should they lead the OCC. Still, both have discussed cryptocurrencies in public. While their comments are dated it's worth paying attention to their views, which suggest that if they do get involved with crypto, they're likely to be less friendly than former Comptroller Brooks.      Baradaran has testified before Congress about whether cryptocurrency can in and of itself facilitate financial inclusion. In a July 2019 hearing, she indicated the issue isn’t necessarily technological – rather, public policy should focus on issues like whether there are places where customers can use debit cards in what she described as banking deserts.      “There are many easier ways” than blockchain tools to provide financial access, she said at the time.      Baradaran, who is an advocate of postal banking, or allowing existing U.S. Postal Service offices to provide certain bank functions, reiterated this view in another hearing on the best ways to distribute COVID-19 relief last year.      “How do we get people to meet people where they’re at and make sure our solutions match the problem? The problem here is the banking deserts, it’s the unbanked and underbanked, and we have technology to meet those people and I think that’s critical at this juncture,” she said.      Prior to his role at the DFPI, Alvarez was the general counsel at Affirm, a financial technology company providing loans for purchase financing, meaning he has experience within the financial technology industry.      He also testified about regulatory issues and how cryptocurrency companies touch on them in a 2019 hearing in an official capacity. Speaking from his role as a consumer protection regulator, he said some of the key risks that any regulatory regime would face include theft, ensuring appropriate security, business continuity planning and transparency about fees.      These are issues his team had already begun working on, he said at the time.      “In the case of this emerging industry, I think the key is balance. It is important not to be so restrictive or prescriptive as to inadvertently stifle an emerging technology and industry out of California, but not so hands-off as to encourage strident actors that would take advantage of California consumers and investors,” he said.      Both Baradaran and Alvarez, like Securities and Exchange Commission Chair nominee Gary Gensler and rumored Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair nominee Chris Brummer, were on Biden’s transition team.      In any event, there may be other pressures that shape policy toward crypto – last December, House Financial Services Committee Chair Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) asked Biden to rescind all of Brooks' OCC guidance.    China’s blockchain dreams    China has been working on its central bank digital currency, the digital yuan (otherwise referred to as the DCEP), as well as its Blockchain-based Services Network (BSN) for a few years, and we’re starting to get a clearer picture of what China is trying to do.      We’re also starting to get a clearer view of how China plans to internationalize both BSN and DCEP. This could have a significant impact on the outside world. In fact, this is something incoming SEC Chair Gary Gensler once war-gamed alongside a number of former U.S. cabinet secretaries and researchers.      My colleagues explored China’s blockchain vision this week, examining how the country plans to grow its efforts beyond its national borders. The digital currency wing of the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), China’s central bank, is participating in a multinational cross-border payment pilot for digital currency trading platforms, for example, reports David Pan.      The government might be looking to work with other central banks to see how it can internationalize the digital yuan.      Meanwhile, BSN is being built as a censorable, centralized system that can support the same decentralized applications (dapps) that are operational on existing blockchain networks, Anna Baydakova reported. The plan is to expand BSN this year to different provinces and possibly different countries.      But BSN is very different from a decentralized, public blockchain. As Yifan He, the CEO of one of the firms behind BSN, said, “If they do something wrong we can delete the whole chain.”      Both BSN and DCEP have yet to launch at scale, but it’s clear that when they do, they may be able to immediately operate internationally.    Biden’s rule    While Securities and Exchange Commission Chair nominee Gary Gensler and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director nominee Rohit Chopra have been passed out of committee, the Senate has yet to schedule confirmation votes on either one.    Changing of the guard    Still no official word on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission either (or the OCC, for that matter).    Elsewhere:  Belarus Aiming for More Control Over Digital Economy, Crypto Exchanges: Report: You may recall my colleague Anna Baydakova reporting last year that protestors in Belarus were using bitcoin to send funds to each other after being locked out of the local financial ecosystem. It looks like President Alexander Lukashenko, who won under questionable circumstances, is now pushing to restrict crypto’s usage in the country.  Putin Says Russia Must Stop Illegal Cross-Border Crypto Transfers: Russian President Vladimir Putin is calling for the nation to “prevent illegal cross-border transfers of digital assets.”  Hawaiian House Dems Ask State Regulator to Reconsider Tough Rules for Crypto Firms: Lawmakers in the Hawaii legislature have proposed a bill that would ask the state financial regulator to change its asset reserve requirement, which presently forces crypto exchanges to hold an amount of fiat equivalent to the value of the crypto stored by the exchanges’ customers. It’s an unpopular (and expensive) requirement. Still, this is just a first step, and even if it’s passed it doesn’t force the regulator to actually make any changes, so I’m unclear on the full impact.  Bank of Japan Governor Stresses Need to Prepare for Digital Currency Launch: Haruhiko Kuroda, the governor of the Bank of Japan, said the central bank isn’t planning to launch a digital currency but it should still be prepared to do so if circumstances require, citing payment and settlement system efficiency and stability.  SEC Publishes VanEck’s Bitcoin ETF Application, Kicking Off Decision Clock: I’ve a particular fondness for bitcoin ETF stories; they’re basically how I got onto the regulatory beat. Anyway the SEC published VanEck/Cboe BZX’s 19b-4 on March 19, meaning the public can submit comments through April 9 and an initial decision is required by May 3.  Outside crypto:  Government Monitoring Won't Stop the Next SolarWinds Campaign, Experts Say: Cybersecurity reporter Kim Zetter has launched a Substack, and her inaugural issue looks at the SolarWinds hack from 2020, and how increased government surveillance of private digital networks (one suggestion that’s been made) might not actually prevent a future hack.

XRP, which is used in some of the company's payment products and Ripple helps develop, could be a ""neutral bridge"" between different currencies, bringing speed and efficiency to the process, according to the document titled, ""The Future of CBDCs.""  The white paper, published this week, identifies cross-border payments with CBDCs as receiving little attention from central banks, which largely target domestic use cases.  That's a ""short-sighted"" stance, according to Ripple, which says interoperable CBDCs could bring nations a competitive advantage, allowing commercial entities to make international trades.  ""Supporting immediate real-time foreign exchanges, as opposed to the current 3-5 day process will likely still require the need for prefunded currency accounts,"" the paper states.  A neutral bridge currency would then be needed to support liquidity markets to allow for effective movement of value between different CBDCs.  Ripple looks to be pitching itself to central banks researching and developing CBDCs amid its ongoing lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) over its allegedly illegal sales of XRP.

And, in perhaps a sign of the times, it involves a non-fungible token (NFT).      Algorithmic credit risk protocol Teller Finance’s limited alpha mainnet is now live on the Ethereum blockchain following a testnet earlier this year, the startup said Tuesday. The protocol links with traditional finance player Plaid and other data providers to bring real-time credit risk info onto the blockchain. And it's bootstrapping in a novel way – NFT liquidity provisioning.      Each “Fortune Teller” NFT token will not only depict various commissioned collectibles, but will be used for the protocol’s initial liquidity, the team said. Half of NFT sale funds will be placed into the protocol with yield paid out to NFT holders staking funds on Teller. The token will be needed in order to participate in the full alpha mainnet, which goes live April 5.      “With our NFT system, we’ve found a way to supply the protocol’s liquidity and reward our early community members while simultaneously offering a unique access mechanism for the early alpha,” Teller Finance CEO Ryan Berkun said in a statement. “Teller NFT holders will gain immediate APY benefits, and will also have access to longer-term benefits we will reveal at a later date.”    Read more: Fintech Giant Plaid Has a Hidden Passion for DeFi    As reported by CoinDesk, Teller Finance has worked with fintech giant Plaid to integrate real-time credit scores into DeFi from over 2,000 financial services. The protocol plans on decentralizing its governance over time as data providers begin natively lending through the application, Berkun said in a Telegram message to CoinDesk.      The integration with the TradFi world is a markedly different step than other DeFi protocols also solving the credit conundrum. Lending protocol Aave, for example, released a credit delegation feature last August that relied more on cryptographic assumptions than incumbent banking systems. Berkun said Teller Finance sees Aave or other DeFi lending protocols as complements, and not competitors.      “Teller is focused on enabling credit risk assessment for DeFi,” he said. “We see ourselves becoming a protocol for other DeFi markets to launch atop or integrate. Maple Finance and Aave are partners in our eyes, who can leverage Teller to bring data based risk assessment into their markets.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | MINING,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/03/23/teller-finances-mainnet-launch-puts-nfts-to-work-but-not-how-you-expect,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/95638ad626b76574784da81622d97dc66f0e20da-1500x994.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitfinex said Tuesday it has integrated Copper’s “ClearLoop” settlement and clearing network, which removes the need for institutional customers to move digital tokens from a secure cold wallet into an exchange's hot wallet.  The integration of the network is intended to reduce the time it takes for investors to make deposits and withdraw funds, as well as mitigate counterparty risk by holding funds in Copper's segregated, institutional-grade custody accounts.  “Our platform’s relationship with Copper is driving uptake of digital token trading among hedge fund and asset managers worldwide, transforming how institutional customers engage with digital tokens, by providing market-leading custody and trading solutions,” said Paolo Ardoino, CTO at Bitfinex.  Bitfinex said it has collaborated with Zug-based infrastructure firm Market Synergy for “institutional standard cryptocurrency connectivity” and thus will be better able to serve those high-frequency trading firms looking for exposure to crypto.

42434028,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP7Cph,1616498882,Bitcoin's Risk-Reward Ratio Suggests Bull Run Has Plenty of Scope to Continue,"Despite seeing its biggest drop for a month in the last 24 hours, bitcoin's bull run is likely to continue.      That's the suggestion of blockchain data showing the cryptocurrency is still an attractive bet for existing holders and prospective buyers.      Bitcoin's ""reserve risk"" metric measures the risk-reward ratio of investment based on long-term holders' confidence relative to the price at any given point of time, and is currently seen at 0.008. That's well short of highs above 0.02 seen during the bull market frenzies of December 2017, December 2013, and June 2011, according to blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.      The low current level suggests confidence is still high relative to the cryptocurrency's price. Essentially, the risk/reward is skewed attractively even after the cryptocurrency's six-fold rally in the past 5.5 months.      ""The incentive for long-term holders to sell is still relatively low when compared to past bull markets,"" Jeff Rose, founder and CEO of Vailshire Capital Management, tweeted Monday. ""This metric suggests the current bull market still has a long way to run in terms of price increases.""      The bullish signal is consistent with the positive picture painted by other on-chain indicators, such as the market value relative to realized value ratio.      Bitcoin's latest bull market commenced a year ago after the reserve risk fell into the buy zone (green area) below 0.002. Since then, the cryptocurrency has charted an 11-fold rally.      The risk-reward ratio will be deemed unattractive once the indicator hits the red zone above 0.02.      Reserve risk is calculated by dividing bitcoin's price at any point in time by the ""HODL Bank,"" as detailed by Glassnode, which represents the opportunity cost of holding an asset. ""Each day a coin is held, the owner defers the ability to exchange it for its cash value,"" according to Glassnode.      At press time, bitcoin is trading nearly 1.2% higher on the day at $54,738, having defended support at $53,000 earlier in Tuesday, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      ""We have seen roughly under $1 billion in liquidations in the past 24 hours. However, the market continues to hold its $53,000 support,"" said Matthew Dibb, COO and co-founder of Stack Funds. ""There is an expectation of a deeper pullback to $47,500 if we confidently close below [the $53,000] level.""

Prior to joining the exchange, Endo was commissioner of the Financial Services Agency (FSA) from 2018 to 2020, supervising Japan's financial and banking industry, including the cryptocurrency sector.  He had held other roles at the FSA since 2014, and before that a number of senior positions within regulatory bodies stretching back to 1988.  In an interview with Reuters in 2018, Endo said he had, “no intention to curb (the crypto industry) excessively,” and aims to strike a balance between safeguarding clients and promoting technological innovation.

42434011,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP7CJh,1616488802,Crypto Exchange OKEx Korea to Close as New AML Rules Come Into Force,"The South Korean arm of the cryptocurrency exchange OKEx has decided to shut up shop rather than attempt to navigate revised regulatory hurdles that come into effect on Thursday.    According to a report by CoinDesk Korea on Tuesday, the cryptocurrency exchange has earmarked April 7 as the last dayhttps://okex.co.kr/kr/view/notice/900006264263 users can withdraw their digital assets and fiat currency.    A spokesperson of the exchange told CoinDesk Korea the local currency market would become too difficult to navigate due to new anti-money laundering (AML) safeguards for cryptocurrency businesses.      “In addition to several other factors, actual profits from our Korean operation don’t add up to much, so we decided to cut our losses,” said the spokesperson.      Under the revised Financial Transaction Reports Act, virtual asset service providers (VASPs) must undergo compliance inspections and verify customer identities – something the exchange said it is unwilling to do in this case, according to the report.      The legislation also stipulates that the providers are required to file suspicious transaction reports to the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit and are answerable to the Financial Services Commission (FCS).      The new legislation provides a six-month grace period to firms engaging in services related to cryptocurrency.      ""Up until now we’ve provided most of our services with fiat on-ramps, but forming a bank partnership (for real-name accounts) is realistically out of reach,"" said the spokesperson.      In November 2020, the FSC began undergoing legal amendments to legislation that made it mandatory for VASPS within the country to report the names of their customers.      The move is in line with intergovernmental money-laundering watchdog the Financial Action Task Force and its request to its over 200 member nations to help them prevent money laundering.      CoinDesk Korea reporters Inseon Chung and Felix Lim assisted in the translation from Korean to English.      OKEx Korea previously announced on March 18 it would cease operating in the local currency market until March 25 when the revised legislation comes into effect. It has since only been operating markets in bitcoin, ether and tether.

Bitcoin (BTC) was trading around $54,680 as of 12:50 UTC (8:50 p.m. ET), after falling late Monday to around $53,715, the lowest since March 16.  The largest cryptocurrency fell 5.8% over the previous 24 hours, for its largest daily decline since Feb. 23, according to Bitstamp exchange data. Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $53,795.15-$58,407.62 (CoinDesk 20).  BTC's four-hour chart shows seller volume has been building alongside a falling price, a bearish signal for market technicians.    The drop below $55,000 comes as cryptocurrency fund inflows have been on the decline, down by roughly 58% to $99 million last week.      Trading volume was also strong from sellers on Monday, with the largest four-hour print by the bears in over a week.      Ki Young Ju, CEO of the South Korea analysis firm CryptoQuant, says blockchain data shows there's ""not enough buying power from stablecoins and U.S. dollar spot inflows"" to drive prices vastly higher.
