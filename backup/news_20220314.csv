This price point was critical for bulls to hold and ever since bears dragged the price below it, it has been a continuous display of dips and crashes. For a cryptocurrency like Ethereum, there are resistance and support levels that are very important for the digital asset. One of those support levels sits just above $2,500. So far, the digital asset has managed to maintain above this point. This shows that bulls are mounting significant support. However, with momentum falling and selling pressure up, it remains shaky at this point. For Ethereum to maintain any semblance of balance towards a bull rally, it must beat its next resistance point. This now sits above $2,600, but what is the price doing? 50-Day SMA Continues To Resist For the short term, there are some important milestones that Ethereum must beat to secure a bullish trend. One of these is the 50-day simple moving average. This points to the average where investors have been purchasing the cryptocurrency for the last couple of weeks.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin and ether didn't move much from a day ago.  Insights: A Taipei-based executive sees GameFi as a way to build better games.  Technician's take: BTC's sideways price range could result in higher volatility over the next two weeks.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $39,971 +0.9%  Ether (ETH): $2,557 -0.3%  Top Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Chainlink LINK +1.0% Computing Bitcoin BTC +1.0% Currency Solana SOL +0.7% Smart Contract Platform  Top Losers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Stellar XLM −2.6% Smart Contract Platform Polygon MATIC −2.5% Smart Contract Platform Filecoin FIL −1.6% Computing  Markets  S&P 500: 4,173 -0.7%  DJIA: 32,925 0%  Nasdaq: 12,581 -2.0%  Gold: $1,950 -1.8%  Most major cryptos fall  Bitcoin, ether and most other cryptocurrencies spent much of Monday in the red as more bad news flowed from Ukraine.  At one point bitcoin was trading at about $39,000, slightly up over the previous 24 hours. Ether was selling at just over $2,550, off slightly over the same period. Other major cryptos in the CoinDesk top 20 by market capitalization also fell, although Terra's luna and and Axie Infinity (AXS) were among the exceptions. Trading was light as investors seemed inclined to wait out events later in the week, including a decision by the U.S. central bank's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) on the first of what many observers believe will be several interest rate hikes this year to quash raging inflation.  ""Cryptos across the board are in for a choppy period as investors await developments with Russia-Ukraine talks and if the Fed gives a clear path for interest rates that could possibly lead to a deeper bond market selloff,"" OANDA Americas Senior Market Analyst Edward Moya wrote in an email.  Analysts remain divided about whether crypto and equity markets are correlated assets, but the two have seemed to operate along similar wavelengths in recent weeks. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell about 2% on Monday and the S&P 500 was off slightly.  Meanwhile, the Economic and Monetary Affairs committee of the European Parliament decided to exclude a proposed rule that could have banned proof-of-work systems such as bitcoin throughout the European Union, but the vote seemed to have little impact on crypto prices.  In Ukraine, Russia escalated its bombardment of the capital Kyiv as the Kremlin remained unmoved by calls from most of the international community to halt its unprovoked attack. Russian forces stopped a convoy of supplies for the besieged Black Sea port of Mariupol, which is facing food and other shortages. Ukrainian and Russian representatives are scheduled to meet again on Tuesday to discuss a ceasefire. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky will address the U.S. Congress remotely in an effort to convince lawmakers to provide more military support.  Moya noted optimistically that cryptos had gotten a boost from Tesla CEO and crypto influencer Elon Musk, who tweeted that although owning quality stocks or a home was good during high inflationary times, he would not be selling bitcoin, ether or doge.  ""Musk's tweet is a reminder that a lot of long-term hodlers are out there and that bitcoin will likely see strong support ahead of the bumpy path that lies ahead as the U.S. Federal Reserve starts raising interest rates,"" Moya wrote.  Insights  We hear a lot about GameFi as a path to prosperity for the developing world. This is a nice narrative for VCs wanting some ESG [environmental social, governance] points for helping the poor, but the data doesn’t hold up. Many of the players sponsored by gaming guilds in the Philippines make less collecting Axies than they would working at Jollibee's because their earnings are under the country’s minimum wage.  But let’s not get too cynical about this. We’re still early in the GameFi era. It has to be useful for something, right?  Gaming’s creativity problem has been well documented. The industry is a publicly traded, multibillion-dollar titan and sequels are a stalwart source of revenue. Shareholders need stable returns, and another sequel is the easiest way to accomplish this. With so much consolidation in the market, companies are hard-pressed to take a creative risk where the financial benefit is uncertain. This environment differs from the early days of console wars.  “The console wars were the most interesting time, because everyone’s trying to outperform each other and find creative ways to make interesting games that capture attention,” said See Wan Toong, the chief technology officer of Red Door Digital, a Taipei-based studio building out Web 3 games. “But now it seems to be consolidated and has become a more corporate, money-making thing rather than more creative. I think everyone’s trying to survive or trying to be very conservative in their approach.”  Starting in Singapore  Toong’s gaming career started in Singapore, which he calls a gaming desert because of the lack of industry and development, but ended up in Taiwan after a brief stint in Europe because of Taipei’s balance of the low cost of living, artistic talent pool and geographic proximity to other hubs. Along the way, he spent time at EA and a few major regional studios.  As the console wars faded, the Massively Multiplayer Online game boom grew, and Toong sees parallels involving the MMOs, the mid-2000s and the rise of Web3 gaming (remember ""South Park’s"" Emmy-winning ""Make Love not Warcraft""?).  MMOs – the development of one spurred his return toTaiwan from abroad – had an in-game economy and monthly subscriptions.  These were predictable sources of income that executives liked, but not tied to a predictable formula of, as he called it: “I have x amount of consoles, I have x amount of players and I have x amount of fans for my IP, so hence I’m going to make x amount of money.”  But eventually, that formula won out and MMOs got lost in a wave of consolidations.  This return of in-game economies is happening with GameFi – slowly but surely. There’s not yet a creative, GameFi masterpiece similar to World of Warcraft, but the model of an in-game economy is a good cure for sequelitis because there’s money to earn in a different way than churning out endless sequels of a gigantic franchise.  The Flappy Bird era  First, however, GameFi must get past the Flappy Bird era.  For those that don’t remember, Flappy Bird was one of the first mobile games to go viral. It was riddled with bad gameplay and blatant plagiarism with some calling it an “ad-congested mess of a game that is insanely addicting.” Eventually, its creator killed it off to preserve his own sanity after it became a sleeper cult hit.  “I want to say that Flappy Bird is a very, very good thing. It was successful, and helped bring in a period of transition to a different platform [of mobile games],” Toong said.  Toong doesn’t want to call Axie Infinity the Flappy Bird of this era, only saying that after a while, people might think about Axie Infinity as an important part of the history of the Web 3.  Remember, Flappy Bird didn’t survive. It died a quick death (later to have a sort of reincarnation via knockoffs).  Many gamers online have equated the current quality of GameFi to that of Nintendo’s original NES from the mid-1980s – pixelated and linear, just like what Flappy Bird was in 2013. Many have also criticized the quality of Axie Infinity’s gameplay.  The MMOs World of Warcraft and Everquest were creative masterpieces that made their studios fortunes. Toong and Red Door Digital hope to do the same, but whether they will remains unclear.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Rangebound Above $35K-$37K Support; Resistance at $40K  Bitcoin (BTC) remains in a tight trading range, although buyers maintained support at $37,500 over the weekend. Still, the cryptocurrency faces strong resistance beyond $40,000, which could limit additional upside over the short term.  BTC was roughly flat over the past 24 hours, and is up 2% over the past week.  The downward sloping 100-day moving average has kept the four-month downtrend intact. Recent sideways trading, however, could result in volatile price swings over the next two weeks.  Buyers will need to hold support above $35,000-$37,000 in order to preserve the long-term uptrend.

The license is Binance’s first in the Middle East/North Africa (MENA) region.  “The license from Bahrain is a milestone in our journey to being fully licensed and regulated around the world,” Changpeng Zhao, founder and CEO of Binance, wrote in a press announcement.

In 2021, Binance came under fire from regulators in a number of countries, including the United Kingdom and Japan.

Khalid Humaidan, CEO of the Bahrain Economic Development Board, wrote: “Team Bahrain has built a world-class infrastructure to support the fast-growing blockchain and crypto industry, with robust regulations. … Collaboration with industry leaders such as Binance will further enhance our mission to establish the Kingdom of Bahrain as a leading business hub.”  Read more: Binance in Talks to Obtain Dubai License Amid Middle East Push: Report",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | BNB,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/14/binance-granted-a-crypto-asset-service-provider-license-from-bahrains-central-bank,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fb5bc6bbf3b968360bfed023026f0d849364d56c-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410912,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtGHk,1647292001,Wasabi Wallet’s CoinJoin Coordinator to Blacklist Certain Bitcoin Transactions,"zkSNACKs, the company behind the Wasabi wallet, will bar certain bitcoin (BTC) transactions from its service that facilitates privacy-enhancing transactions known as CoinJoins, according to a tweet under the Wasabi Wallet Twitter handle.  A Wasabi developer said the move was necessary to prevent hackers and scammers from using the service and to keep the company out of unspecified “trouble” (presumably the legal kind). The move underscores the challenges faced by centralized companies that provide services built to facilitate interaction with a decentralized ecosystem. It also serves as a reminder that fungibility – the quality that makes any unit of a currency interchangeable with another – is hard to maintain with bitcoin’s auditability.  Wasabi is known for its mechanism that helps to coordinate CoinJoins between different users. CoinJoins are a method of mixing coins to protect users’ privacy on a public ledger. Users send their coins (input transactions) into a sort of pool where they are mixed with other users’ coins. Then they receive an equal value of bitcoins (output transactions) at the other end. The connection between the input and output transactions is thus obfuscated and hard for blockchain detectives to trace.  It is important to note that CoinJoining is not unique to Wasabi. It is a type of send transaction that is used by the Bitcoin protocol itself. CoinJoins are, by nature, decentralized and peer-to-peer. But it can be tricky to use ConJoin and even harder to find pools of other people who are willing to participate. The coordinator service that operates Wasabi Wallet, called zkSNACKS, provides an easy way for Bitcoin CoinJoin users to find each other and “coordinate” their transactions.  What it means  Wasabi’s zkSNACKS coordinator does just that: Its code coordinates transactions. It doesn’t actually hold user keys, nor can it actually see what is happening with the transactions once they are in the coordinator pool or trace the origins of the outputs on the other end.  What it can do, however, is see where inputs are coming from. Because zkSNACKS is a centralized service, it can prevent input transactions sent by certain addresses from entering the pool and CoinJoining with other inputs.  According to a tweet from Wasabi developer Rafe:  We are trying to protect the company and the project by minimizing the amount of these hackers and scammers using the coordinator and getting us in trouble.  Does this mean CoinJoining is ‘broken’?  No.  Wasabi Wallet will continue to operate using the zkSNACKS coordinator, albeit with a certain level of restrictions now in effect. Although it now excludes blacklisted addresses, zkSNACKs will remain operational for all other users who want to maintain their bitcoin privacy.  The wallet’s new screening measures have prompted other CoinJoin-enabling platforms to assess their own practices.  Samourai Wallet, for example, also uses a coordinator, Whirlpool, to facilitate CoinJoining among its users. It noted in a Twitter thread that coordinators simply “pass data packets from one connected client to another”:  Furthermore, because CoinJoin is an open-source protocol, restrictions imposed by one centralized coordinator do not spell the end for CoinJoins and the bitcoin privacy they protect. As privacy advocate Matt Odell pointed out in a Twitter thread, “Anyone can run a competing coordinator that does not do this blacklisting and users can switch to it.”  JoinMarket, for example, recently released a more user-friendly interface for its CoinJoin-enabling platform, though its new UI is still a work in progress. According to data site Bitcoin KPI, volume on JoinMarket appears to be significantly higher than on Wasabi and Samourai’s Whirlpool combined.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | REGULATION | WALLET,Christie Harkin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/03/14/wasabi-wallets-coinjoin-coordinator-to-blacklist-certain-bitcoin-transactions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/edb14149dbe2857c4b2bec1b234b1dd79dbc8dc0-4000x3000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

On Monday, a proposal that could have required cryptocurrencies like bitcoin to shift to more environmentally friendly mechanisms was rejected in a European Union (EU) parliament committee vote. The proposal was added to a draft of the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) framework last week, which was met with a heavy backlash from crypto advocates worldwide.  There was little market reaction following the EU rejection, although some alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) such as dogecoin (DOGE) pared earlier gains. Meanwhile, bitcoin experienced less selling pressure than altcoins on Monday, suggesting lower appetite for risk among crypto traders.  In traditional markets, the S&P 500 extended losses on Monday while gold and oil prices tumbled. Some traders expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to acknowledge soaring energy prices, which could lead to slower economic growth, during the conclusion of their two-day policy meeting on March 15-16.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Bitcoin's trading volume across major exchanges declined to its lowest level since Feb. 19 over the past weekend. That could indicate some caution among traders ahead of the Fed meeting this week.  Geopolitical uncertainty also contributed to the recent slowdown in trading activity, which is reflected in blockchain data. So far this year demand among bitcoin holders has flattened, reflecting the ""impact of global macro uncertainty on investor sentiment, with weaker BTC accumulation taking place as a result,"" Glassnode, a crypto data firm, wrote in a blog post.  Further, the narrow trading range between $35,000 and $40,000 could result in higher volatility over the next two weeks, according to some technical indicators.  Less bearish sentiment  The put/call ratio continued to decline over the past few days, indicating less bearish sentiment among bitcoin options traders. The ratio is currently at the lowest level in a month, albeit still above the Jan. 19 trough.  ""Despite the looming interest rate increase expected from the Fed this week, the BTC put/call ratio continues to decline from an early February high,"" Fundstrat Global Advisors wrote in a Monday email. ""This decline in the overall ratio might indicate that investors are starting to position for longer-term risk.""  Altcoin roundup  Ethereum staking protocol Swell raises $3.75M as locked ETH tops $26B: Ethereum reached a major milestone last week in its highly anticipated transition to proof-of-stake, with 10 million ETH (about $26 billion) now locked in the Ethereum 2.0 staking contract.

42411490,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOS2V,1647290636,"Jack Dorsey, Block and the Perils of Making Crypto User-Friendly","Last July, payments startup/giant (can you be both?) Square announced that it would be developing a hardware cryptocurrency wallet. The prospect of a wallet designed by the same folks who build the world’s fastest-growing point-of-sale technology promised exciting advances in ease of use and adoption. And that was months before Jack Dorsey flipped the tech world table by resigning from Twitter to focus on Square (now Block) full time, even further upping the stakes.  But, for perhaps the first time in Dorsey’s yearslong flirtation with Bitcoin (“crypto,” not so much), there’s a significant disconnect between his plans and crypto long-timers’ preferences. In a Friday blog post, Block announced that its hardware wallet would make fingerprint identification the primary and default method for users to access their funds. Block does say it will “evaluate additional access methods that customers could opt into.”  At least in the case of consumer goods like cellphones, the motivation for adding biometric access control is usually simple convenience, but the ultimate implications could be dire. Another Web 2.0 holdover, Sam Altman, a former president of Y Combinator, a firm that helps funds tech startups, introduced a token called Worldcoin over the summer of 2021, and critics including Edward Snowden pointed out that the scheme would risk exposing users’ biometric data with potentially severe and permanent consequences for victims. When the ruthless capitalists at the American Enterprise Institute think your plan is anti-social, you know you’re in trouble.  To be fair, the Block plan is different from Worldcoin’s in crucial ways that make it more defensible. In part because the planned wallet is a single-user device, it will be able to create and store its biometric credentials locally, as your phone does. Worldcoin, by contrast, seemed likely to require a centralized database of iris-scan hashes, an absolute five-alarm fire of poor security architecture.  But even local processing and storage is a real risk – ultimately, no local data that can be reached via the internet should ever be considered truly secure. And the literally lifelong consequences of a compromised fingerprint make even the remotest exposure worth seriously interrogating.  Equally worrisome, making a fingerprint the main way of authorizing a crypto wallet could mean less emphasis on private key management. That could introduce an added risk vector for users: if your hardware wallet is the only home of your private keys, and that hardware is controlled by a fingerprint, the risk of losing all your money just went up rather than down.  Block seems well aware of the risks here, based on both the content and timing of the announcement. “We're aware of limitations [of fingerprint security] we'll need to design around,” the announcement states. And in the communications business, Fridays are when you drop news you don’t want anyone to pay too much attention to – reporters are largely finishing up their assignments and looking forward to a blissful weekend. So it’s a good bet Block was seeking to minimize blowback here.  All that said, Block is trying to thread an extremely tricky needle, and its current plans deserve a thoughtful rather than knee-jerk response. The announcement post makes clear the priority was to design a wallet that can be used “securely, but with ease,” balancing user experience with safety.  “We don’t want to force new behaviors on customers with a novel interface on the hardware component of the wallet we’re building,” the announcement continues. “Instead, making the mobile application the center of the experience will lead to familiar, intuitive interactions.”  For better or worse, we’re very used to using fingerprint unlocks on smaller devices. So using them makes absolute sense from a Silicon Valley hardware designer’s perspective. The presumption that something should be a mass-market product, ideally usable by even the slowest kids on the bus, is baked into the business models and culture of even relatively agile entities like Block.  Read more: David Z. Morris - Jack Dorsey Takes Square Deep Down the Bitcoin Rabbit Hole  The logic also, however, aligns with many calls within the crypto industry to prioritize making user experience better and more intuitive, not just for wallets but also for decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and everything else. The problem, as crypto and security experts including MetaMask’s Taylor Monahan have pointed out, is that a smooth user experience is almost inextricable from security risks. In fact, she specifically cites another “ease-of-use” feature that led people to not save their private keys properly. It's about a feature of an early version of MyCrypto/MEW, the wallet Monahan built before joining Metamask recently. Specifically, the feature was an automatic download/display of all the wallet information that people apparently forgot to write down pretty often.  Ultimately, there will eventually be crypto products that strike the right balance between security and usability. But frankly, I think companies rushing in that direction now are shortchanging the entire ecosystem by de-emphasizing education.

Currently, NEARUSDT is below a double top at $12. Past Performance Near Protocol traders may be hopeful, expecting NEAR prices to rip higher and clear immediate resistance levels. However, from the daily chart, sellers are in control. The coin is down six percent in the last trading day and at breakeven versus the USDT on the previous trading week. There could be elements of strength. However, NEARUSDT prices are still capped inside a descending wedge. NEAR Technical Analysis The failure of NEAR bulls to close above the resistance trend line and the descending wedge at $12 is a pointer to weakness. The path of least resistance is southwards in the near term. Notice that prices are also recoiling from the double top marking March 2022 highs even though NEARUSDT prices are still within the March 1 and 9 bull bars. A close above $12 confirms buying pressure, setting the base for another leg up towards $14 and $20 as prices bottom up. On the flip side, more profound losses below $9.5 and the support trend line could trigger a selloff, pushing NEAR towards December 2021 lows of $6.6. What to Expect of NEAR? Despite the optimism, bulls are struggling against a wave of selling pressure.

UPDATE (March 25th, 11:36 UTC): EU's MiCA Bill Moves Forward Without Bitcoin Limiting Provision  On Monday, the EU parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee voted 31-4 in favor of a new draft of the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) framework, with 23 abstentions. The framework broadly captures the issuance and trading of cryptocurrencies, and promises to make it easier for crypto firms to expand throughout the EU's 27 member states by facilitating a ""passportable"" license that would be valid between countries.  ""Finally, the agreed text includes measures against market manipulation and to prevent money laundering, terrorist financing and other criminal activities,"" said an official statement on Monday's vote.  The committee earlier voted to remove a provision that sought to limit the use of cryptocurrencies that rely on the energy-intensive consensus mechanism known as proof-of-work. The rule could have, in effect, banned the popular cryptocurrency bitcoin (BTC) across the EU.  Instead, the committee voted in favor of an alternative provision that would require the European Commission, which is the body in charge of proposing new legislation, to come up with a ""a legislative proposal to include in the EU taxonomy (a classification system) for sustainable activities any crypto-asset mining activities that contribute substantially to climate change, by 1 January 2025.""  This provision was adopted with the goal of reducing the ""high carbon footprint"" of cryptocurrencies. Proof-of-work has come under heavy criticism from regulators and politicians around the world over energy concerns. Some EU leaders are concerned that renewable energy may be channeled into sustaining cryptocurrencies like bitcoin instead of national use.  European parliament members ""stress that other industries (e.g., the video games and entertainment industry, as well as data centers) also consume energy resources that are not climate-friendly. They call for the Commission to work on legislation addressing these issues across different sectors,"" the statement said.

These words were clearly confirmed by the XMR cryptocurrency during the trading week of 7 March. While most cryptocurrencies are consolidating in narrow ranges, XMR has organized a price shot by 70% for the week. Sellers managed to take the situation under temporary control and kept the critical range of $180. However, after the closing of the weekly candle on 7 March, we will not see an active counterattack by sellers, as is the case after a powerful false break in the big timeframe. Instead, we see a new attempt by buyers to squeeze in and take control of the $180 mark. https://www.tradingview.com/x/BIkSIQJe/ The XMR price growth stop at around $283 clearly showed where the main resistance from sellers is. Given the dynamics of the cryptocurrency market, the high probability of USDT dominance fall, and the anonymity of the XMR cryptocurrency - the probability of re-testing the mark of $283 is the highest. However, for such a positive scenario, buyers need to take control of the $180 mark during the week of 14 March. Closing the current weekly candle below this mark will indicate the weakness of buyers and the beginning of the XMR price fall to $145 to begin with.

Lummis’ New Crypto Bill,"Kevin O’Leary made himself a household name as a co-host of “Shark Tank,” where budding entrepreneurs make their pitches to a panel of investors. On March 9, it was “Mr. Wonderful’s” turn to make a case for crypto before U.S. legislators in Washington, D.C.  The O’Shares Exchange-Traded Fund chairman met with senators, representatives and their staffers on Capitol Hill to push for Sen. Cynthia Lummis’ (R-Wyo.) Responsible Financial Innovation Act, he said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Monday. According to Sen. Lummis, her bill aims to fully integrate digital assets into the U.S. financial system.  The bill comes at a time when Congress is grappling with a potential framework for digital asset oversight, although discussions on the issue are starting to pick up pace. Last week, President Joe Biden unveiled a long-awaited executive order on digital assets, pushing agencies and departments to craft guidance on the industry. The order was a first-of-its-kind approach by the government to digital assets.  Sen. Lummis, long a bitcoin (BTC) hodler, has been working on the “comprehensive” bill since at least 2021. A senior aide for the senator told CoinDesk in December the bill would call for the creation of a crypto regulatory body, as well as federal rules for stablecoins, consumer protection provisions, updated taxation guidance, and the establishment of a self-regulatory organization (SRO).  The 160-plus page bill represents an attempt, O’Leary said, to get some agreement on cryptocurrency regulation from both sides on Capitol Hill.  “This is one of the few bipartisan activities going on on the Hill right now,” he said. “Many senators on a bipartisan basis are interested in having this in their states.”  O’Leary said his meeting with lawmakers last week also presented an opportunity for crypto education.  “They’re asking me about how I invested in [cryptocurrency] and what my premise of investing in this was, and what I could and couldn’t do from a compliance point of view,” O’Leary said.  Even though the Responsible Financial Innovation Act is likely not going to go before Congress until after the midterm elections in November – if at all – the bill is good news, said the Canadian investor, because it could provide some much-needed regulatory clarity and encourage institutional investors to come into the industry.  “When policy comes in, you’ll see a trillion dollars move into this market,” he said, adding: “We can finally embrace the idea that any digital currency isn’t going to be legislated out of existence.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/14/shark-tanks-oleary-lobbies-congress-for-sen-lummis-new-crypto-bill,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

Last month, the MiCA framework released a draft of its proposed regulations for cryptocurrency. One specific provision of the document suggested a ban on digital assets that depend on ecologically unsustainable consensus procedures throughout the union&apos;s 27 member states, with the restriction taking effect immediately beginning in January 2025. The draft was met with considerable resistance from the cryptocurrency industry, which led to an amendment in the proposed legislation over the weekend. Although the framework was amended and considerably modified from the original over the weekend, it still contained clauses that would restrict the trade and usage of proof-of-work cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Bitcoin throughout Europe. Why Did the EU Parliament Propose A Ban On The PoW Mechanism? Proof-of-work is the consensus process that underpins prominent cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH).

Cardano blockchain uses the proof-of-stake mechanism which consumes less amount of energy when compared to the proof-of-work mechanism. To ensure the durability of all processes in the blockchain, it ensures that all suggestions for upgrades are challenged through peer-to-peer review. Its recent upgrade to Alonzo hard fork had ensured that users can develop and deploy decentralized applications (Dapps) in its blockchain, which is more than 50-100 times more efficient than other blockchains after it had the Shelley upgrade. What is Cardano (ADA)? Cardano is an open-source blockchain that was created in 2017 and named after a 16th-century Italian polymath, Gerolamo Cardano. Its native token was named after Lovelace Ada who was assumed to be the first Computer programmer in the world. It was founded by Charles Hoskinson who was a co-founder of Ethereum blockchain before establishing it. The essence of the Cardano blockchain is to ensure that decentralized applications and smart contracts can be created with ease by individuals with little skill in programming. Cardano blockchain ensures that credentials are protected, counterfeit goods are discovered and agricultural products are converted to finished products from their raw state.

Finally, buyers have shown interest in this cryptocurrency and significantly slowed down the price fall. If you look at how easily the weekly candle from 17 January tested the range of $150, now the situation has changed drastically. Sellers needed three times as much time and volumes to perform the same operation as during the week of 17 January. In addition, the body of each subsequent weekly candle, starting from 14 February, was getting smaller. As a result, sellers failed to update the local low from 17 January and the EGLD price remained in the global growth channel. The trading week on 7 March closed above the opening price.

42411507,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOSgB,1647282113,The First NFT Monopoly,"This past fall, I wrote about the idea that, while much of the rhetoric around cryptocurrencies has to do with “decentralization” as a guiding ethos, the NFT sector is in fact already extremely centralized.  Specifically, it’s centralized on the sales side. According to data from the blockchain analytics company DappRadar, the vast majority of all non-fungible token sales volume is concentrated on two platforms: OpenSea, the incumbent backed by venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, and LooksRare, a scrappy outsider that emerged a few months ago. But because the vast majority of sales volume on LooksRare comes from “wash trades” – that is, traders selling themselves their own NFTs in an attempt to take advantage of the platform’s token rewards system – it’s safe to say that what you might call real NFT trades are happening almost entirely on OpenSea.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  And although that’s still very much the case, the NFT market has recently begun a kind of second-order centralization in the realm of content.  On Friday evening, Yuga Labs, the company behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection, announced it had acquired the “brands, copyright in the art and other IP rights” for two NFT projects from the developer Larva Labs: CryptoPunks, the pixelated mug shots that helped elevate NFTs into the public consciousness last year, and Meebits, their 3D counterparts.  CryptoPunks were the world’s most valuable NFTs for most of 2021, until Bored Apes dethroned them.  On one level, the acquisition makes sense. Larva Labs has always been just two guys, John Watkinson and Matt Hall. They created CryptoPunks back in 2017, essentially as an experiment. As hype built around their project in 2020 and 2021, the duo kept on working their day jobs at the Google Creative Lab in Manhattan, where their co-workers wondered why they weren’t off capitalizing on the crypto gold rush. They kept on experimenting, launching Meebits last May, but they never really decided to make CryptoPunks their full-time focus.  As time went on, this hands-off approach to the CryptoPunks' intellectual property began to annoy some CryptoPunk investors. Today, mostly thanks to the success of the Bored Ape Yacht Club business model, the expectation for major NFT collections is that they will function like online social clubs, hosting lavish invite-only concerts and in-person meetups, as well as spinoff NFT projects with the potential to spawn their own communities. Bored Ape holders were signing with major record labels and agencies – where were the equivalent perks for CryptoPunks?  The implication was that CryptoPunks didn’t need that social apparatus. For the Bored Ape Yacht Club, the “community” element has always been a key part of the value proposition – you’re supposed to wear those hoodies, attend those parties. CryptoPunks were initially conceived as pure collectibles; organic speculation, rather than a coordinated marketing campaign, was what made the price go up.  Watkinson and Hall managed to capture lighting in a bottle. Meanwhile, Yuga Labs has reportedly been in talks with Andreessen Horowitz about funding that would value it at $5 billion. The undisclosed sum collected by Larva Labs may have been too good to resist.  The result is that the two most valuable NFT collections are now owned by a single company we know relatively little about. We only just learned the names of its executive leadership last month, in a report from BuzzFeed News (Yuga Labs’ two core founders had previously been pseudonymous, and put up a fight after what they saw as a “dangerous” act of journalism on the part of BuzzFeed).  Larva Labs remains an independent company and retains the rights to its other major NFT project, Autoglyphs. And Yuga Labs has said it doesn’t have any immediate plans to replicate the Bored Apes business model with CryptoPunks, which a press release characterized as a “historic collection.”  Instead, Yuga Labs plans to add “utility” to the collection. “Utility” is an increasingly nebulous buzzword in the NFT sector, and tends to refer to perks for investors down the line. If your NFT unlocks access to a private Discord channel, or to a pre-approved green list for another NFT mint, or a special 3D item on a metaverse platform – broadly speaking, that’s “utility.” (Utility also has the potential to bring certain tokens under scrutiny from the SEC, since it can make NFTs look a lot like investment contracts.)  Read More: ENS and the Limitations of DAO Governance  What this means in practice is that the value of CryptoPunks will likely be closely tied to the value of Yuga Labs. Larva Labs isn’t exactly a mom-and-pop business, but its stubborn refusal to pump the value of its tokens in this specific way put it somewhat at odds with the “number go up” ethos of the broader crypto community. (This isn’t to say its intentions were always totally pure – a controversy around a CryptoPunks subcollection known as “V1 Punks” suggests the Larva Labs team hasn’t always handled community outreach in the best way.)  Where Bored Apes go, the rest of the NFT market goes. Now, whether they like it or not, CryptoPunk holders are joined at the hip with their Bored Ape counterparts.  Such is the Matroyshka doll-like structure of the NFT market. Andreessen Horowitz has a stake in many of the valuable companies in crypto; OpenSea, an Andreessen Horowitz investment, controls most of the volume in the NFT market; and Yuga Labs, also reportedly an Andreessen Horowitz investment, now controls some of the market’s most valuable intellectual property.

The central bank is using donations to support “humanitarian aid programs” as well as Ukraine's armed forces, according to the website. “The people will continue their fight for freedom, but they need more ammunition and necessities,” the website read.  “Crypto assets proved extremely helpful in facilitation of funding flows to Ukrainian citizens and soldiers, as well as in raising awareness and engaging people worldwide,” Oleksandr Bornyakov, an official at the digital ministry, said in a statement.

42421191,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXgIZR,1647277577,Ukrainian Crypto Entrepreneur: Bitcoin Is a Lifeline,"The media presents a macro geopolitical view of how the Russian-Ukrainian War is developing, so it is important to consider the human element of this conflict and how everyday citizens’ lives are being impacted.  Imagine waking up one day to the news that a major neighboring global power has invaded your homeland and you might be called to action, even though you have never held a weapon in your life. This has been the experience of millions of Ukrainian citizens in response to the invasion after President Zelensky ordered a mobilization that banned all men aged 18 to 60 from leaving the country.  I recently had the opportunity to connect with a young crypto entrepreneur, Alex Obchakevich, who lives in the Ukrainian city of Vinnytsia and lent his perspective on the conflict. Obchakevich’s home city is located in west-central Ukraine approximately 145 miles from Kiev. It is one of the cities that has been shelled by Russian forces. The war has significantly slowed Obchakevich’s internet connection, and our interview was conducted asynchronously through text over a period of several days.  “The war has completely changed my life,” Obchakevich said. “In addition to the terrible news, sadness, and air-raid alarms, there is also a slow internet connection that prevents me from working and conducting my business. And probably the saddest part is the uncertainty. Sometimes I sit on my bed at home, the siren sounds outside the window, and I don't feel like doing anything, not running for shelter, not trying to hide somehow. I just sit there and look out the window.”  Obchakevich is 24 and has run online businesses since the age of 17, coming from an impoverished family and needing to drop out of university to earn a living. Recently, he has turned to non-fungible tokens (NFT) and crypto, co-founding the Misfits DAO, which is a collective of artists, collectors, and investors in the NFT space. The decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) provides tools to help artists improve their organic outreach on multiple platforms, including metaverse galleries, Twitter Spaces and Discord channels. The unique art style from the community of artists ranges from fractal and generative art to photography.  This is the fight of free people against the propaganda of the Russian state.  Lamenting about the psychological impact of the war, Obchakevich said, “The constant stress is a big drain on normal life. At any moment an air-raid alarm can go off, and everyone needs to pack up quickly and run to a bomb shelter. Although over the last few days, I have not complied, I understand that I am taking a big risk.”  Individuals on both sides are turning to bitcoin (BTC) as a means of storing and transporting their wealth, especially in times of extreme distress. “The perception of cryptocurrencies is positively entrenched in the minds of Ukrainians,” said Obchakevich. “In countries with unstable economies, bitcoin will always attract attention because it allows people to feel financial freedom.” According to a report by Chainalysis, Ukraine is ranked fourth in crypto adoption globally on a per capita basis.  More than 1.7 million Ukrainians have fled the country’s borders since the conflict began, the United Nations says, the “fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II,” in the words of UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi. Although some refugees are transferring their funds into crypto as a method of safely storing and transferring their wealth across borders, “this is a small fraction, among only those that have prior experience with crypto,” said Obchakevich. “For the average citizen in a panic, it is easiest to cash in a dollar or euro. However, the frenzy near ATMs has only grown and it is very difficult to withdraw cash now.”  On the Russian side, the ruble has experienced a precipitous crash of approximately 43% since the conflict began. The ruble to bitcoin exchange rate reached a new all-time high of just above 5 million rubles over the same time period, a 40% premium above other bitcoin currency pairs. Although it is unknown whether the price movement is driven by everyday citizens, Russian oligarchs, or fund managers and institutions, there appears to be real demand for bitcoin during this extreme period of geopolitical distress.  Crypto is a neutral technology that can be leveraged by opposing forces. Regardless of the user’s nationality, political affiliation or intentions, she can engage with open source protocols to permissionlessly transmit value around the world. Although Russia is rumored to be investigating the use of crypto rails to circumvent economic sanctions, an act viewed as unpalatable by NATO and other western nations, crypto is also being used to fund efforts supporting the Ukrainian defense. Since the start of Russia’s invasion, almost $100 million worth of crypto has been donated to Ukraine’s government and non-governmental organizations to support Ukraine’s defense.  Beyond the physical barrage of artillery shells and mobilization of troops, the conflict has entered cyberspace. Ukraine Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov called for the formation of an “IT Army” to target online Russian interests, resulting in cyberattacks shutting down dozens of Russian websites. These targets included banks, corporations and government websites.  “Mass [distributed denial-of-service] attacks on Russian servers have become an integral part of life for Ukrainian IT workers,” said Obchakevich. “This is the fight of free people against the propaganda of the Russian state. On one side are Ukrainian marketers, hackers and programmers. On the other side are paid Russian hackers who do it for money.  “The difference is that the Ukrainians spend their personal money on advertising and resources to get the truth out, while the Russians spend government money to kill Ukrainian government websites, sow panic among the people and hide the real truth.”  “The funny thing is that the DDoS attacks on Russian servers involve ordinary schoolchildren and students,” Obchakevich continued. “There are thousands of them. These are young people with burning eyes, sitting at their computers around the clock to save their state.”  Obchakevich has not joined the front lines of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, but he is doing his part to contribute to the war effort. He and his business partners donated over $65,000 in crypto to the Ukrainian army, and locally they financially supported refugees from Kiev and eastern Ukraine.  As the Russian-Ukrainian War rages on, the value proposition for bitcoin and crypto in general will only continue to become clearer. For everyday citizens like Obchakevich, bitcoin provides an alternative to the current financial system and serves as an escape valve from oppressive regimes and the ensuing crippling economic conditions brought on by military conflict.  Reflecting on the future, Obchakevich said, “Ukraine is a very large country, and it is unrealistic for Russia to occupy the territory. Russia will not be able to wage a prolonged guerrilla war against Ukraine. I am not a military man, but if I have to take up arms I will take them and defend my homeland and my family.  “I think that cryptocurrencies will play a very important role in the formation of the ‘New Ukraine’ after the war. This will be a digital revolution, a big step on the axis of Web 3 and decentralization.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Leeor Shimron,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/03/14/ukrainian-crypto-entrepreneur-bitcoin-is-a-lifeline,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a8e8629e7edcc1701b8b9020b6d0e4c7a0fd5de0-1456x1454.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411492,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOS5o,1647276412,"Web 3’s Use of AI Will Present Challenges, but They Are Not Insurmountable","It is a logical evolution for Web 3 platforms to incorporate native artificial intelligence (AI).  AI is influencing every software category so Web 3 shouldn’t be an exception. But there are fundamental, technical roadblocks about Web 3 stacks for the adoption of AI technologies.  In previous articles in CoinDesk, I discussed the relevance of AI techniques for decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFT). Beyond understanding their clear value, it is important to see how AI can enter the Web 3 space in the near future, and what major roadblocks are currently preventing this to materialize.  Jesus Rodriguez is CTO and co-founder of blockchain data platform IntoTheBlock, as well as chief scientist of AI firm Invector Labs and an active investor, speaker and author in crypto and artificial intelligence.  “Software is eating the world” venture capital giant Marc Andreessen said in 2011, synthesizing the idea that companies operating in the physical world were transitioning to a digital one and that software would be their cornerstones.  Read More: What Is Web 3 and Why Is Everyone Talking About It?  Now, we can say that “machine learning (ML) is eating software” to pinpoint an oncoming trend in which most of the world’s software will be rewritten with AI/ML as its core building blocks. When you think about the omnipresent components of software applications, capabilities such as databases and identity come to mind. Intelligence, in the form of AI/ML models, is steadily becoming another foundational building block of modern software applications.  These days, software trends, including cloud computing, networking and cyber security are being reimagined with ML as a first-class citizen. Given that Web 3 is the next iteration of many of those software trends, ML will likely play a foundational role in the evolution of Web 3 technologies. Developing a thesis about the intersection of ML and Web 3 requires understanding both the trajectory of adoption of ML capabilities in Web 3 stacks as well as some of the fundamental challenges.  Layers of Web 3 intelligence  The addition of ML in Web 3 will not happen as an atomic trend; rather, it will be spread across different layers of the Web 3 stack. ML-driven intelligence can emerge in three key layers of Web 3.  Intelligent blockchains  The current generation of blockchain platforms has focused on building key distributed computing components that enable the decentralized processing of financial transactions. Consensus mechanisms, mempool structures and oracles are some of these key building blocks. Just as core components of traditional software infrastructures such as networking and storage are becoming intelligent, the next generation of layer 1 (base) and layer 2 (companion) blockchains will natively incorporate ML driven capabilities. For instance, we can think of blockchain runtime that uses an ML prediction for transactions to enable a massively scalable consensus protocol.  Intelligent protocols  Smart contracts and protocols are another component of the Web 3 stack that will start incorporating ML capabilities. DeFi seems to be the prototypical example for this trend. We are not far from seeing a generation of DeFi automated market makers (AMMs) or lending protocols that incorporate more intelligent logic based on ML models. For instance, we can imagine a lending protocol that uses an intelligent score to balance the types of loans from different types of wallets.  Intelligent dapps  Decentralized applications (dapps) are likely to become among the most likely Web 3 solutions to rapidly add ML-driven features. We are already seeing this trend in NFTs, but it’s going to become increasingly pervasive. The next-generation NFTs will transition from static images to artifacts that exhibit intelligent behavior. Some of these NFTs will be able to change their behavior based on the mood of their audience or the profile of new owners.  Top down, not bottom up  In considering layers of Web 3 intelligence, we might naively assume that a bottom-up adoption trend is most logical. Blockchain runtimes can become intelligent, and some of that intelligence can influence higher layers of the stack like DeFi protocols or NFTs. Yet, there are serious technological limitations that would force a top-down, instead of bottom- up, adoption of ML technologies in Web 3 stacks.  The root of these technological roadblocks trace to the architecture of the current generation of blockchain runtimes. In principle, blockchains are designed around a distributed computing paradigm that coordinates different nodes to perform computations that lead to a consensus about the processing of transactions.  Read More: Web 3 Is a Long Fight Worth Fighting  That approach contrasts to the state-of-the-art ML models that require complex, long-running computations for training and optimization which have been designed mostly for centralized architectures. This friction means that incorporating native ML capabilities in blockchain runtimes, although possible, is going to require some iterations.  DeFi protocols have fewer limitations from embracing ML features as they can rely on oracles and external intelligent agents that can fully benefit from existing ML platforms. And the limitation is almost non-existent for dapps and NFTs. From this perspective, we think the adoption of ML capabilities in Web 3 solutions is likely to follow a top-down trajectory going from dapps to protocols to blockchain runtimes instead of the opposite.  Intelligent Web3 is already here  The science fiction writer William Gibson wrote, “The future is already here – it's just not evenly distributed” to explain the trajectory of futuristic technology trends. The idea applies perfectly to the intersection of AI and Web 3.  The rapid evolution of ML research and technology in the last decade has translated into an overwhelming number of ML platforms, frameworks and APIs that can be used to add intelligent capabilities to Web 3 solutions. We are already seeing isolated examples of intelligence in Web 3 applications. so we can safely say that intelligent Web 3 is already here, just not evenly distributed.

Sim;paul is a traditional brokerage operator authorized by both the Central Bank of Brazil and the Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM). While Binance has done business in Brazil for some time, pending legislation in that country would require crypto exchanges to have proper licensing, making either opening of a local office or acquiring an existing operator a necessity.  Any deal would require the approval of regulatory authorities, Binance added in its announcement Monday.  In August , Binance suspended the trading of futures contracts on its Brazilian platform to comply with local regulations.  “In a fast-developing market like Brazil, crypto can transform and facilitate people's lives and as such we believe – in full collaboration with local authorities – that Binance has a lot to contribute in developing the community and ecosystem in Brazil,” said Binance founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao.  Sim;paul was founded by João Silveira in 2019, and in October 2020 received authorization from the Central Bank of Brazil to start operating, according to the company's website.  Brazil is a key strategic market, Binance told CoinDesk recently, noting that in 2021 active transacting users were up 125% versus the previous year.

42375114,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw5ijD,1647271119,Proposal Limiting Proof-of-Work Is Rejected in EU Parliament Committee Vote,"A proposed rule that could have, in effect, banned the popular cryptocurrency bitcoin across the European Union (EU) has been quashed.  The European Parliament’s economic and monetary affairs committee voted 30-23 on Monday to keep the provision out of a draft of the proposed Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) framework, the EU’s comprehensive regulatory package for governing digital assets. Six committee members abstained.  The provision, which was added to the draft last week, sought to limit the use of cryptocurrencies powered by an energy-intensive computing process known as proof-of-work across the EU’s 27 member states. The proposal met with a heavy backlash from crypto advocates worldwide.  Stefan Berger, a member of the EU Parliament and rapporteur of MiCA, tweeted the success: ""First stage win at #MiCA in committee! By accepting my proposal, members have paved the way for future-oriented crypto regulation. It is now a matter of accepting the report as a whole in the final vote & sending out a strong signal for innovation.""  CoinDesk reported yesterday that the vote on the provision in question was too close to call and a small majority might defeat it. The proposal required all cryptocurrencies to be subject to the EU’s “minimum environmental sustainability standards with respect to their consensus mechanism.”  For popular proof-of-work cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether, which are already traded in the EU, the rule proposed a phase-out plan to shift their consensus mechanism from proof-of-work to other methods that use less energy, like proof-of-stake.  Although there are plans to move ethereum to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism this year, it’s unclear whether the same can be done for bitcoin.  A slim majority of the monetary committee voted in favor of a compromise that calls on the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm responsible for proposing new legislation, to offer alternative regulation:  “5. By 1 January 2025, the Commission shall present to the European Parliament and to the Council, as appropriate, a legislative proposal to amend Regulation (EU) 2020/852, in accordance with Article 10 of that Regulation, with a view to including in the EU sustainable finance taxonomy any crypto asset mining activities that contribute substantially to climate change mitigation and adaptation.”  Proof-of-work has come under heavy criticism from some regulators and politicians around the world over energy concerns. Some EU leaders are concerned that renewable energy may be channeled into sustaining cryptocurrencies like bitcoin instead of national use.  After the parliament vote, the MiCA draft will move on to a ""trilogue,"" a formal round of negotiations between the European Commission, Council and Parliament.

Sign up here to get it in your inbox each weekday morning.  Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Bitcoin sees early bounce to $39,000. U.S. 10-year yield hits highest point since July 2019.  Featured stories: Bitcoin's put-call skews pull back from February highs. Ether awaits a triangle breakout.  And check out the CoinDesk TV show “First Mover,” hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern time. Today’s show will feature guests:  Kevin O'Leary, chairman of O'Shares ETFs, and ""Shark Tank"" Co-Host.  Jeff Mei, director of global strategy, Huobi Global.  Bradley Tusk, founder and CEO, Tusk Strategies.  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  Bitcoin's (BTC) bounce from key price support stalled near $39,000 ahead of American trading hours as the futures tied to the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index erased a 1% gain and dipped into the red. Meanwhile, the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.10%, the highest since July 2019, according to the chart platform TradingView.  The benchmark yield has risen by 40 basis points in seven days and nearly 60 basis points this year. The U.S. 10-year breakeven inflation rate reached a record high of 2.785% last week, per Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.  Historically, bitcoin has chalked up price rallies in an environment of rising inflation expectations and bond yields, according to Charlie Morris, chief investment officer at ByteTree Asset Management.  However, dollar strength has emerged as one of bitcoin's critical nemesis since the March 2020 crash and seems to be stopping the crypto from taking advantage of the ongoing rise in bond yields. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against majors, stood just under 99.0, having hit a 22-month high of 99.42 last week.  ""If the dollar starts to ease, higher [bitcoin] prices will follow,"" ByteTree's Morris tweeted. A big dollar sell-off looks unlikely during the next 48 hours, as the Federal Reserve is expected to hike rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday.  Aside from the macro stuff, traders will closely watch the European Union's (EU) vote on a draft of the proposed Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) framework, which could have widespread ramifications.  ""The bill as it is currently framed would require miners to submit environmental sustainability compliance plans. Failing to submit them would prevent their operation within the EU. The implications of this are huge – the EU is a major jurisdiction for crypto mining and crypto more generally, with over 10% of global bitcoin hash power emanating from the region,"" Simon Peters, market analyst at eToro, said in an email.  ""While not on the scale of the China bitcoin mining ban, the implication for the price of BTC and other crypto assets which follow on price, could be significant in the next few days. The crypto asset market has been buffeted by events, and this could lead to another tough trading period if the legislation passes,"" Peters added.  Bitcoin defended the weekly Ichimoku cloud support during the Asian trading hours even as a deteriorating coronavirus outbreak in mainland China pushed Hong Kong's stock index to a six-year low.  A tweet by Tesla's CEO Elon Musk that he won't sell bitcoin, ether (ETH) and dogecoin (DOGE) likely helped the top cryptocurrency remain resilient to sell-off in the Hong Kong stocks. The meme cryptocurrency dogecoin also witnessed a 10% spike, supposedly on Musk's tweet.

It shows that demand for puts, or options offering downside protection, is now relatively weaker than two weeks ago.  In other words, fears of an extended decline have subsided, with bitcoin consolidating below $40,000 amid a continued decline in U.S. stocks.  The six-month put-call skew saw a brief dip below zero over the weekend, implying a relatively higher demand for longer duration calls, or bullish bets.  According to the institution-focused over-the-counter tech platform Paradigm, calls dominated the volume last week, accounting for 67.7% of the options traded, with the majority activity concentrated at the March expiry $40,000 strike.  A call option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A put option purchaser gets the right to sell.  Put-call skews measure the implied volatility premium drawn by puts relative to calls.  Ether awaits range breakout  Ether has formed a contracting triangle identified by trend lines connecting Feb. 10 and March 2 highs and Jan. 24 and Feb. 24 lows.

42395804,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASzTqg,1647262809,Ethereum Staking Protocol Swell Raises $3.75M as Locked ETH Tops $26B,"Ethereum reached a major milestone last week in its highly anticipated transition to proof-of-stake, with 10 million ETH (about $26 billion) now locked in the Ethereum 2.0 staking contract.  Against that backdrop, a new staking protocol, Swell, has joined the ranks of projects helping investors get staking rewards for stashing their ether. The team announced Monday a $3.75 million seed round co-led by Framework, IOSG Ventures and Apollo Capital.  Ethereum, like most other blockchains, relies on a distributed network of volunteers to keep itself secure. While the network originally took after Bitcoin by employing a resource-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) model for validating transactions, it is in the midst of transitioning to a more efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) model, where one can stake 32 ether to become a network validator and deploy a node.  In exchange for lending compute power to help secure Ethereum, validators get a percentage of the fees generated as users transact on the network.  Read more: 10M Ether Now Locked on Eth 2.0 Staking Contract  ETH staking 101  Currently, it costs 32 ETH (about $82,000) to become a validator, though Swell and others are looking to lower that barrier to entry. Swell’s minimum commitment is 1 ETH. Significantly, the protocol will provide stakers with liquidity by granting them an interest-bearing token representing their stake.  Similar liquid staking solutions to Swell already exist – the most popular being Rocket Pool and Lido. Both products already make it easy for users to enter and exit their staking positions, and they allow minimum deposits much lower than Swell’s 1 ETH. Rocket Pool requires a minimum deposit of just .01 ETH, and Lido doesn’t have a minimum at all.  Read more: ETH Staking Startup ssv.network Raises $10M as Ethereum ‘Merge’ Inches Closer  Swell says its main advantage is in making it easier for users to earn additional interest through in-app “vaults.”  “We do everything for the user,” Swell co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Lecky Lao said of the project’s vaults feature. “After they stake, they get an NFT they can optionally put into a vault if they want to get some extra yield from DeFi farming. Basically, we reduce the entry barrier for the beginner.”  Swell plans to launch its beta on the Ethereum mainnnet in April.

Digital assets can also provide a significant revenue opportunity for sports organizations. Ticket sales, media rights and sponsorship are the three largest revenue streams for teams and leagues, PwC said.  All three streams could see notable growth with tokenized tickets, non-fungible-token (NFT) media rights and sponsorship of digital or metaverse events, the report added.  NFTs are digital asserts on a blockchain that represent ownership of virtual or physical items. Collectible NFTs and season ticket member tokens are evolutions and enhancements of traditional loyalty programs, but combining the metaverse with digital assets (both fungible tokens and NFTs) enables a whole new market for more fan segments, the report said.  Digital assets sales could become a major revenue stream for many teams and leagues in the next five years, the report noted.  The ability to build digital asset infrastructure will be the biggest challenge for the teams, and they will need sophisticated technology to connect the digital sales data with existing customer bases, it added.

An escalation between Russia and Ukraine and related economic sanctions have caused historical volatility and fear in financial markets. It arrives while the pandemic is still not entirely under control, and the lingering impact it had on supply chains and logistics is nowhere near subsiding. The situation has dealt a crippling blow to global stock markets as investors brace for the potential business impact war and related economic turmoil can have. At the same time, important geopolitical commodities like oil are skyrocketing in value. Gains in gold have also grown steady as investors move capital into known safe havens during such times of uncertainty or during periods of high inflation. Meanwhile, the highly volatile cryptocurrency market has recently decoupled from stocks and received newfound interest from oligarchs seeking to avoid economic sanctions and supporters of both sides looking to donate to the cause. However, their previous performance tied to stocks continues to make them a high-risk investment class.

42395810,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASzTuc,1647251284,"Inflation Worries Top Concerns Before Fed Meeting, Spur Musk Comment","Inflation appears to have become a top concern both on Wall Street and main street days before the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) decides its response to rising prices.  ""What are your thoughts about probable inflation rate over next few years,"" U.S.-based electric car maker Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk, tweeted late Sunday. Musk added that he would continue to hold bitcoin, ether and dogecoin, even though buying physical assets is often the best way to ride an inflationary wave.  Surging prices for food, energy and housing have sent inflation in the U.S. to a four-decade high and the Russia-Ukraine war is expected to worsen the situation.  ""We're likely to see another year in which 12-month inflation numbers remain very uncomfortably high,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said during a CNBC interview last week. The situation in Ukraine has exacerbated inflation and upcoming inflation reports will show ""further evidence of an impact on U.S. inflation of (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's war on Ukraine,"" Yellen added.  The general populace worldwide seems equally worried about a continued rise in costs. According to Google Trends, a widely used tool to gauge general or retail interest in trending topics, returned a value of 100 for the worldwide search query over the past 18 years.  A score of 100 represents peak popularity – the maximum number of searches observed for a term during a given time frame. In other words, more and more people are worried about rising prices and are scanning the web for information on how bad the situation could get and ways to hedge against the same.  Google Trends provides access to a mostly unfiltered sample of actual search requests made to the search engine and measures their searches on a range of 0 to 100, according to the company. The search value represents the search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the selected region and time.  The crypto community and the likes of Musk and MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor consider bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, a digital equivalent of gold.  ""USD consumer inflation will continue near all-time highs, and asset inflation will run at double the rate of consumer inflation. Weaker currencies will collapse, and the flight of capital from cash, debt, & value stocks to scarce property like bitcoin will intensify,"" Saylor tweeted in response to Musk's inflation query late Sunday. MicroStrategy, a software company, holds a sizable amount of bitcoin.  And though bitcoin has recently underperformed gold mostly on fears of faster monetary tightening by the Fed, observers remain confident of its long-term use case as a store of value.  ""Inflation is likely to be persistently high (but lower than now) for some years. This adds fuel to the bitcoin-as-a-hedge thesis and could encourage even more portfolio allocations to a liquid asset with an independent monetary policy and a hard cap on supply,"" Genesis Global Trading's daily newsletter dated Feb. 25 said.  Bitcoin was trading near $39,000 at press time, representing a 3% gain on the day. The cryptocurrency found buyers during early Asian hours after Musk tweeted his intention to hold the digital asset.  The Fed is likely to raise borrowing costs by 25 basis points later this week and signal a continued fight against inflation through the rest of the year. The expected first rate hike since 2018 seems to have been priced in by markets. Bitcoin has dropped nearly 40% in the past four months, predominantly on the Fed rate hike fears.

Source-Tradingview THETA Technical Analysis THETA coin price continues to trend lower as it approaches the $2.56 support level. Moreover, the rising selling pressure evident by the higher price rejection hints of a bearish fallout that could break $2 to reach the $1.75 mark. The constant rejection from the 50-day EMA after the death cross promotes the lower high formation with the increasing possibility of $2.56 fallout. However, on the opposite end, the breakout of 50-day EMA could initiate a price jump to the 200-day EMA accounting for a 40% jump.

DOGE exchanged hands at $0.111 on 4:10 UTC amid a largely flat crypto market. It surged following Musk’s tweet at 4:11 UTC, where he said he will continue to hold DOGE, ether, and bitcoin, and reached as high as $0.122 at 4:17 UTC.  The spike was likely driven by automated trading bots that track token mentions from popular accounts on social media sites like Twitter. Musk’s Twitter account, for instance, has a following of over 77.6 million.  Prices of DOGE slumped to $0.113 from the morning spike at the time of writing.  Musk has previously tweeted about DOGE on several occasions. In February 2021, he posted a picture of a rocket next to the moon and followed that tweet with a one-word tweet that stated “Doge” – a play on the saying of “going to the moon,” a term for an asset-price surge.  In May 2021, Musk stated he was working with dogecoin developers to improve system efficiency, which sent DOGE prices flying by 22%.

Proof of history uses time as a historical record of proof on top of the proof-of-stake method. Its adoption of the POH mechanism had ensured that it functions with high scalability and decreased the number of validators unlike the number required in the Ripple ledger. Transactions are completed faster and at a very low cost. This has made it attract a lot of decentralized finance (Defi) projects, institutional traders, and non-fungible tokens projects. What is Solana (SOL)? SOL is the token used to carry out transactions within the Solana open-source blockchain.
