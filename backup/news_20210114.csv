42385671,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2XhJ,1610666811,Lido Protocol Does Eth 2.0 Staking but With a DeFi Twist,"There's a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that lets ether holders back Ethereum 2.0 without losing liquidity, and it wants to give its participants a vote.      Until Feb. 12, ETH holders have a chance to earn some of the governance token for Lido, a new decentralized finance (DeFi) and staking protocol. There will be other opportunities in the future, but it's up to holders of the LDO token to decide when that will be.      Since Tuesday, the amount of ETH staked on Lido has more than doubled, breaking 60,000 ETH as of this writing.      Lido sits at Ethereum's sweet spot, putting the road to Eth 2.0 into DeFi. It gives people a fresh way to contribute ETH to staking on Ethereum's new beacon chain but still unlock the value of their ETH. It's one of those stories that somewhat strains credulity, very much an only-in-DeFi kind of scenario. So far it's working.      Kraken has already rolled out a similar product and Coinbase plans to, but those lack the element of distributed trust.      An early backer of Lido and a member of its DAO, Aave's Stani Kulechov, told CoinDesk over Telegram, ""Tokenized staking ETH is interesting, because you can use the tokenized staked ETH as collateral (for example in Aave) and get more liquidity in ETH so you can leverage quite a lot in Eth 2.0 staking, I'm curious to see how much leverage there will be in staking.""      Additionally, Lido has a governance token but it's taking a unique approach to distributing it. Unlike Compound's COMP, which announced a yield farming plan that ran forever, or Yearn, which unloaded it all super fast, Lido is parceling out its governance token as its stakeholders see fit.      Lido's governance token is called LDO. There are 1 billion of the tokens and 64% of them are dedicated to the founders and other early participants who got Lido off the ground, but that giant stash is locked for a year and then will be parceled out (vested) over the following year.      But, about 360 million tokens are in the DAO treasury, but only 4 million tokens have ever been made liquid, before the new distribution that started on Jan. 13.      These 4 million were distributed before LDO was announced, to ""early stakers and DAO treasury tokens.""    Read more: What is Yield Farming? The Rocket Fuel of DeFi Explained    The distribution that just began, to depositors in the stETH/ETH pool on Curve, will pass out another 5 million LDO until Feb. 12. To get access to the airdrop, users simply need to contribute to Curve's stETH/ETH pool, and then stake the liquidity provider (LP) tokens they receive into Curve's gauge. Step-by-step instructions are detailed on the Lido blog.      As an added benefit, holders who do so will also earn Curve's CRV token.      As of this writing, LDO is trading right around $1 each.    What is Lido?    Lido is a DAO that's meant to give users a way to their ETH behind the new iteration of Ethereum without really sacrificing its liquidity. The team spelled it out in a primer. The fact that this works is somewhat remarkable.      As we've previously reported, once users commit their crypto to Eth 2.0 staking, it very likely won't be available until 2022 at the earliest (though wonders may never cease). Regardless, once the ETH is in, there's no turning back.      Those who deposit ETH into Lido to stake for Eth 2.0 will receive stETH in return, which stands for staked-ETH.    Read more: Ethereum 2.0 Explained in 4 Easy Metrics    This is the part that will sound somewhat unbelievable to outsiders: This version of ETH is basically trading at parity with regular ETH.      On the downside, stETH is a token on Ethereum, which means it can't be used to pay gas fees. That would seem to suggest that it would have less value. On the other hand, stETH earns a return from staking and ETH does not. So maybe the two balance each other out.      Last month, CoinDesk estimated that each validator was earning about $6 per day in ETH, but the earnings are locked up, too.      But stETH gets those earnings in the form of fresh stETH. It's a cryptocurrency that rebases every day, like Ampleforth. Anywhere it resides, more stETH will appear. Users can trade it away and whomever receives it will begin earning the returns the former holder had.      Ethereum 2.0 distributes a fixed amount each day among stakers, so the more ETH goes in, the less each staked ETH earns, so users will earn the most ETH at the beginning of their stake.      ""Right now, based on the amount of people that are staking, the rate is around 11.1%,"" Lido's marketing lead, Kasper Rasmussen, told CoinDesk in a phone call.      Backers don't get 100% of the returns; 10% is set aside for the DAO, for now largely funding its insurance against slashing. Eventually it will likely designate some of the returns to pay validators.      As of this writing, just under 63,000 stETH have been minted, held in just under 1,500 addresses.    Who is doing the staking?    Staking service providers are chosen by the DAO. Users staking ETH don't get to choose which staker their ETH goes to when they put it into Lido.      ""To become an approved operator for LIDO it is discussed by the LIDO community and it is voted on by token holders,"" Rasmussen explained.      The stakers are currently well-known staking companies in the space. The current staking providers are all members of the DAO, Stakefish, Staking Facilities, P2P, Certus and Chorus One. Any company can propose joining via the Lido DAO governance portal on Aragon.    Who got it started?    The Lido DAO members are ""Semantic Ventures, ParaFi Capital, Terra, KR1, P2P Capital, Bitscale Capital, Stakefish, Staking Facilities and Chorus One, Rune Christensen of Maker, Stani Kulechov of Aave, Banteg of Yearn, Will Harborne of Deversifi, Julien Bouteloup of Stake Capital, Jordan Fish and Kain Warwick of Synthetix,"" Rasmussen wrote in an email.      They contributed $2 million collectively to get the project off the ground.    Why Curve?    Rasmussen said that the advantage of Curve is that it has accounted for the rebasing factor of stETH. Using a traditional automated market maker (AMM) that simply runs on the ratio of the two tokens in the pool, the daily change can throw the balances out of kilter.      ""The risk is here if you're providing liquidity, instead of getting your daily staking rewards there's a risk that it's arbitraged away by other traders,"" Rasmussen said.      The creator of Curve, Michael Egorov, said it was a relatively simple fix, one already dealt with via Aave tokens. ""We do support the way stETH works (e.g. growing in quantity like Aave aTokens rather than increasing every token's value as staking is going),"" he told CoinDesk in an email.",POSITIVE,ETH | LDO,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | REGULATION | TRADING | LDO,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/01/14/lido-protocol-does-eth-20-staking-but-with-a-defi-twist,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bbf91886b73114d02c1253d75eae4109009ec7ab-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385629,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2XQx,1610664672,Tether's Bank Says It Invests Some Customer Funds in Bitcoin,"Deltec, Tether's Bahamas-based bank, announced Thursday it was investing some customer funds in bitcoin. A lawyer for Tether denied that any of those funds were Tether's.      Still, the announcement, made by Deltec Bank & Trust Chief Investment Officer Hugo Rogers during a year-in-review video, may raise new questions about whether the dollar-pegged USDT stablecoin, which is in theory backed by cash and ""cash equivalents,"" as well as ""other assets and receivables made by loans,"" is actually backed in any way by bitcoin.      ""We bought bitcoin for our clients at about $9,300 so that worked very well through 2020 and we expect it to continue working well in 2021 as the printing presses continue to run hot,"" Rogers said in the video.      Twitter user lenne0816 appears to have been the first to surface the video, which was posted online on Jan. 13.      Through a spokesperson, Tether General Counsel Stuart Hoegner confirmed that Deltec is still the stablecoin issuer's bank.      He later told CoinDesk, ""We are aware of recent statements by Deltec Bank & Trust Limited about the purchase of digital tokens for and on behalf of their customers. Tether does not outsource decisions about its reserves. Deltec does not purchase digital tokens for and on Tether's behalf.""      Following the publication of this article, an attorney for Deltec, Elisa D'Amico, a partner at K&L Gates LLP, said, ""While some of the bank’s customer investment portfolios hold positions in bitcoin products, this is limited mostly to high-net-worth individuals and External Asset Management. In addition, Mr. Hugo Rogers’s statement in the video regarding the investment strategies for some clients had no relation whatsoever to Tether’s depositary assets with Deltec and, in fact, made no reference to Tether at all.""      Deltec made headlines in 2018 after Tether published a letter from the bank announcing it had $1.8 billion in cash and other assets, roughly matching the amount of USDT in circulation at the time.      A Deltec executive later confirmed that the letter, which was unsigned, was authentic.    Read more: Tether Produces Letter Vouching for Dollar Deposits, but Bank Hedges    The next year, the New York Attorney General's office revealed that Bitfinex, Tether's sister company through shared ownership and executives, had lost close to $1 billion after its payment processors' bank accounts were frozen and funds seized. Bitfinex had been covering up the losses by borrowing from Tether's reserves, which are meant to back the stablecoins it has in circulation.      The companies are currently under an injunction to cease any further loan activities between themselves, though this injunction is set to expire on Jan. 15.      Tether issuance has been on a tear since the injunction was first handed down, and some $25 billion in USDT are currently in circulation. Bitcoin's price, which some academics and investors allege is buoyed by USDT issuance, has broken new highs, rising past $40,000 per coin as well in recent months.

42385640,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2Xen,1610663827,What Crypto Can Expect From Gary Gensler at the SEC,"This week, reports emerged that Gary Gensler, the former chairman of the Commodity Future Trading Commission (CFTC) is set to be President-elect Joe Biden’s choice to take over the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This is good news for the digital assets industry. From my experience with Gensler, whether the subject is digital assets, swaps or market structure, I can attest that he is thoughtful and broad-minded about the future of crypto-assets and that he understands the role enlightened regulators can play in boosting innovation. I can also promise he will not simply be a cheerleader.    Jeff Bandman is Founder and Principal of Bandman Advisors and a former senior CFTC official.  Comprehension    First of all, he gets it. He has clearly devoted himself immersively to understanding the space on many levels – technology, policy, economics and otherwise. He has testified on digital currencies policy and regulation before Congress, taught blockchain and digital currencies at MIT Sloan School of Management, and participated in numerous public and private discussions in the U.S. and internationally (some of which I’ve participated in and had exchange of views). He will step into the job shovel-ready, as well-informed and engaged with digital assets as one could possibly hope for the chair of a U.S. financial regulator to be.    Market structure    I think it is highly likely that he will make market structure a high priority. Unlike previous SEC chairs, who had enforcement or M&A backgrounds, Gensler’s background is in markets and financial technology as well as policy.      Arriving at the CFTC in 2009 following the financial crisis, he led major reform of the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market under the 2009 G20 Pittsburgh accord, and he helped draft the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which reorganized the financial system. The CFTC passed over 65 rules in response to its Dodd-Frank mandate.      The industry was not always happy with the outcomes, to put it mildly. There were plenty of complaints that the CFTC’s reforms would irreparably harm the swaps market.      However, the U.S. swaps market remains broadly speaking vibrant, liquid and trusted, and performed with efficiency and resilience even in March 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. This will reinforce his conviction that investors and other stakeholders trust well-regulated markets.      See also: Gary Gensler - Even if a Thousand Projects Don’t Make It, Blockchain Is Still a Change Catalyst (2019)      Gensler was mindful of the hold enjoyed by swaps market incumbents, and sought to enable challengers and insurgents (within a strong regulatory framework). In crypto, the “incumbents” are a largely different population, but these dynamics could be repeated.      Gensler will have strong mandates and expectations from the progressive side of the aisle . Accordingly, we can expect strong focus on investor protection to balance out promotion of capital formation using crypto-assets, and a need to ensure crypto does not become a side-door or back-door to circumvent regulatory frameworks.      I expect we will see much greater clarity on market structure and infrastructure for crypto assets – the regulatory clarity that will promote adoption and investor confidence – and I would be shocked if there are not things that make the industry howl.    ETFs    Under Gensler, I think we will see the SEC green-light retail bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) finally. I anticipate he will review closely, and be persuaded by, data regarding the underlying liquidity of the spot market and the integrity of selected source marketplaces where price discovery and formation are occurring.      The outlook could evolve from “I don’t want anything bad to happen on my watch” to “how can these be offered safely to American investors”? Oversight of the underlying spot market could involve a greater role for the SEC as well .      The role of the Strategic Hub for Innovation and Financial Technology (or FinHub) could also be enhanced. This office, overseen by Valerie A. Szczepanik, was recently elevated to report directly to the SEC Chair (thus aligning it with LabCFTC’s 2019 elevation). Chair Gensler may use FinHub not just for engagement but to drive stronger convergence of development and execution of policy across internal silos.    International cooperation    How will things play out internationally?      During Chair Gensler’s CFTC tenure (ending in 2014), relationships with other national regulators were strained, to put it mildly. International regulators with long memories have already asked me about this, worried that Gensler tried to impose the U.S. approach to swaps on other jurisdictions, and that we might expect more of the same.      I don’t think international conflict will be a hallmark of his approach to crypto regulation. I believe we can expect strong international collaboration and cooperation. Crypto-assets regulation is very different than the international swaps market.      First of all, the Biden Administration is widely expected to embrace multilateralism with regard to international policy and engagement. For the SEC Chair to take a different approach would strike a markedly different tone.      Second, the CFTC under Chair Gensler’s leadership was either the first jurisdiction, or among the first jurisdictions, to adopt OTC reforms after the financial crisis. Much of the international friction arose because the U.S. went first, and CFTC rules, guidance and interpretations were given extraterritorial effect to fill a vacuum and deter regulatory arbitrage. Recent CFTC rule-makings on cross-border issues have referred to changed circumstances now that other G20 and non-G20 jurisdictions have largely (though not completely) implemented the 2009 Pittsburgh reforms (the SEC being among the last to do so, having completed its framework for security-based swaps trading just last month).      The global landscape of crypto-assets regulation in 2021 is far different from OTC swaps circa 2011. Although there is not a one-size-fits-all approach by any means, many jurisdictions have implemented rigorous and innovative crypto-assets regulatory frameworks already. Others, such as the EU, have comprehensive proposals under consideration.    I expect we will see much greater clarity on market structure and infrastructure for crypto assets.    Moreover, there are numerous international workstreams under the aegis of the FSB, BIS, FATF, G7, G20, OECD, IMF, CPMI, IOSCO and others. Although gaps and differences remain, as does potential for regulatory arbitrage in the global digital finance landscape, Chair Gensler will not encounter the regulatory vacuum he found in swaps. That said, we should not expect the SEC to be reticent to promote its perspective on international regulatory framework, or to be reluctant to advocate greater harmonization.      Nor does he have a clear statutory mandate for action with regard to crypto-assets from Congress that he did under Dodd-Frank because Congress has not adopted any crypto-assets legislation. In the absence of legislation or other oversight, he may well have considerable latitude.    Spot markets    Here’s a major unanswered question. Will Gensler seek, and obtain, a mandate from Congress for the SEC to regulate and supervise the spot (or cash) market for crypto-assets that are not securities, and to oversee the markets that offer trading?      Currently there is no U.S. federal regulator that supervises trading of crypto-assets like bitcoin and Ethereum that have been deemed not to be securities. The CFTC has enforcement authority. For example, if there is fraud or manipulation in the spot market that causes distortions (or worse) in the derivatives markets that it does directly regulate. But that is not the same as regulatory or supervisory authority.      See also: Gensler Said to Be Named SEC Chairman: Reuters      FinCEN, at the Treasury Department, has authority from an AML/BSA perspective, but again these do not equate to supervision for market integrity, business conduct and safety and soundness. The SEC and CFTC do that for their respective regulated exchanges and other markets. This leaves a major regulatory gap in the US federal framework.      Will Gensler seek this type of authority from Congress? Will Congress grant it and provide the necessary resources? Will that be the “price of admission” for retail bitcoin ETFs? If this happens, it won’t be overnight.    Outlook    Having shaped the structure of the global swaps market, Gensler will likely embrace the opportunity to drive the regulatory structure of the crypto-assets market.      Of course, an SEC Chair cannot act unilaterally. He will need votes from his fellow Commissioners and support from other stakeholders to execute his vision or agenda. Non-crypto priorities may take precedence, starting with the pandemic as well as other policy initiatives of the new administration that will demand resources and attention. That said, Gensler has demonstrated his ability to drive an independent agency to execute on multiple fronts simultaneously.      Like everything else in crypto, this should be interesting, unpredictable and full of twists and turns. The regulatory certainty the industry gets may not be the exact flavor it seeks.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Jeff Bandman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/01/14/what-crypto-can-expect-from-gary-gensler-at-the-sec,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9c5affe912aba30bdfb8edeca466c5b7df0ec73b-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385644,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2Xl5,1610663096,"Bitcoin Miners Aren’t Responsible for Recent Price Dips, Data Shows","“Miners are selling” is a popular trope used to explain bitcoin’s occasional downward price action. But on-chain data doesn’t support this narrative, according to analysts and mining pools themselves.      After bitcoin’s correction earlier this week to the tune of nearly 30%, miners were a popular scapegoat. But miners have been extremely consistent in their selling habits for months, according to network data collected by Glassnode and analyzed by CoinDesk.      For the past six months, weekly bitcoin flows from mining wallets to exchanges have been steady despite the cryptocurrency’s more than 330% gains over the same period. The only anomalous activity seen among mining wallets happened well before bitcoin’s correction.      Since July 2020, miners have sent an average of 2,100 coins per week to exchanges, per CoinDesk Research. Miners are currently on track to finish another extremely average week with only 1,200 coins transferred so far from their wallets for cryptocurrency exchanges.      Confirming this observation, Coin Metrics senior analyst Karim Helmy told CoinDesk there isn’t any on-chain data supporting increased miner selling.      “BTC-denominated gross inflows and outflows out of mining wallets have both remained stable, as have net flows,” Helmy said in a direct message.    The timing is off    An unusually large reduction in mining wallet supply, however, did occur over a recent four-day period from Dec. 26 to 30. During this period, the aggregate balance of mining wallets dropped by 21,000 BTC, a 1% decrease.      But instead of possibly causing a correction, these transfers happened while bitcoin was climbing from $26,000 to $29,000. Over the next nine days, moreover, bitcoin's price gained another 43% before temporarily topping out just below $42,000 and falling nearly 30% into Monday morning.      These coins don’t appear to have ever been sent to exchanges, per Glassnode data. Over the four-day period, exchange addresses received a total of less than 2,400 coins from mining wallets, an amount far less than the 21,000 withdrawn from mining wallets.      Even if every coin sent by miners exchanges were instantly sold at market, however, their order would represent a tiny percentage of daily trading volume.      Miners sent 1,890 BTC to exchanges on Dec. 26, 2020, worth roughly $48 million at the time and the largest single-day transfer in the past year. That same day, Binance – currently the largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume – reported over 148,000 BTC in volume on its BTC/USDT pair, the exchange's largest bitcoin market.      Assuming miners sold all their coins on one market at one exchange, they would represent 1.3% of its daily volume.    Pools are stacking, not selling.    Leading mining pools are in fact increasing their bitcoin holdings, not liquidating them, with the balances belonging to miners at F2Pool and Lubian – the two largest mining pools by their individual holdings – steadily increasing for the past eight months, per Glassnode.      “I’m not sure what addresses they’re watching,” said Poolin CEO Kevin Pan, calling anything showing a significant increase in miner selling “maybe fake data.”      Read more: Bitcoin Plummets as Miners Sell Inventory, Spot Markets Panic      Even though Slush Pool doesn’t closely track what their miners do with their bitcoin payouts, engineer and technical writer Daniel Frumkin told CoinDesk, “We know that many of our miners are long BTC and only sell the portion of their revenue that’s needed to cover costs and manage risk.”      Thus, when the price drastically increases, Frumkin explains, miners are able to and in fact do sell fewer bitcoins, not more since the price appreciation boosts their profit margins per coin mined.    So, who is selling?    More than likely, recent price dips are primarily caused by U.S. investors realizing some profits.

42385633,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2XVz,1610661477,Bitcoin Core’s Latest Release Is Out: Here’s What’s in It,"Originally slated for Dec. 1, 2020, Bitcoin Core version 0.21.0 is now available for download, and includes a handful of notable changes to Bitcoin’s primary software implementation. Most notably, Bitcoin now supports Tor’s latest address format, Taproot’s code is now live for testing and Bitcoin Core finally gets manual fee setting.      With bitcoin’s price pumping, these new features don’t grab headlines every day, but the improvements they make to the Bitcoin network’s privacy, tooling and complex transaction logic are building a stronger foundation as the cryptocurrency sees a new wave of investor interest.    Taproot is one step closer    The consensus rules for the highly anticipated Taproot upgrade, which will allow for more complex smart contracts using Schnorr signatures, have been slightly tweaked since they were merged into Bitcoin Core in October. Taproot is also now fully live on Bitcoin’s signet, a sandbox network for developers to test new software and upgrades before pushing them to Bitcoin’s mainnet.      With the code now ready for testing, developers can now test the feature before activation begins later this year.    Read more: Bitcoin’s Future: Exactly How a Coming Upgrade Could Improve Privacy and Scaling  Fees get a makeover    Another change some 3.5 years in the making, Bitcoin Core now allows its users to set manual fees which are denominated in satoshis (Bitcoin’s smallest unit) instead of in bitcoin. Before, Bitcoin Core relied on a fee estimator for transactions, and these fees were set by specifying a bitcoin amount (say, 0.00001 BTC) instead of satoshis (1000 sats).    Privacy    Additionally, the new version supports privacy browser Tor’s V3 address. Before this update, Tor V3 addresses could not fit into the message data that Bitcoin nodes share to connect with each other. Core now has a new method to transport these addresses so that nodes can establish peer-to-peer connections through them, a necessary addition as Tor V2 address will no longer be functional by next year.      The release also introduces a new block-filtering system for “light clients” (wallets that do not keep a full history of Bitcoin’s transaction ledger but queries data as needed from a full node). Instead of using so-called “bloom filters” to query whatever blocks these wallets need to make transactions, now, a process called “compact client-side block filtering” makes this possible.      This new method is more privacy-preserving for light clients, because the nodes create the block filters ahead of time for the wallets, and the wallet will request block data on a case-by-case basis to retrieve the specific transaction data they need. The old process had wallets requesting specific block data from their peer nodes.    Bitcoin gets a new sandbox    Bitcoin is also getting a new testing network. Signet, as it’s called, is now operational and takes its place beside Bitcoin’s other test-only blockchains, regtest and testnet.    Read more: Coder Proposes Alternative to Bitcoin’s ‘Notoriously Unreliable’ Testnet    The new signet is centrally controlled and so is more reliable than Bitcoin’s other testing grounds; there is currently one public signet available, though developers can spin up their own, as well.    Other notable changes to Bitcoin Core    Bitcoin Core now supports descriptor wallets, as well. These wallets use scripts instead of keys to execute functions, so this – among other things – will make it easier for Bitcoin Core wallets to partake in things like multi-signature transactions; it will also pave the way for hardware wallet integration.      In addition to many other minor tweaks, Bitcoin Core now supports the SQLite database, as well as a feature that reduces the amount of rebroadcasting attempts a node makes when it fails to broadcast a transaction to its peers. It also comes with a new dashboard for easily viewing network information and peer node data.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | WALLET,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/01/14/bitcoin-cores-latest-release-is-out-heres-whats-in-it,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fb928d912130890b44d072be9bbbc3a6edfe2211-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385645,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2XmL,1610659805,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Hits $40K Again While Ether Volume Is Erupting This Year,"After closing out last week at over $40,000 on Sunday, bitcoin hit that price again Thursday while traders are pushing ether volumes to new liquidity levels.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $39,318 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 8.5% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $36,125-$40,066 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC above the 10-hour and 50-hour moving averages on the hourly chart, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price was back to bull mode Thursday, steadily climbing to as high as $40,066, according to CoinDesk 20 data. It’s a reversal from this week’s bearish-to-sideways action, with the world’s oldest cryptocurrency at $39,318 as of press time.      Read More: Bitcoin Bounces, Options Market Sees 20% Chance of $50K at Month’s End      “Bitcoin passing $40,000 was seen by many as inevitable, and reaching this level is just the continuation of a trend of smart money continuing to buy even as traders with less conviction shake out during sell-offs,” Guy Hirsch, managing director for U.S. at multi-asset brokerage eToro, told CoinDesk. The last time bitcoin was over $40,000 in the spot markets was Sunday, Jan. 10, prior to a precipitous fall opening the week.      “Institutions are still buying up BTC in huge quantities,” said cryptocurrency over-the-counter trader Alessandro Andreotti. “I think this rally can continue as before, but it’s too early to call.”      In the derivatives market, funding rates are still in positive territory, signalling that leveraged traders are more than willing to pay up to pile more margin on long plays, according to data aggregator Skew.      “High volatility is having little impact on risk appetite,” noted Denis Vinokourov, head of research at crypto brokerage Bequant. “Recent success in these opportunistic and somewhat ambitious market bets is also likely driving herd-like behavior.”      Indeed, volatility is high in the bitcoin market: The cryptocurrency’s 30-day realized volatility was at over 89% Wednesday, the highest it has been since April 17, 2020, when that metric was at 92% in the early days of coronavirus-induced turmoil across all markets.      Analysts don’t expect volatility in the cryptocurrency market to abate, which can actually be good for traders but can be horrendous for long-term investor balance sheets, particularly institutional funds with limited partners to whom they must answer.      “People need to understand that bitcoin is a hyper-asset with a built-in steam engine that is explosive up and down,” noted over-the-counter crypto trader Henrik Kugelberg. “With all the money printing and the sad developing spread of COVID-19 throughout the world, widespread agonizing economic hardship and a few more factors spell advantage to bitcoin.”      Chad Steinglass, head of trading for digital assets capital markets firm CrossTower, agrees gyrations in crypto will continue. “I believe that the trend of bull runs briefly interrupted by short duration profit taking dips will continue for the foreseeable future.”    Ether volume bonanza so far in 2021    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Thursday, trading around $1,210 and climbing 8.5% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      In 2020, ether volumes on the eight major CoinDesk 20 spot exchanges averaged $231 million per day. In 2021 so far, those volumes are up almost twelvefold, averaging $2.7 billion per day.      Brian Mosoff, chief executive officer of investment firm Ether Capital, noted decentralized finance, or DeFi, as a spark leading to volumes beginning to rise in 2020. For 2021, Mosoff cites the ongoing bull run and new derivatives tools coming online for traders.      Read More: Paxos Makes Fresh Push for DeFi Market With New Oracle Integration      “Although 2020 ended in a bull market, the first half of the year saw the ETH prices average just a couple hundred dollars and a lack of positive sentiment due to the prolonged bear market and then COVID-19,” Mosoff said. ”Adding fuel to the fire, 2021 has kicked off with the continuation of the crypto bull and the pending launch of the CME futures and institutions waking up to the narrative around Ethereum's value proposition.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mixed Thursday, mostly in the green.

Nick Fuentes, the far-right internet personality whose livestream from the Capitol takeover resulted in his banning from the streaming site DLive, received the single-largest donation: about $250,000, or 13.5 BTC.      There is no evidence that Fuentes entered the Capitol during the events of Jan. 6. However, he was present at the initial rally, was spotted on the Capitol grounds and promoted President Trump's ""Stop the Steal"" event for weeks, Chainalysis said.      The rest of the funds appear to have been split among a smattering of other accounts with ties to far-right ideologies, Chainalysis said. Neo-Nazi blog Daily Stormer received 3% of the total, anti-immigration group VDARE 3.3% and white nationalist leader Patrick Casey 5%, among others. Yahoo News first reported the story.      In all, the transactions represent an unprecedented crypto windfall for the domestic extremists groups that Chainalysis said it tracks.      See also: Tron-Owned Video Platform Criticized for Hosting Extremists, US Capitol Rioters      Chainalysis declined to identify the alleged donator by name due to privacy concerns and ongoing legal proceedings. However, it described the individual as a French blogger who may now be deceased. Chainalysis pointed to a seeming suicide note posted online one day after the donations initiated.      The individual laments what he claimed to be the ""decline"" of Western civilization and the ""rejection of our ancestors and our heritage."" That language tracks with rhetoric common in white nationalist circles. He pledged to ""leave my modest wealth to certain causes and people"" upon his death.      Investigators are still working to determine how much planning went into the Jan. 6 Capitol storming.      For its part, Chainalysis declined to directly link the donation to the political violence in Washington, D.C., but the ""timing warrants suspicion,"" Chainalysis wrote.

Speaking at an online event hosted by Princeton University in New Jersey, Jerome Powell said, “We don’t feel an urge or need to be first"" on CDBCs. “Effectively,” Powell continued, “we already have a first-mover advantage because [the U.S. dollar is] the reserve currency.”      Powell estimated it will take “years rather than months” before the Fed releases a CBDC, despite early studies of digital dollar–friendly blockchains at the central bank’s Boston outpost.      He added the Fed is “investing heavily” in understanding the technology and looking at the policy questions CBDCs pose.    Read more: Boston Fed Is Looking at ’30 to 40′ Blockchain Networks for Digital Dollar Experiments    Powell also admitted it was the private sector’s ability to create private money (in other words, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies) that caused the Fed to look into CBDCs.      “We know that in the past when private-sector money [is created], the public sometimes just thinks of it as money,” Powell said. “At some point, they find out that it’s not money and that’s a really bad thing we need to avoid.”      There's also a need for the Fed to be focused on ""better regulatory answers"" for global stablecoins, Powell said. At the end of last year, U.S. President Trump's Working Group on Financial Markets released a report that said stablecoins should meet the same regulatory standards as other aspects of the financial system.      ""They could become systemically important overnight,"" Powell said. ""We don't begin to have our arms around the potential risks and how to manage those risks. The public will expect that we do and has every right to expect that.

42385643,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2Xjp,1610648475,"Blockchain Bites: OCC's Head Stepping Down, Anchorage to Become First National 'Digital Asset Bank'","Bitcoin is booming again as crypto-bull Brian Brooks pushes through his ""open access"" banking rules before stepping down as the top U.S. banking regulator.    Top shelf    Going public? The Winklevoss twins are considering taking Gemini Trust, the cryptocurrency exchange and custodian founded in 2014, public, according to a Bloomberg interview. “We are definitely considering it and making sure that we have that option. We are watching the market and we are also having internal discussions on whether it makes sense,” Cameron Winklevoss said. The firm released the Gemini Credit Card offering cryptocurrency rewards today.      Race for adoption Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are lagging behind in crypto adoption, according to a new research note from the Australian investment bank Macquarie. “It is still unclear how entrenched private cryptos will become before CBDCs become a viable alternative for more efficient transactions,” with central banks at risk of losing control over the monetary system if so. While crypto is growing more popular, there are serious roadblocks to hyperbitcoinization – like brokerages running out of BTC and ex-Ripple CTOs losing their keys.      Security measures Grayscale Investments, the world’s largest digital currency asset manager, announced it has begun dissolution of its $19.2 million Grayscale XRP Trust, the latest step to minimize risk by distancing itself from XRP. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is suing Ripple Labs for unregistered sales of XRP. Grayscale, owned by CoinDesk parent Digital Currency Group, had already removed XRP from its large-cap crypto fund. Meanwhile, Japan’s top financial regulator has said XRP is a is a crypto asset, not necessarily a security, under state law.    Quick bites  10 ICOs: Where are they now?

The initial investment or total purchase cost was 48 BTC, or roughly $638,400 as per bitcoin’s price back then. Omkar Godbole tells the story of this legendary trade.    At stake    Finance, censorship and Brooks Acting Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks is set to step down today, ending a brief though impactful stint at the U.S.’ top banking regulator.      Brooks, who came to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency by way of Coinbase and Fannie Mae, has pushed for greater flexibility and amiability between the banking sector and crypto – including issuing several interpretative letters saying federally regulated banks can custody crypto, process stablecoin transactions and serve as nodes in a blockchain network.      As part of his mandate, Brooks also attempted to create a more “open” financial system by preventing banks from withholding services from “high-risk” businesses, like those in culturally sensitive industries such as tobacco, guns and fracking, as well as financially dubious firms like payday lenders.      Open for a 45-day comment period, Brooks finalized the rule today in what some are calling 11th-hour decision-making.      In November, Brooks and OCC Chief Economist Charles Calamoris proposed a rule that said banks should judge prospective clients based only on specific credit and operational criteria. This, the regulators wrote, would prevent “politically driven discrimination.”      Brooks hasn’t given up the theme. “We live in a world where not only information but also money might be controlled by a handful of elites who might not like the way that any one of us thinks [about an issue],” Brooks said yesterday at a livestreamed Elliptic event.      The outgoing OCC chief was speaking obliquely about financial firms like Shopify, Stripe and Deutsche Bank cutting ties with outgoing President Donald Trump in the wake of the Jan. 6 Capital riot that left five dead and interrupted the congressional certification of the presidential election results.      “Everything is at risk” if financial technology is politicized, Brooks said.      The trouble is, as J.P. Koning noted in a CoinDesk column in December, everything is already politicized. Responding to Brooks’ proposal to foster a politically neutral financial system, Koning wrote:      “In banking, loans are the fodder for creating safe deposits. So if a bank wants to attract modern consumers by setting up a clean supply chain (aka fair trade bank account) that means pruning source material for deposits, say coal miner loans.”      Banks are private institutions that have the right to make tough calls about who to serve and how to curate the types of products they have on offer, Koning argues. While some people see the rise of ""woke capitalism"" as a form of social coercion, it’s anything but.      No one compels the creation of cruelty-free T-shirts anymore than bonds definitely not backed by blood money. If there is a market for it, these non-neutral, inherently political products will arise, the argument goes. Further, attempts from regulators like Brooks to foist neutrality on the system – thereby preventing banks from cutting ties with dubious businesses for any number of reasons – is a bridge too far.      “The rule lacks both logic and legal basis, it ignores basic facts about how banking works and it will undermine the safety and soundness of the banks,” BPI President Greg Baer said in a Thursday statement responding to the formalized rule.      It’s for similar reasons that Twitter’s decision to banish Trump from its internet fiefdom is an act of free speech, rather than censorship.      Nic Carter, partner at Castle Island Ventures, CoinDesk columnist and public intellectual, calls this rhetorical technique the “private company fallacy.” While businesses are free to curate, this “implies a kind of anarcho-capitalist paradise, where firms are sovereign and the sole masters of their own destinies,” he wrote in a recent CoinDesk op-ed.      In reality, Carter argues, companies are enmeshed in a public-private network. Corporate executives filter in and out of public office (like Brooks!) and most industries are protected by regulations crafted with direct input from the private sector.      “Banks are demonstrably not private companies; they are better understood as public-private partnerships, being granted the ability to create money in exchange for heavy regulation,” Carter wrote.      Wherever you may draw the line, Brooks “open access” rule is reportedly likely to be overturned. Bloomberg reports banks are “fuming” at the last-minute act, and that several are already planning lawsuits.      In fact, much of Brooks’ legacy is in danger of being overturned. There’s nothing binding about interpretative letters – like the ones allowing banks to custody crypto or bank stablecoin clients. And even if it were, industry commenters have cast doubt that any banks would jump at the opportunities presented.      What this means for Anchorage’s conditional approval for a national trust charter – announced yesterday, setting it up as the first “digital asset bank” to be allowed to operate across the U.S. – is unknown.      To be sure, Brooks is thinking far ahead into the future, when banks will be self-driving bits of code.

42433496,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOS85h,1610646961,"Sci-Hub Leaves Handshake Blockchain After 2 Days, Citing Centralization Concerns","The recent alliance of pirate academic library Sci-Hub and a blockchain-based domain name system (DNS) was celebrated by the blockchain community. Now, it's already over.      Less than two days after registering its domain on Handshake, the distributed network for storing domain names, Sci-Hub founder Alexandra Elbakyan told CoinDesk she discontinued it because of the lack of decentralization.      Sci-Hub gets academic papers out from behind the paywalls of scientific magazines and provides them for free. The project has been exiled from various web domains, as well as the payment service PayPal.      The debacle is a fresh example of how decentralized web projects struggle to live up to the hype around them.      Namebase is the VC-funded company that is facilitating access to Handshake’s infrastructure. An initial tweet by Namebase about Sci-Hub's joining was met with much fanfare from crypto celebrities including Balaji Srinivasan and Dovey Wan, causing the price of the project’s native HNS token to surge. In contrast, the breakup has been largely unnoticed.      Elbakyan told CoinDesk that after talking to the team behind Namebase, she decided that it was impossible for her to control her domain.      Handshake was supported by some of crypto’s most prominent VCs and was part of a slew of projects aiming to decentralize the internet’s underlying infrastructure. Handshake’s predecessor Namecoin, the Ethereum Name Service, a platform for decentralized personal servers called Urbit and the network for distributed file storage Filecoin are other efforts to create what’s referred to as Web 3.0.    ‘Where is the decentralization?’    “I first just thought that another domain for Sci-Hub won’t hurt. But later I realized it’s them who really controls the domain, not me,” Elbakyan told CoinDesk via Telegram.      The Namebase team reached out to Elbakyan after Sci-Hub was banned by Twitter, reportedly due to a new copyright infringement case in India, she said.      “They wrote to me when I was having that stressful situation with Twitter,” Elbakyan said. “I just gave them an IP address and they connected it to the domain. That’s all I did. Now, where is the decentralization?”      This process looks a bit different from the original idea of Namebase, according to the project’s website. The concept is that people willing to register decentralized domains would buy the native NHS tokens, bid for available names and manage their domains using private keys.      According to Elbakyan’s exchange with Namebase founder Tieshun Roquerre and the project’s investor Eric Meltzer, one can own a top-level domain (TLD) on Handshake, like .hns, but not a particular subdomain registered there. (CoinDesk reviewed the messages provided by Elbakyan.)      Read more: Handshake Exchange Sees $10M in Token Trades as Race for Censorship-Resistant Websites Heats Up      The team offered to hand Elbakyan control over the entire .hns domain, along with some HNS tokens, so she could custody them and keep the records of all future subdomain registrations in .hns.      But Elbakyan wasn’t interested in managing records for the project, only in controlling her own subdomain. That, according to Meltzer, “will eventually be possible, but it requires a lot more engineering work.”      However, he told Elbakyan, the current owner of the .hns top-level domain “is completely anonymous,” so she shouldn’t be concerned it would be pressured to censor Sci-Hub, as multiple hosting services already did after Sci-Hub was sued by academic publishing houses for copyright infringement.      But relying on some centralized custodians to manage your domain feels like deja vu for Elbakyan.      “In fact, I’m not in control and they can throw me out at any moment, just like Twitter did. And yes, all domain services are like that, including .se and .do, but they aren’t promoting themselves as decentralized. Plus, those are reputable ones, and this is God knows who. They are just using Sci-Hub to promote this weird project,” Elbakyan said.    ‘Miscommunication’    Steven McKie, technical manager of Hanshake’s native HandyBrowser and CEO of Amentum, believes there has been a misunderstanding from the start.      “There seems to be miscommunication,” he told CoinDesk in an email. “Namebase is akin to Coinbase as they hold your keys. They’re a centralized service. They set up a domain that reroutes for [Alexandra Elbakyan]. She can buy her own name and do the exact same or they can gift her a TLD.”      Namebase founder Tieshun Roquerre further confirmed that there is currently an owner of the entire .hns domain, which “would like to stay anonymous.”      Read more: Handshake Goes Live With an Uncensorable Internet Browser      “They were in the process of transferring the TLD to Alexandra but once Alexandra learned that she could only own the entire TLD instead of just a single subdomain she decided not to manage it. On Handshake, you can own the TLD directly and control all subdomains,” he added.      ""Handshake is really focused in scope — it manages only the root domain extensions on-chain because that’s what’s required in order to decentralize the domain name system (DNS),"" Roquerre said. ""If the root of the tree isn’t decentralized then the entire system can’t be decentralized.""

42433493,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOS7vh,1610645368,Privacy Coin Firo Launches 'Privacy by Default' Protocol on Mainnet,"Privacy coin Firo, previously known as Zcoin, has launched the new protocol Lelantus on its mainnet.      The implementation introduces “on-by-default” privacy and prompts users to anonymize their funds with the goal of ensuring transactions sent by official Firo wallets stay private. Transparent transactions will now have to be explicitly selected. It also allows for partial redemptions of Firo’s burn-and-redeem model, which previously had to be redeemed in full.      When Lelantus launched on Firo’s testnet in October, Firo Project Steward Reuben Yap likened the burn-and-redeem model to buying a ticket for a carnival ride. When you go to the turnstile, you just have to show a ticket.    Read more: Zcoin Employs Burn-and-Redeem Privacy Model, Offering Alternative to Coinjoins    “The ticket acts like a receipt of payment, but it doesn’t have to show that I was the person who paid for it or the exact bank notes that were used to purchase it,” said Yap at the time. “The same principle is applied to the burn-and-redeem model for zcoins. As long as my receipt checks out, I can redeem it for new coins.”    Privacy coin ‘partial redemption’    With the Lelantus protocol launched on the mainnet, including partial redemption, that 24-hour ticket could be used for a few hours one day, none the next and then the remainder the following day.      “With previous burn-and-redeem systems such as Zerocoin and Sigma, if I burnt a $100 note I had to redeem a $100 note” said Yap. “Lelantus’ main innovation is that I can burn a $100 note and redeem any amount that is smaller without revealing that it even came from the $100 note.”    Read more: Cryptographers Are Always Going to Be ‘One Step Ahead’ of Regulators: Monero’s Spagni    This ability stops third parties from being able to narrow down the source of a transaction by the number of coins burned.      The next step for Lelantus, which Firo is already working on, is allowing users to “pass the right to redeem to someone else without revealing its source or amount,” according to the blog post announcing the mainnet launch.      The goal is to launch that function later this year.      ""As a result of the activation, we are starting to see increased transactions using Lelantus, which is very encouraging,"" said Yap in an email.      ""Mass adoption of cryptocurrencies cannot occur without meaningful privacy protections, especially given that no one wants their financial history open to the public, putting themselves at risk or exposing valuable information about themselves or businesses. Protocols like Lelantus open new doors to how cryptocurrencies approach transactional privacy, making those privacy protections all the more accessible and that adoption even more attainable.""",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | XMR,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/01/14/privacy-coin-firo-launches-privacy-by-default-protocol-on-mainnet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cf1c6f96363273961a2689615f2c7f95ab15a829-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The paxos standard (PAX) and paxos gold (PAXG) tokens are now available on Chainlink’s oracle network, according to a blog post shared early with CoinDesk. Chainlink operates as background pricing and data infrastructure for many DeFi projects and accounts for over 50% of on-chain smart contract calls among oracles, according to DeBank.      Paxos’ stablecoin tokens have mainly been playing catch-up since the DeFi spike in 2020. Of the top DeFi lending platforms according to DeFi Pulse, only MakerDAO currently offers PAX as a collateral type.      Moreover, stablecoins dai, usd coin (USDC) and tether make up the lion’s share of stablecoin activity on the Ethereum blockchain (where DeFi apps tend to live), according to data provider DeBank.      The addition of Paxos’ tokens to Chainlink’s feeds necessarily makes integration of new assets easier for each DeFi application leaning on the data provider. It also adds validity to the growing trend of real world assets making their way to the $21 billion DeFi market.

The New York-based firm – which was recently tapped to source PayPal’s cryptocurrency supply – holds a New York Trust charter. That means every crypto product addition is reviewed by the regulator, Hessert said.      Paxos’ bank accounts are also audited monthly by New Jersey-based accounting firm Withum. Those findings are pushed to Paxos’ API feed, which is then further routed to projects using Paxos’ tokens as collateral.      “Chainlink oracles will accelerate the adoption of Paxos’ [U.S. dollar] and gold-backed tokens in DeFi,” Hessert said in a statement. “With the proof of reserve and price available on-chain, our regulated assets will become more accessible for DeFi users.”",POSITIVE,PAXG,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | LINK | MARKET | PAXG,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/01/14/paxos-makes-fresh-push-for-defi-market-with-new-oracle-integration,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

42433489,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOS7jh,1610639269,DC Magistrate Judge Calls Unhosted Wallet 'Horror Story' a 'Fiction',"Federal Magistrate Judge Zia M. Faruqui has learned to stop worrying and love unhosted wallets.      “The horror story of unhosted wallets is fiction, not fact,” wrote the judge in a Jan. 6 memorandum opinion for D.C. District Court. He quoted a Coin Center thinkpiece (also named in Strangelovian fashion) on the downside of over-regulating unhosted wallets, then added his own summation:      “Indeed, cash poses a greater challenge to law enforcement than cryptocurrency in unhosted wallets.”      Delivered in a footnote to an opinion on a cryptocurrency forfeiture case, Faruqui’s assertion runs parallel to the debate currently roiling unhosted wallets. His memorandum does not directly mention the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network’s (FinCEN) mid-December call to monitor high-value private wallets through a controversial rule that’s set the cryptocurrency industry ablaze.      Read more: 7K Comments and Counting: Crypto Industry Fights ‘Arbitrary’ Treasury Rule      FinCEN wants exchanges to collect information on participants of $3,000+ cryptocurrency transactions that involve an unhosted wallet. It argues its proposed rule is “similar” to the anti-money-laundering regulations already governing cash transfers.      Faruqui’s opinion highlights the difference between untraceable cash and inherently traceable crypto. The blockchain may purport to grant individuals anonymity, he wrote. But he said law enforcement can use blockchain forensics tools to “unmask” those individuals (as they did in this case) with relative ease:      “Ironically, the public nature of the blockchain makes it exponentially easier to follow the flow of cryptocurrency over fiat funds.”      Ari Redbord, head of legal and government affairs at blockchain forensics company TRM Labs, said the opinion is a “significant” contribution from the federal judiciary, even if it carries little precedential weight. Redbord, who worked as an assistant U.S. Attorney for a decade, said few judges have the technical know-how to parse the complexities of crypto tracing, let alone cite tracing tools in a seizure order. That’s beginning to change with appointees like Faruqui, he said.      “You're seeing a new generation of federal judges who are coming on the bench and understanding these technologies,” Redbord said, adding that Faruqui was one of the federal government’s “foremost” crypto prosecutors before joining the judiciary in Sept. 2020.      Judges like Faruqui “understand that there are tools that can help law enforcement and financial institutions, understand them in a way that makes them a lot less dangerous than maybe a lot of people think,” Redbord said.      Faruqui’s opinion underscores the value unhosted wallets offer to law enforcement hoping to yank suspected criminals’ crypto away.      U.S. civil forfeiture law allows for the seizure of proceeds traceable to crime. That’s of particular importance in crypto prosecutions. With the blockchain documenting every step in an asset’s path, agents can identify so-called “tainted” coins, and (as was the case here) their owners, with a savviness usually impossible to replicate with cash. Once the illicit trail is established the forfeiture proceedings can promptly commence, no matter the wallet’s hosted status.      Property used to commit or promote a crime can also be subject to forfeiture proceedings. It’s this aspect that Faruqui ties specifically to unhosted wallets, writing that crypto’s pseudonymous nature “automatically justifies seizure of all unhosted funds as facilitating property.”      All this is ultimately to the benefit of a criminal’s victims, Faruqui said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/14/dc-magistrate-judge-calls-unhosted-wallet-horror-story-a-fiction,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/06f8b8e9a1098304b0150c56bdc10e2e0fc43973-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433501,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOS8Dh,1610633155,First Mover: Forget Facebook's Stablecoin. Now It's $700B Bitcoin in the Crosshairs,"Bitcoin (BTC) was higher, pushing back toward $40,000 after a 9.9% surge on Wednesday, the biggest calendar-day gain in a month.      Such a powerful recovery after a steep sell-off earlier in the week has quickly reinvigorated trader spirits. ""This bubble doesn't look set to burst,"" said Don Guo, CEO of Broctagon Fintech Group, which helps smaller cryptocurrency exchanges tap into bigger pools of liquidity available from large exchanges.      In traditional markets, U.S. government bond yields rose along with stocks after CNN reported that President-elect Joe Biden will unveil on Thursday a new coronavirus relief proposal, and that his advisers have told allies in Congress to expect a price tag around $2 trillion. Gold weakened 0.2% to $1,841 an ounce.    Market moves    Before the coronavirus hit last year, a big conversation among financial-industry executives, lawmakers and regulators was just how to regulate libra, the proposed digital currency from Facebook.      ""With Facebook's very large network of more than a billion people, a stablecoin could have systemic implications very quickly,"" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in a September 2019 webcast discussion in Zurich with Swiss National Bank Chairman Thomas Jordan. ""Libra would have to be held to the highest regulatory standards and expectations.""      Fast forward and the Facebook-sponsored token (since retooled and rebranded) still hasn't launched. Instead, it's now bitcoin, the original and largest cryptocurrency, suddenly attracting the overseers' notice.      Bitcoin is a ""highly speculative asset,"" European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said Wednesday at a Reuters event. According to the news service, she joined a number of regulators from across the world in calling for implementing global rules for cryptocurrencies.      “There has to be regulation,"" Lagarde said. ""This has to be applied and agreed upon.""      A doubling in prices for bitcoin in 2019, a quadrupling last year and another 32% gain just in the first two weeks of 2021 have quickly given the cryptocurrency a $709 billion market value.      Everybody knows bitcoin’s price is volatile, which was less of a concern a couple years ago when it was just one of those ""no value"" cryptocurrencies. A little extrapolation shows why the topic is getting harder to ignore.      Another quadrupling in price (hypothetically speaking of course) would push bitcoin's market capitalization to nearly $3 trillion. That's roughly the same amount of new money the Federal Reserve printed last year and then pumped into traditional financial markets last year to keep them from faltering.      A big number, in other words. So-called leveraged loans, which banks provide to junk-grade companies and then sell to investors for trading on Wall Street, grew so fast over the past decade that the Federal Reserve warned in early 2019 of the growing risks. The total outstanding amount of these junk loans currently stands at about $1.7 trillion.      With the coronavirus dimming the appeal of paper bills, central banks around the globe have accelerated efforts to develop or at least study digital versions of their own currencies. China's is already in trials. Earlier this week the Fed's New York branch, which handles the U.S. central bank's money-market operations, announced it had retained the recruiting firm Heidrick & Struggles to recruit an inaugural director for a planned New York Innovation Center, which will ""develop in-depth insights into critical trends in financial technology.""      A big dilemma regulators face is the Bitcoin blockchain was designed as an autonomous, peer-to-peer electronic payment system using distributed-ledger technology – theoretically beyond the control of any person, business or government. So the Fed can't just order bitcoin to stand down, as it essentially did to Facebook.      But according to a report published Wednesday by analysts with Macquarie, the big Australian investment bank, ""private cryptocurrencies"" like bitcoin are fast making inroads into electronic commerce, and it looks unlikely a digital dollar or digital euro could launch until 2022 at the earliest.      ""We think the use cases for private crypto could come to fruition if commerce becomes too accustomed to private crypto use prior to a central bank digital currency alternative launching as a stable, legitimate alternative,"" the Macquarie analysts wrote. ""U.S. regulatory officials wield quite a bit of power over how cryptos function and how their ecosystems develop. This becomes less meaningful as the network effect of cryptos grows, utility and acceptance broaden, and fiat potentially loses some demand for commerce.""      The acting U.S. comptroller of the currency, Brian Brooks, who is a former general counsel of the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, has used the final days of President Donald Trump's four-year term to expound on the virtues of cryptocurrencies.      ""Crypto is about freedom,"" Brooks said in a livestreamed event hosted by blockchain analysis firm Elliptic, as reported by CoinDesk's Nikhilesh De. In a Financial Times op-ed, Brooks wrote of the potential opportunity from ""self-driving banks"" built atop decentralized-finance networks.      ""Their greater efficiency would free significant amounts of capital that is lost to operating costs today or slowed by decisions dependent on human grey matter,"" Brooks argued. He plans to step down from the regulatory role on Thursday.      Charlie Morris, CEO of the cryptocurrency fund manager ByteTree, wrote Wednesday in his weekly newsletter that bitcoin might be ""ready to challenge the financial system.""      ""It is an open-source project, which has attracted some of the finest minds in the world,"" Morris wrote. ""This leads to continuous improvement, which means an infinite number of applications lie ahead. The massive development effort has centered around bitcoin, as opposed to other cryptos, because it dominates the ecosystem and faces the power laws behind the network effect.""      Also, Bloomberg News, citing a report from the publicly traded hedge fund Man Group, reported Wednesday that bitcoin differs from other investment bubbles like tulips, railroads and dot-com stocks, in that it has ""survived three peak-to-trough drawdowns of over 80%"" in fewer than 10 years.      Indeed, one thing that might be troubling regulators and bankers alike is the growing conviction among both crypto-industry executives and some big investors that the growth cycle in digital assets is still in its early stages.      ""How long until the entire legacy financial system migrates over to a digital Internet on the Web 3.0 based on distributed-ledger technology?"" Mati Greenspan, founder of the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency analysis firm Quantum Economics, wrote Wednesday. ""My feeling is that we're still early.""      - Bradley Keoun      Read More: Bitcoin in Race for Adoption Before Central Banks Launch Digital Currencies: Australia’s Macquarie    Bitcoin watch    Bitcoin jumped above $38,000 early Thursday, erasing a significant chunk of Monday's drop from $40,000 to $30,305.      However, the quick recovery has been charted on the back of low trading volumes, as noted by the crypto derivatives research firm Skew. A low-volume bounce is often short-lived.      That said, the options market is betting on a continued rally and is assigning a 20% probability of the cryptocurrency rising above $50,000 by Jan. 29 (monthly expiry).      The 20% probability looks impressive, considering the monthly expiry is just two weeks away, and the cryptocurrency is currently down 31% from $50,000.      The bullish sentiment is quite strong, as indicated by increased demand for higher strike call options.      “In the past 24 hours, the $52,000 call option has registered a buying volume of 2,059 contracts.

42433497,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOS83h,1610632991,FinCEN Extends Comment Period for Controversial Crypto Wallet Rule,"The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) said Thursday it would reopen its proposed rulemaking period for an additional 15 days for its reporting requirements, and another 45 days for a requirement on recordkeeping and counterparty reporting requirements.      First submitted Dec. 18, the proposals would require exchanges to store name and address information for customers transferring over $3,000 in crypto per day to private crypto wallets, and file currency transaction reports (CTRs) for customers transacting in over $10,000 per day.      Critics of the rule said it would be technically impossible for some projects to comply because smart contracts and author-decentralized tools do not have name or address information to provide.      Perhaps most important, the extension means Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who is said to be spearheading this effort, will be out of office by the time the comments period closes, perhaps allowing for FinCEN to better incorporate industry feedback.      In its public notice, FinCEN wrote that the proposed CTR requirements “are essentially equivalent to the existing CTR reporting requirements that apply to transactions in currency,” and called the proposal “vital” to closing loopholes that terrorists or other malicious actors might use. This is the part that will see a 15-day extension for comments.      FinCEN was less effusive about the recordkeeping and counterparty details, only writing, “FinCEN is providing a longer period in light of the somewhat greater complexity of those aspects of the proposed rule and various issues identified in comments received during the original comment period.”      This was the part that raised the most controversy from the industry, receiving over 7,000 comments, with the majority of responders criticizing the rule or the speed by which it was being pushed through.      In a statement, the Chamber of Digital Commerce said if the proposed rule was implemented as-is, ""a series of unintended consequences that raise serious privacy concerns would have resulted from this rushed rulemaking process.""      The extension doesn’t mean the rule will not be implemented; it’s still entirely possible that FinCEN will choose to run with the rule after the final version is published.      The clock restarts when the document is published in the Federal Register, the nation’s logbook. According to public documents, this will be Jan. 15.      Dayton Young, product director at Fight for the Future, welcomed the extension in a statement, saying, ""we're calling on the Biden-Harris Administration to listen to the public and reject the previous administration's assault on our privacy rights. We need more than just a change in leadership at the Treasury; we need a change in values and ideology if we hope to stop financial surveillance.""

42433482,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOS7bh,1610632804,"Fireblocks Rolls Out Staking Rewards for Eth 2.0, Polkadot and Tezos","Announced Thursday, Fireblocks is partnering with staking infrastructure providers Staked and Blockdaemon to offer hosted proof-of-stake (PoS) services for Ethereum 2.0 and the popular Polkadot (DOT) and Tezos (XTZ) tokens.      Fireblocks, which raised $30 million in funding in November last year, uses a technique called multi-party computation (MPC) that protects cryptographic keys by splitting them into pieces, and which the company says is well suited to the dynamic business of blockchain token staking.      “We are launching staking wallets to Fireblocks customers who collectively hold a significant balance of crypto assets,” Fireblocks CEO Michael Shaulov said in an interview. He said that while the majority of Fireblocks' over 165 clients have bitcoin, “between DOT, XTZ and ETH we have over $1 billion of assets"" that can be staked.      The custodian’s clients include some of the large crypto lenders such as Celsius, BlockFi, Salt and Nexo. Fireblocks also provides custody to U.K.-based firms Revolut and B2C2, as well as Coinflex, Galaxy and a lot of smaller crypto hedge funds, Shaulov said.    Read more: Digital Asset Firm Fireblocks Raises $30M to Gird for ‘Influx in Customer Demand’    By participating in blockchain staking, token holders are required to have skin in the game by committing some of their assets on the network to verify transactions. Network validators can earn between 10%-15% yield on those assets, a tempting proposition for financial institutions in the current no-interest climate.      More broadly, participants are betting on the next generation of finance; backing a given economic system is analogous, in some respects, to the way banks are required to post capital reserves in the traditional financial world today.      Generating and managing various sets of validation and withdrawal keys is not for the layman, but the biggest pain about staking is maintaining constantly available infrastructure to verify transactions. Failure to do so results in a slashing of the validator’s stake.      “For our clients, from an operational or technical standpoint, it’s actually transparent,” said Shaulov. “They don’t need to do anything special. When they sign the delegation message, we select the infrastructure and switch into the optimized nodes.”      In return for maintaining the service, Fireblocks takes a 10% slice of the yield the staker earns.    Read more: Digital Bank Revolut Taps Fireblocks to Support New Crypto-Based Services    Shaulov sees the new service as a way of inviting retail investors to get more involved in staking. Celsius and others are retail gateways, he pointed out. “Our customers that are retail-facing are planning to basically act as a gateway and roll out Eth 2 staking to generate the market for retail investors that are long on ETH,” Shaulov said.      Such an invitation to retail involvement could be a step towards a fintech app approach to crypto staking. So, is this a conversation Fireblocks is having with customers like Revolut, for instance, which allows users to buy and hold crypto?      “I think they [Revolut] have a roadmap of things set out ahead that are perhaps less advanced, but they are interested in looking at it,” Shaulov said. “Part of the reason we are releasing it is because of how compelling it is to fintech companies like Revolut and others.”",POSITIVE,DOT | ETH | XTZ,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | DOT | ETH | XTZ,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/01/14/fireblocks-rolls-out-staking-rewards-for-eth-20-polkadot-and-tezos,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3b57a44d918bba9b30d9ce120390f65ca7623f8c-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433499,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOS89h,1610632174,"Twitter, Trump and the 'Private Company' Fallacy","In the wake of the coordinated deplatformings of President Trump, his associates and various conservatives from all manner of internet platforms and services, a common line of justification has been that these internet firms are merely “private companies,” and hence free to do whatever they like. Of course, no firms are truly autonomous in the modern state. From COVID-19 to civil rights, how firms can do business, and with whom, is very much a state concern.      But the censorship apologists are right in a narrow sense, at least under our current laws: Firms like Twitter are acting within their rights when they kick someone off. But the “private company” line is worth interrogating. It implies a kind of anarcho-capitalist paradise, where firms are sovereign and the sole masters of their own destinies.    CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter is partner at Castle Island Ventures, a public blockchain-focused venture fund based in Cambridge, Mass. He is also the co-founder of Coin Metrics, a blockchain analytics startup.    Of course, it’s curious in the extreme that mainstream liberals – historically, an ideology concerned about corporate overreach – are now fond of libertarian talking points. But leaving aside their oddly convenient newfound affinity for anarcho-capitalist principles, the concept of a “private company” deserves interrogation.      Clearly, companies aren’t independent of the state. They exist in a distinct legal and political context. They are obliged to follow local laws. The claim that private organizations have total discretion over with whom they do business doesn’t stack up in America. My local gym, closed by mandate, is a testament to that, as is the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Now, conservatives or other individuals with disfavored political views are not a protected class. But the strong form of corporate independence is nonetheless vacuous. The state has, on many occasions, sought to determine who companies can and cannot do business with. These protected classes change frequently too, with new entrants being added to the list all the time.      But let’s continue to entertain the idea that these internet firms are acting in a manner that is entirely consistent with the letter and spirit of U.S. laws. Could it be the case they are nonetheless beholden to the state and hence not “private” in a meaningful sense?      See also: Nic Carter - Nationalizing Stablecoins Won’t Improve Financial Access      Consider for a moment how you would act if you were a foreign government and all of your citizens used social media apps built in Silicon Valley. At this point, you are exposed to the caprice of a tiny handful of self-appointed bureaucrats who can deplatform you at any time, suppress the speech of your citizens and even algorithmically promote narratives that are hostile to your interests. And they would be fully within their rights to do so. Indeed, the heads of state of Germany, the U.K., Poland, Mexico and Hungary have recently expressed alarm at the aggressive censorship efforts of American internet firms. Angela Merkel is no fan of Trump, but even she was perturbed by the ability of a faceless “trust and safety” committee to cut off the prime communication channel of the most powerful man in the world. Merkel is just looking out for her own interests: if Trump can be silenced by a cartel of Silicon Valley internet firms, so, too, can she or any other politician.      In the face of this potential liability, world leaders could shut down the internet and wall their citizens off from the world. Alternatively, they could brew their own state-sanctioned, siloed social media. Or, if they were more resourceful, they could infiltrate these internet oligopolies and put them to work in their favor. If successful, these internet firms could be deputized into becoming agents of the state. Far-fetched? Available evidence suggests that not only is this plausible but it has in fact happened.      As internet platforms offer extreme leverage to control speech and discourse, capturing them is a prime objective for autocrats. It’s no secret that ByteDance, ostensibly a “private company,” acts as an extension of the Chinese state, happily censoring topics relating to Falun Gong, Tibet or Tiananmen Square or the repression of the Uighur minority. Even U.S.-domiciled companies like Zoom have been deputized by the Chinese state. Zoom is as American as it comes, trading on the Nasdaq, headquartered in San Jose, incorporated in Delaware, and founded by the Chinese-American Eric Yuan. Despite this, Zoom has been employed for further CCP aims, banning the accounts of U.S.-based individuals and organizations who discussed Tiananmen Square on the platform.    While you may be sympathetic to the entities deplatforming their political opponents, think twice when you justify the behavior with reference to 'private firms.' There really is no such thing.    In many cases, the capture is purely economic and quite explicit. Google is a prime example. From 2002 to 2010, after which it was blocked in China, Google happily adhered to Chinese censorship requirements. In 2016, in a bid to return to China, the firm resumed work on a censored version of its project, dubbed Dragonfly. And who can forget the National Basketball Association siding with its lucrative Chinese audience over Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey?      Perhaps most explosively, from 2013 to 2015, Twitter was successfully infiltrated by Saudi Arabia, which placed operatives in the social media company and used them to de-anonymize and target accounts critical of the Saudi regime.      Now, you may respond that the Twitter scandal was an isolated incident in which only a few staff were co-opted. But we only know of the cases where covers were blown. Quite simply, if internet oligopolies are furthering state objectives, they must be considered private-sector state proxies. The staff do not have to be fully compromised for this capture to occur. Because the “trust and safety” teams are private, and censorship deliberations are opaque, it’s easy to insert political discretion into platforming decisions while portraying them as the mere execution of rules.      The revolving door between top executives at internet oligopolies and the new Biden Administration further calls into question the “private companies” concept. Private-sector firms do not need to be explicitly nationalized to further state interests; it’s enough to install their alumni in top regulatory positions. As a consequence, the prospects for genuine antitrust enforcement – the most promising tool to defang internet platform monopolies – look extremely dim. Amazon’s deplatforming of the tiny, but defiant social network Parler should be interpreted as a preemptive gift to the coming administration. The message sent: “Don’t break us up, we will promote your ideological agenda by preemptively shutting down platforms for dissent.” No lawmaking required. Enlisting the private sector to engage in censorship by proxy is a clever constitutional end-around, for now.      The informal but coordinated deplatforming of politically disfavored firms by internet platforms is reminiscent of another case study in which the state exercised extrajudicial control over the private sector without explicit rulemaking: the Obama-era program to control bank activity called Operation Choke Point. This program, which ran from 2012 to 2015, was an extrajudicial campaign originating in the Department of Justice aimed at shutting down politically disfavored but legal industries, starting with payday lending. The DOJ imposed policy not through formal legal means, but instead by weaponizing the FDIC and insinuating to banks that they would be hit with expensive subpoenas if they didn’t sanction “high-risk” payment processor activities. These payment processors, in turn, had no choice but to deplatform the (legal) industries in question: ammunition sales, gun manufacturers, fireworks manufacturers, escort services, pornography, debt consolidation firms, coin dealers and many others. These industries were chosen arbitrarily – a conservative administration running the same playbook might have have chosen to deplatform legal but politically disfavored businesses like abortion clinics or transgender counseling services, for instance.      Through Choke Point, payment processors, superficially “private companies,” were effectively strong-armed into refusing to platform certain firms. They had no choice because their core bank relationships were at stake.      Although, under pressure, the FDIC withdrew its guidance to banks in 2015, Choke Point never really ended. Wary of future crackdowns, payment processors continued to refuse to do business with firms they felt might land them in hot water with banks (and ultimately, the state). Every entrepreneur in the crypto industry has felt this keenly. And it looks very likely that the banks will once again be weaponized to interfere with the private sector. Banks are demonstrably not private companies; they are better understood as public-private partnerships, being granted the ability to create money in exchange for heavy regulation. Bank charters are strictly limited and difficult to obtain. Being highly regulated and consolidated, the financial sector is an easy target for the state to use as a tool of power projection. We can expect this form of power project to resume shortly under Biden.      Additionally, Big Tech is at a zenith in power, which ironically grants the state more scope for control. Collectively, the FAANMG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Microsoft and Google) represent 23% of the value of the entire S&P 500. The relative dominance of the largest publicly traded firms is currently at a level not seen since the ‘60s.      If it is the state’s role to constrain corporate power, then it has manifestly failed to do. Refusing to limit the power of the platform monopolies has granted them a distinct advantage and landed us in a neo-Gilded Age. With the implicit threat of antitrust hanging over these internet platforms, the new administration can expect compliance, even without explicit rule-making.      See also: Nic Carter - After the Twitter Hack, We Need a User-Owned Internet More Than Ever      Lastly, and most important, the state is today simply more influential in the economy than it has been in generations. Massive spending in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis, combined with a crunch in consumption, saw the state’s spending grow to an eye-watering 55% of gross domestic product in Q2 2020. This means that over half the value of economic output of the economy was attributable to government spending.      These levels of state intervention into the economy have not been seen since World War II. With massive expenditure comes control. Effectively, the economy has been transformed from a somewhat free market to one in which the state largely determines economic outcomes. In this context, no “free enterprise” or “private sector” can meaningfully exist. Corporate activity today involves jostling for position around the monetary and fiscal feeding trough. Political connectedness increasingly determines trajectories in today’s economy.      So while you may be sympathetic to the entities deplatforming their political opponents, think twice when you justify the behavior with reference to “private firms.” There really is no such thing.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Nic Carter,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/01/14/twitter-trump-and-the-private-company-fallacy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/537855cd3c7b72d38ed95d298d2c74c396b9ca00-1200x850.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, this time he is offering the local government in Newport, Wales, a reward of 25% of the bitcoin on that hard drive, which he said would go to a Covid Relief Fund for the city's residents, reports the South Wales Argus.

Bitcoin prices have climbed from $10,000 to $41,000 over the past three months.

Bitcoin dropped from $40,000 to $30,305 on Monday on heavy selling in the spot market, most notably on the U.S.-based Coinbase exchange.      Despite the recovery, the cryptocurrency is still well short of the record high of $41,962 registered on Jan. 8.      Options market data shows investors are betting on a continued rally and are assigning a 20% probability of the cryptocurrency rising above $50,000 by Jan. 29 (monthly expiry), according to data provided by the crypto derivatives research firm Skew.      Option probabilities are calculated using the Black-Scholes formula based on critical metrics such as call options' prices, strike prices, the price of the underlying asset and the ""risk-free"" interest rate on investments as U.S. Treasurys and the time to maturation.      Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option represents a right to buy, and a put option gives the right to sell.      The 20% probability of bitcoin rising above $50,000 by Jan. 29 looks impressive, considering the monthly expiry is just two weeks away and the cryptocurrency is currently down 31% from $50,000. The likelihood of bitcoin rising above a certain level on or before the expiry is positively correlated to the time left for expiry.      While a 31% rally to $50,000 in two weeks may be challenging to envision, it is far from impossible, as noted by Deribit Insights. The cryptocurrency has charted more significant moves in the recent past. For instance, prices rose 52% from $19,000 to $29,000 in the last two weeks of December alone.      The bullish momentum would again gather pace if institutional inflows resume, Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank, told CoinDesk on Wednesday. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the biggest publicly traded crypto investment trust, reopened Tuesday after a month-long break. Inflows into Grayscale hold the key to a bitcoin price rally, as per investment banking giant JPMorgan. Grayscale, like CoinDesk, is owned by Digital Currency Group.      Also, U.S. president-elect Joe Biden is expected to announce a $2 trillion stimulus on Thursday, strengthening the cryptocurrency's long-term bullish case. Bitcoin is considered a hedge against monetary and fiscal indiscipline by prominent public-listed companies such as MicroStrategy.    Call options in demand    The one-, three- and six-month put-call skews, which measure the cost of puts relative to calls, remain entrenched into the negative territory, according to Skew data. That's a sign of calls or bullish bets drawing higher demand than puts.      The one-month put-call skew has declined to a lifetime low of -35.9, indicating record bullish sentiment. Investors have been buying the $52,000 call expiring on Jan. 29 since Tuesday.      Also read: Trading Hall of Fame: The Bitcoin Options Bet That Made $58.2M Profit on Just $638K      ""In the past 24 hours, the $52,000 call option has registered a buying volume of 2,059 contracts. Meanwhile, the $36,000 call has seen a buying volume of 1211 contracts,"" Swiss-based data analytics platform Laevitas told CoinDesk.

The company said the introduction of the credit card has been accelerated with the acquisition of the fintech startup Blockrize and will be made available to U.S. citizens in all states.  According to Gemini, the card will work like a traditional card and will be widely accepted where major cards are accepted and the rewards will be automatically deposited into a cardholder’s Gemini account.  Using the Blockrize rewards program, cardholders will be able to earn up to 3% back in bitcoin, or other cryptocurrencies, on every purchase they make with the Gemini Credit Card, said the firm.  Gemini said it has opened the Gemini Credit Card waitlist which allows its current customers, and those already on the Blockrize waitlist, with early access to the credit card.  ""The Gemini Credit Card will make it easier for any consumer to invest in bitcoin and other cryptos without changing their existing behavior, “ said Tyler Winklevoss, CEO of Gemini.  In December, cryptocurrency lender BlockFi announced it will launch its rewards credit card in the first quarter of this year calling it the first of its kind in an industry that is already saturated with bitcoin reward debit cards.  Gemini’s acquisition of Blockrize is the firm’s second acquisition, following its acquisition of Nifty Gateway in November 2019.  The Nifty Gateway uses the Gemini infrastructure on the backend for a dollar-exchange platform allowing users to buy non-fungible token (NFTs) with credit cards and cash out directly to their bank accounts when they sell.  Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss are longtime cryptocurrency investors and the co-founders of Gemini, an exchange that gives users the ability to buy, sell, and store digital assets.

42385613,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2S65,1610586968,"'Was This Correct?' Twitter's Dorsey Asks About Banning Trump, and Then Says 'Yes'","Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey took to (where else?) Twitter to ask the question, ""Was this correct?"" regarding his company's decision to ban U.S. President Donald Trump from the platform following last week's attack on the Capitol.  After that opening expression of doubt, he proceeded to answer that yes, it was.    Dorsey then, in a thoughtful, multipart thread, laid out his rationale for the action, trying to square his belief in open unfiltered communication with the act of silencing the president of the U.S.  The Twitter CEO also seemed to reference the recent removal of Parler, a conservative social media platform, from both the Apple and Google app stores in the wake of the attack on the Capitol as well as Amazon's decision not to host Parler on its servers for the same reason, hitting back at claims the action was coordinated by the tech giants.  ""I do not believe this was coordinated,"" Dorsey said. ""More likely companies came to their own conclusions or were emboldened by the actions of others.""  Despite the CEO's defense of Twitter's and other companies' actions in the here and now, Dorsey warned they should not become the rule. ""This moment in time might call for this dynamic, but over the long term it will be destructive to the noble purpose and ideals of the open internet.""  Even while laying out his justifications Dorsey expressed misgivings, saying, ""[H]aving to ban an account has real and significant ramifications."" It, Dorsey said, ""sets a precedent I feel is dangerous: the power an individual or corporation has over a part of the global public conversation.""  Even though there's a difference between a private company banning someone and a government doing it, the effect can feel the same, he said.  He also declared his ""passion"" for Bitcoin in almost lyrical fashion.  Bitcoin, he wrote, offers a model of ""a foundational internet technology that is not controlled or influenced by any single individual or entity. This is what the internet wants to be, and over time, more of it will be.""    UPDATE (Jan. 14, 02:00 UTC): Adds more from Dorsey's tweet thread and deplatforming context.
