42400193,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIt4a,1500497098,$30 Million: Ether Reported Stolen Due to Parity Wallet Breach,"Smart contract coding company Parity has issued a security alert, warning of a vulnerability in version 1.5 or later of its wallet software.  So far, 150,000 ethers, worth $30 million, have been reported by the company as stolen, data confirmed by Etherscan.io. As reported by the startup, the issue is the result of a bug in a specific multi-signature contract known as wallet.sol. Data suggests the issue was mitigated, however, as 377,000 ethers that were potentially vulnerable to the issue were recovered by white hat hackers.  Parity ranked the severity of the bug as ""critical"" in its public remarks, urging ""any user with funds in a multi-sig wallet"" move their funds to a secure address.  According to Parity founder and CTO Gavin Wood, at least three ether addresses have been compromised as a result of the bug.  Writing in the Parity Gitter channel, Wood said:  ""There is an effort by the foundation underway to secure funds in other wallets to prevent any further compromises; they will make an announcement in their own time.""  On social media, notable blockchain specialists are already weighing in on the situation, with Proof of Existence creator Manual Araoz suggesting that the compromised addresses could potentially belong to notable owners.  Specifically, he identified Edgeless Casino, Swarm City, and æternity – three recent initial coin offering projects built on ethereum – as potentially having been compromised in the thefts.  As of press time, Swarm City had confirmed the loss of 44,055 ETH. Edgeless Casino and æternity have not yet given any official comment.  Overall, it's the latest security setback for an ethereum project in recent days, following a hack on CoinDash in which $10 million was stolen in an ICO earlier this week.

42400185,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIszf,1500494352,'Mistake' Corrected: Overstock Invests in Blockchain Startup Symbiont,"The blockchain branch of retail giant Overstock today announced its first investment in Symbiont, a startup aimed at streamlining the way financial instruments are traded.  The investment by Overstock's Medici Ventures in Symbiont, for undisclosed terms, is being positioned by both firms as the beginning of a collaborative effort to bring to life a new era of securities traded directly on a blockchain.  But the investment almost didn't happen. Earlier this year, Medici president Jonathan Johnson had considered joining an earlier round, only to pass on the opportunity — it turns out, temporarily.  Medici Ventures president Jonathan Johnson explained how Symbiont fits into the company’s portfolio, and why they decided to pass on the company the first time around.  He told CoinDesk:  ""We made a mistake.""  Founded in 2015, Symbiont has raised a total of about $7 million to build out private blockchain solutions, including most recently an undisclosed amount from Hundsun, a tech firm backed by Alibaba founder Jack Ma.  Earlier this month, Symbiont was among several organizations involved in helping push for blockchain regulation in the State of Delaware, which celebrated the successful passage of the amendments.  Both Symboint and fellow Medici Ventures portfolio company T0 stand to benefit from the amendments that explicitly recognized a corporation’s right to use a blockchain to track stock shares.  Even as Johnson acknowledged that the companies' work with stocks was ""somewhat competitive,"" he distinguished Symbiont’s Orebits work with selling gold on a blockchain and other initiatives as potentially being of use to each other.  ""There's some overlap,"" said Johnson. ""But we see them as mostly complimentary.""  Blockchain strategy  In contrast to Medici Ventures investments in Bitt and T0, which Johnson described as involving a ""significant role,"" he said his firm’s work with Symbiont is of a more strategic nature.  Symbiont president Caitlin Long elaborated on what that means when she told CoinDesk the investment conversation was ""resurrected"" in the build-up to the passage of the Delaware amendments.  In conversation, Long said that while Symbiont wants to be the first private company to move all its shares to a blockchain, Medici parent Overstock wants to be the first public company to do so.  She concluded:  ""They put a proposal on the table about three weeks ago, and moved very quickly once we both realized we wanted to do this.""

According to a congressional record released online today, Roger Williams, a congressman from the 25th district of Texas, issued the comments as an addendum to a July 8th hearing in the House of Representatives.  Entitled ""Virtual Currency: Financial Innovation and National Security Implications,"" the hearing was held by Subcommittee on Terrorism and Illicit Finance of the House Financial Services Committee.  Williams began his addition to the public remarks by acknowledging cryptocurrencies are ""recreating the structures of international finance"" and that they ""offer many exciting opportunities,"" but said protections need to be enforced.  He went on to stress that the government must ensure that the rising use of digital currency does not ""aid the actions of terrorists and criminals.""  Williams said:  ""Unless we in Congress develop rational and balanced policies, we may be enabling the very terrorists who wish to destroy us.""  The congressman argued that the compliance requirements applied to other financial institutions should be applied to digital currencies.  To sum up his argument, he said, ""Some in the digital currency world argue that digital finance requires a relaxation of these standards. This is absolutely incorrect.""

42400190,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIt5Z,1500478541,Mystery Coinbase Customer Steps up in Fight to Quash IRS Tax Hunt,"Coinbase users aren't backing down from an effort to shoot down an IRS subpoena seeking customer names and transaction data for an investigation on their potential tax liabilities.  According to a new filing in the case, the U.S. Northern district court of California has granted a motion on behalf of a fourth anonymous Coinbase customer, identified as John Doe 4 in the documents, to challenge the IRS summon, first filed in November last year as reported previously.  Since then, there have been notable developments as it relates to the plaintiffs in the lawsuit.  After one customer Jeffrey Berns went public with his bid to challenge the tax hunt, for example, the IRS withdrew inquiries on him specifically as his identity was already revealed.  The counteraction led to several precedent anonymous users named John Doe 1, 2, 3, to continue the effort to scrap the case.  The filing shows the IRS subsequently narrowed down the criteria in its summon to disqualify John Doe 1, 2, 3 for filing motions to intervene, by focusing on users who had sent transactions totaling over $20,000.  The district court also detailed four factors in determining whether the right to intervene should be granted, and consequently decided that John Doe 4 met all factors.  As a result, John Doe 4 is now allowed to represent users in a motion to challenge the IRS petition, and do so anonymously.

42400182,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIswi,1500471907,Research Finds Design Flaws in Scaling Proposal Bitcoin Unlimited,"A new research paper from international analyst group IMEC has found that changes to bitcoin proposed by a software implementation called Bitcoin Unlimited would ""magnify the effectiveness"" of attacks on the network.  An alternative version of the software, Bitcoin Unlimited emerged in 2016 as an effort by like-minded developers and startups that sought to replace bitcoin's hard-coded block size, the center of the sprawling scaling debate, with a new concept called ""emergent consensus.""  As outlined in our CoinDesk Explainer, the idea was that, rather than having rules like block size specified directly in the code, nodes and miners could be made to converge on bitcoin's rules naturally, using free market principles.  However, using game theoretic modeling, the IMEC study finds miners with the economic resources to support larger data blocks have ""both the incentive and the ability"" to force out smaller miners from the network. The researchers used two models as a proxy for the ""social choice"" involved in this decision-making, testing how the idea would function in both secure and challenging conditions.  Specifically, the report found that by having miners and nodes signal both an ""excessive block size"" and ""maximum acceptable block size"" as a means to determine the rules, new attack vectors would open, essentially letting miners ""deliberately fork the network"" if desired.  ""Our results ... prove that forks happen frequently when the attacker's block size is flexible,"" the report authors state.  The study ultimately finds that the nature of the bitcoin mining business, in which various entities compete for rewards using pools of computing power, means miners capable of supporting large blocks can collude to force peers out of competition.  ""During the transition period, people might broadcast different [excessive block sizes] to advocate their preferred block size and threaten other miners, leaving the system in a vulnerable state. Moreover, if block size keeps rising in the system, eventually some public nodes will not be able to handle these large blocks and the decentralized nature of bitcoin is damaged,"" the paper continues, adding:  ""In other words, in BU, the profit-driven nature of miners is inconsistent with bitcoin's decentralized philosophy.""  Even in separate tests where it was assumed miners were compliant with protocol rules, analysis found that ""strategic"" miners could gain block rewards ""unproportional to their mining power"" and trigger ""long forks ... more easily and more frequently"" than under the constraints of the software's current design.  Ultimately, the paper finds that the security implications of such a change have ""not been thoroughly analyzed.""  Open questions  Penned by researchers Ren Zhang and Bart Preneel, the paper provides a refreshingly scientific context to a technical side of a debate often defined by vitriol. Though, it's one that likely impacts the politics of the issue as well.  A potential issue critics may find with the paper is that it appears to assume a more decentralized network, in which smaller node operates would still be considered as providing a valuable service to the protocol. This is notable as proponents of larger blocks have long sought to downplay the impact of high node operation costs.  Indeed, a fundamental divide between the two camps ideologically appears to be their views on miner and node consolidation, with developers seeing this as antithetical to bitcoin's value proposition, while startups have seemed more accepting of the trend as a side-effect of economics and business.  Still, it remains to be seen just what the impact will be, given that the network is close to activating an alternative proposal. Called Segwit2x, the proposal would enact Segregated Witness, a code change proposed by bitcoin's current open-source development team.  At press time, just 10.75 percent of nodes were signaling for the Bitcoin Unlimited implementation, according to an online data source.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which helped organize the Segwit2x agreement.

42400166,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIrTD,1500469525,Building a Blockchain Strategy? Deloitte's CTO Has Advice For You,"As one of the earliest enterprise firms to specialize in blockchain, Deloitte has quickly become a fixture in industry news and at conferences. But just how important is the emerging technology to its business?  For context, despite generating $36 billion in revenue last year, the ""Big Four"" auditing firm has invested in just one blockchain startup. Further, it has only officially opened two blockchain labs – with a third soon to be launched.  In this light, Deloitte's investment strategy might seem like a small series of shots in the dark. But the truth, according to Deloitte Consulting's chief technology officer, Bill Briggs is that it's anything but.  In an exclusive interview, Briggs described how an elaborate series of programs not only helped his firm decide how to invest in blockchain, but also proved instrumental in getting the firm into blockchain in the first place.  Briggs told CoinDesk:  ""We're creating value maps to bring to light an industry for a given domain, function, process; where are the places that have concrete, simple to understand, no-regret value?""  Briggs estimates that 70 percent of Deloitte’s investments are made in these easy-to-understand product-market fits, with the remaining 30 percent focused on less certain, more experimental prospects.  ""The further out you get, no one has the answer,"" said Briggs.  Data vacuum  At the core of the strategy are a number steps designed to tap into the wisdom of the crowd. But, it's not just any crowd that generates Deloitte's investment data.  Rather, the global consultancy that employs 244,000 people has established a network of cells around the world that scan for the latest blockchain trends culled from data created by its own personnel.  Founded in October 2015, Deloitte's S3 group consists of strategic analysts whose sole job is to ""sense, scout and scan"" global financial services. Based in New York City, the team of three analysts gathers original data from events, clients, startups and paid data sources like DataFox to look for potentially valuable patterns.  This investment due diligence considers variables including the potential of an idea based on its market size, unit economics and market traction.  Then those trends are ""populated"" into Deloitte's Ecosystem Relationship Management Platform (a development of the customer relationship management, or CRM, concept already in wide use across sectors) and sent directly to select groups of the firm's employees. These groups, in turn, provide feedback based on experience related to the trends.  Similarly, Deloitte's Innovation Tech Terminal ""scouting service,"" based in Tel Aviv, Israel, has been working sincehttps://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/press-releases/deloitte-innovation-tech-terminal.html last November to further align Deloitte’s own investment strategy with that of its clients by helping identify startups that the consulting firm's clients can back.  ""It's a back and forth mechanism all the time,"" said Deloitte global blockchain leader, Eric Piscini. ""But the crowd-sourcing is important, because that's how you leverage the industry knowledge of the Deloitte practice.""  Aligning interests  The blockchain investment research being done in these two cells is then mirrored by groups dispersed throughout Deloitte's global staff.  While S3 is focused exclusively on blockchain and other fintech applications, Briggs also helps manage what he calls a ""sophisticated tracking function that looks at widespread investment opportunities"" at a global scale.  Through a combination of client briefings as well as meetings with venture capitalists and private equity firms, ""small cohorts"" gather investment strategies and information on which geographic regions might be in the early stages of showing proficiency in a particular skill set.  The data extracted from these meetings is qualitatively different than elsewhere because it is derived from sources that, by the nature of their own due-diligence practices, are privy to trends arising at the earliest stages of startups' development.  ""It's a win-win,"" said Briggs. ""It doesn't just make us smarter, but we're going to inform your investments and help them scale faster.""  Investing decisions  Back in early 2015, the concept of blockchain percolated up through Deloitte’s investment research machinery and passed the test to become one of the rare new verticals to receive investment by the firm.  Though the exact amount of capital Deloitte has so far invested in the sector is still being closely protected, Briggs elaborated for the first time how that money is being spent.  Typically, Deloitte prefers to invest directly in its clients, in what Briggs called ""risk-based sharing or value-based outcome,"" to help drive and accelerate adoption in ""places we believe in.""  Typically, those investments tend to be in services-heavy startups aimed at growing their client base. But at this early stage of blockchain adoption, Deloitte has only publicly revealed direct investments in one blockchain startup, financial infrastructure provider SETL, and one educational institution dealing in blockchain, Singularity University.  Instead of investing directly in companies, Deloitte has largely opted to invest in regions deemed as fertile for blockchain development, with an aim to grow the pool of talent and deepen the data considered for possible future investment opportunities.  ""We mix data-driven sensing and market analysis with the instincts of our global experts and practice leaders,"" said Briggs, who further explained:  ""Increasingly we are co-investing with our clients, alliances, and ecosystems – whether that be outcome-based deal structures, joint development of products or hybrid offerings, equity positions, or acquisitions. ""  Future plans  Briggs cited initial blockchain momentum in the financial sectors of Dublin and New York City, and the cross-industry potential to expand into other sectors as crucial reasons behind the decision to invest in the construction of dedicated blockchain labs in those regions.  As revealed to CoinDesk, Deloitte's latest investment is in a third lab, this time in Hong Kong.  Following on from a blockchain test conducted by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Deloitte and others, the lab is already ""open, but not launched yet,"" according to Briggs.  When the lab launches this September, the goal will be two-fold: to teach others how to build with blockchain, and to learn what to invest in next.  Briggs concluded:  ""Whenever the market and client needs are aligned with our own growth and investments, goodness happens.""

The conversation on how to best upgrade the bitcoin network to accommodate a greater transaction capacity has been a long one, dating back to the earliest forums and message boards. However, it wasn't until 2014 that the idea that bitcoin's technology may need to adapt to increasing usage entered the industry spotlight.  Since then, there's been a heated, seemingly non-stop debate that, at best, has showcased the depth and creativity of the developers working on the open-source project, and at worst, has shown the damage a 24-hour online commentary can have on scientific pursuits.  Now, as the scaling debate heads to what could be a notable milestone, CoinDesk looks back at the major stories that have shaped the narrative.

42400162,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIrPH,1500462016,Exchange Trade Group: Jurisdiction is Challenging DLT Adoption,"A new report by a global industry association for securities exchanges has focused on blockchain adoption issues among its members.  A response to a discussion paper on distributed ledger technology (DLT) proposed by the U.K. securities watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) paper cites jurisdictional issues as the biggest inherent challenge for the wider adoption of what are, by nature, decentralized, cross-border systems.  While this is not the first time WFE has commented on the use of DLT by security exchanges, it is now focusing on regulatory areas that ""need to be addressed or clarified"" to enable use cases of interest to its members.  The report noted:  ""It is important to have certainty regarding the legal status of digitized assets as a means of transferring and granting security over interests in such assets, as well as treatment in insolvency, and applicability of insolvency protection.""  According to the association, its members include worldwide security exchanges from developed and emerging markets, such as Nasdaq and the Shanghai Stock Exchange.  Call for standards  The response also pointed to the lack of a standard legal status for cryptocurrencies among central banks as a challenge for cross-border transactions among exchanges.  The paper argued, for example, that it remains unclear just how transactions made on a digital ledger infrastructure would be treated from a legal perspective.  ""In fully decentralized DLT schemes, it is not clear who would define the relevant finality concepts under EU law (i.e. what constitutes a 'transfer order,' moment of entry, moment of settlement, law governing the 'system,' etc.),"" the paper continued.  The WFE also warned members of the potential risks of letting non-financial third parties to take the lead on DLT solution development.  ""The lack of formal oversight whilst DLT solutions are being developed, may result in negative consequences for investor protection and orderly markets,"" it concluded.  Last year, it was reported that 21 members surveyed by the WFE said they were actively exploring applications of DLT, and several indicated they had secured budgets for research and development in the field.

42400156,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIrKM,1500456622,CoinDash ICO Hacker Nets Additional Ether as Theft Tops $10 Million,"A few prospective investors were still sending ether to an ethereum address compromised in an initial coin offering (ICO) held by a startup called CoinDash yesterday, inadvertently bringing the total lost in the theft up to around $10m.  As reported on July 17, $7m was initially stolen by a hacker who altered the contract address of the ICO project. CoinDash said in an updated statement today that 2,000 investors have now sent a total of 37,000 ethers to the fake address after the open sale started.  While only a small number of transactions have been seen since the hack was revealed, one investor sent 50 ethers to the fake address, according to Etherscan.io.  At publication, around 43,500 ether had been sent to the address in total, bringing the value of the theft to just under $10.3m, amid the cryptocurrency market rebound over the last day.  While CoinDash has yet to disclose how the breach occurred, others are beginning to speculate on what caused the issue.  Wu Guanggeng, the COO of China's mining pool Bixin, for example, posited on Weibo that the breach may have actually been made via the domain name server provider. When reached out to by CoinDesk, Wu indicated his source for the information was a WeChat official account that publishes cryptocurrency news for subscribers.  One post from the social messaging account claimed that CoinDash support staff said the hacker first cloned an almost identical website to CoinDash.io, while using a fake contact address.  The imposter then contacted the CoinDash's DNS provider using the registered email to request a redirection of traffic to the false site. Wu suspected the CoinDash email account was also compromised.  While CoinDash has previously stated that investors who have been affected by the hack will receive ICO tokens as compensation, those who made transactions after the website was shut down will not be compensated.  CoinDash did not confirm the cut-off time for the website closure. However, the company tweeted on 10:39 a.m. EST, July 17, that the token sale was over and asked investors not to send ""any ETH to any address.""  This was followed by another Tweet on 12:47 p.m. that linked to its statement, and another soon after pointing to a form for those who had been affected.  So far the fake contract address has not made any outgoing transactions.

42400172,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIrX9,1500451223,London Stock Exchange Group is Using Blockchain to Record Unlisted Securities,"A subsidiary of the London Stock Exchange Group is using blockchain to help unlisted small businesses tap resources previously only available to larger, public companies.  Developed by London Stock Exchange subsidiary Borsa Italiana, the blockchain platform, built with IBM Blockchain, is being designed to digitize both securities ownership and the capital structure of small- to medium-sized businesses (SMEs).  Currently undergoing an initial test phase with a small group of Borsa Italiana clients, the platform, powered by Hyperledger Fabric 1.0, is expected to eventually simplify the issuance of shares, streamlining SME access to capital.  London Stock Exchange Group's head of commercial technology innovation, David Harris, explained how moving the entire record of a small business's capital structure to a blockchain could make it easier for corporate owners to gain the trust of future investors.  Harris told CoinDesk:  ""Once you offer this structure to allow the ownership to be registered on a blockchain, you're then opening up greater certainty as to the ownership structure, which adds to the transparency and certainty of what future investors in the company will be walking into.""  Currently limited to SMEs in Europe, the blockchain solution is designed to replace the paper trading certificates still in use by many private companies with smaller budgets.  At this initial phase, only the records themselves are being moved to a blockchain, meaning Harris doesn't expect the increased efficiency will result in more frequent trades and higher liquidity.  However, Harris said the current tests are just the first of what he imagines could lead to the simplification of the fundraising process itself.  ""As you build out this ecosystem, it does not take a giant leap to where future shareholders, future capital, future debt can be raised,"" said Harris.  Blockchain maturity  Still, today's news also marks the first major public blockchain development for the London Stock Exchange Groups since it became a founding member of the then-unnamed Hyperledger project in late 2015.  After making early contributions to the code that eventually became known as Hyperledger Fabric, the London Stock Exchange Group has been relatively quiet.  According to Harris, the group, which also includes the Turquoise stock exchange and the FTSE AIM Italia SME index, remained skeptical that blockchain was mature enough to meet the company's regulatory demands and transaction requirements.  In addition, Harris said there is also the difficulty of converting traditional assets and workflows into blockchain assets and smart contracts.  Then, with the release of Hyperledger Fabric 0.6 earlier this year, LSEG set up an internal working group that united its business, regulatory and legal teams as part of an effort ""to figure out the right places"" to apply the technology.  The final decision to focus on private small business shares puts the group in a similar category to Nasdaq, which unveiled its own private securities platform using Chain earlier this year.  ""With new companies, small- and medium-sized enterprises, who are not part yet of the public issuance process, they are a good starting point to introduce new types of models,"" said Harris.  Data weave  While the project began with Fabric 0.6, the version currently being tested was recently upgraded to the newly released production-ready Fabric 1.0, according to IBM’s vice president of blockchain solutions and research, Ramesh Gopinath.  Gopinath reported that even after the upgrade, what remained to be satisfied from a regulatory perspective was the security of the data being supplied throughout the ""lifecycle."" This included all the events a small company undergoes, from its entrance to the blockchain ecosystem, through to its possible exit as a publicly traded company.  By ""weaving"" data provided by the still-unnamed test firms together with corporate actions programmed into smart contracts, ""the right levels of trust in the data and the workflow itself"" can potentially be achieved, he said.  A time frame for when the results of the tests will be published was not revealed.  Harris concluded:  ""It's a technology that once it's widely adopted – and it has a long way to go – it is a disruptive innovation to its core, which is very exciting.""
