Bitcoin Netflows Say Around 20k BTC Flowed Out Of All Exchanges Yesterday As pointed out by a CryptoQuant post, netflows amounted to 20k BTC exiting exchanges yesterday, the largest spike since September. The &apos;all exchanges netflow&apos; is an on-chain indicator that measures the net amount of Bitcoin going into or out of wallets of all exchanges. The metric&apos;s value is calculated by simply taking the difference between the inflows and the outflows. When the indicator assumes positive values, it means the inflows are currently overwhelming the outflows, and a net amount of coins is entering exchange wallets. Investors usually send their crypto to exchanges for withdrawing to fiat or for purchasing altcoins. So, if such netflows persist, the outcome could be bearish for the price of BTC. On the other hand, negative netflows appear when more Bitcoin is entering exchanges than the amount going out. Prolonged downward spikes of the indicator can be bullish for the crypto as they may mean holders are in a state of accumulation.

42411602,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glP041,1640361754,10 2022 Predictions From PwC’s Henri Arslanian,"2021 was a historic year for crypto with many milestones. And there are no signs of the momentum slowing down in 2022!  As per our tradition since 2015, here are my 10 crypto predictions for the coming year:  Fortune 500 companies in the metaverse  2021 saw the concept of the metaverse burst into the mainstream. Although many metaverse games and ecosystems have been around for many years, from Second Life to Roblox, Facebook changing its name to Meta in late October brought this to the forefront. It put the spotlight on the growing metaverse ecosystem. The likes of Decentraland and The Sandbox are good examples, each of which has seen tremendous growth. Expect that to continue in 2022, with every Fortune 500 company trying to figure out its own metaverse strategy.  Twenty years ago, every business had to suddenly come up with its e-commerce or online strategy. Now, every Fortune 500 company will need to think about its metaverse strategy. Expect consulting firms (like ours) to be all over this.  2021 was the year the broader world “discovered” the metaverse. 2022 will be the year it may go mainstream.  Private banks have crypto FOMO  Last year, we predicted that 2021 would see many private banks enter the crypto market. And they did. 2021 saw many private banks, from Morgan Stanley to J.P. Morgan, launch bitcoin and crypto products for their customers.  Such products were a response to the demand for exposure to digital assets from many of the family offices and high-net-worth individuals. In addition, these products still offer high fees and high margins for private banks in an environment in which fee compression is becoming the norm.  Having such products are now seen as a competitive advantage for these private banks, and we will probably soon move to an era in which not having any crypto products will be a stark disadvantage.  Many large private banks disregarded bitcoin as not a serious asset (not having crypto-related products to sell probably did not help!). But we should expect most to do a 180 and introduce crypto offerings in 2022.  Read more: Pantera’s Paul Veradittakit’s 2022 Predictions  El Salvador inspires others?  2021 saw El Salvador become the first country in the world to recognize bitcoin as legal tender. The positive effects are already being recorded: According to El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele, more people there now have a bitcoin wallet than a bank account, allowing the 70% of the population that receives remittances to be able to do so without the excessive fees, which can balloon up to 12.5%.  Not surprisingly, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank – two organizations that were created during the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference in which the U.S. dollar was adopted as the global reserve currency – have been very opposed to such moves, publicly warning El Salvador to reverse course.  Many politicians or policymakers in other smaller countries, especially those that are dollarized or de facto dollarized like Panama, or those in the developing world like Paraguay, could follow El Salvador’s footsteps.  Others may not want bitcoin per se, but could be interested in other forms of digital currencies. For example, Palau announced that it is looking at launching a government-backed stablecoin, and the Marshall Islands is already looking at introducing its own digital currency. And this often goes beyond emerging markets. For example, a recent survey found that 27% of U.S. residents support making bitcoin legal tender.  Expect many other jurisdictions to monitor how things develop in El Salvador closely. They may not necessarily directly follow in El Salvador’s footsteps and recognize bitcoin as legal tender in 2022, but expect the topic to be actively discussed.  Make or break for Ethereum  Ethereum is the biggest smart contract and layer 1 platform by market cap. However, 2021 showed its legacy issues, from scalability struggles to exorbitant fees, with average transaction fees ranging from around $4 all the way to $70.  There is a lot of optimism surrounding Ethereum 2.0, which, coupled with recent changes like EIP-1559, has driven the price of ETH from $750 to $4,800 at its peak this year. Although Ethereum was the only serious show in town during the last major crypto bull market of 2017, there are now numerous layer 1 alternatives, from Algorand and Avalanche to Solana and Tezos, which not only provide better scalability but also come with significantly lower fees.  The crypto community is patient and has a lot of goodwill toward Ethereum. But unless the ETH 2.0 upgrade happens on schedule, the network risks losing many of its users, who could ultimately determine that the grass may be greener on some of the other blockchains.  Gamers catalyze Web 3  Web 1.0 was the static internet, represented by the likes of AOL and Netscape. Web 2.0 is an engaging internet, but controlled by the large tech players like Meta and Google. Web 3.0 is an internet that is decentralized and permissionless, but also one in which users have control of their data.  The convergence of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi) and the metaverse is leading us toward a Web 3 ecosystem. And the catalyst here may be the video game industry.  There are more than 2.5 billion gamers around the globe, and frustration has been mounting in recent years over the outsized control exercised by some of the large gaming companies, from the inability of these players to own their in-game assets to the lack of interoperability with other games.  2021 showed us the power of DeFi and NFTs in gaming, in addition to the power of decentralized play-to-earn models like Axie Infinity and its 2 million-plus monthly active players. With the numerous funds popping up that are exclusively focused in the sector, Solana’s $150 million Web 3.0 gaming fund being a perfect example, expect this market to catalyze.  NFTs mainstream, but lacking accounting, tax and legal clarity  2021 saw NFTs come under the spotlight, with the total sales volume surging past $12 billion. Several splashy, high-profile sales led the way, from Beeple’s $69 million jpeg to the numerous multimillion dollar sales of CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs.  The euphoria around NFTs (and the sky-high valuations) may fade, but the reality is that NFTs are here to stay. Expect them to become more mainstream and even invisible in day-to-day interactions.  We should expect to see NFTs featured in everything from limited edition sneakers and high-end purses to sports tickets and in-game collectibles as this medium becomes the standard rather than the exception.  The big question here now surrounds the legal, tax and accounting considerations around such NFTs, which are far from being clear. From a legal perspective, what are the considerations around intellectual property or consumer rights? From an accounting perspective, do NFTs represent an IP licensing right or an intangible asset? From a tax perspective, what are the considerations around revenue from the issuance of an NFT or the ongoing royalties?  A recent PricewaterhouseCoopers survey found that only 7% of tax authorities globally provide any form of tax guidance on NFTs. In 2022, that needs to change. Guidance will be beneficial not only to tax or regulatory authorities, but to the general public, as well.  All eyes on China and its e-CNY  2021 was a banner year for CBDCs. Not only did we see groundbreaking projects in the field of wholesale CBDCs, from Hong Kong’s Project mCBDC Bridge to Singapore’s Project Dunbar, we also saw numerous retail CBDCs take shape, from Nigeria’s eNaira to The Bahamas’ sand dollar.  But all eyes in 2022 will be on China with the upcoming launch of its e-CNY. The country has already processed around $9.7 billion in e-CNY transactions under its different pilot programs. More than 140 million Chinese residents already have their e-CNY wallet.  China’s latest cryptocurrency ban and the start of the Beijing Winter Olympics in February pave the way for the launch of the e-CNY early next year. This will be a historic moment in the world of money.  Centralized crypto exchanges DEX competition  As we predicted last year, DeFI continued its rapid growth in 2021, with total value locked growing from just shy of $22 billion at the end of 2020 to over $250 billion today.  DeFi is without a doubt one of the most exciting areas in finance today, with new offerings from decentralized exchanges and lending to asset management and even insurance offerings being improved on a daily basis.  Some of the features of DeFi, such as composability, give us an opportunity to reimagine financial services with a first principles approach, something that we have not had the opportunity to do in several decades.  And that is attracting not only record levels of assets but, most importantly, talent, with many bright minds laser focused on this market.  DeFi will affect not only traditional financer but also centralized exchanges, especially when trading on DEXs becomes more user friendly. Centralized platforms will continue to exist and play a big role, especially as a fiat on-ramp and for new entrants, but they will need to cohabit increasingly with DEXs.  The U.S. dominates bitcoin mining and helps ESG  Until July, around 65% of global bitcoin mining took place in China. Following the ban there, almost all of that activity moved to countries friendlier to bitcoin mining, such as Canada, Kazakhstan, Russia and the United States.  The United States has already become the biggest bitcoin miner on the globe, with its share of activity skyrocketing from 4% back in late 2019 to more than 35% following the ban in China. With some of the regulatory uncertainty in countries like Kazakhstan, we should expect the U.S. share of mining activity to continue to grow over the coming months.  The main advantage here is that bitcoin mining will become greener. About 57% of bitcoin mining globally today uses renewable sources of energy, according to the Bitcoin Mining Council, an industry group, with that percentage being higher in the United States. Bitcoin mining could ultimately accelerate the growth of such renewables, from being a buyer of last resort to making renewable energy production more sustainable. This could also help when it comes to addressing the looming environmental, social and governance (ESG) debate.  Many initially thought of the China ban as a negative development. It may end up as one of the biggest positive catalysts in our industry. Expect to see the positive consequences play out in 2022.  Crypto M&A turn crypto unicorns into octopuses  As we predicted last year, 2021 turned out to be a record year for crypto mergers and acquisitions. According to some data sources, 2021 crypto M&A amounted to over $25 billion in value.  We should expect this to continue in 2022, particularly with crypto unicorns increasingly transforming into crypto octopuses by spending some of their bull market gains and acquiring or investing in firms that offer ancillary services to their current offerings.  In particular, firms that offer access to retail communities, ecosystems, content or data, or some combination of those, should be interesting acquisition targets for some of these crypto platforms. Same goes for firms that are regulated in key markets, thus enabling access and faster go to market strategies.  We should also expect some of the larger financial services firms, especially those that were late to embark on their crypto journey, to look for potential acquisitions.  In 2022, the crypto M&A party will be far from over!",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,Henri Arslanian,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2021/12/24/10-2022-predictions-from-pwcs-henri-arslanian,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4e28040a072af1e17d01073b3c668c6ded197e4f-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42389902,89WXKWUN1T5QFoffyf6kVq,1640361572,Planning for Better Breed of DOGE: Dogecoin Foundation Lays Out First-Ever Road Map,"The Dogecoin Foundation, a nonprofit organization that aims to support the development of the meme coin through advocacy, has launched its first-ever road map detailing a number of new projects.  The foundation announced a dogecoin “trail map” that features eight projects, including the launch of LibDogecoin and GigaWallet.  This is the first such road map released by the foundation in its eight-year history.  In August, the foundation signed the Dogecoin Manifesto, which explained the goal of DOGE and allowed the fans of the Shiba Inu-inspired cryptocurrency to also sign the manifesto capturing feedback and what the community wanted from the project.  The Dogecoin Foundation, boasts some well-known board members and advisers, including Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.  In its road map, the foundation said it is working with Buterin on “crafting a uniquely Doge proposal for a ‘community staking’ version of proof-of-stake (PoS) that will allow everyone, not just the big players to participate in a way that rewards them for their contribution to running the network.”  The foundation goes on to say it has “some influential friends” on its side and a growing group of people who are getting ready to contribute development time to these open-source projects.  In February, Elon Musk suggested in a tweet that dogecoin might be “the future currency of earth.” Musk’s involvement in the DOGE token tribe has helped send the cryptocurrency “mooooning” (his word), along with other alternative cryptocurrencies.  DOGE started as a joke in 2013, and is now the 12th most valuable cryptocurrency by market value, according to CoinMarketCap.  In July, dogecoin founder Jackson Palmer said that he would not be returning to cryptocurrency as it is “is an inherently right-wing, hyper-capitalistic technology built primarily to amplify the wealth of its proponents through a combination of tax avoidance, diminished regulatory oversight and artificially enforced scarcity.”  On Friday, DOGE was trading at $0.186232, up more than 5% over the last 24 hours.

42389919,89WXKWUN1T5QFoffyf6knV,1640350714,"Cardano, Polkadot Advance as Crypto Market Rallies Ahead of Christmas","A “Santa rally” ahead of Christmas gripped crypto markets on Friday with most large-cap coins showing gains over 24 hours.  Bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and binance coin (BNB), three of the largest cryptocurrencies by market value, added almost 4%, setting the theme for a larger move among alternative currencies, or altcoins.  Liquidity across exchanges for bitcoin fell to under $8 billion on Thursday, as reported. The trend mirrors a historic theme across markets ahead of the holiday season: Trading volumes drop and volatility is enhanced, leading to extreme prices movements in either direction.  The rally in crypto markets from Thursday to Friday morning was led by LUNA, the native token of decentralized payments network Terra, which jumped to over $100 in Asian hours on Friday.  Cardano’s ADA and Polkadot’s DOT tokens were other big movers, adding more than 7% each. Both protocols are positioned as Ethereum rivals and saw major upgrades this year. Smart contracts went live on Cardano in November, opening it up for DeFi applications going forward, while parachains went live on Polkadot earlier this month, allowing for the creation of other blockchains atop the Polkadot network.  Tokens of Near (NEAR), a high-speed blockchain, gained 8% to a new high of $14. NEAR traded under $8 earlier this week, and surged after an integration with Terra for its UST stablecoins. UST is pegged 1:1 with U.S. dollars and is currently the largest decentralized stablecoin, with a market capitalization of $9.6 billion.  Among memecoins, in the past 24 hours dogecoin added 3.4% while shiba inu (SHIB) gained 8% to continue their advance from Monday. SHIB prices briefly reached $0.0004 in early Asian hours on Friday morning before dropping back. Prices of the memecoin jumped earlier this week as a single entity purchased over $136 million worth of SHIB on Wednesday, as reported.  Tokens of The Sandbox (SAND) led gains among metaverse projects with a 22% surge in the past 24 hours. The move came as consulting firm PwC Hong Kong said it purchased digital land in The Sandbox metaverse, marking the first-such step by a major company.  Other metaverse projects were more restrained. Axie Infinity (AXS) and Gala (GALA) gained 6.7% each in the past 24 hours, moving with the rest of the market. Decentraland (MANA) posted nearly double those moves, with a 15% spike.  RSI turns overbought on bitcoin  Bitcoin crossed the $50,000 resistance level on Thursday night to over $51,300 on Friday morning. Such prices were last seen in the first week of December, a level from which bitcoin has slid to support of $46,000 on three occasions.  Relative Strength Index (RSI) readings for bitcoin show the asset has reached “overbought” conditions. RSI calculates market momentum for assets, and an overbought level implies prices are overvalued and may be primed for a trend reversal or corrective price pullback.  Such RSI levels were previously seen early November when, bitcoin traded at its previous high around $67,000. Prices fell to under $59,000 the following week. However, Friday’s reading doesn’t necessarily mean a price drop will occur, as asset prices are dependent on several market dynamics.  The upward move for bitcoin caused north of $100 million in liquidations on bitcoin futures, data from analytics tool Coinglass showed. A full $84 million of that amount occurred on short positions, or from traders betting against rising prices. Futures are financial products that allow traders to track the prices of underlying assets without holding that asset.  Futures for ether saw over $32 million in liquidations, while traders of LUNA and SAND took hits of $8 million.  The single-largest liquidation occurred on crypto exchange Bitfinex as of European hours on Friday – a dogecoin trade to the tune of $5 million.",POSITIVE,ADA | BTC | DOT,ADA | BTC | DOT | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/24/cardano-polkadot-advance-as-crypto-market-rallies-ahead-of-christmas,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7e0c432a6e36976df7f19a4d9a9dd73cd1a5c42a-1813x830.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

After LUNA’s 10% decline to $85 on Thursday, the token went back to its previous high of $96 in early trading hours in Asia. Then an announcement by crypto exchange Binance that it will list UST, a stablecoin issued on the Terra network, pushed LUNA above $100. The price met resistance at that level and was down 5 cents at press time.  Rising prices caused the total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols on Terra to cross the $21 billion mark, data from analytics tool DeFi Llama showed, making it the largest DeFi network after Ethereum. The figure has grown by almost $3 billion from Wednesday’s $18 billion level.  Of the total, over $9 billion is locked on Anchor, a stablecoin-based yield-generating application. For TerraSwap, a decentralized exchange built with Terra smart contracts, TVL jumped 81% to over $2 billion from last week.  DeFi protocols rely on smart contracts instead of middlemen to provide financial services such as lending, borrowing and trading.  The value is split among 13 protocols, or over $1.6 billion per protocol on average. That compares with $73 million per protocol on Binance Smart Chain, the third-largest DeFi network, which has $17 billion locked on 232 protocols.  Some say applications like Anchor add to Terra’s allure for investors.  “A 20% APY (annual percentage yield) on UST deposits through the Anchor Protocol is very appealing because capital flows from price-volatile assets to more risk-averse yield-bearing positions,” Marvin Steinberg, founder of investment firm Steinberg Invest, said in a Telegram message with CoinDesk.  LUNA’s price increase is part of a broader multimonth rally, one buoyed by November′s changes to its token mechanisms – such as a ”burn” feature that periodically decreases supply – and increased activity on DeFi applications built on Terra.

Internet Computer is a blockchain built by the Dfinity Foundation to help facilitate a decentralized layer of web infrastructure. It is backed by prominent funds such as a16z and Polychain Capital.  Called Terabethia, the bridge enables cross-chain contract communication, asset mirroring and transfers across different blockchains. It is built on a forked version of Ethereum scaling tool StarkWare, and will enable contracts on both blockchains to communicate and allow anyone to mirror and use any Ethereum asset on the Internet Computer and vice versa.  Bridges allow blockchains to exchange data, tokens or smart contract instructions with each other. These operate independently of the rules or consensus mechanisms of whichever blockchains they connect.  “Similarly to how Ethereum extended the functionality, usefulness and value of Bitcoin, we believe the Internet Computer has the potential to do the same for Ethereum assets and applications, and could even potentially become the best L2 (layer 2) for Ethereum long term,” explained Harrison Hines, founder of Psychedelic, the Web 3 development studio behind Terabethia.  What the bridge does  The bridge comes ahead of Internet Computer’s native Ethereum integration, which will allow interoperability between the two blockchains. The integration will allow Internet Computer smart contracts to hold Ethereum assets on Ethereum and make calls to them, but won’t allow ERC-20 assets to directly exist. A bridge helps solve that problem.  Porting assets between the Internet Computer and Ethereum can help create liquidity and complementary products for the user base of the two blockchains, such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or other decentralized finance (DeFi) products.  DeFi protocols rely on smart contracts instead of third parties to provide financial services, such as lending, borrowing and trading, to users.  Internet Computer started this year with a “reverse gas model” to focus on scalability. The model sees developers supply the funds needed to run the applications/contracts that use their gas – a fee paid to use a blockchain, Internet Computer in this case.  But the response among investors has been weak. Tokens of Internet Computer (ICP) fell 97% since their issuance in May – from $700 to Friday morning’s $21 – amid reports of alleged insider trading and large token holders exiting their positions. The tokens have a market capitalization of $5 billion as of Friday, down 72% from May′s $18 billion figure.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/12/24/dfinitys-internet-computer-opens-ethereum-bridge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9a1e6246bbbf3107900dfe9d0de21e29fe89bb68-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
