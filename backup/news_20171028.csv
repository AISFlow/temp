42400576,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcK4Ux,1509204538,Where to Trade Bitcoin? Brokerage Apps Move In Amid Market Boom,"Established brokers and startups want in on the crypto boom – but, Trading 212 is a bit of both.  Founded by Bulgarians Ivan Ashminov and Boris Nedialkov, Trading 212 is the trade name for Avus Capital, a broker-dealer with roots going back 14 years in foreign exchange and commodities dealing in Europe. But while the company isn't exactly new, what it's doing with share trading and cryptocurrencies is – and it seems to be generating success so far.  Its app is the most-downloaded trading app in the UK, with the company now providing a full-blown trading operation, with markets in some 2,500 instruments, ranging from shares to commodities.  In June this year, however, Trading 212 took a bold step in adding cryptocurrencies to the mix, helping it to attract a younger crowd – the millennials – broking industry incumbents are finding hard to reach. These are the consumers who grew up against the background of the 2008 financial crisis, and as a consequence, are inclined to see financial service companies as the bad guys.  And while U.S. fintech startups Invstr and Kapitall are targeting the same demographic of 20-something financial cynics, they don't yet have the ""magic sauce"" of crypto to sell on their shelves. For the likes of Trading 212, crypto is a way of further enhancing its appeal to new users.  But the question is: just how effective has this push been?  No hard figures  Nick Saunders, chief executive of Trading 212's UK operation, won't say for sure.  In interview, Saunders was cagey about disclosing exact figures on how much crypto constitutes in terms of its overall business, although he described the contribution as ""significant.""  ""We'd rather not share the exact numbers but it is [a few percent] of the combined volume generated by all exchanges, which is quite a lot for a single retail broker,"" he said.  Still, Saunders did suggest that Trading 212 is benefiting from the wave of new attention cryptocurrencies have received in 2017. After rising from under $10 billion at the start of the year, the total value of the combined market has risen to more than $170 billion.  In short, it's showing all the attributes of a hot market that's generating returns.  Saunders continued:  ""Clients numbers are always driven by volatility and the news. When the two combine and bitcoin price rises make headline news, this drives new clients to open accounts.""  Options and options  It doesn't hurt that Trading 212's app, honed for more mainstream tastes, is slick.  The app includes a real-time chat facility in a link-up with TradeBird – a trading-focused social network set-up by Trading 212's founders; accessible educational tools and regular cryptocurrencies analysis, which has all helped it to attract a growing audience.  Even before it offered crypto, Trading 212 caught imaginations when it came up with a freemium model for share trading, in which customers get commission-free dealing for up to 10 trades a month, up to a maximum value of £10,000 per trade.  The company estimates that 90% of its equity customers will pay nothing at all, with the 10% of high-rolling ""whales"" delivering its revenue stream.  Perhaps propelling its growth among more seasoned cryptocurrency traders, though, is that it has also added a swath of available options from the asset class. Customers can deal not just in bitcoin and ether, the two largest cryptos by market cap, but in ripple, bitcoin cash, dash, monero and neo.  Saunders revealed to CoinDesk that Trading 212 plans to add a further 14 currencies in November – ethereum classic, zcash, qtum, omisego, iota, eos, lisk, augur, cardano, waves, stratis, ark, steem and stratis.  Making markets  Apart from that, Saunders is pledging the app can ""remove all the complexity and risk"" of owning cryptocurrencies, which today often involves storing or managing a set of cryptographic keys (or trusting someone else to do so), by using contract for differences (CFDs).  A type of financial instrument made to mirror an underlying asset, the use of the tool means that trading crypto on the platform does not involve buying the claims to those keys, as you would on a crypto exchange such as Bitfinex, the marker leader by volume.  But, CFDs have a downside, too, in that trading isn't yet available in the U.S.  CDFs involve trading on margin, which has the effect of magnifying gains but also losses and is why the SEC has taken it upon itself to protect traders by banning CFDs.  Still, Trading 212 has made other tweaks to its service to accommodate cryptocurrencies.  For one, it has a Bitcoin Mini market that quotes a price one-tenth the value of bitcoin, which they believe makes opening a position much more manageable and possibly less scary. (Saunders says the average deal size for bitcoin is around £10,000.)  As with fiat currency or share trading, stop losses can also be set so you get to sleep at night without worrying if the South Koreans are about to start selling bitcoin big time.  Trading 212's killer feature, though, is perhaps the fact that on its crypto markets you can ""sell"" coins as well as buy. This provides novice and experienced users alike with a way to “short” the market if they think prices are going to fall. As ever with trading, it’s all about the timing.  Bigger wave  Elsewhere, other CFD, spread betting and forex brokers have been getting in on the action.  Avatrade.com and Trade.com are two forex brokers trying their hand at crypto. Another is InterTrader, which provides dealing in bitcoin and ether, and is currently giving away 1 ether to anyone opening a new account and trading a stake worth a minimum of €500.  And then there’s UK spread-betting behemoth IG Group, which was the first to offer CFD and spread-betting bitcoin products. Shai Heffetz, managing director at InterTrader is a long-time bitcoin believer, stating: ""There is no doubt virtual currencies are going to play a significant role in the future of the economy.""  A new kid on the block is a trading app from startup Bux, positioning itself as a ""millennial financial brand,"" is trying to make headway by turning stock investing into a game with virtual trading, hoping to convert its young customer base to funding their accounts with real money.  Of its 200,000 UK users, Bux claims 85,000 are now using real money. Its app, with a design look-and-feel that evokes the Grand Theft Auto video game, and judging from the stream showing what app users are trading, bitcoin is one of the more popular trades among its client base.  Still, the likes of Coinbase notwithstanding, buying and securing your crypto is not seen as a straightforward matter by most ordinary folk.  Yet, as interest in crypto grows, the new breed of trading apps from Trading 212 (and others) show there's a big market for more familiar ways to gain exposure.

42400571,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcK4S0,1509195655,Desperately Seeking Devs: How to Fill Bitcoin's Talent Shortage,"Jimmy Song is a bitcoin developer, an instructor for Dev++ and runs his own in-depth technical bitcoin seminar called Programming Blockchain.  In this opinion piece, he explains why there's a shortage of devs in the bitcoin community, why that's a problem and how the industry is addressing it.      For all the explosive growth in the bitcoin community the last few years – in users, transactions, companies, open-source projects, press coverage, cultural references and of course the price – there remains an obvious deficit that's both pronounced and difficult to fill.  Simply put, there aren't enough developers.  There are many reasons for the talent shortage, chief among them the insatiable demand.  Just about every company that deals with bitcoin cannot recruit anywhere near the number of developers they need. These companies have considerable revenue and customer growth and would love to expand as soon as possible, but the main constraint is that they can't find enough qualified people to develop. Many who had local-only policies have relaxed those requirements and now allow full-time remote bitcoin developers. One prominent company president regards finding a local blockchain expert akin to finding a unicorn these days.  Another contributing factor is the price rise. While the appreciation has been good for everyone who held on during the bear market, it's bad for a lot of bitcoin companies as they find that many developers simply don't need to work due to the gains on their bitcoin holdings. Many developers would rather start their own companies, contribute to open-source projects or focus on investing instead of working for someone else. In a way, bitcoin companies are victims of their own success.  The talent deficit in the ecosystem is getting so severe that many companies are offering enormous bonuses to find developers and still can't fill the positions. Most would love to hire 15 to 20 developers if possible, but they simply don't get enough qualified people.  Another contributing factor is the higher level of rigor required to program blockchain applications. Messing up a website may take a site down for a few minutes, but messing up a bitcoin transaction may lead to loss of money, which requires a lot more rigor. The thoroughness required from developers is rare.  The industry is not sitting still. There are a variety of initiatives to fill this developer deficit. Chief among them is Dev++, which is led by the Bitcoin Edge Initiative, a nonprofit initiative focused on addressing this gap. This year at Scaling Bitcoin, in addition to a well-respected conference, Dev++ will train up to 100 developers to become more familiar with blockchain concepts. Bitcoin Edge hopes to heavily subsidize this in-person 2-day training with sponsorships from many of the very bitcoin companies that feel the developer deficit most acutely.  Devs: Learn and become a part of this exploding industry. Help make bitcoin better.

42400583,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcK4Zs,1509149574,Worse Than Tulip Mania? Common Misconceptions About Crypto Assets,"Chris Burniskeis a cofounder of Placeholder Ventures in New York and former blockchain products lead at ARK Investment Management LLC. Jack Tatar is an angel investor and advisor to startups.  In this opinion piece, adapted from their book Cryptoassets: The Innovative Investor’s Guide to Bitcoin and Beyond, they explain what mainstream financial commentators still don't understand about the space – even if the markets are starting to get it.      This has been a breakout year for crypto assets, but not so long ago we were thickly in ""blockchain, not bitcoin"" season.  When we began work on our book, the consensus play seemed to be stripping the native assets out of blockchains and privatizing these originally open networks.  With the book, we set out to make a stand for public blockchains as the more important innovation, to confront the misguided (and persistent) claim that crypto assets are elaborate scams, and to reassure macroeconomists that not all crypto assets are currencies.  Bitcoin, not blockchain  One of the main motivations for writing the book was to emphasize the value of the native assets that incentivize a distributed set of actors to provision a digital good or service with no central operator, i.e. crypto assets.  Given the recent boom in interest around crypto assets, it seems counterintuitive that much of 2014, 2015 and 2016 were dominated by the idea that blockchain technology was important, while crypto assets could be forgotten and little would be lost.  The term distributed ledger technology (DLT) became popularized to convey this concept, effectively washing those pursuing DLT-strategies clean of association with bitcoin. Many in the financial services industry were all too eager to forget that bitcoin was the mother of blockchain technology.  Fall 2015 was when the frenzy around private blockchains really began, with Blythe Masters and Digital Asset Holdings featured on the cover of Bloomberg Magazine, and the Economist running a front cover piece called ""The Trust Machine.""  The combination of Masters, Bloomberg, and the Economist led to a spike in interest in blockchain technology that set off a sustained climb in global Google search volumes for ""blockchain."" In the two weeks between Oct. 18 and Nov. 1, 2015, just after Bloomberg and the Economist published their articles, global Google search volumes for 'blockchain' grew 70 percent.  We find ourselves on the flip side of Jamie Dimon’s reasoning: we believe the majority of private blockchains and DLT implementations will become the CompuServes and AOLs of the cryptoasset movement.  Time and again through the history of information technology, open has won out over closed, public has won out over private. This is not to say there isn’t a place for closed and private, but rather that the impact such systems have on the world consistently pales in comparison to the change brought about by open and public systems.  As we write in the book,  ""We see many DLT solutions as band-aids to the coming disruption. While DLT will help streamline existing processes — which will help profit margins in the short term — for the most part these solutions operate within what will become increasingly outdated business models.""  Baby boomer biases  Famously, Nout Wellink, former president of the Dutch Central Bank, said of bitcoin, ""This is worse than the tulip mania…At least then you got a tulip [at the end], now you get nothing.""  Nout displays a type of anti-crypto asset bias many baby boomers suffer from: if these things have no physical form, how could they possibly have value?  To start, such a mindset then raises the same question of much of our world, which is increasingly based upon things that have only digital representations and amass massive amounts of value.  For example, the market caps of Twitter, Facebook and Google are largely based on 100% digital services—certainly, those services produce cash flows, but cash is paid in exchange for a digital service, implying a purely digital service can have value. To sate the skeptical, in our book we provide a deep dive into methodologies for valuing bitcoin, and explain how the methodologies can be put to use for crypto assets more broadly.  One of our favorite explorations was working to quantify the contributions of developers, which we don’t think we nailed, but hopefully provided a basis for future work and exploration. Below is one of the developer graphs, showing the frequency of activity based on code repository points and the number of days a crypto asset project has been in the works.  In addition to explaining how crypto assets have a very real form of value, we spend two chapters exploring the most famous market disasters across all kinds of asset classes, including John Law and the Mississippi Company that brought France to its knees, the cornering of the gold market by Jay Gould, and different forms of this time is different thinking.  We spend a significant chunk of time exploring the history of financial speculation to highlight that all asset classes go through growing pains, and we should expect the same of crypto assets.  We may have new bad actors in the crypto markets, but they are playing old tricks.  Why so many?  A question asked by many new to the industry is, why do we need more than 1,000 currencies? Can’t we do with just a handful? And if these things intend to be currencies, why are they so volatile?  For that reason, we titled the book Cryptoassets, and not Cryptocurrencies, and we explain our thinking as follows:  Historically, crypto assets have most commonly been referred to as cryptocurrencies, which we think confuses new users and constrains the conversation on the future of these assets. We would not classify the majority of crypto assets as currencies, but rather most are either digital commodities (crypto commodities), provisioning raw digital resources, or digital tokens (crypto tokens), provisioning finished digital goods and services.  A currency fulfills three well-defined purposes: to serve as a means of exchange, store of value, and unit of account. However, the form of currency itself often has little inherent value. For example, the paper bills in people’s wallets have about as little value as the paper in their printer. Instead, they have the illusion of value, which if shared widely enough by society and endorsed by the government, allows these monetary bills to be used to buy goods and services, to store value for later purchases, and to serve as a metric to price the value of other things.  Meanwhile, commodities are wide-ranging and most commonly thought of as raw material building blocks that serve as inputs into finished products. For example, oil, wheat, and copper are all common commodities. However, to assume that a commodity must be physical ignores the overarching “offline to online” transition occurring in every sector of the economy.  In an increasingly digital world, it only makes sense that we have digital commodities, such as compute power, storage capacity, and network bandwidth. While compute, storage and bandwidth are not yet widely referred to as commodities, they are building blocks that are arguably just as important as our physical commodities, and when provisioned via a blockchain network, they are most clearly defined as crypto commodities.  Beyond cryptocurrencies and crypto commodities — and also provisioned via blockchain networks—are “finished-product” digital goods and services like media, social networks, games, and more, which are orchestrated by crypto tokens. Just as in the physical world, where currencies and commodities fuel an economy to create finished goods and services, so too in the digital world the infrastructures provided by cryptocurrencies and crypto commodities are coming together to support the aforementioned finished-product digital goods and services.  Crypto tokens are in the earliest stage of development, and will likely be the last to gain traction as they require a robust cryptocurrency and crypto commodity infrastructure to be built before they can reliably function.  The markets catch up  We wrote Cryptoassets to cut against the grain of thinking that claimed bitcoin and its digital siblings were a niche movement, and instead to emphasize to investors that this represents the greatest opportunity for investors and entrepreneurs since the Web.  In the midst of writing, the markets came to the same realization, taking the aggregate network value of crypto assets up roughly 15-fold, and doing much of the convincing for us.  Nonetheless, we hope the book serves as a useful guide to the uninitiated, an explainer for befuddled financial professionals, and a reflection on the wild ride it’s been for the crypto OGs.
