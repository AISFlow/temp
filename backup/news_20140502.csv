42425612,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIebTh,1399071293,Money Spinners: New Bitcoin ATM Varieties Appearing,"From full exchange machines to one-way dispensers, CoinDesk brings you the latest in bitcoin automated service news from around the world.  The past week saw some new brands arriving on the scene, in another sign the bitcoin ATM space is beginning to diversify beyond just a few manufacturers.  The ATMs, also known as kiosks or vending machines depending on the jurisdiction, are not only putting more bitcoins into more wallets and eliminating some of the hassle of verifying accounts at online exchanges, but are also serving a secondary function as electronic ambassadors, educating the public about digital currencies and sparking curiosity simply by sitting there.  Seattle, WA  Seattle's first bitcoin machine is one of the more 'traditional' types: A Robocoin operated by CoinMe at the Spitfire Grill restaurant. The machine's palm scanner is operational as a customer-identifying measure and it has a limit of $3,000 in exchanges per user per day.  CoinMe's General Manager, Nick Hughes, said his aim is also to use the Robocoin to educate and inform, telling Geekwire:  ""People need to be able to talk about this and be educated about it [...] They need to hear about the risk and rewards from credible people.""  Saskatoon, SK Canada  Edmonton-based company Bitcoin Solutions also has the motto 'buy, sell, learn' and will install Saskatchewan's first machine this coming week at a location on Saskatoon's Broadway Ave. Not only is the 'BTM' one of the newer varieties but it's also home-grown, produced by Ottawa manufacturer BitAccess.  According to this news report, the city was chosen due to its large population of younger people.    EdandEthan oh ya!! pic.twitter.com/2jivb8uKTp      – Bitcoin Solutions (@EDMbtcsolutions) 3rd May 2014    BitAccess' co-founder Haseeb Awan said its units are compliant with FinCEN and FinTRAC guidelines and offer three layers of KYC depending on the transaction volume. Transactions below $3,000 require verification via a code sent to a telephone number, while transactions over $3,000 require ID and those over $10,000 must be reported to FinCEN or FinTRAC.  The company has also demonstrated its machines in the Canadian Senate and manufactures them in its clients' local markets. It currently has customers in eight countries and is expanding.  Bitcoin Solutions has previously opened another machine in Edmonton and is looking to expand to other Canadian cities in the near future.  Japan  For a country that teems with gadgets, geeks and bankers, Japan has been a little slow to jump on the bitcoin ATM bandwagon. It could be the lack of regulatory clarity and Japanese language software on the current range of popular ATMs, but that is changing.  Reports from the Wall Street Journal and TV Tokyo (video has since been removed) show Japan's first Robocoin, which is on a promotional tour. While it accepts Japanese yen, the main interface is still in English. There has been some progress on the regulatory front, however, with authorities taking a similar approach to that of Singapore: Bitcoin is not regarded as 'money' and thus will not be regulated, leading to a more hands-off approach.  When asked how many Robocoin machines his company intended to ship to Japan, CEO Jordan Kelley replied: ""As many as the Japanese market can bear.""  Amsterdam, Netherlands  Amsterdam now also has its own bitoin kiosk and once again, it's a newer variety. The manufacturer this time is BTC-O-Matic, a company that produces a range of different one and two-way bitcoin-dispensing devices. The one that began operating on 30th April is the 'DualFly' model, and a sample of the company's other products is in this video. It is located three minutes away from Amsterdam's Centraal district.  Dubai, UAE  Dubai startup Umbrellab is reportedly going ahead with plans to introduce over 300 bitcoin machines, by adding the feature to existing payment kiosks. This strategy led to some initial confusion over whether the machines were indeed bitcoin kiosks, but Umbrellab says it is able to do so.  The first demonstration model is in an office in the Dubai Media City technology zone, with hundreds more to follow shortly.  According to this report in the United Arab Emirates' largest newspaper, the Middle East could be fertile ground for a technology like bitcoin due to its large young population, and high number of foreign workers who often don't have full access to traditional banking services.

42425629,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIec1h,1399068360,"All Things Alt: Ponzi Schemes, Blackcoin USBs and a Time Warp Attack","With another week gone by, let's shine the spotlight on recent developments and interesting finds in the world of alternative digital currencies.  Shibes scheme in new online game  The popular meme-based digital currency dogecoin has been credited by some as providing a friendly introduction to digital currencies. However, now it is being leveraged to welcome people into a not-so-friendly corner of finance: the ponzi scheme.  PonziDoge  is billed as a “virtual experiment game” designed to educate people about the nature of ponzi schemes, a form of financial fraud that involves collecting investment funds for fake ventures.  The developers comment on the game’s website that PonziDoge is part of a broader experiment to test transaction settlement technologies. After suggesting that ""we assume no responsibility or give any guarantees"", the team adds that PonziDoge is not actually a ponzi scheme.  The site reads:  ""Obviously, if it was a real ponzi we would not call it that, since the whole point of a ponzi is to trick investors into believing their investment is legitimate! This game displays [the] ponzi dynamic and all players are willing and knowing participants.""  Whitecoin suffers variant of 51% attack  It appears that in the early hours of 30th April, a coordinated double-spend attack was launched against the whitecoin network. The incident affected digital currency exchanges and mining pools, and has sparked questions regarding the future of the altcoin.  A statement published on 1st May by whitecoin community member and developer Mogonzo detailed the attack.  According to Mogonzo, the event took place in two stages.  The first part of the attack involved a dedicated denial-of-service (DDOS) attack against the mining pool Chunkypools. This enabled the perpetrators to assume control of the network and gain control of the block chain.  A time warp attack was then launched against several exchanges. This is a variation on the 51% attack, which involves artificially lowering the block difficulty in order to generate coins quickly.  The attackers used the time warp attack to generate multiple blocks of whitecoins that were then sent to exchanges and sold. Cryptsy, MintPal and Bittrex were among the exchanges affected by the attack.  In the statement, Mogonzo advised whitecoin users to avoid use of the existing wallet infrastructure:  “We continue to discourage wallet use at this time until our update is provided. It’s taken us some time to develop a full understanding of what happened, as well as develop a solution.""  At press time, representatives from the exchanges were reportedly meeting with members of the Whitecoin Foundation, the coin’s community organisation, on coordinating deployment of the new wallets.  Blackcoin community launches new technology  A member of the blackcoin community has developed a piece of technology that offers a new level of functionality and convenience for personal users that is unique among altcoins.  The BlackCoin Card, also known as the Cryptocurrency Express (CEX) Card, is a multi-gigabyte USB wafer that comes pre-loaded with a wallet and specialized software. Once the USB is plugged into a computer and connected to the network, it automatically updates balances and loads the most recent blocks from blackcoin block chain.  Using a software trigger similar to CD-ROMS, the BlackCoin Card launches automatically upon system startup and brings up a user interface that includes wallet access, price indices and social media content published by the BlackCoin community.  It should be noted that the BlackCoin Card is not a payment card. The developer told CoinDesk that it’s meant to act as an easy-to-use introduction to the concept, as well as a simple means for distributing blackcoins.  The developer said:  ""This is the first time the end-user can get started with crypto in just a few minutes without having to search the web for solutions.""  The BlackCoin Card is now available and may be purchased with dollars and BTC, as well as LTC, DOGE and BC.  Strange alt of the week  Facebookcoin (sign: FBC) is an unusually brazen entry into the pantheon of alternative digital currencies for its potential violation of copyright law in both its title and logo.  As detailed on the Bitcoin Talk forum, facebookcoin is a variant of the “airdrop coin” in which a premined amount of coins is distributed among a given population.  According to the coin’s development team, only 5,040 facebookcoins are being mined prior to public launch.  Registered Facebook users who belong to the coin’s social channels are eligible to receive facebookcoins. Additionally, those who pay into an initial public offering (IPO) can also receive facebookcoins in exchange for bitcoins.  CoinDesk reached out to Facebook for comment, but has not received word from the social media company.  Have a tip about a notable happening in the altcoin world?

42425627,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIebxh,1399064144,"CloudHashing, HighBitcoin Merge Hosted Mining with ASICs to Form PeerNova","Two companies involved in the digital currency mining space are joining forces, melding hardware expertise with consumer mining services.  CloudHashing  , which offers cloud mining contracts, is merging with enterprise ASIC hardware designer HighBitcoin to form a new entity called PeerNova.  The combined company is planning to sell mining infrastructure services at an enterprise level under the PeerNova name, while CloudHashing will continue as a brand selling mining contracts, effectively allowing CloudHashing to take advantage of HighBitcoin's expertise with ASIC hardware design for its consumer mining services.  Further, it enables the combined company to offer distributed consumer applications in the future, leveraging the power of bitcoin's block chain.  PeerNova will also be bringing on Atiq Raza, formerly President & COO of AMD, as chairman.  In a prepared statement, Raza said:  ""This merger marries the best of breed in the bitcoin space and technology veterans from Silicon Valley. We will be building a suite of software applications and technology platforms to address this rapidly growing market.""  Proprietary hardware  CloudHashing CEO Emmanuel Abiodun recently told CoinDesk that the company had been hardware agnostic, ordering its mining equipment from all of the top manufacturers in the industry for its cloud mining service.  Abiodun now says that CloudHashing, under the PeerNova umbrella, will use HighBitcoin's ASIC technology exclusively.  Abiodum said:  ""We are one company now, PeerNova. We will be using our own hardware going forward.""  HighBitcoin has been focused on a high-level architecture built for datacenter efficiency.  Consumer vs enterprise  The combined company will have two distinct divisions, according to Abiodun, who will become president of the merged organization, with HighBitcoin's Naveed Sherwani serving as CEO.  CloudHashing will remain focused on allowing the average person to gain access to bitcoin mining via contracts. The company currently operates one of the top 10 pools on the Bitcoin network, and has almost 3.95PH/s of power according to its website.  PeerNova will take on HighBitcoin's previous role of providing enterprise-grade mining products and services.  Abiodun told CoinDesk that this includes designing and manufacturing ASIC hardware. It is currently selling racks to enterprise-level mines with a minimum of 20 40TH/s machines per order.  Regulation  The news follows a new ruling by FinCEN that has resulted in increased clarity for the cloud mining industry.  On 29 April, the anti-money laundering unit of the US Treasury released a letter informing companies that cloud mining should be considered a rental of computing hardware, not a money transmitter service. This paves the way for mining-as-a-service companies such as CloudHashing to operate without the need for pricey money transmitter licenses.  Sherwani said that PeerNova will also be looking at distributed applications as new lines of business as well.  He concluded:  ""Disruptive technologies [that have] widespread applications in digital currency transactions, remittances, smart contracts, digital coupons, loyalty programs and others”  Disclaimer: This article should not be viewed as an endorsement of any of the companies mentioned.

42425620,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIeblh,1399062333,BitPay Announces Plan to Display BTC Prices in Bits,"Weighing in on a topic that has recently risen to prominence in the bitcoin community, Georgia-based merchant processor BitPay has announced a plan for prices to be expressed in 'bits' on both its website and for customers.  The argument recently gained widespread exposure on reddit, with many supporters of the transition arguing that bitcoin's current divisions - mBTC, μBTC and cBTC - are too complex for mainstream consumers.  Noted bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik, who authored the post, indicated that BitPay decided to voice its potential support the change as it was an important ""human interface"" issue that warranted consideration by the industry.  Garzik explained just one issue the transition will solve, writing:  ""Many popular accounting and finance packages have problems when prices extend beyond two decimal places. The move to micro-bitcoins ensures, both now and in the future, wider compatibility.""  The company's Bitcoin Core Developer went on to explain why other alternative denominations are less attractive given the mass-market goals of bitcoin.  He confirmed to CoinDesk that BitPay would proceed with the plan, ""assuming positive feedback"" from the community.  Making prices more intuitive  Garzik indicated that BitPay's proposal is to move to six decimal places, up from four, drop the zero at the beginning of prices and add, at most, two decimal places to prices.  Garzik wrote:    ""At a higher level, people are more familiar with prices expressed in numbers extending no more than two decimal places.      This assumption is built into cash registers, spreadsheets, amount input dialogs and basic, person-person real-world transactions.""    As an example, Garzik indicated that paying 9,123 bits would be more intuitive for consumers than spending 0.009123 BTC.  Alternative options  Garzik also discussed why the company may not move to milli-bitcoins (mBTC), reasoning that it is a less attractive long-term option given that a transition to micro-bitcoins may be needed.  He concluded:  ""Best to make the change once, now, while bitcoin is young.""  For more on the current debate over how to break down bitcoin, read our full analysis.

42425615,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIebXh,1399059940,Andreas Antonopoulos Proposes Campaign to Highlight Yelp's Bitcoin Merchants,"Noted technologist and Blockchain chief security officer Andreas Antonopoulos took to reddit today to kickstart a campaign to create an alternative to the ""We Accept Bitcoin"" signs popularly displayed by merchants.  The proposal was prompted by Yelp's decision to highlight bitcoin merchants, and follows its introduction of a new attribute for its business profiles earlier this week. This update now allows merchants to advertise that they accept bitcoin to site users.  Antonopoulos' plan calls for the creation of a new graphic design that would incorporate both the traditional ""People Like us on Yelp"" sticker used by the business with the existing ""We Accept Bitcoin"" graphic.  In addition, he listed a number of additional steps needed to see the project through to fruition, including finding a printing company, generating script to extract a list of bitcoin-accepting companies on Yelp and getting volunteers to handle the mailing and distribution.  Antonopoulos said in the post:  ""We can use this opportunity to get the bitcoin logo on the door of every Yelp business that takes bitcoin, remind them to check the new option on Yelp and create buzz around Yelp's choice to include bitcoin, driving more businesses to use it and 'rewarding' Yelp's support for bitcoin listings with rapid adoption of that feature.""  'Guerrilla marketing'  Antonopoulos called the effort a ""guerrilla/unauthorized marketing project"" that would hopefully encourage merchants to replace their existing Yelp stickers with those that feature bitcoin branding.  Said Antonopoulos:  ""Many will be happy to replace their Yelp sticker with one that also shows they accept bitcoin, which will allow us to highlight that.""  Antonopoulos also suggested that merchants may believe that Yelp issued the new stickers, adding validity to the display signs in the eyes of merchants.  Community response  At press time, the proposal had generated a healthy response on reddit, with 23 total comments, most of which expressed enthusiasm or support for the proposal.  However, not everyone believes that bitcoin should be taking this approach to spreading awareness, as at least one commenter noted that co-branding could perhaps dilute bitcoin's overall message.  Others suggested that the message might be heavy-handed considering that Yelp does not have any formal relationship with bitcoin.

42425614,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIebZh,1399056975,"Buying Beer With Bitcoin is Legal in California, Official Says","The California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) has given the green-light for bars and other alcohol-serving establishments to accept bitcoin as a form of payment.  Wired first reported that the state’s alcohol regulator did not believe such purchases violated any state laws.  The news notably follows the announcement from the Ohio Department of Public Safety, which effectively banned the use of bitcoin for alcohol sales in that state earlier this week in a move that was roundly criticized in the digital currency community.  The ABC's information officer John Carr told CoinDesk that the decision to accept bitcoin - whether for alcohol or otherwise - is perfectly legal under California law.  Carr said:  ""Bitcoin can be accepted if a bar, restaurant or liquor store or place that sells alcoholic beverages, wishes to accept it. That’s their business decision.""  State laws lead to differing decisions  Ohio released its announcement following requests for clarity from merchants participating in Bitcoin Boulevard US, a project that will find a number of Cleveland, Ohio, merchants accepting bitcoin as part of a wider promotion.  The state noted that its Liquor Control Law requires the ‘payment of money’ to be part of any alcohol purchase, and that because the law does not use the word ‘currency’, bitcoin sales are not allowed.  The ABC, by contrast, framed the choice of accepting bitcoin as a form of payment as a decision left to the businesses themselves.  Carr explained:  ""If it’s a recognized form of currency by the business and they’re willing to accept that as a consideration for a point-of-sale, that’s a decision they can make.""  California's growing bitcoin economy  However, the state government is still developing its regulatory views regarding bitcoin, and it remains to be seen how regulators and legislators will treat digital currencies in the future.  The California Department of Business Oversight (DBO) released a document earlier this month which warned investors and consumers about the potential dangers of digital currency.  Further, there is an effort in the California State Assembly to expand the definition of “lawful money” in the state to include digital currencies like bitcoin. It has been spearheaded by California Assemblyman Roger Dickinson, who sat down for an interview with CoinDesk in March.  California is home to a number of bitcoin companies and startups, including Coinbase and Kraken, among others.

42425623,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIebph,1399053642,Chinese Bitcoin Exchange FXBTC to Close Citing Central Bank Pressure,"China-based bitcoin exchange FXBTC has announced that it will shut down on 10th May.  In its announcement, FXBTC cited “unprecedented pressure” from the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) as well as restrictions on its banking services that have resulted from the central bank's policies as deciding factors.  FXBTC said that long-term financial losses stemming from what it termed a “blockade” by the PBOC resulted in the management team deciding to end the service.  According to a translated statement from CryptoCoinsNews, the management team was unable to envision a successful future due to growing negative pressure from the PBOC.  Said the team:  ""The website has been online for over a year, and has continually earned customer support despite running into problems; however, no matter how hard we work, when faced with the PBOC’s blockade, we are essentially powerless.""  They concluded: ""After long-term losses, we have finally decided to stop operating FXBTC.""  Users of the site have until 10th May to withdraw their funds, after which time FXBTC will officially close down. The exchange facilitated the sale and purchase of litecoins as well as bitcoins.  Operational challenges  The development is the latest in a broader push by the PBOC to seemingly limit the interaction its traditional financial services sector has with the digital currency community.  FXBTC was one of several exchanges to announce new deposit freezes in early April, when it received word from commercial banking partners that they were looking to terminate certain accounts.  FXBTC stopped debit-card deposits as of 3rd April and temporarily halted withdrawals. However, at the time, it confirmed that certain key processing partnerships were unaffected.  Unofficial policy ramifications  In recent months, China's central bank has quietly moved to restrict payment processors and banks in the country from dealing with domestic bitcoin exchanges. These developments - as well as rumors of future restrictions - have lead to periodic drops in the price of bitcoin.  The developments began in March, when China-based financial news site Caixin reported that the PBOC would look to more strictly enforce its December rulings. That report indicated that China would be aiming to enforce this new interpretation by 15th April, though this deadline passed without the negative consequences many feared.  However, as new reports of certain companies publicly distancing themselves from bitcoin and related services continue, many are speculating as to whether more widespread action could be forthcoming.  CoinDesk will continue to monitor this developing story.

Satoshi's Forest, the nine-acre homeless sanctuary developed by Sean's Outpost, was severely flooded, newly released pictures show.  The damage was not limited to Pensacola, however.  News reports suggest  , as much as two feet of water flooded homes and offices across Florida, which in turn lead to burst water pipes and at least one reported fatality.  An official from Sean's Outpost took to the Litecoin Talk forum to update the community on the situation, painting a vivid picture of the current needs of the charity.  Said the representative:  ""Sean’s Outpost is one of the only [organisations] running an emergency shelter. Pensacola is a designated disaster area and Sean's Outpost is one of the most active triage and recovery teams on the ground.""  As a sign of support, the wider digital currency community has been seeking to raise awareness and funding for the charity, starting donation wallets for the victims. More than 300 LTC has been raised to date (roughly $3,000) as part of the effort.  A bitcoin success story  This past March, Sean's Outpost detailed the success it's seen in its first year of operation, revealing it raised 733 BTC through its fundraising efforts.  At the time, the charity gave much of the credit for its success to the digital currency community, stating:  ""Bitcoin has allowed us to grow in ways we never thought possible.""  In January, founder Jason King embarked on a cross-country run to raise awareness for his charity and homelessness as part of an initiative dubbed Bitcoin Across America.

42425626,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIebth,1399044708,Fargo 3D Printing Marks Bitcoin Acceptance With Special Offer,"Fargo 3D Printing, a startup that specialises in 3D printer sales and services, has started accepting bitcoin payments and to mark the occasion it’s offering a 5% discount on all items purchased.  The company specialises in MakerBot printers and scanners and, as anyone familiar with 3D printers will tell you, they don’t come cheap.  MakerBot is one of the leading names in this emerging industry and its Replicator series printers are practically the industry standard, although some 3D systems fans might beg to differ.  Pricey products  The MakerBot Replicator Desktop 3D Printer is the company’s first 5th generation 3D printer and Fargo is selling it at $2,899, which is the official MSRP on the MakerBot online store.  Fargo also offers other Replicator models, as well as 3D scanners.  Of course, to actually print something you’ll also need filament and that doesn’t come cheap, either, with prices starting at $43 per 1kg spool.  Fargo's prices appear to be in line with what you would get if you dealt directly with Makerbot, so the 5% bitcoin discount sounds like an interesting deal, if you consider the cost of a mid-range MakerBot printer and a supply of filament.  What is 3D printing?  3D printing, or 'additive manufacturing' is the process of creating 3D objects by depositing layers of material one on top of the other. A 3D printable computer file guides the print head as the layers are built up.  Think of it as an office inkjet printer on steroids, but instead of laying ink over a 2D surface, layers of filament accrue vertically to form a holdable, usable object.  Many analysts believe additive manufacturing could lead to the next industrial revolution, as the technology can be used with a huge range of materials.  Even consumer-oriented models can deliver high resolution prints and can be used for rapid prototyping and other quite serious applications by small businesses.  Professional printers are in a league of their own. They tend to cost more than the average home, are designed with specific industrial applications in mind and use a range of different printing techniques and materials.  For example, a laser micro-sintering printer can turn titanium powder into a jet fuel nozzle used in a turbofan engine, while other industrial printers can print chocolate cake icing, or even Barilla pasta.  Natural fit?  Fargo’s John Schneider told CoinDesk that the discount will be available for a week or so. He added that the site got more traffic following the announcement, but there have not been many purchases as yet.  Since geeks tend to like disruptive cutting-edge technologies – of which both 3D printing and digital currencies are good examples – Fargo may find a natural customer base with the bitcoin crowd it is now trying to draw.  Perhaps the two technologies could even be combined: printed physical coins with 3D QR codes sound like an interesting start.  3D printed heads via Wikipedia",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2014/05/02/fargo-3d-printing-marks-bitcoin-acceptance-with-special-offer,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/40239ea96b6965097912093dea6bb464d5e29fb5-960x540.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The office, typical of spaces in the city’s burgeoning tech corridor, is populated by employees of bitcoin exchange Kraken.  By the time he walked in, the afternoon sun was dying, and most employees had left. Only the company CEO Jesse Powell was there, with one other employee.

He was here to prove that Kraken possessed the bitcoins it claimed to have.  Following February's panic about events at Mt. Gox, when the Japanese-based site had imploded spectacularly, taking 850,000 bitcoins with it, and leaving distraught users in its wake, Powell wanted to reassure his own users that his exchange wasn’t operating a fractional reserve.  He couldn’t very well audit his own company, though, which is why Thomas was quietly typing away at his temporary desk.  Valuable skills  So, who is Stefan Thomas, and why is he the person Powell called?  Thomas is Chief Technical Officer at Ripple Labs, a company that created its own payment protocol and prides itself on a transparent public ledger of transactions.  He was involved in bitcoin from an early stage, having produced the now famous What Is Bitcoin video, and piloted WeUseCoins – an online guide to bitcoin. He has also been the driving force behind BitcoinJS, the JavaScript implementation of the bitcoin protocol.  In short, when it comes to the technology underpinning bitcoin, Thomas knows his stuff.  “Stefan is local, he was available on short notice, he's trusted by the community and one of the few people competent enough to perform the audit,” said Powell, adding:  “We needed someone who could make criticisms of the process, suggest improvements (which he did, and we adopted), and bust us if we were trying to pull a fast one on him.”  What Kraken needed  The audit involved two different sets of data.  The first was the balance of bitcoins that Kraken held in storage, in its own publicly visible bitcoin addresses.  The second was the set of addresses that made up its customer accounts. You can think of the first as its assets, and the second as its liabilities, because each bitcoin held in a user account was effectively a bitcoin that the exchange would have to pay back at some point.  Kraken was seeking to prove that it held more bitcoins in storage than customers had in their accounts, which involved checking the totals of each of those sets of addresses.  So, how did Thomas do it?  Merkle trees, leaves and roots  The basis for the Kraken audit was the 'Merkle tree', which is a system for improving the integrity of a collection of data.  In the bitcoin block chain, the Merkle tree is used to store the transactions in a particular block. Its advantage is that it can easily produce a single hash (known as the Merkle root), which effectively hashes all the transactions in the tree.  Small groups of transactions are hashed together, and then the results of those hashes are hashed together yet again. This continues until the final hash produces the single Merkle root. This root can be used to affirm the contents of any address in the tree.  There is a Merkle tree (and corresponding root) for both the liability (customer balances) and the asset (Kraken’s wallet) sides of the audit.  Proving the assets  To produce the asset hash, Thomas was given the public addresses of Kraken’s entire wallet. He could then get the contents of those addresses from the public bitcoin blockchain.  To collect and hash that data, he used a tool written by Michael Grønager, Kraken’s COO, called Cryptoshi, which is designed to manipulate different wallet structures.  Cryptoshi uses libcoin, a cryptocurrency library based on the original Satoshi client that became the bitcoin core reference product. Thomas describes Cryptoshi as “a Swiss army knife for cryptocurrency.”  On the asset side, Thomas could assume that the Merkle tree for Kraken’s own wallet included all of the addresses under its control. It wouldn’t make sense for the exchange not to include them, if it wanted him to include its entire balance in his analysis.  Proving the liabilities  However, things are more complex on the liabilities side (the bitcoins held in Kraken’s customer addresses), for two reasons.  Firstly, a dishonest exchange trying to deceive an auditor might want to exclude customer accounts from the liabilities tree, because each of these accounts adds to the amount that the exchange owes in coins.  The easiest way to prove that it didn’t do that is simply to publish all of the balances and addresses in the tree, along with the Merkle root.  That way, anyone could simply add the contents of those addresses, and check that the balance matches that of the hashed tree. Then they could hash that same tree, and ensure that its Merkle root matched the one published as part of the audit.  That’s where the second challenge comes in. Most exchanges don’t want all of that information made public, said Thomas.  Publishing balances and addresses is a potential privacy issue, and could also reveal sensitive information about how they handle their wallets. A sum of all balances is also competitively sensitive information.  “[Kraken was] trying to err on the side of caution and try not to publish that information,” Thomas explained.  Instead, Thomas checked the sum of balances privately and testified that there were more assets than liabilities. Kraken then followed a recommendation initially proposed by bitcoin core developer Gregory Maxwell.  [post-quote]  Maxwell advised exchanges to publish the Merkle root publicly. Then, when a user connects, display their account balance at the time of the audit privately to them, along with the pieces of the tree that lie between their address and the root of the tree.  In effect, this gives the user a branch of the tree, enabling them to prove that they were at least included in this branch when it was hashed. This way the user is reassured that their address was included in the audit.  It is up to users to run a test, checking that their address was included in the overall hash, and the more such tests that occur from different branches, the greater the probability that an exchange will get caught out if it omits any addresses.  Does this mean that the balance is foolproof? Sadly, no.  Weaknesses in the process  “With any audit, there are some pretty big holes that you can't cover,” says Thomas, explaining.  “If an exchange borrows bitcoin for the purpose of the audit, that's hard to figure out. Or an exchange can buy some bitcoins themselves with their fiat holdings.”  Kraken points to other shortcomings in the process on its own page, describing the audit process. Firstly, the exchange can’t prove that others haven’t misappropriated its private keys, meaning that it can’t demonstrate unequivocally that it has exclusive access to the bitcoins in its wallet.  Secondly, the auditor has to be technically capable and trustworthy, because there are still some areas of the process where a dishonest exchange could mislead them, or for the auditor to mislead the public, possibly in collaboration with the exchange.  “A lot of these things are difficult to verify or prove,” said Thomas, adding:  “But as far as the audit goes, it does give you some confidence that the exchange is run well, and any attacks against the audit have a chance of being discovered.”  Essentially, this kind of audit is “better than nothing,” explained Thomas, who subsequently carried out another audit along similar lines for bitcoin trading platform Bitfinex.  This kind of audit may not be watertight, but it’s a best effort in a fast-changing environment, and exchanges like Kraken and Bitfinex are leading the way in reassuring customers shaken by the Mt. Gox affair.  How far should audits go, though, and what else can be done to ensure that exchanges are operating properly?  It turns out that there’s a lot more that could be done. In the second part of this investigation (coming soon), we’ll discuss those options, and some of the exchanges that are exploring them.

42425618,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIebfh,1399030087,Mt. Gox Founder Claims He Lost $50k in Exchange's Collapse,"Jed McCaleb, the original founder of bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, has said that he lost around $50,000 following the collapse of the exchange.  McCaleb pulled out of Mt. Gox and sold the bulk of the company to Mark Karpeles in 2011, but retained a 12% stake.  The $50,000, which he indicated was held in an online wallet in USD not bitcoins, was lost when the exchange went bankrupt after an alleged massive hack.  In an interview with Ars Technica, McCaleb said he is no longer involved with Mt. Gox, aside from his stake in the company.  Minority shareholder  Following his departure form the exchange, McCaleb went on to develop Ripple and earlier this year he announced a secret bitcoin-related project. For a while it seemed as if he would never cross paths with Karpeles nor Mt. Gox, but the unfolding disaster forced him to reconsider.  He told Ars Technica that recent legal disputes “brought him back” to Mt. Gox for the first time in years, and insisted that he had no involvement with the exchange since early 2011, other than the fact that he was a minority shareholder.  He never met Karpeles in person, McCaleb said, and never received any profits from him. He also later learned that Karpeles rewrote the entire Mt. Gox codebase in 2011, after taking over the company.  Back in the game?  McCaleb recently joined a group of creditors and investors headed by Sunlot Holdings, who aim to revive the troubled exchange and compensate creditors with a minority stake in the company.  While he did not offer a full explanation of his involvement in the revival plan, McCaleb's interests appear community-driven:  “When I first made Mt. Gox, I wanted to give the bitcoin community a place to gather. Although I am proud of how much the community has grown over the years, it saddens me to see the negative impact that Mt. Gox ended up having. Like many [others], I had money in Mt. Gox which I have also lost. The community deserves to find out the truth, and I am going to do what I can to help.”  However, the group's plans for Mt. Gox hit a snag yesterday. It remains unclear whether Sunlot and its supporters can make a compelling case for the revival and the settlement decision has been delayed, as Mt. Gox bankruptcy trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi appears to be pushing for liquidation.  The matter is not likely to be resolved until the summer, since most of the Japanese and US hearings have been scheduled for June and July.

42425610,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIebRh,1399023674,‘500 Startups’  to Launch Bitcoin and FinTech Investor Syndicate,"California-based incubator 500 Startups is launching an investor syndicate that will focus on bitcoin and financial technologies. The goal is to find more investors interested in putting money into the space, the company said.  Dave McClure, founding partner of 500 Startups, recently told the Silicon Valley Business Journal that this is the organisation's third syndicate for accredited investors:  “We are just getting ready to roll out our third syndicate, which will be focused around financial services and bitcoin.”  New funding avenues  The investor syndicate concept is a popular one on AngeList, a well-known resource for accredited investors to pool money and help grow nascent businesses.  500 Startups already has one syndicate for general startup investing and another focused on female founders. Each of those syndicates received $1m apiece from the firm.  The idea for the new syndicate is to help open up additional funding avenues for bitcoin and financial technology (FinTech) startups within the incubator.  500 Startups partner Sean Percival said that there is a lack of VCs in the bitcoin space, explaining:  “I think a lot of [investors] are taking a-wait-and-see approach, the other challenge is that there’s been no liquidity, there’s been no exits.”  Bitcoin focus  The incubator recently announced it has funded five bitcoin startups in its most recent class, with each company receiving $100,000 in exchange for 7% in equity. According to Percival, that funding amount valued each company at roughly $1.4m.  Putting both bitcoin and FinTech in one syndicate is the company's way of addressing the lack of investors prepared to invest money in bitcoin startups.  “I think [investors] are looking at it as, it’s so early. They like early, but this is too early,” said Percival, adding:  “Investors like big-ass markets. [Bitcoin] is a small market when you think about it.”  About 500 Startups  500 Startups is currently one of four incubators that accelerate bitcoin companies within Silicon Valley. 500’s startup batches are relatively large, averaging around 30 companies in each group.  The other incubators investing in bitcoin-focused companies include Boost VC, Plug and Play Technology Center and CrossCoin Ventures.  Both Percival and McClure have backgrounds in bitcoin and FinTech. Sean Percival was a former VP at the social network MySpace, and has carried out marketing work for bitcoin hosted wallet and information service Blockchain.  McClure was previously Director of Marketing at PayPal in the early 2000s.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/05/02/500-startups-to-launch-bitcoin-and-fintech-investor-syndicate,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d37a58b64553f5ed9ce1adb353addf5212daae5c-1000x584.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
