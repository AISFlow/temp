42382712,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9shOl,1569279953,"Bakkt's Bitcoin Futures Already Open to Retail Investors, COO Says","Well, that was a bit anticlimactic.  After two years of work and more than a year of hype and regulatory delays, the Bakkt bitcoin futures market had a lackluster first day of trading.  When the session closed at 22:00 UTC Monday, only two daily futures contracts and 71 monthly futures contracts had traded on the new platform, built by New York Stock Exchange parent company Intercontinental Exchange. The first daily contract didn't even trade until 18 hours after the launch.  Still, Adam White, the former Coinbase executive turned Bakkt COO, seemed optimistic.  He said in an interview with CNN's Julia Chatterly that the ICE futures contracts' launch meant ""for the first time ever you have an end-to-end regulated marketplace for the price discovery of bitcoin.""  White hopes that the daily and monthly futures contracts will lead price discovery, and while most of the attention is focused on the (thus far unrealized) potential for institutional money to enter the space through Bakkt, White opened the door for retail investors to enter the market, saying:  ""Bakkt is really designed for the institutional trader. So this is a futures contract. That said, we expect this futures contract to trade through retail brokerages as well, so retail customers can trade this contract.""  He also noted that ICE has been working on Bakkt and the futures contract ""for over two years."" (The project was first made public during summer 2018.)  Demand may be slow to ramp up, however.  In comments of his own to CNBC's Closing Bell, new Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Heath Tarbert also addressed the cryptocurrency space, noting that while demand for crypto derivatives products is growing, ""the demand is far below [what] we see for other commodity classes.""  Halvening  Bakkt first revealed it would offer traders a monthly contract in May, the same day it announced it had self-certified its contracts with the CFTC.  White noted Monday that Bakkt's monthly contract extends out 12 months, meaning traders will likely be able to predict where bitcoin's price might be across a year.  ""That's important not just for speculators but the actual businesses relying on the price of bitcoin – the miners are the companies that mine bitcoin – want to hedge their risk so we think this contract is the perfect fit for them,"" he explained.  The contracts might also help predict bitcoin's price movement in the months leading up to its next halvening – the quadrennial event where the number of bitcoin generated every 10 minutes is halved – he said, adding:  ""With that, you see a diminishing supply if the demand stays the same a lot of times you'll see the price increase. We think this is an important part of the futures contract, to help businesses discover what the fair market value of bitcoin is going to be through events like that.""  The next bitcoin halving is expected around May 2020.  Bakkt's monthly and daily contracts each settled at a hair under $9,900, well above spot market prices, according to CoinDesk's bitcoin price index.

42382705,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9shEh,1569270602,Crypto Startup Sues Exchange Group for $500 Million Over Soured Deal,"Canadian startup Paycase Global Corp. is suing TMX Group, for breach of contract after the operator of the Toronto Stock Exchange terminated their deal to create cryptocurrency-related products and services.  Paycase is claiming loss of revenue, loss of opportunity and loss of reputation and is demanding $500 million for damages and that TMX resumes its performance, according to a lawsuit filed Monday in Canada’s Superior Court of Justice.  A spokesperson for TMX Group said its subsidiary, Shorcan Digital Currency Network, had been working with Paycase ""to try to find a viable and mutually-agreeable business solution. We are very disappointed that Paycase has chosen to go this route. TMX disputes the claims made and we plan to defend ourselves vigorously.""    The damages sought are likely among the largest in any crypto-related lawsuit to date; previous cases have demanded as much as $100 million.  Paycase and TMX, both based in Toronto, entered into 10-year contracts for collaboration and revenue sharing on an over-the-counter (OTC) cryptocurrency brokerage desk and creation and administration of data feeds and crypto indexes and the sharing of crypto-index revenue.  According to the complaint, Paycase entered into these contracts on March 21, 2018, with TMX’s subsidiary Shorcan DCN, with the intention to launch a TMX OTC desk and data feed in the second quarter of that year. TMX would receive a cryptocurrency data aggregation platform and a global network of industry participants and leaders, and Paycase benefited from TMX’s stature and clientele, according to the suit.  At the time, Paycase chief executive Joseph Weinberg said Shorcan would be “the first-ever public crypto brokerage desk by an exchange.”  On Aug. 31, 2018, TMX added an amendment to the contract to extend by two weeks a deadline to put together a Statement of Work outlining services, consent, service levels, specifications and delivery timelines for the products. Paycase alleges that it never received this statement.  'Board issues'  Peter Conroy, president and CEO of Shorcan DCN, encouraged Paycase to buy Shorcan DCN from TMX to bypass “board approval” issues affecting the progress of the products, the suit alleges. In the middle of November, Paycase delivered an offer to purchase Shorcan DCN to Luc Fortin, the director of Shorcan DCN and Global Head of Trading with TMX Group. Paycase claims that TMX announced in or around Sept. 25 that Conroy would be moving to another TMX company but still listed him publicly as president of Shorcan DCN.  Paycase claims that Fortin controlled the business and operations of Shorcan DCN and began to dismantle those operations, including dismissing the two employees hired by Shorcan DCN dedicated to the design, implementation and ongoing operation of the TMX OTC Desk in early December.  On Dec. 6 – the same day as the dismissals – TMX sent Paycase a “Mutual Termination Agreement,” but Paycase claims no event occurred to justify the termination and that there was no termination for convenience in the contract.  Paycase rejected the termination offer and requested a meeting with TMX executives which happened in February 2019. During that time, Shorcan DCN has stopped performing its part of the contract, which Paycase says includes an obligation of continuing performance.  There was no warning of termination, but TMX promised that the products would be operational imminently, the suit claims. Meanwhile, Paycase discussed the company’s digital strategy with TMX executives and trained TMX employees.  In March 2018, TMX also announced that Bank of Montreal would provide banking services as part of the payment and settlement infrastructure of the TMX OTC Desk, similar to the models adopted by Fidelity, E*Trade and TD Ameritrade.

42382710,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9shJj,1569262516,CoinShares to Lobby Against UK Ban on Crypto Exchange-Traded Notes,"Investment platform CoinShares is urging customers to lobby the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) over impending regulations it fears will be too restrictive to crypto asset products.  In a letter to investors sent Monday, CoinShares has asked its customers to write emails and text messages to the UK regulator in support of one of its premiere products, exchange-traded notes (ETNs), which would be banned under the proposed regulation for retail investors.  As CoinShares writes:  ""We believe that the FCA has not provided sufficient evidence to justify the proposed ban. Through its consultation, the regulator makes little attempt to genuinely evidence its claims and instead 'cherry picks' data sets in order to illustrate its perception of crypto assets, ETNs and the perceived harm the FCA believes these products cause.""  Similar to a bond, ETNs provide investors with returns based on a market benchmark such as the S&P 500. CoinShares offers exchange-traded products for bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin, and XRP.  Released this past July, the FCA consultation paper claimed that ""retail consumers cannot reliably assess the value and risks of derivatives and exchange-traded products that reference certain crypto assets.”  In today's letter, CoinShares said the FCA's analysis on crypto assets ""demonstrates a lack of understanding of their functionality, value and the motivations for why an investor might seek out such products.""  In a pre-formatted email CoinShares is asking investors to send to the regulator, the firm called the ban proposal ""unwarranted"" and ""not been properly thought out or considered.""  CoinShares is asking customers -- or any proponent of cryptoassets -- to write to the FCA over the proposed ban before the Oct. 3 comment deadline.  After publication, CoinShares CSO Meltem Demirors told CoinDesk the FCA's proposed ban could set back the entire industry – inside and outside the UK – and not just CoinShares.  Said Demirors:  ""If the FCA is successful in pushing this proposed ban through, it will mean that UK retail investors who currently enjoy access to the crypto-ecosystem via our ETNs will see their access cut off; with presumably little recourse. Additionally, the FCA has been clear in their consultation to note that they intend to work with other regulators to ensure the ban is not circumvented - so the potential contagion effect is very real even beyond the UK based on the FCA’s own words.""

BSDEX will open for German retail and institutional investors slowly followed by the entire EU, the exchange noted. Like other cryptocurrency exchanges, trading will be open nearly 24/7. Speaking with CoinDesk, the exchange said it plans on adding ethereum, litecoin, and XRP euro trading pairs this year and tokenized assets sometime in 2020.  “The market in cryptocurrencies is worth billions, and more digital assets will emerge on the basis of blockchain,” CEO Dr Dirk Sturz said in the statement. “Our goal is to build up the leading European trading venue for those assets.”  Boerse Stuttgart partnered with SolarisBank on the initiative. The bank will process payments and custody euro funds.  “BSDEX will give retail and institutional investors direct access to digital assets and provide flexible and relatively low-cost trading. We believe blockchain is set to bring about significant changes in the financial industry, and we want to leverage its potential to create the trading venue of the future,” said Peter Großkopf, CTO at BSDEX, in a statement.

42382711,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9shMF,1569250741,"'Gods Unchained' Crypto Game Raises $15 Million from Naspers, Galaxy","Venture capitalists are becoming more interested in the concept of truly owning digital items.  The latest evidence: Naspers Ventures led a $15 million round in Immutable Games, the maker of Gods Unchained. Michael Novogratz's Galaxy Digital EOS VC Fund also participated in the Series A funding round.  Similar to the mega-hit Hearthstone, Gods Unchained is a digital card game – but built for non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  Sam Englebardt, the co-founder of Galaxy Digital, said in a press release:  “True ownership of digital objects reflects the next paradigm for interactive content by aligning the long-term incentives of publishers, developers, creators and players.""  Naspers is a giant firm based in South Africa with a wide array of investments, including large bets on Flipkart and Tencent.  ""We believe tremendous economic value can be unlocked in digital worlds using blockchain technology,” Naspers Investment Lead Banafsheh Fathieh said in a statement.  The company also participated in a round for DappRadar, announced earlier this month.  The new funding for Immutable follows a $2.4 million seed round from Coinbase Ventures and other investors.  Similarly, Dapper Labs, the firm behind the ERC-720 standard that spurred the boom in NFTs with its CrypoKitties game, just announced an $11 million round led by Andreessen Horowitz.  These are significant bets by some of the biggest investors in crypto.  Indeed, Englebardt noted that his firm is making a variety of similar investments, but said, ""Gods Unchained is in a class by itself amongst trading card games.""  The trend is strong enough that EA, a company behind gigantic games like the FIFA and Madden series, trolled crypto on Thursday by tweeting ""invest in Crypto"" – a sly reference to a new Apex Legends character.  Crypto pantheon  Players who participate in Gods Unchained really will have a crypto option, though, because ownership of its cards can be registered on ethereum, such that players really own their cards and their cards' scarcity is provable.  This creates new challenges.  ""Developing decentralized games and economies isn’t trivial, and carries with it existential risks,"" Immutable CEO James Ferguson told CoinDesk in a statement. ""Developers are forced to solve problems that don’t exist with centralized systems.""  Nevertheless, Gods Unchained has seen a response. Immutable reports that it's sold more than 4 million cards, breaking $4.5 million in revenue through a “Genesis Sale"" that closes Oct. 10.  Despite their success, they've also learned a lot about the complexity engendered by using a blockchain to run a game ecosystem.  That's why the company is turning over the underlying software that powers Gods Unchained to other developers with its Immutable Platform.  Beyond enabling more NFT games, Ferguson said, ""We’re also building a suite of interconnected products aimed to solve the highest areas of friction users face when trying to interact with this technology.""  Ferguson did not describe how the platform fits into the company's business model. Other video game companies have created game engines that they then license to other developers, such as Epic Games and its Unreal Engine.  User experience  Immutable recently made a bit of a departure from the pure decentralization ethos by creating a typical sign-on for users to participate in Gods Unchained.  At first, an ethereum wallet was all that was needed to interact with the site, but now users need to create an account on the website itself.  Ferguson said this is ""an effort to reduce confusion amongst new users and improve the general user experience.""  With tournaments every weekend, Immutable says it is growing its user base.  ""We’re running a raffle where players can earn ERC-20 tokens that unlock prizes by playing the game and giving away beta access to their friends,"" Ferguson said.  Ferguson told CoinDesk:  ""The game itself has been designed by heavyweights to be easy to learn, but complex to master.""

42382717,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9shV3,1569247204,Startup Bringing Zero-Knowledge Proofs to Ethereum Raises $2 Million,"The number of initiatives dedicated to scaling the ethereum blockchain is manifold. Ethereum 2.0, Plasma, Raiden, zk-SNARKs – the list goes on.  On Monday, blockchain research and development startup Matter Labs announced a $2 million seed round led by Placeholder VC to develop a new scaling initiative atop the ethereum blockchain.  Speaking to the goals of the initiative, Matter Labs co-founder Alex Gluchowski said:  “Our product will be much more scalable [than ethereum today] without sacrificing decentralization or security. … You will be able to deposit any funds on it and it will be as safe as depositing on ethereum itself.”  Matter Labs’ technology is based on a novel form of cryptography known as zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). Leveraging this “mathematical magic,” in the words of Gluchowski, transactions on ethereum could be significantly sped up and cheaper to deploy.  “With what we’re building … payments [on ethereum] will be very cheap and have very high throughput,” said Gluchowski. “Not only very cheap but predictively cheap because the bulk of the cost will be coming from [ZKP] computation.”  At the same time, Gluchowski told CoinDesk the research into leveraging ZKPs as a scaling solution on ethereum is still “very early.” At present, Matter Labs has built a prototype of its scalable payments platform and is working towards creating a new minimum viable product over the coming months.  Investor buy-in  A number of other venture capital firms joined Placeholder in the funding round, including 1kx, Dekrypt, Hashed and Dragonfly Capital Partners.  Hashed CEO and managing partner Simon Seojoon Kim told CoinDesk:  “We believe the on-chain data availability and ... scaling solution the Matter Labs team is building will be the integral piece in accelerating the growth of [ethereum’s decentralized finance] space.”  Dekrypt co-founder Howard Wu also added that using ZKPs to wrap “hundreds of thousands of transactions” on ethereum into succinct, verifiable proofs is a “really cool way to try and bring scalability to ethereum.”  Launched officially in December 2018, Matter Labs has also received funding from the Ethereum Foundation, the oldest non-profit dedicated to ethereum protocol development.  Gluchowski said Matter Labs has “received over $100,000 in several different grants” from the Ethereum Foundation over the course of 2019.

42382706,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9shHD,1569246352,"Overstock Appoints New CEO, Remains Committed to Blockchain","Online retail giant Overstock has announced that Jonathan Johnson – who's led the firm in a temporary role since the shock departure of its previous chief executive Patrick Byrne – is now its permanent CEO.  In an announcement emailed to CoinDesk Monday, the company said Johnson had been appointed by its board, having served as interim CEO since Aug. 22. That's notably when Byrne stepped down as CEO and member of the Overstock board after admitting to a three-year relationship with Maria Butina, a Russian agent currently serving 18 months in prison.  Johnson, who also heads Overstock's blockchain accelerator Medici Ventures, said at the time that he was “confident that Overstock’s future – both in retail and blockchain – is bright.”  In today's announcement, he echoed the sentiment, saying:  “Overstock has two unique businesses. I have run both, and I know how to unlock the value in each. I’m confident we can rapidly return our retail business to profitable growth. Our transformative blockchain businesses continue to lead their respective industries by getting real products into production.”  In retail guidance provided along with the news, Overstock set out a number of market factors that it expects to affect profitability, but added: “In spite of these recent headwinds, we’re confident in our retail strategy.”  The company has had a turbulent two months for internal reasons too. Before leaving the company, Byrne had apparently attempted to stymie short sellers he believed were targeting the firm by controversially opting to issue Overstock's next investor dividend through a digital asset on the firm's subsidiary exchange tZERO. It was to have blocked investors from trading the asset for six months and restricted the activity to a single platform.  However, Overstock last week sought to soften its stance by restructuring the dividend to make it freely tradeable at issuance.  A day later, typically outspoken Byrne dumped his 13 percent stake in the company, which he founded 20 years ago, to buy cryptocurrency and precious metals, saying it was an effort to fight his ""Deep State"" enemies at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  In today's announcement, Overstock added that it's also appointed former principal financial officer Robert Hughes as acting chief financial officer after the resignation of Greg Iverson from the role last week.

Artificial General Intelligence is a branch of AI that focuses on a computer’s ability to learn intellectual tasks. Whereas existing AI might learn to read characters on a page, for example, a true AGI system might intuit how to write the book.  In a joint statement, Dr. Ben Goertzel, SingularityNET CEO, said, “The scale of the AGI deployments needed by a partner like Cisco is going to be tremendous, and we are working hard to make sure our AGI tools and our blockchain-based platform is up to the task.”  SingularityNET’s platform  democratizes AI by decentralizing its source, preventing any single force or player from hoarding computers’ capacity to learn.  Cisco  and SingularityNET see the potential in building AGI together, according to Goertzel. He said this technology is “expected to provide tremendous commercial benefit to whomever develops it.”  “This benefit may initially take the form of a generation of ‘Narrow AGI’ systems that infuse general intelligence into products in specific vertical markets like, say, advertising, medical research, computer networking or financial analytic,” he said.  Cisco’s role in worldwide technology kickstarts that goal.  “To really build a global decentralized thinking machine we are going to need to put a lot of complicated ingredients together, and the collaboration between Cisco and SingularityNET has the potential to accelerate things tremendously,” Goertzel said.

42382700,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9shAv,1569243617,Crypto Exchange Giant Binance to Launch US Trading Tuesday,"Binance.US, the American arm of cryptocurrency exchange giant Binance, has announced it will start trading fiat-crypto and crypto-crypto trading pairs on Tuesday.  The trading platform will list seven cryptocurrencies immediately upon the launch, including bitcoin, Binance coin (BNB), ethereum, XRP, bitcoin cash, litecoin and Tether's USDT.  Binance.us also revealed it will soon open deposits for another five assets: cardano (ADA), basic attention token (BAT), ethereum classic (ETC), stellar's XLM and 0x.  Last Wednesday, the new exchange started to open for registration and deposits, but did not disclose a specific date for an official launch.  In the weeks ahead, the platform will roll out additional cryptocurrencies that meet U.S. regulations and compliance standards based on its Digital Asset Risk Assessment Framework. (Binance’s recently launched dollar-linked stablecoin BUSD is notably not supported.)  Users who already have deposits with Binance.com will not see their funds automatically transferred to the U.S. platform, Binance.US CEO Catherine Coley previously told CoinDesk. Users for the new exchange will also receive a $15 referral bonus until Nov. 1.  Regulatory barriers  In June, the Malta-based Binance, initially launched in China, revealed that stateside users of its global platform Binance.com were barred from trading.  In the same month, the company said it would partner with California-based BAM Trading Services to set up Binance.US as its US platform. BAM is registered as a money services business with the U.S. Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) with an address listed in San Francisco, California.  While the U.S. entity would clear regulatory and compliance barriers, the new platform is still not supported by 13 states, as of Sept. 23, according to a statement from the company.  Users in those 13 states, including New York, Florida and Texas, cannot register for an account at Binance.US. Coley previously explained that the U.S. rollout is to be “gradual” with the 13 states not supported at launch.  The exchange said it would also strengthen its compliance and security practices through partnerships, most notably with software provider Chainalysis and KYC/AML tool provider IdentityMind.  Global expansion  The move is part of a larger expansion by Binance, which launched a fiat-to-crypto exchange on the island of Jersey, a British self-governing dependency in January.  Through that exchange, which caters to traders in Europe and the U.K, its users can trade bitcoin and ethereum against the British pound and the euro.  The Jersey arm listed the cryptocurrency exchange’s own British pound-backed stablecoin, Binance GBP (BGBP), offered on the fiat-to-crypto platform due to trader demand for more stablecoin options, the company said.  With its latest launch in the U.S., Binance has also been trying to push its US dollar-backed stablecoin posing as a potential rival against Libra. BUSD has been approved by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).

42382721,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9shYp,1569238210,Bitcoin Price Indicator is Most Bearish Since December,"View  Bitcoin’s weekly moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram is reporting strongest bearish bias since December, suggesting the cryptocurrency may soon dive out of a narrowing price range.  Daily chart indicators are also biased bearish. A range breakdown, if confirmed, would open the doors for a drop below $9,000.  A range breakout would imply a resumption of the rally from April's low of $4,000 and could yield a sustained move above key resistance at $12,000.      Bitcoin's three-months of sideways trading may soon end with a notable price drop, as key indicator is reporting strongest bearish bias in nine months.  The leading cryptocurrency's stellar rally from April's low of $4,000 ran out of steam at highs above $13,880 at the end of June. Since then, BTC has produced a series of lower highs well above $11,000 and higher lows in $9,000 to $10,000 range.  With a reward halving (supply cut) due next year, many investors are expecting the ongoing consolidation to end with a bullish breakout. The cryptocurrency is also expected to receive a boost from Bakkt's launch of physically-settled bitcoin futures.  However, the weekly MACD histogram – an indicator used to identify trend changes and the momentum of the bearish or bullish movement – is calling a range breakdown.  The histogram crossed below zero in August, confirming a bullish-to-bearish trend change and is now seen at -206, the lowest level since the last week of December 2018, as seen in the chart below.  Weekly chart  The bearish bias is currently the strongest in nine-months, according to the MACD.  Technical analysts would argue that the MACD is based on moving averages and tends to lag price. While that is true, the indicator has produced reliable trend reversal signals in the past.  For instance, the indicator crossed above zero in February, indicating a bullish reversal and the cryptocurrency broke into a bull market with a high-volume move to $5,000 in the first week of April.  In another example, the MACD crossed below zero and fell to -8.18 in the second week of November 2018, following which prices fell sharply below $5,000.  Also, other indicators are aligning in favor of the bears. Notably, the chaikin money flow index, which incorporates both prices and volumes, is currently seen at 0.08, the lowest level since April 8, meaning the buying pressure at is at the weakest in 5.5 months.  Daily chart  BTC created a bullish hammer last Thursday, but so far, that has failed to draw bids. In fact, the follow-through has been bearish – prices are currently down more than $400 from the hammer candle's high of $10,480.  Here too, the MACD has crossed below zero and the 14-day relative strength index is reporting bearish conditions with a below-50 print.  BTC, therefore, risks falling to the contracting triangle support, currently at $9,482. A UTC close below that level could yield a sell-off to levels below $9,000.  Meanwhile, a high-volume close above the upper edge, currently at $10,758 would imply a resumption of the bull market and open the doors for $12,000.

The prototype platform, launched under its digital assets subsidiary SIX Digital Exchange (SDX), is expected to see more functionality added as it approaches a full launch slated for Q4 2020, according to an announcement emailed to CoinDesk on Monday.  The platform as it stands is aimed to ""showcase the future of financial markets,"" and as well as obtain feedback from early testers.  SDX further said it intends to show that a distributed ledger technology (DLT)-based CSD can ""be integrated with a central order-book stock exchange model to ensure fair market conditions for all.""  Thomas Zeeb, chairman of SDX and member SIX's executive board, said:  “The launch of this prototype is a major milestone in creating a credible digital infrastructure for moving our industry forward. We are now one step closer to demonstrating the viability of our vision for the financial markets of the future and, ultimately, for the way people and businesses access capital.”  Early functionality of the platform for ""test cases"" will cover issuance of digital security tokens, live trading and instant settlement.  ""This will include the cash-leg of the transaction embracing the concept of a payment token as well as access to a distributed portal where it would be possible to monitor transactions across specific DLT member nodes."" according to the announcement.  SDX's trading facility will be similar to the SIX infrastructure, while token issuance will utilize SIX's Connexor reporting service and functionality.  Ultimately, SDX aims to enable instant settlement with no counterparty risk or requirement for default fund collateral at a central counterparty. ""This implies that if the buy and sell-side have the necessary cash and assets to fulfil a trade, settlement will occur instantly,"" said SDX.  Phase two of the prototype is expected to be ready in ""coming months,"" and will take in feedback from this initial phase. It will also add the first post-trade and digital custody functionality, according to SDX. Exchange users will be able to hold their assets on the SDX in a ""distributed way,"" with access through the use of a private key.

42374508,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWva0D9,1569234607,Bakkt Exchange's Bitcoin Futures See Slow Start on First Day of Trading,"Trading of Bakkt's physically-backed bitcoin futures saw something of a slow start at launch Monday.  Minutes after the launch at 12:00 UTC, the first Bakkt/ICE futures contract changed hands at $10,115. The number of contracts in the first hour stood at just 5 total. At press time (10 or so hours later), 28 contracts had been traded, with just one at a sub-$10,000 price.  And that's just for the monthly bitcoin contract. For the daily bitcoin contract – arguably Bakkt's flagship product – the volume looks even more tepid.  The first such contract appears to have been traded some 18 hours after Bakkt went live, at a price of $9,975.00, according to the data feed on ICE's website.  ""I’m shocked there isn’t any volume,"" said Lanre Sarumi, CEO of LevelTradingField. ""I absolutely thought that contract was going to fly out of the gate. Very odd.""  By that time, trading in the monthly contract totaled 66 bitcoin.  The daily settling futures contract has been part of Bakkt's vision from the get-go; the monthly one was added only later after ICE met delays getting regulatory approval for the platform.  Bakkt didn't respond to several requests for comment Monday.  Some online commentators believe the slow start is a natural progression for regulated futures products.  Su Zhu, CEO and CIO of Singapore-based hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, said that most regulated futures contracts see low adoption on the first day, simply because not all futures brokers are ready to clear them.  Popular analyst Joseph Young also echoed the sentiment via a tweet arguing that volumes will rise as a brokers ""get ready.""  It will be interesting to see if trading volumes pick up during the week ahead, according to market analyst Alex Kruger.  Bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) registered a volume of $460 million in its first week in December 2017. So far, Bakkt futures have registered a volume of just over $280,000.  Bitcoin drops on Bakkt launch  The bitcoin market has seen no discernible boost from the launch. The spot price of bitcoin (BTC) dropped below $10,000 at 00:17 UTC near today’s open trading period.  Many observers believe Bakkt's physically-settled futures are a game-changer and could bring in more institutional volume. Cryptocurrency analyst and trader Scott Melker in August called Bakkt futures the most bullish development in the history of bitcoin. This is due to the fact that physically delivered futures require the actual purchase of bitcoins.  That said, exactly how impactful the launch will be to the markets and crypto in general remains speculative. Moreover, a rise in trading volumes does not always lead to bullish price action – after all, futures can be utilized to create short positions.  Hence, viewing a Bakkt-driven rise in volumes as a price-bullish development could prove costly for traders.  Further, BTC suffered losses following the launch of CME and CBOE futures in December 2017, as seen in the chart below.  Daily chart  As can be seen, the market started its almost 90 percent from BTC's all-time spot price high of $20,000 after the launch of bitcoin futures in late 2017.  Further, the market likely priced in the Bakkt launch in August. Back then, the futures launch announcement from the Bakkt Trust Company, a subsidiary of Bakkt Holdings – which is licensed by the State of New York to provide custody of bitcoin – stoked investor sentiment on August 17 and prices rose to $10,940.  The markets soon sobered up and a swift rejection followed, bringing a roughly 14.53 percent drawdown to $9,300 by August 29.  UPDATE (19:20 UTC): This article was updated with additional details about trading volume for Bakkt's monthly and daily bitcoin contracts.

The WhatsMiner M20 series are priced at between $1,500 to $2,000, which means the delivery of a total of 200,000 units would be worth around $350 million (assuming equal sales between both models). Currently, investors placing pre-orders for new mining equipment will have to wait until January 2020 to receive the products.  While Yang did not indicate an approximate gross margin for WhatsMiner's sales, industry rivals including Avalon miner maker Canaan and AntMiner maker Bitmain both have had a gross profit margin of about 50 percent for 2017, based on the firms' financial disclosures made in initial public offering filings in 2018.  Surging hash rate  The WhatsMiner series has the computing capability of about 55 tera hashes per second (TH/s) on average, so 200,000 miners could contribute about 11 exahashes per second (EH/s) to the total bitcoin hash rate.  Since mid June, the bitcoin network's mining power has jumped by over 30 EH/s, or about 60 percent, in part thanks to the cheap hydropower electricity in China's southwestern region, as well as bitcoin's price bull run this year.  Yang went on to estimate that, including delivery of mining equipment from major miner manufacturers up until the end of the year, the total network has rate could increase by another 30 percent, saying:  ""In a short term, based on information I have seen and based on our current production capacity, the bitcoin network's total hash rate is estimated to reach 120 EH/s by the end of this year.""  Yang's comments were, in part, a response to concerns that some of the products that should have been delivered between July and September had been delayed.  Bowing to the audience as an apology, Yang explained the holdup was due to a delay from its chip supplier, Samsung.  ""The existing issues with the delay will likely be mitigated by late October. The entirely supply chain should have a primary, secondary and third supplier. This year we only have one supplier so our hands are also tied. Currently, the rapid development of 5G network has resulted in a major delay [of chips prioritized for MicroBT],"" he told the audience.  Indeed, the supply capacity from chip manufacturers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), as well as Samsung, remains a major bottleneck for the production capacity of all cryptocurrency miner makers.  ""Honestly, crypto miner manufacturers are still behind other electronic device makers like smartphones, PCs and computers. The supply [for us] is very tight,"" Yang said.

42430974,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMz4Fh,1569225618,What Billions in Fed Repo Injections Reveal About the Promise of Bitcoin,"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.    ---------------    Last week, the Federal Reserve injected $278 billion into the securities repurchase, or “repo,” market over four days, all so that banks could meet their liquidity needs. It was the first time the Fed had intervened in this vital interbank market, where banks’ pawn financial assets to fund overnight cash needs, since the financial crisis of 2008.  Fed officials and bankers dismissed the rare liquidity breakdown as a hiccup stemming from a series of coincidental factors in bond markets and corporate tax payments. It wasn’t a very comforting explanation, not when other economic warning signs are flashing, too: $17 trillion in bonds worldwide showing negative yields; a worsening U.S.-China trade war; and manufacturing indicators signaling an impending global recession.  Predictably, certain crypto types have viewed this alarming scenario with glee. More than a few HODLing tweeters responded to the repo story with two words of advice: “buy bitcoin.”  But it’s actually hard to predict what all this means for crypto markets, at least in the short- to medium-term.  If and when a 2008-like financial panic takes hold, will bitcoin rally as a new kind of uncorrelated “safe haven” or will it decline in a broad-based “risk-off” dumping of all things speculative? (Notwithstanding a sharp dip and rebound midway through last week, bitcoin has proven quite stable of late, at least by its own volatile standards.)  Other questions: do these vulnerabilities in traditional credit markets highlight the promise of new blockchain-based ideas? For example, would wider use of security tokens allow speedier settlement and, by extension, reduced counterparty risks and greater market confidence? Or, far more radically, would MakerDAO’s on-chain #DeFi lending markets enable a more reliable clearing mechanism, with collateral calls locked in by a decentralized protocol? Or might these underdeveloped ideas simply be recipes for systemic risk, a single hack or software glitch away from setting off a vicious spiral of collateral calls and bankruptcies?  The jury is out on all this untested stuff.  Still, if nothing else, the many signs of stress in the traditional financial system offer a valuable framework for thinking about how the world could be different and the role blockchain technology might play in enabling that new world.  Let’s look at some of them:  Negative-yields  The rare phenomenon, where creditors are essentially paying issuers for the privilege of lending them money – head scratcher, right? – reflects excessive demand for “safe” assets, especially for government-issued bonds. It has historically been a strong indicator of impending recession, since it reflects an overwhelming reluctance among investors to take on risk.  Now, another way of thinking about that reluctance is to express it as a perceived shortage of good investment opportunities. That perception can be fueled by a worsening economic outlook, but it’s also dictated by the barriers to entry that make it difficult for otherwise investable businesses of offer new opportunities.  Here, certain blockchain-based credit ideas offer hope. There’s the prospect for distributed-ledger asset registries that better track collateral and enable new emerging-market lending in developing-country land, commodities and energy markets. Or there are ideas such as having exporters tokenize their receivables to tackle a major structural limit on global trade finance, where a majority of small-and-medium enterprise are denied letters of credit because bankers don’t trust their documentation.  Effective use of blockchain technology could boost trust in assets and lien registries and help bring to life the $20 trillion in “dead capital” that economist Hernando de Soto says the world’s poor are sitting on.  Just as importantly, it would open a world of new alternative assets to draw in investors’ capital, giving them less of a reason to park it in low-yielding bonds.  Global economic slowdown  An alarming, synchronized downturn in manufacturing indicators, most notably in purchasing manager indexes, which measure current and future business spending on inventory and equipment, flows directly from the U.S.-China trade war. In cutting off Chinese goods exporters from U.S. consumer markets and driving up costs for their U.S. importers – and vice versa for U.S. farmers selling to food distributors in China – the conflict has added a massive new burden on global economic activity.  But let’s look at the starting point for this trade battle. It lies in American companies’ mostly legitimate complaints about China’s mercantilist, centrally planned approach to supporting Chinese companies at their expense, all enabled by a system of surveillance and control over people and businesses. This where there’s a crypto angle.  Cryptocurrency and other decentralizing technologies could work against the Chinese government’s capacity to control its economy in this interventionist manner. If Chinese businesses and hundreds of millions of Chinese citizens used bitcoin to circumvent capital controls, for example, the ever-present risk of monetary flight would act as a pressure valve, compelling Beijing to pursue a more open economic model to maintain competitiveness. That would give anti-free-traders like President Trump less of an excuse to ratchet up protectionist attacks against it.  The repo intervention  Some innovators have sought to apply blockchain technology to the back-office structural problems that periodically roil money markets, such as those now manifest in repo. They see a distributed ledger as a superior mechanism for tracking the IOUs of money and pawned securities upon which inter-institutional credit markets are based.  One was former J.P. Morgan credit market maven Blythe Masters, who founded Digital Asset Holdings in 2014 on the idea that on-chain settlement and a universally auditable ledger could improve transparency in global finance’s opaque, complex matrix of interconnected credit relationships. This way, she argued, it could mitigate the mistrust and counterparty risks that fueled the financial crisis.  The DAH model and those of others working on back-office blockchain solutions for capital markets have not come to fruition. This is at least partly due to the reluctance of incumbent financial institutions and their regulators to kill off existing functions that a blockchain would make redundant; they instead designed cumbersome hybrid distributed-ledger models that sustained vested interests but were expensive and difficult to collectively implement.  Either way, a blockchain back-office fix for traditional finance isn’t coming any time soon – whether because of internal politics or the limitation of the technology.  Shining a light  A more important question is why we even tolerate a system that’s so vulnerable to those back-end markets’ problems at all. The only reason central banks ever intervene to support interbank credit markets is because society’s means of payment depends on avoiding cash shortfalls and maintaining confidence in fractional-reserve banking.  If banks don’t have enough cash to meet short-term creditor calls, they would suffer runs on their deposits, companies wouldn’t make payroll, tenants would have to skip rent, ATMs would run out of banknotes, etc. The economy would seize up. The worst of it is that, because of this ever-present threat, banks hold our political system to ransom, knowing that they can always rely bailouts: the too-big-to-fail problem.  But what if banks just stuck to longer-term lending? What if there were no checking accounts or debit/credit cards, and we simply exchanged value with each other via cash or digital currencies that we hold ourselves?  If people used bitcoin, or fiat-backed stablecoins or central bank digital currencies to exchange value instead of the IOUs of an inherently fragile fractional reserve banking system, institutional cash shortages simply wouldn’t matter as much. Banks’ biggest creditors might take a hit against their risk-adjusted positions and their stock prices would fall, but the rest of us, including the Fed, could ignore the problem.  As the journalist and commentator Heidi Moore astutely observed in a tweetstorm last week, the reason the repo market tumult is so worrying is because it speaks directly to the core problem of trust in the banking system.  If nothing else, this is where blockchain technology provides a valuable lens with which to assess the current stress in the financial system. It helps us think about how the trust problem creates vulnerabilities, power imbalances and systemic risks and how we might design a system that’s better able to resolve it.

42430983,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMz4Zh,1569212128,Facebook Reveals Libra Crypto's Currency Basket Breakdown: Report,"Facebook has reportedly revealed the percentage breakdown of a basket of global currencies that will underpin its Libra cryptocurrency.  While it's already known that 50 percent of the basket will be on the U.S. dollar, the German newspaper Der Spiegel said in a report on Friday that the remaining portion will consist of the euro, the yen, the British pound and the Singapore dollar, with 18 percent, 14 percent, 11 percent, and seven percent, respectively.  The basket will not include the Chinese yuan, the legal tender of the world's second-largest economy. A report from Reuters suggested excluding the Chinese yuan could help with Libra's plan in the U.S. given the concerns over the tense trade relationship between the two countries.  The German newspaper said Facebook revealed the percentage breakdown in a letter to Fabio De Masi, a German legislator and former member of the European Parliament.  The newspaper describes him as a ""left-wing"" politician who believes Libra is a threat to democracy, freedom and financial stability. He is particularly concerned that Libra will not be backed by deposit insurance and that corporate sponsors of the coin may use information harvested from its use, according to Der Spiegel.  Libra, a stablecoin that is designed to anchor to a basket of currencies to facilitate global payments and is governed by a consortium led by Facebook with members including Visa, Uber, and PayPal, has been at the center of controversy since Facebook announced the plan in June.  Lawmakers and regulators in the U.S. have raised concerns over the initiative, while the French finance minister even said the nation plans to block Libra. A board member at the European Central Bank also warned the threat posed by Libra in a recent report. Risks have been cited in addition to concerns about the possible loss of economic sovereignty and control over monetary policy.  China views the currency as a direct threat and is developing its own central bank digital currency (CBDC) to meet the challenge posed by Libra, although the structure proposed by the People's Bank of China (PBoC) suggests more a glorified payments system than a true cryptocurrency.  Some members of the Libra Association, as the consortium is known, may exit the group because of the controversy, but most insist that they will stay in.

42430979,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMz4Ph,1569200409,Bakkt Is Finally Launching Its Bitcoin Futures Today. Here's What to Expect,"Bakkt is finally here.  After two delays and 13 months of questions, the Intercontinental Exchange-backed bitcoin warehouse and futures contract facilitator is launching Monday, opening the door for institutional investors to take positions on the cryptocurrency in a federally regulated venue.  Trading is set to open at midnight UTC and close at 22:00. For the first time, interested observers will be able to see just how much pent-up demand there is among big-money traders for this hotly anticipated service. Bakkt’s data feed will be freely available through June of next year, after which it will require a subscription, according to a company FAQ.  As often noted, Bakkt’s futures will be physically settled, meaning buyers receive bitcoin at expiration, whereas the futures available since 2017 at the Chicago exchange CME Group are cash-settled – essentially side bets on the cryptocurrency’s price.  But what may be most unique about ICE’s bitcoin futures contracts is that they expire after a day. According to the daily contract’s specifications, the bitcoin will be delivered on the second business day after the contract’s date.  For most commodities – frozen concentrated orange juice, cocoa, what have you – the underlying asset is typically not delivered for at least 30 days (although ICE also offers one-day contracts for silver and gold).  While Bakkt is also offering a 30-day bitcoin futures contract, the one-day version will essentially allow institutions to buy or sell bitcoin in a way that’s more familiar to them than the helter-skelter world of crypto exchanges.  As Lanre Sarumi, CEO of crypto derivatives exchange operator LevelTradingField, put it:  “The dailies make their offering like the cash market, but with the ability to short. That’s huge.”  The contract is “well-designed,” Sarumi added. “The basis to the cash market would be very tight. It’ll be interesting to see if it’s the lead or the follower. In theory the cash market should dictate the price of the derivatives [futures] market. In practice, it’s the other way around for a lot of commodities.”  For this reason, Sarumi said he believes the daily contract “will come out of the gate strong.”  Remain calm  That being said, it is unlikely that ICE’s new futures contracts will have a significant near-term impact on the general crypto market, particularly given the company is not looking for retail customers, who make up the bulk of traders still.  Bakkt anticipates significant institutional demand for its futures contract, though it remains to be seen how significant it actually is.  “We could see decent trading volumes for the product,” said John Todaro, director of research at TradeBlock, a provider of institutional trading tools. “I would expect, however, that the demand would be somewhat in line with current cash-settled contracts, such as those offered by the CME.”  Trading volumes for derivatives contracts traditionally outpace trading volumes seen in the underlying spot market, Todaro told CoinDesk.  “As the digital currency space continues to mature we should see an increase in volumes for these products relative to spot over time,” he said.  However, it is unlikely that there will be an immediate surge in demand. Institutional adoption won’t occur with a single catalyst, Todaro said, adding:  “It will take time for these entities to become comfortable with the asset class, identify strategies that are best used to trade the space, understand crypto market liquidity, and also understand the different regulatory and tax obligations across jurisdictions they operate in.”  It is unclear how much bitcoin has been sent to Bakkt since the New York Stock Exchange’s sister company opened its warehouse up for customers to deposit bitcoin on Sept. 6. Each customer must pledge a minimum $3,900 of assets in collateral to purchase a contract. (Speculators must pledge nearly $4,300.)  Bakkt has not disclosed any addresses for its custodian’s wallet or said how much bitcoin has been deposited since the warehouse opened this month. A spokesperson did not answer questions about the matter by deadline.  Broader impact  Caveats aside, ICE launching futures contracts is a significant move for the industry. Todaro noted that “traditional financial institutions are quite conservative.”  “The offering demonstrates that more and more Wall Street institutions are taking a close look at digital currencies and want to gain exposure to this new asset class,” he said.  It is possible that “some of the recent positive market moves across digital currencies have been from traders acting on the Bakkt launch,” Todaro said.  Bakkt’s launch may be a positive sign for other highly anticipated products in the U.S., such as a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Last week. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Jay Clayton expressed concerns with the cryptocurrency market’s maturity.  Derivatives products, like futures contracts, are more tightly regulated than the underlying spot market, and may be more comforting to regulators and potential institutional customers alike.  Todaro concluded:  “This offering, in addition to the CME's, can help regulators become more comfortable with digital asset trading and market infrastructure.”  Bakkt CEO Kelly Loeffler image via CoinDesk archives",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/09/23/bakkt-is-finally-launching-its-bitcoin-futures-today-heres-what-to-expect,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ab2c5e59481b20b73b3458b70f5acd6913e25de6-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
