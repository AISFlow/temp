42377765,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73X2D,1415467941,Robocoin Policy Change Ignites Fears Over Centralisation,"A vocal minority of operators are taking a stand against major bitcoin ATM manufacturer Robocoin over its decision to cut ties with any business partners that refuse to upgrade to its new proprietary wallet platform.  At press time, the operators of eight machines have confirmed to CoinDesk that their Robocoin bitcoin ATM units had gone offline over the issue.  Robocoin  has some 45 machines in operation globally, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin ATM Map. The operators of these eight machines have refused to upgrade to the company’s Robocoin 2.0 platform, which will require them to collect customer information pursuant to KYC standards and direct customers to the company's own wallet.  Robocoin indicated that any operator who failed to upgrade had their machines disabled remotely as of 3:00am BST on 7th November. Following the decision, some operators reported they were seeking to bring their machines back online with the help of new software.  Co-founder and CTO of Robocoin John Russell and CEO Jordan Kelley sought to frame the customer outrage as a response to the company's new KYC standards, while arguing that its new wallet service was necessary as it could no longer afford to continue providing retail customers of its machines with poor experiences.  Kelley told CoinDesk:  ""We can't afford customers having bad experiences or having downtime or having bitcoin not being delivered on time because an outside service goes down.""  Russell suggested that the new software upgrade addresses a litany of issues reported by operators and customers, while Kelley stressed that end users would still be able to transfer bitcoin they receive from their Robocoin wallet to another wallet of choice, thereby negating any fears that the company may be making a move toward centralisatoin.  ""We pioneered a new proof of solvency that guarantees we are full reserve,"" the company said in an email to operators. ""We will be publishing this scheme shortly, we're just waiting until we are in full release.""  Overall, the announcement garnered mixed reactions, both among Robocoin operators and in the wider bitcoin community.  While bitcoin’s Reddit community was hostile to what they saw as the company’s move away from bitcoin's decentralised roots, its decision to adopt KYC standards was applauded by prominent community members such as Bitcoin Foundation board member Jon Matonis on Twitter as a smart business move.  Campaign against Robocoin  The most vocal operator was UK-based Robocoin operator Jonathan James Harrison, who sought to rally his peers against the proposal through a mass email to roughly 50 Robocoin ATM operators.  ""We as robocoin operators need to unite together and install open-source software on our machines and cut Jordan [Kelley] out and his fees out,"" he wrote.  Harrison had previously promised to continue to operate the Robocoin 1.0 version on his ATMs, stating that he would bring negative exposure to the company should it go through with taking his machines offline. In particular, he has taken aim at what he considers is the Robocoin 2.0 platform's move toward centralisation, while alleging that the company had previously told him he would be able to keep the Robocoin 1.0 platform.  ""Kelley had said that operators can 'absolutely' choose to update their system,"" he said. ""I have told you and everyone at Robocoin that Satoshipoint customers will not be using this centralised Robocoin wallet you have created and you have said we do not have to. I have explained why we cannot and will not have our customers using this system. I have asked you to stop talking about it, yet all you do is try to bully us into it.""  Others took a similar view, including Ryan Price, co-founder of bitBrokers, Inc, who alleged that Robocoin was taking an aggressive move toward centralisation, one that “flies in the face of everything bitcoin stands for”.  Price alleged that Robocoin was seeking to profit from users' funds that would be kept in its banking platform, while exposing clients to additional risk and keeping their personal information outside their control.  He added:  “We will however continue to do off-ATM transactions in person for our customers until we arrive at some better solution.”  Robocoin countered that allegations the move would centralise its service amounted to “nonsense and fear mongering”, pointing out that operators of its platform had previously needed to interact with centralised services such as major bitcoin exchange provider Bitstamp, which its operators are required to use for liquidity.  Centralisation, not KYC  Although CoinDesk collected a wide collection of views on the issue, most operators who were protesting the change reported that their main concern was the company's move to its proprietary wallet platform, not its desire to have them collect information from customers pursuant to KYC regulations.  Pat Roberts, general manager of ABA Technology Pty Ltd, argued that coverage of the issue had so far incorrectly framed Robocoin operators as anti-regulation, owing in part to Robocoin's public statements.  ""Many of our concerns are not with the KYC changes, as your coverage or Jordan [Kelley] would suggest, but rather the closed wallet system they are enforcing for all transactions,"" he said.  Roberts indicated that his Robocoin machine running the version 1.0 software allows him to already optionally collect KYC information from customers.  ""Our company personally fully utilises all of Robocoin's KYC and has no issue with it now being compulsory,"" Roberts continued, ""however we and the vast majority have major issues with the new wallet system. We have been running two Robocoin machines since April until they were shut down yesterday. We have dealt with non-stop problems, software, hardware and support based. We would definitely have had less than 50% functional up time since their installations and probably closer to 30%.""  BitBrokers' Sheldrake echoed these concerns, suggesting that Robocoin was heading down a path similar to past bitcoin services that have folded due to security failures.  ""The problem is that once Robocoin accepts the bitcoin deposit it essentially goes into a 'closed' or private system that we have no control over or visibility into,"" he said. ""This is exactly what happened with Mt Gox.""  Others alleged that in its bid to offer retail bitcoin buyers instant access to bitcoin, it would require operators to be exposed to the currency's volatility, a charge the company sought to rebuff.  ""It should be considered a capital investment similar to the machine. Holding a float allows instant cash-to-bitcoin transactions, while mitigating many, many operational challenges,"" the company said.  Alternative software providers  Robocoin competitor General Bytes has been vocal in its criticism of the company – going as far as to set up a webpage to lure unhappy Robocoin customers with a ‘jailbreak’ hardware kit that will bolt onto their existing machine.  At least three operators have contacted the Czech ATM maker about its 'Robocoin fix kit' that includes a new computer and software for the ATM. A representative for the company said that new customers can simply unplug their old Robocoin computer, install server software and be operational within one business day.  However, it suggested that, as of today, its software only allows for bitcoin buying, and that added sell functionality and anti-money laundering (AML) upgrades won’t be available until January 2015. Both hardware versions retail for $500.  Robocoin has countered by suggesting that such quick-fix solutions may lead to liability risks for its former operators, provided these options issue private keys in a similar manner to its Robocoin 1.0 platform.  “All it’s going to take is for one scammer to claim that a machine didn’t print their private key and they’re going to have a lawsuit on their hands,” Russell said.  Voices of support  Although some operators have thus far proved resistant to the new policy, others told CoinDesk that they believe Robocoin’s decision to upgrade its wallet platform, while embracing regulation, makes sense from a long-term strategic perspective. Notably, this group saw the upgrade issue as one that was primarily about a small group of operators wishing the company not to comply with its legal directives.  National Bitcoin LLC CEO Patrick Hamilton struck a similar chord, even suggesting that his firm would purchase any unwanted machines from those who sought to get rid of their machines over the decision. Robocoin has said that it will provide logistical support to any operator that wishes to discontinue its relationship with the company.  “Bitcoin is not an anonymous technology and allowing criminals to use our systems to hide and transfer money for illegal drugs and terrorist activities is not something National Bitcoin can support,” Hamilton said.  Michael Smyers of Seattle-based ATM operator Coinme argued that the bitcoin industry must comply with regulatory directives if it is to survive long term, while calling for operators to put aside their differences for the good of bitcoin's long-term propigation:  “Our partners in this war for consumer influence are the regulators and Robocoin. You might not like the choices that Jordan has given you, you might not like the choices that the regulators have given you, but make the best of it, together, as a team.”  Image via CoinDesk",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/11/08/robocoin-policy-change-ignites-fears-over-centralisation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b7794c775b2c29094fa00170a7ab7a65732652c9-1500x869.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377773,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73X9l,1415460609,Can Hobbyist Bitcoin Miners Still Make a Buck?,"Is a perfect storm of rising difficulty and falling bitcoin prices killing home-based hobbyist mining? Some industry experts think so.  Ravi Iyengar, founder and CEO of CoinTerra, said that his company used to sell equal numbers of ASIC mining units to individual investors and institutional miners, who would buy them in larger volumes.  ""The ratio of small retail miners to institutional miners has gone down,"" said Iyengar, adding that now, fewer than 20% of the units CoinTerra sells go to people mining from home.  The downturn in sales to retail miners happened over the last five months, as the price dropped.  The cost of energy  There are various factors affecting the profitability of bitcoin mining. Hardware cost is one, while the price of bitcoins is another. The cost of electricity is also significant.ointera  Iyengar said:  ""At this point in time, home hobbyist mining doesn’t seem attractive because people aren’t getting the kind of electricity prices that big miners in low-cost locations are getting.""  The average US retail electricity cost was 10 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) in 2013, according to the US Chamber of Commerce Insitute for 21st Century Energy. At the current difficulty and bitcoin price, that means it would take around a year to break even using one of the used 1.6 TH/sec TerraMiner boxes that the firm is selling for $849 from its own mining data centres.  In Massachusetts, where the cost goes up to 14.5 cents/kWh, the break-even theoretically fails altogether. The exact figures will change over time, but the rise in costs is significant because units with high power consumption amplify even slight increases in electricity pricing.  What about a more state-of-the-art machine? KnCMiner's Neptune (currently out of stock) offers 3.5 TH/sec at just under 2 kW, for a hardware investment of $5,995. That seems to work out worse than the TerraMiner, at a 1.5 year ROI.  There are more efficient units coming onto the market, of course, but Adam McKenna, founder of mining pool Multipool, explained that home hobbyist miners are almost always behind the curve, putting cash down for a unit that won't ship for months, in a market where every day matters.  McKenna said:  ""By the time the home user's unit is delivered, difficulty might have increased by 20-30% or more"".  We ran numbers above on used TerraMiner ASICs, but CoinTerra is promoting a 16nm AIRE device that is far more cost effective, providing 4.5 TH/sec at 1.35 kW. That won't ship until Q1 next year, though, and the difficulty will have risen already by the time that anyone gets to mine with it.  Benefits for the big boys  Institutional miners have it easier, because they have access to far cheaper electricity.  ""The electricity bills at home are much more expensive than you’d pay in a data centre,"" said Emmanuel Abiodun, president and chief commercial officer at PeerNova. PeerNova sells its own mining racks and also owns CloudHashing, which provides mining contracts to individuals.  The average cost of electricity for US industrial users was around 7 cents per KWh this year, according to 451 Research. And data centers can position themselves in areas where electricity is far cheaper, such as in the Pacific Northwest, with access to hydroelectric and other cost-reducing energy technologies.  Data centres also have an advantage when it comes to securing mining equipment, explained Multipool's McKenna:  ""The main barrier to home miners is delivery date, since large buyers like cloud mining operations can typically negotiate to get their orders delivered sooner than someone buying one or two units.""  The use of some mining equipment can also be problematic. Modern ASIC miners sometimes require more power than can be drawn from a typical 15-amp home circuit, making them difficult to host in a home environment. This is a problem that data centres don't have.  [post-quote]  Data centres also have a capital advantage, not only because they can write down the cost of their equipment more easily, but because some of them can make their own equipment. One such business is CloudHashing.  Abiodun, who founded CloudHashing, has his own painful history here, having been let down by a major miner manufacturer when first starting out. After some negotiations with other ASIC vendors, CloudHashing ended up making its own chips.  Changes in bitcoin's price  With bitcoin prices so low at the moment, it's no wonder payback rates are so low. But if prices jumped to $1,000 again at today's difficulty, then things might improve. Our hypothetical TerraMiner might get our investment back in around seven weeks.  So, should home hobbyist miners continue to mine in the hope that prices will improve?  ""If you’re a small home miner and if you’re counting on the fact that bitcoin will go up, then you’ll be better off buying coins,"" said Iyengar.  If you're mining a coin because you're convinced that the price will rise, then spending $324 on a bitcoin today means that you're buying in at a fixed price and difficulty, and waiting for the market to work for you. But, if you use that money to mine, then you'll be paying for your bitcoin over time, battling rising difficulty in the interim.  What about altcoins?  The other option is to buy bitcoin-mining contracts from the very players who are selling the mining equipment in the first place, although then, you're buying hashrate at a slight premium. Could hobbyist miners switch to altcoins instead, for a better return?  Multipool offers many different cryptocurrency options, but McKenna offers a word of warning:  ""Low prices and very low difficulty on most SHA-256 alt chains, combined with profit-switching pools like Multipool, tend to keep altcoin profitability at or below bitcoin's. So it's not generally possible to mine most SHA-256 alts 24/7 and make more than you would mining bitcoin, unless you are speculating that the price of a particular altcoin will rise substantially in the future.""  What this seems to mean is that home hobbyist miners are doing it for love rather than financial gain at this point, at least until prices rise significantly, at which point they could turn on their ASIC boxes and have another stab at it.  Technology hobbyists often do things for love in many fields beyond bitcoin, though. This is what makes them so awesome. Just as long as they understand the economics and aren't being caught out.

42377778,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73XG3,1415455528,The Search for Satoshi,"One of the first places where Satoshi Nakamoto mentioned bitcoin was at the P2PFoundation.ning.com. When you register there, you have to give your birthdate. Satoshi gave April 5th 1975. There might, at first, seem nothing unusual about that.  It’s easy to look through history, find some event that took place on April 5th and then attach some kind of significance to it. Pharrell Williams was born that day – perhaps Satoshi was a Pharrell Williams fan and wanted him to sing the theme tune in the bitcoin movie, should there ever be one.  But, for those who study their money, April 5th was one of the most significant dates in history. On that day in 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 6102, which made it illegal for American citizens to own gold.  Roosevelt confiscated Americans’ gold, gave them dollars in exchange, then de-valued those dollars by 40%, pushing the gold price upwards from $20 to $35. He did this to devalue US debt as a means to deal with the Great Depression – but some say he effectively stole 40% of Americans’ money.  There are many who regard this action as one of the most unconstitutional things the US government has ever done. It was direct theft by government from the people with no democratic process.  While the American constitution clearly states that only gold and silver should be money, suddenly those who owned gold faced imprisonment of five to ten years if they did not hand theirs over to the government.  Perhaps this is too small of a straw to clutch. After all, Satoshi didn’t say he was born in the year 1933. He gave the year 1975.  He could have put 1933 as his birthdate – but that would mean he was an unlikely 75 when he designed bitcoin. 1975 made him a rather more believable 33 in 2008.  So what happened in 1975?  1975 was the year it became legal for American citizens to own gold again.  Such is Satoshi’s meticulousness and his knowledge of monetary history, I’m sure this is no coincidence.  By combining the two dates – April 5th and 1975 – he gives himself a credible age and manages a dig at what some regard as one of the US government’s most unconstitutional actions of the past century.  It’s an obscure but brilliant reference. It is also extremely political.  As we’ll see, Satoshi was not outspoken in his political beliefs. Then again, Satoshi Nakamoto was just a vehicle to design and develop a product. Judging by the Easter eggs he has left us, the man behind Satoshi, it seems, was rather more political than we realise.  How many people are there who have the knowledge of monetary history to make a reference like that?  Again, the answer is: not many. Particularly if you confine the search to Cypherpunks.
