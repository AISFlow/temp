42380027,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Ljaz,1510096614,"The DAO Again? Fears, Forks and Finger-Pointing In Parity Exploit Aftermath","In the wake of one of ethereum's largest-ever security exploits – if not the largest – the technology's community is showing signs of possible crisis.  After ""accidentally"" hitting a vulnerable patch of code, a developer froze the money in all Parity multi-signature wallets deployed after July 20. Users of these wallets can no longer use the ether, totaling at least $150 million dollars by some estimates.  But, the details are still fuzzy.  For now, perhaps the closest thing to an official estimate of how much funds were lost comes from a loose group of computer science researchers who found that at least $154 million was lost due to the bug. They were able to obtain the number by looking at the contract that created the mess, then scanning the ethereum blockchain for similar smart contracts, University College London research associate Patrick McCorry told CoinDesk.  In dollar terms, that's about three times the size of The DAO hack, an incident seen as perhaps the darkest event in ethereum's history.  Though the exploit doesn't affect ethereum as a whole, some in the community are worried the consequences will be far-reaching nonetheless.  Vulcanize engineer Rick Dudley told CoinDesk:  ""My thoughts are we should seriously consider as a community what the limit of our forgiveness is. At what point do we have to start ostracizing people for security failures?""  He went on to call this an ""existential risk"" for the smart contract platform.  Careless smart contracts  Still, ethereum developers are quick to point out that this is a problem with the smart contract code built on top of ethereum, not with ethereum itself.  ""It emphasizes what we already knew, that writing smart contracts is hard and that we’re still learning best practices and the chance to introduce bugs is still present,"" said FunFair founder and CEO Jez San Obe.  There's a danger to blockchain's ""unstoppable"" code. While this property might ultimately improve a range of applications – from tracking food supply to social media platforms – the bugs are unstoppable, too, as has been demonstrated in expensive bug after expensive bug in code running on top of the blockchain.  Ethereum developers and researchers have advanced ethereum's security on many fronts, with the goal of preventing events like The DAO from happening again. But perhaps the research is still too early stage to breed banking-grade security.  Others criticize the Parity team, since this vulnerability follows not long after another bug in their software, leading to a $30 million hack in July.  ""The situation certainly doesn’t inspire hope for their next update to patch this vulnerability,"" said Eximchain CEO and co-founder Hope Liu.  Despite claims to the contrary, Parity maintains that it did have the code audited before deploying it. ZK Labs audited some of Parity's code in October.  ""We follow very high standards in our development, [including] peer reviews. There is also a bug bounty program to incentives testing by the community,"" a Parity spokesperson told CoinDesk in an email.  Problem with ethereum?  Others disagree that it's a problem with the specific smart contract, however. Namely, the event gives ammo to long-standing critics of ethereum, who argue that the exploit demonstrates a fundamental problem with ethereum itself.  Litecoin creator Charlie Lee called ethereum a ""hacker's paradise"" in conversation with CoinDesk.  ""The Solidity language for writing ethereum contracts is one of the worst languages to use if you want to write bug-free code,"" said Lee.  A long-standing critic of the way ethereum is designed, he added that it shouldn't have been possible for the pseudonymous developer to touch other people's money by doing what he or she did.  ""[It's] all sorts of facepalm,"" he added.  Bitcoin Core contributor Johnson Lau called ethereum's smart contracts, ""dumb contracts,"" reflecting a view that the platform is not completely secure.  Others argue it's more of a question of moral hazard. After The DAO was hacked last year, ethereum developers executed a controversial change to return the funds to their rightful owners.  Others suspect that eventually, people will go to court over these sorts of exploits.  ""It seems inevitable that these highs stakes will lead to court cases and ultimately result in states holding blockchain software developers – of all types – to equivalent standards with private companies in the legacy financial system,"" said blockchain consultant Ciaran Murray.  Hard fork on the way?  So, is there a way to unfreeze these funds?  A so-called ""hard fork"" is one way to return funds to users. However, setting back the blockchain (and rewriting its distributed ledger) is a controversial method of making an upgrade. Last time ethereum developers executed one, the blockchain split into two competing networks. And, already, some users ""refuse"" to go along with such a change.  Localethereum published an informal Twitter poll asking ""Should ethereum fork again?"" with responses split roughly 50/50 so far.  Nonetheless, some think that a hard fork will be the likely recourse. Lau told CoinDesk that he ""expects"" ethereum will fix it with a hard fork.  ""I wish [Parity] the best of luck in their hard fork petition or whatever,"" Vulcanize's Dudley said. ""I really feel deeply sorry for the people who lost funds in this process, I hope none of them are killed over this.""  On the other hand, the company hasn't said what recourse they will take. ""It's too early to decide on solutions,"" Parity told CoinDesk.  Plus, others are still optimistic that ethereum developers will be able to find another workaround to rescue the funds.  Obe told CoinDesk:  ""It's too early to know if the expert white hat hackers will figure this out and find a short cut to repairing the damage and restoring the frozen funds. Don't write off these geniuses figuring out how to unfreeze [the funds].""

42380029,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LjdV,1510091135,UPS Eyes Paperless Shift With Blockchain Consortium Entry,"Global shipping giant UPS has joined a blockchain consortium focused on the trucking and shipping industry.  The aptly-named Blockchain in Trucking Alliance (BiTA) announced today that the firm will help develop standards around the tech's use for systems that track packages, facilitate payments between shipping parties and other applications within the industry.  In statements, Linda Weakland, UPS director of enterprise architecture and innovation, cited several possible use cases that UPS plans to explore through the consortium.  Weakland was quoted as saying:  ""The technology has the potential to increase transparency and efficiency among shippers, carriers, brokers, consumers, vendors and other supply chain stakeholders.""  Today's announcement struck a notably bullish note on the question of whether the technology will actually find its way into the firm's services. Developing standards around blockchain, UPS said, ""will support the logistics strategies that enable...customers to participate in global trade and finance.""  UPS is already looking into how blockchain can be used in its customs brokerage business, according to the release. The idea is that the technology could help UPS shift away from largely paper-based processes and toward a more efficient, shared platform that its customers and third-party associates can use.  The trucking consortium was originally created to help develop such standards, co-founder Craig Fuller said in a statement when the group was formed.

UFC Website Removes Malicious Crypto Code,"A subscription streaming site owned by mixed martial-arts powerhouse Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) is at the center of the latest controversy around clandestine, browser-based cryptocurrency mining.  Multiple users on social media reported yesterday that code developed by Coinhive – a monero mining script that can be embedded in a web page – was found in the code on the UFC's Fight Pass streaming site. It's unclear at this time where the code was sourced from, and a customer support staffer for UFC told a user that ""we take these matters very seriously, and will review this.""  “Immediately upon learning of the reported issue, Neulion, UFC’s over-the-top digital service provider, reviewed the UFC.TV/FIGHTPASS site code and did not find any reference to the mentioned Coinhive java script,"" A UFC spokesperson wrote in a statement to CoinDesk, subsequent to publication. ""We are continuing to review the available information and feel confident that there are no coding issues across the site at this time.”  But Reddit users contend they found lines of code for Coinhive's mining script in the HTML for the page, as shown in two different screengrabs shared to Imgur.  The software was also spotted running by several users, included one who later flagged it onon Twitter. After one reddit user emailed UFC support about it, he got a response saying that they were looking into it. The attention that the situation attracted appears to have spurred UFC to action, as the script was ultimately removed, according to another post.  None of the screencaptures on the Internet Archive from yesterday show the script in the source code on UFC.com, but the captures from yesterday were made after these reports started coming out.  The move represents the latest instance in which a well-known site played unwitting host to the Coinhive script, which utilizes a user's computer capacity to mine the privacy-oriented cryptocurrency monero.  Subsequent to publication, Coinhive emailed CoinDesk to say that since none of the screenshots included the site key, it couldn't give any information on how much had been mined or if it had happened. ""For what it's worth, we didn't notice any new 'top user' in our internal site wide dashboard. So the miner was either removed quickly again or didn't affect a lot of endusers,"" the company wrote in a statement. ""Just for the record, we have a strict policy against using our service on 'hacked' sites and will terminate accounts that violate our terms of service, as soon as we're notified of them.""  A streaming service run by Showtime previously found Coinhive code running on its sites, and web security firm Cloudflare has expressed its intent to crack down on sites that add mining software to sites without first notifying users.

The prototype, the firm announced today, is aimed at providing a more streamlined approach for captive or self-insurance policies. With this type of product, a company will essentially insure themselves and their subsidiaries versus a more traditional policy purchase. Per Allianz, the complexities involved in this process – which can cover multiple jurisdictions – make the strong case for a more distributed solution.  According to Allianz, Citi Treasury and Trade Solutions handled the payment process involved with the insurance. The prototype utilized the Hyperledger Fabric 1.0 software, which was published by the Linux Foundation-backed consortium of enterprises in July.  Hartmut Mai, a board member for AGCS, said in a statement:  ""We are currently seeing many blockchain applications in the financial services industry and we are eager to explore the potential of this exciting technology in the corporate insurance segment.""

Notably, CME Group last week announced plans to launch a bitcoin futures contract, aiming to have the product available by the end of the year. The product is still contingent on approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the firm indicated at the time.  Melamed told Reuters that he expects institutional investors to take part in the futures contracts, rather than just speculators, and called the move a ""very important step for bitcoin's history."" The product will enable investors to bet on bitcoin, as well as short-sell the cryptocurrency.  He went on to say:  ""We will regulate, make bitcoin not wild, nor wilder. We'll tame it into a regular type instrument of trade with rules.""  In the interview, Melamed explained he initially did not believe in bitcoin, but that his interest later grew.  ""I’m still that same guy who believes in, at least examining change,"" he explained.

The offspring from this was called Ethereum this may give us some clues to the future of tokenization. There could be two possible likely scenarios in the near future with the uncertainty in high profile cases that has now arising.1. The Reves test is applied and 99 percent of all initial coin offering are securities.2. Tokens are born without an ICO.First keep in mind the author is not a securities lawyer and is not giving legal advice or suggesting that all tokens are securities, I will leave that to those much wiser than myself. Reves vs. Ernest &YoungSo let's start by explaining the reeves test. Under the “family resemblance” test, one must start with the presumption that a note is a security which is rebutted if the note bears a resemblance to one of the enumerated categories on a judicially developed list of exceptions. If the “note” does not bear a resemblance to an item on the list, the analysis continues to determine if a new category should be added to the list.The following is :(i) The motivation of seller and buyer – The first factor is described as the motivation that prompts “a reasonable seller and buyer to enter into” the transaction. If the seller’s motivation is to raise money for his/her business and the buyer’s motivation is to earn profits, then the note is likely a security. Even if the note is not necessarily characteristic of a security, if the investor reasonably expected that they were buying a security, and would be protected by the accompanying securities laws, the courts can determine that indeed a security has been sold.(ii) The plan of distribution of the instrument – The second factor determines whether the instrument is being distributed for investment or speculation. If the note instrument is being offered and sold to a broad segment or the general public for investment purposes, it is a security.(iii) The reasonable expectations of the investing public – An instrument will be deemed a security where the reasonable expectation of the investing public is that the securities laws (and accompanying anti-fraud provisions) apply to the investment.(iv) The presence of alternative regulatory regime – The fourth and final factor is a determination whether another regulatory scheme “significantly reduces the risk of the instrument, thereby rendering the application of the Securities Act unnecessary.” The FDIC and ERISA laws are two such examples.Both before and after Reves, the issue of whether bank notes or CD’s are a security has been often litigated. In Marine Bank vs. Weaver, 455 U.S. 551 (1982), the U.S. Supreme Court held that a federally insured bank CD is not a security. In that case the court relied heavily on the fact that the bank was federally regulated and the subject CD was federally insured. The Court stated that CDs could be securities subject to the Act in other contexts and that instruments “must be analyzed and evaluated on the basis of the content of the instruments in question, the purposes intended to be served and the factual setting as a whole.”HypothesisIf the Reves test applies then a company could do a token offering as a security under Reg A+ or even file an S-1 for larger companies even already publicly traded ones. Under this scenario the company could birth a membership or redemption token with a stable value that could be exchanged for goods and services in the echo system. There is legal precedents that this type of thing is legal and and they were not considered a security.In 1972 S&H Greenstamps was brought before the Supreme Court for violating the unfairness doctrine. In FTC vs. Sperry & Hutchinson Trading Stamp Co.. companies could also birth protocol tokens to be initially purchased with the security token only by developers and strategies in order to build Dapps in the echo systems.

42380023,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LjXD,1510073743,Ethereum Client Bug Freezes User Funds as Fallout Remains Uncertain,"An unknown amount of user funds on the ethereum network have been frozen due to a code issue with the Parity wallet software.  The security vulnerability which activated the freeze was found yesterday in ethereum's second most popular client by a developer going by the name ""devopps199,"" who reported it on GitHub.  The vulnerability affects any Parity wallet deployed after July 20 that uses the company's ""multi-signature"" functionality. Under a multi-signature arrangement, more than one key is required to initiate and broadcast transactions.  So far, it's unclear how many of these wallets were deployed in that time frame and what amount of ether is currently stuck. According to data from EtherNodes.org, Parity constitutes roughly 20 percent of the network – and there's early indications that as much as $100 million worth of ether (if not more) may be inaccessible at this time.  This vulnerability follows another Parity issue from earlier this year, where wallets were hacked and $30 million in ether was stolen.  While the company patched that bug, another issue was still present in the code that allowed for today's exploit to happen. Speaking to CoinDesk, devopps said he is new to smart contracts and was following the logic of the former hack when he stumbled on the current problem.  What remains not as simple, however, is the process of figuring out how to retrieve the frozen funds.  Some developers have speculated that a hard fork is the only way to fix the problem. But as hard forks are a controversial upgrading mechanism – particularly in the context of ethereum - some in the community are already ""refusing"" to execute such an upgrade.  In the meantime, Parity has issued a statement warning users to avoid creating new multi-signature wallets, announcing:  ""We​ ​are​ ​advising​ ​users​ ​not​ ​to​ ​deploy​ ​any​ ​further​ ​multi-sig​ ​wallets​ ​until the​ ​issue​ ​has​ ​been​ ​resolved​, ​and​ ​to​ ​not​ ​send​ ​any​ ​ether​ ​to​ ​wallets​ ​that have​ ​been​ ​deployed​ ​and​ ​are​ ​in​ ​use​ ​already.​""  ""Parity Technologies would like to assure everyone that we are analyzing the situation, and we will release an update with further details shortly,"" the statement ends.

Speaking at the Kazan Tourism Forum 2017, Friday, Safonov said that the tourism industry is on the verge of transformation from new emerging technologies, blockchain in particular. In a report by Russian news agency Tass, he argued that the technology could be used to enhance the quality of services to tourists.  Safonov said:  ""We are absolutely convinced in our federal agency that blockchain will seriously change the tourism market, although, in our opinion, it will happen not in two years but in 5–10 years.""  Elaborating on the nature of the changes that blockchain might bring, the official explained that new technologies like blockchain will allow tourists to work directly with service providers, thus eliminating the need for intermediaries.  ""This makes the product better in quality, less expensive and also increases the provider's responsibility for the product,"" he added.  While cautious on cryptocurrency trading in the country, Russia looks favorably on blockchain technology more generally.  Last month, the government announced plans to test a blockchain-based land registry system early next year. Previously, Russia's deputy prime minister has spoken about the government's possible use of blockchain, saying the tech could see ""broad use"" in state administration.

At press time, the bitcoin-U.S. dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate is at $7,200 levels. BTC prices dropped to a four-day low below $6,950 yesterday before regaining poise, although the 5-day moving average (located above $7,200) is proving tough to crack.  So has the pullback run out of steam? Comments on social media indicate that, while some traders see the potential for a healthy correction to $6,500, others predict the market is likely to stay volatile ahead of the expected Segwit2x hard fork.  The odds seem high that the pullback has legs, given that the sell-off on Monday was backed by a 30 percent surge in volumes. A high-volume price drop usually means the investors sold in large quantities and is considered a negative indicator.  However, Google search volumes have declined over the last 18 hours, perhaps validating the argument that the retreat from the record highs is anything but ""panic selling."" Search volumes tend to go up during such events as investors scout for information.  Meanwhile, the price action analysis indicates bitcoin is likely to witness consolidation with downside bias over the next couple of days.  Bitcoin chart  The above chart shows:  Bearish doji reversal  Relative strength index (RSI) is still overbought  5-day MA is offering strong resistance  A confluence of 10-day MA and the trend line support at $6,868.  A bearish doji reversal occurs when a doji candle (one with a virtually equal open/close price) is followed by a negative price action on the following day. On the above chart, Sunday's doji candle was followed by a big red candle on Monday.  View  The doji reversal confirmation indicates the stellar rally in BTC may have run out of steam, and that prices could drop to $6,868 and $6,500 levels in the next couple of days.  However, dips below $6,868 are likely to be short-lived, given the 10-day MA still favors the bulls (slopes upwards).  On the higher side, only a sustained move above $7,500 would open doors for a rally towards $8,000.

Announced in 2016 as a way to invest in founders looking to decentralize the way banks do business, the fund suffered from a lack of the ""right combination of people"" to execute the fundraising, said 11:FS co-founder Simon Taylor, speaking at the firm's U.K. headquarters.  At the top of the list of difficulties was finding the right partner to warehouse the funds after they were raised.  Taylor said the company – which has a highly regarded team of co-founders including Taylor (the former vice president of entrepreneurial partnerships at Barclays), and executives David Brear (ex-Gartner) and Jason Bates (formerly with Starling Bank) – had ""zero difficulty"" raising the funds and would have closed the round if not for the warehousing difficulty.  Taylor positioned the decision as part of a larger pivot that finds the firm becoming a more traditional consultancy with a startup philosophy, telling CoinDesk:  ""The reality is, that fund has been mothballed. We loved the idea, we're committed to the idea, but sometimes you've got to pivot, and that's exactly what we've done.""  Taylor said that 11:FS walked away from an initial $5 million committed by Life.Sreda Venture Capital, effectively ending what would have been the fund's first partnership.  In spite of the change in plans, Taylor painted a picture of a young consultancy gaining traction among clients including banks, startups and financial infrastructure providers.  11:FS has grown from about 25 staff in April – at around the same time the blockchain fund was killed – to about 60 employees today, he said. In August, the former director of NTT Data Consulting's fintech practice, Sam Maule, came onboard as a managing partner and head of the startup's planned expansion into North America.  According to Taylor, 11:FS has expanded by generating revenue from its existing clients, although the firm is not sharing its revenue numbers.  At the core of the revamped company remains a focus on providing industry stakeholders consultation from those who have actually built competitive products. The group is also focusing on it media platform and research services.  ""We see ourselves as the challenger consultancy,"" said Taylor, adding:  ""We think that unless you change where your thinking comes from, the same-old thinking, equals the same-old vendors, equals the same-old outcomes.""  11:FS office image via Michael Del Castillo for CoinDesk",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Michael del Castillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2017/11/07/11fs-backs-off-50-million-blockchain-for-banking-fund,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d34c170fa25b999fde5baf5ccd3a76b1e7b8e353-1320x641.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

But Blockstack, a startup whose ""modest"" goal it is to create a new infrastructure for the entire internet, won't be offering a pre-sale for its new token set to go on sale Nov. 13.  Concerned that large buyers were scooping up most ICO tokens during prior pre-sales, Blockstack co-founder Ryan Shea told CoinDesk:  ""We think it's just really antithetical to what decentralization is about, so we considered that with the design of this entire process.""  Other industry observers have lamented on the pre-sale process, wondering how an ICO that making such an offering is any different than the traditional investment model that the new blockchain-based mechanism is trying to disrupt.  But skipping the insider phase isn't just about Blockstack getting to moralize on the state of ICOs – the company believes scrapping the pre-sale will have benefits for its business model.  ""For us, it's really important that we have a wide distribution of the tokens because we really believe that, if those users are to become stakeholders of the ecosystem, we want a very diverse representation of what the ecosystem is,"" said Blockstack co-founder Muneeb Ali.  Distribution focus  It isn't just that Blockstack wants a wide distribution; the company needs it.  If the startup's going to sell the internet on a new architecture, it has to deliver network effects quickly. According to Blockstack, people who hold tokens will have an incentive to use the system and maybe even build products for it, so the more token holders, the better.  In this initial token launch, Blockstack is distributing 440 million tokens to existing shareholders (like employees or investors) based on their equity and selling 440 million in the ICO to accredited investors only.  A third pool of 440 million tokens will be distributed to the existing Blockstack community (such as developers) through vouchers. The vouchers will be held in reserve until an undefined vesting period is over, Shea said, in an effort not to trigger SEC rules on selling securities.  After that, holders of the vouchers will be able to redeem vouchers for Blockstack tokens at the initial ICO price at a point when the company's counsel decides the tokens function as a commodity.  The voucher system gives existing Blockstack shareholders a sort of free call option, providing them the opportunity to buy the tokens in the future at a fixed price. So once vouchers activate, if the tokens are selling for $10 each, but they ICOed at 10 cents, voucher holders stand to make a 100x return on every token they exercise their option on.  According to Ali:  ""We deeply care about our open-source community and developers. So we spent a lot of time figuring out a legal framework where they could participate in this process.""  The mechanics of the system are broken down in a document released last week, which outlines how the price will be determined by the level of interest during pre-registration, which started Nov. 1. The Blockstack token will be the first sale managed by CoinList since it became an independent company.  The 1.32 billion tokens created during the initial release are not all the Blockstack tokens that will ever be created; more will be produced through mining when the Blockstack protocol goes live.  Venture privilege  But as pre-sales have benefits for startups, Blockstack's abandoning of the idea likely also has to do with its position as an already well-funded venture-backed company.  Blockstack's VC investors include Union Square Ventures, Lux Capital and Digital Currency Group, and those investors, according to the startup's founders, have yet to pressure the company to maximize monetary gains in the short term.  In this way, Blockstack being able to focus on using the ICO less as a cash-grab and more as a tool needed to interact with the platform is a kind of privilege not all projects get.  And eliminating the pre-sale isn't the only unique thing characteristic of Blockstack's ICO.  Unlike most token issuers, the firm isn't turning over management of its tokens to a non-profit organization.  Instead, earlier this year, Blockstack reorganized as a public benefit corporation (PBC), a legal identity that allows companies to make additional commitments to the public in addition to its fiduciary obligation to shareholders. To that end, the Blockstack PBC has committed to keeping its network decentralized and releasing its software as open source.  ""Because we can have a single entity, we don't need to create other non-profits in a different country and get into complicated situations, which you will notice is something other projects are still struggling with,"" Ali said.  With these deviations from ""normal"" ICO model, it wouldn't be a stretch to say that Blockstack's whole roadmap is a critique of the ICO market to date.  As Shea said:  ""We were disappointed in a lot of the previous sales, especially in the way they were run.""  Marc Hochstein contributed reporting.

According to the report, Ranjit further said that various cryptocurrency exchanges have approached the regulator and that, once the framework is outlined, the SC would then see which exchanges are registered.  The SC chairman also revealed that his agency is working on a pilot project to explore distributed ledger technology (DLT) for unlisted and OTC markets.  Planned to boost digital innovation in Malaysia's capital markets, Ranjit said the findings from the pilot would be published as an ""industry blueprint.""

42400624,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKCib,1510045230,How to Stop Worrying and Love the Fork,"Marc Hochstein is the managing editor of CoinDesk and the former editor-in-chief of financial industry publication American Banker.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to our subscribers.    November is going to be a nail-biter for bitcoin.      It's unclear whether the Segwit2x hard fork, expected to take place around Nov. 18, will leave us with one or two cryptocurrencies. And with more than $110 billion of value on the line, it's far from assured investors will come out ahead.      But let's take a deep breath, step back and appreciate the beauty of the situation. Because while in the short term hard forks can be stressful, they may be a blessing in disguise.      The reason is that forks potentially represent a welcome innovation in the way people can resolve their differences. Simply put, forks offer the possibility of exit. They give dissident minorities a third option beyond trying to change the majority's minds or adapting to their preferences. A fork is a bloodless, 21st-century form of secession.      This is hardly an original observation on my part.      In his recent essay entitled ""Blockchain Man,"" Taylor Pearson imagines a future where distributed computing leads to:      ""A society defined by forking. The balance between voice and exit will tilt towards exit. ... If you disagree with a decision, you can fork a new blockchain.""              It's a tantalizing thought. For now, though, the reality is messier.    True, bitcoin cash, bitcoin gold and ethereum classic are examples of forks where, despite some trolling between camps, the prevailing attitude was ""you do you.""  But the controversies over Segwit2x and its predecessors (Bitcoin XT, Classic and Unlimited) have had more of a zero-sum character, sometimes approaching tribal warfare.    Why can't one side just fork and let live? ""Nobody wants to admit they're 'the other guy',"" said Andrea O'Sullivan, technology policy program manager at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. ""They want to be the main guy.""      A charitable interpretation is that ""people are very emotionally attached to the concept of bitcoin,"" she said. ""They had their own idea of what it was and wanted to lay claim to Satoshi's vision.""      A less flattering explanation, not mutually exclusive with the first, is that this fight is ultimately about money.      ""You're talking about something rivalrous at the end of the day,"" O'Sullivan said.      Oddly enough, there's a case that enterprise blockchain (of all things) is where forking could really give individuals greater agency. For example, Preston Byrne, an independent consultant and founder of Tomram LLC, foresees a day when much of the work at law firms is automated, in part with open-source, standardized blockchain software.      In this world, a restless lawyer might realize that his employer's infrastructure is easily replicable with code from the public domain, and think, ""I can automate so much of this drudgery. Why not go fork off and do my own thing, and let the machines handle the back office?"" said Byrne.      Fork off and do your own thing. Now, that sounds like the American dream.

42400622,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKCef,1510030836,Money Manager VanEck Launches Cryptocurrency Price Indices,"The company behind a recent effort to launch a cryptocurrency-tied exchange-traded fund (ETF) has unveiled a suite of new price indices related to bitcoin and other digital assets.  New York-based VanEck announced today that it is partnering with UK data firm CryptoCompare to launch the indices, which include several that focus on specific cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether, as well as others that trace the movements of multiple assets. The indices are being managed through MV Index Solutions, a company owned by VanEck.  “Digital assets are a dynamic area that merits attention, especially by professional investor. Although not without risks, digital assets have the potential to integrate into the broad economy and become an investable asset class in their own right,"" Thomas Kettner, managing director for MVIS, said in a statement.  VanEck made headlines in August when filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission revealed a plan to list an ETF centered around bitcoin derivatives products. The filings – which came months after the SEC's rejection of an ETF effort launched by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss – ultimately came to form part of a wider effort to create similar products for U.S. investors.  In late September, however, VanEck filed to withdraw its application, revealing at the time that the SEC was all but refusing to review ETF proposals built around cryptocurrency derivatives, owing to the nascent state of that market.
