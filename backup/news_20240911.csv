33482880,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641195,1726096553,"Polygon Processes Over $214 Billion In DEX Volume As Adoption Explodes, Why Is POL Struggling?","Polygon, the Ethereum sidechain, recently upgraded, kickstarting their migration into a new era of scaling as highlighted by their Polygon 2.0 mission. Even though POL prices are still struggling, on-chain data points to a robust ecosystem that could support prices in the medium to long term. Over $214 Billion In DEX Volume Processed Via Polygon Aggregating data from DeFiLlama, an analytic platform, and the Aggegration Layer, a core hub for Polygon, the sidechain said it has deep liquidity and maintains a strong alignment with Ethereum. This alignment instills confidence in the platform’s interoperability, positioning Polygon as a preferred choice for developers launching dapps in a low-fee, scalable environment. Related Reading: Analyst Eyes 7% Dogecoin Jump—Will It Smash The $0.15 Barrier? Since the start of the year, Polygon has been growing rapidly. To put in the numbers, the platform has processed over $214 billion in decentralized exchange volume. At the same time, it has enabled the addition of $102 billion worth of assets through centralized exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and others. These impressive figures show that the platform is popular despite the availability of layer-2 alternatives, and it can also easily handle large-scale transactions securely. Besides the huge transaction count processed by Polygon, going by trends, it is highly likely that the Aggregation Layer, better known as the AggLayer, will boost liquidity and general utility. The AggLayer will be central to Polygon’s mission to scale Ethereum further while connecting all layer-2s technology built using its technology. In this design, the goal will be to ensure that POL has more utility while all layer-2s connecting access instant liquidity. Polygon Tech Finding Adoption: Why Is POL Down? With the upgrade from MATIC to POL on September 4, the new token means holders play a heavier role. For example, besides POL being used to reward validators who stake, it will be used to secure other platforms linked via the AggLayer. These added functionalities will help prop up bulls as the sidechain progresses in its goal of scaling. Related Reading: Bullish Signals Emerge For Ethereum: Price Rises Above Downward Trendline And Key MA Levels That Polygon is eager to scale without comprising security could explain the rising adoption levels. Recently, the Italian government issued a €25 million digital bond on Polygon PoS. Meanwhile, Franklin Templeton, Ondo, and Spiko all leverage Polygon technology as they tokenize United States Treasuries, according to RWA.xyz data. Even as impressive as Polygon has been growing, POL is still struggling. After the highly anticipated migration, the token edged lower, finding support at $0.35. Sows have the upper hand until there is a comprehensive close above the descending channel and $0.60.

33480895,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641243,1726092020,"Why Bitcoin Retesting $57,000 Is Good For The Price","Bitcoin (BTC) is finally making a comeback, with recent price spikes signaling a potential start of the long-awaited market bull run. As the cryptocurrency retests the $57,000 level, this renewed momentum could ignite a positive price rally, potentially driving more gains for Bitcoin. Bitcoin Retests New Levels At $57,000 On Tuesday, September 10, Santiment, a market intelligence platform, disclosed a new positive change in Bitcoin’s price movements. The platform revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin’s market value has experienced a notable uptick, skyrocketing to $57,600 this week. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Dogecoin Will Rise 3,600% To $3.7, Here’s When Notably, Bitcoin’s price surged more than 4.8% on Monday, September 8, marking a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency, which has been recording persistent price declines over the past few months. Earlier in August, the price of Bitcoin crashed below the $50,000 level, reflecting a decline of more than 20%. This massive price decline was triggered by various factors including large scale liquidations from the German government and the increased sell off fears and market uncertainty fueled by Mt.Gox’s Bitcoin distribution plan. As the market digested the price crash, Bitcoin fought its way back from previous lows to hit its current price above $56,000. Currently, the cryptocurrency is retesting new support levels around $57,000. A push above this price mark could potentially signal the onset of an even larger rally. Santiment has disclosed that Bitcoin’s recent price increase has come amidst short-selling activities ongoing on major crypto exchanges such as Binance and Bitmex since September 7. Based on the current market sentiment, the market intelligence platform suggests that the prevailing Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD) amongst investors in the crypto market could contribute to an even higher price surge for Bitcoin. This bullish sentiment is also shared by Michael van de Poppe, a popular crypto analyst, who has reported that Bitcoin is presently holding a price range between $58,000 and $56,000. Poppe indicated that the cryptocurrency is showing strong price fundamentals, while many altcoins are gaining momentum. The analyst expressed surprise that Bitcoin was able to invalidate his previous bearish set up to break above $56,000. As such, Poppe expects more positive inflows into the market if Bitcoin can have a retest above $55,000. He believes that if the cryptocurrency can break through this level, its price could surge to new levels between $60,000 to $61,000 in the coming weeks. Historical Patterns Suggests Imminent BTC Break Out A crypto analyst, identified as ‘Rekt Capital’ on X has made a bullish projection for Bitcoin, anticipating a major price breakout for the cryptocurrency soon. Historical patterns currently suggest that Bitcoin could potentially experience a significant price rally and push out of bearish trends in the next two weeks.

33478560,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641129,1726086639,Is Chainlink (LINK) $12 Breakout Imminent? Data Reveals A Rising Open Interest,"Chainlink is in a consolidation phase after weeks of volatility and selling pressure. The price currently holds above a support level of $10, a crucial liquidity level. The altcoin attracts the attention of analysts and investors who anticipate higher prices soon. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Surges Past $130 Resistance As Funding Rate Signals Bullish Momentum Data from Santiment reveals rising open interest, which signals sustained demand for Chainlink. As more traders and investors build positions, this increase in open interest suggests that a price rally could be on the horizon. This stabilization around the $10 mark has given some confidence to those who believe LINK may be poised for a breakout. Many analysts see this as a potential turning point for Chainlink, with its current price action reflecting growing optimism for future gains. If the consolidation holds and momentum builds, LINK could potentially push past its recent resistance and aim for higher levels. Chainlink Investors Showing Confidence Chainlink is testing key supply at its current levels, and top traders and investors are confident in a potential rise for LINK in the coming weeks. One significant indicator signaling strength is the rising Open Interest (OI), as revealed by Santiment. OI tracks the number of active contracts tied to a cryptocurrency, serving as a reflection of market engagement. When OI increases, it signals growing liquidity and interest in the market, while a decrease in OI typically points to reduced exposure. From a price analysis perspective, a rise in OI combined with a price dip often confirms a continuing downtrend. On the other hand, if OI decreases while the price rises, it may signal a bearish reversal. In Chainlink’s case, both OI and price are increasing, which suggests that the current uptrend could persist. As investors monitor the market, many are waiting for price confirmation above current levels to keep the momentum going and shift the overall negative sentiment that has clouded Chainlink in recent weeks. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Rally Brewing? On-Chain Metrics Suggest Investors Optimism LINK’s breakout could fuel a bullish run, as traders expect a more bullish trajectory in the short term. The rising OI serves as a strong indicator that market participants are increasingly confident in LINK’s potential for further gains. LINK Price Testing Supply At $10.8 Chainlink (LINK) is trading at $10.40 after testing local resistance at $10.83, positioning for a potential breakout toward higher prices. The price is struggling to clear the 4-hour 200 moving average (MA) at $10.71, a key indicator that has acted as a resistance since late August. For bulls to maintain momentum, LINK must reclaim the 4H 200 MA and target the next resistance at $12.70. Breaking past this level would signal a reversal and could lead to a more sustained uptrend, offering investors hope for further gains. However, if LINK fails to break through the 4H 200 MA, the altcoin will likely face a pullback, with support anticipated at lower demand levels around $9.30. A failure to hold this support could result in even lower prices, reinforcing the downside risk for traders.

We think brighter days lie ahead. Lower interest rates and a weakening dollar are expected to support BTC, with rate cuts likely boosting investor appetite for risk assets. The U.S. election could benefit BTC regardless of the winner, as both candidates appear more crypto-friendly than the current administration. Despite risks, BTC's resilience and potential catalysts like regulatory shifts and rate cuts lead us to initiate a BUY rating. Introduction Since its beginning, the year 2024 has been particularly agitated for cryptocurrencies, notably for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). In a short lap of time, several significant events occurred, such as the ETF approval on January 10th or the Halving on April 20th. Driven by these major triggers, BTC broke its all-time high and reached $73,794 on March 13th. From January 1st, 2024, to March 13th, 2024, BTC gained almost 75% before fluctuating since then. At the moment, we are writing this article, BTC is 24% below its all-time high. BTC Price Action Since its ATH (TradingView) The sentiment is rather pessimistic, as shown by the BTC Fear and Greed Index. Alternative.me You can see in the 1st chart that BTC faced important volatility this year due to various factors. The main factors we considered responsible for were, the selling pressure due to several important actors like: The Mt.Gox exchange paying back its clients. The German government, who sold 40 000 BTC. Miners who sold much BTC right after the halving. These moves were exacerbated by some movements from the U.S. government's wallets that could have added more selling pressure from a country that owns 2.7% of BTC global supply. After such turbulent times, we would like to share with you some potential catalysts that, we believe, could drive BTC prices upward for the remainder of the year and beyond. We will nuance our arguments by highlighting some risks, should we identify any. Short-Term Drawbacks of the Halving For Miners: Is It Over? The halving is a positive long-term event for BTC as it cuts miners' rewards in half, counteracting BTC inflation and increasing scarcity. As the halving date was programmed, everybody was waiting for the date of 20th April. Many thought that it would be the date representing the beginning of a stratospheric bull market. Many were ultimately disappointed. Indeed, in the short term, this event can also present some drawbacks and this has historically been the case. In reality, after a halving, miners need more computing power than they did pre-halving. Due to this, inefficient miners operating with outdated facilities and hardware face two choices: go bankrupt if they can't upgrade their facilities, or sell their BTC to fund hardware improvements. Below, you can have a look at the miner's reserve and see that this indicator reached an all-time low recently, with their reserve standing close to 1.81M BTC. Miners' BTC Reserve (CryptoQuant) On the other hand, the halving also triggered a decrease in the hash rate, which in our opinion indicates that inefficient miners were going bankrupt while others were upgrading their facilities. Meanwhile, the price dropped. Blockchain.com Then, after months of decline, the hash rate has now rebounded, reaching a new all-time high, which is particularly positive. We view this as a sign that inefficient miners have effectively left the market, while larger miners have strengthened. After months of work and upgrades on the miner's side, we don't expect more selling pressure from them for the upcoming months. There is another element that we would like to highlight. There is now a clear divergence between the BTC price and the hash rate, which are typically correlated. Historically, a rising hash rate has often signaled confidence in future BTC price increase potential. The current divergence suggests that miners continue to secure the network, anticipating potentially a rebound in BTC's value. This strengthens our view that the network's security remains robust, while miners are confident in the future, suggesting potential for BTC price appreciation at least for the short term and also over the long term as the hash rate continues to rise. Interest Rate Levels: The Size and The Number of Cuts Will Be Determining The interest rate level is crucial when it comes to demand for risky assets. Historically, risky asset performances have been negatively correlated to the level of interest rates, as lower interest rates fueled investors' appetite for risky investment and vice versa. As the economy cools, it seems only a matter of time before the FED begins cutting rates. Here are the market's rate expectations according to the CME Fed Watch tool: CME Group The market is currently expecting gradual rate cuts, with a terminal rate projected between 2.75% and 3.50% by September 2025. We maintain the view that a lower rate environment will be favorable for BTC and risk assets broadly, though the impact will largely depend on the scale of these cuts. Historically, the first-rate cut often coincides with market peaks, signaling that the Fed is stepping in to support an economy nearing recession. However, inflation has eased, and we're not yet in a recessionary phase. In a scenario where rates decrease and the macroeconomic landscape stabilizes without significant deterioration, we believe BTC has the potential to outperform. For now, market expectations point to a 70% probability of a rate cut between 0.25% and 0.50% at the upcoming FOMC meeting on September 18th. We view this meeting as critical, as the market will closely analyze the size of the cut and its broader implications. Finally, lower interest rates also impact the value of the dollar. As the value of the dollar decreases, investors tend to favor competing assets such as other currencies, gold and BTC. Decreasing interest rates means a weakening dollar, which will we think support BTC? It has been historically true, as shown by the negative correlation between the Dollar Index ( DXY ) and BTC: BTC, DXY Evolution (Grayscale, Bloomberg) Money Market: An Underestimated Cash Cow? Money market funds' total assets are positively correlated to the level of interest rates. In a high-interest-rate environment, investors tend to favor these funds as they offer better short-term yields compared to other investments. Since the Fed began raising interest rates in Q2 2022, the total assets in money market funds grew from $5.32 trillion to $6.5 trillion, representing a 23% increase in just over two years. The Money market funds evolution is impressive: FRED FRED With rates expected to decline, we anticipate that investors will gradually shift their capital toward higher-yielding asset classes, which inherently carry greater risk. We believe this trend will particularly benefit crypto assets and of course BTC. The U.S. Election: A Win-Win Situation More Than You Might Think The U.S. presidential elections will take place on November 5th. As we approach this crucial date, the only certainty is that it will be a very close race. We won't make any predictions on which candidate we think will win because it would be like tossing a coin. Look how close this is just by taking two different sources: On a recent national pooling published by Bernstein , Harris is expected to win with odds of 47% versus 44% for Trump. Bernstein On the platform Polymarket , Trump is the one expected to win, with odds of 53% versus 46% for Harris. Polymarket No matter the result of these elections, we believe that both candidates will have a more positive stance on crypto compared to the one endured during the Biden administration. As the industry grows and now that almost 20% of Americans own crypto , it has become a subject that can't be ignored. Since the beginning of his campaign, Trump made it clear that he wants the United States to play a major role in supporting BTC and innovation. As a symbol of his commitment, he also attended the Bitcoin conference in Nashville . Kamala Harris, due to her position in the Biden administration, has faced negative perceptions within the crypto community. This is largely due to the actions of figures like Elizabeth Warren and SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who have actively pushed for stricter regulations, slowing down crypto development in the U.S. Their combined efforts have contributed to a challenging environment for innovation, creating a cautious view of Kamala among crypto advocates, despite her not being directly involved in those decisions. We think that she is or has been forced to become more and more positive on crypto due to some pressure from its donors. This is suggested by a Bloomberg article shared on Yahoo Finance , which mentions: Major Democratic donors on Wall Street are increasingly pushing Kamala Harris' team to replace top regulators Lina Khan and Gary Gensler if the vice president wins in November. These changes if they were to happen would be positive for the crypto sphere and thus for BTC. We are convinced that more information will come out on this subject before the election. The more we move forward; the more we consider it a win in both cases, as both candidates start to understand the real potential of this industry that could be threatened in case of a too-restrictive regulation. Risks We do not deny the fact that some risks exist, there's a chance that Harris, if elected, could remain less pro-crypto than some expect, given her association with figures who have pushed stricter regulations. There is also a chance that Trump tried to surf on a wave he doesn't really understand and support just to raise money for his campaign. We might be naive, but in our analysis we made the assumptions that candidates were acting in good faith. Additionally, the potential recession risk cannot be ignored. If rates are cut too aggressively, it could reinforce investors recession fears, which may negatively impact market sentiment, including BTC. Conclusion We believe that despite the turbulence and uncertainty throughout 2024, Bitcoin has shown remarkable resilience. We have the conviction that key catalysts, such as the expected rate cuts and potential regulatory shifts after the U.S. elections, will help BTC to reclaim its momentum. We think the broader macro picture still leans in favor of Bitcoin. As the economic landscape stabilizes and rates come down, we expect capital to flow into higher-yielding assets like BTC. We see the potential for outperformance both in the short term and over the long term. At Growth Arcane, despite this tough 2024 year, we remain confident in BTC's outlook, and we initiate with a BUY Rating.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4720528-bitcoin-a-tough-year-so-far-but-brighter-days-on-the-horizon?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/33477899.jpeg

33476226,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641139,1726081201,Analysts Predict XRP ‘Mega Pump’ And ‘Perpetual Cycle’ – Details,"Crypto analysts have XRP under the lens, as the altcoin has been consolidating for over 500 days. Well-known XRP figure Edward Farina recently predicted that the coin will be on a “perpetual cycle.” Farina had this to say during the Istanbul Blockchain Week, with many believing XRP will enter into its biggest bull cycle despite the currently unstable market conditions. He has called on investors to enjoy the current situation while prices are low. Related Reading: Major Bitcoin Addresses See 5% Holding Boost – What’s Driving The Accumulation? Another crypto analyst, Egrag, shares his technical examination of XRP’s price movement in support of Farina’s optimism: The token’s recent resurgence within a key support and resistance levels, particularly $0.3931, signifies a very robust support zone. This particular movement of XRP has consolidated for over one and half years, which he thinks could be considered the accumulation that must be formed prior to a massive breakout. Egrag’s chart reveals that the bullish targets could be located at $0.739, $0.924, and may even be as high as $1.469. #XRP 540 Days Ranging Since March 13th, 2024! 🔥 If you’re getting shaken by these tiny moves, you don’t deserve the MASSIVE MEGA PUMPS that are coming!#XRPArmy STAY STEADY pic.twitter.com/ErNrvkO4F3 — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) September 7, 2024 ‘Mega Pump’ On The Horizon? From Egrag’s analysis, holders of XRP are about to get what he terms a “Mega Pump.” While he maintains that those who held onto their tokens during this quiet phase may be rewarded in big proportions, he put forth a contrary belief that individuals who sold their XRP don’t deserve the massive mega pumps ahead. While XRP remains in this range, other cryptocurrencies climb. Bitcoin peaked in June 2024; Binance Coin peaked this year in April 2024. Even meme currencies like Shiba Inu and FLOKI soared, although given the volatility of the crypto market these were not sustained for long. Despite the laggard performance, however, some long-term investors of XRP are pretty confident that the long accumulation phase will be followed by a breakout. ‘Perpetual Cycle’ Incoming? Farina’s strategy is dollar-cost averaging: a practice wherein investors gradually buy an asset, particularly when it’s down from the peak. He said it was an excellent candidate for long-term accumulation since XRP remains 80% below its $3.84 record price back in 2018. $XRP won’t experience a bull run, it will be a perpetual cycle. In a few years, we’ll look back at today’s prices, it will feel absolutely unbelievable. EAK TV interview at @IstanbulBlockWk #IBW2024 pic.twitter.com/wS30CFTAHI — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) September 8, 2024 Further, he noted that this may put investors in a position to reap extraordinary gains once the market eventually reverses upward. Farina is not in a vacuum with his optimism. Other analysts have mirrored his view, saying XRP could go up as much as $50, or even up to $100, in the not-so-distant future. Related Reading: BNB Weekly Active Addresses Surge Over 6% – Is A Rally On The Way? Will XRP Break Out? XRP is still affordable, trading around $0.527 at the time of writing. CoinMarketCap observers are bullish, with 73% predicting a token recovery soon. As varied as the market outlook was, many investors have followed Farina’s advice to accumulate XRP while prices remain low, hoping the token surges in the long run. Whether or not the “mega pump” occurs, the extended consolidation phase for XRP could be a preparatory move for something big.

42407690,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga0l2r,1726078367,Slowing Inflation Growth Points to More Upside in Crypto,"The case for Federal Reserve rate cuts keeps growing.  This week holds another important economic growth clue for policymakers at our central bank. On Wednesday morning, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (“BLS”) released consumer price index (“CPI”) figures for August.  The number is important because it’s one of the last key growth readings the Fed receives before its September 17-18 monetary policy meeting. The CPI gauge comes on the heels of last Wednesday’s weak Beige Book survey and Friday’s disappointing employment growth numbers. In other words, if inflation growth is weak enough, it could entice an increasingly dovish (inclined to lower rates) stance from our central bank.  This morning, annualized headline inflation growth fell to 2.5% for August, compared to the 2.9% rate in July. This marked the weakest result since the 2.6% increase in March 2021. That means the Fed is closing in on its 2% target. The change will support rate cuts moving forward. That will underpin steady economic growth and a long-term rally in bitcoin and ethereum.  But don’t take my word for it, let’s look at what the data’s telling us…  Each month, the Federal Reserve Banks of Dallas, Kansas City, New York, and Philadelphia, reach out to manufacturers in their regions to gauge levels of business. They ask about things like new orders, backlog, inventories, delivery times, and employment. Survey respondents say whether business has increased, decreased, or stayed the same. The data is then compiled into a composite index.  The results are important because the districts those central banks cover make up roughly 25% of national economic output. So, by gauging what’s going on there, we can get a sense of what’s happening across the country.  The number we care about the most is the “prices received” reading. It tells us what customers are willing to pay manufacturers for their finished goods. So, it’s akin to CPI. Yet these numbers are out before the BLS releases its monthly gauge.  So, by looking at the regional manufacturing data, we can get an idea of what inflation growth looks like before the official numbers are released. Based on what I see, prices eased in August…  As you’ll notice in the above chart, my proprietary inflation gauge (“CPRI”) began to roll over in October 2021. That was about eight months before CPI. And then, as you can see on the right side of the graph, CPRI has stabilized just above breakeven since July of last year. The change has led CPI to gradually move lower.  But it’s not just the lack of movement in prices received that has me convinced inflation’s still slowing. Look at this chart of gas prices…  According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”), the average retail price for a gallon of gasoline was $3.51 in August compared to $3.60 in July. That’s a drop of about 3%. More importantly, the price in August 2023 was $3.95. In other words, you and I are paying 11% less at the pump than we were a year ago.  Now look at how closely inflation follows retail gas prices…  The price of gas accounts for about 4% of the headline CPI number. It can be viewed as a gauge of economic activity because it’s something many people use on a daily basis. In other words, if demand is high, prices should jump, while fewer purchases should lead to lower prices.  The annualized change in gas prices for August is even larger than the 3% drop in July. When the July CPI result was released, inflation growth fell below 3% for the first time since 2021. That implies gas prices should be a bigger drag on the headline inflation numbers when the August result comes out.  Now, while core personal consumption expenditures (out later this month) is the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, CPI is still a driver of stock-market sentiment. Today’s result was in-line with Wall Street’s 2.5% expectation. The outcome supports the case for our central bank cutting rates, possibly by as much as 50 basis points.  The change will drive the value of our currency down, driving up the price of risk assets priced in dollar terms. That will support a steady long-term rally in crypto-based investments like bitcoin and ethereum.

33474702,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641303,1726077657,"Internet Computer Price Prediction: September October November 2024, GoodEgg Creates Digital Dating Crypto Platform","As we move through the latter half of 2024, the cryptocurrency market remains as volatile and dynamic as ever. Among the top contenders making headlines is Internet Computer (ICP), a project that aims to revolutionize the internet by decentralizing backend infrastructure. Alongside it, GoodEgg (GEGG), a rising star in the crypto world, is making waves with its innovative digital dating platform, positioning itself as a hybrid between Social-Fi and meme coins. This article will dive into the future predictions for Internet Computer (ICP) and highlight the unique developments surrounding GoodEgg (GEGG). September 2024: ICP Struggles Amidst Market Uncertainty The Internet Computer (ICP) has had a challenging year. Despite its innovative goals and potential to decentralize the web, ICP has seen a bearish trend throughout 2024. The current price of ICP is hovering around $7.28, a significant drop from its all-time high of $750.73 back in May 2021. Market analysis suggests that ICP is facing resistance at the $7.41 level and struggling to break out of its downward trajectory. However, not all is bleak Internet Computer (ICP). As developers continue to build on the platform and decentralized applications (dApps) grow in number, there is potential for a bullish turnaround. Analysts predict that if Internet Computer (ICP) can regain momentum and break through its resistance levels, it could see a price increase toward $9.03 by the end of 2024. GoodEgg (GEGG): An Emerging Contender in the Social-Fi Space While Internet Computer (ICP) faces challenges, GoodEgg (GEGG) is thriving. Currently in the final stages of its presale, with 80% of Stage 1 already completed, GoodEgg (GEGG) is building the world’s first AI-powered digital dating platform. This Social-Fi crypto project is unique in its approach, combining meme coin appeal with real-world utility by creating a platform that rewards users for social interactions and dating activities. The digital dating platform offered by GoodEgg (GEGG) allows users to earn tokens by participating in dating-related tasks, with the added appeal of unlocking exclusive NFTs and gaining access to higher levels of engagement. With a current price of $0.00015, early investors are jumping on the opportunity, seeing GoodEgg (GEGG) as a project with both short-term hype and long-term potential. October 2024: ICP Facing Resistance, GoodEgg Gaining Traction As we head into October, Internet Computer (ICP) is expected to continue battling against bearish market sentiment. The on-chain metrics for Internet Computer (ICP) show resistance at key levels, with support barely holding at $7.04. If ICP cannot push through the $7.41 resistance, analysts believe the token could dip further, potentially testing lower levels in the $6 range. Meanwhile, GoodEgg (GEGG)) is expected to gain more traction as its presale nears completion. The project’s digital dating platform is generating buzz in the crypto community, especially with its AI-driven features and social scoring system that rewards users for engaging in the platform. As more users join the ecosystem, GoodEgg (GEGG) could see a significant price increase in the coming months, attracting both retail and institutional investors. November 2024: ICP Forecast and GoodEgg’s Continued Rise By November, the outlook for Internet Computer (ICP) remains uncertain. Some analysts predict that ICP could experience a slight rebound if it manages to hold above its $7.04 support level and see increased adoption from developers. However, the overall market sentiment remains bearish for ICP, with a price recovery to $9.03 dependent on a significant shift in market conditions and investor confidence. In contrast, GoodEgg (GEGG) is expected to continue its upward trajectory. With 80% of its presale already completed and growing interest from the crypto community, GoodEgg (GEGG) is set to become a leader in the Social-Fi space. Its innovative digital dating platform, combined with its strong community-driven approach, makes GoodEgg (GEGG) a project to watch in the final quarter of 2024. In Essence A Tale of Two Cryptos While Internet Computer (ICP) faces ongoing challenges in the market, GoodEgg (GEGG) continues to grow as an innovative and exciting project. With the completion of its presale and the launch of its digital dating platform on the horizon, GoodEgg (GEGG) is well-positioned to dominate the Social-Fi space. Investors looking to diversify their portfolios may want to consider GoodEgg (GEGG) as a strong contender for future growth, while ICP remains a more uncertain investment, requiring a market shift to realize its full potential.

With Bitcoin’s recent recovery, the buzz around these two tokens has intensified, leading to speculation that their prices could soar. Whales are making significant moves, with one whale recently snapping up $50K worth of Popcat and another eyeing GoodEgg (GEGG), which is currently priced at $0.00015. GoodEgg (GEGG) – Gamifing Dating While Popcat (POPCAT) has been a dominant force, GoodEgg (GEGG) is emerging as a serious contender, offering something different with its Play-2-Date platform. As a meme coin that integrates A.I. and gamification, GoodEgg (GEGG) is attracting attention for its innovative features and growth potential. GoodEgg’s unique value proposition comes from its ability to combine meme culture with a practical use case, making it more than just another speculative token. The Play-2-Date platform allows users to earn rewards while interacting in a fun and engaging way, and the upcoming social scoring A.I. app has generated even more excitement. Priced at just $0.00015, GoodEgg is gaining traction among meme coin enthusiasts, with whales showing growing interest. How Popcat’s Recent Performance Affected it’s Price Movement Popcat (POPCAT) has been on a tear recently, surging by 3.2% in the last 24 hours and reaching $0.6216. This rapid growth came after the price found solid support at $0.4826, allowing buyers to push the token into a bullish momentum. Popcat’s rounding bottom pattern, combined with its strong performance above both the 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), confirms a robust upward trend. According to data from GeckoTerminal, Popcat’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is sitting at 66, approaching the overbought region of 70, indicating strong buying pressure. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is also in positive territory, signaling that the bulls are in control and pushing Popcat’s price upward. However, despite this momentum, a death cross has formed at $0.5617, a potential warning sign for the market. If conditions turn bearish, Popcat’s price could see a correction down to $0.5697, the 50-day SMA support level. Whale’s Fuelling Meme Rallying Speculation Whales, the deep-pocketed investors who can move markets, are getting in on the action. A whale recently purchased $50K worth of GoodEgg and Popcat, boosting the token’s trading volume and market cap. Meanwhile, other investors are turning their attention to GoodEgg, seeing it as the next big opportunity in the meme coin space. The combination of Bitcoin’s recovery, growing interest from whales, and the unique value propositions offered by GoodEgg and Popcat make both tokens attractive investments. However, GoodEgg’s integration of A.I. and social features sets it apart from the competition, positioning it as a potential market leader in the meme coin space. Last Thought As Popcat (POPCAT) and GoodEgg (GEGG) continue to rise, fueled by whale interest and Bitcoin’s recovery, both tokens are showing strong potential for significant gains. However, with GoodEgg’s innovative Play-2-Date platform and social scoring A.I. app, it could soon overshadow Popcat, offering investors a unique and exciting opportunity for growth. Whales are already filling their bags, and the market is watching closely as these meme coins battle it out for dominance.

While Internet Computer (ICP) continues to be a prominent player in the AI blockchain space, the emergence of GoodEgg (GEGG)—an innovative AI-driven Play-to-Date meme coin—has drawn significant attention and could signal a shift in investor preferences. Internet Computer (ICP): A Stalwart in the AI Crypto Space Internet Computer (ICP) has long been regarded as one of the most advanced blockchain projects, with a focus on decentralizing the internet. With a current market capitalization of $3.72 billion, Internet Computer (ICP) has maintained its position as the second-largest AI coin. The project recently saw a 5% increase in value over the last 24 hours, indicating strong interest from investors. This growth aligns with the broader trend in AI cryptocurrencies, where coins like NEAR Protocol and Render have also seen significant upward movement in the same time frame. The AI sector is heating up as more blockchain projects integrate artificial intelligence into their ecosystems. Internet Computer’s (ICP) cutting-edge technology allows developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) without relying on centralized cloud services, a major selling point in today’s market. Despite these advantages, Internet Computer (ICP) faces growing competition from emerging projects like GoodEgg (GEGG), which is blending AI innovation with a fun, meme-inspired twist that could challenge Internet Computer’s (ICP) dominance. GoodEgg (GEGG): The AI Play-to-Date Meme Coin making a difference Enter GoodEgg (GEGG), a new contender in the AI-driven crypto space. What sets GoodEgg (GEGG) apart from the competition is its unique combination of artificial intelligence and the social aspects of dating. With its “Play-to-Date” model, GoodEgg (GEGG) offers users a gamified dating experience, allowing them to earn rewards in the form of GEGG tokens as they engage in social interactions on the platform. This playful yet innovative approach is already capturing the imagination of investors. The presale for GoodEgg (GEGG) is seeing strong demand, with the AI-powered dating coin gaining traction in the crowded meme coin space. Its integration of AI allows for personalized matchmaking, enhancing user experience while providing real-world utility in the digital dating realm. The addition of AI to a meme coin adds credibility to GoodEgg (GEGG), allowing it to appeal to both the speculative meme coin community and the more utility-driven investors interested in artificial intelligence. By positioning itself as a hybrid between meme culture and technological innovation, GoodEgg (GEGG) offers something truly unique, giving it the potential to attract a broad audience. Why GoodEgg (GEGG) May Outperform ICP While Internet Computer (ICP) has a well-established presence in the AI blockchain world, GoodEgg (GEGG) is leveraging its innovative, fun, and rewarding ecosystem to position itself as a serious contender. Several factors contribute to the belief that GoodEgg (GEGG) could outperform Internet Computer (ICP) in the coming months: Engaging Use Case: The gamification of dating through a Play-to-Date model offers a fresh and engaging use case that attracts users and investors alike. Unlike Internet Computer’s (ICP) more technical applications, GoodEgg (GEGG) makes blockchain and AI accessible to everyday users looking for social interaction and entertainment. Meme Coin Appeal: The success of meme coins in recent years has shown that virality and community engagement can lead to massive gains. GoodEgg (GEGG) taps into this trend while adding utility through its AI-driven platform, making it an attractive option for those looking to capitalize on the meme coin hype. AI Integration: With artificial intelligence becoming a key focus in many industries, GoodEgg (GEGG) is well-positioned to benefit from the increasing demand for AI-driven solutions. By incorporating AI into its matchmaking process, GoodEgg (GEGG) adds a layer of sophistication that sets it apart from other meme coins and makes it more appealing to a wider range of investors. Strong Presale Momentum: GoodEgg (GEGG)has seen significant interest during its presale phase, signalling strong investor confidence in the project. With more than 80% of the presale completed, the momentum behind GoodEgg (GEGG) is undeniable. Delivering Entertainment and Utility The insurgence of GoodEgg (GEGG) highlights a growing trend in the crypto space: the fusion of AI and meme coins. Investors are increasingly looking for projects that offer both entertainment value and real-world utility, and GoodEgg (GEGG) delivers on both fronts. While Internet Computer (ICP) continues to perform well in the AI crypto market, its more serious approach may limit its appeal to mainstream investors, especially those drawn to the viral nature of meme coins. As GoodEgg (GEGG) continues to gain traction, it has the potential to redefine what it means to be a meme coin in the age of AI. With its innovative platform, strong community backing, and investor interest, GoodEgg (GEGG) is poised to become a major player in the AI and meme coin spaces. ICP Forges On as Playful Meme Gains Speed While Internet Computer (ICP) remains a dominant force in the AI crypto sector, the emergence of GoodEgg (GEGG) as a playful yet innovative AI-driven meme coin is shaking things up. GoodEgg (GEGG) offers a unique proposition with its Play-to-Date model, combining the best of both worlds—AI and meme coin culture. As more investors take note, GoodEgg (GEGG) could very well surpass Internet Computer (ICP) and other AI coins, making it a project to watch in 2024.

One of the latest disruptors in the space is GoodEgg (GEGG), a hybrid AI and Social-Fi project that is quickly gaining traction. With 80% of its Stage 1 presale completed, GoodEgg (GEGG) is setting its sights on dominating the AI crypto sphere, drawing attention away from major players like Internet Computer (ICP) and Decide AI (DCD). GoodEgg’s (GEGG) Emerging as a Dominant Force GoodEgg (GEGG) combines artificial intelligence with a unique social scoring system, creating a one-of-a-kind platform that rewards users for their social interactions. This innovative approach has attracted a diverse group of investors, including whales that traditionally favored projects like ICP. The rapid growth of GoodEgg (GEGG), currently priced at $0.00015, is proving that its appeal stretches far beyond the typical meme coin hype. The success of GoodEgg (GEGG) has been driven by its AI-powered social features and the platform’s focus on user engagement. With AI capabilities integrated into its system, GoodEgg (GEGG) provides users with a seamless experience that rewards them for their participation, setting it apart from traditional meme coins. ICP Whales Shift Focus to GoodEgg (GEGG) and Other Projects In a recent shake-up, Internet Computer (ICP) whales have started diversifying their portfolios by investing in GoodEgg (GEGG), as well as other rising stars like Decide AI (DCD) and Mpeppe (MPEPE). These whales, known for making long-term strategic investments, are increasingly drawn to GoodEgg’s innovative use of AI and blockchain technology. This shift in focus comes as ICP struggles to maintain its momentum. Despite its ambitious goal of decentralizing the internet, Internet Computer (ICP) has faced difficulties in reversing its downward price trend. According to recent analysis, Internet Computer (ICP) has seen resistance at the $7.41 level, with support lingering around $7.04. This ongoing bearish sentiment has caused some investors to seek alternatives, with GoodEgg (GEGG) emerging as a top choice. Investors choose Decide AI (DCD), GoodEgg (GEGG) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) for quick returns In addition to GoodEgg (GEGG), Internet Computer (ICP) whales have also turned their attention to Decide AI (DCD) and Mpeppe (MPEPE). Decide AI has made significant strides in the AI blockchain space, recently deploying OpenAI’s GPT-2 model on-chain using ICP technology. This breakthrough has solidified Decide AI’s position as a leader in decentralized AI, attracting the attention of deep-pocketed investors. Meanwhile, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has capitalized on its meme coin status, attracting both retail and whale investors. Its integration with GambleFi—a sector that merges blockchain technology with online gaming—has made it a favorite for those looking for quick returns. With its presale rapidly nearing completion, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has already sold 67% of its tokens and is positioned for substantial growth. GoodEgg (GEGG) Storming Ahead with 80% of Stage 1 sold While Decide AI (DCD) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) offer unique value propositions, it is GoodEgg (GEGG) that has captured the attention of investors looking for a combination of AI innovation and community engagement. As GoodEgg (GEGG) approaches the completion of its Stage 1 presale, the platform’s growth potential is becoming increasingly apparent. The platform’s AI-driven social scoring system allows users to earn rewards through interactions, making it a compelling option for investors who see the value in blending AI with real-world applications. With more than 80% of its presale tokens sold, GoodEgg (GEGG) is on track to deliver significant returns for early investors. Additionally, as Internet Computer (ICP) struggles with market challenges, more ICP whales are turning their attention to GoodEgg (GEGG). This shift signals that Internet Computer (ICP), while still relevant, may be facing increasing competition from innovative projects like GoodEgg. As a result, Internet Computer (ICP) investors are diversifying, seeing GoodEgg (GEGG) as a promising alternative in the AI crypto space. The Future of GoodEgg (GEGG) and the AI Crypto Space The growing interest from Internet Computer (ICP) whales and the broader crypto community signals that GoodEgg (GEGG) is well-positioned to challenge established AI and blockchain projects. As the platform continues to expand, it is likely to attract even more investors looking for a project that combines innovation, user engagement, and AI technology. For those looking to diversify their portfolios, GoodEgg (GEGG) offers a unique opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a rapidly growing project. With its innovative use of AI, strong community support, and the backing of major crypto investors, GoodEgg (GEGG) is poised to become a dominant force in the AI cryptocurrency space. As more whales and retail investors flock to GoodEgg (GEGG), the stage is set for the platform to disrupt the status quo and solidify its position as a leader in the AI-driven crypto world.

42407689,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga0l6A,1726077639,The Protocol: Polymarket Bets Pay Off as Memecoin Memorializes 'Dwebate',"In this week's issue of The Protocol, we've got the crypto angle on Tuesday's presidential debate – just as weird and ridiculous as you might imagine.  ALSO:  Ethereum Foundation's shrinking wallet.  Friend.Tech in low places.  Coinbase's Base relies on special formula to vault toward top of Ethereum layer-2 rankings. (Spoiler alert: It ain't the tech.)  Nearly $50 million of blockchain project fundraisings.  Tether, flush with cash, expands global empire.  Top picks from the past week's Protocol Village column: Livepeer, Polygon Labs, Tron, Tether, Snapshot Labs, Starknet, Fractal Bitcoin.  Network news  Polymarket bettors had an extra screen to keep an eye on during Tuesday's debate. (Sam Reynolds)  GREAT DWEBATE: It was entertaining enough to tune into Tuesday night's U.S. presidential debate between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. But it was nearly as rollicking just monitoring the action on prediction-betting site Polymarket and all the memecoins popping up on the token launchpad Pump.fun. Over the course of the debate, the Polymarket odds clearly drifted toward the conclusion that Harris was winning the tête-à-tête. ""Trump just getting destroyed,"" the crypto-friendly money manager and former Trump White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci wrote on X roughly 40 minutes into the face-off, attaching a Polymarket screenshot.  But there were also plenty of side bets at stake – and scads of memecoins launched including DWEBATE, DOMALA TRUMPIS, PEPEDENTIAL DEBATES and WW3, which sprung up to satirize the entire spectacle, or to document some of the more memorable zingers. (Many of the memecoin names were not remotely safe for a PG-rated blockchain tech newsletter.) Some Polymarket wagers paid off handsomely when Trump claimed – falsely, according to the Wall Street Journal – that migrants are ""eating the dogs"" in Springfield, Ohio. (That also sparked a few new memecoins, including EATING DOGS AND CATS.)  Anyone coming to the debate hungry for a crypto policy discussion went home hungry, for what it's worth: There wasn't a single mention of Bitcoin or digital assets. That didn't stop crypto twitterati from sounding off.  At least 12 memecoins named ""Run spot run"" sprung up on Pump.fun after a comment during Tuesday's debate by former President Donald Trump. (Pump.fun)  ALSO:  The Ethereum Foundation, the main non-profit organization supporting the Ethereum blockchain, is set to release an updated financial report “soon,” according to a top official who also revealed that the organization's main Ethereum wallet currently holds about $650 million. Justin Drake, a prominent researcher at the Ethereum Foundation (EF), wrote during a typed ask-me-anything – on an Ethereum subreddit under the handle ""bobthesponge1"" – that the EF spends roughly $100 million per year and currently has roughly a 10-year runway, depending on the price of ether (ETH), the blockchain’s native token. The last time the EF released insights on its financial holdings was in March 2022, at which point the EF treasury reported a balance of about $1.6 billion. That included $1.3 billion of ETH and about $11 million of ""other crypto.""  Friend.Tech, the Web3 social network that turned heads as a crypto sensation when it launched last year on Coinbase's Ethereum layer-2 network, Base, shared on Sept. 8 that it was transferring the ownership of its smart contracts to an Ethereum null address, permanently removing developers' control over them.  Coinbase Layer-2 Success Shows Power of Marketing Over Cutting-Edge Tech  A recent chart from on-chain data provider Token Terminal shows the network accelerating in recent months while other layer 2s were experiencing a dropoff. (Token Terminal)  Among the rapidly growing ranks of layer-2 blockchains built atop Ethereum, the U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase's own version, Base, hardly stands out as a technological pioneer. The entire project was built and launched last year using code borrowed from another team – Optimism, with its OP Stack framework for easily spinning up new layer-2 networks.  That's partly why it's so remarkable that Base has shot to the No. 2 spot on the key industry leaderboard L2Beat, with an 18% market share of 74 active layer-2 networks. Top-ranked Arbitrum's Arbitrum One dominates with a 40% share, but Base has shot past older, competing projects from teams with hard-fought reputations for cutting-edge development, including Starknet, Polygon, even Optimism itself.  But it turns out that the race for blockchain supremacy, just as in broader industry, is reliant to a large extent on marketing savvy and an ample warchest to spend on attracting new customers – not just whoever has the best tech. And Coinbase has helped to fuel Base's growth through its own advertising campaigns and promotional events, including the recently concluded ""Onchain Summer.""  The question now is whether the activity is sustainable. Are the accounts bona fide users with on-chain needs, or just a flurry of tire-kicking beta testers curious to try out the various protocols built atop Base? Are they opportunistic ""degen"" crypto traders taking advantage of one-time promotions and quests to collect extra riches, or racking up usage in hopes of eventually collecting tokens rewards?

The funding will support mobile app development, creator tools and user growth, according to the team.  An upcoming vape-to-earn project wants to use token incentives and blockchain-enabled vapes to make nicotine addictions additions go up in smoke. Called Puffpaw, the project intends to sell specialty vapes that record their user's smoking habits on the blockchain. It will reward them in their tokens for gradually reducing their nicotine intake. The quit-smoking project raised $6 million in seed funding led by Lemniscap Ventures.

The sale, scheduled for the week of Sept. 16, will be the first in the Solana blockchain ecosystem and will include 50,000 ""Hyperfuse nodes"" in 20 pricing tiers, according to the team. Proceeds will go into the project's treasury for general purposes, including supporting the development team and grants, CEO and co-founder Chris Zhu said in an interview.  Blockchain data provider Nansen said it bought staking platform StakeWithUs, as CEO Alex Svanevik looks to expand beyond data provision into offering investment services for institutions and retail traders.

According to the team, the project offered ""a more reliable and cost-effective solution than traditional cloud providers.  Polygon Labs, a major developer of Ethereum layer-2 networks, shared Tuesday it is unveiling a new type of computer chip that's optimized for zero-knowledge cryptography processing, built by hardware maker Fabric specifically for Polygon's interoperability solution, AggLayer. The team also shared that Polygon Labs will acquire $5 million worth of VPU-based server systems as part of today’s announcement, in order to accelerate ZK-proof generation projects on the AggLayer.  Tron, the blockchain founded by Justin Sun, is working with TRM Labs and USDT issuer Tether in a task force created to fight financial crime. The task force, the T3 Financial Crime Unit (T3 FCU), will combat illicit activity involving USDT, the largest stablecoin, on Tron. Sun said in a press release: “By collaborating with TRM Labs and Tether, TRON is helping to ensure that blockchain technology is used to make our world a better place, and sends a clear message that illicit activity is not welcome in our industry.”  Snapshot Labs, developer of anoff-chain voting platform used by 96% of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) including those overseeing leading DeFi projectsLido and Aave, is adding a blockchain-based option, built on the Ethereum layer-2 network Starknet.  Fractal Bitcoin, describing itself as ""the only Bitcoin native scaling solution that uses the Bitcoin Core code itself to recursively scale unlimited layers on top,"" launched its mainnet on Monday. According to the team: ""Using recursive virtualization of Bitcoin core software, Fractal scales Bitcoin's capacity infinitely while maintaining complete network consensus.

However, despite this upward movement, BNB is facing tough competition from a new player on the block: GoodEgg (GEGG), which is making waves in the AI social-finance sector. Binance Coin (BNB) Price Analysis: Rally and Resistance Binance Coin (BNB) has shown a commendable rally of 4.90% recently, bringing its price to $505. This surge is largely attributed to the bullish pattern forming in its chart, notably a double-bottom reversal within a broadening wedge pattern. This pattern indicates that Binance Coin (BNB) might be poised for a breakout, potentially reaching $600 if momentum continues. The positive sentiment around Binance Coin (BNB) is further bolstered by recent developments. Binance’s subsidiary, Tokocrypto, has secured the Physical Crypto Asset Trader (PFAK) license in Indonesia, a significant regulatory win that enhances Binance Coin’s (BNB) market position. Moreover, the imminent release of former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) on September 29, 2024, adds to the bullish outlook for BNB. GoodEgg (GEGG) Emerges as a New Contender Despite Binance Coin (BNB) recent rally, GoodEgg (GEGG) is emerging as a formidable competitor. GoodEgg (GEGG) is an AI-driven Social-Fi coin currently in presale, gaining significant attention due to its innovative approach in merging AI with social finance. GEGG’s unique proposition involves integrating AI technologies with social finance platforms to create a more interactive and rewarding user experience. The presale of GoodEgg (GEGG) has been met with enthusiasm, driving the price of GEGG closer to the $2 mark. This new AI meme coin’s rise is putting pressure on established cryptocurrencies like Binance Coin (BNB), highlighting the shifting dynamics in the crypto space. Investors are increasingly interested in GEGG’s potential to disrupt traditional social finance models and provide substantial returns. The Market Dynamics: BNB vs. GoodEgg (GEGG) While the recent price rally of Binance Coin (BNB) reflects a positive short-term trend, GoodEgg (GEGG) presents a longer-term threat to BNB’s dominance. The innovative nature of GEGG, combined with its successful presale phase, positions it as a significant contender in the AI social-finance arena. The price of Binance Coin (BNB) is currently testing crucial resistance levels, and its future movements will depend on whether it can sustain its bullish momentum and break through the $600 mark. Conversely, GoodEgg’s (GEGG) potential to hit $2 in its presale phase signals a growing interest in AI-driven financial solutions, which could lead to a reevaluation of Binance Coin (BNB) market position. Conclusion As Binance Coin (BNB) rallies and tests new price levels, GoodEgg (GEGG) is making a compelling case as a new and exciting entrant in the cryptocurrency market. The competition between Binance Coin (BNB) and GoodEgg (GEGG) highlights the dynamic nature of the crypto space, where innovation and new technologies continually reshape market trends.

33473837,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641106,1726075802,"Analyst Says Bitcoin Is In A ‘Healthier’ Place Now, Here’s Why","Bitcoin might be stuck in a downtrend, but fundamental analysis suggests it is in a healthy position. According to a recent analysis by crypto analyst Kaleo, Bitcoin is currently putting up healthier dynamics than it did in the previous halving cycle. This intriguing outlook for Bitcoin comes amidst the cryptocurrency’s struggle to stand firm above $54,000 and break above $57,000. Bitcoin Is In A Healthier Place Kaleo’s Bitcoin analysis, which was posted on social media platform X, compared the current BTC price performance since the recently concluded April 2024 halving to its performance after the previous halving in May 2020. It has already been 141 days since the last halving, but the BTC price has yet to perform up to expectations that many expected. Related Reading: Ethereum In 3 Months: Legendary Analyst Reveals Prediction For December The analyst highlighted that Bitcoin is currently trading 19% below its all-time high of $69,434 reached during the last market cycle. While some may interpret this underperformance as a sign of a prolonged bearish trend, Kaleo pointed out that Bitcoin is actually still holding up well. This is because, at the same time, after the 2020 halving, Bitcoin was already down 46% from the 2018 top. This historical context reiterates BTC’s stronger position today despite its current struggles to break above substantially. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $56,616. The lack of sustained bullish momentum since August has caused several crypto analysts to scale back their once-optimistic predictions. There have now been many negative and bearish predictions given the current market situation. However, Kaleo reminds us of a sentiment similar to that that dominated the market shortly after the 2020 halving. Back then, negative outlooks were prevalent. Many market participants expressed doubts and negative predictions about BTC’s future. Yet, Bitcoin bulls eventually defied these predictions, driving the cryptocurrency’s market cap above the $1 trillion level for the first time. This also triggered a significant rise in the value of many altcoins and the emergence of new sectors like NFTs. #Bitcoin / $BTC What if I told you Bitcoin is in a healthier place now than when it was at the same point post halving last cycle? It’s currently only down ~19% from last cycles top (141 days post halving). In 2020, it was down ~46% from the 2018 top 141 days post halving.… pic.twitter.com/tZ0mFey15I — K A L E O (@CryptoKaleo) September 9, 2024 What’s Next For BTC? Kaleo’s analysis suggests that despite the current pessimism, history might repeat itself, and Bitcoin will once again rise above market expectations. Furthermore, the analyst suggests the crypto ecosystem is now in a better place to support a stronger price surge. Institutional investors, for instance, are now able to efficiently invest in BTC through Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Regulatory clarity surrounding the crypto industry has also improved massively in the last four years. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Dogecoin Will Rise 3,600% To $3.7, Here’s When Another analyst, Rekt Capital, examined previous halving cycles and proposed that if history repeats itself, the next Bitcoin breakout could occur in October, which has historically been a strong month for Bitcoin. History also shows that the market peak could occur between 518 and 546 days after the April halving.

42407673,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga0kFG,1726072009,UK Introduces Bill to Clarify Crypto's Legal Status,"The bill introduces a new personal property category of ""thing"" that will apply to certain digital assets.  Once enacted, it will help the legal profession determine ownership in disputes such as divorce and provide protection to crypto owners subject to scams and fraud.  The U.K. government introduced a bill to Parliament touching on the legal status of digital assets including cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs).  The bill will clarify that these assets are considered personal property under British law. Once enacted, it will give the legal profession guidelines to follow when there's a dispute on ownership, such as during a divorce. It will also provide protection to crypto owners, whether individuals or companies, who are hit by fraud and scams.  Central to the proposal is a new category of property in addition to the existing ""things in possession,” which covers items such as money and cars, and “things in action,” such as debt and shares. The new category of “thing” will allow certain digital assets to attract personal property rights, Justice Minister Heidi Alexander said in a statement.  Earlier this year, the Law Commission, which reviews and recommends changes to laws in England and Wales, published a consultation on draft legislation to label crypto as property, followed by a report on its findings. Its conclusions apply to a subset of digital assets, according to the Ministry of Justice, mainly crypto tokens.  ""We conclude that some digital assets are neither things in possession nor things in action, but that nonetheless the law of England and Wales treats them as capable of being things to which personal property rights can relate,"" the Law Commission wrote in the report.",POSITIVE,없음,REGULATION,Sheldon Reback,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/09/11/uk-introduces-bill-to-clarify-cryptos-legal-status,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eebba543e500da9673e8e17a7669a1d23f1fa9bb-1177x662.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

33471618,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641279,1726070949,Bitcoin Tumbles Following Higher Than Anticipated US Core Inflation Data,"The higher-than-anticipated US core Consumer Price Index (CPI) reading was followed by a decline in Bitcoin (BTC) price as it tumbled almost 1.5% to $56,168 at press time. US Headline CPI Matches Forecast, Core CPI Exceeds It US headline CPI, the metric typically used to assess the inflation rate in the country, came in according to expectations at 0.2% month-over-month (MoM), and 2.5% year-over-year (YoY) for August 2024. However, core CPI (MoM) printed 0.3%, slightly higher than the 0.2% forecasted by economists. For the uninitiated, the difference between the headline CPI and core CPI is the constituents of the basket of items they assess. While the headline CPI measures all item categories, including housing, transportation, services, medical care, food, and energy, core CPI excludes food and energy prices to give a more stable view of underlying inflation trends. By removing the price of volatile items from its calculation, core CPI is often considered a more accurate indicator of long-term inflation. Following the unexpected core CPI print, BTC witnessed a quick decline in price as it fell from around $57,000 to $56,168 at the time of writing. The wider crypto market displayed similar trends as Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), Solana (SOL), and Ripple (XRP), which are down by 2.1%, 1.3%, 4.6%, and 2.4%, respectively. With the CPI data for August 2024 released, it seems all but certain that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will begin its rate-cut cycle with a 25 basis points (bps) cut in September. In a note, Capital Economics’ Paul Ashworth said: On balance, we still think the Fed will begin its rate cutting cycle with a more modest 25 bps cut. The 3.2% annual core CPI was mostly due to a 5.2% increase in shelter prices, while the three-month annualized core CPI rebounded only to 2.1% from a weak 1.6%. Related Reading: How Will The US Upcoming Fed Rate Cut Impact Bitcoin? QCP Analysts Weigh In Indeed, following the CPI data release, the probability of the Fed slashing rates by 25 bps next week has jumped to 83%, per data from CME FedWatch. Assuming the Fed reduces rates by 25 bps, it should instill some confidence in crypto and stock markets, fearing a 50 bps cut could signal the Fed not being fully confident in its ability to tackle inflation. What Lies Ahead For Bitcoin? As BTC remains loosely range-bound between $52,000 to $70,000 on the daily chart, analysts are speculating on the future trajectory the leading digital asset’s price could take. Some analysts opine that BTC’s current price action is reminiscent of a similar price consolidation in 2023. If the same scenario plays out in 2024, we could see a new Bitcoin all-time-high (ATH) price. It will also be interesting to see the impact of the US Presidential Elections scheduled to happen in November 2024. Interestingly enough, some election-agnostic analysts have stated that no matter who wins the election later this year, BTC is slated to win in the long term.

However, despite Quant’s impressive performance, a new player is capturing the attention of investors worldwide—Mpeppe (MPEPE). With its rapid rise in popularity and potential for massive gains, the question remains: can Quant keep up with Mpeppe’s explosive growth? Quant (QNT): Positioned for a Rally Quant (QNT), a London-based blockchain technology company focused on improving network interoperability, is making waves in the crypto space. Recent on-chain data and price action indicate that QNT could be poised for a rally. The token recently broke out of a falling wedge pattern, a classic bullish signal suggesting that a significant price increase could be on the horizon. Several factors support this bullish outlook for Quant (QNT), including: Rising open interest in QNT, signaling increasing trader activity. A negative spike in exchange balance, indicating fewer tokens on exchanges, which reduces selling pressure. An uptick in daily active addresses, showing more users are interacting with the token. A decrease in supply on exchanges, suggesting that holders are moving their assets to wallets, a sign of confidence in the token’s long-term value. At the time of writing, Quant (QNT)’s price hovers around $71, with analysts predicting further gains if it can break through key resistance levels. The token’s price volatility remains moderate, which provides stability and makes it an attractive option for cautious investors. However, with a booming new player like Mpeppe entering the scene, Quant (QNT) will need to continue outperforming if it hopes to match the rapid growth of its new rival. Mpeppe (MPEPE) – Climbing to The Top of Crypto While Quant (QNT) has garnered attention for its technical merits, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has taken the crypto world by storm with its rapid rise in value. The meme coin, known for its innovative approach to decentralized gambling, has seen an incredible surge in investor interest. With its low entry price and massive potential returns, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quickly becoming a favorite among retail investors looking for the next big opportunity. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s platform offers users a unique gambling experience powered by blockchain technology. Its innovative features, combined with the growing popularity of meme coins, have led to a 150% increase in its value in just a short period. This rapid growth has left many investors wondering if Mpeppe (MPEPE) could be the next Dogecoin or Shiba Inu. The token’s appeal lies in its community-driven approach and potential for high rewards. With a focus on decentralized gambling, Mpeppe (MPEPE) provides users with a platform where they can earn rewards while participating in various games and activities. As the platform continues to grow, more investors are flocking to Mpeppe (MPEPE), drawn by the promise of significant returns. Comparing Quant and Mpeppe: What’s the Better Bet? While both Quant (QNT) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) offer exciting opportunities, they cater to different types of investors. Quant (QNT) is a solid option for those looking for a stable, long-term investment backed by strong technical fundamentals and institutional support. Its focus on interoperability and network improvements makes it a key player in the blockchain space. On the other hand, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is a high-reward option that appeals to those looking for quick gains. Its meme coin status and innovative gambling platform give it the potential for explosive growth, but it also carries more volatility than a token like Quant (QNT). For investors seeking a balanced portfolio, a combination of both tokens could provide the best of both worlds. Quant (QNT) offers stability and long-term growth potential, while Mpeppe (MPEPE) provides the opportunity for massive short-term gains. What’s Next for Quant and Mpeppe? As the market continues to fluctuate, both Quant (QNT) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are positioned for success. Quant (QNT)’s bullish indicators suggest that the token could continue to rise, especially if it breaks through key resistance levels. Meanwhile, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s growing popularity and innovative platform make it a top contender for the next big meme coin. For investors looking to capitalize on the next market rally, both Quant (QNT) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) offer unique opportunities. Quant (QNT)’s strong technical foundation and on-chain data suggest that it has plenty of room to grow, while Mpeppe’s rapid rise and community-driven approach make it a token to watch in the coming months. Conclusion In a market filled with uncertainty, Quant (QNT) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) stand out as two of the most promising assets. Quant (QNT)’s focus on interoperability and network improvements positions it as a key player in the blockchain space, while Mpeppe’s innovative gambling platform and meme coin status give it the potential for explosive growth. For investors looking to diversify their portfolios, both tokens offer exciting opportunities. Whether you’re looking for long-term stability or short-term gains, Quant (QNT) and Mpeppe have the potential to deliver significant returns in the months to come. But with the market showing signs of recovery, now could be the perfect time to jump into Quant (QNT) and Mpeppe before their next big rally.

As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to face turbulence, both of these tokens have shown remarkable resilience, each for very different reasons. Let’s explore how Quant (QNT) and Mpeppe are navigating the current market conditions and why they’re gaining attention from savvy investors. Quant Defies the Market Downturn with Strong Fundamentals Quant (QNT) has proven itself to be a standout performer even as major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) experience price slumps. With a recent price surge of over 17% in just a week, Quant (QNT) has risen to a price of $71.04, marking a significant recovery from its recent lows. Notably, the token remains 48% below its 2024 peak, which means there could be room for further growth, especially with its strong underlying fundamentals. Quant (QNT)’s strength lies in its innovative approach to blockchain interoperability, which has garnered attention from major players in the financial sector, including institutions like the World Bank. The token’s bullish divergence, highlighted by increased on-chain activity and rising wallet addresses, signals a promising outlook even as the broader market remains bearish. Additionally, data from Coinglass shows that Quant (QNT)’s open interest in futures markets has surged to $13.91 million, the highest since June. This increase in open interest indicates renewed investor confidence, with more capital flowing into the token as traders anticipate further upward momentum. The combination of technical strength and growing institutional interest positions Quant (QNT) as a potential leader in the next phase of the market. Mpeppe Capitalizes on Innovation and Timing While Quant (QNT) thrives on strong fundamentals and institutional support, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is carving out its own path through innovation and strategic timing. As a new entrant in the market, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is a casino-themed token that taps into the growing demand for blockchain-based gambling platforms. What sets Mpeppe (MPEPE) apart is its ability to deliver exciting, engaging experiences in a decentralized ecosystem, making it a prime candidate for explosive growth. Despite the overall bearish market conditions, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has managed to capture the attention of investors looking for high-risk, high-reward opportunities. With its ICO phase still ongoing, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is attracting both retail investors and larger crypto whales who see potential in its gaming-centric platform. This token stands to benefit from the booming online gaming industry, which is expected to see further expansion as more users adopt decentralized, fair-play gaming experiences. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s value proposition is centered around transparency, security, and rewards, allowing users to participate in casino games and earn substantial returns. The token’s low entry price and innovative approach have led to growing interest, and its potential for significant price appreciation makes it an attractive option for those seeking early-stage opportunities in the crypto space. Navigating the Bearish Market: What Sets Quant and Mpeppe (MPEPE) Apart Both Quant (QNT) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) have managed to push forward in the face of market adversity, but their paths to success are distinct. For Quant (QNT), its success is built on years of solid development, strategic partnerships, and its role as a leader in blockchain interoperability. As the crypto space becomes more fragmented with numerous blockchains and networks, Quant (QNT)’s ability to connect these ecosystems securely and efficiently makes it a valuable asset for the future of decentralized finance. On the other hand, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is a relative newcomer, thriving on its ability to offer something different. By integrating the popular world of online gambling with decentralized technology, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is capturing a niche market that’s poised for growth. Its casino-centric platform offers both entertainment and the potential for high rewards, attracting a diverse range of investors eager to capitalize on the next big thing in crypto gaming. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Quant and Mpeppe? As the bearish market continues, both Quant (QNT) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) appear to be well-positioned for further success. For Quant, the next key resistance levels sit between $99 and $115, and if the token can break through these barriers, it could signal the start of a more sustained upward trend. The growing open interest in futures markets and increasing wallet activity suggest that Quant has the momentum to keep rising, even if the broader market remains sluggish. Meanwhile, Mpeppe’s ICO continues to gain traction, and as more investors discover the potential of its decentralized casino platform, the token’s value could skyrocket. With a focus on transparency, security, and engaging user experiences, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is likely to continue drawing in both retail investors and crypto whales looking for early-stage opportunities with high growth potential. Conclusion: Opportunities Abound in a Bearish Market In a market filled with uncertainty, Quant (QNT) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) offer two distinct but compelling paths forward. Quant (QNT)’s long-standing reputation as a leader in blockchain interoperability gives it the stability and institutional support needed to weather market downturns, while Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s innovative approach to crypto gambling makes it a standout option for those looking for the next big thing in the decentralized gaming world. For investors willing to navigate the risks of a bearish market, both Quant (QNT) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) offer unique opportunities for substantial returns. Whether you’re drawn to Quant (QNT)’s strong fundamentals or Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s explosive potential, these tokens are proving that even in tough market conditions, there are still plenty of opportunities for growth.

33471358,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641276,1726070423,Mpeppe’s Community Grows as Uniswap Holders Join The 1000x Presale $0.0021,"As the cryptocurrency market continues to present exciting opportunities, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is appearing as a top contender, attracting attention from major Uniswap (UNI) holders. With Mpeppe’s presale priced at $0.0021, investors are flocking to this promising project, enticed by its potential for massive gains. As Uniswap (UNI) holders diversify their portfolios, let’s explore why Mpeppe has become the latest sensation. Uniswap Defies Market Trends, Holds Strong Amid Bearish Sentiment Despite the broader market facing bearish pressure, Uniswap (UNI) has managed to defy the odds. The token recorded a significant 11% increase over the past seven days, signaling renewed investor confidence. Uniswap’s price has been supported by strong technical indicators, such as the Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the MACD. These positive signs suggest that Uniswap (UNI) may be on the verge of a breakout, with some analysts predicting an upside of 30%. However, while Uniswap (UNI) continues to hold its position as the largest decentralized exchange (DEX) token by market cap, it faces challenges with trading volume. In comparison to competitors like Curve DAO and PancakeSwap, Uniswap (UNI)’s volume has struggled due to fewer incentives in its liquidity pools. This has led some investors to look for more lucrative opportunities elsewhere—namely, Mpeppe. Mpeppe’s Explosive Growth: A New Favorite Among Uniswap Holders As Uniswap (UNI) holders seek diversification, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has become a popular choice for those aiming to capitalize on the next big project. With its presale currently in Stage 4 and priced at $0.0021, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has already raised an impressive $2.23 million, with 72.9% of the tokens sold. The excitement around Mpeppe (MPEPE) is palpable, and investors are eager to take advantage of the 20% bonus using the promo code MPEPE20. Why Are Investors Looking at Mpeppe? Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s appeal lies in its innovative approach to blending DeFi with gaming and gambling, creating a unique ecosystem that stands out in the crowded cryptocurrency market. Unlike other meme coins, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers real utility, making it a strong contender for long-term growth. Investors are particularly attracted to the potential for 1000x returns, making it a high-reward opportunity. The project’s success is not just limited to its presale numbers. Mpeppe (MPEPE) has built a strong community, with increasing numbers of Uniswap (UNI) holders joining the ranks, further fueling its growth. As the presale continues, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s rapid rise has cemented its place as one of the most promising tokens of 2024. Uniswap Price Analysis: Preparing for a Breakout Despite challenges with trading volume, Uniswap (UNI) remains a solid investment, with a market capitalization of $3.975 billion. The token has formed a symmetric triangle pattern, indicating a potential breakout. If Uniswap (UNI)manages to break through the upper resistance level of $9.550, it could reach new highs, offering attractive gains for long-term holders. However, investors should be cautious of a potential retracement. If Uniswap (UNI) fails to break out, the price could drop to the crucial support level of $5.725. For those concerned about this downside risk, diversifying into Mpeppe (MPEPE) may provide a hedge against market volatility. Conclusion: Uniswap and Mpeppe Are The Best Choice For Investors As Uniswap (UNI) continues to navigate market challenges, it remains a strong player in the decentralized exchange space. However, with Mpeppe (MPEPE) offering a unique opportunity for massive returns, investors are increasingly turning to this exciting presale. Whether you’re looking to capitalize on Uniswap (UNI)’s technical strength or Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s explosive growth potential, both tokens present compelling options for those seeking to navigate the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. With Mpeppe (MPEPE) already making waves and Uniswap (UNI) preparing for a breakout, now is the time to explore these two projects and position yourself for success in the dynamic world of crypto investments.

This led to huge gains in the altcoin market as the tokens rode the bullish wave. AAVE is one of the largest gainers this week with a whopping 20% uptick. Related Reading: BNB Weekly Active Addresses Surge Over 6% – Is A Rally On The Way? This is largely due to the return of bullish sentiment in the market and positive on-chain development which drove speculation for the token. With the upcoming release of the consumer price index (CPI) data today, an optimistic market awaits to jump on the bullish train. AAVE DAO Eyes New Asset To Deploy On-Chain Yesterday, September 10, Aave Chan Initiative (ACI) released a proposal to the AAVE community to include Coinbase’s cbBTC to Aave v3 on both the Base and the Ethereum Mainnet. According to the proposal, Coinbase’s entry into the wrapped Bitcoin market brings a “unique value proposition to the Aave ecosystem.” ACI also points out how users of Aave will benefit if the proposal passes. Another addition to the pool of assets Aave supports is better asset diversification for users, giving them solid and reliable options to put their money. Overall, the addition of cbBTC on Aave is viewed with much enthusiasm, however, some members of the community are hesitant with the current version of the proposal. Midapple expressed concerns about the proposals, specifically about the timing and implications the proposal has. cbBTC was announced almost a month ago with no details about the mechanism behind the coin. With Coinbase’s centralized nature, the community will have some difficulty protecting the network against possible problems of early adoption like low liquidity. In the case of Coinbase, which is a regulated entity in the United States, regulatory scrutiny will also affect cbBTC in the future and, by extension, the Aave network itself. As of writing, no further revisions have been made to the proposal. The Aave DAO just deployed a dedicated @ether_fi market on Aave. Users will now be able borrow stablecoins like $USDC, $pyUSD, and $FRAX against their @ether_fi weETH liquid staking tokens. pic.twitter.com/s3Met9veuU — Aave Labs (@aave) September 9, 2024 Another development on-chain is the deployment of a dedicated Ether.fi market on Aave, introducing liquid restaking on the platform. According to the thread, the new addition is a glimpse at Aave v4 which has new features like dedicated liquidity instances and risk isolation. Related Reading: Vitalik Buterin Withdraws 760 ETH As Market Turmoil Strikes Ethereum Possible Correction To Occur Around ~$150 The token’s astonishing drive upward has been due to the market recovery from the early September slump. Currently, AAVE is right between the $147-$157 trading range which might provide the bulls with a strong support level. However, the token’s bullish momentum is almost spent up, marked by the relative strength index (RSI) indicating that the bulls are somewhat exhausted. Investors and traders should monitor the token’s movement in the coming days as a correction might push the token below $147 before settling above the latter.

42407676,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga0kSU,1726069058,Are Ethereum Staking Yields Too High?,"Staking has grown in popularity in recent years due to the availability of staking-as-a-service, pooled staking, and the growth of liquid re-staking. As of July 2024, Ethereum's security budget amounts to a staggering $110 billion worth of ETH, representing roughly 28% of the total ETH supply. There is also a general adoption of staking features within exchanges and financial applications allowing people to allocate their ETH to secure the Ethereum network. Many view staking as a low-risk return on investment, which makes it appealing to ETH holders. Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, holds a portion of his ETH staked, although he still keeps a part of it unstaked.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  As staking grows in popularity through liquid staking derivatives, there is a need to better quantify staking returns for different platforms and how they change over time. One way to do this is using the Composite Ether Staking Rate (CESR) oracle feed which is a standardized on-chain Ethereum Staking Rate. This can act as a useful benchmark when considering trends in staking. It is crucial to better quantify trends in staking and consider their ramifications, while also pointing out the benefit of generating additional revenues for ETH holders.  Why Might We Consider Lowering ETH Issuance?  Although staking is essential to Ethereum's security, there are compelling arguments for reducing the ETH issuance rate.  Diminishing Returns on Security: Beyond a certain point, adding more validators contributes less to network security. The marginal benefit decreases while the costs — mainly through ETH issuance — continue to rise.  Increased Costs for Validators: As more staking occurs, the operational costs, such as hardware upkeep, also rise. These costs often trickle down to users, making the network more expensive to maintain.  Centralization Risks: With large entities or staking pools controlling significant portions of staked ETH, the risk of centralization increases. This could compromise the very decentralization that Ethereum seeks to preserve.  Dilution and Inflation: Excessive issuance of new ETH to reward validators leads to inflation, which dilutes the value of existing ETH holdings.  The Future of Staking  Staking, particularly through liquid re-staking, is rapidly evolving. As Ethereum continues to innovate, it will be important to better quantify trends in this corner of the market.

42407675,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga0kPB,1726069052,The Middleman’s Shadow in the Tokenization Complex,"In the world of crypto, digital assets, and the dream of decentralization, the middleman is a figure of scorn. We speak of peer-to-peer networks, of unmediated transactions flowing freely across borders, with no need for gatekeepers. Yet, whether we like it or not, intermediaries haunt every corner of this landscape. Some extract rent for their services; others simply maintain order in the chaos. But let’s be clear — whenever there’s a hiccup, a wallet vulnerability, or a glitch in a smart contract, someone must step in. And that someone, whether you call them a middleman or not, holds the keys to the updated and secure system.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Of course, as markets mature, the hope is that the role of these intermediaries becomes less overpowering. Bitcoin, Ethereum — these titans of decentralization — have grown vast networks, with developers who can troubleshoot problems out of a sense of duty or altruism. In this sense, scale may soften the blow of centralization, but the presence of intermediaries never truly vanishes. They are merely transformed.  As we venture into the tokenization of real-world assets the concept of intermediaries takes on new dimensions, and not just in technical terms but in the realm of regulation. Sandbox regimes are emerging across various jurisdictions, and they make one thing clear: Central Securities Depositories (CSDs) will not only persist but may become more central than ever before. Their larger, more globally connected counterparts, the International CSDs, are poised to take on an even more crucial role.  Brass tacks: some have dismissed these tokenization efforts as mere theater. After all, these tokens are not natively minted on a blockchain but are instead representations of assets still residing with the very intermediaries that Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) was supposed to render obsolete. It’s true that non-native tokenization hinders the full potential of the technology, limiting its ability to unlock the kind of streamlined, decentralized future many envision. These efforts, imperfect as they may be, offer an olive branch, a starting point that allows industry players to engage with DLT while keeping one foot in the world they know.  Some may rush to point out the redundancy of a CSD’s internal ledger, which must be reconciled against a blockchain that is theoretically already immutable and automatic by design. But this is a redundancy regulators are more than comfortable with.  Efficiency is not always the endgame here — stability and familiarity are. Complaints may fall on deaf ears. Instead, the challenge for industry participants is to show how tokenization, even within this framework of intermediaries, offers a path forward.  We see this path being forged today by behemoth asset managers, even as they grapple with the limitations of the blockchain technology they’ve chosen: limited scale, lack of interoperability, and a glaring absence of privacy. Either these obstacles no longer matter (spoiler: they do), or tokenization is managing to realize its potential despite them. The latter seems the more realistic conclusion, as it highlights the ways in which collateral access management and asset mobility are already providing tangible operational efficiencies in the real world.  Perhaps it is not about erasing the middleman but reshaping their role — refining the interplay between old-world institutions and new-world technology, until native tokenization finds its rightful place. In the meantime, blockchain-based financial market infrastructure is already a reality, though never entirely trustless. And that, ironically, is a reality you can take to the bank.

There's been a decoupling from gold, which has been making record highs, while bitcoin struggles more than 20% below its record level of a few months ago.  BTC's MVRV ratio is below its 365-day moving average which suggests a further price correction may be on the cards.  Investors in this current risk-averse environment appear to be favoring traditional safe-haven assets like gold as opposed to bitcoin {{BTC}}.  The correlation between bitcoin and gold has turned sizably negative of late, according to CryptoQuant, with gold recently pushing to new record highs above $2,500 per ounce while bitcoin has been declining and now sits more than 20% below its all-time high above $73,000 from March. The move into gold and out of bitcoin has come as U.S. stocks have struggled, with the S&P 500 slipping 3.6% since August 30.  CryptoQuant's Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator has been in BEAR phase since Aug. 27, when BTC was trading at $62,000.  The MVRV ratio (market-value-to-realized-value), has also been below its 365-day moving average since Aug. 26, which suggests a further price correction may be on the cards, said CryptoQuant. The MVRV ratio dipping below the moving average acted as a precursor to a 36% drop in May 2021.  The decline in bitcon's price has also come alongside a drop in the U.S. dollar index, another indicator of broader risk aversion and uncertainty, according to CryptoQuant.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Oliver Knight,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/11/bitcoin-decouples-from-gold-as-crypto-continues-in-bearish-phase,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8cfdc5159e3f88c8ba37b759aad8a5476f5f369d-1428x803.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
33469665,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641250,1726066852,ETH & BTC Price Prediction September: Top 2 Market Leaders Become Under Threat If This New AI Meme Hits $2,"The crypto market is currently witnessing a rebound, with Bitcoin (BTC) rising to nearly $57,000 and Ethereum (ETH)seeing a similar uptick. However, amidst these positive movements, both market leaders could be under threat from a rising contender: GoodEgg (GEGG). With its AI-driven, meme-based platform, GoodEgg has garnered significant attention, and if this emerging cryptocurrency hits the $2 mark, it could disrupt the dominance of BTC and ETH. Bitcoin and Ethereum Show Signs of Recovery After a challenging weekend where Bitcoin briefly dropped to $53,000, the market is showing signs of recovery. As of today, BTC is trading at around $56,820, with a 3.84% increase over the past 24 hours. However, Bitcoin remains in a sideways trading pattern that has persisted for six months, creating uncertainty among investors. The Fear & Greed Index stands at 34, reflecting a market still dominated by fear. Similarly, Ethereum has also made gains, climbing 2.35% to $2,345. Despite the short-term boost, ETH is still down by 6.8% over the past week, trailing behind Bitcoin in terms of overall performance. GoodEgg (GEGG): The AI Meme Coin Ready to Shake the Market While Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) remain the top cryptocurrencies, GoodEgg (GEGG) is positioning itself as a new contender in the AI and meme coin space. With its innovative AI-driven platform that blends social scoring and meme culture, GoodEgg (GEGG) is capturing the attention of investors looking for high-growth opportunities. The coin’s ability to merge artificial intelligence with cryptocurrency trading could make it a serious competitor to the established giants like BTC and ETH. Can GoodEgg Reach $2? The buzz surrounding GoodEgg (GEGG) has led to speculation about its potential value. If the coin hits the $2 mark, it could lead to a major shift in market sentiment. Such a surge would not only boost the coin’s market cap but also challenge the dominance of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Investors looking for alternatives to the traditional heavyweights might find GoodEgg (GEGG)’s unique proposition appealing, especially as it combines the viral appeal of meme coins with the advanced capabilities of AI. September: A Critical Month for Crypto Historically, September has been a weak month for cryptocurrencies. However, with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) showing signs of recovery, the coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether the market can break free from its sideways trading pattern. If GoodEgg continues to gain momentum, it could become a key player in the upcoming bull run, threatening the top two cryptocurrencies in the market. Final Thoughts: As Bitcoin and Ethereum work to regain their footing, GoodEgg (GEGG) is emerging as a serious contender. Its potential to hit $2 and disrupt the market could spell a new chapter for cryptocurrency investors. The coming weeks will be critical as GoodEgg continues to build its AI-driven platform, and investors will be watching closely to see if it can live up to its hype.

Popcat (POPCAT), a Solana-based meme coin, has been one of the biggest gainers in recent weeks, but a new contender has entered the scene. GoodEgg (GEGG), a Play-2-Date meme coin, is making waves and could soon outpace Popcat by a significant margin. Analysts are predicting that GoodEgg (GEGG) could surpass Popcat’s recent 18% rally and even achieve a 10X increase in value. GoodEgg (GEGG) Becomes Main Attraction While Popcat (POPCAT) is enjoying its moment, GoodEgg (GEGG) is poised to take center stage. GoodEgg is a new Play-2-Date meme coin that combines social interaction with cryptocurrency rewards, offering users a unique way to engage with each other while earning tokens. Currently priced at just $0.00015, GoodEgg (GEGG) is drawing significant attention from meme coin enthusiasts and investors alike. What sets GoodEgg (GEGG) apart from traditional meme coins like Popcat is its innovative Play-2-Date model, which allows users to interact in fun and playful ways while earning rewards whilst dating online. This combination of utility and entertainment is driving massive interest in the presale, with many predicting explosive growth for GEGG once it hits the broader market. Popcat’s Rally: Will Price Increase Demand Over the past 24 hours, Popcat (POPCAT) experienced a significant surge in price, climbing up to 18%. The token jumped from a low of $0.5418 to a high of $0.6419, eventually locking in 14% gains at the $0.62 range. This sudden rise was accompanied by a remarkable 92% increase in trading volume, with over $115.15 million worth of Popcat tokens being exchanged. The price boost brought Popcat’s market cap to $606.28 million for its 979.97 million circulating tokens. Despite these gains, Popcat (POPCAT) remains 38% below its all-time high of $0.9976, which it reached just two months ago. Why Popcat Took Off Several factors contributed to Popcat’s recent price rally. The resurgence of Bitcoin (BTC) to the $57,000 range created a ripple effect across the crypto market, benefiting altcoins and meme coins alike. As Bitcoin continues to set the tone for market sentiment, its impact on Solana-based tokens like Popcat and other memes like GoodEgg cannot be overlooked. Another key factor behind Popcat’s price increase was its recent listing on Binance Futures, which introduced USD-margined POPCAT perpetual contracts with up to 75x leverage. This listing boosted investor confidence in the token, further driving demand. Why GoodEgg Has an Edge On Popcat While Popcat (POPCAT) has seen strong growth, it lacks the utility that GoodEgg (GEGG) brings to the table. Popcat, based on a viral meme featuring the cat Oatmeal, has primarily gained value through speculation and its presence in the meme space. In contrast, GoodEgg (GEGG) offers more than just viral appeal; it has real-world utility with its Play-2-Date system, which enhances user engagement and creates a dynamic ecosystem for token holders. Analysts believe that GoodEgg (GEGG) is on track to outperform Popcat by a wide margin. With its low entry price of $0.00015 and the potential for a 10X increase, GEGG could soon dominate the meme coin market. Early investors in GoodEgg stand to benefit significantly from its unique approach, positioning the coin as a top contender in the cryptocurrency space. Popcat and GoodEgg: Taking The Market By Storm As Popcat (POPCAT) continues to ride the wave of its recent surge, investors are keeping a close eye on whether the token can maintain its upward trajectory. With resistance levels at $0.17050 and $0.18378, Popcat faces challenges ahead, but its listing on Binance Futures could provide the support needed to push the token higher. On the other hand, GoodEgg (GEGG) is gearing up for a massive launch, with expectations of significant gains once it hits the open market. Its combination of meme appeal, AI-driven interaction, and Play-2-Date features gives it an edge over more traditional meme coins like Popcat. GoodEgg – Next Best Thing? While Popcat (POPCAT) has captured attention with its impressive 18% rally, GoodEgg (GEGG) is emerging as the next big player in the meme coin arena. With a lower price point, innovative features, and strong community support, has the potential to outpace Popcat and deliver explosive gains to early investors. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, both tokens are worth watching, but GoodEgg (GEGG) may be the one to watch for those looking for the next big thing.

This pledge marks a significant shift in the market, as seasoned investors in traditional DeFi projects like Kaspa (KAS) are beginning to explore newer, more viral opportunities in the meme and AI-driven sectors. Kaspa (KAS): The Speed and Efficiency To New Heights Kaspa (KAS) has long been lauded for its speed and efficiency, distinguishing itself from other blockchain technologies by focusing on fast transaction processing. The token’s underlying technology, BlockDAG, allows for rapid block generation and seamless transaction throughput, making it a favorite among blockchain enthusiasts who prioritize performance over hype. While Kaspa (KAS) may not generate the same viral attention as meme coins, its steady performance improvements and technological advancements have attracted a loyal user base. However, even with these strengths, the emergence of meme and AI-powered coins like GoodEgg (GEGG) has begun to divert attention from DeFi tokens like Kaspa (KAS). GoodEgg (GEGG): The World’s First Play-2-Date Meme Coin GoodEgg (GEGG), the innovative Play-2-Date meme coin, is rapidly gaining traction due to its unique combination of viral meme appeal and AI-powered social scoring systems. Offering more than just hype, GoodEgg (GEGG) integrates artificial intelligence into its platform, creating an engaging ecosystem where users can interact, date, and play, all while earning rewards through the platform’s native token. As GoodEgg (GEGG)’s presale continues to gain momentum, analysts predict explosive growth at its official launch, with the potential for up to 200% gains. This makes it an attractive investment for crypto whales looking to diversify their portfolios and capitalize on the meme coin craze while still benefiting from technological innovation. Summary: The Revolutionary GoodEgg (GEGG) As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, investors are constantly seeking new opportunities that offer both innovation and substantial returns. While Kaspa (KAS) remains a reliable option for those who prioritize speed and efficiency in blockchain technology, the rise of GoodEgg (GEGG) represents a new frontier for meme coins and AI integration. With the recent pledge from a Kaspa (KAS) millionaire to invest 20% of their holdings into GoodEgg (GEGG), it’s clear that the market is beginning to shift towards more dynamic and engaging platforms. As GoodEgg (GEGG) continues to rally towards its 200% gains, it could very well overshadow traditional DeFi projects, becoming the next big thing in the crypto world.

With GoodEgg (GEGG) priced at just $0.00015 during its presale, it’s becoming a major competitor in the meme coin space. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL), long considered a key player in the altcoin market, is facing both challenges and opportunities with rising on-chain activity and a reduction in fees. Here’s how these two projects are shaping up as the year progresses. Solana (SOL) On-Chain Activity Sees Significant Growth Over the last 30 days, Solana (SOL) has shown promising signs of growth in its on-chain activity. Data from Dune Analytics reveals that the number of daily active addresses on the Solana (SOL) network has tripled, reaching 3.11 million users on Monday. This increase in active addresses is a positive signal, often associated with rising demand for Solana (SOL) and higher utility among traders. In addition, Solana (SOL) has seen a notable increase in new wallet addresses. In the first ten days of September alone, the network registered 22.88 million new addresses, which is more than half the number of new addresses created in the entire month of August. This spike in new users suggests that Solana (SOL) is being quickly adopted by new traders, adding to its growth potential. GoodEgg (GEGG) Attracts Whales with Social Scoring Innovation While Solana (SOL) is experiencing growth in its user base, GoodEgg (GEGG) is rapidly gaining momentum due to its innovative Play 2 Date platform, which incorporates a unique social scoring system. This feature allows users to earn rewards for social interactions, unlocking new levels and rare NFTs in a gamified experience. As more investors look for projects that combine social engagement with financial incentives, GoodEgg (GEGG) has become an attractive option, particularly for whales. With its presale price set at $0.00015 and over 2.4 billion tokens sold, GoodEgg (GEGG) is positioning itself as a strong competitor in the meme coin market. Investors who are looking to diversify their portfolios beyond traditional tokens like Solana (SOL) are drawn to GoodEgg (GEGG) because of its blend of entertainment and potential long-term financial growth. Solana (SOL)’s 68% Fee Reduction Provides Much Needed Momentum One of the key factors driving Solana (SOL)’s recent growth is the significant drop in transaction fees. The average transaction fee on the Solana (SOL) network has decreased by 68% over the past 30 days, now standing at $0.00520. This reduction in fees makes Solana (SOL) more appealing to traders and developers who are looking for an efficient and cost-effective blockchain platform. Lower fees, combined with an increase in daily active addresses and new wallet registrations, suggest that Solana (SOL) is regaining momentum. However, despite this positive on-chain activity, Solana (SOL) remains under pressure. At the time of writing, Solana (SOL) is trading at $133.83, down by less than 1% for the day, indicating that there is still some market uncertainty around its near-term performance. Why Solana (SOL) Resistance is Driving Investors to GoodEgg (GEGG) With Solana (SOL) showing signs of recovery but still facing resistance, many investors are exploring new opportunities in the meme coin market, and GoodEgg (GEGG) is quickly becoming a popular choice. The combination of its low presale price, innovative social scoring system, and growing community of investors makes GoodEgg (GEGG) an attractive investment for those looking to diversify. For Solana (SOL) investors who have traditionally focused on the utility of blockchain projects, GoodEgg (GEGG) offers a unique blend of utility and social engagement. As GoodEgg (GEGG) continues to attract whales and build momentum during its presale phase, it’s clear that this new meme coin is poised for significant growth in the coming months. GoodEgg (GEGG) Gaining Traction as Solana (SOL) Fights to Hold it’s Position Both Solana (SOL) and GoodEgg (GEGG) are positioning themselves as major players in their respective spaces. Solana (SOL) has the technical foundation and growing user base to continue its upward trajectory, but it will need to overcome market pressures and break through key resistance levels to reach its full potential. The recent reduction in fees and rise in active addresses are positive indicators, but the market will need more sustained buying pressure for Solana (SOL) to make a significant recovery. On the other hand, GoodEgg (GEGG) is rapidly gaining attention for its innovative approach to social engagement and cryptocurrency rewards. As more investors, including whales, flock to the project, GoodEgg (GEGG) is likely to see continued success in the meme coin market, especially as its presale progresses. A New Era for Solana (SOL) and GoodEgg (GEGG) While Solana (SOL) continues to grow its network and improve its transaction efficiency, it faces new competition from innovative projects like GoodEgg (GEGG). As both projects move forward, investors will need to weigh the benefits of Solana (SOL)’s strong technical foundation against the rising popularity of GoodEgg (GEGG), which offers a unique mix of fun and financial incentives. Whether Solana (SOL) can break through its current resistance levels and whether GoodEgg (GEGG) will continue to attract whale investors are key factors to watch in the coming months.

This AI-powered Social-Fi coin, which merges social engagement with financial rewards, is gaining traction as a top choice for investors who are diversifying their portfolios. While Solana (SOL) has also seen increased interest from whale investors, it appears that the innovation behind GoodEgg (GEGG) is drawing some of them to this new project, anticipating a massive 18,887% rally. Solana (SOL) Whale Activity and Price Rebound The price of Solana (SOL) has rebounded from key support levels, showing signs of a potential bullish trend. On-chain data reveals that whale investors have been actively accumulating Solana (SOL) over the past several months. Despite the broader bearish sentiment in the crypto market, Solana (SOL) has established a strong support base around $122, a level it has tested and rebounded from multiple times since the beginning of the year. In recent days, whale investors purchased 34,000 Solana (SOL) units, worth approximately $4.5 million, further boosting the demand for the token. This trend indicates that large investors have confidence in Solana (SOL)’s long-term prospects, particularly as the network continues to grow in areas such as DeFi and real-world asset tokenization. GoodEgg (GEGG): The New Favorite for Solana Whales While Solana (SOL) has been a favorite among whale investors, GoodEgg (GEGG) is now attracting significant attention. GoodEgg (GEGG) is an AI-driven Social-Fi platform that combines social interactions with cryptocurrency rewards.

42407683,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga0kfi,1726065037,The Harris-Trump Debate Showed How Little Crypto Matters to Voters and Politicians,"Presidential debates cover the issues that polling shows are most important – immigration, healthcare, the economy, climate change, and more. So why was crypto not mentioned even once?  Neither the American public nor the two presidential candidates care very much about crypto, and the debate showed that. Despite the industry narrative becoming increasingly partisan, many voters are looking past the simple fact that those outside the fishbowl simply don’t care; and it’s blinding those inside it to a simple fact.  For the most part, politicians tend to care more about remaining in office than anything else – regardless of party – hopefully, most rational people can likely at least agree on that. It takes a certain type of person, and ego, to want to hold elected office, and that type of individual is often reluctant to give up the stage once they ascend onto it. Biden’s long refusal to recuse himself from this election cycle is a prime example.  Deep pockets  In order to stay in office, politicians need donations.  Yes, Donald Trump did attend and speak at this year’s Bitcoin 2024 conference, in Nashville. He did make lofty promises, and he did spectacularly claim that “all Bitcoins should be made in the U.S.” But, guess what? That doesn’t mean it is actually a pressing concern.  His sole purpose for being there was a fundraising dinner in which he charged attendees as much as $844,600 per person for a literal seat at the table with him – the maximum campaign donation allowed under law. Other attendees paid $60,000 just for a picture with the former president. By comparison, a Kamala Harris’ San Francisco fundraising dinner not long after the Nashville event charged attendees anywhere from $3,300 to $50,000 to attend, and netted her $12 million.  If you think that’s a lot, just you wait. This industry has gone to incredible lengths to seek the relevance it craves.  Irrational exuberance  Since the Citizens United ruling in 2010, which paved the way for the creation for Super PACs (political action committees that take donations on behalf of candidates), only one industry has outspent crypto in terms of trying to garner influence in government, according to a recent analysis of campaign donations from the non-profit Public Citizen.  Since 2010, fossil fuel corporations have poured $176 million into political donations, including $73 million from Koch Industries – seen by many as the very symbol of dark money buying elections. This year alone, Koch has contributed nearly $30 million to the election cycle through two Super PACs, and no one else even in close – except for crypto.  The digital assets industry has donated a staggering $119 million into this election cycle, nearly half of all corporate donations in 2024, which total $248 million so far. This is roughly the same amount that the Senate Leadership Fund, a GOP-affiliated Super PAC that takes money from fossil fuel, tobacco, firearms, and for-profit prison corporations has received since 2014.  The next closest Super PAC to Fairshake, in terms of donations this year is the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity Action PAC, which has received $26 million in total.  To the moon … or not?  When you consider that corporate crypto donations have surpassed $129 million in the past three election cycles, amounting to 15% of all corporate donations since the Citizens United ruling, and that a staggering 92% of them have come this year, it’s no wonder politicians have all of a sudden started to speak to this audience.  Many in the crypto industry are firm advocates of community, narrative and meme-ability. To them, Trump is the perfect candidate. And they likely believe that throwing money at the right meme will take their concerns directly to the White House. To the political stratosphere. But, it won’t.  “The crypto ‘voting block’ is not voters but donors,” Nick Beauchamp, associate professor of political science at Northeastern University, when he spoke to the school newspaper. “Crypto appears on almost no one’s list of important issues, and most people are either unaware of it, or have rudimentary opinions.”  “However, there are a number of crypto-associated donors who care very much, and these people are the only reason that the campaigns are making crypto statements, and probably the only reason many Republicans and some Democrats like Chuck Schumer are resisting regulation,” he added.  Politicians see crypto as donors rather than voters – I hope some of you are seeing this.  Down the river  Many well-respected founders have greatly harmed their reputations this year through political ranting and raving aimed at rallying support for one candidate over another. Though it is their right to do so, one has to wonder how they’ll feel about their actions (and their consequences) years from now.  If any of the individuals in the space pledging to be “single-issue voters,” believing one candidate better supports blockchain and digital assets over the other, took a step away from social media for five minutes, inhaled a deep breath, and remembered who they were before falling down the Bitcoin Rabbit Hole, they might make a more rational choice over who to vote for – regardless of the candidate they pick.  No matter how much this industry tries to buy influence, it will not change a simple fact – crypto is growing, but its path to mainstream relevance still remains quite long and winding – and the debate has shown that once again.

33468821,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641103,1726065037,Polkadot Recovery Stalls As Bearish Pressure Returns With $3.5 In Sight,"Polkadot (DOT) is at a crossroads as its recent recovery attempt loses steam, with renewed bearish pressure pushing the price back toward the crucial $3.5 mark. After showing signs of a rebound, DOT’s momentum has quickly reversed, casting doubt on its ability to maintain higher levels. As bearish momentum resurfaces, the market is left wondering whether the bulls can mount a defense or will the bears drive the price even lower, setting the stage for further declines. With market sentiment hanging in the balance, all eyes are on DOT’s next move. This analysis aims to explore why Polkadot’s recovery has lost momentum and how renewed bearish pressure is steering the price toward the key $3.5 level. We will assess the technical signals and market conditions that could determine whether Polkadot finds support at this critical juncture or continues to slide lower. This insight will help gauge the likelihood of a rebound or further downside in the near term. DOT was trading at approximately $4.14 at the time of writing, reflecting a 2.49% decline. The cryptocurrency has a market capitalization of over $6 billion and a trading volume of $84 million. Meanwhile, over the past 24 hours, its market cap and trading volume have decreased by 2.47% and 11.83%, respectively. Technical Analysis: Is $3.5 The Next Critical Support? On the 4-hour chart, Polkadot exhibits strong bearish momentum as it continues to trade below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). The inability to break above this key moving average suggests that bearish pressure is redeveloping and that sellers are gaining control, which could lead to a further price decline toward the $3.5 mark. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour chart has recently dropped below 50%, now sitting around 45%. This decline indicates increasing bearish momentum and suggests that selling pressure is intensifying. Related Reading: Will Polkadot Accept This Major Request From A RWA Platform? DOT Down 65% Technical analysis on the 1-day chart also shows that Polkadot is making a bearish move toward the $3.5 support level, highlighted by the formation of a bearish candlestick. Additionally, the price is trading below the 100-day SMA, reinforcing the negative market sentiment and suggesting continued downward pressure. Finally, the RSI signal line on the 1-day chart is currently sitting at 41% as it continues to trend below the 50% threshold, which implies that Polkadot remains under pressure, with the potential for bears to regain control and push the price lower. Key Levels And Strategies For Polkadot As DOT faces a downtrend, the $3.5 mark stands out as a significant support level that could determine the future price movement of the cryptocurrency. If bearish momentum persists and the price falls below this support level, DOT could experience additional declines, potentially targeting the $1.9 support level and probably other key areas afterwards. Related Reading: Polkadot (DOT) Seen Reversing Losses With 116% Rally To $10 – Analyst Conversely, a rebound could occur if Polkadot holds above the critical support level, signaling a potential move toward the $4.8 resistance mark. Should DOT break above this level, it could continue rising to test the $6.2 level and potentially advance to explore other key resistance zones.

33467958,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641225,1726063244,Elon Musk’s Dogecoin Upward Trend But Can It Challenge New Gambling Predicted To 170x,"Dogecoin (DOGE) has seen a noticeable uptick in the past 24 hours, jumping by over 4%, thanks to increased whale activity and favorable market conditions. However, as Mpeppe (MPEPE) continues to win in the world of crypto gambling, investors are starting to wonder: Can Dogecoin (DOGE) keep pace with the innovative features and growth potential offered by the new gambling-focused token, Mpeppe (MPEPE)? With predictions that Mpeppe (MPEPE) could reach a massive 170x increase, the question remains: Is Dogecoin’s growth sustainable, or will newer tokens like Mpeppe (MPEPE) leave the famous meme coin in the dust? Dogecoin’s Recent Surge Over the past 24 hours, Dogecoin (DOGE) has risen by 4.92%, pushing its price to $0.10. In the past week, the token has also seen an increase of just over 4%, moving from $0.10 to its current price. Although still far from its all-time high of $0.73, Dogecoin (DOGE) is showing signs of a comeback. The recent surge in price can be attributed to Dogecoin’s trading volume climbing by 84% over the past week, combined with a slight increase in the circulating supply, now sitting at 145.88 billion coins. As a result, Dogecoin (DOGE) currently holds the #9 spot in market cap rankings with a total valuation of $14.91 billion. The Appeal of Dogecoin: Elon Musk and Community Backing One of the driving forces behind Dogecoin’s (DOGE) ongoing success is its association with billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk. Known for his outspoken support of the meme coin, Musk’s tweets and public endorsements often lead to price surges, as seen in this latest 4.92% increase. Dogecoin (DOGE)’s strong community and meme culture also make it stand out among cryptocurrencies. Despite lacking the advanced utility found in many new projects, Dogecoin (DOGE) remains a favorite for traders and investors alike, thanks to its large user base and high liquidity. Mpeppe’s Potential to Disrupt the Market While Dogecoin (DOGE) is continuing to attract attention, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is growing as a serious contender in the crypto space, especially in the realm of decentralized gambling. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s unique value proposition lies in its integration of blockchain-based gambling features that allow users to participate in a decentralized, fair, and transparent online casino experience. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s price currently stands at $0.0021, but with predictions that it could surge by up to 170x, investors are paying close attention. Unlike Dogecoin (DOGE), which gained fame as a meme coin, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers real-world applications through its gambling platform, making it an attractive choice for those looking for utility-driven tokens with high growth potential. Can Dogecoin Keep Up? While Dogecoin (DOGE) is riding high on its recent price gains, the question is whether it can maintain this momentum in the face of rising competition from tokens like Mpeppe (MPEPE). Dogecoin (DOGE)’s lack of unique utility beyond being a meme coin could make it vulnerable as more tokens with innovative applications enter the market. Mpeppe’s decentralized casino platform gives it a strong use case, one that could attract investors seeking more than just speculative gains. As more people begin to explore decentralized gambling, Mpeppe’s value could skyrocket, providing strong returns for early adopters. Dogecoin vs. Mpeppe: A Battle for Investor Attention In the world of cryptocurrency, both Dogecoin (DOGE) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are making waves, but for very different reasons. Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to benefit from its meme status, strong community, and high liquidity, while Mpeppe is gaining traction for its innovative use of blockchain technology in the online gambling industry. Dogecoin (DOGE)’s strong market position and recent price gains show that it’s not going away anytime soon, but the rise of utility-driven tokens like Mpeppe suggests that investors are beginning to look beyond meme coins for projects with real-world applications. Conclusion: The Future of Dogecoin and Mpeppe As Dogecoin (DOGE) rises over 4% in just 24 hours and continues to gain traction, it’s clear that the meme coin still has a place in the market. However, as new tokens like Mpeppe (MPEPE) enter the scene with innovative features and massive growth potential, the competition is heating up. The key question is whether Dogecoin (DOGE) can evolve and maintain its appeal in the long term or whether Mpeppe (MPEPE), with its 170x growth predictions, will attract the attention of investors looking for more than just a meme coin. For now, both tokens present exciting opportunities, but only time will tell which will come out on top.

33467961,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641232,1726063244,Quant Eyes $75 Whilst Whales Add New Gambling ICO To Their Holdings,"In the world of cryptocurrency, both established giants and emerging tokens are capturing the attention of investors. Recently, Quant (QNT) has shown signs of a strong bullish trend, while whales are eyeing new opportunities in the fast-growing gambling token Mpeppe (MPEPE). As Quant (QNT) positions itself for a rally, investors are strategically diversifying into Mpeppe (MPEPE), which promises significant returns. Quant’s Bullish Breakout Quant (QNT), a blockchain technology company focused on improving the interoperability of networks, has recently broken out of a falling wedge pattern—a signal for a potential bullish rally. This technical movement has drawn the interest of traders, with the token’s price rising by 2% on Monday to $70.5. The breakout indicates a possible rally towards the $85.2 resistance level, a 20% increase from its current position. Quant (QNT)’s on-chain data further supports this bullish outlook. According to Coinglass, open interest in QNT futures has seen a significant rise, indicating new capital flowing into the market. As more investors enter the market, Quant (QNT) is poised for a continued upward trend, with expectations of testing higher resistance levels. Whale Activity and Decreased Exchange Supply One of the key factors driving Quant (QNT)’s bullish momentum is the growing whale activity. The Exchange Flow Balance, which measures the movement of tokens in and out of exchange wallets, recently showed a negative spike, indicating that more Quant (QNT) tokens are leaving exchanges than entering. This drop in exchange supply suggests that investors are holding onto their QNT, reducing selling pressure and boosting confidence in a price rally. Additionally, the number of daily active addresses on Quant (QNT)’s blockchain has surged, from 531 to 2763 within just a few days. This significant rise points to increased blockchain usage and demand for Quant (QNT)’s services, further solidifying the bullish sentiment surrounding QNT. Mpeppe: The New ICO Whales Are Adding to Their Portfolios While Quant (QNT) is experiencing a bullish breakout, another token has captured the interest of large investors, Mpeppe (MPEPE). This new gambling ICO has been gaining momentum, particularly among whales looking for the next high-reward investment. Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a decentralized gambling platform that merges DeFi and gaming, creating a unique and attractive ecosystem for both casual users and serious investors. Whales have started to accumulate Mpeppe (MPEPE) tokens in anticipation of significant returns, especially as the gambling sector in crypto continues to expand. With predictions that Mpeppe (MPEPE) could experience a massive surge in value, similar to other successful meme coins, the token has already started making waves in the ICO space. Quant’s Rally Supported by Strong Market Indicators Aside from whale accumulation, Quant (QNT)’s rally is supported by several critical indicators. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Awesome Oscillator (AO) both indicate that the momentum is shifting towards the bulls. The RSI has surpassed its neutral level of 50, while the AO is on the verge of crossing the zero line, both of which are positive signs for continued upward price movement. Quant (QNT)’s on-chain data further reinforces the bullish sentiment. The exchange flow balance has shown a notable reduction in the number of QNT tokens on exchanges, dropping by 5.38% in a short period. This reduction in supply reflects increased investor confidence, as more tokens are being held in wallets rather than sold. What’s Next for Quant and Mpeppe? Quant (QNT)’s current bullish trend, supported by strong on-chain data and whale activity, suggests a potential rally towards $75 or even $85.2 in the near future. However, investors should keep an eye on the key support level at $67.4. Should QNT fall below this, the bullish outlook could be invalidated, and a drop to $56.8 could be possible. Meanwhile, Mpeppe (MPEPE) continues to attract attention as one of the most exciting new ICOs. The token’s unique approach to combining gambling and DeFi has positioned it as a strong contender in the meme coin space. As whales increase their holdings of Mpeppe (MPEPE), the token is set for potential exponential growth, making it a must-watch for investors looking for high-reward opportunities. Conclusion Both Quant (QNT) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are making headlines, with Quant (QNT) showing signs of a strong rally and Mpeppe (MPEPE) gaining traction among whales. While Quant (QNT) benefits from robust on-chain data and a bullish breakout, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers investors a chance to capitalize on the emerging gambling sector in crypto. As the market evolves, both tokens are set to provide unique opportunities for those looking to maximize their returns.

33467891,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641228,1726063231,DOGE vs MPEPE: Which Coin Provides More Opportunity For Its Holder To Make Massive Gains,"In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, two coins have been making waves: Dogecoin (DOGE), the original meme coin backed by Elon Musk, and Mpeppe (MPEPE), a new player in the decentralized gambling sector. With both tokens drawing attention for different reasons, crypto investors are left wondering—which coin offers more potential for massive gains? In this article, we dive into the strengths and weaknesses of DOGE and MPEPE, assessing their potential to deliver big returns to their holders. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Meme Coin King with Staying Power Dogecoin (DOGE) started as a joke, but it has evolved into one of the most recognized and traded cryptocurrencies in the market. Its appeal lies in its strong community, meme culture, and frequent endorsements from high-profile figures like Elon Musk. Recently, Dogecoin (DOGE) has seen significant whale activity. Large holders have been accumulating Dogecoin (DOGE) at a rapid pace. In the past week alone, over 708 million coins were scooped up by whales, contributing to a 9% surge in price following Musk’s cryptic “D.O.G.E” tweet on X (formerly Twitter). With a circulating supply of over 145 billion coins and a market cap ranking of #9, Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to be a major player. What sets Dogecoin apart? Its long-standing presence in the market and its undeniable cultural impact. Dogecoin (DOGE) has proven its ability to rebound after dips, thanks to its large community and strong social media presence. Additionally, the coin has seen steady growth in terms of both price and market sentiment, positioning it for further gains. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Rising Star in Decentralized Gambling While Dogecoin (DOGE) has built a legacy, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is the fresh new face in the cryptocurrency space, offering a completely different value proposition. Positioned as a decentralized casino platform, Mpeppe (MPEPE) aims to revolutionize online gambling by providing transparency and fairness through blockchain technology. With MPEPE currently priced at just $0.0021, the coin offers a low entry point with massive growth potential. Some analysts predict that Mpeppe (MPEPE) could see a 170x increase, especially as the decentralized gambling market continues to grow. The combination of a unique use case, a rapidly expanding ecosystem, and low competition in the niche gives MPEPE the potential for massive gains, especially for early investors. Opportunity for Gains: How Do They Compare? When comparing Dogecoin (DOGE) and MPEPE, it’s essential to assess their growth potential, current market positions, and utility. Dogecoin’s Strengths: Established Reputation: Dogecoin (DOGE) has been around for nearly a decade and has proven its staying power in the often-volatile crypto market. Whale Activity: With large holders accumulating billions of DOGE, the price could see a significant jump in the coming months, particularly if Elon Musk continues his vocal support. High Liquidity: As a top-10 cryptocurrency, Dogecoin (DOGE) is widely available across exchanges, making it easy for holders to trade and capitalize on short-term price movements. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Strengths: Low Entry Point: Mpeppe is still in its early stages, making it accessible to investors looking for high-risk, high-reward opportunities. Innovative Use Case: By tapping into the online gambling market, MPEPE brings real-world utility to its holders, offering more than just speculative value. Massive Growth Potential: With predictions of a 170x rise, Mpeppe (MPEPE) could deliver life-changing gains to early adopters if its decentralized casino platform takes off. The Risks: What to Watch Out For While both DOGE and MPEPE offer tremendous upside potential, it’s important to consider the risks associated with each. For Dogecoin: Volatility: DOGE’s price is highly influenced by social media hype, which can lead to rapid and unpredictable price swings. Limited Utility: Despite its popularity, DOGE lacks a clear utility beyond being a store of value and a means of tipping online. For Mpeppe: New and Unproven: MPEPE is still a relatively new coin, and its success largely depends on the adoption of its decentralized casino platform. Niche Market: While online gambling is a growing industry, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s niche focus may limit its mainstream appeal, potentially capping its growth. Which Coin Offers More Opportunity for Massive Gains? Ultimately, the decision between DOGE and MPEPE comes down to your risk tolerance and investment goals. If you’re looking for a relatively stable option with a long-standing track record, Dogecoin (DOGE) might be the better choice. It has already proven its ability to rebound after dips, and with whales increasing their holdings, DOGE could see double-digit gains in the near future. However, if you’re seeking a high-reward investment, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers significant upside potential. With a low entry point and a unique position in the decentralized gambling market, MPEPE could provide life-changing returns for those willing to take the plunge. Conclusion: The Battle Between DOGE and MPEPE Both Dogecoin (DOGE) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) have a lot to offer, but they cater to different types of investors. DOGE is the safer bet for those who prefer established cryptocurrencies with strong communities, while MPEPE offers a more speculative play with the potential for massive gains in a relatively untapped market. As always, it’s essential to do your research and consider your investment goals before diving into the world of cryptocurrency. Whether you choose DOGE or MPEPE, both coins provide unique opportunities for profit in this rapidly evolving market.

33467888,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641230,1726063222,"SHIB Bulls Are Making The Move On Mpeppe As Its Skyrockets 150%, Can Shiba Inu (SHIB) Keep up?","The meme coin arena is witnessing a dramatic shift as investors from Shiba Inu (SHIB) (SHIB) start diverting their attention to Mpeppe (MPEPE), an expanding star in the crypto world. With Mpeppe (MPEPE) skyrocketing 150%, the question arises: can Shiba Inu (SHIB) keep up with the pace? Let’s explore how this new competitor is shaking things up and what it means for the SHIB bulls. Mpeppe – What’s Driving The 150% Surge? Mpeppe (MPEPE), a meme coin with a twist, has become the talk of the crypto community with its massive 150% surge in recent days. Known for its integration into the online gambling world, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has attracted attention with a unique proposition—leveraging blockchain technology to revolutionize decentralized gambling. Unlike traditional meme coins that thrive purely on community hype, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is offering real-world value through its gambling platform, bringing in players and investors alike. This has allowed MPEPE to distinguish itself from the crowd and gain traction in an otherwise saturated market. The combination of speculation-driven buying and its expanding utility has led to Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s explosive growth. Investors, particularly those from the Shiba Inu (SHIB) camp, are starting to shift their focus, seeking better returns in this emerging project. SHIB Bulls: Why Are They Making A Move On Mpeppe? Shiba Inu (SHIB) has always been a favorite among retail investors, especially during its initial hype phase. However, recent months have seen SHIB facing challenges as it struggles to break through key resistance levels. Despite having strong community support, SHIB has been in consolidation mode, leaving some investors looking for more immediate gains elsewhere. With Mpeppe’s (MPEPE) rapid price surge, it’s no surprise that many SHIB bulls are looking to capitalize on the rising trend. Mpeppe (MPEPE) has captured attention not only for its price performance but also for its promise of future growth in the decentralized gambling sector. For investors looking for short-term profits, MPEPE presents a lucrative opportunity. At the same time, many SHIB holders still believe in the long-term potential of Shiba Inu (SHIB), particularly with its ongoing ecosystem developments. However, the allure of Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s rapid growth has proven too tempting for some. Shiba Inu (SHIB)’s Challenges: Can SHIB Keep Pace? While Mpeppe (MPEPE) continues its meteoric rise, Shiba Inu (SHIB) finds itself at a critical juncture. The SHIB bulls are pushing to break through resistance levels around $0.0000169734, where the 50-Daily-EMA looms as a major hurdle. If SHIB can surpass this level, it could ignite a new rally that repositions Shiba Inu (SHIB) back in the spotlight. However, the path forward for Shiba Inu (SHIB) isn’t without its challenges. SHIB has seen strong support around $0.0000126735, but the slow upward momentum and resistance at higher levels have made it difficult for SHIB to regain the kind of rapid growth that Mpeppe (MPEPE) is currently experiencing. Additionally, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been working to expand its ecosystem, with developments in decentralized finance (DeFi) and its own ShibaSwap platform. These initiatives aim to give SHIB more long-term value, but in the short term, Mpeppe (MPEPE) seems to be attracting more speculative investors with its immediate price action. The Rivalry: Will SHIB Rebound Or Will Mpeppe Continue To Dominate? The rivalry between Shiba Inu (SHIB) (SHIB) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) is shaping up to be an interesting one. On one hand, SHIB has the advantage of being a more established project with a large and loyal following. Its ecosystem developments and long-term prospects make it a solid choice for investors looking to hold. On the other hand, Mpeppe is benefiting from its status as the new meme coin on the block, offering fast returns and a unique real-world use case in decentralized gambling. This makes it a prime target for short-term investors seeking quick gains. What’s Next For Mpeppe And Shiba Inu (SHIB)? As more SHIB bulls make their move into Mpeppe (MPEPE), the question remains whether this is a temporary shift or if Mpeppe (MPEPE) will continue to dominate the meme coin space. For now, the price action and investor interest suggest that Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s upward trajectory could continue, especially as more investors discover its potential. For Shiba Inu (SHIB), the coming weeks will be crucial. A breakthrough past key resistance levels could reignite interest in the coin and bring back some of the attention that Mpeppe (MPEPE) has stolen. However, if SHIB continues to struggle with upward momentum, more investors may be tempted to make the switch to Mpeppe (MPEPE). Conclusion: A New Era For Meme Coins? The ongoing rivalry between Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) highlights the dynamic nature of the meme coin space. As new projects like Mpeppe (MPEPE) enter the market with unique propositions, even established coins like SHIB can feel the pressure to innovate and keep up. While Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains a strong contender in the meme coin world, Mpeppe’s rise could mark the beginning of a new era where meme coins are valued not just for their community support, but also for their real-world utility and growth potential. Whether SHIB can keep up remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: Mpeppe (MPEPE) is here to stay, and it’s making a big splash.

33466088,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641208,1726059643,"Presale Coin GoodEgg Rivals FET For A.I Crown, Analyst Predicts Explosive Growth at Launch","As the crypto world continues to witness the rapid growth of AI-driven projects, GoodEgg (GEGG) is emerging as a serious contender in the space. Known for its unique meme-hybrid model with a social scoring system, GoodEgg (GEGG) is capturing attention, raising speculation that it could become the third merger in the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) ecosystem. FET’s Recent Surge: A Look into the AI Giant The Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) has recently seen its native token, FET, gain significant momentum in the crypto market. With a daily growth rate of 13.33%, FET is leading the AI cryptocurrency space, surpassing even some of the most popular tokens, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. The deployment of FET on the Cardano blockchain is a key driver of this growth, as it positions Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) to harness Cardano’s robust infrastructure for a decentralized and ethical AI ecosystem. This milestone has been further amplified by the upcoming rebranding of FET to ASI (Artificial Superintelligence), which could further boost its standing in the market. In the last 24 hours, FET saw a significant increase in trading volume, up 85%, with a total market capitalization now standing at $3.27 billion. Technical indicators suggest that FET’s price is poised to rise even further, with predictions of a 14.33% increase by mid-October. These developments have placed FET in a favorable position within the AI crypto space, but will it be enough to maintain dominance against GoodEgg (GEGG)? GoodEgg (GEGG): The Fastest Growing Opportunity In Current Markets While FET is making waves in the AI sector, GoodEgg (GEGG) has been quietly growing its influence as a unique meme coin with a purpose. Combining viral meme appeal with a powerful social scoring system, GoodEgg is offering something fresh to the market. Its ongoing presale, which has already rallied 187%, is drawing significant interest from investors. Priced at just $0.00015, GoodEgg presents a low entry point for those looking to capitalize on a new wave of meme-driven, AI-enhanced cryptocurrencies. The potential for GoodEgg (GEGG) to join forces with the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) is exciting. Such a merger would blend the powerful, decentralized AI ambitions of FET with the viral, community-driven nature of GoodEgg. This combination could result in a dominant force within both the AI and meme coin spaces, making it a formidable player in the broader crypto market. Why Wall Street Analysts Are Bullish on GoodEgg (GEGG) Top analysts are predicting explosive growth for GoodEgg (GEGG), particularly if it continues on its current trajectory. The integration of AI capabilities into its meme platform could make it a serious rival to FET in the AI crypto sector. What sets GoodEgg apart from other meme coins is its unique approach to social scoring, which could be integrated into decentralized applications (dApps) and other blockchain-based platforms. This feature makes it more than just a meme coin—it gives it practical utility in an increasingly AI-driven world. As GoodEgg continues to evolve, it could potentially outpace other AI-related tokens, including FET, in terms of adoption and usage. FET: Technical Analysis and Market Scope FET remains a strong player in the AI token space, with positive technical signals such as a bullish MACD, RSI, and the crossing of the 50-day SMA. However, despite these bullish indicators, the rise of GoodEgg presents a challenge. While FET has seen consistent growth, the viral nature of GoodEgg could disrupt the current rankings. Market data shows that FET is trading near $1.30, and with continued positive momentum, it could soon breach the $1.39 mark. However, if GoodEgg manages to integrate further into the AI ecosystem or form strategic partnerships, it may attract the attention of institutional investors, creating a significant shift in the competitive landscape. AI-Driven Coins: Can GoodEgg Overtake FET? As the battle for AI dominance intensifies, GoodEgg (GEGG) has positioned itself as a unique contender, leveraging its meme appeal and social scoring system to attract a wide range of investors. Meanwhile, FET continues to grow through its partnerships and technical innovations, making it a leader in the AI crypto world. The question now is whether GoodEgg can maintain its momentum and challenge FET for the top spot in the AI sector. With its presale showing impressive results and its potential for real-world application, GoodEgg could very well be the next big thing in crypto. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, both GoodEgg (GEGG) and FET are coins to watch. Whether through collaboration or competition, these two tokens are set to shape the future of decentralized artificial intelligence in the coming months.

Priced at just $0.00015, GoodEgg is now overshadowing established tokens like Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET), signaling a shift in investor interest towards more innovative and engaging projects. GoodEgg’s ‘Play to Date’ Concept Captures Attention The ‘Play to Date’ model introduced by GoodEgg has captivated crypto enthusiasts and investors alike. Combining social interaction with the viral appeal of meme coins, GoodEgg offers a unique platform where users can engage in playful dating experiences, earning rewards in the process. This fresh approach has not only driven the token’s presale success but also positioned it as a strong contender in the growing field of AI-driven cryptos. With the token’s presale price at $0.00015, analysts are already projecting significant growth for GoodEgg (GEGG), suggesting it could disrupt the meme coin space and outpace tokens like FET in the coming months. FET’s: Technical Analysis and Price Potential Meanwhile, Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) has also been making headlines with its recent price movements. Following a series of major ecosystem updates, including the launch of its native ASI token on the Cardano blockchain, FET witnessed a bullish breakout, with analysts predicting further price increases. FET’s technical indicators such as MACD, RSI, and EMA bands suggest that the token is poised for a potential rise. The price has rebounded from its $1.00 support level, showing bullish momentum, and breaking out of a falling channel pattern. This upward trend could propel FET to even higher levels if it surpasses the 200-day EMA. Despite this positive outlook for FET, the rising popularity of GoodEgg (GEGG) is starting to shift the spotlight away from FET. While FET continues to develop its AI-driven technology, GoodEgg’s viral appeal and innovative ‘Play to Date’ model have attracted the attention of both retail and institutional investors. GoodEgg vs. FET: A Battle of Innovation The competition between GoodEgg (GEGG) and Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) reflects a broader trend in the crypto world where emerging, innovative projects are challenging the status quo. While FET has maintained a strong position with its advanced AI capabilities and collaborations with major projects like SingularityNET, GoodEgg’s unique combination of social interaction and meme coin appeal is attracting a different kind of investor — one looking for rapid growth and community-driven experiences. With GoodEgg (GEGG) offering a low entry price and high growth potential, many investors are turning their focus toward this new AI-powered platform. Its viral nature and the excitement surrounding the ‘Play to Date’ model make GoodEgg a strong contender to lead the next wave of meme coins with real-world utility. GoodEgg’s Growing Momentum As the crypto market continues to evolve, GoodEgg (GEGG) has quickly become one of the most talked-about tokens, outshining more established AI tokens like FET. With its presale rally driving a 187% increase in price and a unique business model that appeals to a wide range of investors, GoodEgg is poised for continued success. While FET remains a strong player in the AI crypto space, GoodEgg’s rapid rise and innovative approach to social engagement are setting it apart as the top AI-driven meme coin to watch in 2024.

33466083,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641206,1726059637,Layer-1 Defi Token Kaspa Becomes Under Threat From This New AI Play-2-Date Meme Sensation Rallying,"As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, meme coins and innovative AI projects are disrupting traditional decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems. GoodEgg (GEGG), a Play 2 Date AI meme sensation, is capturing significant attention in the market, threatening the dominance of established Layer-1 tokens like Kaspa (KAS). While Kaspa (KAS) remains a strong contender in the DeFi sector, its technical struggles could leave room for GoodEgg (GEGG) to become a dominant player in the meme and AI space. Kaspa’s Price Rebound: A Momentary Relief For Holders Kaspa (KAS) recently made headlines with a 3% price increase, pushing it above the $0.15 level. Prominent analyst Dark Horseman has noted this support level as a crucial psychological and technical foundation for Kaspa, suggesting that the token’s resilience at this price point is vital for future growth. However, despite its ability to hold this support, Kaspa (KAS) faces significant resistance at the $0.17050 mark, with additional hurdles at $0.18378 and $0.19883, capping its bullish potential and driving focus toward competitor GoodEgg. While Kaspa’s 50-day exponential moving average (50EMA) and Volume Point of Control (VP-POC) hover around the $0.16297 level, the token has yet to convincingly break through these levels. Stochastic RSI indicators suggest that Kaspa (KAS) could see a price increase as buying interest builds, but the road ahead is uncertain. GoodEgg (GEGG): The AI Play 2 Date Meme Coin That’s Shaking Things Up While Kaspa (KAS) grapples with technical resistance, GoodEgg (GEGG) is experiencing a meteoric rise fueled by its unique blend of AI technology and meme coin appeal. The Play 2 Date platform offered by GoodEgg (GEGG) leverages artificial intelligence in an innovative social scoring system, combining entertainment, utility, and crypto in a way that resonates with a broad audience. As a presale token, GoodEgg (GEGG) has already demonstrated explosive growth, with analysts predicting even more substantial gains at its official launch. GoodEgg (GEGG) taps into the viral nature of meme coins while offering tangible utility through its AI-driven platform, setting it apart from traditional meme coins and even established DeFi tokens like Kaspa (KAS). Kaspa’s Ecosystem and Growing Competition Kaspa (KAS) is known for its advanced Layer-1 DeFi ecosystem, utilizing a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure and Proof of Work (PoW) consensus model to deliver faster transaction speeds and robust security. However, while Kaspa (KAS)’s technical architecture is impressive, the market’s growing interest in meme coins with innovative features like GoodEgg (GEGG) could pose a significant threat to its dominance. The planned introduction of KRC-20 tokens on the Kaspa (KAS) network has been a major talking point, as it opens the door for DeFi projects, meme coins, and other assets to be built on its platform. While this development will likely strengthen Kaspa (KAS)’s ecosystem, the explosive growth of GoodEgg (GEGG) could overshadow Kaspa (KAS) if it fails to maintain momentum and break through key resistance levels. Meme Coins and AI Integration As meme coins like GoodEgg (GEGG) continue to rise, their integration of AI and real-world utility is reshaping the expectations for the sector. GoodEgg (GEGG) is not just another meme token—it is a fusion of entertainment and technology, offering its users an engaging Play 2 Date platform driven by artificial intelligence. This innovative approach has attracted both retail investors and meme enthusiasts, positioning GoodEgg (GEGG) as a leader in the meme coin space. With its AI-driven platform and viral potential, GoodEgg (GEGG) could continue to rally and challenge established tokens like Kaspa (KAS). In Summary: GoodEgg (GEGG) Poised for Explosive Growth While Kaspa (KAS) continues to defend its key support levels and prepare for future developments, the rise of GoodEgg (GEGG) signals a shift in market dynamics. As a meme coin with real utility and an AI-powered platform, GoodEgg (GEGG) offers a unique value proposition that resonates with a wide range of investors. With GoodEgg (GEGG)’s presale already rallying, analysts predict further explosive growth, putting it in direct competition with DeFi tokens like Kaspa (KAS). As the cryptocurrency market evolves, the question remains: will Kaspa (KAS) maintain its foothold, or will GoodEgg (GEGG) rise to dominate the meme coin and AI sectors? Only time will tell.

33466080,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641220,1726059632,Will Nvidia’s Q3 Earnings Affect Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) and GoodEgg (GEGG),"As the world of artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency continues to expand, all eyes are on Nvidia’s Q3 earnings report and how it could impact two key players in the AI crypto space: Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) and GoodEgg (GEGG). Both tokens have seen impressive gains and attention in recent months, but the upcoming earnings could be a turning point for their future trajectories. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) Surges by 16% In a significant development, Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) recently rallied by 16%, fueled by major updates within its ecosystem. This included expanded cross-chain interoperability with Cardano and new improvements to the Fetch.ai wallet, positioning FET as a strong contender in the AI-focused token space. Over the past 24 hours, FET surged from $1.13 to $1.31, with an 86% increase in trading volume, further cementing its place as a top-performing asset in the AI sector. What’s driving this growth? A major factor has been the collaboration between Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) and SingularityNET, allowing for the deployment of FET on the Cardano blockchain. This cross-chain integration enhances the project’s vision of building a decentralized AI ecosystem, making it a stronger player in the crypto market. GoodEgg (GEGG): The AI Social Scoring System Shaking Up the Market While Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) has been making headlines, GoodEgg (GEGG) is quietly positioning itself as a unique contender in the AI-driven cryptocurrency world. What sets GoodEgg apart from other tokens is its groundbreaking approach to blending AI with social interaction through its innovative social scoring system. This system incentivizes engagement on its platform, rewarding users with GEGG tokens based on their activity. With GoodEgg (GEGG) currently priced at just $0.00015, many analysts believe it’s poised for exponential growth. The token has drawn the attention of investors, including significant interest from whales in the crypto space. By using AI to create meaningful connections within the platform, GoodEgg is pushing the boundaries of how AI can be applied in the social and crypto ecosystems. The Nvidia Connection: Will Q3 Earnings Shift the Market? Nvidia’s Q3 earnings report is a pivotal moment for the broader AI and crypto markets. As a major player in the development of AI technologies, Nvidia’s performance could have ripple effects across the industry. Both Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) and GoodEgg (GEGG) are tied to the broader AI landscape, meaning any significant shifts in Nvidia’s outlook could influence investor sentiment in AI-related tokens. A strong earnings report could bolster confidence in AI-driven projects like FET and GoodEgg, potentially driving further investment into these tokens. Conversely, a weaker-than-expected report might create uncertainty, particularly for AI tokens that are still in their growth phase. Future Outlook for FET and GEGG The collaboration between Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) and Cardano, alongside the improvements to the Fetch.ai wallet, position FET as a long-term player in the AI space. However, with Nvidia’s Q3 earnings looming, the token’s near-term performance may hinge on the market’s reaction to broader AI developments. On the other hand, GoodEgg (GEGG) offers a more socially oriented use case, creating an ecosystem that blends crypto with real-world interaction. With its unique social scoring system and low entry price, GEGG has the potential for significant growth, especially if investors see the value in its long-term vision. The interest from whales signals confidence in the project’s ability to capitalize on the growing intersection of AI and cryptocurrency. Conclusion: A Market Ready for Disruption As Nvidia prepares to release its Q3 earnings, the future for both Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) and GoodEgg (GEGG) hangs in the balance. While FET continues to strengthen its ecosystem through cross-chain integration and wallet updates, GoodEgg is emerging as a disruptive force with its innovative use of AI in social engagement. For investors, the upcoming earnings report could serve as a barometer for the future of AI-driven crypto projects. Regardless of Nvidia’s performance, both FET and GEGG are positioning themselves as key players in the rapidly evolving AI and blockchain spaces. Whether through cross-chain advancements or AI-driven social ecosystems, these tokens are poised to make a lasting impact.

However, even with the price on the up and up, there is still some danger lurking around that could stop the rally dead in its tracks. So, it has become important for the BTC price to hold some important levels if the rally is to continue, and one crypto analyst has identified one of the major support levels for this. Bitcoin Must Hold $55,881 Crypto analyst Rekt Capital took to X (formerly Twitter) to inform his 500,000 followers of what is ahead for the Bitcoin price. According to the crypto analyst, the bitcoin price has been able to protect an important level so far and that is the bargain-buying area. Related Reading: Ethereum In 3 Months: Legendary Analyst Reveals Prediction For December This bargain-buying area that Rekt Capital is referring to is the $53,250 level, one to which Bitcoin has held up quite nicely. Despite the breakdown, the fact that this level held shows strength for the digital asset. But even with this, the pioneer cryptocurrency still has a long way to go. As the crypto analyst explains, the fact that the Bitcoin price held the bargain-buying area happened beneath the black Downtrending Channel. This means that bulls would have to hold up momentum to continue the rally, and the best way to do this is to reclaim and hold the $55,881 level as support. #BTC The good news is that Bitcoin has Weekly Close above ~$53250 to protect the very bottom of the bargain-buying area (orange) that has formed beneath the black Downtrending Channel To build on this momentum, Bitcoin would need to next reclaim $55881 (blue) as support to try… https://t.co/pSYJZpk8E3 pic.twitter.com/Y3wPkLouRH — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) September 9, 2024 If this support holds, then the crypto analyst forecasts a possible continuation of the rally. But not just any continuation, one that would drive the price above $60,000 once again. In this case, Bitcoin could be set on a path to a brand-new all-time high. BTC Hitting A Bottom It seems that sentiment is starting to recover as crypto analysts are predicting a rally for the Bitcoin price. Another analyst known as Cousin Crypto on X has pointed out that the BTC price might reach its bottom soon, giving a couple of reasons for this. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Dogecoin Will Rise 3,600% To $3.7, Here’s When For one, the crypto analyst points out that the BTC price has marked its first higher low in 200 days. Next, the potential Fed rate cuts that could happen next week could help strengthen the Bitcoin price. Third on the list is that the market is still sitting in Extreme Fear, which usually marks market bottoms. Given all of these, the analyst believes that there are bottom signals flashing for the Bitcoin price. In line with Rekt Capital’s analysis, if the Bitcoin price does bottom, then the next leg-up could put the price above $60,000 quickly.

Earlier this year, the SEC told Binance.US to be more forthcoming in answering requests for information, specifically mentioning custody of customers’ assets.  Binance.US, the American arm of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, is working with crypto custody firm Fireblocks to reassure users and regulators that customer assets on the exchange are handled in a safe and compliant manner while also bolstering crypto-token staking services.  The company will use Fireblocks wallet tech to power custody operations, customer deposits and withdrawals, the companies said on Wednesday. Fireblocks’ key-management system will also help expand staking services on the exchange, which has a relatively large selection of staked tokens for a U.S.-based platform.  Established in 2019, Binance.US became the subject of intense scrutiny by regulators as part of a sweeping enforcement action last year against Binance itself, the U.S. affiliate and the founder of the exchange group, Changpeng Zhao, citing a variety of securities law violations.  In March of this year, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), complained that Binance.US was not being entirely forthcoming in complying with requests for information about its customers' assets, with specific mention of custody and control over private and administrative keys.  As regulators put more focus on security and compliance, it’s crucial for platforms to use technology that can check all boxes without sacrificing user experience, Fireblocks CEO Michael Shaulov said.  “By integrating our wallet infrastructure, Binance.US is ensuring its custody operations are rock solid and fully aligned with what regulators are asking for,” Shaulov told CoinDesk in an email. “With Fireblocks, they can scale up staking operations securely and efficiently, giving users a smoother experience while staking their tokens and earning rewards.”",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | BNB,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/09/11/binanceus-chooses-fireblocks-to-bolster-crypto-custody-staking-services,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3bb493ad5430f73912182503114c7ab3aceba601-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42407677,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga0kLs,1726059600,"Osmosis Launches Cross-Chain Token Portal 'Polaris,' Expanding Beyond Cosmos Roots","Osmosis, the popular decentralized exchange (DEX), announced the launch of Polaris, described as a ""token portal"" aimed at solving one of decentralized finance's biggest challenges: fragmented user experience.  According to the team, the platform will allow users to trade tokens across multiple blockchains through a single interface, eliminating the need for multiple wallets, bridges, and gas tokens.  Polaris marks a strategy shift for Osmosis, one of the flagship networks in the Cosmos ecosystem’s web of interconnected blockchains.  The exchange has historically promoted itself as a unified liquidity venue for Cosmos-based networks. Polaris, by contrast, will work equally well for non-Cosmos chains like Ethereum and Solana, and it will take a new approach to dealing with liquidity.  ""We still believe in our original hypothesis, which is that people want to trade everything in one spot,"" Sunny Aggarwal, co-founder of Osmosis and Polaris, said in an interview with CoinDesk. ""But trying to aggregate everything into a single liquidity venue is just not going to work.""  The assets that people trade on Osmosis live inside of ""liquidity pools"" – crypto wallets on the Osmosis network that are pre-programmed to buy and sell tokens from users. This system is similar to the one used by popular decentralized exchanges like Uniswap, and it means that liquidity – the piles of tokens traded on Osmosis and other DEXes – are scattered across dozens of different exchange apps.  “The UX of DeFi today feels extremely fragmented as everything is architected in a very chain-centric way,” Aggarwal said in a statement shared with CoinDesk. Chains often focus on metrics like total value locked (TVL) – collateral or deposits locked into a DeFi protocol – to attract capital, resulting in fragmented liquidity and a suboptimal user experience (UX), said the team.  As a result of the ""Great Chain Divide,"" as Osmosis calls it, DeFi platforms generally operate in their own little universes, each with its own stockpiles of assets for users to buy and sell. Because these stockpiles tend to live on different blockchains, serious crypto trading generally requires one to download and keep track of a myriad of different wallet tools – a huge pain for users.  Polaris lets users trade tokens between different blockchain networks without forcing those assets to reside in a single spot.  ""Polaris is us taking a lot of the UX and UI components that, on Osmosis, we think are pretty awesome, and then we make them work in a cross-chain way,"" said Aggarwal. ""So you can trade EVM assets and Solana assets and Cosmos assets and everything in one DEX.""  Polaris manually integrates with existing DEXes and liquidity venues rather than competing with them, allowing users to access liquidity across networks. The platform’s ""bridge abstraction"" feature also enables seamless cross-chain trading, making it possible for users to swap assets like USDC on Ethereum for Bitcoin without the friction of manual processes. Additionally, users can track their entire portfolio across multiple chains in one place.  Polaris isn't the first platform to help users trade assets between chains. Centralized exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken have long allowed similar functionality, but they come with the caveat that they take full custody of user assets – anathema to crypto principles around ""decentralization.""  Other DeFi products have taken swings at similar tech, however, and Polaris will need to differentiate itself in what's sure to be a crowded field of UX-focused competitors.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | SOL | TRADING,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/09/11/osmosis-launches-cross-chain-token-portal-polaris-expanding-beyond-cosmos-roots,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c1745ba0dc22d93c8ed183977c5cfc1c9c6cd1c2-5184x2916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The CPI rose 0.2% in August versus economist forecasts for 0.2% and 0.2% in July. On a year-over-year basis, CPI was higher by 2.5% against expectations for 2.6% and 2.9% in July.  Core CPI – which excludes food and energy costs – rose 0.3% in August, faster than a forecast 0.2% and 0.2% in July. The core rate year-over-year was 3.2% against an anticipated 3.2% and 3.2% in July.  Down marginally for the day coming into the inflation print, the price of bitcoin {{BTC}} fell a bit more in the minutes following the news, now lower by 1.5% over the past 24 hours to $56,500.  In traditional markets, U.S. stock index futures have added a bit to losses, with the both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq down 0.5%. The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield has gained 3 basis points to 3.68% and the dollar index has risen 0.15%. The price of gold has dipped 0.45% to $2,532 per ounce.  Ahead of the data, investors had priced in a 71% chance the Fed would trim its benchmark fed funds rate range by 25 basis points to 5%-5.25% when it meets next week, with a 29% chance the central bank cuts by 50 basis points to 4.75%-5%, according to CME FedWatch. The stubborn persistence of core inflation reflected in this morning's report – which monetary policymakers often prefer versus the headline number – is likely to solidify expectations of the Fed moving by the lower amount.  Indeed, 15 minutes following the CPI release, the chances of the Fed cutting by 25 next week has jumped to 85%. A check of months further out finds the odds that the Fed slashes rates by just 75 basis points by year-end has risen to 14% versus 9% one day ago.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,Stephen Alpher,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/11/us-core-inflation-rose-03-in-august-faster-than-anticipated,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/14a0581fc2c083d7e2e1854b39e7772bb1e8e083-5472x3648.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42417280,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTXqDV,1726057800,Doors Open at Prometheum as Much-Disputed Firm Tests Crypto Tokens as Securities,"The custody function of crypto platform Prometheum Inc. is now open for institutional clients.  Prometheum had soft-launched with ETH and later added UNI and ARB to the assets it'll support, and this week the company said it'll also take custody of OP and GRT.  Co-CEO Aaron Kaplan said Prometheum is trying to become the PayPal of crypto.  While the broader crypto industry fights with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission about the agency's labeling of most tokens as securities, Prometheum is swinging open its doors for a long-awaited test of its strategy to assume the SEC is right.  The company is now ready to accept institutional clients' holdings of Ethereum's ether {{ETH}}, Uniswap {{UNI}} and Arbitrum {{ARB}}, and it's added two more tokens: Optimism's {{OP}} and The Graph {{GRT}}. It opened its custody business on Wednesday after a previous soft-launch period, and the firm is on its way to starting a trading operation in the ""very near future,"" said Benjamin Kaplan, the CEO of Prometheum Capital and Co-CEO of its parent company, Prometheum Inc.  Prometheum's untested advantage: It was the first fully registered crypto special-purpose broker dealer under the SEC's rules, and it's licensed for clearing and settlement, making it a potential one-stop shop as the business becomes fully operational. Until this week, that was a solitary status, but tZero Group Inc. said it got the same broker-dealer license and hopes to launch products next year.  However, much of the rest of the industry and prominent Republican lawmakers claim it's impossible to run such a crypto business under the existing securities laws, and Prometheum hasn't yet disclosed any customers or revenue to prove its critics wrong.  Kaplan said there's been ""an immense amount of interest"" from potential users and issuers.  ""We're trying to be the PayPal of the digital asset industry,"" said Aaron Kaplan, who shares the CEO duty with his brother, in an interview with both Kaplans. He said there's no ecosystem at the moment that's set to be a compliant infrastructure for the ""full life cycle"" of securities products issued on-chain, which is especially important as interest rises for the tokenization of assets.  Prometheum Capital's addition of the tokens from Optimism, an Ethereum-based layer-two blockchain, and The Graph, a decentralized protocol for indexing and querying data from blockchains, was announced alongside the grand opening.  ""This is just the beginning,"" Benjamin Kaplan said of the launch with five eligible tokens. ""We're going to have quite a full vending machine.""  The company does not yet have a public timeline for launching trading and settlement services.  Read More: Controversial Crypto Firm Prometheum to Treat Uniswap and Arbitrum's Tokens as Securities  When asked whether the company has had any clear conversations with the regulator over whether its approach is viable, Kaplan declined to detail interactions except to say Prometheum communicates with the SEC in the normal course of business.  An SEC spokesman declined a request for comment on the agency's view of Prometheum's custody operation.  The business' survival represents one of a handful of crucial industry tests, which would also include the outcome of a number of federal court battles. In Prometheum's case, if the SEC accepts its business model, that could prove it's possible to run a crypto platform under current laws, as argued by SEC Chair Gary Gensler. But if the SEC puts a stop to it, it counters the years-old argument from the agency that digital assets businesses need only comply with the laws to satisfy the agency.  Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Rostin Behnam said in congressional testimony this year that a move from the SEC that validates Prometheum's treatment of ETH as a security will throw into question the longstanding position of CFTC-regulated firms that it's a commodity.  ""We're not here to fight the battle between regulators,"" Benjamin Kaplan said. ""We're proceeding under the federal securities laws as we believe it's the best framework to protect customers.""",NEUTRAL,ETH | UNI | ARB,BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | UNI | ARB,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/09/11/doors-open-at-prometheum-as-much-disputed-firm-tests-crypto-tokens-as-securities,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7722cfad28aaae080f88a312d4d3b949e122659a-5616x3159.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42417288,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTXqJh,1726056713,A Bitcoin Chart That Offers Hope to Battered Crypto Bulls,"BTC's price action since late April contradicts the persistently bearish MACD signal.  The divergence means potential for a sudden bull revival.  Talk about bearish factors in the crypto market, and there are plenty right now, ranging from U.S. economic slowdown, yen strength, political uncertainty, and dwindling blockchain activity.  However, bitcoin's {{BTC}} technical studies, particularly related to the weekly price chart, offer hope.  Technical analysis is often seen with skepticism, with critics likening it to ""hocus pocus"" due to its reliance on past data and indicators rather than fundamentals. However, how price behaves in relation to trend-tracking indicators can provide insights into the strength of ongoing price trajectory and potential momentum shifts.  In bitcoin's case, the weekly MACD histogram, gauging momentum using 12-week and 26-week exponential moving averages, has been negative since April, occasionally flashing the strongest bearish signal since 2022.  Bitcoin's price, however, has been locked in a slightly downward sloping channel between $50,000 and $70,000, forming a bull flag-like pattern, as opposed to a steep downtrend, contradicting the persistent MACD signal.  Thomas N. Bulkowski, one of the world's leading authorities on chart patterns, defines a bull flag as a period of consolidation characterized by a slight downward-sloping channel that follows a steep uptrend. The pause often refreshes higher, extending the preceding uptrend.  The combination of a persistently bearish MACD since late April and a flag-like price pattern hints at bullish vibes beneath the surface. In other words, sellers haven't been able to establish a strong downtrend, with losses persistently capped between $55,000 and $50,000 even during the panic-selling of early August.  The prolonged seller exhaustion means the potential for a sudden bull revival and price increases. Supporting that outlook are upward trending 50-, 100- and 200-week simple moving averages, indicating bullish momentum and the green Ichimoku cloud, a sign of long-term bullish bias.  That said, traders should keep an eye on the incoming macroeconomic data and trends in traditional markets.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/11/a-bitcoin-chart-that-offers-hope-to-battered-crypto-bulls,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f53f2257d3587b15b51a51e172f6953f1b691c91-3998x2249.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The rules cover standards for authorization, stress testing and methods to estimate the number and value of transactions for stablecoin issuers.  Standards laying out how stablecoin issuers such as Tether and Circle can operate in the European Union (EU) are likely to become official toward the end of the year, a spokesperson from the European Banking Authority (EBA) told CoinDesk.  They are included in the 15 technical standards submitted by the EBA, which was tasked with developing them alongside the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), to the European Commission, the EU's executive branch.  Rules allowing crypto companies to serve clients across the 27-nation trading bloc with a single license, known as MiCA, passed into law last year. The stablecoin rules came into force in June, and the rest of MiCA will be in place by December.  The commission is looking over the standards and will need to decide whether to adopt the texts as is or whether to request changes. The standards cover authorization, stress testing and methods to estimate the number and value of transactions among other issues.  Once the commission has signed off, the rules will need to be scrutinized by the European Parliament and European Council. Then they have to go through translation and formal adoption before being published in the official journal. That is where the bloc's official acts and information appear.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 1,791.61 −1.35%  Bitcoin (BTC): $56,496.83 −1.1%  Ether (ETH): $2,314.39 −1.45%  S&P 500: 5,495.52 +0.45%  Gold: $2,521.60 +0.11%  Nikkei 225: 35,619.77 −1.49%  Top Stories  Bitcoin slid to just over $56,000 after Kamala Harris was perceived to have bettered Donald Trump in their first presidential debate. BTC recovered to over $56,500 during the European morning, but remained around 1.3% lower over 24 hours. The broader digital asset market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index, dropped about 1%. The Japanese yen rallied to 140.70 per U.S. dollar, its strongest since January, appreciating beyond the early August level of 141.68 in a sign of a move away from riskier assets. The yen picked up a strong bid in late July after the Bank of Japan hiked interest rates for the first time in decades.  Vice President Kamala Harris appears to have beaten Donald Trump in the first debate between the U.S. presidential candidates on Tuesday, based on the direction of prediction bets on Polymarket, while crypto policy went unmentioned. Despite Harris' performance, the two are effectively tied in the Polymarket contract for who will win the election, with Harris' odds increasing slightly during the course of the debate. The debate did not delve into crypto, or even general technology or finance issues beyond a section on the economy. Trump, as he has been doing in recent weeks, touted the benefit of tariffs during his time on the stand, saying he would have ""substantial tariffs."" Harris pushed back, saying Trump left the Biden administration with a trade deficit, ""one of the highest we've seen in history.""  Mining was much less profitable in August than July as BTC slid and the average network hashrate rose about 2.7%, investment bank Jefferies said. Miners' average daily revenue per exahash fell by 11.8% from the previous month as a result, the report said. ""September is shaping up to be another difficult month as BTC remains below $60K and the network hashrate continues to climb,"" analysts wrote. Jefferies notes that there were fewer days of extreme heat this summer, which meant better uptime for the largest miners. The bitcoin mined by Marathon Digital last month implies roughly 88% uptime, compared with 75% in August last year. For the 10 largest bitcoin miners the bank tracks, implied uptime last month was around 83% versus 76% a year ago and 79% in August 2022.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the distribution of open interest or active positions in bitcoin options listed on Deribit.  Most open interest is concentrated in call options at higher strikes, with the $100,000 bet being the most popular.  It shows that sentiment remains bullish despite the recent price swoon.

While it did record some gains in recent days, CoinCodex’s price prediction still projects a 13% decline, which may further drive DOGE to $0.088742 by October 10, 2024.

As Kenobi says, every downtrend is retreating in duration, which in turn means that the bears may exhaust themselves, and it could clear the way for a recovery. The #DOGE bear market consisted of three major downtrend cycles. Whether it’s a coincidence or not, the first cycle lasted 540 days, nearly 1.5 years; the second lasted 364 days, exactly one year; and we are now concluding the third downtrend cycle, which lasted approximately 182… pic.twitter.com/GToZmRaPCh — Master Kenobi (@btc_MasterPlan) September 9, 2024 He explained that the initial downtrend lasted 540 days, or approximately 1.5 years while the second cycle was 364 days. Against these, he said, the ongoing downtrend has seen only 182 days, or roughly six months. As a matter of fact, the compressing length of such cycles could be seen as a signal for a momentum shift, setting things up for a likely bull run. Dogecoin Price Action Dogecoin is currently trading at $0.1003, up 6% in the last seven days. The price had bounced off a support line of $0.089 and a bullish falling wedge pattern on DOGE’s daily chart has been identified. Dogecoin’s price would rapidly shoot to $0.15 if it maintains the level above $0.10, the chart suggests. Fear And Market Sentiment Despite the recent upward movement, market sentiment still lies in fear. The Fear & Greed Index stands at 33 for now and illustrates the amount of fear investors have. This, despite the performance of Dogecoin in the last 30 days, which stood at 15 green days up. The price movements of DOGE, on the other hand, usually come pretty stable as the positivity rate stood at 50%. Volatility remains very low, standing at 4.38%. While stability can be reassuring, it also suggests that DOGE lacks the momentum for a major breakout. Mixed signals in the market have made investors wary of taking any particular call. Investors seem to be performing a balancing act between short-term optimism and longer-term risks. The low volatility and an equal number of green days signal consolidation without showing any reversal signals.

According to CoinCodex, this cryptocurrency might fall 13.78%, putting Dogecoin at $0.088742 by October 2024. The above forecast really conflicts with the current bullish momentum of this token. Dogecoin is, therefore, at a crossroads. While the short-term indications may suggest some bullish momentum, technical indicators and recent price action indeed support a plausible rally for the meme crypto. But until then, the bearish long-term forecast continues with ongoing market fear; it would be best to exercise caution. Investors will do well by keeping a close eye on the short-term price action and broader market development before making serious moves.

42417286,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTXqIf,1726054200,Crypto Goes Unmentioned Again at Second Presidential Debate,"Crypto did not emerge as a topic of discussion during the second presidential debate, but that didn't stop the candidates from going back and forth on a number of other topics.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  'Concepts of a plan'  The narrative  The 2024 U.S. presidential election is less than two months away. On Tuesday night, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump met to argue for their respective visions of and for America.  Why it matters  The election is in less than two months. In a little over four months, the U.S. will have a new commander-in-chief, who can nominate new regulatory agency and Department heads and drive policy. Obviously, the crypto industry is interested. Alas, the issue did not make an appearance Tuesday night.  Breaking it down  There's really not a whole lot to say here. A group of CoinDesk reporters watched it and you can read my coverage with my colleague Sam Reynolds here. Some quick takeaways:  Polymarket had Trump up by a few cents in its 2024 election winner market before the debate started. By the end, he and Harris were tied.  Polymarket believes Harris won the debate itself. The contract will resolve after the next Ipsos/538 poll is published with snap results. An immediate CNN poll agreed.  That prior headline has made some people on X (formerly Twitter) a bit upset. Take it up with the Polymarket bettors.  Harris' strategy seems to have been to bait Trump (comments on crowd sizes, anyone?) and otherwise appeal to undecided, centrist voters in this election, with remarks about the border, being a gun owner, tax credits for young families, tax deductions to small businesses and protecting healthcare rights like abortion.  Trump's strategy seems to have been to focus on the contrasts between him and President Joe Biden, whose administration Harris is a part of. He commented on his COVID response, his plan to impose tariffs on foreign companies importing goods and otherwise establish himself as the man with the existing bona-fides.  Forget crypto, tech issues generally didn't make an appearance in this debate. Artificial intelligence, the recent Google monopoly ruling, datacenter expansion, the PS5 Pro being a whopping $700, Huawei introducing a trifold cellular phone that costs four times the PS5 Pro, none of these made the (a little over) 90-minute debate (though to be clear, the moderators did have a lot of topics to get to and there was a lot of extemporaneous back-and-forth.  You can read fact-checks of the candidates' claims from NPR, CNN or the Wall Street Journal here (WSJ did not publish one unified article hence the Google link) or at your favorite news organization.  It's unclear whether another debate will be scheduled. Harris campaign officials said they wanted one, while Trump said he'd ""look at it.""  The vice presidential nominees – Sen. J.D. Vance and Gov. Tim Walz – will debate on Oct. 1.

This week  Tuesday  14:00 UTC (10:00 a.m. EDT) The House Financial Services Committee held a subcommittee hearing on decentralized finance.  01:00 UTC Wed. (9:00 p.m. EDT) Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump held a debate (see above).  Thursday  14:30 UTC (10:30 a.m. EDT) Kalshiex recently won a case against the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission arguing it should be allowed to list and trade political events contracts (i.e. prediction markets), which the CFTC previously blocked. The CFTC is asking for the judge overseeing the case to prevent Kalshi from immediately listing these contracts while it figures out if it's going to appeal – importantly, the judge has, as of press time, not published a detailed opinion explaining her order, which the CFTC argues it needs to review. Kalshi, of course, opposed any kind of stay. The judge scheduled a hearing for this Thursday.  16:00 UTC (12:00 p.m. EDT) Former FTX Digital Markets CEO Ryan Salame will appear in court after previously asking Judge Lewis Kaplan to withdraw his guilty plea or vacate his sentence, alleging the Department of Justice lied to him about not prosecuting his partner, Michelle Bond. Salame is trying to withdraw that motion, but the judge wants him in court anyway.  Elsewhere:  (The Wall Street Journal) There was (apparently) a Tik Tok trend where people discovered a ""money glitch"" where they could deposit a check to their Chase Bank accounts and immediately withdraw the cash, even if they didn't have enough funds. People did this, seemingly unaware that it's called ""check fraud."" Long story short Chase is now referring these customers to law enforcement officials.  (NBC) Congress faces a Sept. 30 deadline for continuing to fund the government.  (Politico) Politico dug into some of the fights within and around Fairshake, the crypto-focused super political action committee.  (NBC) So this went in a weird direction. A group of lawmakers, including Vice Presidential nominee and Sen. J.D. Vance, claimed that immigrants were eating pets in Springfield, Ohio (a claim reiterated by Donald Trump on the debate stage Tuesday night). This is not the case, but it's a claim that's spreading.

While the broader cryptocurrency market has experienced fluctuations, both Helium (HNT) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are making significant moves that have captured the attention of investors. Helium’s Rise in the Web 3.0 Space Helium (HNT) has gained recognition as one of the most influential projects in the Web 3.0 space. As the world shifts towards decentralized internet systems, Web 3.0 cryptocurrencies like Helium (HNT) are leading the charge.

Companies like Helium (HNT), Chainlink (LINK), and Filecoin (FIL) are reshaping how decentralized systems operate, and Helium’s technology has been at the forefront, offering innovative solutions for peer-to-peer networks and decentralized communication. The Competitive Edge of Helium in the Market Among the key players in the market, Helium (HNT) stands out for its practical application in the IoT sector.

In addition, Helium (HNT) has expanded its reach by entering new markets such as Puerto Rico and through partnerships with major platforms, including Anchorage Digital, a self-custody wallet that now supports HNT. This expansion demonstrates Helium (HNT)’s growing market dominance and the strength of its decentralized network technology.

The Growing Influence of Web 3.0 Cryptocurrencies The market for Web 3.0 cryptocurrencies is booming, with Helium (HNT) leading the charge alongside competitors like Chainlink (LINK) and Filecoin (FIL). These platforms are revolutionizing the way decentralized networks operate, with a focus on making data exchange, communications, and financial transactions more secure and efficient. As Web 3.0 expands, cryptocurrencies like Helium (HNT) will continue to play a central role in shaping the future of decentralized systems. The Web 3.0 market is also drawing attention from new entrants like Mpeppe (MPEPE), which is leveraging decentralized finance and gaming to carve out a niche in the cryptocurrency space. As Web 3.0 technologies mature, the demand for cryptocurrencies that can integrate seamlessly with decentralized applications will continue to grow. The Future of Helium and Mpeppe Helium’s strong fundamentals, supported by its decentralized wireless network and expanding user base, make it a standout in the Web 3.0 space.

At the same time, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s entry into the decentralized gambling market represents a unique opportunity for investors looking for high-growth potential. The combination of decentralized finance and the rapidly expanding gaming sector could make Mpeppe (MPEPE) a powerful player in the cryptocurrency market. In conclusion, both Helium and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are making significant strides in their respective sectors. Helium’s dominance in the Web 3.0 market, coupled with its technological advancements, makes it a strong contender for continued growth. Meanwhile, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s innovative approach to decentralized gambling provides it with an exciting growth opportunity in a rapidly evolving space.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Moves Beyond Meme Status Originally launched as a meme coin, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has grown far beyond its initial conception. Once considered a simple “Dogecoin killer,” Shiba Inu has transformed into a multifaceted cryptocurrency ecosystem, featuring developments that attract serious attention from both developers and investors. With the introduction of Shibarium, ShibaSwap 2.0, and the Shiba Inu Metaverse, the token now offers a range of utility-based services that distance it from its meme coin origins. The year 2024 has been pivotal for Shiba Inu (SHIB), as its developer activity has reached new heights. Recent advancements on the Shibarium platform have pushed the project into the spotlight, with more smart contracts being deployed and developer engagement hitting a three-month high. These developments are reshaping the future of Shiba Inu (SHIB), making it one of the most promising altcoins in the market. Shiba Inu (SHIB) and GoodEgg (GEGG) Gains From Bitcoin Price Rise With Bitcoin’s potential rise to $110,000 looming, the spillover effect on altcoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and GoodEgg (GEGG) is anticipated to be massive. Historically, Bitcoin’s upward movements have had a positive impact on the wider crypto market, pushing up altcoin prices as investor sentiment improves. Shiba Inu (SHIB), with its ecosystem growing rapidly, stands to gain significantly from a Bitcoin rally. Its developer community is actively enhancing its utility, and platforms like Shibarium are making it easier for investors to use Shiba Inu (SHIB) in real-world applications. GoodEgg (GEGG), on the other hand, is attracting attention due to its unique approach. As the first Play 2 Date cryptocurrency, it combines social engagement with financial rewards, allowing users to earn tokens by participating in virtual dating activities. The coin has surged by 187% during its presale phase, and it’s expected to keep climbing as the demand for this innovative blend of social engagement and cryptocurrency grows. Investors are drawn to GoodEgg (GEGG) because it offers a mix of fun and utility, unlike traditional meme coins. Early Investors Win Big from Early Adoptions of Meme Coin Pre-sales play a critical role in the success of emerging crypto projects, offering early investors the opportunity to get in at the ground level before the tokens are released to the public. In 2024, pre-sales are drawing significant attention, with projects like Shiba Inu (SHIB), VeChain, and Artemis demonstrating the potential for high returns. Shiba Inu (SHIB) has used its pre-sales and early offerings to build a strong foundation for growth, moving beyond its meme status to become a serious contender in the altcoin space. Similarly, GoodEgg (GEGG) has used its presale to generate significant interest, selling over 2.4 billion tokens at the attractive price of $0.00015. With a 15% bonus on all purchases, early investors are taking advantage of the opportunity to be part of a project that merges entertainment with the financial incentives of cryptocurrency. The success of GoodEgg (GEGG)’s presale is a testament to the growing appeal of hybrid crypto models that combine real-world applications with digital rewards. Analyst Predict Unprecedented Gains For Alt Coins As Bitcoin edges closer to the $110,000 mark, analysts are predicting that altcoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and GoodEgg (GEGG) could see their values skyrocket. The forecasted 18,887% surge for these coins is tied directly to the broader market sentiment, which tends to follow Bitcoin’s trajectory. Shiba Inu (SHIB), with its rapidly expanding ecosystem and increased developer activity, is well-positioned to capitalize on the bullish market. Meanwhile, GoodEgg (GEGG)continues to capture the market’s attention through its innovative Play 2 Date model, making it an attractive option for investors looking for long-term gains in the meme coin space. Its combination of social engagement and cryptocurrency rewards offers something new and exciting, and with the current presale pricing, it’s clear that investors are eager to be part of the next big thing in crypto. Overall Anaylsis: With Bitcoin predicted to hit $110,000, the ripple effect across the crypto market could see altcoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and GoodEgg (GEGG) experience unprecedented gains. Shiba Inu (SHIB), having moved far beyond its meme origins, is well-placed to thrive, especially with its growing developer community and innovative platforms like Shibarium and ShibaSwap 2.0.

33462002,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641152,1726052126,2024 Mememathon Continues: New ‘Play 2 Date’ Presale Onboards Shiba Inu Holders After Seeking Explosive Growth,"The 2024 memecoin space has been buzzing with activity, and GoodEgg (GEGG) is right at the heart of it. As part of its Play 2 Date presale, GoodEgg (GEGG) is drawing significant attention, particularly from Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders who are looking for new and innovative opportunities after seeing the potential for explosive growth. Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) Launches New Staking Opportunity with K9 Finance For the Shiba Inu (SHIB) community, the recent launch of the K9 Finance Liquid Staking Derivative (LSD) platform has created a lot of excitement. Set to go live on September 18th, this new platform allows current BONE token holders to stake their tokens and receive rewards in return. Unlike traditional staking methods, investors have the flexibility to exchange their staked BONE for knBONE, a liquid token that enhances usability within the Shibarium ecosystem. This is a major development for Shiba Inu (SHIB), as it offers new ways to increase value while improving security. The platform’s successful smart contract audit has reassured the community about its safety, further boosting confidence in the Shibarium ecosystem. From Unknown to Unstoppable: Why Shiba Inu Holders Are Looking at GoodEgg (GEGG) As Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders look for new opportunities, GoodEgg (GEGG) has presented itself as an attractive option. The Play 2 Date model combines the fun of virtual dating with cryptocurrency rewards, allowing users to earn tokens for participating in social activities. With over 2.4 billion GoodEgg (GEGG) tokens sold in its presale and a 15% bonus on all purchases, the project has caught the attention of investors. The presale phase of GoodEgg (GEGG) has been highly successful, and its innovative approach has helped it stand out in the crowded meme coin space. This surge in popularity is fueled by its gamified features, where users can unlock NFTs, gain levels in the dating platform, and earn rewards—all while participating in a socially driven ecosystem. For Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors, who have long been part of a strong community focused on building utility beyond meme coin hype, the promise of a similar approach with GoodEgg (GEGG) is appealing. Many Shiba Inu (SHIB)holders are seeking projects with long-term growth potential and practical use cases, which GoodEgg (GEGG) delivers with its combination of entertainment and financial incentives. Social-Based Crypto Platform Leads Trend with Play-2-Date innovation The introduction of social-based crypto platforms like GoodEgg (GEGG) reflects a broader trend in the cryptocurrency market, where users are increasingly seeking more interactive and engaging ways to earn tokens. The concept of Play 2 Date is an evolution of the Play 2 Earn model, adding a layer of social interaction to the already successful play-and-earn concept. This shift is attracting a wide variety of investors, from retail traders to larger whales, including those holding Shiba Inu (SHIB). Meanwhile, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is continuing its own evolution, moving beyond its meme coin roots and into more utility-driven platforms. With the new developments from K9 Finance and the increasing functionality of the Shibarium ecosystem, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is positioning itself for long-term sustainability. This has led many Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders to also take notice of GoodEgg (GEGG), seeing it as a similar project that has the potential to combine fun with meaningful financial returns. K9 Finance and GoodEgg (GEGG) Unlock Robust Ecosystems As K9 Finance launches its new staking platform, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is set to see an increase in its total value locked (TVL), which could stabilize prices and further strengthen the community’s confidence. The Shibarium ecosystem is expected to benefit from a boost in engagement and financial inflows, thanks to the flexibility and security offered by the new staking derivative platform. Meanwhile, GoodEgg (GEGG) continues to onboard investors, particularly from the Shiba Inu (SHIB) community, who are eager to explore this innovative project. With a strong presale performance and an exciting roadmap ahead, GoodEgg (GEGG) is carving out a space for itself in the meme coin market by offering more than just hype—it delivers real-world value through its social and gamified platform. A New Era for Meme Coins: A Final Thought The memecoin landscape is evolving rapidly, and both Shiba Inu (SHIB) and GoodEgg (GEGG) are at the forefront of this exciting movement. Whether it’s through staking or social engagement, these projects offer unique opportunities for investors in 2024. Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues to solidify its foundation with new staking features, while GoodEgg (GEGG) brings a new dimension of fun and financial reward with its Play 2 Date model.

U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump faced off in a highly anticipated debate on Tuesday. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) was down 1.2% to $56.3K as at 6:50 am ET. Former President Trump has shown commitment to championing Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), including considering designating it as a strategic asset under government stewardship . After the presidential debate, the odds of a Harris win rose, leading to a slide in BTC prices. ""Bitcoin, which is seen as a Trump trade, has fallen -2.5% since the start of the debate. So the market for now seems to have some agreement with the probabilities above as to how the debate went,"" Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid said.

33461943,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641149,1726051996,New Dogecoin Rival Creates Cryptocurrency With ‘Social Scoring System’ Currently Priced at $0.00015,"The meme coin world is buzzing with the emergence of GoodEgg (GEGG), a new cryptocurrency that combines meme coin energy with real-world utility through a unique “social scoring system.” Priced at $0.00015 during its presale, GoodEgg (GEGG) is quickly gaining traction, positioning itself as a formidable rival to Dogecoin (DOGE). While Dogecoin continues to focus on scalability and business adoption through its ambitious trailmap, GoodEgg (GEGG) is capturing the attention of crypto investors looking for something more than just a meme. Dogecoin’s (DOGE) Trailmap to Increase Adoption Rate The Dogecoin Foundation has made significant progress on its trailmap, with the completion of 100% of its first phase and 90% of its second phase. This development is focused on breaking down barriers to adoption for businesses and making Dogecoin (DOGE) a more viable currency for everyday transactions. Key elements include the GigaWallet, which simplifies Dogecoin (DOGE) integration for companies, and LibDogecoin, which makes it easier for developers to build on the Dogecoin (DOGE) blockchain. These projects are part of a broader effort to scale Dogecoin (DOGE), including the introduction of Project Sakura, which aims to increase Dogecoin’s (DOGE) block speed and size by tenfold. This could significantly improve Dogecoin’s (DOGE) scalability, making it more efficient for processing transactions without compromising its decentralized nature. While Dogecoin (DOGE) has seen widespread attention, particularly after Elon Musk’s continued endorsements, the market is starting to recognize GoodEgg (GEGG) as a viable competitor that brings new features to the meme coin space. GoodEgg (GEGG): The Hottest Meme Coin Right Now Unlike many meme coins that exist solely for speculative trading, GoodEgg (GEGG) offers a more robust framework, integrating a “social scoring system” within its ecosystem. Users can earn rewards based on their engagement, social interactions, and contributions within the community. This system aligns with the Social-Fi trend, where digital assets are earned through social behaviors, not just financial transactions. Priced at $0.00015 during its presale, GoodEgg (GEGG has already sold over 2.4 billion tokens, with strong interest from early investors. By introducing a “social scoring system,” GoodEgg (GEGG) taps into the growing demand for utility-based meme coins, offering real-world applications alongside the fun of earning tokens through social engagement. Why Dogecoin (DOGE) Investors Are Interested in GoodEgg (GEGG) While Dogecoin (DOGE) is busy focusing on improving its infrastructure with projects like GigaWallet and Project Sakura, a portion of its community has started looking at GoodEgg (GEGG) as a new frontier for meme coins with real utility. The social scoring system introduced by GoodEgg (GEGG) offers users tangible rewards for their interactions within the platform, providing both fun and financial incentives. This is why Dogecoin (DOGE) investors are showing interest in GoodEgg (GEGG). With its emphasis on creating a socially driven ecosystem, GoodEgg (GEGG offers a different value proposition, appealing to those looking for long-term opportunities in the meme coin market. Dogecoin (DOGE) and GoodEgg (GEGG): Complementary Forces? Although Dogecoin (DOGE) remains the dominant meme coin, GoodEgg (GEGG) is positioning itself as a complementary player with a focus on social engagement and reward systems. While Dogecoin’s (DOGE) Project Sakura aims to increase its transaction speed and scalability, GoodEgg (GEGG) is leveraging the growing interest in social interactions within the crypto space. Dogecoin’s (DOGE) infrastructure projects, including LibDogecoin and GigaWallet, aim to make DOGE a viable payment solution for businesses and individuals. However, GoodEgg (GEGG) is carving out its niche by focusing on the Social-Fi movement, providing users with more than just a financial incentive to hold and trade the token. This dual approach—meme coin fun paired with real-world utility—offers a fresh take on what meme coins can achieve. The Future Looks Promising for GoodEgg (GEGG) With a clear roadmap that includes the development of a full-scale dating platform, staking mechanisms, and a wider pool of NFTs, GoodEgg (GEGG is more than just another meme coin. The token’s price of $0.00015 during presale is a reflection of the strong interest it has garnered from investors, including those who have previously backed Dogecoin (DOGE). As the GoodEgg (GEGG) presale progresses, the token is set to become a major player in the meme coin ecosystem, especially with its focus on creating a rewarding social experience for users. The combination of entertainment, engagement, and financial reward gives GoodEgg (GEGG) an edge over traditional meme coins, attracting a broad spectrum of investors. Final Thoughts: GoodEgg (GEGG) as a New Meme Coin Challenger While Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to develop its infrastructure and aims for greater scalability with Project Sakura, GoodEgg (GEGG) is emerging as a challenger in the meme coin space with its innovative “social scoring system.” Priced attractively at $0.00015 during its presale, GoodEgg (GEGG) has captured the attention of Dogecoin (DOGE)investors and new entrants to the crypto market. As both projects continue to develop, the rivalry between Dogecoin (DOGE) and GoodEgg (GEGG may push the boundaries of what meme coins can offer, ultimately benefiting investors who are looking for both fun and utility in the crypto space. Keep an eye on GoodEgg (GEGG) as it carves out its place in this rapidly evolving market.

33461831,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641146,1726051840,"Dogecoin 1.79% Slow Movement Keeps Holders In Suspense, GoogEgg (GEGG) Becomes Crypto’s Favorite Meme","In the rapidly shifting cryptocurrency market, meme coins have a unique ability to capture investor interest, often riding waves of sentiment and social media buzz. Dogecoin has long been the leader of this movement, but with its recent slow growth of 1.79%, investors are left wondering what comes next. Meanwhile, GoodEgg (GEGG), the first Social-Fi dating coin, is quickly becoming a favorite in the meme coin sector, drawing attention with its unique virtual dating ecosystem and strong community support. Dogecoin’s Recent Performance: Slower but Steady In the past few days, Dogecoin (DOGE) has maintained a slower upward trajectory, with a 1.79% increase. While this movement is modest compared to previous explosive growth, it still places Dogecoin (DOGE) among the top-performing meme coins. This steady rise can be attributed to a combination of factors, including a broader market uplift driven by Bitcoin and a tweet from Elon Musk. The tweet, which featured Musk behind a sign reading “D.O.G.E.” for the “Department of Government Efficiency,” once again fueled speculation around Dogecoin (DOGE) and its potential for further growth. As a result, Dogecoin (DOGE) saw an influx of investments, with data showing an 800% increase in net inflows. The token’s price jumped from $0.089 to $0.1036, a notable 16% rise. However, many investors are cautious, wondering whether Dogecoin (DOGE) can sustain this momentum, especially given Musk-related price movements’ history of being short-lived. GoodEgg (GEGG): A Meme Coin with Social-Fi Utility While Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to hold its position as a top meme coin, GoodEgg (GEGG) has emerged as a promising alternative. GoodEgg (GEGG) stands out by offering more than just speculative gains—it combines the playful nature of meme coins with the utility of a virtual dating platform. With its Social-Fi approach, users can earn $GEGG tokens by participating in dating activities, unlocking NFTs, and progressing through levels in a gamified experience. GoodEgg (GEGG) has quickly gained a dedicated community, and its presale has seen strong interest, with over 2.4 billion $GEGG tokens sold at the current price of 0.00015 USDT. Investors are also taking advantage of a 15% bonus on all purchases, further boosting the project’s growth. Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on hype, GoodEgg (GEGG) offers real-world utility through its dating platform, making it a favorite among those looking for long-term gains in the meme coin space. A Unique Ecosystem for Long-Term Success What sets GoodEgg (GEGG) apart from other meme coins is its well-rounded ecosystem, which is designed to offer a sustainable and rewarding experience for its users. With a roadmap that includes the launch of a full-fledged dating platform, gamified features, and a secure environment backed by blockchain technology, GoodEgg aims to redefine how people interact both socially and financially. The $GEGG token is built on the Ethereum (ERC20) network, making it highly accessible and scalable. The project’s developers have ensured that the platform is secure and transparent, with audits from leading security firms to bolster investor confidence. As the platform grows, users will not only enjoy its social benefits but also capitalize on the financial opportunities presented by staking, governance participation, and earning rewards through in-game achievements. By merging real-world social interaction with the benefits of cryptocurrency, GoodEgg (GEGG) is positioning itself as a serious contender in the meme coin space, offering both fun and long-term value. Can Musk’s influence out pace the current bearish market? Despite its slow movement, Dogecoin (DOGE) remains a critical player in the meme coin ecosystem. Its rise has often paved the way for other meme coins to thrive, and this time is no different. In the wake of Dogecoin (DOGE)’s modest rise, the entire meme coin market has seen an influx of investment. The total market capitalization of meme tokens grew from $34.91 billion to $38.84 billion, largely driven by Dogecoin (DOGE) and other rising tokens. However, questions remain about how long this bullish sentiment will last. Historically, trends driven by Elon Musk’s tweets tend to be short-lived, leading some investors to search for new projects with lasting potential. GoodEgg (GEGG) is well-positioned to capture this interest, especially as investors look for meme coins with utility beyond short-term price spikes. The Future of GoodEgg and Dogecoin As Dogecoin (DOGE) continues its slow and steady rise, many investors are keeping an eye on whether it can break through key resistance levels. Currently trading around $0.1036, Dogecoin (DOGE) is approaching critical points that could trigger further price movements. If the token surpasses the $0.111 resistance level, it could spark a rally toward $0.142 or even $0.175, marking a significant recovery for the meme coin. Meanwhile, GoodEgg (GEGG) is gaining momentum as the first Social-Fi dating coin, blending cryptocurrency with real-world connections. With plans to release its full dating platform in the coming phases of its roadmap, GoodEgg (GEGG) offers a unique opportunity for investors who want more than just a fun meme coin. The token’s combination of social impact and virtual dating provides a fresh angle in the meme coin space, setting it apart from traditional meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE). For those looking to get in early, GoodEgg (GEGG)‘s presale is live, and the project is attracting attention from across the crypto community. As both Dogecoin (DOGE) and GoodEgg (GEGG) continue to evolve, investors will be watching closely to see which coin leads the next big movement in the meme coin sector. In conclusion, while Dogecoin (DOGE)’s 1.79% slow movement keeps its holders in suspense, GoodEgg (GEGG) has quickly become a favorite meme coin, offering a unique blend of social interaction and crypto rewards. Both tokens are worth keeping an eye on as they continue to shape the future of the meme coin market.

While Dogecoin climbed by 7% following Musk’s latest tweet, GoodEgg seized the moment and skyrocketed, emerging as a standout in the meme coin market. But GoodEgg isn’t just riding the wave—it’s bringing innovation with its unique blend of meme culture, AI technology, and a Play-2-Date platform. Dogecoin’s Musk-Driven Surge Elon Musk continues to play a pivotal role in the cryptocurrency market, particularly with Dogecoin (DOGE). On September 10, 2024, Musk stirred up excitement with a playful tweet referring to Dogecoin as the official mascot of the “Department of Government Efficiency.” This lighthearted endorsement sent Dogecoin soaring by 7% within 24 hours and sparked a frenzy across social media platforms like X, Reddit, and Telegram. This excitement had a ripple effect on the meme coin market, and GoodEgg (GEGG) was a key beneficiary. GoodEgg, a meme coin with a purpose, caught the attention of investors who were already captivated by Musk’s impact on Dogecoin. With its innovative approach that merges social impact, dating, and crypto, GoodEgg began to attract attention as a major player in the market. GoodEgg: A Meme Coin with a Purpose While Dogecoin (DOGE) is renowned for its community-driven fun, GoodEgg (GEGG) adds a new layer of innovation to the meme coin space. Positioned as a “Play 2 Date” token, GoodEgg merges cryptocurrency with virtual dating. Users can earn $GEGG tokens by engaging in dating activities, unlocking NFTs, and leveling up in a gamified environment. This combination of dating and cryptocurrency makes GoodEgg a standout. The 187% surge in GoodEgg’s price wasn’t just because of Dogecoin’s rally. GoodEgg is also gaining traction due to its real-world utility and potential for social impact. As a decentralized dating platform, GoodEgg empowers users to connect, earn rewards, and engage in meaningful social interactions, all while offering an innovative way to monetize dating. The Cardinals Protocol and What It Means for Dogecoin While Dogecoin (DOGE) has long been a favorite in the meme coin sector, its recent surge wasn’t just about Musk’s tweet. The Dogecoin Foundation recently introduced the Cardinals Protocol, a new system designed to enhance the scalability and functionality of Dogecoin (DOGE). The Cardinals Protocol aims to bundle transactions, reduce fees, and increase transaction speeds, which could solve many of the scalability issues faced by Bitcoin and Ethereum. This new protocol offers Dogecoin (DOGE) the potential for long-term growth, giving it a competitive edge in the cryptocurrency space. More than just a meme coin, Dogecoin (DOGE) is evolving into a more efficient and scalable blockchain, with the potential for DeFi applications, staking, and yield farming. These developments ensure that Dogecoin (DOGE) remains relevant beyond the influence of social media and celebrity endorsements, driving sustained growth in its ecosystem. How Dogecoin’s Rise Benefited GoodEgg As Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to dominate the meme coin sector with its newfound utility and scalability improvements, coins like GoodEgg (GEGG) are gaining momentum as part of a broader trend. The GoodEgg (GEGG) surge, which saw the token jump by 187%, was boosted by the increased visibility that Dogecoin (DOGE)brought to the meme coin market. GoodEgg (GEGG) takes the concept of a meme coin further by adding a social layer—its virtual dating platform is built to connect users, foster relationships, and reward participants with crypto incentives. This Play 2 Date model allows users to earn tokens and NFTs as they engage with the platform, creating a unique blend of fun and financial opportunity. The Future for GoodEgg and Dogecoin With Dogecoin (DOGE) leading the charge, thanks to its Cardinals Protocol and Musk’s ongoing support, it’s clear that the meme coin market still has a lot of room for growth. GoodEgg (GEGG), with its innovative approach to dating and social impact, has positioned itself as a serious contender in this space. As Dogecoin (DOGE) approaches key resistance levels such as $0.111 and potentially rallies to $0.142, investors will be watching closely to see if the rally can continue. Meanwhile, GoodEgg (GEGG) is proving that it can capture attention by offering more than just speculative gains—it’s a meme coin with a purpose. For those interested in riding this wave of meme coin growth, GoodEgg’s (GEGG) presale is live, and investors are taking advantage of a 15% bonus on all purchases. The GoodEgg (GEGG) community is growing, and its unique blend of social impact and cryptocurrency offers an exciting alternative to traditional meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE). As always in the world of cryptocurrency, nothing is certain. But one thing is clear: GoodEgg (GEGG) is leveraging the momentum from Dogecoin (DOGE) to build something that could become a major player in the meme coin ecosystem. Keep an eye on both GoodEgg (GEGG) and Dogecoin (DOGE) as they continue to make waves in the crypto world.

33460223,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641062,1726048844,Bullish Signals Emerge For Ethereum: Price Rises Above Downward Trendline And Key MA Levels,"The cryptocurrency market is showing tentative signs of recovery, with leading assets like Ethereum (ETH) making modest gains in the past 24-hours. Following a sharp decline that saw ETH’s price plummet to $2,154 last Friday, the digital asset is now nearing the $2,400 mark, sparking optimism among investors. Signs Of An Imminent Breakout To The Upside? In a recent social media post on X (formerly Twitter), Market expert Jesse Olson has highlighted several bullish indicators on Ethereum’s 8-hour chart, suggesting a potential continuation of this recovery. One key signal is a pending buy indication, which could facilitate a rebound to previously lost levels if macroeconomic conditions align favorably. Olson also points out a bullish divergence on the 8-hour chart, which typically signals a shift in momentum toward the upside. Additionally, a potential reversal candle has appeared, indicating that if the current momentum persists, it could bode well for bullish investors looking to capitalize on this recovery. Related Reading: Bitcoin Shakeout Ahead: Analysts Predict Final Dip Before Bull Run Resumes In addition, the expert highlights that the Ethereum price is currently reclaiming the 200-week moving average (MA), along with recent trends in market indicators. The price has also broken above a downward trendline that has been in place since late August. However, sustaining this recovery will be crucial for validating these bullish signals. If Ethereum fails to maintain its upward trajectory, it could lead to a retest of lower support levels or result in price consolidation between the $2,100 and $2,300 range. Ethereum Price Nears Key Resistance Crypto analyst Daan Crypto Trades has echoed this sentiment, noting that Ethereum has bounced solidly from support levels. However, he cautions that trading within the $2,100 to $2,850 range may remain volatile. Daan contends in a social media post, that a consolidation above $2,850 would mark a significant bullish development for Ethereum, confirming a breakout from the current downtrend and setting sights on the key $3,000 level, which has not been reached since early August. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Surges Past $130 Resistance As Funding Rate Signals Bullish Momentum As of now, ETH trades at the top side of the descending channel at $2,383, recording gains of nearly 2% in the 24-hour time frame, according to CoinGecko data. This surge, however, is offset by a drop in trading volume for the second largest cryptocurrency on the market, which amounted to $12 billion over the past 48 hours, specifically a 15% drop compared to Monday’s trading session. Additionally, in longer time frames, ETH’s price is still suffering from the sharp declines witnessed over the past month, posting losses of 2.6% and nearly 7% in the fourteen and thirty day time frames, respectively.

On Monday, Apple announced ""Apple Intelligence,"" foraying into the artificial intelligence sector.  Native cryptocurrencies of blockchain endeavors supposedly involved with artificial intelligence (AI) outshone the broader market after iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) showcased its efforts to bring the technology to its smartphones.  AI-focused decentralized blockchain platform Internet Computer Protocol's ICP token is about 10% higher on a 24-hour basis, the best-performing token among the 100 biggest cryptocurrencies by market value, according to data source Coingecko.

Meanwhile, market leaders bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}} and other prominent cryptocurrencies nursed losses after pro-crypto U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump's poor showing during a debate with rival Kamala Harris. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), a measure of the broader crypto market, lost 0.7% in the same period.  Apple's ""It's Glowtime"" event on Monday focused on bringing AI capabilities to the smartphone. The Nasdaq-listed company said it would introduce AI features including writing tools, smarter Siri responses and advanced photo and video editing facilities under the banner of Apple Intelligence. The features will be available in the iOS 18.1 update and beyond.  The key feature of Apple Intelligence is that it will be a software development kit (SDK), allowing developers to build apps using on-device generative models while enjoying security and privacy features in Private Cloud Compute.  The event did not mention crypto or blockchain. Still, market participants are confident Apple Intelligence will have a positive effect on all things AI, including blockchain projects.  ""Just like everyone's buzzing about Apple Intelligence in phones now, soon it'll be all about crypto,"" Pranav Maheshwari, an engineer at the Graph Protocol, said on X.

Jefferies said September could be another difficult month for the miners as bitcoin remains below $60K and the network hashrate continues to advance.  Mining economics may be moving in the wrong direction but operational efficiency is improving, the bank said.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} mining was much less profitable in August than July as the average bitcoin price fell over 4% and the average network hashrate rose about 2.7%, investment bank Jefferies said in a research report on Wednesday.  Miner's average daily revenue per exahash fell by 11.8% from the month previous as a result, the report said.  ""September is shaping up to be another difficult month as BTC remains below $60K and the network hashrate continues to climb,"" analysts Jonathan Petersen and Joe Dickstein wrote. The Bitcoin hashrate is a proxy for competition in the industry and mining difficulty.  Jefferies notes that there were less days of extreme heat this summer, which meant better uptime for the largest miners. The bitcoin mined by Marathon Digital (MARA) last month implies roughly 88% uptime, compared to 75% in August last year.  For the ten largest bitcoin miners that the bank tracks, implied uptime last month was around 83% versus 76% a year ago and 79% in August 2022.  ""While mining economics may be moving in the wrong direction, operational efficiency is improving,"" the authors wrote.  U.S.-listed mining companies mined a lower share of new bitcoin in August than the month prior, the bank said, and were 19.9% of the total network as the ""public players brought on new capacity faster than the network hashrate increased.""  Marathon mined the most tokens last month, with 673 bitcoin, the report noted. CleanSpark (CLSK) was second with 478 BTC.  Marathon's installed hashrate remains the largest of the group, followed by Riot Platforms (RIOT), the report added.

Investors included Distributed Global with significant participation from Hashkey Capital, Folius Ventures, Stellar Development Foundation, and TIBAS Ventures.  Huma merged with cross-border payments firm Arf earlier this year and the two are projected to hit a combined $10 billion in payments-financing transactions next year.  Huma Finance closed a $38 million investment round to boost its payment-financing (PayFi) platform built on tokenized real-world assets (RWA).  The round comprised $10 million of equity investment and $28 million in yield-bearing RWAs on the San Francisco-based company's platform.  The equity component was led by venture capital firm Distributed Global, with significant participation from Hashkey Capital, Folius Ventures, Stellar Development Foundation and TIBAS Ventures, the venture arm of İşbank, Turkey's largest private bank. For the RWA component, Stellar Development Foundation was the largest participant, dedicating $10 million.  The real-world assets were multitranche bonds of varying maturities wrapped into exchange-traded products issued by Switzerland-based Arf Capital under Swiss DLT laws, Erbil Karaman, co-founder of Huma, said in an email interview.  The company said the investment will help expand the platform to the Solana blockchain and Stellar's Soroban smart-contract network in the coming months.  Tokenized RWAs are among the fastest growing applications for blockchain technology, with global financial institutions and digital asset firms racing to bring traditional instruments such as bonds, credit and funds onto distributed ledgers. The process could bring operational efficiencies, faster settlement and increased transparency.  The PayFi platform aims to address the liquidity needs of trade financing using blockchain technology, and claims to offer more efficient, more accessible services than traditional alternatives.  Earlier this year, Huma Finance merged with Arf to focus on tokenization of RWAs, with both operating independently under a joint holding entity to offer a full-stack tokenized-asset platform. The two companies combined are projected to hit $10 billion in payments-financing transactions next year, Huma said.

Bitcoin Has Recovered Back Towards The $57,000 Level Bitcoin witnessed a plunge a few days ago, but it has started this new week with bullish momentum, seemingly rejuvenated as its price has recovered to $57,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Surges Above $57,000, But Investors Still Shorting: Fuel For More Rise? The below chart shows what the coin’s recent performance has looked like. This 4% jump in the last 24 hours has completely retraced the price above plummet. Perhaps more importantly, the surge has helped the asset gain some distance over an important pricing level of an on-chain model. BTC Hasn’t Yet Lost This MVRV Pricing Band Support Level In a post on X, analyst Ali Martinez had yesterday discussed how BTC was retesting a support level part of the MVRV Extreme Deviation Pricing Bands model. As its name suggests, the model is based on the popular Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. This indicator tells us how the value held by the Bitcoin investors (that is, the market cap) compares against the value they put into the asset (the realized cap). When the ratio has a value greater than 1, the investors are in a state of net profit. On the other hand, it being under the threshold implies the dominance of loss in the market. The MVRV Extreme Deviation Pricing Bands model takes this metric’s mean value and relates standard deviations (SDs) to the price of the cryptocurrency. Below is the chart for the model that the analyst shared yesterday. As displayed in the graph, Bitcoin had been retesting the $54,200 level yesterday, which corresponded to the price at which the MVRV ratio would attain the same level as its historical mean. In the scenario that BTC had found rejection at this level and had dropped under it, the next important level from the perspective of the model would have been $41,100. At this level, BTC’s MVRV ratio would assume a value of -0.5 SD from its mean. Related Reading: Ethereum Bullish Signal: Adoption Hits Four-Month High Rate Ali had noted that BTC could have, therefore, been at risk of facing a correction to this level. With the recovery in the last 24 hours, though, the immediate threat of such a drop may no longer loom over the cryptocurrency’s head. In terms of potential resistance levels ahead, the next Bitcoin MVRV Pricing Band is located at around $67,400, so there is still quite a while to go before a retest of it can happen.

42417284,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTXqEX,1726039575,"Bitcoin Slides, Yen Gains as Trump-Harris Debate Disappoints Markets","Asian markets and U.S. stock futures experienced a downturn, with Bitcoin dropping over 2% to $56,300, reflecting a risk-off sentiment in financial markets following the presidential debate where Kamala Harris was perceived to outperform Donald Trump.  Dogecoin led declines among major cryptocurrencies, while Trump-themed political finance tokens saw significant losses, contrasting with a gain in Harris-themed tokens, indicating market sentiment aligning with the debate's perceived outcome.  It's a risk-off day in Asia after U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris supposedly outshined former President and pro-crypto Republican candidate Donald Trump in the second presidential debate.  Bitcoin {{BTC}}, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, fell over 2% to $56,300, with the CoinDesk 20 Index, the broader market gauge, falling nearly 2.5%, according to CoinDesk data.  Dogecoin {{DOGE}} led losses among major tokens with a 4% slide in the past 24 hours, CoinGecko data shows, while xrp {{XRP}}, Solana’s SOL, ether {{ETH}} and BNB Chain’s BNB remained little changed.  Meanwhile, bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) extended inflows to a second-straight day after a record losing streak, bagging $117 million led by Fidelity’s FBTC product.  Early this year, Trump began courting the crypto community, often touted as single-issue voters, establishing bitcoin and the wider crypto market as bet on his presidency. Since then, traders have closely watched Trump and Harris' odds on the betting platform Polymarket.  According to Polymarket traders, Harris won the first presidential debate between her and Trump. Trump had debated Joe Biden earlier, before the President dropped out of the race and handed the reins to Harris.  In traditional markets, futures tied to the S&P 500 lost 0.4%, and Chinese stocks fell to a seven-month low as Trump defended trade tariffs during the debate, saying they would not result in higher prices for the U.S. consumers.  The anti-risk Japanese yen strengthened to 140.70 per U.S. dollar, the highest since January, appreciating beyond the early August level of 141.68. The yen picked up a strong bid in late July as the Bank of Japan hiked interest rates for the first time in decades, triggering an unwinding of the risk-on yen carry trades.  Trump-themed tokens deep in the red  While Polymarket bettors have the election tied to 49-49, polls say that Kamala Harris won this debate.  Meanwhile, Trump-themed Political Finance (PoliFi) tokens are hurting, with the MAGA (TRUMP) token down 11.7%, Solana’s Doland Tremp (TREMP) token down 27%, and the MAGA Hat (MAGA) token down 23.5%.  Meanwhile, the Harris-themed ‘Kamala Horris’ (KAMA) token is up 7.6%.  The entire PoliFi category market cap is down 8.8% to just over $540 million.  Back on Polymarket, bettors are putting their money on a 56% chance of another debate happening, and a 27% chance that Trump fires his campaign manager. Immediately after the debate wrapped, Trump made an appearance on Sean Hannity’s Fox News show, which observers say is a sign that the campaign felt the debate performance wasn’t that strong.",NEGATIVE,BTC | SOL,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | SOL,"Shaurya Malwa, Sam Reynolds, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/11/bitcoin-slides-yen-gains-as-trump-harris-debate-disappoints-markets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f0ecf8d83d5986faae2c10987fa64159f14a8ceb-5767x3845.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

33454303,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641030,1726038059,Is Bitcoin Heading For A Bear Market? Analysts Weigh In On The Price Struggles,"Bitcoin market performance has been underwhelming since its peak above $73,000 in March 2024. Instead of building on this rally, the top crypto has faced continued consolidation coupled with a series of declines, frustrating many investors. Currently, Bitcoin is down 22.7% from its March high, raising concerns over whether this signals the start of a deeper bear market. The decline has shaken confidence, with market analysts now questioning the near-term outlook for the digital asset. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Could Extend Gains: Will Bulls Stay in Control? Bitcoin Price Continous To Struggle, Why? Analysts from IntoTheBlock, a market intelligence platform, have recently shared insights on X, reflecting the changing sentiment. In a post uploaded earlier today, the analyst noted: Bitcoin’s price remains under pressure, with no significant upward momentum. The market, once hopeful for a rally, now faces growing uncertainty as both retail and institutional interest appear to be dwindling. The analysts asked, “is this just a quiet phase or the start of a prolonged bear market?” To answer this question, IntoTheBlock first assessed Bitcoin price struggles and the factors contributing to the lackluster price movement. Mentioning “macro landscape,” the market intelligence platform disclosed that the possibility of a global recession looms large, creating a cautious outlook for risk assets like Bitcoin. They noted that although many expect rate cuts soon, these measures may take time to affect Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies positively. Meanwhile, until that happens, the broader macro environment will likely continue to pressure market sentiment and investor confidence. Furthermore, IntoTheBlock touched on the interest in cryptocurrencies, which has also been declining sharply in recent months. According to the market intelligence platform, search trends related to Bitcoin and other digital assets have significantly decreased, reflecting a drop in public interest. Even app rankings for major crypto exchanges like Coinbase have fallen, suggesting fewer users engage with the market. This trend has extended to on-chain metrics, where the number of new Bitcoin addresses remains low, indicating a slowdown in market participation. Should You Panic? While the current downturn has raised concerns, analysts from IntoTheBlock see potential parallels to Bitcoin’s price action in 2019. They noted: Historical Bitcoin halving cycles suggest it could be a post-halving dip, something we’ve seen before. Parallels to 2019: Interestingly, many analysts point out the current phase mirrors 2019, where the market also slowed down after a (local) high. Back then, the market experienced a prolonged consolidation before turning bullish again. Could we be on the same path? IntoTheBlock further highlighted that “other cycle data tells a different story.” The market intelligence platform noted that in recent weeks, the balances of long-term Bitcoin holders have hit new lows, echoing post-peak trends from previous market cycles. According to IntoTheBlock, this could signal a “prolonged cooldown” phase for Bitcoin, potentially delaying any significant price recovery. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Break $100K By 2025?

Analyst Suggests Time To Accumulate Will End Soon,"With only a few weeks before Q4 begins, investors and market watchers remain vigilant of the market’s performance. Many expect the next quarter will kickstart the rally’s second leg up, suggesting that most altcoins will explode in the coming months. Several analysts are bullish about the upcoming performances, hinting that the time to accumulate these cryptocurrencies is near its end and that the alt season is near. Related Reading: Crypto Investor Loses $16 Million Amid Friend.tech’s Controversy And Token Crash Investors’ Last Call Before The Altseason Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have taken a hit throughout Q3’s market retraces. Since July 1, the flagship cryptocurrency’s price fell more than 10%, while the “King of altcoins” plunged by over 30%. Nonetheless, several altcoins have led the market bounces amid the volatility, displaying a remarkable performance during the shakeouts. Many of the alts have outperformed their BTC pairs, as crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe stated. Per the post, many technical indicators show that “the Bitcoin pairs of many of the altcoins have been crawling up.” The analyst also considers that BTC and alts have bottomed out and that a market’s next moves will “be great.” Moreover, altcoins’ dominance seems “ready to take the spotlight.” Analyst and trader Titan of Crypto recently noted that Bitcoin dominance “is on the verge of printing a new lower high.” To the analyst, this could trigger the Altseason between Q4 2024 and Q1 2025, which could last until mid-2025. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Alex Clay suggested that investors’ chance to accumulate alts might end soon as “Uptober” approaches. To the analyst, the second correction wave of the Elliot Impulse Wave is over. As a result, cryptocurrencies, excluding BTC and ETH, are ready to begin the third bullish wave. Clay highlighted that the second correction wave displayed a bullish flag pattern. Additionally, he noted that altcoins’ market capitalization has been supported “at the strong confluence of EMA 100 + MA 200 + Key zone.” Based on this, he forecasted the sector’s mid-term target could hit a market capitalization of $1.3 trillion by May 2025 before the fourth wave. Clay also predicted a “conservative” long-term target of a $1.65 trillion market cap for the final impulse wave. Will Altcoins Hit $2 Trillion? Miky Bull highlighted Altcoins’, including ETH, market cap impulse. To the trader, the cryptocurrencies’ market cap is getting ready to break from the bullish flash pattern, potentially targeting a mark above the $1.8 trillion level. Miky previously suggested that the alts chart follows “the 2020 blueprint.” However, he considers they will differentiate by the duration of the re-accumulation phase, as he deems this cycle’s expansion will be “longer and huge.” Related Reading: Analysts Say Bitcoin Will Break $90,000 In Q4 2024 But This Must Happen First Another crypto analyst, Moustache, noted that alts have been in a 2-year-long cup and handle pattern, which is considered extremely bullish. The pattern suggests that altcoins’ market cap will significantly increase from the handle lows. To the trader, if this scenario plays out, alts target a $2.14 trillion market cap by 2025. As of this writing, altcoins sit at a market cap of $558 billion, a 10% decrease since Q3 began.

Despite her role in propping up FTX and Alameda, Ellison cooperated with prosecutors, FTX's bankruptcy estate and creditors, the filing said.  A presentence report similarly recommended no prison term or fine, the filing said.  Former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison should be sentenced to time served and supervised release for her role in FTX's operation and subsequent collapse, her attorneys said in a filing late Tuesday night.  Ellison, one of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried's top lieutenants, testified against him at his trial last year, where he was convicted on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy. Ellison had previously pleaded guilty to fraud tied to FTX's operation shortly after the exchange filed for bankruptcy in the fall of 2022. In Tuesday night's filing, her attorneys noted that the Probation Department had filed a presentence report recommending three years of supervised release due to her ""extraordinary cooperation with the government"" and the character testimonials accompanying the submission. The presentence report also recommended that Ellison not be fined.  ""[Ellison] poses no risk of recidivism and presents no threat to public safety. It would therefore promote respect for the law to grant leniency in recognition of [Ellison's] early disclosure of the crimes, her unmitigated acceptance of responsibility for them, and – most importantly – her extensive cooperation with the government,"" the filing said.  The document outlined Ellison's childhood, college and early career, including meeting Bankman-Fried at Jane Street and eventually joining Alameda Research, Bankman-Fried's first company.  Ellison began taking Adderall and had an on-again, off-again relationship with Bankman-Fried during her time at Alameda (which the document described as Bankman-Fried repeatedly ghosting her), the attorneys said. As part of her role at Alameda, she became isolated from friends when she moved to Hong Kong shortly before COVID lockdowns shuttered travel between there and the U.S.  The sentencing submission was accompanied by diary entries, statements about her cooperation with FTX's bankruptcy estate and letters from former colleagues, friends and family. Some of these names have been redacted, though Inner City Press has requested that the court at least allow a hearing to argue for unredacting these names. Ellison's attorneys said in an initial filing that the people who wrote the letters are at risk of harassment or doxing, and at least one letter said it was written by another former Alameda Research employee.  John J. Ray III, the CEO of the FTX bankruptcy estate, wrote that Ellison's assistance was ""valuable"" in helping his team take over the exchange as it was falling apart, and that the estate was close to a settlement with Ellison where she would ""turn over ... substantially all of her remaining assets"" and continue assisting the bankruptcy team in restructuring FTX and its affiliated entities.  Similarly, attorneys who filed class action lawsuits against FTX's former executives said she ""provided valuable assistance"" to help them recover funds for FTX's creditors. Robert Cleary, the court-appointed examiner, also wrote a (brief) message saying Ellison was helpful.  Ellison's diary entries – a select few pages anyway – also lay out her thought process during her time at Alameda, describing her mood, how work and her relationship with Bankman-Fried affected her and her thoughts on how to improve her life (taking a day off work, going outside, keeping in touch with friends and reducing her Adderall dosage, among other possible remedies).  Ellison is scheduled to be sentenced on Sept. 24, 2024, in the same courthouse where Bankman-Fried went on trial. Fellow FTX executives Nishad Singh and Gary Wang will also be sentenced this year, in October and November.

Related Reading: Crypto Market Stuck In A Rut?

The current consolidation looks a lot like what happened last year when Bitcoin stayed in a range for several months. The first bullish MACD crossover gave a weak signal, causing a short term pump, but price couldn’t break out of the range.… pic.twitter.com/09osi0GEfF — Mags (@thescalpingpro) September 10, 2024 Mags highlighted that last year, the first bullish MACD crossover was followed by a short-term rally, but the price failed to break out of its range. However, the second bullish MACD crossover led to a significant breakout and subsequent price surge. Mags believes we could witness the same scenario again, potentially setting the stage for a new ATH. The analyst particularly noted: We might see the same pattern play out again. The first signal was weak and created a short-term bottom, but the second one might lead to a real breakout and a new ATH. $73,000 And Beyond While Mags used the MACD indicator to gauge how near a major Bitcoin rally might be, another crypto analyst, Javon Marks, has also recently shared his outlook on the crypto. However, his view connected more to a technical chart pattern than an indicator. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Repeat History?

Despite Harris' performance, the two candidates are effectively tied in the Polymarket contract for who will win the actual election, with Harris' odds increasing slightly during the course of the debate.  Read More: Bitcoin Slides, Yen Gains as Trump-Harris Debate Disappoints Markets  This is the second presidential debate in the 2024 election. Harris' campaign called for a third debate – which would be the second between Harris and Trump – after Tuesday's event ended. It's also the second debate that did not delve into crypto, or even general technology or finance issues beyond a section on the economy.  Trump, as he has been doing in recent weeks, touted the benefit of tariffs during his time on the stand, saying he would have ""substantial tariffs.""  Harris pushed back, saying Trump left the Biden administration with a trade deficit, ""one of the highest we've seen in history.""  As with an earlier debate between Trump and President Joe Biden before the latter dropped out of the race, fact-checkers including CNN reporter Daniel Dale said Trump made more inaccurate statements than Harris. At one point Trump claimed – falsely, according to the Wall Street Journal – that migrants are ""eating the dogs"" in Springfield, Ohio. (That remark inspired a few new memecoins on the token launchpad Pump.fun, including EATING DOGS AND CATS.)  Following the debate, musician Taylor Swift endorsed Harris, saying Harris ""fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion.""  Polymarket's busy night  Bettors had a busy night on Polymarket, after the night began with an unexpected handshake between the candidates.  The market had pegged the chance of a handshake at roughly 30%, with around $360,000 on the line. Trump and Harris shook hands as the night began – something that didn’t happen since the first 2016 debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton.  Bettors were quite skeptical that crypto or bitcoin would get mentioned during the evening, placing the chances of it happening at 26% for Trump and 14% for Harris.  One user going by the handle ""trumpisreal"" won over $10,000 in the stablecoin USDC by correctly guessing that Trump would mention “Springfield” and “Cat,” a reference to debunked claims that Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, are eating pets. The debate moderator pointed out that city officials said there was no evidence of that happening.  On the Harris side, bettors took home money early in the evening when the Democratic candidate mentioned “Project 2025” and “Artificial Intelligence” in the first moments of the debate.  Bettors are confident that polls will say that Harris had won the debate, putting it at 98%, and giving a 59% chance that Harris will be the Polymarket election contract favorite the day after the debate. Harris will be the confirmed debate winner on the contract if an Ipsos/538 opinion poll taken the same day indicates she had a better performance.

Crypto has become a major talking point ahead of the elections, and experts like Bernstein analysts have also suggested that the winner of the polls will determine Bitcoin’s future trajectory. What The Bitcoin Price Will Be By 2030 If Trump Or Harris Wins Thomas mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin will reach $1 million by 2030, whether Donald Trump or Kamala Harris wins. The analyst suggested that the outcome of the US presidential elections in November wouldn’t stop the flagship crypto from reaching its full potential. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Dogecoin Will Rise 3,600% To $3.7, Here’s When Crypto commentators have continued to make price predictions for Bitcoin based on the upcoming elections. This is understandable, especially with Trump presenting himself as the ‘Crypto President’ to win over crypto voters. Based on his pro-crypto stance, Bernstein analysts recently predicted that Bitcoin could rise to as high as $90,000 in the fourth quarter of this year if Trump emerges victorious. In June, Geoffrey Kendrick, head of forex and digital assets research at Standard Chartered, predicted that Bitcoin would rise to $100,000 before the elections and that the flagship crypto could reach $150,000 by year-end if Trump becomes the next US president. On the other hand, not much has been said about Bitcoin’s future trajectory if Harris wins the elections, as the current US Vice President remains tight-lipped about her crypto stance. Harris recently released her official policy statement, which does not mention crypto or Bitcoin specifically. This has made the crypto community question where she stands concerning cryptocurrencies. The Vice President’s silence about Bitcoin is more concerning, considering she is part of the current administration, which has continued to clamp down on crypto firms, primarily through the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Crypto Community Awaits Debate Between Trump And Harris The crypto community awaits the US presidential debate between Trump and Harris. If both candidates discuss their plans for the crypto industry or crypto-related policies they intend to implement if elected, it could be a significant moment for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Related Reading: Ethereum Forms Falling Wedge Pattern That Could Send Price To $3,000 It is worth mentioning that crypto wasn’t discussed during the first US presidential debate between Trump and President Joe Biden in June when the latter was still the presidential nominee for the Democratic party. However, this time will likely be different, seeing how more involved crypto stakeholders have become in the election campaign since then. Ripple’s co-founder Chris Larsen was one of eighty-eight corporate leaders who recently signed a letter endorsing Harris ahead of the debate.

Bitcoin Funding Rate Is Still Negative On Major Exchanges According to data from the analytics firm Santiment, investors have been shorting BTC for the last few days. The indicator of interest here is the “Funding Rate,” which keeps track of the periodic fee that the derivatives contract traders on a given exchange are paying each other right now. Related Reading: Ethereum Bullish Signal: Adoption Hits Four-Month High Rate When the value of this metric is positive, it means the long contract holders are paying a premium to the short investors in order to keep their positions. Such a trend implies a bullish sentiment is shared by the majority. On the other hand, the indicator being negative suggests the shorts are outweighing the longs, so a bearish mentality can be assumed to be the dominant one in the sector. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Funding Rate for two platforms, Binance and BitMEX, over the past month: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin Funding Rate on both of these platforms had achieved large negative levels around the price bottom a few days back. This means that derivatives users had been expecting the decline of the cryptocurrency to continue further. The bet of these Binance and BitMEX traders clearly didn’t work out, though, as the coin has been going up since then. In fact, the liquidation of these investors is likely what has facilitated the rebound from the bottom. Bitcoin has continued this surge during the past 24 hours, breaking past the $57,000 level. According to data from CoinGlass, this BTC surge and the uplift across the rest of the sector have caused almost $123 million in liquidations. Out of these, over $88 million of the liquidations have involved the short investors, with Bitcoin shorts alone making up for around $34 million of the flush. As displayed in the Funding Rate chart, though, the metric has still continued to be negative on these platforms, suggesting that bearish speculators haven’t let up even after this heavy beating. Related Reading: Dogecoin To $0.15: Analyst Explains What Could Kick Off A Fresh Rally But as it has already happened in this surge so far, these positions could end up finding liquidation, thus fueling the price surge even further. It now remains to be seen if Bitcoin will continue to go contrary to this expectation held by the majority of the derivatives investors or not.

The former executive testified against her boss, Sam Bankman-Fried, during last year's month-long trial, alleging that the FTX founder had directed her to commit fraud and hide FTX and Alameda's true financial situation from lenders. Bankman-Fried was found guilty on all seven charges he faced, and later sentenced to 25 years in prison. Ellison will be the third major figure associated with the collapsed exchange to be sentenced, after FTX Digital Markets CEO Ryan Salame was sentenced to 7.5 years in prison earlier this year.

As of press time, neither the Department of Justice nor Ellison's attorneys have filed sentencing submissions laying out their arguments for how much time she should spend behind bars. However, Ellison's attorneys asked Judge Lewis Kaplan on Monday to allow them to redact certain information from her sentencing memo, including the names of some of her character witnesses, ""certain irrelevant medical information"" and information about her address, partner and groups she volunteers with.  ""Ms. Ellison has been the focus of intense media scrutiny and Internet fascination since the outset of this case, including from Sam Bankman-Fried's repeated efforts to release Ms. Ellison's private information to the media,"" the filing said. ""Because Ms. Ellison's friends should not be subject to harassment and doxing because they have written to the Court, Ms. Ellison seeks leave to redact their names and other identifying information from the publicly filed version of the letters and her sentencing memorandum.""  The medical information Ellison wants to redact includes ""planned and contemplated medical treatments"" in journal entries she intends to attach to her submission, because it's both irrelevant and not formal diagnostic information, the memo continued.  The judge granted the motion on Tuesday, but he opened the door for third-parties to ask for the names of the individuals who write letters in support of Ellison.  ""Motion granted without prejudice to any supported application by a non-party for access. If an application were made, the defendant would have the burden to justify any continued restricted access,"" he said.

33442081,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640960,1726012800,BNB Weekly Active Addresses Surge Over 6% – Is A Rally On The Way?,"Since March, the price of BNB, previously also known as Binance Coin, has barely fallen below $500, despite the broader crypto market downturn. Following heavy losses from major cryptocurrencies, BNB has shown some impressive resistance to the price drop, supported by strong demand. Related Reading: Vitalik Buterin Withdraws 760 ETH As Market Turmoil Strikes Ethereum Despite this strength, the latest BNB price forecast by CoinCodex still estimates the coin could rise by 25% and reach $650 by October 10, 2024. Meanwhile, investor sentiment is bearish, and the Fear & Greed Index also stands at 33, reflecting that uncertainty in the market. This mixed outlook brings up questions about BNB’s near-term trajectory. While there might be a possibility of growth in the long run, short-term conservatism is required, more so from the recent coin volatility and broader market dynamics. BNB’s Sideways Movement And Strong Demand Since March, BNB has moved within a sideways pattern that posts heavy ups and downs. However, after every fall, BNB has strongly rebounded above $500, meaning that there is strong demand for the coin. For instance, on September 6, it fell as low as $470 but later rebounded to trade at $520 at press time. This is also in line with the rising expectations of an altseason, as a decline in Bitcoin dominance tends to boost altcoins like BNB. Investors seem confident that BNB might continue profiting from this trend in a way that it always has historically when stronger demand for alternative cryptocurrencies was triggered. On-Chain Data: Activity And Network Demand Recent on-chain data from Dune Analytics points to both some promising and concerning trends in BNB. The number of active addresses on the Binance Smart Chain increased by 6% week-over-week, indicating that more people are interested in getting on the network. This increase in active addresses did not, however, reflect a similar uptick in transaction volumes, which declined 1.1% over the week, hinting that increased participation has not yet translated into strong network activity. The decline in network fees also reflects reduced activity, which may have an effect on the path that the BNB price may take. To be sure, high network usage has always seen relatively high demand for the BNB historically, and its prolonged depressed activity can cap the upside potential of the coin. A Rally Around The Corner? Some analysts think it could be set up for a run, despite the bearish sentiment and recent price swings, particularly once altseason starts to heat up. Usually, when Bitcoin dominance weakens, that allows other assets to capture market attention and capital, which is where altcoins, especially BNB, tend to do well. While the projection for a 25% gain in price by CoinCodex could be the sort of thing that might suggest that BNB will continue to rise, the short-term prospects for the token remain uncertain. Related Reading: Ether Liquidity Plummets 40% On Exchanges After ETF Debut While the coin did manage to post green days of 47% over the last month, the price volatility of 4.62% still showed risks. The bearish sentiment and market fear, along with mixed network activity, all imply prudence by investors in the immediate future. BNB may very well persist with its resilience and probably grow even more. This crypto asset is one to keep an eye on. But with mixed signals in on-chain data and markets feeling their way cautiously, the risks involved should be considered first before investors dabble into the digital asset. While a rally is most definitely possible, the market has not ended fluctuations just yet, and that short-term volatility may still be an issue.
