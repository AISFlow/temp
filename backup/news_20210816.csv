In higher timeframes, the cryptocurrency records a 70% and 141% profit in the 7 day and monthly chart. Perceived as one of Ethereum&apos;s potential killer ecosystems, Solana continues to grow and attract attention from the crypto space. DeFi investor Daniel Cheung recently published a report on the fundamentals that support further appreciation for SOL&apos;s price. Cheung believes this cryptocurrency offers one of the &apos;best&apos; reward/risk scenarios for any crypto investments and predicted the arrival of the &apos;Solana Summer&apos;. This project has a straightforward pitch due to its high scalability and low-cost smart contract platform. In addition, it provides a high level of scalability in an ecosystem without solutions such as sharding. Cheung believes that these features allow the application build on Solana to have &apos;synchronous composability&apos;. This matters because with a single shared state and synchronous composability every application on Solana can communicate with each other atomically. As Ethereum moves forwards with its migration from a Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm to Proof-of-Stake, its DeFi ecosystem could lose this property. Thus, some applications could become less interoperable with each other or stop working altogether.

The cryptocurrency was trading at around $46,000 at press time and is roughly flat over the past 24 hours.      On Monday, the total crypto market cap surpassed $2 trillion for the first time since mid-May, according to CoinMarketCap data. Ether and cardano are standouts in the recent crypto rally, with strong rallies month to date, rising 26% and 62% respectively, compared with a 16% rise in bitcoin during the same period. XRP is also up 70% so far this month.      The rapid rise in crypto prices has some analysts expecting a pause. Katie Stockton, managing director of Fairlead Strategies, highlighted signs of upside exhaustion in bitcoin in her Monday newsletter.      Upside exhaustion signals could “support a brief period of consolidation as gains are digested and short-term overbought conditions are relieved,” Stockton wrote.      “Even though the trend has flipped bullish, a pullback is to be expected before continuation.

Bitcoin mining reserves rise    Bitcoin miners have added more of the cryptocurrency to their reserves in the past few weeks.      “The reserves are now close to this year’s all-time high of May 9, recovering the outflows in June,” Jan Wuestenfeld, an analyst at blockchain analysis firm CryptoQuant, wrote in a blog post.      Miners ""appear to be unimpressed by the most recent price moves (likely expecting higher prices),” Wuestenfeld wrote. “The fact that miners are not under pressure to sell their BTC at these prices is a testament to the health and resilience of the miners and the network.”    Ether options    Total ether options open interest exceeded $4 billion last week, which reached a two-month high, according to Skew, a provider of data on cryptocurrency derivatives markets. The options market is bullish on ether after a decisive break above $3,000 last week.      Skew data also shows a decline in ETH options volume over the past few weeks, which coincided with short-term overbought signals. Option traders have assigned a 64% probability of ether remaining above $3,000 this month, which is near technical support.    Digital-asset fund outflows    Investors redeemed a net $22.1 million from cryptocurrency funds last week, the sixth consecutive week of outflows, even as bitcoin and many other digital assets rallied, a new report shows.      It’s the longest streak of outflows since January 2018, according to the report Monday by the digital-asset manager CoinShares.      Investors have seen an outflow of $22 million from bitcoin, even though the largest cryptocurrency has recently traded up to $48,200 from a low of $29,608 last month.    Coinbase exchange volume    Last week, the volume of Internet Computer (ICP) on Coinbase went up significantly as the price rallied 50%, according to a report by the crypto exchange. Dogecoin's (DOGE) volume on Coinbase also climbed higher as the price rose as retail investors became engaged again. Volume of FARM, the token of the automatic yield farming protocol Harvest Finance, rose 70%.      Meanwhile, volume in ETH on Coinbase continues to surpass BTC, with Aug. 7 being the most extreme, as the ratio of ETH and BTC volumes was 67:33.    Altcoin roundup  Solana, Terra hit all-time highs: Prices for Solana’s SOL and Terra’s LUNA tokens hit all-time highs on Monday, as the total market capitalization of cryptocurrency broke $2 trillion for the first time since May, CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen reports. The price rally for the tokens representing two projects that are built for the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, shows that investors remain confident about the industry, especially in layer 1 protocols, despite security risks exposed by the biggest DeFi hack ever in monetary value last week.  Figment raises $50M to build up proof-of-stake infrastructure: Blockchain infrastructure provider Figment raised $50 million in a Series B funding round that was led by institutional investors Senator Investment Group and Liberty City Ventures. Anchorage Digital, Galaxy Digital and 10T Ventures also participated in the funding, Figment said Monday. The company plans to use the funding to expand its infrastructure across the proof-of-stake (PoS) industry supporting the services it provides ""up and down the Web 3 stack.""  Huobi revenue took a hit in July, token burn suggests: The amount of Huobi token that Huobi Global burned in July indicates the crypto exchange’s revenue probably fell last month. The total value of HT burned dropped 54% from June to $22.3 million, the exchange said. The burn is correlated to revenue, and so a decrease in burned tokens indicates a fall in revenue. Token burning is a process by which crypto coins are taken out of circulation, often aimed at reducing the total supply of the tokens and thus theoretically increasing their value.  Watford F.C. Sports Dogecoin Logo: Watford F.C. players sported the dogecoin logo on their shirt sleeves as the soccer team returned to England’s top-tier Premier League on Saturday. The Shibu Inu meme-inspired crypto's logo appeared on Watford's shirts as part of the club's sponsorship deal with crypto-betting platform Stake.com.

42424755,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWOVh,1629142265,Poly Network Hack Not Over as Attacker Prolongs Return of Funds,"The Poly Network cyberattack saga has dragged into its second week with the hacker or hackers yet to provide the key for the multi-signature wallet needed to complete the full return of the roughly $600 million that was stolen, with the exception of the $33 million worth of the stablecoin USDT that was frozen by Tether.    China-based Poly Network had previously offered $500,000 to the attacker or attackers as a reward for returning the money taken on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Ethereum and Polygon platforms in what is likely the largest-ever hack of a decentralized finance (DeFi) site.  The hack or hackers acknowledged receiving the offer and initially said they had declined it, but had instead begun (and eventually completed) returning the stolen funds to a multi-signature wallet set up by Poly Network. The hacker or hackers haven’t turned over the final key for the wallet, though.  In a message posted to the Ethereum blockchain at 1:45 p.m. UTC on Monday, the attacker, who the Poly Network is calling “Mr. White Hat” but who some others doubt is a true white hat hacker, said that they were considering taking the bounty and using it to reward anyone else who can hack the cross-chain platform. A “white hat” attacker is one who tries to exploit vulnerabilities in a protocol to help expose and ultimately fix bugs or loopholes in the underlying code.  ”MONEY MEANS LITTLE TO ME, SOME PEOPLE ARE PAID TO HACK, I WOULD RATHER PAY FOR THE FUN,” the attacker or attackers wrote. “IF THE POLY DON’T GIVE THE IMAGINARY BOUNTY, AS EVERYBODY EXPECTS, I HAVE WELL ENOUGH BUDGET TO LET THE SHOW GO ON.”  ”I TRUST SOME OF THEIR CODE, I WOULD PRAISE THE OVERALL DESIGN OF THE PROJECT, BUT I NEVER TRUST THE WHOLE POLY TEAM,” the attacker added.  ”I WILL PROVIDE THE FINAL KEY WHEN _EVERYONE_ IS READY. MY IDEA IS NOT CHANGED, BUT I DO WORRY IT MIGHT BE AN ENDLESS WAR. SO I MIGHT RELEASE IT EARLIER AS LONG IF THE COMMUNITY UNDERSTANDS EVERYTHING.”  In an email to the media on Tuesday at 10:25 a.m. UCT, Poly Network said that it has completed the second phase of its “Mainnet Upgrade” in response to the attack, and has maintained daily contact with the attacker to update him or her on their progress. “We have made constant efforts to establish an understanding with Mr. White Hat and genuinely hope that Mr. White Hat will transfer the private keys as soon as possible so that we can return full asset control back to the users at the earliest.”  Poly Network also said it is counting on “experts” like the attacker to help improve the security of its network, and with that in mind, was inviting him or her to become Poly Network’s Chief Security Advisor.  Poly Network reiterated that it has no intention of holding the attacker legally responsible, and that its offer to reward Mr. White Hat with a $500,000 bug bounty still stood, despite the attacker considering using the funds to reward others who are able to hack the Poly Network. “We fully respect Mr. White Hat's thoughts, and to express our gratitude, we will still transfer this $500,000 bounty to a wallet address approved by Mr. White Hat for him to use it at his own discretion for the cause of cybersecurity and supporting more projects and individuals,” the Poly Network said. “Whatever Mr. White Hat chooses to do with the bounty in the end, we have no objections.  Poly Network also joined Immunefi in offering a separate bug bounty of $100,000 for finding critical vulnerabilities in its network, with a total bounty pool of $500,000 for security researchers and white hats who submit valid bugs.

42424757,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWOZh,1629141064,6 Reasons DeFi Will Stay Inefficient (and Profitable),"During the last two years, decentralized finance (DeFi) has become one of the most attractive venues for crypto investors and traders. Disproportionally high yields, asymmetrical arbitrage opportunities and what feels like a never-ending wave of new protocols have created a regular stream of lucrative opportunities in the DeFi space. We discussed some of the alpha opportunities in DeFi in a previous CoinDesk article.      The asymmetry of these opportunities is directly related to the inefficiencies of a nascent market like DeFi. The dominant narrative among DeFi supporters is that the alpha opportunities in DeFi are likely to dissipate as the market becomes more efficient. That thesis seems aligned with the behavior of most financial markets in history but how would it play out in DeFi? Can DeFi become an efficient market?    Jesus Rodriguez is the CEO of IntoTheBlock, a market intelligence platform for crypto assets. He has held leadership roles at major technology companies and hedge funds. He is an active investor, speaker, author and guest lecturer at Columbia University in New York.    A good recipe to try to answer these questions is to understand the fundamentals of capital markets efficiency and map those fundamentals to the world of DeFi. Theories about market efficiencies have a rich history involving some very colorful characters.    The efficient market hypothesis    The idea of quantifying the dynamics of efficiency in financial markets has been around for centuries. In 1863, French stockbroker Jules Regnault observed that price deviations in a security are directly proportional to the square root of time. In other words, the longer you hold a security, the more you are exposed to wins or losses due to price variations.      One relatively unknown hero in the evolution of ideas about market efficiency was the French mathematician Louis Bachelier, who is famous for being one of the fathers of modern statistics. In some of his works, Bachelier deduced that “the mathematical expectation of speculators in financial markets is near zero.” Many of these ideas were way ahead of their time and were rediscovered almost a century after in the context of efficient market theories.      Some of the ideas about efficiency in capital markets caught momentum in the 1950s with the work of economists Milton Friedman and Paul Samuelson. Samuelson, in particular, was a big promoter of Bachelier’s work and its applicability to equities markets. Genius mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot also dabbled in market efficiency models and challenged some of the common beliefs around stock prices distributions.      The work in the early second half of the 20th century takes us to the most important paper in the efficiency of financial markets. In 1970, Eugene F. Fama published “Efficient Capital Markets: A Review of Theory and Empirical Work,” in which he defines an efficient market as “a market in which prices always ‘fully reflect’ available information…” This was the essence of what we know as the efficient market hypothesis (EMH).    Read more: Finding Alpha in DeFi | Jesus Rodriguez    In the paper, Fama presented three types of efficient markets: (i) strong-form; (ii) semi-strong form; and (iii) weak based on the way public and non-public information is factored in the price of the asset. The other important contribution of Fama’s paper was the famous “joint hypothesis problem” that essentially says the EMH cannot be quite tested or rejected. To explain this, let’s assume for a short minute that crypto was an efficient market subject to the principles of the EMH. Let’s say that we have an asset pricing model that indicates that the price of ethereum should be $4,000 in a month. Then ethereum’s price skyrockets to $5,000, which is a high deviation from the asset pricing model. The joint hypothesis problem indicates that we can never be sure if the market was inefficient or the asset pricing model was wrong. In other words, we can’t quite prove if abnormal prices are a result of market inefficiencies or that the flaws in the model used to price the assets in the first place.      The EMH has divided economists and market experts for decades. Certainly, new markets are more prompt to show signs of inefficiencies and, therefore, challenge some of the principles of EMH. This is certainly the case of DeFi.    Six sources of market inefficiency in DeFi    Massive Information Asymmetry: Nothing causes more inefficiencies in a financial market like the asymmetry of information between insiders and general investors. In the case of DeFi, people who are close to the protocol projects have disproportionately richer access to information than the investors using the protocols. Earlier access to information such as new liquidity pools, governance changes or protocol modifications can result in significant edges in the DeFi market.      Let’s take the example of an automated market maker (AMM) protocol that is about to launch some new pools to boost liquidity for a specific token. Having access to information about that could allow insiders to be ready to supply liquidity right when the pool launches, thus capturing a significant portion of the rewards.    Read more: DeFi Is the Next Frontier of High-Frequency Trading | Jesus Rodriguez    A growing protocol ecosystem: Traditional capital markets operate over an infrastructure that has been established for decades while DeFi is building on top of a constantly changing landscape. New financial primitives in the form of DeFi protocols are being launched every week. During the growth phase, those protocols are going to be natively inefficient and effects of those inefficiencies will cascade through other areas of the DeFi space. For instance, a new algorithmic stablecoin can regularly deviate from its pegged value creating arbitrage opportunities.      Governance changes: Governance proposals regularly change the behavior of DeFi protocols, leading to market inefficiencies. This dynamic is very unique to DeFi and has no clear equivalent in traditional capital markets. From changes in incentive mechanisms to more drastic modifications to the behavior of a specific protocol, DeFi governance is a regular source of inefficiencies in the market. A clear example of this could be a governance proposal that changes the length and weights of different liquidity pools in an AMM which leads to higher yields produced by the pools with better incentives.      Protocol attacks: By now, hackers and security attacks can be considered a native element of the DeFi ecosystem. New protocols are regularly exploited creating liquidity gaps in the market which can be leveraged in different trades. From that perspective, security attacks are, in effect, a source of inefficiency in DeFi which has no parallel in other financial markets.      The CeFi influence: The dichotomy between CeFi (centralized finance) and DeFi is one of the most unique dynamics in crypto and one that can be considered a source of market inefficiencies. Events that take place on centralized exchanges have ripple effects in the DeFi market and vice versa, creating regular opportunities for arbitrage. A classic example could be an increase in trading activity in a given DeFi governance token in centralized venues, which can lead to a price increase and translate into improved rewards in the corresponding DeFi protocol.    Read more: When DeFi Becomes Intelligent | Jesus Rodriguez    A fragmented ecosystem: The fragmentation of DeFi, with a large number of different protocols, is hard to mitigate. A large number of crypto assets traded in highly diverse protocols that are not integrated will produce price mismatches and regular arbitrage opportunities between those protocols. As DeFi continues to grow, this level of fragmentation is likely to increase, leading to higher market inefficiencies before it consolidates, producing the opposite effect.    An efficiently inefficient market    Traditional market wisdom tells us the future of DeFi is to become a relatively efficient market. We should expect a consolidation in protocols and blockchains, a contraction in the yields and liquidity mining programs and a more transparent flow of information across the ecosystem. However, some of the factors discussed in the previous section make that path to an efficient market far from trivial. DeFi is still a very nascent market that hasn’t seen a major adoption from mainstream investors.      Those variables indicate the inefficiencies in DeFi are likely to continue for the foreseeable future. And some sources of inefficiency in DeFi are native characteristics of the ecosystem and not a byproduct of market dynamics. Transitioning to efficient market dynamics is going to take a bit more than the natural growth of the DeFi ecosystem. Maybe we can all agree that DeFi will become an efficiently inefficient market.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,Jesus Rodriguez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/16/6-reasons-defi-will-stay-inefficient-and-profitable,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c5aedf1700050a95395483e6f5f954acb17a987d-1400x1050.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Bitcoin moving average is a method used to smooth out the price data by taking the average price over a specific period of time. For the 21-week MA, data from the past 21 weeks is used, while for the 200-day MA, prices from the last 200 days are used. This method &apos;smooths out&apos; the price curve in the sense that it eliminates the many small up-down fluctuations of the price that aren&apos;t relevant to long-term analysis.

Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) and Glenn Thompson (R-Pa.) said Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler’s recent comments on increasing crypto regulation, and a letter Gensler sent Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) that the SEC needs more authority to regulate cryptocurrency, provide a “concerning roadmap for regulatory actions that will have long-term implications.”    In an open letter to Gensler and acting Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Rostin Behnam, the congressmen said that “rather than regulate innovation and job creation out of this country, we should promote an active dialogue between regulators and market participants.” The two noted that this is the goal of H.R. 1602, the Eliminate Barriers to Innovation Act of 2021, which passed the U.S. House of Representatives in April.  The 2021 act requires the SEC and the CFTC to establish a joint Working Group on Digital Assets with market participants, organizations involved in academic research and investor protection organizations, among others.  The two said that lawmakers and regulators should work together to balance protecting innovation with any new regulations to “ensure the digital asset marketplace flourishes in the United States.”  They called on Gensler, Behnam and their fellow commissioners to provide details on how the SEC and CFTC plan to work together on these issues.

Stanford was instrumental in the rise of Silicon Valley, and the MIT has helped birth thousands of tech startups, from artificial intelligence to aerospace.      What role will universities play in the development of blockchain technology? Will they be as pivotal as before, or will the cryptocurrency industry, by nature distrustful of institutions and central authorities, develop its own academic methods and learning approaches?      CoinDesk is keen to track how universities are doing when it comes to blockchain education across courses, employment outcomes, student services and research. In October 2020, we published our first ranking of the top 20 U.S. schools for getting an education in blockchain (MIT, Cornell University and the University of California, Berkeley were the top three).    Read more: The Top Universities for Blockchain (2020 Ranking)    This year, we're going further, analyzing 200 schools in the U.S. and internationally and adding ranking categories.      To identify the best schools, we need your help. We're asking students, practicing academics and industry stakeholders to give their opinions in the survey below.      Don't worry, it doesn't take long. You can choose between a quick one-minute questionnaire and a deeper five-minute one. And you’ll be doing a valuable service: Our goal in tracking and comparing what universities are doing on blockchain education and research is to improve overall standards – and, in turn, the entire industry.      We’ve seen plenty of blockchain startups emerge from universities already, including Ava Labs from Cornell and Algorand from MIT. Most leading schools now offer classes in blockchain subjects. Some have built research centers, hired specialist faculty and sanctioned student clubs.      The big question is whether universities can remain relevant to such a fast-moving industry.

42424749,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWOHh,1629139114,The Race for Stablecoin Transparency,"The stablecoin industry is plunging into a transparency war of sorts, with stablecoin issuers tripping over each other to provide the public with ever more financial information.      Earlier this month, the company behind the world’s biggest stablecoin by market cap, tether, began to publish verified numbers on the makeup of its reserves. Tether was reacting to last month's move by Circle, the issuer of second-biggest stablecoin USDC, to disclose its own information about the composition of USDC's investments. CoinDesk's Frances Yue provides a useful summary of the recent ramp-up in the transparency war.    J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog.    Any extra disclosure is good for stablecoin consumers. But for stablecoin issuers, the transparency wars make an already-difficult business model even more complicated to execute.    A race to the top    When it comes to transparency, an industry standard has evolved whereby the issuer publishes regular attestation reports. In these attestation reports, the stablecoin issuer attests to its auditor how many reserves it has, and the auditor examines this claim for validity. The auditor's findings then get posted for the public to see.      Up till now, attestation reports did not disclose much about the sorts of investments held to “back” stablecoins. And so the composition of stablecoin reserves has always been mostly a matter of conjecture and rumour. With Tether and Circle now providing attested information about the composition of their assets, and not just quantity, consumers finally know what that ""something"" is.      In Tether’s case, its biggest reserve asset is commercial paper, most of it rated A-1 or A-2. And USDC’s preferred backing asset is cash and cash equivalents, with a big allocation to Yankee certificates of deposit.    Read more: What We Know – and Don’t Know – About Stablecoins’ Dollar Backing    I suspect this new transparency will create beneficial knock-on effects for consumers. Equipped with more information, consumers can better shop around for the safest coins. To attract them, stablecoin issuers will have to demonstrate their backing assets are sound. That means the entire sector will be pressured to cleanse itself of dreck collateral.      This process may even satisfy regulatory hawks, who have begun to circle the stablecoin sector with concerns about the possibility of stablecoin runs and contagion effects.      In Tether's case, we've already seen an improvement in asset quality. As one of the many conditions of a February legal settlement with the New York Attorney General, Tether was obliged to provide a quarterly breakdown of its investments to the public.      To comply, Tether produced its now notorious pie chart, an information-lite graphic that raised more questions than it answered. The pie chart showed, for instance, that 24% of Tether's investments (as of March 31) were held in the form of a scary-looking assortment of assets that included secured loans, corporate bonds, funds and precious metals, and other investments.      Tether's newest attestation (dated June 30) reveals this scary grouping had fallen to just 15% of assets. Meanwhile, Tether's allocation to Treasury bills, a safe short-term form of government debt, has risen from 3% to 24%. With greater transparency comes more pressure to invest customers' funds prudently, it would seem.      If tether stablecoins are safer than before, there's plenty of work to do. Tether should be telling users more about its corporate bond portfolio. What is the minimum rating of its bonds? What is their average maturity?      As for Circle, courtesy of its beefed-up attestation reports we now know that 61% of USDC’s investments are placed in cash and cash equivalents. Unfortunately, by consolidating these items together, Circle doesn't provide sufficient granularity. Circle should do what Tether has already done in its reporting: deconsolidate cash, the safest of backing assets, from riskier 90-day commercial paper.    It's gotten tougher to be a stablecoin    Stablecoin customers are better off now than a few months ago. But what about stablecoin issuers?      The transparency wars will only make things more complicated for Circle, Tether and the rest. To begin with, regular attestations aren't free. Auditors need to be paid. And the more complex the auditing requirements, the higher an auditors' fee.      Even worse, a transparency-induced competition to safety means lower revenue for issuers. A big portion of stablecoin revenue accrue from the interest income thrown off by a stablecoin's backing investments, which issuers keep for themselves rather than paying out to their customers. A five-year corporate bond currently yields around 1.2% per year. With increased transparency, juicier assets such as these will be increasingly out of bounds for issuers. But the alternative, safe assets like Treasury bills and bank deposits, don't yield much. These days they offer a miniscule 0.05% or so.      Stablecoin financial health has already been damaged by low interest rates. When COVID-19 hit in March 2020, global interest rates plunged and have stayed low ever since.      Here’s an example of the damage that’s been inflicted. According to Circle's recently published financial statements, there was only $520 million USDC in circulation at year-end 2019. By year-end 2020, this number had hit $4 billion. That’s an impressive growth rate. But the collapse in interest rates nullified all of USDC’s expansion. USDC made more interest income in all of 2019 ($6.2 million) than it did in 2020 ($4.4 million), despite being just 1/10th the size.      If increased transparency crimps stablecoin revenue, a boatload of other costs only adds to the complexities of turning a profit. Stablecoin issuers must fight other crypto firms for talent. Regulation is also expensive. Circle, for instance, has 44 different money transmitter licenses, each of which has its own requirements. The company has expressed an intention to become a full-reserve bank, but that will subject it to more demanding liquidity and capital requirements.      To fight for market share, stablecoin issuers sometimes split interest revenue with large customers. In the quarter ending March 30, 2021, for instance, Circle owed ""USDC rebates"" of $5.7 million to customers with whom it shares revenue. That's a big chunk of Circle's revenue out the window.      This combination of lower interest rates and a raft of expenses is why Circle lost $9 million in the first quarter of 2021 on revenue of $17 million. (We only know the financial health of Circle because it is planning an initial public offering, and must disclose this information.)    When KYC on all their customers?    There is another potentially large expense on the horizon. Right now, stablecoin users limit their customer due diligence to users who want to redeem or deposit for actual U.S. dollars. Anyone in between is allowed to use stablecoins without being identified. I can receive $1 million tether and send them to you, and neither of us need to reveal who we are. This ""in-between"" segment comprises a big percentage of stablecoin users.      However, the U.S. President's Working Group on Financial Markets has said that stablecoin arrangements ""should have the capability to obtain and verify the identity of all transacting parties, including for those using unhosted wallets."" In a recent interpretive letter on stablecoin arrangements, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) echoed the Working Group's conclusions.      If these requirements are eventually imposed on stablecoins, that would mean they would have to collect information about all users, potentially exploding their know-your-customer/anti-money laundering (KYC/AML) budgets.    Read more: Circle Isn’t Winning the Stablecoin Transparency Race | J.P. Koning    Banks can afford all of these costs because they have multiple lines of business including investment banking and insurance. Huge portfolios of long-term assets provide a solid stream of interest payments: mortgages, corporate loans, consumer credit and more. But unless they want to become banks, stablecoins can only rely on low-yield, low-yielding assets for interest income.      As for non-banks like PayPal, they rely less on interest income to generate revenue and more on transaction fees.      If they are to survive, stablecoins probably can’t remain the plain-vanilla stablecoins they've been for the last six-or-so years. They may have to start adding bank-like products or PayPal-style fees.      Circle is already adding bank-like products. It offers customers the chance to lend their USDC stablecoins to Circle and earn interest, which Circle then lends to third parties. However, with crypto lenders BlockFi and DeFi Money Market recently running afoul of securities law for offering similar lending products, the window for extracting revenue from this business line may be narrowing.      That’s not all Circle is doing. In late 2020, it rolled out a transactional services offering that provides APIs for customers who want to use USDC accounts for salary or supplier payouts. Already this business line is beginning to bring in more revenue than the interest income harvested from USDC’s assets.      Amid already low interest rates, transparency wars and ongoing regulatory uncertainty, it remains to be seen whether new product lines are sufficient to ensure that stablecoins remain a viable payments product. One thing that is certain. The more transparency there is, the safer the product is for consumption.",POSITIVE,USDC,BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | USDT | USDC,JP Koning,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/16/the-race-for-stablecoin-transparency,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a45ce68d786aad99138c221173cb85465030d27a-1400x863.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Audius users are now able to simply upload tracks and share them to TikTok, which Audius’s founders say takes less than a minute.

42424748,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWOBh,1629138119,"Privacy Without DeFi Is Boring, DeFi Without Privacy Is Predatory","In the pursuit of excitement and growth, the crypto community has largely relegated privacy to the back burner of blockchain innovation. Such a transition is not only antithetical to the very ethos of decentralization, but myopic and regressive in the extreme.      To succeed in replacing traditional finance, digital assets and the cryptographic protocols that support them must manifest decentralized architecture that both facilitates permissionless exchange and confers unequivocal fungibility to all financial instruments via privacy-centric protocols.    Alex Shipp is the head of business development at Offshift, a privacy-focused derivatives platform.    In reality, the subtle, systemic benefits of privacy – important though they may be – pale in comparison to decentralized finance's (DeFi) provocative double-digit APYs and non-fungible token (NFT) auction markets, which have reeled in the attention and capital of cryptocurrency’s mass market, leading elite developer teams and venture capital resources to follow in suit. Now, DeFi is advancing at the expense of privacy-focused initiatives, which only continue to sink further into the backdrop.      DeFi presents an enticing opportunity to make untold fortunes, while privacy-centric architecture can only offer broad social and economic benefits that take form over time and rarely pay. For now, the problem remains: DeFi and privacy stand diametrically opposed in the modern landscape of cryptographic innovation, as the presence of each demands the exclusion of the other.      Edward Snowden’s words from Ethereal 2021 speak to the imperative of private decentralized finance (PriFi) more eloquently than any others could:    The internet already allows us to do tremendous things, but it’s being controlled – it’s being exploited. And the financial aspect is where a lot of this control is entering through […] we can permit people to act without permission and privately in this space, in which I think […] alt-coins need to be private, or they are failing. This is my position.  DeFi’s next frontier    PriFi platforms establish a tech-o-nomic standard that dissolves the existing trade-offs between DeFi and privacy. The PriFi Standard encompasses all of the following components:    A basis in decentralized, sound money  Truly decentralized financial applications  Uncompromising privacy  On-chain architecture  Close, but no cigar    To this point, there have been many earnest attempts to establish genuine PriFi platforms in the crypto space, but none has yet to hit the mark.    Privacy coins    Monero, Zcash, and others have developed independent blockchains which confer privacy as a solitary value proposition. As per their intention, users remain siloed, unable to interact with the rapidly evolving DeFi landscape and totally isolated from operations involving credit and derivatives. Privacy coins allow individuals to store wealth securely in the event of an economic catastrophe; like bitcoin, they are havens, not solutions.    Off-chain private DeFi    In the effort to bring privacy to DeFi, a number of projects have begun building privacy-centric DeFi platforms on standalone blockchains, a compromise of sorts between the privacy coin model championed by Monero and the DeFi innovation at the forefront of everything crypto. Unfortunately, in the pursuit of private DeFi, off-chain initiatives impose a host of trade-offs and limitations which can only be surmounted by conquering incumbent public blockchain ecosystems and absorbing their communities.      In this regard, building a privacy-centric DeFi application off-chain is like giving out loans denominated in Alex-dollars (believe me, I’ve tried): It aims to fix a credit problem by inventing new money. The path to cultivating a robust user base for one’s credit instruments is a long and arduous journey on its own. Building an independent blockchain, on the other hand, requires the development of a robust, battle-tested consensus mechanism, a globally decentralized ecosystem of validators, and a community of adept developer teams. Secret Network, Incognito and Haven are among the ambitious platforms building their own privacy-centric financial universes from ground zero. More power to them.    On-chain mixers and tumblers    Applications like Miximus and Mobius divide and shuffle public tokens through a network of random addresses in order to dissociate them from their original owners. Though useful tools, these types of applications operate with digital assets that are fully public, and which ultimately land at new public addresses. They are neither a complete nor a sustainable PriFi solution, as they do not provide for truly private ownership.    Layer 2 private DeFi    Aztec Protocol, whose EIP 1724 was one of the first to publicly conceive on-chain privacy, supports certain applications of decentralized finance in the Ethereum ecosystem. However, by virtue of employing a ZK-Rollup, Aztec’s obfuscation process takes place on a layer 2 with a code that is closed source, and by default not trustless (see: Offshift’s proprietary research). If monetary and economic history have revealed a single, incontrovertible lesson, it is that systems that can be exploited will be exploited. Unequivocally, we need a robust, comprehensive and inclusive PriFi solution, one that is fully decentralized, that is uncompromising in protecting user privacy, and that operates fully on-chain - on layer 1 in the Ethereum and Polkadot ecosystems. There are to be no if’s, and’s or bridges.    The way forward    Technically speaking, PriFi composes a suite of emergent, decentralized applications that facilitate advanced, on-chain financial operations while fully protecting user privacy and minimizing tradeoffs with transparent, public incumbents in the DeFi space. PriFi applications release privacy from the burden of mutual exclusivity, so it can become an accessible and affordable feature that does not demand technical savvy.      Pragmatically speaking, modern internet infrastructure is both a gift and curse. While blockchain-based systems have produced tremendous advancements in the realms of property ownership, money and finance, they sit atop highly exploitative systems designed to streamline surveillance, systematic wealth extraction and censorship. PriFi is the one-stop, one-click, opt-out that any freedom-oriented individual can access and use.    Read more: Public Opinion Shifts on Big Tech and Privacy During Pandemic    Really, it’s all or nothing. Without PriFi, the prospects of sound credit – and therefore of a world where individuals are endowed with freedom and communities with stability – there is very little that will be able to curb the encroaching wave of authoritarianism from enacting technocratic systems of mass surveillance that absolve privacy and ordain censorship and centralized control as global norms.      PriFi means returning crypto to its privacy-centric roots without holding back innovation, so developers, engineers and entrepreneurs at the cutting edge can create and build freely without disconnecting from the purpose that seeded their journey in the first place. PriFi means stepping forward boldly into uncharted territory without leaving your principles nor your people behind; it means adventure without recklessness, innovation without sacrifice, freedom without chaos, evolution without regression.      Privacy without DeFi is boring. DeFi without privacy is predatory. PriFi is the way forward.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET,Alex Shipp,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/16/privacy-without-defi-is-boring-defi-without-privacy-is-predatory,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5da2e11a57d5fcb476ec88fb9eea40cba46a0c2d-2048x1138.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42424750,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWO9h,1629137581,"Solana, Terra Hit All-Time Highs as Markets Disregard Last Week’s DeFi Hacks","Prices for Solana’s SOL and Terra’s LUNA tokens hit all-time highs on Monday, as the total market capitalization of cryptocurrency broke $2 trillion for the first time since May.      The price rally for the tokens representing two projects that are built for the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector shows that investors remain confident about the industry, especially in layer 1 protocols, despite security risks that were exposed by the biggest DeFi hack ever in monetary value last week.      Solana, the native token of Solana, a public blockchain that is backed by Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of crypto exchange FTX, logged a record high price Monday of $69, according to data from FTX and TradingView.      Meanwhile, Messari's data shows that Terra ($LUNA), the token of Terra, an algorithmic balancing system that helps stablecoins maintain their pegs to stable currencies like the U.S. dollar, went as high as $22.22 on Monday, also an all-time high.      Both projects are layer 1 alternatives to Ethereum, the blockchain for ether, the second biggest cryptocurrency by market cap.      Solana and Terra's rise, according to analysts, reflects the market’s increasing demand for higher scalability, as the recent non-fungible tokens (NFTs) craze has brought crypto to a more mainstream market and many investors and traders continue to bet that Ethereum’s impending migration from a proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain to a proof-of-stake (PoS) on will be delayed.      At press time, ether was changing hands at $3,226.39, up 2.09%, according to CoinDesk 20, compared with SOL’s gain of 27% on the day.      “The NFT-driven mania presented in the Ethereum space is starting to spill over into its layer 1 competitors,” Adam James, senior analyst at OKEx Insights, said. “Because the alternative layer 1 [protocols] haven't all had pieces of positive development news at the exact same time, it stands to reason that speculation is the primary driver pushing funds into less-fleshed-out blockchain ecosystems.”      In particular, Solana's aggressive push with its latest release of the Wormhole, cross-chain communication protocol between Ethereum and Solana, could not be “timelier,” said Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Synergia Capital.      “The need for [a] scalable network is needed right now, as opposed to years away as is the case for Ethereum given its much needed undergoing transition to PoS,” Vinokourov said.      The launch of Wormhole’s main network has also occurred as new protocols that allow digital tokens to be transferred across multiple blockchains have become particularly vulnerable to attacks: Last week, cross-chain DeFi site Poly Network was attacked with losses worth more than $600 million, the biggest DeFi hack to date.      The hype around Wormhole shows that investors and traders remain confident in cross-chain protocols as they downplay the security risks.      Hacks “are not great, of course, but I think crypto natives have proven to be very resilient,” Vinokourov said.      LUNA’s price rally, meanwhile, can be attributed to its anticipated Columbus-5 network upgrade that is set to go live in the next few weeks, as well as to the fact that users can now use ether as collateral on the Anchor protocol, a lending and saving platform in Terra’s ecosystem.      Columbus-5 upgrade ""will make ... all swap fees go to Luna stakers, instead of being burned like they were in the past,"" Justin Barlow, research analyst at The Tie, said. ""Numerous apps on Terra are also slated to be released after the Columbus-5 launch, so we’ll be see a huge influx of new projects going live on the network.      ""As each project goes live, Terra stakers will receive airdrops of the token in-kind for their staking efforts,"" Barlow added.      On the other hand, Anchor's news pushed up the total value locked in Anchor to nearly $2.2 billion from $1.75 billion in just three days, data from DeFi Llama shows.      LUNA, as CoinDesk reported, is part of an algorithmic balancing system that helps the stablecoins in Terra maintain their pegs. For example, when TerraUSD (UST) trades above $1, users can send $1 worth of LUNA to the system and receive 1 UST in return – a trade that helps to bring the stablecoin’s price back in line.      The growth of total value locked in Anchor reflects demand for UST, because borrowing on Anchor is subsidized by Anchor liquidity mining, said Jeremy Ong, vice president of business opportunities at research firm Delphi Digital. And as demand for UST grows, more LUNA tokens are burned, which naturally drives LUNA’s prices up.      It is also possible that a “Coinbase effect,” where a digital token gets a price pump after listing on the crypto exchange, has hyped up LUNA’s prices as Coinbase listed both wrapped luna (WLUNA), an ERC-20 token that’s designed to track LUNA’s value, and TerraUSD (UST), a decentralized stablecoin powered by LUNA and the Terra ecosystem, in the past week.      According to Ong, the timing of Coinbase’s listing of UST also plays a role in boosting LUNA’s price.      “The Coinbase listing for UST probably gave UST a lot more credibility and demand amidst regulatory FUD about stablecoins,” Ong said. “This is the first time a reputable exchange like Coinbase has listed an algorithmic stablecoin like UST.”",POSITIVE,LUNA | SOL,ETH | EXCHANGE | LUNA | MARKET | SOL,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/16/solana-terra-hit-all-time-highs-as-markets-disregard-last-weeks-defi-hacks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/584cc81b1119d188dbe7950499f1add13831e742-900x600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394454,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvdnnh,1629134977,Bitcoin ATMs and the Road to Adoption,"Last week, I published a report looking at the resurgent growth of the crypto community in Puerto Rico. Bull markets are a breeding ground for tax minimization strategies and crypto’s wildest ambitious to remake the world. And while there is a crush of rich crypto investors, builders and founders to the island known for its lenient tax code, crypto is just another professional, white-collar industry there.  Andrew Barnard, founder and president of Bitstop, one of the largest bitcoin ATM networks, wrote in offering insight into what crypto is like on the ground. Bitstop machines are found in over 1,000 locations across the continental U.S. and Puerto Rico.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The company placed 25 machines on the island this year as a test, Barnard said. “Our machines have done OK so far but we spend more time educating than selling,” he said. People still associate crypto with crime or are otherwise intimidated.  That’s not uncommon in the industry. Brimming with revolutionary potential, crypto’s adoption is also dependent on getting people on board with complicated and obscure technologies (even if packaged in the form of an ATM). Money, after all, has almost always been a monopoly interest of the government. In breaking with that, crypto is breaking with one of the cornerstones of civilization. It takes some explaining and some time getting used to it.  “When we first got into the BTM business, we made the mistake of assuming"" it was just like the ATM business, he said. In some aspects, it's similar, but overall it's not. “It’s the same retail customers where ATMs and BTMs are installed but, in the end, the mindset of the buyers is different, the demographic is way different and it's really hard to pinpoint what locations are going to be good or not. It can take nine+ months for a new location to start to produce, this is way different than an ATM where one knows within two-three months if the location is good.”  Barnard said transaction volumes on his BTM network fluctuates strongly because of the relatively few people using the machines.  “In the ATM business, our customers hold over 700 million debit or pre-paid cards in their wallets so at some point during the week we know 80% of those customers will need access to cash, at least $20 for tips and incidentals. Not the same on the crypto side. Only a small portion of the population knows about crypto and an even smaller percentage buys. Of those that buy, not everyone has cash available on a consistent basis to invest in crypto, so the volume of the BTMs is not consistent from one month to another.” And the business is “extremely capital intensive.”  “Not only are the BTMs twice as expensive as the ATMs, but one also has to invest substantial amounts in 'liquidity' or crypto inventory to sell,"" he added. ""Operating expenses are higher because customer service calls are much more frequent on BTMs than ATMs and compliance is becoming a bigger expense as states start to regulate the business more and more.  “Overall, our machines do well, but I have noticed that the bulk of the volume on each location comes from just a handful of customers. That tells me that we have a few die-hard customers but it's not like the island has embraced crypto in any way.”  He continued, “There are ‘crypto-heads’ around and some of them meet regularly to talk about nonsense, but as far as Puerto Ricans running out to buy bitcoin, that has not happened. This is a heavy cash society, our regular ATMs in the island process about twice as [many] transactions as the ones in the U.S. The crypto machines, on average, do about as well as the ones in the mainland.”  Read more: Crypto ATM Installations Have Increased Over 70% This Year  Barnard said education is key to growth, but the road to adoption is long:  “Crypto lives in the real world and we need to be discussing this topic down at the consumer and user level. That is what is going to make or break this as an acceptable medium of payment and currency. I see some of that in the industry but most still live in the clouds (not the iCloud either).”  “Crypto is the future, I have no doubt about that, but we do have a long way to go before it becomes ubiquitous,” he said.

El Salvador’s legislature voted and passed its Bitcoin Law on June 9 that will see the country formally adopting crypto as legal tender on Sept. 7.  Fitch Ratings warned there are “additional regulatory and operating risks” around El Salvador adopting bitcoin as a legal tender, as bitcoin's practical implementation has yet to be defined by regulators worldwide.  The agency stressed that it does not expect bitcoin to be widely used by insurers to make claims or benefit payments, nor to offer policies denominated in the digital currency.  “The risks of using bitcoin largely relate to its rate of acceptance among policyholders. Insurers will likely convert bitcoin into USD as quickly as possible to limit exchange risks, if policyholders decide to use it to pay premiums,” said Fitch in the press release.  Currently El Salvador's insurance sector is exposed to low credit quality securities, mainly sovereign bonds (B-/Rating Outlook Negative).

42424756,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWOPh,1629124790,World Mobile Wraps $39M Token Sale to Launch Mesh Network in Zanzibar,"World Mobile Token Ltd, which facilitates a mobile network built on the sharing economy, has raised $39 million in under five weeks of a public token offering.      The world mobile token (WMT), a utility token launched on the Cardano blockchain in July, sought to raise $40 million in the first five weeks, adding to $5 million that was raised in a private sale.      World Mobile, the U.K.-headquartered telecommunications group that is building the mobile network, is working to bring internet connectivity to nearly half of the population of the world still not connected to the Internet, starting in Africa.      The company’s blockchain-powered wireless mesh network – a set of devices or nodes that work together to share data and information without a centralized point of failure – aims to provide affordable internet access to communities typically ignored by traditional telecommunication service providers.      Meanwhile, the public sale of WMT is expected to kick-start the network’s sharing economy, and incentivize node operators and other WMT owners to improve services and grow the network.      “The primary role of WMT is to incentivize both token holders that want to support the operation of the network by way of delegating their WMT stake to a node operator (stakers) as well as node operators that operate their own nodes,” the company’s white paper said.    Read more: A16z Leads $111M Token Sale for Helium’s HNT    World Mobile is currently deploying equipment to 25 sites in the Tanzanian archipelago Zanzibar to give an estimated 100,000 people or more affordable access to the internet, according to Micky Watkins, chief executive officer of World Mobile Group,      Communities will be able to access the World Mobile network via “air nodes'' that can be as simple as a solar panel, a pole and a wireless access point, Watkins said. By avoiding high-traffic frequencies, and using other avenues like TV white space (unused TV channels) or free-space optics, where data is transmitted through space via light, rural communities will have access to cheaper data packages, according to the World Mobile team on the ground in Zanzibar.      Any interested local business owner will eventually be able to purchase an air node for around $5,000 from the World Mobile Group to connect their local communities to the internet, Watkins said. They will also be able to earn WMT denominated rewards from transaction fees and as inflation rewards, according to the company white paper. But not in every country.      “In countries where cryptocurrency is legal, node operators will be able to receive and spend WMT; however, in countries where the regulations have not yet been established then node operators will receive their rewards in the local, stable currency,” George Cox, chief marketing officer at World Mobile Token Ltd., said in an email.      Watkins declined to comment on the token sale itself, as the World Mobile Group does not want to take part in the promotion of the token for regulatory reasons. Watkins did say the funds raised via the initial token sale will go into rolling out the infrastructure in Africa, software development and establishing partnerships.    Commercial rollout    In 2019, the organization established a solar-powered wireless air node in an isolated fishing village in the East African nation of Tanzania. According to Watkins, after the connection was established the team could not go back to the village for about nine months due to the coronavirus pandemic.      With undisturbed access to the internet, the village fishermen were able to expand their customer network, said Andrew Soper, chief commercial officer at World Mobile Group. The fishermen were previously forced to dry the fish, unable to access customers to sell fresh, reducing the value of their catch by 90%, Soper explained.      “So with access to the internet, what we found was these villages, these fishermen, they were selling fresh fish and fresh prawns to Zanzibar to hotels and to neighboring towns. And what really blew us away was that they were actually exporting live crab to Europe,” Soper said.      With the success story of the fishing village and other trials involving schools in Zanzibar, combined with the newly obtained commercial license to operate in the country, World Mobile is getting ready for a commercial rollout.      “For the last three years, we've self-funded the rollout of several proof of concepts and feasibility studies. As of yet we haven't gone commercial. We've just in the last two months acquired our full commercial licenses. And we're now doing the first rollout,” Watkins said.      According to Soper, Tanzanian users connecting to the internet via World Mobile will also be able to enjoy more affordable data packages, with the new connections offering at least double the current amount of data per unit price locally. Users can pay for internet services with their local currency, Watkins said.      “And we expect to have at least 100,000 users before the end of this year is out [or] at the beginning of next year, in Tanzania itself,” Watkins said.    Read more: Former Apple CEO Gil Amelio Joins Cirus Blockchain Project as Adviser    Only people located in participating countries could purchase WMT during the public sale, Cox said. Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Brazil, Chile, countries within the EU, India, Norway, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland, Turkey, UAE, U.K. and Vietnam were the participating countries. Tanzania, where the initial rollout is taking place, was not on the list of countries because regulations do not allow residents to participate in token-generation events, Cox explained.      “Those who can’t purchase WMT can still earn WMT by creating a vault and sharing their referral link. (They’ll earn 2.5% on each purchase made using their link by someone in a participating country.),” Cox said.      During the public sale, WMT could only be purchased via the cryptocurrencies ADA, BNB (BEP2), BTC, DAI (ERC20), or ETH and not fiat currencies.      “This is due to the regulatory requirements of token sales. Once the token sale is complete, then local business owners and users will be able to top up their wallet using local currency in the same way that they currently top up their mobile services,” Cox said.",POSITIVE,ADA,ADA | ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TOKEN SALE,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/16/world-mobile-wraps-39m-token-sale-to-launch-mesh-network-in-zanzibar,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f85e8d52e33cab7a648c91ee567ad6088e6b5b67-1500x1061.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The tool helps cybercriminals avoid running the risk of being identified when they attempt to cash out their illicit proceeds, according to a blog post from blockchain analytics firm Elliptic.  Only eight hours after Elliptic's blog was published on Friday, Antinalysis' data sources were seized, according to a message from one of its administrators to a BBC cyber reporter.  ""Pharoh,"" the technical administrator for Antinalysis' creator Incognito, claimed that the tool was not meant just for criminals.  Regulated crypto exchanges use analytics tools provided by firms like Elliptic to check customers' deposits' links to illegal activity by analyzing whether they emanate from a wallet with such links.  Antinalysis aims to circumvent that by giving users a preview of the risk identified with crypto and therefore the chances of it leading to their exposure should they deposit it on an exchange.  ""The tool represents a significant new capability for crypto launderers,"" Elliptic co-founder Tom Robinson wrote. ""They can now test their own laundering methods, be it the use of mixers or layering techniques, by screening their own bitcoin wallet, before taking the risk of making a deposit at an exchange or other service provider.""  Robinson also pointed out that Antinalysis makes blockchain analytics available to the public for the first time, enabling crypto users who are concerned about receiving the proceeds of crime to pre-screen addresses before accepting bitcoin. ""To date, this type of analysis has been used primarily by regulated financial service providers,"" he added.

42424729,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWKRh,1629109182,"Huobi Revenue Took a Hit in July, Token Burn Suggests","The amount of Huobi token that Huobi Global burned in July indicates the crypto exchange's revenue probably fell last month.    The total value of HT burned dropped 54% from June to $22.3 million, the exchange said.  The burn is positively correlated to revenue, so a decrease in burned tokens indicates a fall in revenue. Token burning is a process by which crypto coins are taken out of circulation, often aimed at keeping inflation low.  Huobi burns 15% of its revenue, and allocates another 5% of total income to repurchase and burn a portion of HT Team Incentive Rewards, a spokesperson told CoinDesk via WeChat.  The decline is a ""natural response"" to market trends, the Huobi spokesperson said. Trading volumes have decreased throughout the industry in the last month because of regulatory actions, the person said.  Factors other than revenue, such as token price, could also affect the burn, Wayne Zhao, a partner at Beijing-based crypto analytics firm TokenInsight, told CoinDesk.  Huobi's token burn had been increasing since March until it reached $138.579 million in May, and then started dropping. Chinese authorities started a harsh crackdown on the domestic crypto industry in May.  The exchange dissolved a Beijing entity in late July, claiming it was a defunct corporate entity that was not in use.  TokenInsight estimated Huobi's spot trading volume at $1.16 trillion in the second quarter, beaten only by Binance's $3.57 trillion. OKEx was third with $877 billion.

Primarily, the team faced multiple queries, the most prominent among these were as follows. Why does Jax.Network use Bounce instead of PancakeSwap or Uniswap? Perhaps, the most important reason to choose Bounce was its support for fixed-price swaps. Jax.Network has always supported USD prices since its early tokenomics days, and Bounce seemed the perfect choice due to the fixed-price token sale feature. The tokenomics pricing is fixed, but the sale page displays varying values? Since ETH gas prices are rising, there was a subsequent rise in USDT swap charges on Bounce as well. Therefore, ETH swaps were the logical choice in such a scenario. Token pricing underwent further volatile price action due to the rise in ETH prices in the recent past.
