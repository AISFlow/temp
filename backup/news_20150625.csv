42398454,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTWJY,1435269763,Bitcoin Poker Site Operator to Plead Guilty on Gaming Charge,"Bryan Micon, operator of now-defunct bitcoin poker site Seals with Clubs, has agreed to plead guilty to a charge of operating an unlicensed gaming website in Nevada.  Micon traveled from his home in Antigua to Nevada earlier this week to face the gaming charge after a warrant was issued for his arrest in April by the Nevada Attorney General’s Office.  Defense attorney Richard Schonfeld told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that Micon will serve an as-yet-unspecified probation term and pay a fine of $25,000. He will also forfeit assets seized when Nevada Gaming Commission agents raided his home in February, property that includes $900 in cash, computer equipment and just over 3 BTC.  The felony charge would be reduced to a gross misdemeanor, according to the Review-Journal.  The agreement to plead guilty comes months after Seals with Clubs abruptly closed in February, an act closely followed by the raid by the Nevada Gaming Commission.

42398453,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTWIZ,1435267247,Goldman Sachs Survey: Most Millennials Won't Use Bitcoin,"A new survey published by Goldman Sachs has found that just over half of US millennials believe they will never use bitcoin.  Fifty-one percent of the 752 survey respondents said that they had never used bitcoin nor do they have any plans to do so. Twenty-two percent said they currently use it or have used it in the past, and intend to use it again.  An additional 22% said that they have never used bitcoin before but plan on using the digital currency. Just 5% of respondents said they have used bitcoin but do not intend to use it again.  The data forms part of a broader look at the financial inclinations of millennials, including how the demographic chooses financial services and how they manage money.  Among a group of payment options that included credit cards, Apple Pay and Square, bitcoin wallets scored relatively low in terms of trust. Less than 5% of respondents indicated they trust using wallet services, with Coinbase and BitPay being named directly in the survey data.  Few privacy concerns  Notably, a significant number of respondents displayed a general apathy toward financial privacy.  Goldman asked how willing millennials would be to ""accept inconveniences"" in exchange for reduced privacy and better security.  Thirty-four percent of male respondents and 48% of female respondents said that they were “not too bothered” as long as their service isn’t directly affected.  Twenty-two percent said that they are in favor of sacrificing privacy for the sake of security, whereas 20% of survey-takers replied that they weren’t willing to give up financial privacy.  Thirteen percent said that they are happy to accept loss of privacy for higher security, while 11% indicated that they didn’t care because they presume the government is already monitoring their transactions.  Respondents also expressed a high aversion to fees, with many suggesting that the costs would be a major influence in their choice of financial provider.

42398460,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTWOT,1435266099,Chain CEO: Nasdaq Partnership is No PR Stunt,"""This isn't about PR for Nasdaq.""  So explains Adam Ludwin, founder and CEO of Chain, the blockchain technology startup that has been in dialogue with American stock exchange and trading technology specialist Nasdaq for the past year.  Yesterday's announcement that Nasdaq would be testing the blockchain for its pre-IPO exchange Nasdaq Private Market with Chain, Ludwin said, was simply the first joint announcement between two companies that have developed a close working relationship.  But, while other tech companies like Microsoft and Dell have made big entrances into the industry only to fade from the spotlight, Ludwin suggests that Nasdaq's interest is more assured, given that the exchange operator believes the technology can solve key business challenges.  Ludwin told CoinDesk:  ""While the technology to exchange messages for trade is fast, the technology to actually move the asset and settle them is slow and very expensive. The opportunity here is to bring asset transfer into the 21st century and that's something we couldn't do easily before the blockchain.""  Ludwin went on to suggest that Nasdaq Private Market, which enables private companies to track equity ownership and investor relationships, was the right first step for the company due to the limited number of third parties involved in its operation.  ""They can demonstrate that it works and enlist private companies that want to experiment with this type of technology,"" he continued. ""So that's the tactical decision.""  The formal announcement follows a period of growing interest from mainstream financial institutions, including Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange, in blockchain technology, a sentiment evidenced by statements from Nasdaq CEO Greifeld.  “As blockchain technology continues to redefine not only how the exchange sector operates, but the global financial economy as a whole, Nasdaq aims to be at the center of this watershed development,"" he said.  Nasdaq had previously announced in May that it would trial blockchain technology in its equity marketplace, and that it would license its trading technology to exchange startup Noble Markets.  Improving private markets  Ludwin predicted that the pilot will be operational by the end of 2015, with Chain shares trading on the platform alongside an inaugural batch of other private companies.  The shares, he said, will move on the Open Assets protocol, a colored coins implementation that allows users to augment small amounts of bitcoin to represent shares. These shares can then be transfered and tracked across the bitcoin blockchain.  As a result, he suggested that the platform could remove traditional paper management systems and provide a better service than software management systems by eliminating ""human errors"" that could take place in such systems.  Ludwin said that Nasdaq would likely augment the Open Assets implementation to suit the company's needs.  ""There are ways of implementing asset issuance and transfer that are more private than Open Assets,"" he said. ""It will be more private than what people think of as a colored coin today.""  Agnostic approach  Still, while Nasdaq has decided to build on top of the bitcoin blockchain, Ludwin suggested that Chain, and by extension, Nasdaq, are taking an agnostic approach to the technology.  ""We believe that there will be an Internet of chains, there will be many, many interoperable blockchains,"" he continued. ""As that innovation moves forward, one of the things that Nasdaq and First Data have selected us to do is make that transition very simple, starting with Open Assets but over time [maybe] moving that to a sidechain without interrupting the service.""  Ludwin said that Chain is currently exploring all blockchain technologies and decentralized ledgers, but that it made the decision to build on top of bitcoin as he believes it was the ""best tool for the job today"".  The statement is notable given the increasing interest of Wall Street in more experimental permissioned ledgers, alternatives to the bitcoin blockchain that aim for greater levels of efficiency or attempt to create blockchains without tokens. This interest is perhaps best evidenced by Digital Asset Holdings' acquisition of decentralized ledger startup Hyperledger and its plans to release a range of blockchain-based financial products.  Ludwin went on to suggest that enterprise financial institutions are perhaps wary of the public nature of transactions on the bitcoin blockchain. Even though such transactions are pseudonymous, tracing the transactions of entities on the blockchain is possible, as new data tools have helped show.  In particular, he cited the privacy feature introduced by Blockstream in its latest Sidechains Elements release.  ""We're very bullish on the pace of innovation happening at the protocol level and the privacy and security features that are continuing to be explored,"" he said.  Still, he suggested that both solutions will likely play a role in a blockchain-enabled future, speaking out about the ""media circus"" that pits these ideas as one-size-fits-all approaches.  ""I think to build an interoperable Internet-based financial network, it's only going to happen if the industry and the open-source community collaborate, and I don't think that can happen if you're building a proprietary protocol,"" he said, adding:  ""[But] I think for that those who have a serious interest and need, like Nasdaq and First Data, there's never just one answer.""

42398447,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTWDe,1435248065,"BitFury Taps Ex-CFTC Chair, Bitcoin Core Developer as Advisors","BitFury has announced a pair of high-profile appointees to its advisory board and established a new body of technical advisors.  New to BitFury's advisory board are former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Dr James Newsome, and president of the Institute for Liberty and Democracy (ILD) Hernando de Soto.  Dr Newsome is also the former CEO of the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). An appointee of President Bill Clinton, he assisted the administration as a member of the President's Working Group for Financial Markets and led the CFTC’s regulatory implementation of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 (CFMA).  Dr Newsome currently serves as a founding partner of Delta Strategy Group, a full-service government affairs firm based in Washington, DC. De Soto heads the ILD, named by The Economist as one of the world's two most important think tanks.  Dr Newsome said he was honored to serve on the board, stating:  ""The forward-thinking approach by BitFury founders and management team regarding education, regulation and support for the entire blockchain community are perfectly aligned with my views.""  De Soto compared BitFury's work to mankind's efforts to manage and utilize its information over the centuries, saying blockchain technology ""may just be one of the most significant contributions to the history of organizing knowledge"".  The bitcoin mining firm has also opened a new office in Washington, DC, a move it suggests will put it closer to some of the US's biggest lobbyists and policy influencers.  Technical advisory board  Separate to its main board, BitFury has also established a technical advisory board that includes bitcoin luminaries Jeff Garzik, original bitcoin core developer and CEO of Dunvegan Space Systems, and Paul Brody, former IBM vice president and Internet of Things (IoT) expert.  Brody is currently the Americas Strategy Leader for the Technology Sector at Ernst & Young.  Echoing his past statements about blockchain technology, he said it has more uses than in just the financial industry:  ""It's about securing a world of billions of smart devices. BitFury has a unique understanding of the scale and scope of the opportunity combined with their deep expertise in hardware and software.""

42398463,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTWPS,1435236582,"Coinplug Wins $45,000 Prize for Blockchain ID Service","Bitcoin services company Coinplug has snatched the top prize in a financial technology competition sponsored by major banking group JB Financial Group.  Over 100 companies vied for a total prize pool of 130m Korean won ($116,200) at the FinTech Frontiers Fair held in Seoul, South Korea.  JB Financial Group  is a financial services company with over 35.5 trillion Korean won ($32.3bn) in assets and 3,300 employees. It is one of the leading innovators of financial technology in East Asia.  Coinplug  's winning entry, which scored 50m KRW ($45,500), was a system utilizing the bitcoin blockchain to verify user identity in online transactions. It works by taking a cryptographic hash of a user's personal information and using that hash to create a certificate, which is then recorded on the blockchain as a transaction.  The blockchain's permanence means that information cannot be altered or modified once saved. Personal information is further protected from leaks, since Coinplug uses only the hashed information to verify, never seeing the original. No personal information needs to be stored at all.  Benefits over existing systems  Coinplug CEO Ryan Uhr told CoinDesk the system offered three main benefits: accessibility on more web browsers, security of private information, and reduced cost of issuance.  The blockchain system can be used in any web browser and does not require additional software such as ActiveX or NPAPI, which need plugins for proper operation. The certificates can also be re-issued easily on Coinplug's smartphone application.  Coinplug  is already in talks with several financial organizations who are interested in offering the service, and Uhr said winning first prize at a mainstream even definitely made other companies pay attention.  ""When blockchain-based authentication systems become a widely used method for financial transactions and e-commerce payments, there will be a very interesting and noticeable change in the market for user certification.""  Cost advantage  South Korea's e-commerce and banking systems are currently required to authenticate users with Microsoft's ActiveX technology, running only on Windows and in the Internet Explorer browser (see details below).  Coinplug's system would also deliver significant cost savings, Uhr added.  The current market size of Korea's user certificate system is around 120bn KRW ($110m), with each new certificate issuance for an individual running at 4,400 KRW ($4) and 110,000 KRW ($110) for a corporation. Registering instead through the blockchain would cost just the 0.0001 BTC (30 KRW, or 3 cents) transaction fee.  Coinplug now needs to wait for official government approval to work its system into the national financial infrastructure.  Particularly important for Korea  Coinplug's use of blockchain technology could free Koreans from a legacy 1990s e-commerce law unique to that country, one that has prompted several security concerns.  In that decade, South Korea developed a local encryption system called SEED, designed to encourage e-commerce by providing user authentication with digital certificates. The only problem was that all e-commerce sites needed to verify the certificates with Microsoft's ActiveX plug-in.  Since ActiveX is supported only on Windows, Korean users were locked into using that system and the Internet Explorer browser. ActiveX is known to have several security flaws, increasing risk of hacking attacks and personal information leaks, with even Microsoft now discouraging its use.  This system is only now beginning to disappear from Korean networks. A law in 2010 mandates that companies who wish to authenticate users with non-ActiveX technology must prove to the government their system offers the same level of insurance.

42398466,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTWSP,1435220110,FTC Warns Consumers of Bitcoin Shopping Risks,"The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has penned a new blog post aiming to give advice to consumers who may pay for products with digital currencies such as bitcoin.  Written by Kristin Cohen of the FTC's Office of Technology Research and Investigation, the post outlines the types of complaints the US agency receives in relation to the emerging technology.  According to the FTC, these are the most often-cited issues with merchants who accept bitcoin and other digital currencies:  ""The FTC has received hundreds of complaints involving bitcoins and other virtual currencies. The two most common problems? Online merchants who don’t deliver the product on time — or at all — and merchants who give refunds in store credit, rather than currency.""  The post was released with an infographic that sought to illustrate this pain point, showcasing a return process where a consumer spends $100 in bitcoin, only to be refunded $75 due to the fluctuating value of the digital currency.  Cohen goes on to recommend that those who buy items with bitcoin first check the seller's reputation before exploring how the payment will be processed by the merchant.  ""If you pay with bitcoins, the only way to get a refund is through the seller or payment processor, so it’s important to choose companies you trust,"" the post states.  Refund and return  One common problem, the FTC suggests, is the differing ways merchants that accept bitcoin handle the refund process.  Accordingly, Cohen recommends US consumers determine the merchant's policies regarding damaged goods, the exchange rate that will be used for refunds and how the refund will be processed before proceeding with a sale.  ""Because people can change their virtual wallet accounts, a seller can’t always send a bitcoin back to the wallet it came from,"" the agency cautions.  The FTC also instructs consumers to ask how their financial information will be protected given the wallet addresses that execute bitcoin transactions will be available in the technology's public ledger, the blockchain.  ""If the seller uses a payment processor, check its privacy policy, too. A recent FTC report found many shopping apps had privacy policies that included broad rights to collect, use, and share data,"" she continues.  The post concludes with information on how consumers may file complaints with the FTC.  Wake-up call  The FTC's writings were further highlighted in a subsequent advisory issued by law firm Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, LLP to its clients that sought to highlight conclusions for firms operating in the digital currency industry.  Writing on behalf of the firm, Carol Van Cleef and Linda Goldstein suggest that the post could foreshadow more formal actions by the agency against industry participants.  ""The blog post makes clear that the FTC believes it is very important consumers in these transactions be made fully aware of all of the material terms of the merchant’s return and refund policies since these payments do not enjoy the same legal protections as credit card payments,"" the authors write.  Van Cleef and Goldstein sought to portray the advice to consumers as potentially significant for industry merchants and processors.  ""Sellers and processors in consumer transactions involving virtual currency should expect the FTC to scrutinize their privacy policies and procedures like those of sellers and processors in other types of transactions,"" the authors write.  The guidance goes on to conclude that the industry should treat the blog post as a ""wake-up call"" about the need for merchants and processors to address privacy concerns.
