42377822,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73fnh,1416436512,100 Dutch Merchants to Receive Bitcoin Terminals in Startup-Led Giveaway,"In order to claim this prestigious title, BitPay and BitStraat have developed dedicated bitcoin payment terminals, which they are giving away free to 100 brick-and-mortar stores throughout the Dutch capital.      BitStraat, which serves as a middleman linking bitcoin-accepting merchants and payment processors such as BitPay, was founded by Amsterdam residents Max Barendregt and Kasper Keunen.      ""It only makes sense to establish Amsterdam as the global bitcoin capital,"" Barendregt said.      ""The Dutch capital has a history and a name for being technologically ambitious as well as open minded and forward thinking in general. A currency for the people free from centralised control would be a natural fit. We aim to enable visitors to our city to pay for all of their expenses in bitcoin, including their stay in a hostel, their trips to museums and their diner at local restaurants,"" he added.    Community first    Barendregt and Keunen pitched their ambition to the BitPay team at Bitcoin2014, the Bitcoin Foundation-organised conference held in Amsterdam last May.      Having just opened up its European headquarters in Amsterdam a month earlier, BitPay was immediately enthusiastic about the initiative, said director of European business development Moe Levin, explaining:      ""Our community made us, so our philosophy will remain simple: we put our community first. That means supporting any local project that increases adoption, adds awareness, and ultimately drives bitcoin from speculation to mainstream.""              The POS terminals that have been developed for Amsterdam Bitcoin City consist of a small tablet device with specific software installed. This is integrated into a custom-made stand, so it can be easily placed on any counter top.      Since the terminals, their installation and BitPay's payments plan all cost nothing, the whole package is completely free for the first 100 merchants to enroll – up to a monthly revenue of €900.      After that, merchants get the non-committal option to either pay €10 a month for the complete service, or they can purchase the terminal outright for €120.    Interest and competition    Amsterdam Bitcoin City has so far signed up 18 vendors, although not all of them have yet had their payment terminals installed.      Among these bitcoin-accepting locations are Hofje van Wijs, a cafe set to accommodate the first Bitcoin Embassy Amsterdam later this year, and Pakhuis de Zwijger, the event-venue that hosts the city's monthly Bitcoin Wednesday meetup.      BitStraat and BitPay hope to have reached 100 participants by next spring.      In order to become the bitcoin capital of the world, Amsterdam Bitcoin City will first need to surpass another Dutch city, however.      Arnhem's Bitcoincity signed up 15 bitcoin-accepting merchants at its launch in May of this year, and has more than doubled in size to 36 participants since then.      Arnhem Bitcoincity was itself inspired by another Dutch project, the Bitcoin Boulevard in The Hague, which consists of 10 bitcoin-accepting merchants along a single canal.

42377814,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73fg9,1416429076,Bitcoin Foundation Pledges to Focus Solely on Core Development,"The Bitcoin Foundation has announced that it will seek to wind down its education, outreach and public policy initiatives as it turns its focus to core development.  The news coincides with the publication today of three surveys conducted by the Bitcoin Foundation suggesting that many community members, both inside and outside of the organization, want to see it adopt a stronger focus on core development.  The organisation wrote in its official blog posthttps://bitcoinfoundation.org/2014/11/everybody-pivots/:  ""In the beginning, the foundation did it all — public policy, education and outreach, core development — primarily because there was no one else to do it. Thankfully we've come a long way since then and, as the ecosystem matures, just as with any startup, it's time to start shedding hats and specializing.""  The organization said that it would take the results of the surveys to heart and begin shifting its focus toward core development, promising more funding and resources to this aim.  As part of a new push in this direction, the foundation also announced plans to launch educational seminars to get more developers working on core development.  The post explained:  “Some of the practical steps that are underway as we change course are: shedding anything that does not support core development, preparing to bring on at least one additional full-time developer for testing within the next several months, and launching at least four developer training and certification workshops around the world starting 2015.”  Key survey results  The three surveys focused on Bitcoin Foundation members, both business and individual, as well as the general public. A majority of the individual members surveyed reported that they were from Europe and the US, while the business survey – which featured 18 participants – drew mainly from US respondents.  Forty-four percent of the Bitcoin Foundation's individual members asserted that they want to see the trade organisation focus more on core development, according to the results, constituting 106 out of a total 230 respondents. Community members supported core development by wider margins, with 56% supporting training initiatives.  Fifty-two percent of individual members said that supporting the development of bitcoin’s open-source technology is, to them, the most important part of the organization's work. Similar findings were observed in the community and business member surveys, with 56% and 44% of respondents supporting core development, respectively.

42377824,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73fqD,1416427530,Bitreserve Seeks to Raise $10 Million in Crowdfunding Campaign,"Bitreserve is seeking to raise $10m in capital through a new crowdfunding initiative.  The bitcoin storage platform, started by CNET founder Halsey Minor, has raised $7m so far, with 51 days to go on its funding campaign.  Minor said the decision to raise a financing through crowdfunding was a ""supplement"" to other fundraising efforts. He also said it is an attempt to address the limited investment opportunities available to the general public for technology companies like his.  Minor told CoinDesk:  ""People should have a right to invest in innovation ... there are so many things that are just fundamentally flawed. It's like the finance system is still medieval.""  Series B breakdown  Twenty-four investors are listed so far as participants in Bitreserve's funding round on CrowdCubehttps://www.crowdcube.com/company-details/bitreserve-16565, one of two platforms the startup is using for its crowdfunding efforts. CrowdCube is aimed at investors residing in the UK, while the other platform, Venovatehttp://welcome.venovate.com/, targets investors in the US.  The company is also raising money from institutional investors in addition to crowd-sourced funds.  According to Tim Parsa, who was previously chief executive but is now president of global strategy and markets (Minor has assumed the CEO role), seven institutional investors have put money into the round, with the rest coming from the crowdfunding platforms.  Bitreserve is touted as a way for the masses to hold bitcoin without exposure to bitcoin's volatility against fiat currencies. It also promotes its transparency features, which includes a live accounting of its assets and obligations to its users.  Focus on developers and API  When the service opened to the general public on 30th October, it had assets of $166,091, according to its 'Real-time Transparency Page'. At press time, its assets stood at $279,321.  The service has ""thousands"" of users currently, according to Byrne Reese, who heads the firm's product development.  Minor wouldn't reveal Bitreserve's exact user numbers, but he emphasised the platform's attractiveness to third-party developers. He said about 40 developers were using Bitreserve's API to build their own products and services, including two cryptocurrency exchanges that are using the platform for its transparency features.  ""People don't understand the difference between trading, clearing and custody [of funds] ... The whole thing needs to be transparent and banks have no product for that,"" Minor said.  First audit scheduled  When Bitreserve was in the early stages of testing, Minor outlined a plan for users to hold their bitcoin assets on his platform while using it to perform free conversions to popular fiat currencies like US dollars or Japanese yen. The platform would have merchants connected to it who would accept dollars or yen in their own Bitreserve accounts.  However, the plan to sign up merchants hasn't progressed, Minor said. The firm is focusing its efforts on signing up third-party developers instead, with plans for a developer's conference next year.  ""Our goal is to let users hold money in whatever form that is comfortable for them ... [traffic through our API] is what we talk about internally,"" Minor said.  Bitreserve's current financing effort is a Series B round. The firm also raised $5m in an earlier round, according to Reese. Neither Minor nor Reese would disclose the investors or investment firms that participated in that round.  One of the company's transparency pledges is to have its assets audited by an external accounting firm every 90 days. Accountants SingerLewak has been appointed to perform the first audit on 31st December.  In an earlier interview with CoinDesk, Minor said Bitreserve would eventually invest client funds in various asset classes. Now, he says that moment is a long way off, as the startup seeks to build up a large base of cash to safeguard client funds.  Minor said:  ""We need to build up a very large amount of cash that sits on the bottom of the pyramid ... we're less well-known than big companies like Coinbase or Bitstamp. But that gap will close in the next few months. It's a little scary for me, there will always be awkward growing moments, but all of ours will be public – like, really public.""

42377807,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73fW5,1416422129,Finland Classifies Bitcoin as VAT-Exempt Financial Service,"Finnish regulators have classified bitcoin as a financial service, thus granting it VAT-exempt status.  The Finnish Central Board of Taxes (CBT) judged bitcoin to be a financial service in ruling 034/2014, which states that bitcoin purchases qualify as “banking services” under the EU Value Added Tax (VAT) Directive.  The ruling was issued after a court classified bitcoin as a payment instrument and sets Finland’s approach to the cryptocurrency apart from most European jurisdictions, which generally treat bitcoin as a commodity.  However, the nation is not completely alone in taking this approach: Belgium’s Federal Public Service Finance (FPS) issued a similar ruling in September.  What does this mean for Finland?  Richard Asquith, vice president of global tax compliance at Alavara, told the International Tax Reviewthat Finland’s ruling could help change the way bitcoin is viewed domestically.  “By making bitcoins a recognized payment instrument, Finland has pushed it towards being regarded as a formal currency,"" said Asquith.  He warned, however, that the decision, in the absence of EU-wide regulations, could cause more regulatory problems:  ""This would not be welcomed by European central banks as it would trigger wider financial regulation issues.""  For the time being, European regulators and legislators are not making much headway and it is expected that no clear EU-wide rules on bitcoin VAT will be in place for another two years.  Lack of clear EU framework  While not following the general European Union path on this matter, the Finnish ruling does cite the EU VAT Directive. This seeming contradiction is down to the fact that the EU does not have a joint digital currency framework and therefore existing legislation is open to interpretation by individual nations.  Different European countries have taken a variety of approaches to bitcoin taxation and the application of VAT rules. While some seek to apply VAT to all digital currency sales, others simply ignore them, leaving them unregulated in terms of taxation, or apply capital gains or corporate tax on trading or mining profits.  The EU has been looking into digital currencies for some time, but apart from several consumer warnings and opinions, its response has been slow and there is still no push for legislative uniformity across the region.  Earlier this year, however, the European Banking Authority (EBA) warned financial institutions against getting involved in the digital currency space until the industry is regulated.  Back in March, the European Central Bank (ECB) reiterated its previous position on digital currencies, saying that the new technology should not be ignored or dismissed.

Buterin, the developer of crypto 2.0 platform Ethereum and co-founder of Bitcoin Magazine, received the honour at the WTN's 2014 summit held at the Time & Life building in New York City. The event was organised in association with Fortune and Time.  In addition to Ethereum, Buterin has been involved in a number of crypto projects over the years, including Dark Wallet and KryptoKit.  This is not the first time the youthful developer has been rewarded for his efforts, earlier this year Buterin received a $100,000 fellowship from PayPal co-founder and venture capitalist Peter Thiel.  Recognising innovation  Buterin was the only big name in the digital currency industry to win an award at this year's WTN event. However, a number of familiar names from the world of finance and the tech industry also made it to the roster.  Serial entrepreneur Elon Musk won two awards – one in the Energy category, as the chairman of SolarCity and co-founder of Tesla, and another in the Space category, as the founder of SpaceX.  Paul Graham, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris and Trevor Blackwell, the co-founders of Y Combinator, won individual awards in the Finance category. The Corporate Finance award went to 500 Startups. Both companies have previously invested in the bitcoin space.  The World Technology Awards are an annual event with the aim of promoting outstanding innovators in a range of tech industries.

42377812,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73fcN,1416412522,New Research Links Bitcoin Price Spikes to Media Hype,"A new research paper aims to understand bitcoin’s price fluctuations and usage patterns through empirical analysis. Notably, the work finds a positive link between media attention and the value of the cryptocurrency.  “The rise of bitcoin has generated interest from the media and scientific community. However our knowledge of this innovation is still insufficient, particularly when examined from perspectives of finance and economics,” the study says.  To address this gap, the researchers conducted two complementary empirical investigations. The first aimed to clarify the factors affecting the rate of return on investment in bitcoin, while the second examined the sales of merchants who have decided to accept bitcoin as a form of payment.  The work, titled Price Fluctuations and the Use of Bitcoin: An Empirical Inquiry, is the result of a collaboration by Michal Polasik and Anna Piotrowska, two researchers from Poland’s Nicolaus Copernicus University's finance department; Tomasz Piotr Wisniewski and Geoffrey Lightfoot from the University of Leicester School of Management; and Radoslaw Kotkowski, an employee of the Polish Bank Association whose research was conducted independently and is associated with the Warsaw School of Economics.  Lightfoot told CoinDesk that the article is to be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal and that currently the authors are collecting comments from colleagues before the final submission.  According to the authors, their work “enriches and verifies earlier theoretical considerations with data, and is one of the first empirical attempts to model the bitcoin economy”.  Chicken-and-egg scenario  The team's primary objective was to discover what determines bitcoin's value, using data pulled from CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  While constructing the list of potential drivers, the researchers considered standard macroeconomic controls, global stock market fluctuations, and the number of transactions conducted with bitcoin, as well as measures designed to gauge its popularity. These included the number of English-language articles listing the word ‘bitcoin’, as well as the number of Google searches carried out for the same term.  The authors worked with the assumption that popularity drives price changes, but it could be that the opposite is true, they say, particularly when there is a spike in the price. After allowing for this possibility in the analysis, though, the researchers concluded their initial assumption was correct.  They state:  “Our results indicate that popularity of this cryptocurrency is one of the main factors driving the price. We observed that returns tend to be elevated whenever newspaper articles mention bitcoin more frequently and whenever the number of people searching for it on Google increases.”  According to the data, a 1% increase in the number of articles mentioning bitcoin raises returns by around 30 'basis points' (each being 100th of 1%). A similar rise in Google searches increases returns by about 50 basis points.  To further attempted to assess whether the price performance of bitcoin depends on its liquidity, the researchers collected data on the change in total number of transactions on the blockchain.      ""By focusing on price formation, we discover that bitcoin returns are driven primarily by its popularity and the transactional needs of its users,"" say the authors.  At the same time, they add, bitcoin is ""not well integrated with global stock markets and the macroeconomy presumably because it is currently a relative newcomer"". Thus, the link with globals stocks was not found to be significant.  Sales breakdown  The second major part of the study involved the survey of legal, English-speaking, bitcoin-accepting businesses. In total, 108 companies from 35 countries responded with information.  The paper reads:    ""Analysis of traders that operate outside the law is likely to be highly unreliable, both because they are difficult to identify and, even if found, will be unlikely to voluntarily participate in such a survey.""    The data indicated that the value of transactions carried out using bitcoin was on average 31% of sales, with just over half of the surveyed companies registering only a small portion of sales (up to 10%) in the digital currency. However, just over a quarter of merchants claimed that over 81% of their sales were conducted with bitcoin.  ""This group presumably includes organisations that have built their business model around the use of bitcoin,"" the paper adds.  The authors also found that concluded that the cryptocurrency portion of trade was higher for startups (less than three years old) than for presumably more established merchants who maintain brick-and-mortar outlets.  Additionally, customers’ knowledge of bitcoin (as estimated by the merchant) was also a factor: the more buyers knew about the cryptocurrency, the higher the proportion of bitcoin sales.              Obstacles ahead of bitcoin  The authors acknowledge that, according to some researchers, bitcoin has not yet reached critical mass and appears viable primarily as an alternative currency for online purchases. However, the research also takes account of its rapid proliferation.  “The network of entities that accept bitcoin is expanding rapidly and there is a burgeoning technical infrastructure that can ameliorate the problem of exchange rate volatility,” the report says.  With this in mind, the paper points to a number of obstacles that stand in bitcoin’s path to widespread acceptance.  “Perhaps the biggest is the legal status of the cryptocurrency, with some countries maintaining an outright ban while others heavily restricting its use. Alongside this, there is considerable confusion as legislators attempt to determine its status for tax purposes – even within the EU countries there is no common approach.”  This said, the authors’ view on bitcoin’s potential role in the global economy is perhaps best summarised in the study’s concluding paragraph:  “Bitcoin is a fascinating innovation, which through its technical possibilities has the potential to engender significant changes to our understanding of the financial system and of the essence of money ... Time will tell as to whether the benefits will outweigh the shortcomings, and whether adoption will become widespread, or remain limited to narrow niches and the shadow economy.”  More analysis to come      When asked about how the paper compares to another recent study that linked bitcoin price movements to search and media interest, Lightfoot said the two works have certain common features.              “It’s a good paper,” Lightfoot told CoinDesk. “I think both of our papers agree on the importance of publicity as a driver for bitcoin price and returns, although we draw out different implications, since we also call upon our survey of merchants accepting bitcoin.”  What makes the latest research original, he said, is the survey of merchants.  ""We’ll reflect further on it and draw some further parallels in the next version of our paper,"" Lightfoot added.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | RESEARCH,Jaroslaw Adamowski,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/11/19/new-research-links-bitcoin-price-spikes-to-media-hype,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d47267821d467c04b028a829464018c6d5e294c2-1524x824.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377815,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73fdd,1416401990,CryptoLabs Announces Bitcoin Hardware Wallet with Biometric Authentication,"Stealth bitcoin startup CryptoLabs stepped into the public eye this week, announcing it will seek to market Case, a pocket-sized, multi-signature bitcoin hardware wallet, in 2015.  The device, which measures around 86mm by 54mm, will enable users to buy and sell, as well as send and receive, bitcoin. CryptoLabs boasts that, in addition to its compact size, Case will provide the latest in security features, including biometric authentication.  Speaking to CoinDesk, CEO Melanie Shapiro framed the company's first offering as one that strives to strike a balance between the usability of mobile smartphone wallets and the security of existing hardware storage solutions, such as the Trezor wallet.  Shapiro said:  ""The difference is that this is an actual wallet. You can take it with you. Trezor has to be plugged into your computer for you to use it. This plugs into nothing.""  Shapiro indicated that CrytoLabs will begin manufacturing its Case product on 25th November and that the device will be made available for pre-sale in December.  ""There's no development after that,"" Shapiro explained. ""We know we can build it, everything is done. The actual hardware will be done and it will be going down the manufacturing line for actual shipment.""  Shipping is expected to commence next spring, the company said.  The company did not disclose either the weight of the product or the likely price, stating that both are currently to be finalized. However, Shapiro estimated that Case would be ""more expensive than the Trezor"", which retails for $119.  Eliminating trust  Key to CryptoLabs' hardware wallet will be its reliance on multi-signature technology. The device will provide users with three keys, each of which is stored in a different location and secured by a different layer of authentication, one of which will be fingerprint scanning.  ""I think that something that echoes in bitcoin is not having to trust anything,"" Shapiro said. ""We've done everything in our power to make sure you don't have to really trust us.""  These precautions include distributing the three keys for each device, providing one to the end user, one to a server and the other to a cold-storage facility managed by a third party.  ""If there's a hack on a server, [the attacker is] only ever going to have access to one key,"" Shapiro explained. ""You have to get into cold storage and steal the finger off somebody's body to get into their bitcoin. So the security of it is fairly robust.""  Users will be able to access the device using the fingerprint scanner and a camera embedded in each unit. The device's global system for mobile communications (GSM) SIM card will also enable it to be used in more than 60 countries worldwide, according to the company.  Choosing the form factor  One of the core goals of CryptoLabs' design process was to create a hardware wallet that provided consumers with the familiarity of traditional financial products.  ""Even in 2014, when you think about payments, embedded in our minds is the idea of credit card. That shape is what we think of when we think of payments,"" Shapiro said.  As such, Shapiro said it was important to the company that Case should be small enough to fit into a pocket or traditional wallet. She went on to suggest that CryptoLabs will seek to make future versions of its product as thin as a credit card too.  Ultimately, Shapiro expressed her hope that this emphasis on usability and security will help set her company's offering apart from other hardware solutions, adding:  ""This is easy enough for you to use at a coffee shop. You can keep it in your back pocket, but it also has the kind of security [that users need], even more so than ease of use.""  Embracing bitcoin's market challenges  CryptoLabs is also notable given Shapiro's history as an entrepreneur, having sold instant-messaging and social client startup Digsby to San Francisco-based social network Tagged for an undisclosed amount in 2011.  It was following this successful exit and during her tenure studying with Microsoft for her PhD that Shapiro says she first learned about bitcoin on the company's online forums.  Originally from a software background, Shapiro indicated that she began to focus on hardware when considering a venture in the bitcoin space due to her belief that the digital currency's users were underserved.  The unique opportunity to provide bitcoin's enthusiastic early adopters with a product that could improve their lives, she suggested, was also a factor that, in turn, made her excited by the space.  Shapiro concluded:  ""I think there's room in this industry for a leading hardware product and I think that the community is going to react well to this. It solves a number of problems, plus it's cool.""

42377820,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73fjv,1416396489,Factom Outlines Record-Keeping Network That Utilises Bitcoin's Blockchain,"A new white paper from the Factom team outlines a conceptual framework for a system that secures and proves the authenticity of records, documents or other important types of data that are later enshrined on the bitcoin blockchain.  The concept of using the blockchain to cryptographically prove the 'truth' of a piece of information is one of the cornerstones of the crypto 2.0 movement, and the concept itself has been implemented in the past.  Factom, however, proposes a new architecture that exists outside of the bitcoin network, but relies on the digital currency’s globally distributed computing power to keep cryptographically secured information both transparent and globally accessible.  The white paper, written by Paul Snow, Brian Beery, Jack Lu, David Johnston and Peter Kirby, explores an infrastructure in which record keeping – particularly records of ownership – can be moved from a fragmented, primarily manual process to a more digital, automated framework.  A number of well-known reviewers, including Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin and bitcoin mining expert and developer Luke Dashjr, were cited in the paper.  Avoiding blockchain bloat  Factom envisions a peer-to-peer network in which top-level servers build data chains and, after cryptographically processing the information, enshrines them on the bitcoin blockchain using a Merkle root.  The benefit of this approach, the authors say, is that it takes advantage of bitcoin’s cumulative processing power while avoiding the overaccumulation of data – known more commonly as 'blockchain bloat'.  Factom argues that its concept is a solution to situations such as the mortgage claim crisis that took place in the aftermath of the Great Recession in the US.  At the time, originally paper-based titles were mishandled or lost during digital transitions and, as a result, homeowners from a number of states were incorrectly foreclosed and, to this day, thousands of those affected continue to face legal challenges because the chain of title was effectively broken.  Near-term applications, according to the Factom team, include providing a mechanism for improving transparency among existing players in the bitcoin space. Peter Kirby, who serves as Factom’s president, noted during a Reddit Ask Me Anything (AMA) session that his team is already undertaking discussions with interested parties who are looking at his firm’s infrastructure as a potential solution to their problems.  He explained:  “Making exchanges honest is one of the first projects that's being done on Factom. You can run a proof-of-audit on steroids – letting you produce a true audit trail of every transaction at every moment. That'll really get businesses to sit up and notice. The other application that will pop up right away is title records – because they secure such a large portion of a country's wealth.”  While the paper acknowledges that some elements are still under development, including the protocol by which the architecture achieves consensus, the Factom concept constitutes another approach to expanding the capabilities of the bitcoin network.  Multi-layer infrastructure  According to the proposal, the Factom system will ultimately consist of a four-tier architecture designed to both produce verified chains of information and secure that data within the bitcoin blockchain.  This infrastructure is responsible for verifying ownership of 'entry chains', updating the data when changes to chains are made and, at the end of the process, embedding information onto the bitcoin blockchain.  As shown in the diagram below, the proposal calls for the scaled creation of hashed data strings called 'entry blocks', which are managed by the Factom infrastructure and constructed into chains.  The paper explains:  “Chains in Factom are sequences of Entries that reflect the events relevant to an Application. These sequences are at the heart of Bitcoin 2.0. Chains document these event sequences and provide an audit trail recording that an event sequence occurred. With the addition of cryptographic signatures, those events would be proof they originated from a known source.”  In order to power this network, Factom plans to deploy a P2P network of nodes that act as global mechanisms for keeping the system running and efficiently processing Chain updates. Fueling the top-level system will be in-house tokens known as factoids that will be exchanged for Entry Credits that are then used to input data into the system.  Co-author Paul Snow told CoinDesk that the Factom team is designing its infrastructure to handle high transaction volume and that the architecture itself will be comprised of both full nodes containing systemic data and partial nodes that only carry information for certain chains.  Snow continued:  “The Factom node network will be completely distributed, just like bitcoin. Users will be able to run either a full node replicating all the data ... or a partial node replicating only the data needed in specified chains. We are looking at incentives to ensure that data is replicated across the nodes, but all the data does not need to be in every single node.”  Potential applications  The Factom team suggested that its proposal could be leveraged to execute some of the crypto 2.0 functionalities that are beginning to take shape on the market today. These include creating trustless audit chains, property title chains, record keeping for sensitive personal, medical and corporate materials, and public accountability mechanisms.  During the AMA, the Factom president was asked how the technology could be leveraged to shape the average person’s daily life.  Kirby responded:  “Factom creates permanent records that can't be changed later. In a Factom world, there's no more robo-signing scandals. In a Factom world, there are no more missing voting records. In a Factom world, you know where every dollar of government money was spent. Basically, the whole world is made up of record keeping and, as a consumer, you're at the mercy of the fragmented systems that run these records.”  Follow-up comments focused on the legal implications of creating a system by which titles can be cryptographically proven to both exist and be tied to a certain date and time. The team repeatedly invoked the robo-signing scandals, pointing to that crisis as the catalyst for the creation of trustless title chain networks.  Kirby suggested at one point that at least one governmental body, as well as private interests, has established contact and is interested in what the proposal has to offer in terms of potential solutions to problems with legacy title management schemes.  “We've already had a country reach out to us about building a title application using Factom and the bitcoin blockchain,” he said.  Development continues  Several elements of the Factom protocol, as well as mechanisms for incentivizing the node structure, remain in development. Yet, according to the team, the release of the white paper – along with the latest version of the API and a frequently-asked-questions sheet – are intended to spark a conversation that could produce additional insights into how Factom might develop moving forward.  During the AMA, Kirby revealed that the decentralized cloud storage platform Storj, which raised 910 BTC during a crowdsale in August, is weighing whether or not to utilize Factom as a record-keeping mechanism.  Kirby called Storj founder Shawn Wilkinson, who serves as an advisor to the Factom project, an early supporter who “knew about Factom before it was cool”.  The scale of Factom, according to Snow, is also expected to grow, both as the project initially takes shape and in the future. These changes, he told CoinDesk, are incumbent on transaction volume and could require larger servers and a broader node network to handle the data flow.  The Factom team, in both its white paper and during the AMA, suggested that the project could evolve as more developers bring ideas to the table for utilizing the system.  Ultimately, the team writes, the goal is to try to develop a vehicle for the solutions offered by the bitcoin protocol to be brought to market without creating impediments to the healthy growth of the network itself.  As the paper states:  “The dream of many is to extend the honesty inherent to an immutable ledger validated by math to chaotic, real-­world interactions. By allowing the construction of unbounded ledgers backed by the blockchain, Factom extends the benefits of the blockchain to the real world.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/11/19/factom-outlines-record-keeping-network-that-utilises-bitcoins-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/88187c68033875383dda6e400c717a7ec76c2519-2560x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
