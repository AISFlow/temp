42412151,KEYN3b06rsSCg2kKkMIgrr,1634341858,CFTC Fines Tether and Bitfinex $42.5M for ‘Untrue or Misleading’ Claims,"The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) fined Bitfinex and Tether more than $42 million on allegations the USDT stablecoin was not fully backed at all times and that Bitfinex violated a previous agency order.  The federal commodities regulator settled charges with the sibling crypto companies on Friday, barring both firms from “any further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations.”  According to a CFTC press release, Tether’s stablecoin was fully backed by reserves for only one-quarter of the time over a 26-month period between 2016 and 2018. Further, Tether comingled reserve funds with the company’s corporate funds and held reserves in non-cash products.  “At various times, Tether maintained some of the Tether Reserves in bank accounts other than the Tether Bank Accounts. Tether represents that, at times, it also included receivables and non-fiat assets among its counted reserves; and further represents that Tether has not failed to satisfy a redemption request for tether tokens,” an order attached to the release said.  The New York Attorney General’s office reported similar findings in an investigation into Tether and Bitfinex that was settled earlier this year.  “The order also finds that, instead of holding all USDT token reserves in U.S. dollars as represented, Tether relied upon unregulated entities and certain third-parties to hold funds comprising the reserves,” the press release said.  Spokespeople for Tether and Bitfinex did not immediately return a request for comment.  In a statement published shortly after the CFTC release, the firm contested the claims.  “As to the Tether reserves, there is no finding that tether tokens were not fully backed at all times – simply that the reserves were not all in cash and all in a bank account titled in Tether’s name, at all times. As Tether represented in the Order, it has always maintained adequate reserves and has never failed to satisfy a redemption request,” Tether wrote.  The CFTC said it also settled commodities charges against Bitfinex in a simultaneous action.  “The order finds Bitfinex engaged in illegal, off-exchange retail commodity transactions in digital assets with U.S persons on the Bitfinex trading platform and operated as a futures commission merchant (FCM) without registering as required,” a press release said.  Bitfinex will pay $1.5 million and institute “additional systems” to ensure it does not facilitate unlawful commodities transactions again, the press release said.  In a concurring statement, CFTC Commissioner Dawn Stump said she agreed with the agency’s findings but expressed concern about the CFTC’s role in regulating stablecoins specifically.  “We should seek to ensure the public understands that we do not regulate stablecoins and we do not have daily insight into the businesses of those who issue such,” Stump said. “But in pursuing and settling this matter, do we provide users of stablecoins with a false sense of comfort that we are overseeing those who issue and sell these coins such that they are protected from wrongdoing?”  Stump questioned whether the CFTC was broadening its jurisdiction versus protecting investors.

Of course, the majority of these efforts (if not all) were futile - caused by waning demand during downturns, opposition from government entities, or the general uncertainty surrounding crypto&apos;s future as an asset class.

Michael Hsu, who replaced Brooks as Comptroller in May, signaled greater caution on crypto, telling the House Financial Services Committee that he planned to keep an open mind on crypto but would be reviewing actions taken under Brooks’ leadership to ensure banks remained safe for consumers.

Here is a closer look at what the tool says, the only remaining timeframe without a buy signal, and more information on what the Supertrend technical indicator does. What The Supertrend Says About The Bitcoin Bull Run When Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are trending, they move fast and hard.

Trends take place across multiple timeframes. For example, a short-term downtrend on daily timeframes might last weeks, while a monthly downtrend could take years to turn around. The same is true for the opposite direction, which is what bears missed this time around.

42394402,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvczQ7,1634318740,NFTs Are an Internet Game-Changer,"When they look at non-fungible tokens, non-crypto “normies” in the mainstream tend to focus on the mind-blowing prices that have been paid for digital art and the fanaticism around avatar communities such as the $542 million in sales of Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs. They wonder what all the fuss is about.  If they were to pick up on the many other applications that are now being explored – from renting out your digital gaming assets to selling your DNA – they might recognize that something more profound is afoot. Even though, for now, speculation appears to be the biggest use case for NFTs, they offer something far bigger: the foundation for a new digital economy.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  To dig into why, it’s worth looking at why people misunderstand the appeal of NFTs, which I think stems from an insufficient understanding of how the digital economy works and doesn’t work.  Rights  Consider a common dismissive response to the NFT buying frenzy. People ask, “Why on Earth would someone pay millions of dollars for a JPEG that I can simply ‘right-click/save’ to my hard drive?”  The problem with that statement is it confuses possession of a digital file with rights to the artwork or information contained within it. It’s the latter that NFTs offer, creating provably scarce digital markers of value and providing a vital building block for a better system of rights enforcement.  This is a big prospect, because in the pre-Bitcoin internet creators largely forfeited their capacity to directly assign rights to their work to customers who paid for it. That stems largely from legal determinations around copyright that were made in the early days of internet commerce. At that time, there were no decentralized systems for tracking transactions and preventing double-counting. The century-old first sale doctrine, which laid down the rights of both creators and consumers of copyrighted content, did not apply to digital media because the content could be easily replicated in an internet environment.  In the physical realm, that doctrine held that while a person couldn’t, say, replicate a copyrighted text and publish new copies of it without copyright owners granting them a license to do so, they could resell a book in which that text appears, transferring total control and ownership to a new owner. Thus, the doctrine distinguishes between the copyright attached to a digital work and the vessel, such as book or record, in which works drawn from that copyright reside.  On the internet, anonymity, coupled with the low cost of digital replication, meant it was trivial to copy a work and easy to avoid enforcement. As such, early digital media came to be controlled through licenses. You never actually owned an MP3 or a Kindle book, you were simply given perpetual rights to single, non-commercial use. For the longest time, you couldn’t transfer those rights to anyone else.  Then, as social media took off, as everyone became a creator of “user-generated content,” Facebook, Twitter and other platforms used that principle to their advantage. Their terms and service essentially required users to sign away their copyright, allowing their content to be shared, retweeted and repurposed within the platform without restriction.  This generated a massive network effect for the most successful platforms because they became the primary source of information for the general public. In turn, it meant that commercial creators, including everyone from large news organizations to professional photographers and artists, felt compelled to publish their content on the platforms under the same open-sharing terms.  In doing so, they lost a direct relationship with their audience. Control over market data for creative content was now in the hands of Facebook, Google, Twitter and Amazon, not the creators. With that data as a carrot, the platforms drew advertisers away from the publishers. It’s a key reason why so many newspapers and other legacy publications died.  Enter NFTs  NFTs have the potential to help bring creator rights back to where they were before the arrival of the internet. They are, however, only part of the solution.  They don’t in and of themselves stop you from “right-click/saving” a JPEG. Piracy is still easy.  Also – and this is one with which the mainstream observers naturally struggle – an NFT is not the digital media file itself. It is the non-replicable digital signature authenticating a unique, one-off association with a digital file. When you sell an NFT what you sell is, well, the NFT. As to what you or the buyer can do with the art, that depends on what media rights the copyright owner grants along with the NFT.  This might sound like we’re back where we started. But, no. By establishing provably unique, scarce digital markers for the first time, NFTs are a game-changer. They will ultimately allow the creator – and all owners of property that can be expressed in digital form – to reassert their property rights, recovering a power that was lost, or at least severely deprecated, in the Internet 2.0 era. It’s a means to restore a direct relationship with their audience.  As of now, creators will still face the challenge of finding a market, which in theory could leave them dependent on the old internet platforms or the new NFT marketplace platforms to connect with networks of users as potential buyers.  But that challenge is already being addressed in a decentralized manner by the formation of NFT communities and decentralized autonomous organizations that function as creative collectives. As a person with the Twitter handle “6529″ noted in a popularthread last week, the greatest power of NFTs is that they “can be used to build decentralized social organizations.”  The boom to come  Property rights are the foundation of capitalism. Once established, all sorts of business models can be built on top of them. China’s spectacular transformation from destitute Communist backwater to global powerhouse can be traced directly to the moment when it decided to recognize its citizens’ property rights.  In this case, it means individual creators and anyone who owns any digital asset – including a digital record of their genome – can now tap the value-creating power of software, exploit the global reach of the internet, and mine the data that it produces.  This is what the platforms have been doing for decades to create their monopolies. It will now come available to individuals.  This is why NFTs are so revolutionary.

42394398,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvcz5b,1634317593,$2T and Counting: Some Friday Perspective,"Nic Carter, prominent industry venture capitalist and shyguy, had an insightful comment yesterday about how it’s easy to lose sight of reality when you’re logged on, heads down focused on building the digital tomorrow. It was in an article about tungsten – the latest obsession among many on Crypto Twitter.  “Focusing on metals is funny because, like, we’re dealing with synthetic stuff all day, right? So, like, why not just recenter on some analog physical goods every now and again. That’s the joke,” he said.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Of course, crypto isn’t the only online community to realize the importance of stepping back now and again. Before there was touching tungsten, there was touching “grass.” The internet, with its enclaves, pseudo-anonymity and torrent of information has its psychological effects. It’s reshaping our memory, changing the quality of our friendships and, in what’s called the “disinhibition effect,” may be making us meaner.  Getting a little perspective on that is important. This is especially true in crypto, where digital pet rock NFTs (non-fungible tokens) sell for millions of dollars and governments call stablecoins “systemic risks.” It’s surreal, but it’s happening.  Some of this weirdness stems from the sheer amount of capital in the industry – now valued well above $2 trillion. Maybe it’s because we’ve seen it before, or maybe it’s that the human mind is just bad at conceptualizing large numbers, but that number means almost nothing to me. I can’t be the only one that has become so desensitized.  Sometimes it helps to put crypto in context. I’ve tried to find analogies so we can tie back to reality just for a moment.

That would have paid for two decades of war in Afghanistan, according to researchers at Brown University’s Costs of War Project. America’s longest conflict is estimated conservatively to have cost $2.3 trillion.  Bitcoin cash (BCH), the unit of account for the payments-focused fork of the Bitcoin blockchain, is currently trading at or around $600. That’s the price for one pound of the world’s most expensive cheese, Pule donkey cheese, which is produced by a single farm in Serbia’s Zasavica Special Nature Reserve.  Last month, community members that sprung up around the text-based NFT game Loot, developed by Vine co-creator Dom Hofmann, issued 10,000 adventure gold (AGLD) tokens to NFT holders. Those airdropped tokens are now worth $35,900 at today’s price level, which can no longer buy you an entry-level Tesla.  Bitcoin trotted above $60,000 today following news an exchange-traded fund (ETF) could hit markets next week, before dropping back down, then back up. No matter, BTC is still in the ballpark of costs associated with feeding an elephant for a year.  On May 22, 2010, early bitcoin miner Laszlo Hanyecz bought two Papa Johns pizzas for 10,000 BTC. Had Hanyecz held onto those bitcoins instead, today the coins would have been worth $598,311,000. That was the projected cost to build the original Prince George Hotel in New York City in 1917.  Uniswap, the largest decentralized exchange, expended some 1,500 ETH in gas fees (the price paid to run transactions on the Ethereum blockchain) over the past 30 days, according to data site Gas Station.

42412148,KEYN3b06rsSCg2kKkMIgnP,1634311929,"PoolTogether Launches v4: More Prizes, Better Odds and Aggregated Liquidity","Popular decentralized finance (DeFi) no-loss savings game PoolTogether has overhauled their architecture with the launch of its v4, a protocol upgrade tailored to the little guy.  For users, the most important changes coming refers to wins percentages.  “The problem we have is that when we launched the POOL token, we initially got a lot of growth, and we got some big prizes. We were giving away $100,000 to $200,000 a week – we still are. But it was highly, highly constrained due to technical reasons in terms of how many prizes could be awarded per week,” said PoolTogether co-founder Leighton Cusack in an interview with CoinDesk.  A $100,000 prize, for instance, could only be split a maximum of five ways. This puts smaller depositors at a disadvantage because odds are weighted proportionally to deposits, meaning large depositor whales consistently won the pool earnings.  However, PoolTogether’s new architecture allows for greater fractionalization of winnings – upwards of a thousand prizes from an earnings pool – giving smaller depositors a much higher chance of nabbing prizes.  “Someone who had $1,000 right now into the USDC prize pool would have a 0.01% chance of winning a prize every week. That’s a less than 1% chance of winning a prize a year,” Cusack said. “With the new PoolTogether, someone with $1,000 deposited will have a 10% chance of winning a prize each week.”  PoolTogether’s governance will have control over the number of prizes and their amounts, and can even put a cap on the number of prizes that large depositors, or ‘whales,’ can win – where they once might have swept an entire prize pool, they can instead only claim the major prizes, leaving smaller sums for smaller depositors.  Aggregated Liquidity  Smaller depositors will also be able to benefit from cross-chain liquidity. Like many protocols that have simply deployed implementations of their code, PoolTogether has deployed versions on popular sidechains like Polygon, Celo and Binance. However, despite gas efficiencies, the largest prizes are clustered on Ethereum.  V4 will have the chains interact and aggregate deposits, allowing smaller users to take advantage of cheap gas costs while still having a chance at the largest prize pools.  “Regardless of what chain you join on, you will have the same chance to win the same prize,” Cusack said.  What this means is that the protocol is now ultimately tailored to smaller depositors and users overall – an architecture Cusack hopes will create a flywheel effect: currently, as prizes have grown larger, depositors have been discouraged by their slim chances of winning. That may turn around now that the odds are more in their favor and gas costs are lower.  “If you look at how prize savings accounts work in the ‘real’ world, this is how they’re designed. This is a much more true instantiation of what a prize savings account is. I think this is going to be much, much more appealing to someone who wants to get into DeFi,” said Cusack.  He noted that a U.K. prize savings account program, Premium Bonds, hold over $100 billion and has become an enormously popular savings method:  “This is something that’s been around and is super popular, and this works way better on a blockchain,” he added. “To really break out, to get to one billion, two billion, ten billion, [dollars] we needed this architecture, and now thousands of people can win each week.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MATIC | BNB | FORKS,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/15/pooltogether-launches-v4-more-prizes-better-odds-and-aggregated-liquidity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f01e53839e9adf194b4b823f18a1d5afb02bcda5-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Davidson, the Wall Street investment banking and research firm, launched research coverage of bitcoin mining companies Core Scientific, Marathon Digital, Riot Blockchain and Hut 8 Mining with buy ratings for all the stocks.  D.A. Davidson analyst Christopher Brendler sees a “huge opportunity” for the domestic miners, after bitcoin’s sustained rally and China’s sweeping crypto bans. Brendler was previously at Seaport Global and Stifel Nicolaus.  “Combined with improved access to capital that’s sustaining their lead (and ‘HODL’), we expected these stocks to revalue much higher as earnings estimates crush near-term estimates, even if bitcoin consolidates,” Brendler wrote.  With U.S. miners gaining market share after China’s bans and with bitcoin above $55,000, the companies are “literally printing money.”  The miners’ stocks, which are highly correlated with the price of bitcoin, have seen a relentless rally this year as the price of the largest cryptocurrency more than doubled. Meanwhile, the Viridi Cleaner Energy Crypto-Mining & Semiconductor ETF, or RIGZ, which has heavy exposure to the miners and was launched in July, has gained 47%.  “Bitcoin mining stocks are highly (~70%) correlated with bitcoin prices with good reason since BTC not only directly drives reported revenue, but all four also try to hold as much newly-minted bitcoin as possible in their balance sheet,” the analyst wrote.

42412185,KEYN3b06rsSCg2kKkMIhRT,1634303793,Argentinian Entrepreneur Tries to Take His Tipping App Global With Lightning Network,"Damian Catanzaro, a 26-year-old Argentinian programmer, created a sensation among Argentinian contentcreators and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) with Cafecito, a tipping platform he started in February 2020 that’s reached 300,000 users.  But now he wants to go global after recently integrating the Lightning Network, a layer 2 payment product built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain.  Catanzaro developed Cafecito – the name is a Spanish word that refers to a small cup of coffee – when he was looking for ways to monetize the educational programming content he was publishing in his social networks, especially Twitter.  “I found that there were a lot of crowdfunding platforms from abroad, like Patreon. There was one in particular that focused on buying cafecitos named Buy Me a Coffee. The model was good, but there was nothing for Argentina,” Catanzaro recalled, given that the Y Combinator-backed Buy Me a Coffee was based in San Francisco.  Due to its lack of U.S. dollar reserves, Argentina makes it difficult to use platforms that must be funded with foreign currencies.  Within a week, Catanzaro developed an initial version of Cafecito, which only contained his profile and was linked to MercadoPago, the payments processor of e-commerce giant MercadoLibre, allowing people to send Argentinian pesos to the programmer. Its business model consists of charging 5% of the tip given to the creator, while the payment processor, MercadoPago, keeps another percentage of the total received, Catanzaro said.  “After launching the product, a lot of people started talking to me telling me they wanted to have a profile on Cafecito, and that’s when I became interested in the idea to see how it would turn out,” said Catanzaro, who left his other jobs as a programmer to dedicate himself full-time to the fast-growing project.  On May 29, 2020, Catanzaro launched the first version of Cafecito for the public. “From that day on, the platform started to grow a lot, every day,” he said. Since January of this year, it has recorded monthly growth of 30% and currently has 300,000 users.  However, a new world opened up for Catanzaro last week when he integrated the Lightning Network into the platform by enabling a worldwide market for his platform.  Cataranzo first came up with the idea in 2020, but didn’t implement it until this month. The first time he came to Lightning Network, he discovered “a huge, gigantic world already developed with payments.”  Catanzaro decided to use the Open Node platform to integrate the Lightning Network, which he did himself. “I already made the first demo and next week I will open a beta for 1,000 users,” he said.  “The whole crypto ecosystem, most of all the bitcoin ecosystem, thanked me, and a lot of non-crypto entrepreneurs also told me that the development was really cool. It’s something that didn’t exist. The response was super positive,” he said.  According to Catanzaro, none of his potential tipping competitors from abroad have integrated crypto payment options. And while Twitter recently introduced a feature where users can easily tip each other in bitcoin via the Strike payment network, Strike is only available right now to people in the U.S. and El Salvador.  “It’s a long way to go before it’s a worldwide thing,” Catanzaro said of tipping in crypto on Twitter.  Nevertheless, when Catanzaro first heard of Twitter’s tipping feature, he thought Cafecito could be brought on board with that initiative. “In fact, I sent an email to several people at Twitter to see if they would be interested in collaborating and integrating Cafecito as another option. I have not received any response yet,” he said.  Next steps  So far, the programmer has not spent a dollar of advertising on Cafecito. “It was like a snowball. When someone joins, they share it on social networks and it is seen by someone who is interested in the project. And they end up coming to the platform organically,” he said.  Catanzaro plans to expand Cafecito’s model throughout Latin America during 2022 so that people in the region can use the platform to tip creators with local means of payment rather than U.S. dollars.  “There is a lot of paperwork and bureaucracy to open companies elsewhere, but next year everything will be ready for expansion,” said Catanzaro, who identified Mexico as the first country outside Argentina where Cafecito will launch.  Before he integrated Cafecito with the Lightning Network, Catanzaro was planning for Cafecito to be a regional player. “But bitcoin is going to be global,” he said, adding that now he intends to translate the platform into English, although the name, Cafecito, will remain the same.  In the future, Catanzaro plans to make Cafecito a social network, where people can not only leave a tip but also follow users and comment or like posts on walls.  Given the platform’s growth, many venture capitalists have approached Catanzaro, but he has declined offers, arguing that the platform generates enough funds to keep growing via bootstrapping.  “I don’t need a big capital injection. I could take it, but I’m not interested,” he said. “I like to follow this path. I think it’s the right one.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET,Andrés Engler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/15/an-argentine-entrepreneur-tries-to-take-his-tipping-app-global-with-the-lightning-network,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5e387f0daaeeb855e2bf7bf50d0e41dcded80f93-3024x4032.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The companies covered by the index provider’s research have a combined market capitalization of $7.1 trillion, Bloomberg reported Thursday.  The roster includes firms directly involving in the buying and selling of crypto, such as exchange Coinbase, and firms with an allocation of cryptocurrency on their balance sheets, such as business-intelligence software firm MicroStrategy.  While those two are among the most obvious examples of crypto exposure, MSCI highlighted in a blog post Wednesday that equity investors may be faced with “creeping” cryptocurrency exposure.  “This can occur when newly listed cryptocurrency companies get added to the indexes that guide their investments, or when companies in which they are already invested, directly or through indexes, announce strategies that include bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.”  In particular, the governance of cryptocurrencies may present new challenges to companies and investors, given their decentralized nature.  “At a minimum, investors may benefit from understanding how managers and directors of cryptocurrency-exposed companies are monitoring developments in these informal governance frameworks. For companies with more significant exposure, investor interests may be better served by being more actively involved,” MSCI said.

Seeking “vertical coexistence,” with other payment methods used by the public, a CBDC should be made of “relatively plan, easy-to-cook material,” Shinichi Uchida said on Friday.  The central bank official cited an example in which a CBDC could be used within a digital wallet provided by a private company.  “There are various options, but the Bank of Japan would like to work with you to draw an overall picture of the payment system when the CBDC exists,” he said.  The director said the priority of the central bank is that the addition of a CBDC should enable competition between private payment systems providers, while also being universally accessible by the public.  This position was also stressed in a statement, which was released on Wednesday, by the finance officials of the G7.  Uchida added in his speech that the BoJ has “no plans to issue a CBDC at this time,” but that not issuing one would still leave the central bank with the task of building a payment system fit for the future.

42424488,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2p73h,1634259624,Crypto Traders to Blame for 300% Sales Spike at Midwest Tungsten Service,"Crypto meme lords have ignited a run on tungsten cubes.  A two-day-old Twitter joke – “Crypto Traders to Blame for Global Tungsten Shortage” – is trending toward reality – at least if that reality is limited to desk tchotchkes.  It’s also forcing the Illinois manufacturer behind tungsten.com to grapple with an unexpected retail buying spree and consider new payment options. Midwest Tungsten Service’s stock of tungsten cubes on Amazon is now fully depleted, Director of Ecommerce Sean Murray told CoinDesk in a phone call.  He said he plans to restock. Why not? Retail cube sales are up over 300% this week, Murray said. Midwest is even considering accepting bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies in homage to the Crypto Twitter–driven sales surge. Murray said he’d “immediately” convert it to fiat, however.  It’s a “quantifiable” sales jump for a behind-the-scenes company that gets the bulk of its business from industrial customers. Most of Midwest’s clientele seek tungsten – symbol W on the periodic table – as a radiation-shielding, ballast-distributing, specialty metal.  But the crypto traders aren’t welding alloys. They’re aping into a meme. Deceivingly heavy tungsten cubes are the new “it” toy among Twitter’s crypto crowd.  Since at least Tuesday, influential accounts, shitposting whales and day traders have been preaching and buying tungsten cubes.  “Pure unsolicited obsession with the density” drove CMS Holdings’ Dan Matuszewski to tungsten cubes, the trader said over Twitter DMs. He’s already bought a four-inch cube that weighs 41 pounds from Midwest Tungsten.  It cost $3,000.  On Wednesday, he emailed Murray asking if Midwest Tungsten could make a bigger cube.  “Trying to see if we can get a 7incher,” Matuszewski told CoinDesk. He told Midwest’s Murray via email that anything larger is “probably too heavy to manage.”  Meme goes IRL  “I think my first inkling [of the meme] was somebody left a voicemail on one of my colleague’s phones” on Tuesday, Murray said. That caller mentioned two things: Twitter and crypto. Or was it bitcoin? Murray couldn’t be sure.  It didn’t matter. A phony Bloomberg post tweeted by Coin Center’s Neeraj Agrawal seemingly warned of impending tungsten shortages that day. The meme quickly went viral.  “I will take credit a little bit for the recent surge,” Agrawal, one of Crypto Twitter’s most visible personalities, told CoinDesk in a call. “I think it triggered to the rest of Crypto Twitter that, like, ‘Alright, we’re doing something now. We’re doing a thing. We’re all buying these cubes.’”  Crypto has had its tungsten moments before, however.  Castle Island Ventures’ Nic Carter, who has hawked the metal on Twitter for years, is the original tungsten man, Agrawal said, noting Carter’s tungsten post went viral long before his. Matuszewski agreed: Carter is tungsten’s “patient 0.”  Carter’s affection with tungsten runs so deep that he gives cubes out as Christmas presents, he told CoinDesk. People love it because it’s so surprisingly heavy, he added. He loves it because it is a “sophisticated” yet simple status symbol – far better than a watch. Tungsten has about the same density as gold, he pointed out.  Tangible tungsten cubes also provide a respite from the metaverse.  “Focusing on metals is funny because, like, we’re dealing with synthetic stuff all day, right? So, like, why not just recenter on some analog physical goods every now and again. That’s the joke,” he said.  Booming business  Midwest Tungsten Service is going to keep the cubes coming. It has plenty of tungsten to spare, Murray said. He’s preparing a new cube shipment for the Amazon warehouse.  “We’re just kind of trying to stay in our lane, being tungsten manufacturers, and trying to make sure that we are providing good service with this definitely larger number of fulfillments that we’re trying to send out,” he said.  There might even be a special edition 14-inch cube that would weigh over 1,700 pounds. It would be the single-largest tungsten piece Midwest has ever made, Murray said.  One of the issues preventing that plan is questions over how to ship something so small yet so heavy.  “I don’t have a cube, I don’t really know how good the feeling really is,” Agrawal admitted. He’s considering buying one. But he has no interest in the one-inchers. “I’m not going to get a cube and then have someone else have a bigger cube.”  Minutes after his interview with CoinDesk, Agrawal gave in.  “I just bought a cube,” he wrote in an email, “screw it.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/15/crypto-traders-to-blame-for-300-sales-spike-at-midwest-tungsten-service,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b0866e15a4a4042e4de06b82ad926f815c52235b-1600x1200.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
