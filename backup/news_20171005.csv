42427841,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4KRh,1507240821,BlackRock Exec: No Point in Bitcoin ETF,"An executive for the world's largest asset manager said this week that he doesn't see the case for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).  Speaking with Bloomberg on October 3, Mark Wiedman, who serves as Global Head of iShares and Index Investments for BlackRock, was asked about his views on the prospects of a cryptocurrency-tied ETF. A number of firms have attempted to launch such a product, but to date the SEC has been largely dismissive of the concept, issuing notable rejections in the public and, in other cases, prompting some bitcoin ETF backers to withdraw their efforts.  Wiedman said in the interview that he doesn't see it happening, citing other ETF-related products that the firm would encourage clients to hold ""in perpetuity."" In the case of bitcoin, Wiedman said that he ""would not encourage a client to hold bitcoin in perpetuity.""  On the question of an ETF specifically, Wiedman went on to say:  ""I don’t quite get the point of a bitcoin ETF in any case, because we’re talking about...trading products that are difficult to access. If bitcoin is ever successful – and again not my thing but – I wouldn’t recommend it. But if it were [successful], why would you need an ETF to access it?""  Wiedman isn't the only BlackRock executive to comment on cryptocurrencies this week.  That same day, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink was quoted as saying that he is a ""big believer"" in the potential of cryptocurrencies. That said, he took aim at the speculation in the market and suggested that cryptocurrencies are being buoyed by money laundering.

42427838,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4KFh,1507235456,Wikipedia Founder: ICOs Can Be 'Absolute Scams',"The founder of Wikipedia had some harsh words for initial coin offerings (ICOs) in a new interview this morning.  Jimmy Wales, speaking on CNBC, said that he thinks many ICOs – through which cryptographic tokens are sold to fund the bootstrapping and development of a new blockchain network – are ""absolute scams.""  ""There are a lot of these initial coin offerings which are in my opinion are absolute scams and people should be very wary of things that are going on in that area,"" he told the network.  That said, he said the underlying technology behind such offerings is ""super interesting,"" going so far as to say that blockchain will """"be with us for some time to come,"" according to CNBC.  Wales' comments echo those issued by other observers in the space, including those given in the past week by Jay Clayton, the head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Speaking before Congress earlier this week, Clayton argued that the risk of fraud is worse than in the heyday of penny stock scams.  ""Pump-and-dump – it’s actually easier here than it is in the penny stock area, because it’s all electronic, it’s all anonymous, [and] it’s harder to catch the bad guys at the end of the day,"" he said at the time.  In July, the SEC released guidance noting that digital tokens could be treated like securities, and were ""subject to the requirements of the federal securities law"" under certain circumstances, and a number of other regulators have issued similar statements in recent months.  In contrast, other governments such China and South Korea have gone as far as banning the use of the funding model altogether.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), along with the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) trade group, today unveiled a new set of distributed ledger prototypes that form the second phase of ""Project Ubin,"" an initiative that began last year with the goal of testing how a tokenized version of the Singaporean dollar could be created.  To date, the MAS has taken a more proactive approach to its work with blockchain compared to some central banks. Its research dates back to as early as 2015, when the regulator revealed that it was looking at uses that included leveraging the tech for record-keeping purposes.  Based on new statements, Project Ubin has grown to include prototype tools from all parts of the interbank settlement process.  As the regulator explained:  ""The three software models developed are amongst the first in the world to implement decentralized netting of payments in a manner that preserves transactional privacy. Existing netting programmes used in inter-bank payments rely on a single payment queue visible to the operator to find offsetting payments. Decentralizing the queue, however, potentially exposes payment details to an unauthorized party. The latest models in Project Ubin achieve a superior combination of decentralization and privacy.""  The regulator's chief fintech officer, Sopnendu Mohanty, expressed hope that the release would spark further research developments, including those between the MAS and other institutions like it.  ""We are sharing our learnings and knowledge from Project Ubin to encourage greater experimentation amongst central banks and financial institutions. We look forward to working with other central banks on the use of DLT for cross-border applications,"" Mohanty said.  The information release is the latest development from the MAS that finds it shaping its blockchain strategy. MAS officials released a statement on initial coin offerings (ICOs), or sales in which cryptographic tokens are sold in order to fund or bootstrap a new blockchain network.  Per the statement, the MAS believes that some tokens sales fall under the definition of a securities offering, triggering reporting requirements for those involved.

42427835,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4KDh,1507224585,Circle Is Building a Master Mobile Payments Network on Ethereum,"Blockchain startup Circle has unveiled new software aimed at connecting the world's digital wallets.  Known as 'CENTRE', the project seeks to create a way for digital wallets (like Venmo, Alipay or the startup's own Circle Pay) to communicate with one another. Put more simply, CENTRE as envisioned would let the companies behind those apps to transmit and settle funds between them.  At its heart, the project targets the so-called ""walled garden"" issue, wherein different platforms – whether they be a social media site like Facebook or a payments app like Venmo – exist largely within their own ecosystems. Circle is aiming to build a bridge between them, betting that it would make for a more inclusive consumer payments environment.  Circle released today a new white paper outlining the specifications and intended use for CENTRE, which notes that the project has grown since being established as an internal method for transacting in both cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies in digital form. Notably, the startup is planning to develop a new implementation of CENTRE on top of the ethereum network, complete with its own ERC-20 token, the CENT.  CENTRE makes further use of the token standard, however, as node operators – whether they be an app operator, a bank or another financial institution – could issue their own ERC-20 tokens tied to a particular fiat currency to send between other parties on the CENTRE network.  Transactions between nodes would be settled through smart contracts, or self-executing pieces of code that trigger when certain conditions are met. That the startup would move in this direction is perhaps unsurprising – last December, Circle revealed its work on ""Spark"", a smart contract platform it uses to settle transactions.  CENT, according to the paper, is meant to act as a common medium of exchange between apps that originally use entirely incompatible currencies. This means that while nodes aren't required to accept, say, a USD-tied token issued on ethereum by another party on the CENTRE network, they do, by default, have to accept the CENT.  The startup explains:    ""The CENTRE Token, in addition to its other uses (such as accessing the service provider protocol), provides a way for wallets which have no fiat tokens in common to transact, as they will be able to use CENTRE Tokens to obtain the needed fiat token in common to transact.""      Circle is planning to create a CENTRE Foundation to spearhead development of the initiative, and the establishment of that nonprofit group is expected to happen in the coming months.    Though it's unclear who will make the shift, the startup said that ""several key Circle employees"" are expected to form the foundation's early leadership team.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Circle.

42427851,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4Khh,1507221058,Losing Steam? Dash Price Rallies Over $300 But Upside in Doubt,"With a rally in bitcoin pushing up the wider cryptocurrency asset class, dash is back above $300.  At press time, the dash-US dollar (DASH/USD) exchange rate is down over the last week (as expected) falling to $285 on October 3; its lowest level since September 17. The cryptocurrency is now trading at $306; down 1.6 percent in the last 24 hours as per CoinMarketCap.  Yet, the sell-off seen over the last week serves to highlight a peculiarity of the cryptocurrency – that is proving somewhat disconnected with the broader market. For example, while bitcoin remained strongly bid over the weekend, dash suffered losses.  One possible explanation for the behavior, however, is that the market is becoming more conscious that dash is seeking to compete with bitcoin as a payment network focused on consumer transactions.  As the bitcoin blockchain has hung tightly to limitations on network storage (see: the scaling debate), other blockchains, dash included, are seeking to compete. At press time, the average dash transaction fee was $0.02, or about $1.50 at current prices.  Larger debates about blockchain mechanics aside, dash could remain well bid above $300, and any signs that this value proposition is strengthening could potentially lead it to act as a viable bitcoin hedge.  However, the price action analysis suggests, the uptick in dash could run out of steam around $320 levels.  4-hour chart  Daily chart  The chart above shows:  5-day moving average and 10-day moving average is sloping downwards. Thus, upticks above $320 could be short-lived.  The 50-day moving average is still sloping upwards and currently, stands at $323 levels.  View  In the short-run, a move to $320-330 looks likely. Caution is advised above $320 levels as the 10-day moving average is still sloping downwards.  Only two consecutive days-end close above the 50-day moving average would open doors for a rally to $373 levels (Sep 27 high).

The news came to light yesterday, when the operator of torrent site ProxyBunker told TorrentFreak that Cloudflare had moved to remove all its relevant domains due to a miner hiding in the website's code. A portal to other torrent sites, ProxyBunker had been running the ""Coinhive"" monero miner for four days prior to the suspension.  Justin Paine, head of trust and safety at Cloudflare, reportedly told ProxyBunker that the decision was taken because the miner was operating in secret, with no option for visitors to disable the code, and was thus considered ""malware.""  Paine was quoted as saying:  ""Multiple domains in your account were injecting Coinhive mining code without notifying users. ... We consider this to be malware, and as such the account was suspended, and all domains removed from Cloudflare.""  A website miner works by tapping the processing power of visitors' computers to mine cryptocurrencies. This particular process has gained notoriety in recent days, given instances such as torrent site The Pirate Bay's controversial decision to launch a Web-based miner, which was later removed following a public outcry.  Perhaps more notably, well-known companies like TV content provider Showtime have reportedly had mining malware hidden on their websites, stealing processing power from unwitting users.  Further, the number of torrent sites running mining code has reportedly increased.  The trend has been met with mixed responses, but according to TorrentFreak, website miners could serve as a novel financing method for low-profit services, such as torrents. Yesterday, torrent website PassThePopcorn announced it will be introducing an ""opt-in"" version of the software as a way of funding its service.

42427849,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4Kjh,1507209140,"Above $4,300: Bitcoin Is Up, But Is It Out of the Woods?","The bitcoin-US dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate is gaining altitude after the bearish Doji reversal seen earlier this week failed to keep the cryptocurrency below its 50-day moving average.  At press time, bitcoin is trading at $4,325; up 1.46 percent as per data from CoinMarketCap. The two-day sell-off ran out of steam earlier today at the low of $4,150. The subsequent rebound then gathered pace above the 50-day moving average of $4,187.  However, the rebound from the 50-day moving average support seen in the one hour indicates the fears over the event are overblown. So, is bitcoin set to fly high or is the rally a bull trap?  The price action analysis suggests the cryptocurrency is currently hovering in the no man's land.  Daily chart  A solid rally from the 50-day moving average support, though encouraging, is not enough. BTC needs to take the rising trend line, in which case the odds of a rally to $4,700 levels would improve significantly.  4-hour chart  Golden crossover  was confirmed on Tuesday. Today's rally from the low of $4,150 to $4,325 adds credence to the argument that moving average crossovers tend to work after a time lag.  Bearish Scenario - Potential Head and Shoulders  But while there's reason for optimism, bitcoin is not out of the woods yet. Investors need to watch out for a failure at the resistance offered by the rising trend line as it could lead to a head and shoulders pattern.  Head and shoulders formation consists of a left shoulder, a head, and a right shoulder and a line drawn as the neckline. A break below the neckline indicates a bearish trend reversal.  View  An end of the day close above the rising trend line would open doors for a rally to $4,700  Meanwhile, a failure to take the rising trend line followed by a break below the head and shoulders neckline support of $4,170 would open up downside towards $3,870.

Air France, according to Aviation Today, recently discussed the possibility in a webinar alongside Microsoft and Ramco Aviation, a company that develops software for maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) systems that airlines use to service their aircraft.  During the session, James Kornberg, innovation director for Air France KLM's business unit, said that supply chain applications in particular are especially attractive to the airliner.  ""The use case has to be realistic. The four features of blockchain are resilience, traceability, integrity and disintermediation [and] are well suited to the aviation supply chain,"" he said.  The question of whether Air France will start switching to wholly blockchain-based systems remains an open one, though.  As quoted by Aviation Today, Kornberg said that a major obstacle is that much of airline data isn't actually kept digitally. Until paper-based processes are modernized, blockchain wouldn't be as helpful as envisioned.  ""In the aviation industry, we still have a lot of our data that is not digitalized, still a lot of analog data, the first step, and that's what we're doing at the moment – going to a fully digital solution, on all the supply chain and all the aviation data that we get,"" explained Kornberg.

42427844,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4KXh,1507204871,Fight for Your Right: Universal Music Veteran Launches Ethereum IP Platform,"Andres Martin-Lopez is obsessed with music.  As a child, the former senior project manager for global music corporation Universal Music Group, thought it was fun to organize and reorganize his CDs by genre, artist or whatever other classification he could imagine. Now, he's merging that passion with blockchain technology, recently raising $1.2 million for Blokur, a music-rights management firm that uses the ethereum blockchain.  It's another instance of a legacy industry executive moving into the wild world of blockchain in an effort to disintermediate the middlemen that currently extract value from the little guy. Blokur's mission is to ensure musicians get paid proportionately to the shares of the song they own, and the best way to do that, according to Martin-Lopez is to record music rights on a blockchain.  In his first interview since co-founding the London-based startup earlier this year, Martin-Lopez said:  ""For each work, we're creating a more precise and complete rights picture around it, which means it's easier to license content for that piece of work, because it's more accurate.""  Already, Blokur works with 3,000 music publishers and 10,000 songwriters, and its five-person team has already collaborated with the likes of Radiohead, will.i.am and Imogen Heap.  The seed round of funding – raised by Digital Currency Group, Ascension Ventures, media entrepreneur Remy Minute and InnovateUK, a British innovation agency – will help the startup double the size of its team, while scaling the number of clients it helps move data.  Harmonizing the data  The first step to making sure musicians and publishers are paid out appropriately is reconciling information, so that a consistent set of data can be added to the ethereum blockchain.  According to Martin-Lopez:  ""Reconciling all these different data sources, we're using smart algorithms to resolve inconsistencies in the data automatically, and we're capturing the data and writing a state on the blockchain for each individual's music rights.""  If that sounds complex, that's because it is. Every record company, publisher, musician, music rights non-profit has its own internal record of the people, bands, song titles and purchases. But many times those records can be wrong, with misspelled names or incorrect spacing or erroneous capitalization in band names – all discrepancies that can lead to right holders not getting paid.  Blokur is using machine learning software to help the company catch these mistakes, and then fixing them on a new aggregated list that can be added to the blockchain. According to Martin-Lopez, that system makes music rights management as much as 70 percent more efficient.  In addition to removing inconsistencies, Blokur also tracks the percentage stake each right holder has in a specific piece of music, paying them out directly with cryptocurrency.  And that process, Martin-Lopez estimates, earns each counterparty 4.4 percent more income on average.  Growing the platform  With music and other arts in the U.S. alone contributing $704 billionhttps://www.arts.gov/news/2016/arts-and-cultural-production-contributed-7042-billion-us-economy-2013 to the economy in 2016, the space has piqued the interest of plenty of blockchain entrepreneurs, which will mean strong competition for Blokur.  And even with its experienced team, others in the market have founders and advisers with equally strong backgrounds. For instance, Imogen Heap is developing a blockchain-based platform for music called Ujo, and Slovenia-based Viberate has snagged two high-profile advisers: bitcoin entrepreneur Charlie Shrem and Pinterest chief scientist Dr. Jure Leskovec.  However, Blokur contends it will launch a commercial product soon, after releasing its first product for helping music publishers manage composition rights in beta earlier this year.  Currently, the company is engaged in negotiations ""with several large publishers, performing rights societies and artists,"" and has been collecting data from early adopters on how to improve the platform.  Plus, the company has aspirations to expand into artist's rights more generally, once they prove the solution within the music industry.  Martin-Lopez concluded:  ""We understand the problem that needs to be solved, and we're using these participants to try to help us solve that problem.""  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Blokur.

A joint effort between R3, Payments Canada, the Bank of Canada and others, Project Jasper is a distributed ledger technology (DLT) research project that seeks to simulate a wholesale payment system using a DLT-based settlement asset called CADcoin or settlement coin.  The project, which has been under development since March of last year, was set up to see if DLT could meet international standards for banking payments infrastructure, and this is the first time a formal white paper has been produced summarizing the work.  The paper details the mechanics of various experiments undertaken so far, with both ethereum and R3's distributed ledger protocol Corda having been trialed.  Ethereum's proof-of-work consensus was found to be too risky for banking systems and, while the alternate consensus model used by Corda was an improvement on this, it apparently also failed to meet the necessary ""operational risk requirements.""  However, the authors say that while there is ""much analysis"" still to be completed, Project Jasper could prove to be the ""core"" for settlement systems based on DLT in future.  The paper states:  ""It is also possible that a cash-based settlement-solution system such as Jasper could prove to be the core upon which other distributed ledger platforms can be built to perform tasks such as settlement of financial asset transactions, manage syndicated loans and support trade finance.""  In conclusion, if such a system for payment and settlement could be realized, ""there could be significant benefits for the whole financial sector and the economy overall,"" it says.

In a mailing list update this week, Igno Peverell, the pseudonymous lead of the MimbleWimble project, stated the developer team is exploring how it could program in consistent changes as a buffer against faulty code. The statements come amidst a larger debate on how public blockchain networks should pursue updates, given this process can have disruptive complications.  Possible issues aside, though, Peverall believes these upgrades could ""clean up"" the nascent blockchain and allow for the correction of any flaws.  Peverell writes:  ""As we're preparing both a fully new blockchain format and implementation we, developers, are bound to make mistakes. Some of them will be trivial to correct, and some of them will not, requiring changes in consensus parameters.""  Peverell suggests that every six months, MimbleWimble will ""hard fork"" or swap to a new blockchain, a schedule that could occur for the first two years of the project.  In response, contributor Casey Rodarmor agreed to the proposal, and using project-specific atmospherics, suggested the upgrades could align with the summer and winter solstices. ""The betas would then be available on the equinox prior,"" Rodarmor suggested.  Infused with Harry Potter references from the start (the term ""MimbleWimble"" comes from a spell detailed in the popular book series), the project, which aims to roll out a network in the coming months, has been heralded as a solution to privacy and scalability issues facing blockchains.  Another mailing list contributor, Andrew Bellenie, suggested not to limit the hard forks to the first two-year period, but rather, to schedule them as ongoing upgrades in a way that mimics monero's current strategy. Still, there are signs other factors could come into play in any decision making.  He added: ""I like the solstice idea too, for entirely non-technical reasons.""

Notably, for more novice investors, the fund will seek to invest in the broader cryptocurrency asset class, beyond better-known options such as bitcoin.  Toward that end, the fund will include allocations of 15 cryptocurrencies that will change based on Mougayar's outlook on the cryptocurrency space. Currently, Mougayar will hold the largest allocation, at 20 percent of the total index, in ether, and 10 percent in bitcoin.  Three lesser-known cryptocurrencies – steem, nexium and cofoundit – will each represent 10 percent of the index's holdings. The remaining 10 cryptocurrencies, which include melon, augur and basic attention token, will each represent 4 percent of the holdings.  ""Having a basket of cryptocurrencies, managed by someone who knows what they are doing, in a way removes some of the risks for the average consumer,"" Mougayar said.  Fund costs and structure  But while new crypto index funds are launching almost daily, Mougayar's fund seems to be courting a new class of retail investor – those with more experience in cryptocurrency than in traditional markets.  Mougayar's index charges a relatively low total fee of 5 percent, which is in stark contrast to the very high ""two-and-twenty"" fee structure fiat-based hedge funds sometimes charge.  Managers of those funds will typically argue that their research work, and sometimes active trading, drive up costs – and that their returns justify their fees, though that assertion is a highly controversial one. Mougayar told CoinDesk that he charges a premium over the 2 percent sometimes charged by low-fee passive funds because he believes active management can provide investors with substantial additional value creation.  Also, unlike other cryptocurrency hedge funds, Mougayar's does not require a minimum investment, something that should appeal to smaller retail investors.  ""It's like you're on an exchange. You can buy 0.1 bitcoin. There is no minimum,"" he said.  Diving deeper, Mougayar's partnership with Iconomi divides two responsibilities typically consolidated in a single firm in other lower-fee tracking funds.  In order to invest in Mougayar's fund, users must first load their account by depositing bitcoin or ether on the Iconomi platform. While Mougayar selects the initial portfolio allocations and re-weights regularly, the investor's user account will reside on the Iconomi blockchain platform.  An additional advantage of partnering with Iconomi, Mougayar argued, is that investors do not need to manage the custody of their own key pairs.
