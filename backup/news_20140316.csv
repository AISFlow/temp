42376986,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vwnp,1395012817,Indonesia to Add Full Bitcoin Exchange as Merchant Network Grows,"The bitcoin economy in Indonesia has been growing lately, with its premier bitcoin buying and selling service Bitcoin Indonesia now operating a full open exchange, trading around 30 BTC per day.  While still not at the level of other larger countries, it's certainly an improvement on the 5 BTC per day the exchange reported at its launch back in December 2013.  At that stage, CEO and active local digital currency advocate Oscar Darmawan said he aimed for the company to become a full-fledged open exchange, but that volumes would need to improve first.  It seems that has happened within just a couple of months, as interest in bitcoin and digital currency grows rapidly throughout Indonesia's and Southeast Asia's young and upwardly mobile population.  Bitcoin Indonesia  Bitcoin Indonesia is now running as an open exchange for all interested in entering the bitcoin ecosystem.  Said Darmawan:    ""We are launching our system and we are confident that our daily volume at least will reach 200 BTC daily in this semester.      So far, about 1,500 members already listed in our database and everything running better than expectation.""    The exchange's current price is 7,150,000 rupiah, or about $629.5, close to the current CoinDesk BPI price of $626.  Darmawan has also met with local regulatory authorites to discuss bitcoin and appeared on network TV in Jakarta. He says he intends to launch more services in the coming year.  That will hopefully include a partnership with another bitcoin business to import the country's first bitcoin vending machine (or ATM), though the project was still in its early stages.  Local merchants  As in other places, finding local merchants willing to accept bitcoin is proving more of a challenge than finding entrepreneurs launching bitcoin services. But even there, there has been some progress.  A popular restaurant cafe called Upstairs on Cikini (street) near Jakarta's central business district has begun accepting bitcoin for all payments.  Upstairs uses a payment processing system developed by Bitwyre, another local bitcoin multi-services company.  Co-founder Dendi Suhubdy said Bitwyre was also developing a spot and derivatives trading system and would be signing up more local businesses soon.  The company's blog said: ""We will definitely expand to more business in Jakarta: Bakoel Coffee, Potato Head Garage Jakarta and Bali, Ku De Ta Bali, and all resto’s in Gili Trawangan.""  Indonesia is the world's fourth most populous country and a member of the G20 group of largest economies. It is usually considered one of the world's 'emerging' economies and its capital, Jakarta, has seen a boom in business and construction activity in recent years.

42376971,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vwYj,1394987663,OKCoin Raises $10 Million to Become China's 'Largest Exchange',"OKCoin, the exchange claiming to be China's largest by trading volume, has announced a $10m Series A funding round.  The investment round was led by Ceyuan, one of China's earliest venture capital firms, followed by Mandra Capital, VenturesLab and numerous high-profile angel investors.  Despite the nation's recent crackdown on cryptocurrencies, it seems Chinese venture capitalists are still bullish on bitcoin exchanges and the currency itself.  Bitcoin in China  Back in November 2013, the focus of the bitcoin community was on China – the world's hub for bitcoin trading. At that time, BTC China was the biggest exchange in the world, having managed to raise a $5m Series A funding round from Lightspeed Venture Partners (Snapchat, Nest). There were even rumours that a bigger round was in the works for the young company.  However, things change quickly. After the Chinese government began regulating bitcoin in December, trade volume plummeted and the world's top exchange was no longer Chinese.  Local exchanges came up with creative solutions for customers to continue to buy and sell bitcoin, and players like Huobi and OKCoin claimed to pass BTC China in their daily trade volume, although these figures have been the subject of much dispute.  OKCoin has grown rapidly over the past few weeks and is now the biggest Chinese exchange, according to its CEO Star Xu. He claims the exchange's current daily trade volume is approximately 50,000 bitcoins per day.  Interestingly, on top of that, the exchange allegedly trades 5 million litecoins per day. The company claims that at its peak it reached over 300,000 bitcoin and 13 million litecoin trades.  Future growth  Mr Feng Bo, founder and partner at Ceyuan, commented that he has a tremendous amount of confidence in the future of bitcoin and the continued growth of OKCoin:  ""We are delighted to invest in the pioneer of China’s bitcoin exchanges; given the company’s leadership under Star Xu and his team, we know there is much more good news ahead.""  Ceyuan is a well-known fund with investments in successful Chinese companies like Qihoo 360 (NASDAQ: QIHU), Light in the Box (NASDAQ: LITB), UC Web and VANCL – among others.  Interestingly, Silicon Valley investor Tim Draper was involved in the round, as a partner of VenturesLab. He and his son Adam remain active in bitcoin-related investments, mainly via Adam's Boost.vc incubator where Tim is a mentor. Tim also invested in OKCoin's angel round.  OKCoin overseas  The investment in OKCoin will be used to expand the team, fund product research and development, further security enhancements, but also to expand OKCoin's operations beyond China.  This a different strategy from the other Chinese exchanges and it may prove to be a smart move, given the current regulations in the state.  Mark Mai, VentureLab's China partner, stated that as the regulatory environment in regions such as Singapore, the US and Hong Kong becomes clearer, it will open up opportunities for OKCoin to operate in geographies where it can offer maximized safety and protection for OKCoin clients.  Mai said that the growth of virtual currency is inevitable, and that many countries are coming to terms with the fact that they have to regulate these currencies, because their citizens are using them regardless.  He added that OKCoin welcomes oversight because he believes it will help the company to serve its customers better, allowing them to open up regulated bank and trading accounts so it can engage in third-party clearance and settlement.  All eyes will be on OKCoin's global expansion in these uncertain times. Will the exchange make it as a large player outside China? Only time will tell.

42376973,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vwcV,1394981036,Japanese Megabank Mizuho Now an Official Defendant in Mt. Gox Lawsuits,"Mizuho, one of Japan's three largest banks and the banking partner of now-bankrupt bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, has been named as a defendant in two class action lawsuits stemming from the exchange's insolvency.  Reuters reported that the megabank was named as a defendant in the existing US lawsuit in which Mt. Gox is accused of defrauding customers, and a Canadian class action lawsuit blaming Gox for a security breach that allowed hackers to steal an alarming 800,000+ bitcoins.  It is still not known for sure what happened to Mt. Gox's bitcoins, whether they have been lost, stolen or remain ""temporarily unavailable"".  Speculation continued over the weekend as observers noted the exchange's API was still being used to move bitcoins around, sometimes in very similar amounts.  The amended US suit also added Mark Karpeles' second-in-command Gonzague Gay-Bouchery and Mt. Gox's original founder and shareholder Jed McCaleb as defendants.  Providing services  In both legal cases, it was Mizuho's position as Mt. Gox's banker that prompted the actions. The bank held large amounts of fiat currency for the exchange and its customers, and the US complaint made by Illinois resident Gregory Greene said ""Mizuho profited from the fraud"" by doing so.  The suit says Mizuho should have segregated Mt. Gox's funds from those of the exchange's customers, and that by continuing to provide banking services it actually inflated consumer losses.  A leaked recording, released to the Internet, reportedly shows a Mizuho manager asking Karpeles to close Gox's account with the bank due to compliance and other concerns. Despite the manager warning the bank would close the account forcibly if necessary, Karpeles did not cooperate.  Problems for other bitcoin businesses  Holding banks so liable could cause companies in other countries to become even more reluctant to become involved with bitcoin businesses, something that's presented a problem for startups over the past year or so.  Some, including ordinary customers, have found their business denied and others their accounts shut down without much explanation, apparently for being involved with bitcoin-related business.  Despite CEO Karpeles' Japanese language press conference, public apology and the company's Japanese legal statements posted since to its website, 99% of Mt. Gox's customers are not Japanese and those involved in lawsuits overseas could see Mizuho as a potentially lucrative avenue for reimbursement.  Bankruptcy proceedings in the US are preventing further action against Mt. Gox in Japan, but do not protect Japanese parent company Tibanne, its CEO Karpeles or its Gox's US-based subsidiary Mt. Gox, Inc.

42376988,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vwu7,1394974156,"The CoinDesk Mining Roundup: Zoomhash, Cloud Hashing and Riggit V9 Mining Frame","As difficulty and hash rates continue to rise, cryptocurrency mining offers the promise of spoils for those who persevere.  Case in point is the story of Dave Carlson, who went from 30 GPU rigs to an advanced mining operation capable of making millions.  It seems decentralized, math-based currencies are on the up, and increasing amounts of miners are hashing away, powering these globe-spanning payment networks.  With this in mind, here’s a look at the top mining stories that have surfaced since our last round-up.  TREZOR public demo of wallet hardware  Wallet hardware designer TREZOR exhibited a public demo of its product this month at the Bitcoin Exchange Berlin (BXB), a free event in the city that aims to educate the public about the currency.  The company began taking preorders for the wallet last summer with the aim to start shipping the devices in January. However, TREZOR has stated that it is still working out software bugs and refining case production.  Cloud Hashing's $20m monthly mining operation  Cloud Hashing  , which offers bitcoin-mining-as-a-service, is preparing to increase the amount of hashing power it provides. By the end of this month, the company expects to reach 2.5 PH/s per second.  David Gilbert of the International Business Times estimated that would equate to $20m in block rewards per month, although those numbers could quickly decline if bitcoin's difficulty continues its upward march.  The company is also rolling out a promotion for Mt. Gox victims via the Mt. Gox customer relief effort which offers prospective Cloud Hashing customers discounts on mining packages.  The rates stand at $8 per gigahash for customers who can verify they had an account with Mt. Gox by showing email correspondence or other documentation.  Mining Asics Technologies starts pre-orders  Netherlands-based Mining Asics Technologies B.V. has opened up preorders for its line of Scrypt-based miners. The company is taking 35% deposits for a lineup that includes both FPGA and ASIC Scrypt miners.  At the bottom end of the spectrum is the 10 MH/s 180W Platinum 1 FPGA Scrypt miner which costs €2,999. For the more sophisticated crowd, there is the top-end 200 MH/s 3KW Excalibur 3 ASIC Scrypt Miner for €14,999.  Mining Asics Technologies sells these as completely standalone mining units: there's no need for a host as the miners come with Linux preinstalled. Additionally, a web interface allows users to access the system, and the company says that it will provide support for CGMiner.  A market for bitcoin gigahashes  CEX.io  , the company associated with the GHash.io mining pool, offers users a marketplace for the supply and demand of gigahashes.  The company is offering an interesting idea: it takes gigahashes and uses it as a trading pair against bitcoin in the form of GHS/BTC. The exchange is leveraging the power of its pool to allow for trading of bitcoin for gigahashes of power.  CEX.io is also selling futures contracts so that miners can hedge against risk. It is currently selling contracts for both April and May.  Crypto Think Tank Riggit V9 mining frame  Scrypt mining is fast becoming a pursuit that requires careful planning. Thus, building rigs on a custom frame has become a popular choice for miners.  The Riggit V9 mining frame from Crypto Think Tank is a project design that provides spacing and power accommodation, but leaves the framing open to customization.  The Riggit V9's aluminum body can support up to eight cards, weighs 0.5 kilograms and is constructed for optimum airflow. It's designed to work best with two power supply units and has various screw placements for different configurations. The frame is available for $99.99 in Canadian dollars from NCIX.  AMD lowers Radeon R9 280 prices  GPU altcoin mining is really the only option left for the everyday mining enthusiast with limited means.  The good news is that AMD seemingly has solved some previous supply problems. It's selling Radeon R9 280 GPUs around a $279 price point, which is much lower than previous prices, which seem artificially inflated due to high demand.  Hashes per dollar spent are pretty important numbers right now, so the 270x might be a better deal electricity-wise.  MyRigSpace offering cheap electricity for North American hosting            On the subject of power consumption ... electricity usage is always on the mind of the cryptocurrency miner. The lower the electric cost, the better the mining yield.  MyRigSpace  , a new company located in Oregon, is focusing on that region's cheap hydro-generated electricity to market its hosting. ""The days of hobbyist mining may be coming to a close,"" said Robert Van Kirk of MyRigSpace.  The company is taking advantage of the Portland, OR area electricity prices that are around 7 cents per kilowatt-hour.  They are also exploring plans to leverage even cheaper hosting options in Moses Lake, Washington, where prices are 1.73 cents per kilowatt-hour.  Zoomhash selling Gridseed bitcoin and litecoin miners  Los Angeles-area Zoomhash may be selling a scrypt GPU mining killer. They have a uniquely designed mining unit that is capable of hashing scrypt at 300 ~ 400 KH/s at 7W, according to its website.  It is selling Gridseed units in packs. For example, a set of 10 Gridseed miners can be had for $ 2,399.00, which would produce 3,000 ~ 4,000 KH/s of power.  The company claims that the units can also hash bitcoin, even given the current difficulty. But attempts to contact the company's CEO to verify this have not been successful. Nevertheless, what Gridseed is offering has value over traditional scrypt GPUs.

42376987,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vwrb,1394971545,"Seeing Through Regulation, Banking on Bitcoin, and a Sheer Art Attack","Welcome to the CoinDesk Weekly Review 16th March 2014 – a regular look at the hottest, most thought-provoking and most controversial events in the world of digital currency through the eyes of scepticism and wonder.      Your host … John Law.    Regulation issues    Mysteries in bitcoinland don’t stay mysteries for long.      Take the world record transaction, which was noted in the block chain last November, when nearly 200,000 bitcoins hit a single wallet. Who was behind it? Turns out it was Bitstamp, which has just released details of an audit that confirms the transaction.      Why publish an audit when you don’t have to? It’s time for more transparency, says Bitstamp, and an industry that takes responsibility for itself.      Meanwhile, the extent of the transparency inherent in the system is becoming clearer. At the first academic conference dedicated to cryptocurrency analysis – held in Bermuda, unlike every academic conference John Law has been to – a fascinating paper was published that attempted to show how much digital dosh the Dread Pirate Roberts had garnered during his stint at the helm of Silk Road (squillions) and how many the FBI seized (about a fifth of that). Which is a fairly detailed audit of the affairs of an outfit running in total secrecy – Silk Road, silly, not the FBI.      John Law is not on the libertarian arm of the bitcoin booster brigade, and thinks that decent regulation worldwide will be essential to help the cybercurrency reach its potential to really shake things up.      Like cash, this won’t preclude unregulated activity, but while the Wild West is all very well in the movies it’s not a patch on living in the actual 21st century. But, as Google’s director of ideas Jared Cohen pointed out this week, while regulation’s been talked about for years there’s a real lack of new ideas.      More transparency is certainly one way to build confidence in the bitcoin ecosystem. But as the protocol is inherently transparent, regulation could largely consist of mandating access methods to information that identified company transactions.      If you want to have the protection of the regulator, then sign up to its disclosure regulations. Bitcoin, being a brand-new industry and one with everything to prove, is at a phase where the players should eagerly accept this.    It’s paradoxical but true that openness is often more secure than secrecy. If you don’t rely on people not finding things out, you’ve got nothing to lose if they do.  By adopting a radical approach to regulation based on what may seem an unhealthy degree of disclosure about their systems and activities, bitcoin companies could well end up more trustworthy than existing financial institutions – after all, how well has all that traditional corporate secrecy worked of late, and for whose benefit?  John Law has long been a fan of compulsory systems audits for companies, where their software gets a thorough going-over by independent analysts; not a problem for companies starting with that in mind, but how many banks would pass?  Regulators and industry members alike should recognise there’s a one-off chance here to create a truly innovative and effective environment, suited to the realities of the digital millennium. It could drag the rest of the financial industry along with it.  Taking it personally    The aftershocks of the failure of Mt. Gox continue to exercise the commentators, but the real world has moved on. In particular, the continuing problems in Ukraine, where the Russians seem to have forgotten that invading neighbouring countries stopped ending well some time ago, have led to a run on the banks in Crimea. The banks have responded by putting limits in cash withdrawals, which has increased customer confidence about as much as you’d expect.      “Wouldn’t happen with bitcoin,” one tweeter suggested. That’s true enough: in fact, would you even need a bank account?      The personal current account – PCA, in banking parlance – is a cornerstone of retail banking, In the UK, banks make about 30% of their revenue from PCAs more than from credit cards and savings combined, but in a 2008 report, the Office of Fair Trading noted that the PCA market wasn’t being run in the consumers’ best interest. Not much has changed since.      Charges and fees weren’t transparent, and customers had little idea how their accounts actually worked. Without that sort of knowledge, nobody was changing accounts, and thus with no competition the banks were and are free to do what they liked. Which, mostly, is help themselves. According to the OFT, banks made around £160 a year per current account – a nice trick with other people’s money.    Which is money you rarely actually see. Come payday, your employer asks the bank which has all of its money to send some of it to the bank that has all yours. Much the same sort of thing happens when you pay a bill. Unless you go to a cashpoint and withdraw a fistful of twenties, the banks have all the money all the time.  Bitcoin wallets could change that. The reason PCAs are such a good idea is that they’re gateways to all sorts of financial services such as bill paying, mortgages, insurance, credit cards and so on. Without a bank account, it’s very difficult to get at these. But – in that fabulous fantasy future where bitcoin is as ubiquitous as the Internet – bitcoin and software can do all that just as securely and reliably as a PCA.  Like real wallets, you can’t run a bitcoin wallet in overdraft. And it won’t pay you interest when you’re in credit, but then, overdrafts are terrible forms of credit and you won’t get much by way of interest from your PCA. So, why go to a bank for your daily financials?  In fact, there’s a more interesting question: why doesn’t the bank come to you? PCAs provide the banking system with a huge cash float that is an intimate part of its capitalisation, which is why you can’t get your cash out quickly from a Crimean cashpoint at the moment. But if bitcoin triggers a much slower but harder to control run on the banks, it need not be a disaster for them, yet it could be very good for us.  Your current account is worth £160 a year to them. Very well, let them pay for the privilege. They can run your bitcoin wallet for you, letting it count towards their liquidity much as PCAs do now, but on the understanding that you can click your fingers and get it back whenever you like – with all the direct debits, etc, intact.  That would put competition back into the system, much as number portability has kept the mobile phone companies … well, honest is clearly the wrong word, so let’s say nervous. Banks could offer services such as credit, or even actual cash, but would have to be a lot more transparent about how it all works. They might not like that, but it would make them better companies to deal with.    It would also finally put the old anecdote to bed – the letter from a bank manager to a perennially overdrawn customer that starts: “Dear Sir. It may have escaped your attention that the nature of our relationship is that you bank with us, not vice-versa.”    Art for art’s sake, bitcoin for God’s sake    It’s not just academics who are getting it together on bitcoin – the first art exhibition on a bitcoin theme took place this week in San Francisco. The pieces were, as so often at such events, good solid contemporary stuff that manage a degree of wit, but doesn't tent the boxers. John Law, who has been known to wave his walking-stick in disgust at modern artists for not being nearly adventurous enough, has some suggestions for future projects.      1. The Angels Of The West: A pair of statues, some 500 metres tall, of the Winklevoss Twins, in a heroic Soviet style, one pointing to the sky, the other gazing firmly upwards with hands on hips. Entirely hollow and coated in iron pyrites, this work will symbolise the power of bitcoin to create image unrelated to actual gravity. The inside can be divided into floors and used for affordable housing in the Bay Area, while the twins’ substantial self-esteem should provide funding for the construction.      2. Satoshis I - CXI: A room filled with a large bush, in which are hidden 111 teddy bears. Each of them has a tiny name badge pinned to their furry chests saying: “Hi! I’m Satoshi”. None of them invented bitcoin.      3. The Miner Lisa: A mysterious smile adorns the face of this chunky little robot, which seeks out the nearest power socket, plugs in and then just sits there. Over the next few weeks, the smile is slowly replaced by a frown, as of one straining at stool, while the robot gets hotter and hotter. Very occasionally, a bright copper ha’penny rolls down its trouser leg.      4. Fleur De Lie: A painting of Rene Magritte holding a tulip. Under it, in pink Comic Sans, is the phrase: “This is not a tulip.” The painting has a Raspberry Pi embedded in it, connected to the Internet via 3G and with its own bitcoin wallet and GPS receiver. If the painting isn’t constantly moved between cities and the bitcoin wallet increased in value, the Raspberry Pi ignites a set of explosives in the picture frame. Don’t get left holding the baby when the music stops!      Move over Banksy, Clear your schedule, Turner Prize committee. This isn’t just good art, it’s the Law.

42376982,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vwlJ,1394968028,Why Regulation Could Help Bitcoin,"A couple of weeks ago, we published a piece called 'Why Regulating Bitcoin Won't Work’. Here Bob Swarup provides the counter argument, assessing what regulations could do for bitcoin. Bob has extensive global experience in financial markets, macroeconomics and regulation. He has also recently released his new book Money Mania: Booms, Panics, and Busts from Ancient Rome to the Great Meltdown.  Is it a commodity? Is it a currency? No, it’s bitcoin.  There is a touch of Messianic fervour about virtual currencies these days, most notably bitcoin.  Newsweek relaunched its print edition on 6th March, with an exclusive scoop on the unmasking of one Satoshi Nakamoto, the founder of bitcoin, sparking a Keystone Cops farcical chase of reporters rushing to question him.  A fortnight earlier, the Winklevoss twins (of Facebook fame) launched the Winkdex to track the price of bitcoin and talked of the market being as large as $400bn – some 50 times larger than the current valuation.  Meanwhile, countless firms now talk of taking bitcoins as payment, including Richard Branson for anyone wanting to hitch a spaceflight on Virgin Galactic; Bitcoin ATMs have mushroomed since the first launched in Vancouver, Canada, in November 2013; and an army of bitcoin miners are recreating the digital equivalent of the California Gold Rush.  Bitcoin supporters are everywhere right now, if a tad more defensive in the wake of Mt. Gox. They invoke – in sentiment at least – the arguments of the noted Austrian economist, Friedrich Hayek, who advocated a free market of competing denationalised currencies. Provide people with choice, Hayek held, and they would instinctively choose those currencies that retained their value best and were least subject to the whims of errant policymakers.  Certainly, in an era where trust in the traditional monetary system has been shaken, bitcoin’s limited supply and freedom from human interference are powerful assets. They have transformed what was an interesting intellectual experiment into a living economy. Today, over 100 virtual currencies – bitcoin, Ripple, Unobtanium, HoboNickels, iCoin and their tribe – are fighting it out in a market $10bn large and growing.  But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. None of this is enough to create a sustainable pervasive currency. The reason is simple: currencies that thrive do so because they are endorsed and, thereby, legitimised by the state.  Money and state  Money is a social construct. History shows us anything – wooden sticks, huge stones, coins, gold, boxes of detergent and now, bits of enigmatic computer code – can function as money.  Any meaning we attach is imparted through the polyglot of social interactions – status, social conformity and human behaviour – that money encodes. Without the trust born of these, no medium of exchange can exist. Even when two nations trade, the money exchanged needs to be credible and convertible, which is why they often use a reserve currency, such as the US dollar.  [post-quote]  But for a currency to become widespread, lots of people need to accept it. That implies the presence of society and the overarching institutions it creates. In other words, it presupposes the existence of a dominant state that can influence the behaviour of individuals. The currencies that succeed, therefore, are not those that circumvent the state, but rather those that are legitimised by the state.  Once the state accepts said trinkets – digital or otherwise – and starts to regulate them, you also drive individuals to find new ways of acquiring this new medium. They now work for others, trade goods or services, and importantly, begin to use this new medium as a pervasive social hierarchy begins to emerge.  History demonstrates this time and time again. Most notably, in 1100, Henry I of England issued an edict that going forward, taxes could only be paid using tallies – humble wooden sticks. He also prescribed their form – rudimentary medieval regulation – stating that each tally was to be cleaved in half between debtor and creditor, with the sum of money represented by an abacus of carefully delineated notches.  The results were dramatic. Growing confidence created a natural demand. The need to acquire the sticks for taxes meant that transactions began to be done using them. For the next seven centuries, wood passed as proxy for money and the English even evolved a sophisticated system of government financing based around tallies.  The upside of regulation  Done intelligently, regulation can solve key problems that bitcoin is now facing in its efforts to become a proper currency.  First, regulation can create demand for bitcoins. By making them a means of paying taxes or closing major financial transactions, it provides legitimacy to the currency. That naturally diffuses knowledge, familiarity and demand for bitcoins across a wider swathe of people, breeding acceptance. This is essential. The majority of Americans today – 80% according to a recent poll by TheStreet.com – still have no idea what bitcoin is.  This increased demand in turn can help manage the volatile swings that typify bitcoin today. The currency’s volatility may be loved by speculators looking to claw profits, but businesses still file tax returns and accounts in dollars, euros and other mainstream currencies.  The need to convert back from bitcoins to these and maintain consistent margins means many will prioritise earnings stability over continual monitoring of fluctuating bitcoin prices. But as more people embrace bitcoin, the marketplace gains more liquidity, naturally dampening volatility and making bitcoin transactions more than a marketing gimmick.  Second, the rationale for regulation is always simple: markets may fail and cause ﬁnancial crisis. This is not surprising – what we term financial markets are little more than a collective noun for the hopes, greed and fears of countless individuals jostling with each other in the continual pursuit of wealth (and status).  The widespread use of any currency, including bitcoin, is predicated on the assurance that it is ‘safe’. Thus, currencies are dependent on the qualitative metric of conﬁdence for their long-term survival.  Bitcoin – more than most other currencies – runs the risk of ‘bank runs’. The limited quantum – a maximum of 21 million – is problematic for the needs of a wider economy that is structurally dependent on borrowing. If bitcoins gain wider acceptance, simple transactions involving exchange will soon give way to borrowing and lending in bitcoins.  This financialisation is an inevitable consequence of human innovation, as people seek to make money out of these contours of supply and demand. But given the limited number of bitcoins, there will inevitably also be bottlenecks as demand occasionally outstrips supply and people overextend themselves.  In the absence of externally imposed safeguards to instil social confidence, people are more likely to panic at the first whiff of trouble, creating a disorderly stampede that could irreparably harm bitcoin’s credibility in the eyes of consumers.  Regulation will not prevent future bitcoin crises, but it can help manage their impact and minimise the disruption caused. This is critical. As humans, we have strong aversions to loss and uncertainty. Regulation provides an emotional salve that soothes our tail risk. It creates an abstract implicit trust that the economic infrastructure we are using is sound, with better behaviour enforced by the threat of sanction. Good regulation also focuses on transparency – an important component of allowing us to judge risks and make reasoned decisions.  Given regulation and the sanction of the state, bitcoin has a chance of progressing past its adolescence. Otherwise, it remains just another interesting economic experiment, confined to niche corners of the digiverse, much like cigarettes in prison or trading cards in the playground.

42376972,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vwXT,1394964532,What the UK's Tax Reversal Means for Bitcoin,"The regular drumbeat of government warnings on bitcoin continues apace. Last month, Israel, Vietnam and Cyprus joined the chorus.  However, in addition to this din (not entirely unwarranted many would argue) one government body has begun to undo its earlier mistakes in the bitcoin space.  The body in question is the UK’s tax authority, HMRC, which this month effectively recognised bitcoin as a currency after months of lobbying by London’s bitcoin community, led by members of the soon-to-launch UK Digital Currency Association.  But will HMRC’s decision turn the UK into a leading centre for new financial services based around bitcoin or should those arguing for greater government engagement be careful what they wish for?  A sensible approach?  The positive arguments are obvious. HMRC has flip-flopped around the issue for months, first saying bitcoins were ‘taxable vouchers’ in November 2013, meaning that any purchase of bitcoin would require a VAT payment of 20% of the value of the bitcoin. This is the equivalent of paying €100 in tax if you wanted to buy €500 for your holiday in Spain.  Not long after, at the start of December 2013, they began to backtrack, beginning discussions with bitcoiners and indicating that they might reconsider their earlier position. At the time, Elliptic CEO Tom Robinson said:  “The general feeling I got from [our meeting with HMRC] was that they don’t think VAT should be levied on the bitcoin value itself.”  The fact that this was just weeks after HMRC decided the exact opposite indicates their rather haphazard approach to the role of cryptocurrencies.  Firing the starting gun  In their guidance issued on 3rd March, HMRC stepped back from explicitly recognising bitcoin as a currency, but their approach effectively treats it like any other form of payment for tax purposes:  ""In all instances, VAT will be due in the normal way from suppliers of any goods or services sold in exchange for Bitcoin or other similar cryptocurrency.""  For Richard Asquith, Head of Tax at the TMF Group, this creates a stable framework that will encourage bitcoin businesses to look at the UK as a base for their operations. Other countries are going to have to come to a decision about how to tax bitcoin, he says:  “It’s going to force tax authorities around Europe and particularly the US to make a decision about how to tax it. The UK has fired the starting gun.”  Few other countries have taken a similar approach. Germany previously classed bitcoin as “private money”, while Singapore has classed it as a good, rather than a currency, and Russia has gone as far as to say bitcoin transactions are illegal, although they have allegedly softened their stance somewhat.  “HMRC’s decision is quite forward thinking in terms of other countries,” says Asquith. “It gives it the proper recognition for how it’s used in day-to-day activities.”  How much is 20%?  But before everyone breaks out the champagne, it should be remembered that there’s a lot that the guidance doesn’t cover.  For one, HMRC deals with tax issues, so their advice doesn’t even touch on the question of how bitcoin businesses might be regulated, unlike the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), which recently announced they would begin regulating bitcoin exchanges.  Furthermore, the question of which exchange rate to use is still one that’s up for debate. HMRC merely says that merchants should use “sterling value of the cryptocurrency at the point the transaction takes place”, which is fine if you are using BitPay or Coinbase, merchant services that instantly convert bitcoin payments into fiat currency. However, if you are taking bitcoin from customers directly then you need to be careful, and consistent, about converting from bitcoin into sterling.  With the recent collapse of Mt. Gox and hacks of other exchanges, it would be dangerous for HMRC to pin their colours to any single bitcoin exchange, or even a group of exchanges says Richard Howlett, whose firm Selachii LLP is launching a lawsuit against Mt. Gox:  “If the government were to implicitly back an exchange, it could be disastrous. They’re not going to want people to think that 'this is a safe place to trade my bitcoin'.”  Conversely, for fiat currencies HMRC currently publishes exchange rate figures from the Financial Times. As measures of the price of bitcoin become more established (for example, the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index), this should become less of an issue.  For now, merchants should choose a popular exchange and ensure they’re not moving around to get the best rate.  “You have to take the fair market value,” says Richard Asquith. “HMRC insist that you use the most popular exchanges and you stick to it.”  Giving bitcoin legitimacy  In a blog post published in response to HMRC’s guidance, Elliptic CEO Tom Robinson, who has arguably driven the change in policy, praised the tax authority, writing that they had taken “a thoughtful and logical approach” to cryptocurrencies.  At the same time, there doesn't appear to be a consistent attitude towards bitcoin among the UK establishment. The Bank of England, for example, this week suggested that bitcoin is more like a commodity than a currency:  ""Digital currencies ... may have more conceptual similarities to commodities, such as gold, than money""  Aside from the practical implications, HMRC's decision gives bitcoin a significant reputation boost. It’s even taxed like a currency, supporters in the UK can now say. Howlett agrees: “[HMRC is] acknowledging that this is something that’s here to stay.”  But if further government regulation is to follow, as Robinson's post suggests, the next battle for bitcoin's supporters is ensuring that it's the ""right"" regulation. Indeed, getting bitcoiners to agree what regulation is welcome will likely be a challenge all in itself.
