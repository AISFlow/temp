42426256,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJLejh,1423518627,"$25,000 in Bitcoin Seized from Alleged Software Scam Operator","A cache of bitcoins and litecoins has been seized by federal law enforcement officials as part of an investigation into alleged counterfeit software sales and distribution.  Approximately 105 BTC and 900 LTC were cited in a civil forfeiture that included more than $7m, hundreds of gold and silver bars and coins, and a number of luxury items including sports cars, wedding rings and a diamond-encrusted Rolex.  The operation involved a number of companies based in Missouri, Nevada, Washington state and Maryland. The digital currency holdings were confiscated from Rex Yang, a Seattle-based business operator who allegedly sold $1.4m in stolen codes.  In a separate filing, US law enforcement officials placed a restraining order on a number of buildings in Seattle owned by or tied to Yang, as well as additional $2.2m in funds.  The filing reads:  ""The defendants bitcoin and litecoin, which are virtual currencies, were seized on December 10, 2014, at the residence of Yang in Seattle, Washington. As of January 22, 2015, the bitcoin had a value of $25,087.29 and the litecoin had a value of $1,269.87.""  The investigation into a group of individuals suspected of selling fraudulent software codes and digital media was filed on 30th January, according to court documents filed in the US District Court for the Western District of Missouri.        Digital currency tied to software scam  The court documents state that the bitcoins seized were purchased from Coinbase through a Wells Fargo bank account tied to a company owned by Yang and others involved with the alleged scheme called Technolutions.  Seized on 10th December, the digital currency holdings were linked, according to the filing, to the ""illegal sale of software"".  While the filing doesn't outline how the bitcoins and litecoins were used to facilitate the alleged scheme, purchases of both cryptocurrencies were debited to the Yang-owned Wells Fargo account 20 times between 10th December, 2013 and 30th September, 2014.  A Department of Justice spokesperson declined to comment on the seizure of Yang’s digital currency holdings, telling CoinDesk:  “Because this is a case that is at least indicated to the court that there is a potential criminal investigation ongoing as well, it’s really not appropriate for us to make any comment on the case at this time.”  Controversial practice  Civil forfeiture has become an increasingly controversial practice in the US because of its legal nature and the prevalence of ""policing for profit"", by which civil forfeiture is used as a funding mechanism for American police forces.  Critics of the policy say law enforcement officials are given too much discretion when conducting civil forfeitures. Efforts on the state and federal level are underway to reform the practice, though some question whether or not loopholes exist that give police forces leeway to seize assets during investigations.  The best-known case of the civil forfeiture of bitcoins dates to the confiscation of holdings from Ross Ulbricht and the now-defunct Silk Road marketplace, who earlier this month was found guilty of drug trafficking, money laundering and computer hacking charges.

42426264,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJLf1h,1423515775,Pantera Leads $1.1 Million Funding for African Bitcoin Startup BitPesa,"Kenya-based bitcoin services provider BitPesa has raised $1.1m as part of a new funding round led by hedge fund Pantera Capital.  Additional participants in the round included VC firms Bitcoin Opportunity Corp, Crypto Currency Partners, Future/Perfect Ventures and Stephens Investment Management.  BitPesa  CEO Elizabeth Rossiello explained that funding comes at a time when the nine-member team is still evolving its core services and seeking to identify the target consumers for whom the offering will be most appealing.  The service currently enables the exchange of bitcoin for Kenyan Shillings, and allows users in Kenya and Ghana to send fiat funds to popular mobile money wallets.  Rossiello told CoinDesk  “We’ve had our heads down building a solid product, and now we’re hiring to grow. A big part of that is expanding our team to help us grow in other markets where we see the demand.”  Investors see this big-picture vision as well, with Crypto Currency Partners managing partner W Bradford Stephens suggesting that BitPesa is part of a broader trend to position bitcoin as an enabler of financial inclusion.  “The blockchain doesn’t just enable financial services to four billion of the ‘unbanked’ in developing countries, it connects them to the globalized online economy,” Stephens said.  BitPesa plans to use the funding to expand its service to Tanzania and Uganda in the first quarter of 2015, and expects to launch a revamped website in the coming weeks.  The company officially launched in November 2013, entered beta in May 2014 and opened its alpha this past summer.  Facing challenges  The funding coincides on with the publication of a blog post that finds the company looking back on its first year-plus of operations and discussing its findings regarding how successful its bitcoin solution is proving in the African market.  Notably, Rossiello indicated that, as a service that aggregates payments from around the globe, BitPesa's success is influenced, and in some ways hindered, by the current size of the wider bitcoin network and availability of on-ramps to that ecosystem.  “We’ve seen a huge uptick where it’s easy and cheap to get bitcoin, and we’ve seen slower uptake where people don’t have that access. That’s the biggest finding over the year,” Rossiello said.  Rossiello suggested that bitcoin as a money sending tool is currently not competitive everywhere, and that BitPesa intends to focus on identifying markets where such an offering can compete.  As an example, she cited the UK as a problematic market that has required increased marketing investment due to the struggles the country’s bitcoin businesses have had securing bank accounts. When BitPesa launched, it was initially focused solely on the UK-Kenya remittance corridor.  Winning small businesses  While often framed as a bitcoin remittance service, Rossiello suggested that BitPesa is primarily used today by small business owners in the UK who have links to East Africa.  “Remittance is defined as a monthly subsidy from one family member to another in their home country,” Rossiello said. “The image in our head is one of subsidizing real income. We don’t necessarily see that as much.”  Rossiello said that consumers are using the service, however, but as a way to send larger amounts for non-essential purchases such as gifts and presents.  Still, she said the service is proving popular, a development she ties to the firm’s emphasis on customer service and building relationships with users.  “We have a really high retention rate, customers that were just doing bitcoin to shillings are now doing both way trades, so we really see people like the service that we offer,” Rossiello added.  BitPesa earns 3% off transfers from bitcoin to Kenyan Shillings, but does not charge transfer fees.  Encouraging international use  The news also comes during a broader shift in tone from the bitcoin industry, with a some of its more public figures seeking to highlight that bitcoin today is most competitive in developing markets.  Investors, the funding round suggests, may be increasingly keen to provide assistance to the startups exploring this vertical, with Bitcoin Opportunity Corp’s Barry Silbert citing both remittance and mobile money as “leading bitcoin use cases”.  “I’m very proud of the team and am thrilled to bring on the new investors to support BitPesa’s growth and expansion plans,” Silbert said.

42426273,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJLf5h,1423505742,Russia’s Interior Ministry Defers to Central Bank for Bitcoin Guidance,"The Ministry of the Interior of the Russian Federation (MVD) has issued new statements on bitcoin and its possible regulation under domestic law.  The agency tasked with implementing government policy and regulation suggested it would wait on a decision by the Bank of Russia, the country’s central bank, before taking any action on matters of policy.  Alexey Moshkov, chief of the agency’s special technical activities bureau, told Russia-based news agency TASS:  ""We rely on decisions of our regulator and will act in line with the legislative practice in this area.”  The remark is notable given that, in contrast to other government agencies, members of the Bank of Russia historically have been open to bitcoin as a technology, arguing for a wait-and-see approach to regulation that would also mitigate its use by criminals.  Moshkov went on to voice his belief that bitcoin and digital currencies are unregulated in the country, and that this presents a risk to users. Further, he noted that bitcoin and digital currency users currently do not have recourse should they suffer losses.  Head of Russia's division dedicated to cybercrime enforcement, Moshkov reports to internal affairs director Vladimir Kolokoltsov.  Regulation discussion evolves  While unable to directly influence the outcome of Russia’s policies toward bitcoin, the MVD nonetheless has hinted at how this conversation may evolve among federal agencies.  Russia’s Ministry of Finance, for example, has been perhaps the most vocal agency, issuing a proposal in August that would call for the ban of “monetary surrogates”, the wording of the definition suggesting that bitcoin and digital currencies would be captured under the law.  The agency later moved to introduced proposed fines for Russian citizens that issue or create digital currencies, or otherwise promote their use.  Though the measure isn't expected to be voted on until the spring of 2015, the legal environment for digital currency startups in Russia remains murky, with its communications body most recently blocking bitcoin websites.

42426263,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJLexh,1423491797,Markets Weekly: Slow Week for Bitcoin Price as 'Grexit' Looms,"The bitcoin price stayed relatively flat over the last week, trading around the $225 mark.  The digital currency opened on 2nd February at $226.40 and closed seven days later at $222.87, showing a loss of 1.56% over the period, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index.  Price movement appeared to be muted in the absence of major announcements or events.  The first days of the week showed the most action. On 2nd February, the price climbed $16 to hit a high of $242. This was followed by the week's biggest intra-day swing the following day, when the price plunged $22 from a high of $246.19. The day ended with bitcoin trading at $226.96.  Sentiment indicators  The market appears to be cautiously bullish about bitcoin's price prospects, according to sentiment indicatorshttp://bfxdata.com/sentiment/longshort.php on Bitfinex.  Hourly swaps activity had longs outpacing shorts for most of the week. Shorts dominated on 4th and 5th February, but gave way to longs for the remainder of the period.  Total active swaps showed a slight uptick for longs towards the end of the week, accounting for 78% of active swaps at the close of 8th February.  The week's swaps activity has been more positive than trends since the start of the year. Since January, long swaps have accounted for between 72% and 80% of all active swaps on Bitfinex. Contrast this to a peak last June when long swaps took up 90% of the swaps market.  Meanwhile, short swaps hit a peak of 27% on 8th January, but have since declined to around 20% of total active swaps.  On the regulatory front, the Italian central bank issued guidance saying that cryptocurrency exchanges in the country are exempt from anti-money laundering rules, a subtle signal that was interpreted positively by market watchers there.  The guidance stopped short of suggesting a shift in policy in favour of cryptocurrency, as observers believe the central bank is itself awaiting guidance on the matter from European regulators. Its latest statement is in line with guidance from the European Central Bank and European Banking Authority.  'Grexit' good for bitcoin?  On the macro front and also in Europe, Greek banks face a looming debt crisis and the possibility of the nation exiting the Eurozone. A so-called 'Grexit' now has a 50% chance of happening, according to an LNG Capital estimate quoted by Reuters.  Arthur Hayes of BitMEX adds the Swiss franc to the mix, painting a scenario where Greece leaves the Eurozone, causing panicked euro holders to pile into to Swiss franc as a safe haven. That's where bitcoin comes in, Hayes says, writing in his weekly Crypto Trader Digest.  As Swiss francs rise in demand, Switzerland would put in place capital controls – an unlikely prospect even Hayes admits – and thus create an opening for bitcoin.  He writes:  ""When faced with the real threat of government confiscation and sequester of their capital [investors] will begin to think outside the box. Bitcoin is one of the options on a menu of non-governmental assets ... on the margin, the Eurozone events could bring cash buyers back to the market and resurrect the bitcoin bull market.""  Wishful thinking, perhaps, for a bitcoin market in the doldrums.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Joon Ian Wong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/02/09/markets-weekly-slow-week-for-bitcoin-price-as-grexit-looms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e875b1f441e79fda46e2400fa5117c427735f469-900x500.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426262,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJLerh,1423476747,"Hong Kong's MyCoin Disappears With Up To $387 Million, Reports Claim","Reports are emerging from Hong Kong that local bitcoin exchange MyCoin has shut its doors, taking with it possibly as much as HK$3bn ($386.9m) in investor funds.  If true, the supposed losses are a staggering amount, although this estimate is based on the company's own earlier claims that it served 3,000 clients who had invested HK$1m ($129,000) each.  For perspective, bitcoin's entire market cap today stands at around USD$3bn.  The issue came to light on Friday when about 30 people claiming to be victims of the company's actions petitioned a local member of the Legislative Council, Leung Yiu-chung.  The victims are reportedly due to make a statement to Hong Kong police on Wednesday.  Ponzi scheme suspected  Adding to the mystery are reports the company never operated as a genuine bitcoin business at all. Testimonies from customers describe an operation more like a Ponzi scheme that used the veneer of bitcoin trading as its lure.  One local woman was quoted as saying:  ""We were told by those at higher tiers [of the scheme] that we can get our money back if we find more new clients.""  Adding to the business' pyramid-like feel were promises of cash prizes or Mercedes-Benz cars if customers could recruit new investors, said a report in Hong Kong's South China Morning Post.  Customers were never presented with receipts and were led to deposit their newly-acquired coins at a separate site to earn interest.  MyCoin had promised several months ago that it would soon be listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange, and according to photos posted online, also operated a bitcoin ATM.  Customers were promised returns of HK$1m in four months, and had been pressured into buying bitcoin-based contracts by real estate agents, insurance agents and law firm clerks. But after slowing down the release of payments and changing the rules to make it progressively more difficult to withdraw, the exchange's office boarded up its doors for ""renovations"" last month, the report says.  Regulation trigger  The incident could lead to greater regulation of the bitcoin industry in Hong Kong, which has so far operated with little scrutiny. Councilor Leung has said he wants to meet with Hong Kong's Monetary Authority to discuss better protections for bitcoin investors.  It's not the first time Hong Kong bitcoiners have found themselves out of pocket. Chinese trading platform GBL, purportedly based in Hong Kong, also disappeared in November 2013 with $4.1m in customer funds.  At the time of writing, MyCoin's site appeared to be still up and running, although there are clear indications all is not well. It is not possible to create a new account, and the listed bitcoin price is under $2.  Another Hong Kong exchange, KBBEX, has informed Leung that it is willing to provide assistance to help those affected, in order to regain trust in bitcoin and perhaps perform technical analysis if required.  Some posts in public forums appeared to confuse MyCoin with Maicoin, a reputable Taiwan-based bitcoin services company that is still functioning and healthy.  A Maicoin spokesperson said there had not been a material impact on the company's business, but an end to the confusion generated by the similar names would be welcome.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/02/09/hong-kongs-mycoin-disappears-with-up-to-387-million-reports-claim,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f64a085377fe711c1f044293b564697d7bf20539-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
