42378050,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LxXX,1425336629,European Central Bank: Digital Currencies 'Inherently Unstable',"The European Central Bank has released a new report on digital currency, describing it as “inherently unstable” but potentially transformative in the realm of payments.  The ECB study builds off an earlier study published in 2012, offering both a general overview of digital currencies as well as follow-up analysis on the potential benefits and risk of using so-called virtual currency schemes (VCS).  The central bank, which oversees national-level central banks in the eurozone, suggested in the report that digital currencies could impact the ECB’s ability to function. However, it stopped short of calling digital currencies a threat to its operations because of its lack of widespread adoption among consumers and businesses.  The report’s authors note:  “Although VCS units are not denominated in euro, they do have the potential to have an impact on monetary policy and price stability, financial stability and the smooth operation of payment systems in the euro area.”  The viewpoint echoes a report released last year by the Bank of England, which in September acknowledged that, if widely adopted, bitcoin could “severely impair” its ability to govern the UK monetary system. The Bank of England said in a study published last month that the technology could fundamentally change the way that central banks function.  Cross-border payments disruption  The ECB outlined a number of areas in which digital currency development could broadly impact the traditional payments space, noting that defects in the remittance ecosystem could provide an opportunity for the technology to flourish in the long term.  The report's authors state that digital currencies like bitcoin, given their cost structures, make the technology a potentially attractive option for both domestic and international remittances. While acknowledging the technological resources required to build such a network, the ECB notes:  ""...there is major room for improvement, especially in [the remittance] field, and hence a VCS could have the potential to offer a better service than traditional providers (banks, money remitters and informal remittance systems).""  The ECB goes on to say that a significant barrier to broader adoption for remittance is the lack of centralized protections for those who opt to use digital currencies.  ECB highlights risk of ‘scamcoins’  As well as including refrains of central bank warnings about digital currencies, such as a perceived lack of transparency and market volatility, the ECB also touched on the growth of altcoins.  The report suggested that altcoins may one day serve as future payment networks that, in the eyes of the ECB, could compete with bitcoin given the differences in design, distribution and implementation.  At the same time, the report highlighted how altcoins pose added risks for investors because of the nebulous nature of some projects, noting:  “It is too early to tell what the future of these altcoins will be. A great many of them could be nothing more than “scamcoins”, ie VCSs that are created with the main objective of swindling naive buyers, either as consumers and payers or as investors.”  Specific risks named in the report include a lack of specific information about an altcoin network's management, premining and market illiquidity.

42378065,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LxlN,1425330932,Alien Invasion iOS Game Lets Users Earn Bitcoin for App Referrals,"A new iOS app allows users to help save mankind from a “reptilian alien invasion” and earn bitcoins in the process.  Tigara Games  released its first title, Uranus Attacks!, for iOS users on 1st March. Built using the Coinbase API, users are rewarded with bitcoin dispensed in Coinbase wallets, about $0.05 according to developers, for encouraging others to enroll in the apocalyptic resistance effort.  The brainchild of developer Amer Qureshi, the release is the product of six months of development during which he sought to tie bitcoin into an iOS gaming experience.  Qureshi told CoinDesk:  ""I don’t know what the latest stats are, but there are only 2 million people with bitcoin out there, but think of how many people have games. With all of these people from the gaming side starting to get bitcoin for free, knowledge of bitcoin could grow beyond what it is today and that’s good for everyone.""  Bitcoin is also featured prominently in the design of the game, as users accumulate and spend virtual in-game bitcoins on items and to advance to new levels. Due to iOS restrictions, however, these in-game bitcoins have no real-world value.  Qureshi indicated that Tiagara is optimistic his team won’t face similar hurdles when it tries to launch the app on Android.  Uranus Attacks! is available for purchase for $2.99 to those with iPhone 5 models or newer. Purchase proceeds help fund development and to pay for the game’s referral program.  Gameplay  When users open the app, they’re greeted with a series of missions, 13 in total, each of which has an arcade-style scoreboard. Users materialize in outer space as a cartoon astronaut beset by space rocks and colorful aliens.  Users can tap to teleport to a new location on the board and double tap to release a blast radius of weaponry to dispose of the evil aliens. Should enough be killed in a single blast, cartoon bitcoins will appear to be scooped up by players.  Points are then redeemable for new levels and special weaponry, though a default bomb is always available for free.  Users can check their point levels via a 'Coin Bank' and purchase 1,000 in-game points for an additional $0.99.  Bitcoin-first app  Quershi explained that the idea for Uranus Attacks! was born out of his desire to help spread the bitcoin ecosystem to new users while increasing his own skills as an iOS developer.  “The intent was to create a game that could tie-in with with the bitcoin ecosystem,” Qureshi said, adding that the decision to choose iOS was partly influenced by the increased purchasing power of this demographic.  Going forward, however, he sees an opportunity in helping other developers use free bitcoin as a way to encourage others to share their apps.  The result is that this capability has been expanded by the team into a standalone product, a bitcoin referral platform for games called Coin-fu for which he projected there would be more updates soon.

42378068,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7Lxnt,1425324322,Bitcoin Startups Bring Rebittance Service to Argentina and Mexico,"Bitcoin startups Volabit and SatoshiTango have opened a money transfer service between their respective countries through a collaboration called Coinnect.  Volabit  framed the offering as a bitcoin-powered international money bridge for remittances and global commerce that will minimize the bitcoin learning curve.  Bitcoin is hidden from the Coinnect user experience. Those wanting to send money via Coinnect need only deal in their local currencies without worrying about bitcoin’s price volatility.  Volabit co-founder Tomas Alvarez told CoinDesk:  “We believe that bitcoin has huge untapped potential to change international money-sending beyond traditional remittances. Due to the inertia of old habits and trust lacking in new technologies, however, bitcoin services have failed to meaningfully compete against existing services thus far.”  SatoshiTango  CEO Matias Bari said that’s because most of bitcoin’s existing use cases impose a large responsibility on the users to understand the technology of the digital currency. Many bitcoin services are marketed to bitcoin’s earliest adopters, leaving the general consumer population overwhelmed by them.  By creating a network of bitcoin businesses that allow fiat-based international transactions, he hopes to foster mainstream adoption.  “No one knows how the TCP/IP protocol works, but we all buy things on eBay,” he said. “My vision is that we'll have to build layer after layer on top of the bitcoin protocol.”  Tapping the service  When a user in Buenos Aires sends $1,000 Argentine pesos, a Coinnect user in Mexico City receives $1,100 Mexican pesos. SatoshiTango and Volabit settle the amount between them in bitcoin.  Users on both sides of the transaction must have a verified account with either company. They need only log in and set up a transfer.  Bari said:  “They don't need to know anything about bitcoin. We took bitcoin out of the equation and moved it to the back end. So consumers are just paying in Argentine pesos, executing the transaction and someone is receiving Mexican pesos on the other side of the world.”  Customers can fund their accounts through the payments gateways associated with each exchange. In Argentina, for example, PagoFacil has more than 3,000 locations by which users can make cash deposits into their SatoshiTango accounts.  Bari said it is in talks with its bank to allow customers to be able to fund their accounts through wire transfer.  After funding their accounts, users can send money to any country with a Coinnect partner, each of which will have its own funding method.  As the system is still in testing, SatoshiTango and Volabit are the only partners for the time being.

42378067,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7Lxmd,1425320754,Is $518 the Fair Price of Bitcoin?,"Ask your average bitcoin enthusiast, and he or she will be quick to list the reasons why the price of bitcoin, even at $260, is undervalued, or at least, not properly reflective of its long-term value.  Now, however, those with a more bullish outlook have a new tool that can help them uncover bitcoin’s ‘intrinsic value’.  Recently launched by ALFAcoins, the ALFAquotes Fair Bitcoin Price indicator aims to illuminate what it considers the true value of bitcoin by factoring for the cost of bitcoin mining, or the production of the commodity itself.  At press time, ALFAquotes contends, while most bitcoin traders are buying and selling bitcoins for $259.46, the fair price is roughly double that, at $518.59.  The result, according to ALFAquotes project manager Denis Hertz, is a more accurate indicator that reflects the historical growth of bitcoin and its untapped potential.  Hertz told CoinDesk:  “Venture capitalists assign ‘beyond the clouds’ figures of $100,000. Financiers, that are far away from technology, say bitcoin has no intrinsic value. We decided to do the job of a fair price measurement that will help investors assess the attractiveness of bitcoin.”  ALFAquotes also includes an indicator of bitcoin’s potential, now +99.87%, calculated as the difference between fair price and market price.  Hertz went on to express his hope that the fair price, if widely adopted, would become a useful metric for market analysts, investors and mining companies, among others.  Historical influence  Though focused on the digital currency markets, Hertz indicated that the tool is inspired by the Benjamin Graham formula, a tool first proposed by Graham, the so-called 'father of value investing'.  The Benjamin Graham formula seeks to calculate the intrinsic value of an asset by including such factors as 12-month earnings per share and the company’s long-term earnings growth estimate, as well as corporate bond yields.  Hertz explained that ALFAquotes uses the formula as a model, though it is perhaps most influenced by metrics for the fair price of gold.  “We decided to assess the fair price of bitcoin as gold,” he explained.  However, such formulas are only models for investors, as evidenced by the ability for gold market analysts to reach varied conclusions on its value that may differ even more greatly than the cost ascribed by the market.  Calculating a ‘fair’ price  Hertz explained that the fair price formula includes two factors.  First, it calculates the changes in the cost of mining equipment and its performance. Next, it attempts to assess the change in difficulty of production, factoring in the electricity costs faced by miners on the network.  In particular, Hertz indicated that the fair value tool should be embraced by miners, as the price today is lower than the fair price – a factor he attributes to the recent string of bankruptcies and closures in the sector.  Hertz predicted that this trend is likely to continue until issues faced by the mining community affect supply to the point it influences demand.  “At the moment, as we can see bitcoin is doubly underestimated and this indicates how good investment attractiveness is toward bitcoin,” Hertz added.

42378052,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LxYn,1425314619,Olivier Janssens and Jim Harper Voted to Bitcoin Foundation Board,"Olivier Janssens and Jim Harper have become the Bitcoin Foundation's newest board members, following a recent election that was not without controversy.  The winning candidates received 277 and 264 votes respectively, from 440 eligible voters.  When asked about his objectives as a newly appointed board member, Janssens, a founder of Freedom Investment Group, said that he wanted to decentralise core development so that the core developers could be paid directly by the community, instead of having the Bitcoin Foundation ""sitting in between"".  Janssens continued:  ""Through public crowdfunding, there will be direct feedback between the core developers and the community, and the community will be able to put money towards the features that they like and want the most.""  Harper, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, said that his role would focus on ""building the foundation's stability and solidity"".  ""It is a young organisation that has had growing pains,"" he said. ""It will take stable leadership over some period of time to build its reputation in the bitcoin community.""  Both Janssens and Harper agree that there is a greater need for transparency, which, they say, will help the foundation connect with the bitcoin community.  Election criticised  The Bitcoin Foundation has faced some criticism for its management of the election.  Janssens said that the decision to change the ""whole voting system"" during the second round of the election was a surprise to everyone.  He continued: ""It is extremely strange to do this mid-election. What bothered people the most is that the process changed overnight, and was presented as fact in the morning.""  Harper said:  ""The election process was a little bumpy, as communications between the foundation and members have not always been strong. A well-intended run at blockchain voting was an interesting experiment showing that technologies take time and experience to mature and gain acceptance.""  ""In the end, I believe all candidates were satisfied with the fairness of the process. The energy and intensity of the bitcoin community were on full display, which is invigorating"", he added.  Despite the controversy, Brian Goss, election committee chair, said that the foundation appreciated ""all the feedback and suggestions for improvement along the way"".

42378072,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LxqP,1425299181,Markets Weekly: Bitcoin Price Rallies Amid Positive Newsflow,"The bitcoin price has jumped nearly 12% after four days of consecutive gains, hitting a high of $262.81 in today's trading so far, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index.  The price spike comes on the back of a relatively robust week of trading for the bitcoin price that was peppered with positive news for the digital currency.  News of the Bitcoin Investment Trust gaining regulatory approval for a public market listing in the United States broke yesterday, giving bitcoin bulls reason for cheer. The fund plans to make its shares available for trade on a US 'over-the-counter' market, potentially bringing increased liquidity into the bitcoin markets.    Bitcoin Investment Trust gets official OK to trade on public markets: http://t.co/u2TtnWDnVn — fantastic news for the whole ecosystem      — Tuur Demeester (@TuurDemeester) March 1, 2015      The rally started on Friday, when the bitcoin price jumped $20 in an hour, hitting a high of $257.50. The $20 spike represented a gain of about 8% from opening prices at the time.  Earlier gains were supported by news events earlier in the week that included the Bank of England talking up digital currency's potential to ""revolutionise"" payments. Researchers at another central bank, the Boston Federal Reserve, echoed this sentiment in an interview with CoinDesk.  The positive remarks from central banks were accompanied by significant merchant adoption moves from RE/MAX, a global property network, and T-Mobile in Poland. The Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten also recently signalled that it could begin taking bitcoin payments in the future.  Market watchers are cautiously optimistic that the breakout could signal greater gains to come.  Timo Schlaefer, co-founder of new derivatives exchange Crypto Facilities, said:  ""Looking at the chart, there is upside potential. There was little movement lately, and then such a spike draws lots of attention, possibly inducing more buys.""  However, Schlaefer sounded a guarded note about the price spike, pointing out that it hadn't quite bucked the bitcoin price's overall downtrend.  Backdrop of steady decline  The bitcoin price has declined steadily since last June, with a sharp crash at the start of the year that took the price from just above $300 to a low of $170, before rebounding to current levels.  ""I think we'd need to get above $400 for some time to consider the current downtrend ended,"" Schlaefer said.  Trading data on major exchanges showed OKCoin and Bitfinex leading the rally Friday, with an increase in volume at 3:38am on both platforms, according to data from Cryptowatch. Bitstamp followed suit three minutes later, as did the Coinbase exchange.  Sentiment on Bitfinexhttp://bfxdata.com/sentiment/longshort.php is in favour of further price gains, with long swaps taking up 63% of newly opened swaps at its peak, at 5:00am Friday.  Cryptocurrency pundits on r/BitcoinMarkets attributed the price jump to the end of the Spring Festival break in China, a weeklong holiday that's gained global significance as the world's largest annual human migration, as workers return to their hometowns to celebrate. The holiday officially ended on Wednesday.  Other market watchers thought the spate of good news was behind the breakout. Mike Rymanov, who runs the DSX exchange in London, said the Bank of England's bullish views towards blockchain technology could have rallied the market.  ""Announcements such as the BOE one certainly give a great deal of credibility to the blockchain technology and bitcoin, being the best manifestation, gets to benefit,"" he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Joon Ian Wong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/03/02/markets-weekly-bitcoin-price-rallies-amid-positive-newsflow,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9eb7c697e379212a3b6aa4da3b0ae633629ddbdb-1500x833.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The trust, which launched as a private fund for accredited investors in 2013, is not technically an exchange-traded fund (ETF). To speed up the process of approval, the BIT has made use of a legal loophole that enables public fund holders to sell their shares after a 12-month period.  Barry Silbert, creator of the Bitcoin Investment Trust, said:  ""Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT) shares have been assigned a temporary ticker symbol by FINRA in connection with approval of the Form 15c-211 filed by the BIT’s market maker.
