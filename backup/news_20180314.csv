42401281,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcQ0Qz,1521063921,Australia Warns of Fake 'Tax Collectors' Demanding Bitcoin,"The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) issued a warning about would-be scammers trying to con people out of their cryptocurrency.  Since late last year, scammers have been calling Australians and impersonating the tax office, claiming that the victims owed funds in unpaid taxes, and asking them to pay in bitcoin. So far, more than 50,000 Australian dollars (about $39,400 in U.S. dollars) have been sent to the scammers, according to a press release from the office.  The ATO warned that residents should be cautious about paying ""direct deposits into third-party bank accounts, demanding payment via iTunes cards or with a pre-paid Visa gift cards"" as well as cryptocurrencies.  According to the ATO's website, approved payment methods include credit and debit cards, bank transfers or online bill payment system BPAY. Crypto is not on the list.  ATO assistant commissioner Kath Anderson said it was ""inevitable that scammers would target cryptocurrency,"" noting its rise to prominence last year. She continued:  ""Cryptocurrency operates in a virtual world, and once the scammers receive payment, it's virtually impossible to get it back.""  Residents who are unsure about a purported tax call can contact the ATO, but any calls threatening police or legal action would not be from the ATO, according to the release.  Stepping back, there have been a number of similar scams around the world in the last several months. Most recently, Canadian police warned that people pretending to be from the Canada Revenue Agency were threatening to arrest victims with alleged unpaid taxes. That scam netted some 340,000 Canadian dollars ($267,000), as previously reported.  Other tax-related scams include a recent attempt to trick U.S. residents into investing retirement funds into ""IRS-approved"" cryptocurrencies. The Commodity Futures Trade Commission noted at the time that the Internal Revenue Service does not approve or review investments for retirement accounts.

42401296,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcQ0O2,1521060354,UK Crypto Exchange to Launch Bitcoin Futures Contracts,"A British cryptocurrency exchange is planning to enter the bitcoin futures market.  CoinfloorEX, a London-based exchange founded in 2013, announced Wednesday that it would launch bitcoin futures contracts next month, joining a number of other companies to offer such product to their customers, according to Reuters.  Notably, unlike some of its competitors, Coinfloor will offer physically settled futures contracts, the wire service reported, meaning when the contract is set to expire, the actual asset being traded will be delivered (in this case, bitcoin). The bitcoin futures contracts offered by CME and Cboe are cash settled, and do not deliver bitcoin to the contract’s owners.  The product came in response in part because of demand from some of the exchange's customers, Coinfloor co-founder Mark Lamb told Reuters. He explained:  “When you talk to the liquidity providers, they all say the same thing, which is they want a physically delivered futures contract so they can hedge their exposure across exchanges.”  Stepping back, Coinfloor is at least the fifth company to offer bitcoin futures contracts, joining Bitmex, CryptoFacilities, CME Group and the CBOE. The U.S.-based CME and Cboe offer cash-settled contracts, as does the UK-based CryptoFacilities.  The concept of bitcoin futures is still controversial, with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission announcing it would work on a ""heightened review process"" for any further futures contracts after receiving pushback on the existing products.  Similarly, several senators requested further information about the CFTC's oversight of such products, noting that taxpayers should be protected from ""fraud, manipulation and abusive practices in the futures and options markets.""

Twitter Reacts to House ICO Hearing,"Despite the overall measured tone among lawmakers at Wednesday's House subcommittee hearing on initial coin offerings, a few members of the panel made inflammatory statements.  Social media users responded in kind.  The most incendiary comment came from California Rep. Brad Sherman, who called cryptocurrencies a ""crock."" While some Twitter users merely encouraged him to educate himself on the topic, his incredulity that anyone would need alternatives to the legacy banking system and his warnings about a crypto-funded terror attack drew harsher responses.  Still other users simply found Sherman's ideas about the space amusing.  https://twitter.com/JHoffa9/status/973927231427956741https://twitter.com/SloppyProfits/status/973927383571902465  'A bright light'  At the other end of the spectrum, Minnesota Rep. Tom Emmer, a member of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, was lauded on crypto Twitter for breaking with his fellow lawmakers with a full-throated defense of the technology.  He argued that Congress should not attempt to regulate a subject it does not understand, and added that “access to capital is something Democrats and Republicans should celebrate.”  https://twitter.com/CryptoGodzilla/status/973965414488264704  Emmer’s statements were so positive that some on Twitter considered granting him the “cryptodaddy” title, which Commodity Futures Trading Commission chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo has held since his own hearing appearance last month.  Notable figures in the industry also weighed in on the hearing, including Stephen Palley of Anderson Kill, who recently started a practice at his firm focused on cleaning up messes in the crypto space.  Palley, who delights in needling blockchain advocates for making fanciful claims, poked fun at Emmer's passionate tone.  Despite the fireworks from Emmer and Sherman, Palley appeared to be generally unimpressed with the hearing:  Wednesday's hearing was the third such event in two months, though the conversation in Congress (and on Twitter) is likely to continue.  Rep. Bill Huizenga, the chairman of the subcommittee on capital markets, securities and investment, concluded the hearing by telling the panelists, ""I believe that this is probably hello and not goodbye.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | COMMODITY | MARKET | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,"Nikhilesh De, Annaliese Milano",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/03/14/crypto-is-a-crock-twitter-reacts-to-house-ico-hearing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3f1420c4239ee40855a8c05a247198bb43c1abc2-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The scam involved misstating the budget spent on food for state-run prisons, ultimately diverting funds worth $22.4 million – though only a small portion of the total was converted into bitcoin.  According to local reports, warrants were issued to search 28 sites, with seven people being held so far.

CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) had fallen to as low as $8,287.98 as of press time, representing a decline of more than $1,000 from the day's high of $9,313.03. Per BPI data, Wednesday's trading session began at $9,144.15.  That move closer toward the $8,000 level – suggested in the technical charts, as previously reported by CoinDesk – has come amid a decline in overall trading volume. At the same time, the price of bitcoin has fluctuated within this range in recent days, climbing above $10,000 less than a week ago before falling back down close to $9,000.  At press time, the price of bitcoin is trading at $8,308.82, BPI data shows, marking a decline of roughly 9.1 percent since the day's open. On February 13, the price of bitcoin slid to as low as $8,370.48, according to CoinDesk data.  The volatility seen in bitcoin prices this week has been seen in markets for other cryptocurrencies as well.  Data published by OnChainFX, which tracks the prices of cryptocurrencies, shows that the top 20 coins by market capitalization are all down for the day.

42401268,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcQ0FB,1521045613,ICOs Draw Fire at US Congressional Hearing,"""Congress has a responsibility to ensure that investors are protected without unduly preventing growth.""  So said U.S. Rep. Randy Hultgren of Illinois during a Wednesday hearing of the House Capital Markets, Securities and Investment Subcommittee, which met in the morning in Washington, D.C. Drawing a mix of academic and industry witnesses, the hearing highlighted the divergent viewpoints on the technology held by some of the members of Congress.  As is perhaps unsurprising, the hearing saw U.S. lawmakers strike both supportive and critical tones on cryptocurrency – one member called cryptocurrencies a ""crock"" in an opening statement while Rep. Tom Emmer, who appeared at a blockchain industry event last week, remarked that they constitute ""a huge topic that cannot possibly be scratched even in five minutes.""  Yet ultimately, many subcommittee members expressed a commitment to strike a balance between oversight and the accommodation of technological innovation.  Many of the questions focused on the regulatory parameters in place in the U.S. today, with some of those queries aimed at Mike Lempres, chief legal and risk officer for Coinbase and the sole representative from a startup working in the exchange space. Lempres, who joined the company in early 2017, advocated for a balanced approach to regulating the space.  Indeed, some of the members voiced a strong appetite for tackling regulation through legislative acts.  Rep. Maloney, who is the ranking Democrat on the subcommittee, explained that she is working on a cryptocurrency oversight bill that would cover exchanges that offer trading services for digital assets. And Rep. Bill Huizenga of Michigan, who is the chairman of the Capital Markets, Securities and Investment subcommittee, all but declared his intention to pursue some kind of legislative action.  ""This panel, this Congress is not going to sit by idly with a lack of protection for investors.""  Constituent interest  Notably, one of the panel members highlighted the interest apparently being expressed back home in his Congressional district.  Speaking during the hearing, Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota said that the topic had come up during recent weeks.  ""In my meetings with constituents over the last several months, I've had many of them say 'Hey, what's going on with this cryptocurrency, should I get into it?'"" he remarked, going on to ask:  ""If somebody wants to invest in this area what should they know as an unsophisticated investor?""  That question was fielded by Dr. Chris Brummer, a professor of law at the Georgetown University Law Center, who advised caution on that front.  ""I would certainly say that given the complexity of many of these instruments that it's very dangerous,"" he said.  Less, not more  By contrast, it was Rep. Tom Emmer – who is a member of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus – who took what was perhaps the most contrarian view compared to the remarks from Maloney and Huizenga.  ""I find myself maybe not with my colleagues on some of this,"" he said during the hearing, going on to say: ""Yet I hear elected officials who don't have any concept of what we're doing here ... talking about 'we have to go in and regulate.'""  Emmer remarked that that blockchain's potential in opening up capital access is ""something Democrats and Republicans should celebrate."" He also struck a favorable tone in comparison to some of the panelists – who argued that more clarity is needed around the regulations in place today versus the imposition of new rules on the industry.  ""I realize there has to be some regulation, but it's the balance,"" Emmer remarked. ""And I've heard from the panel we have regulation in place but we just need clarity.""  Even still, there was a palpable sense of wanting to strike the right balance among the committee members. This sentiment was perhaps expressed best by Rep. Ted Budd, who argued that oversight in this area is something that the U.S. ""has to get right.""  He remarked:  ""Regulation in this space is something that the U.S. has to get right. Because poor or rushed policy in cryptocurrencies really threatens our reputation in finance and technology.""

In a letter sent to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Monday, Nelson said he was “concerned by recent reports” that Venezuela, as well as Russia, are planning to use cryptocurrencies to get past economic sanctions.  Focusing on Venezuela's president, in particular, he noted that Nicolás Maduro “is responsible for persistent human rights violations, political repression and the jailing of opponents, undermining democratic institutions, corruption, and widespread economic deprivation.""  Nelson continued:  “Maduro’s regime is a criminal one and targeting the money that fuels it is critical – especially as he appears to be increasingly desperate for financing. Cryptocurrencies potentially offer Maduro and other bad actors the means to avoid banks and other intermediaries to hide their financial activity.”  The senator concluded his letter with several questions for Mnuchin, asking what the Treasury Department is already doing to prevent Maduro from raising funds via the petro, what it will do to crack down on exchanges which are not following sanctions and whether the department needs new authority to fight attempts to avoid sanctions, among others.  With the letter, he joins senators Bob Menendez and Marco Rubio in requesting that Mnuchin limit the use of the petro. In late January the two co-wrote a similar letter asking how the department could crack down on Venezuela’s attempt to bypass sanctions. Menendez’s office later said he was planning to follow-up with the department.  Venezuela debuted the controversial petro last month, launching a pre-sale near the end of February.  The oil-backed token is intended to act as legal tender within the country, by order of the president, though it cannot be exchanged for the existing Venezuelan bolivar. President Maduro has claimed to have raised as much as $5 billionhttps://hacked.com/venezuelas-petro-cryptocurrency-brings-in-5-billion-according-to-president-maduro/ through the pre-sale, but has not released any evidence to support this.

According to the Tampa Bay Times, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) has jailed Matthew McDermott, IT manager for the state government agency that oversees Florida's citrus industry. He is reportedly being held pending trial, with bail set at $5,000.  The FDLE alleges that McDermott used computers in the department to mine cryptocurrencies including bitcoin and litecoin, and has charged him with grand theft and official misconduct, according to the report.  An investigation further indicated that the utility bill of the department had surged by over 40 percent from October 2017 to January 2018, as cryptocurrency mining requires significant amounts of electricity due to its high processing demands.  The FDLE said McDermott had also purchased 24 graphic processing units on the office's account at a cost of around $22,000, according to the report. GPUs are commonly used for cryptocurrency mining given their ability to crunch numbers much faster than standard computer chips.  The news marks the latest instance in the U.S. of official employees being prosecuted for using public resources to mine cryptocurrencies.  Just last week, it was reported that the U.S. state of Louisiana has begun investigating former staffers for using official resources to the mining activity.

42401279,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcQ0Ry,1521032458,Huawei Is Building Tech That Can Stress Test Blockchains,"Huawei is inching closer to making its first major release in the open-source blockchain sector.  After almost a year of behind-the-scenes work, the tech giant recently valued at $7.5 billion has unveiled a tool designed to test the performance of major blockchains, one it is now preparing to submit formally to the Linux Foundation-led Hyperledger consortium this year.  Called Project Caliper, the open-source technology already supports analysis of Hyperleger Fabric, Hylerledger Sawtooth and Hyperledger Iroha, with more expected to be added by the end of 2018.  Still, Haojun Zhou, the Huawei engineer behind the vast majority of the code, described the tool as one that, while focused on analyzing technology, is fundamentally about helping developers and corporates make more confident decisions about their tech.  He told CoinDesk:  ""We thought it is a missing piece of blockchain and we can help to develop it.""  Simply put, the goal of the project, launched last May, is to integrate existing blockchains into a framework whereby they can easily be compared via standards set by Hyperledger's Performance and Scalability Working Group.  At the core of the benchmarking framework is an ""adaption layer"" that translates information so that Caliper can install smart contracts, invoke contracts or query the state of various distributed ledgers to best gauge their effectiveness.  Next, the code stress tests the supported blockchains in a controlled environment and generates results that include the success rate of transactions, the number of transactions per second, the time it takes transactions to settle and the consumption of resources required for all of these actions, such as CPU and memory.  Still, Zhou believes that the results would benefit any and all blockchain builders.  ""We are trying to contribute it to Hyperledger community so other parties can easily to join the work as other Hyperledger projects,"" he said.  Barriers to entry  Stepping back, however, it remains unknown just how widely used such a tool would be, given the competitive interests at play in the blockchain sector.  Following a path laid out by other contributors like IBM and Intel, even Huawei is protecting its other blockchain work with patents.  Javier Paz, the author of an Aite Group report who last year manually evaluated a list of major blockchains, for one, is skeptical that companies would let even their open-source projects be subject to scrutiny that could highlight any flaws.  ""I’m afraid that the work required to compare the effectiveness and progress of the various public and private chains will remain a manual and painstaking effort – where the networks are involved and feel comfortable sharing key performance statistics,"" he said.  There's even competition now forming among the telecommunications giants themselves, with Comcast, BT, Telefonica and T-Mobile – which recently successfully sued Huawei – all getting involved with blockchain in various ways.  As far as what else might be up Huawei's sleeve, Zhou would only confirm that Project Caliper is part of a bigger strategy, concluding:  ""Huawei, of course, is developing other blockchain projects.""

The drafts – covering both cryptocurrency and initial coin offering transactions, as well as a possible tax on crypto capital gains – first received agreement from government ministers on Tuesday.  Before becoming law, the legislation must be further reviewed by the Council of State, an advisory body reporting to Thailand's prime minister on legislative matters, before being re-submitted to the cabinet for final approval. That could occur as early as next week, according to the Bangkok Post.  Additional feedback from various regulators in the country will also be taken into consideration upon approval in principle of the decrees, including the Ministry of Finance, the Bank of Thailand, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Anti-Money Laundering Office, the report says.  A royal decree is one form of legislation in Thailand, which sets rules on emergent issues that may concern public safety.  The latest legal effort comes amid rising illicit use of cryptocurrencies in money-laundering, crime and tax avoidance, Thailand's deputy prime minister, Wissanu Krea-ngam, was quoted as saying  However, the deputy PM stressed that the intent is not to ban cryptocurrency activities, such as trading and initial coin offerings, but rather to establish formal rules to protect investors.  In addition, the second royal decree also aims to bring taxation on capital gains from cryptocurrency investments. The rate of the tax has yet to be determined, but is likely to range between 10 and 15 percent, according to the Post.  Previously, industry experts, through public consultation, have called for cryptocurrency rules to be implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in Thailand.  To that effort, Wissanu also said in the report that the Finance Ministry and the SEC are also working on an additional organic law that would require cryptocurrency exchanges, brokers and dealers to register with the relevant authorities.

According to a press release from the country's senate on Mar. 13, opposition senator Leila M. de Lima has filed a bill – SB 1694 – to the country's legislative house, seeking to raise penalties for crimes involving cryptocurrencies to one degree higher than currently.  De Lima also proposed that the severity of the sentence should also take into account the value of the cryptocurrencies' worth in Philippine pesos at the time the crime was committed. The crimes targeted, as the senator elaborated, may include payment for child pornography and bribery of public officials.  The digital assets involved in the crime, as the bill further suggests, would be subsequently confiscated by the government, unless they originally belonged to innocent parties.  The legislative effort comes a result of the senator noting increasing the difficulty of investigating crimes that make use of the anonymity-providing features of cryptocurrencies. As such, the bill has been filed in bid to more effectively counter the use of the financial technology in illicit activities.  De Lima states:  ""With the emerging threats of [cryptocurrency] use in the commission of crimes, our penal laws must adapt with the changing times and our criminal justice system must come prepared in the event that this is used in illegal activities.""  The legislative effort comes as Philippines regulators are increasing their efforts to curb cryptocurrency-related projects that are deemed suspect, while the country's securities agency is currently developing rules to determine the legal basis for activities such as initial coin offerings.

42401280,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcQ0Sx,1521020431,Bitcoin Sinks Toward $8K and Faces Further Sell-Off,"Following a failure to capitalize on a recent price recovery, bitcoin could be in for another sharp sell-off, the technical charts indicate.  The cryptocurrency found a temporary low of $8,371 on March 9 and jumped above $9,000 in a convincing manner on March 11, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). However, the corrective rally seems to have stalled over the past few days.  The cryptocurrency has spent a better part of the last 48 hours moving in a sideways manner in the narrow range of $8,800–$9,400. As of writing, the BPI is seen at $9,095 – down 0.5 percent for the session.  Notably, trading volume has dropped more than 50 percent since March 9, possibly indicating a lack of confidence among traders in the sustainability of the corrective move higher. Should bitcoin see a decisive move above $11,700 (recent high), volumes are likely to climb.  For now, however, the price chart analysis indicates an increased risk of a sell-off to the lows seen in February.  Daily chart  The above chart (prices as per Bitfinex) shows:  Despite the long-tailed doji candle and a bullish outside day reversal, bitcoin has not been able to scale the $10,000 mark. More importantly, it has repeatedly failed to hold above the double-top neckline resistance (former support) of $9,280. So, yesterday's doji candle likely shows bullish exhaustion rather than indecision in the marketplace.  Further, the 10-day moving average (MA) continues sloping downwards in favor of the bears.  Hence, the probability of a downside break of the inverted (bear) flag pattern (seen on the 4-hour chart below) is high.  4-hour chart  A downside break of the bear flag would signal a continuation of the sell-off from the recent highs around $11,700, and could yield a drop to $5,500 (target derived by subtracting the height of the flagpole from the eventual breakdown level, i.e. flag support).  It's also worth noting that a downside break of the inverted flag would only add credence to the bearish weekly relative strength index.  View  The probability of bitcoin prices falling below $8,600 (flag support) has increased. A bear flag breakdown could open doors for a drop to $6,000 (February low) and $5,500 (bear flag breakdown target).  On the higher side, only a daily close (as per UTC) above the 10-day moving average (currently seen at $9,619) would signal bearish invalidation.  A convincing break above $11,700 (recent high) will signal a bearish-to-bullish trend change.

Dubbed Jiami Tu, (or CryptoBunnies, in translation), the service allows users with Xiaomi accounts to adopt digital rabbits with different designs and built-in scarcity on a blockchain system that stores the transactions for each adoption. However, it's unclear at the moment whether the company is using a public or private blockchain to support the product.  Xiaomi said in a service agreement that, to start with, it will only issue a limited number of digital pets, starting at 11:00 a.m. Beijing time every day. The amount available daily is as yet undisclosed.  Despite a somewhat subdued launch for the testing phase of the new service, it seems to have seen enthusiastic engagement from users, with all the CryptoBunnies available for today being adopted within an hour of the service starting.  Xiaomi also specifically highlighted that the platform prohibits any fundraising or trading between fiat and cryptocurrencies through the new crypto collectible, a precaution that follows the China's ban on initial coin offerings and cryptocurrency trading last year.  The service marks growing interest from Chinese enterprises in developing blockchain applications as a way to trial the potential of the emerging technology and increase user engagement.  Xiaomi has already joined the Linux Foundation-backed blockchain consortium Hyperledger in bid to utilize blockchain technology to boost the firm's internet solutions.

42401267,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcQ0DD,1521014451,Ethereum Is Throwing Out the Crypto Governance Playbook,"“Can’t we just solve scaling? Can’t we just solve privacy? Can’t we just say ‘done’ and get to feature-complete?”  That was the question Bob Summerwill asked the audience at the ethereum conference EthCC in Paris on Thursday, the comments coming as part of a broader talk that called for an end to ""tribalism"" in the community supporting the world's second-largest blockchain.  Community manager at ethereum and an ambassador for blockchain alliance Sweetbridge, Summerwill opened the conference on a note that would reverberate throughout the next three days; that while the development of the ethereum ""world computer"" is a technical pursuit, it cannot escape social entanglements.  More recently, debates concerning the return of lost funds have demonstrated cracks in the platform's existing governance, which relies on a process borrowed from bitcoin and internet development, the request for proposal (RFP) process.  But while contentious changes tend to be avoided in bitcoin, ethereum developers have long warned that being too cautionary with code could lead to stagnation. “Otherwise we’ll be a sitting duck like bitcoin and be overtaken,” an audience member warned.  Still, lacking a forum to resolve debates, development platform GitHub has become somewhat of a battleground, with the ethereum codebase ruffled with political pull requests urging developers to “make ethereum immutable” or to increase the transparency of the Ethereum Foundation, the non-profit that oversees development.  As the conference showcased, ethereum developers are now faced with the problem of how to keep development fresh and adaptive in new ways without sacrificing technical scrutiny. Indeed, that fact was acknowledged in many of the week's panels and sessions.  “We recently had a huge amount of conflict,” Greg Colvin, developer of ethereum’s virtual machine, said at the first meeting of a new governance group that convened on Friday.  There, Colvin laid out his pitch for the Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians, a council that will aim to succeed in developing a unique governance model for ethereum.  According to Colvin, technical debates have been obscured by politics. However, with his new group, he hopes to cut through this issue by advocating for software changes driven by developers.  “It’s the developers who ultimately decide what goes into a hard fork,” Colvin said:  “For political issues, pass it on.”  Governance, abstract and applied  But as some struggled with more practical questions, one of ethereum's more well-known coders, Vlad Zamfir, sought to provide a theory that could be put to use.  In his speech, Zamfir described governance as a ""coordination problem,"" one in which arriving at a decision requires a shared knowledge that a set of decision-making processes is the norm.  “In bitcoin, we have a strong norm against contentious hard forks, and that norm really, really heavily structures the coordination that people do around [the software],” Zamfir continued.  However, when it comes to software changes, he said that blockchain design can provide natural checks and balances. In the case of bitcoin, he explained, those running nodes, or computers with full copies of the blockchain, can resist change.  Speaking at the fellowship meeting, Nick Johnson echoed this finding, stating that the decision that ultimately changes a blockchain's code is generally the final step in a long process of technical scrutiny.  Having followed the various steps of the EIP process, in which software is proposed, accepted, coded into clients and finally released, the upgrade is then subject to political analysis.  “Clients are released, people informed about what’s contained and they have the choice to run the hard fork client and agree or not run and continue with the legacy chain,” Johnson said in the meeting.  By pushing political decisions until later in the process, Johnson explained, developers have ample time to technically analyze a decision, something that has been denied in the persistent attacks on GitHub recently.  If the community rejects the change, it can always refuse to adopt it, something that Johnson described as “extreme and hopefully uncommon, but also a safety value.”  According to Johnson, contentious forks can help preserve the liberty of oppositional groups, explaining “you get two communities each of which is unanimous on one side of the debate .”  Following a blockchain split of this type, ethereum developer Jeff Coleman added, the “market decides” which version of the software is more valuable.  Money complicates  Johnson concluded by reminding the group that the EIP process is a tool, one that can also be changed with sufficient consensus.  “There’s nothing in ethereum that needs EIPs,” Johnson said. “If the process becomes sufficiently broken, people will just standardize these things elsewhere.""  However, it’s difficult to keep such a process technically pure, especially when there’s real money involved.  “The challenge for this community is that economic interest is not just something that motivates people to prefer something or to not want something. It’s also a technical characteristic of the network,” Coleman, a developer of scaling startup L4, observed.  Because of this, Coleman continued, “it is in some cases impossible to just look at neutral technical terms.”  Johnson agreed to this, stating that economic questions can be like “gravity within a technical discussion,” leading to unexpected deviations away from an objective argument.  And as noted by Johnson, the question of whether funds should be returned is a clear example where the boundaries between technical and economic concerns begin to blur. Plus, it’s hard to arrive at a technical proficiency if there’s a lack of clarity as to the direction of ethereum.  “It’s not enough to say that we want to be as technically good as possible, we need to say about what,” Johnson concluded.  Debate IRL  Going forward, the fellowship at least intends to provide a platform for in-person discussions, with the next panel due to occur in Berlin in July, hosted by the Web3 foundation.  Speaking in his lecture, Summerwill said the solution to many conflicts is to meet your enemies face to face, as the majority of debate today tends to occur online, where vitriol and anger spread easily.  Running through slides of selfies he’d taken alongside some of the platform’s more controversial figures, Summerwill stressed the importance of social processes, stating: ""In a quest to build the perfect machine we forgot to be human.""  Notes in Zamfir’s lecture also echoed this point.  While perhaps abstracted from the messiness of in-person debate, Zamfir acknowledged that governance is about more than simply making up mathematically sound rules.  He concluded:  “If you can come up with decision making rules by solving a maths problem, and you might have a really elegant rule, but if you can’t get people to agree to use it, then I don’t really think you’ve accomplished the goal of governance.”  Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians meeting via Lane Rettig",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | TRADING | FORKS,Rachel-Rose O'Leary,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2018/03/14/ethereum-is-throwing-out-the-crypto-governance-playbook,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/81a711fe11309858316354cd39c341fd858dc831-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a blog post published Tuesday, the firm indicated that it will change its existing financial product restriction list in June this year, blacklisting ad content ""including but not limited to initial coin offerings (ICO), cryptocurrency exchanges, cryptocurrency wallets, and cryptocurrency trading advice.""  ""Such ads will no longer be allowed to serve,"" the blog reads. The restriction will apply both to Google's proprietary and affiliated advertisement platforms.  The move comes just a month after social media giant Facebook also announced that it would enforce a similar policy that bans advertisements involving bitcoin and initial coin offerings in bid to prevent cryptocurrency-related promotions that may deceive investors.  While Google has not explained in details the reasons of its ban, the new policy comes at a time when regulators in the U.S. have been increasingly scrutinizing cryptocurrency projects that tout unrealistic investment opportunities and promote themselves to investors over the internet.  The latest moves by Google and Facebook – two of world's largest internet and advertising platforms – are also in line with U.S. regulators' effort at both state and federal levels in cracking down ICOs that appear dubious in the government's view.

42401260,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcOOPe,1521009708,Circle Rolls Out Crypto Investment App in 46 US States,"Four months after first announcing it, digital payments company Circle has officially launched its digital investment and storage app, Circle Invest.  Describing it as “an app that’s actually built around investing, not trends,” the company released the product for download via Apple’s App Store or Google Play on Tuesday in 46 states, excluding Minnesota, Wyoming, Hawaii and New York. The app was previously available to a select number of users for testing.  However, the company is working on making the app available in New York ""very soon,” according to an email sent to customers. Circle is one of four companies to receive a BitLicense from the state, which has stringent regulations on cryptocurrency exchanges.  According to a blog post, the app is still in the “early access availability” phase, though anyone can download it.  Users are invited to provide feedback on this version of the app, according to the post, which highlighted the app's planned benefits:  ""With no minimums, instant deposits, no commissions on a variety of coins, performance tracking and more — we've made it fast, cheap and simple to invest in crypto and digital assets, and we are only just getting started.""  The app allows users to invest or trade bitcoin, ethereum, bitcoin cash, ethereum classic and litecoin, with more tokens coming in the future, according to Circle's website. While XRP appeared in a screenshot in the initial announcement, the token was not listed on the app’s website as of press time.  Users can connect their bank accounts to facilitate instant deposits, while the platform also supplies market data.  Notably, the app offers commission-free trading. According to its website, Circle Invest makes its money by taking a 1.5-2 percent difference between a coin’s buy and sell prices.  For customer protection, users are offered offline storage, two-step verification and ""privacy protection,"" according to an email.  The app's launch comes weeks after Circle announced it had acquired cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex, which will serve as the foundation for a future crypto supermarket of sorts where all manner of digital tokens would be traded.

The U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority granted Coinbase an e-money license, the company announced Wednesday. The license now enables the company the ability to provide payment services and issue digital cash alternatives, which can then be used to make card, internet or phone payments.  A Coinbase spokesperson clarified that e-money is different from cryptocurrencies. As such, the license comes with stringent regulations designed to protect customers, according to the press release.  To that end, Coinbase explained:  “We are committed to making sure customer funds are always secure and this update means that our e-money operations have safeguards and operational standards at par with other regulated financial institutions. An example of this is segregation of client funds, where all customer fiat balances will be separated from Coinbase’s funds and kept in separate bank accounts.”  Notably, the FCA license allows Coinbase to operate in 23 EU member nations, though it is unclear whether the upcoming U.K. exit from the EU will affect that.  The spokesperson said that Coinbase can trade within the union until the so-called ""Brexit."" If certain rules allowing the company to continue trading are not preserved, the company will have to suspend operations until a second license from a member state has been granted.  In addition to its new e-money license, Coinbase announced it was joining the U.K. Faster Payments Scheme, which aims to provide efficient bank transfers to residents. While Coinbase will launch a pilot to begin with, every U.K. customer should have access within the next few weeks, according to the release.  The push into the U.K. and EU are part of Coinbase's efforts to meet increasing demand in the European market. To that end, the company also plans to multiply its London team by a factor of eight.

42401259,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcOOSb,1520996448,Unicorn Visions: Bitcoin's Startups Aren't Startups Anymore,"Marc Hochstein is the managing editor of CoinDesk.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      With all the regulatory actions and anti-climactic cable television appearances last week, you may have missed some telling news from two of the cryptocurrency space's bonafide unicorns.  First, Coinbase announced two high-profile hires: Emilie Choi, formerly of LinkedIn, who is charged with scouting out acquisitions and partnership opportunities; and Eric Scro, a former executive at the New York Stock Exchange, who will focus on institutional clients and financial and regulatory matters.  And while Chief Operating Officer Asiff Hirji's unveiling of the Coinbase Index Fund on CNBC may have been a letdown to those who were sure he was going to announce the exchange would be listing a new token (SFYL), taken together with the hires, the new product suggests this company has longer-term horizons than many people in the space assumed. (Hirji, it should be noted, is himself a recent hire who came on board in January.)  In other words, Coinbase may not be just a seven-year startup that aims to get acquired by PayPal. Rather than merger bait, it sees itself as a consolidator.  Consider Choi's comments in a Fortune interview.  ""There were just a bunch of really interesting startups that helped Google take things to the next level,"" she told the magazine, adding  ""So it feels like that kind of an atmosphere. We're seeing so much, so many interesting startups and entrepreneurs in the space...and Coinbase wants to capitalize on that.""  To be sure, Coinbase still has significant issues to work through.  Customer service complaints  are a longstanding problem, one that Twitter veteran Tina Bhatnagar, another January hire, surely can't fix overnight. Also, the resolution of Coinbase's fight with the IRS, while providing valuable certainty going forward, is likely to leave a sour taste with many of the thousands of cryptocurrency users whose account information will now be reported to the tax collector.  And once the only game in town for retail purchase of digital assets, Coinbase faces new competition in that field from Square and Robinhood.  Still, all things considered, the narrative that Coinbase is simply looking for an exit is a lot harder to support now.  Taking on the Fed?  Similarly, Bitmain last week revealed a somewhat out-of-left-field plan to invest in blockchain-powered ""private central banks"" – a signal that the company's controversial co-founder, Jihan Wu, has bigger ambitions beyond its flagship businesses of mining cryptocurrency and manufacturing the tools for it.  With China recently becoming less hospitable to miners, Bitmain has also quietly been setting up a subsidiary in the U.S. But Wu's comments at the D.C. Blockchain Summit made it clear that he has a lot more on his mind than running a back office for bitcoin.  “Since blockchain technology has been established for nine years, the technical barriers to running a central bank and issue a kind of private money [have fallen],"" he said.  Such private money ""may not be accepted but is at least theoretically easy to issue and use worldwide.”  That sounds closer to John D. Rockefeller or J. Pierpont Morgan than one of the green eyeshades those tycoons employed – much less a modern-day techbro looking to cash out.  All this talk of emulating Google or the Fed makes an awkward fit with the ethos of decentralization that inspired the technology that made Coinbase and Bitmain the companies they are today.  But say what you will about these two startups, you can't accuse them of thinking small.

42401242,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcOOBs,1520992436,Europe's Central Bank Touts Crypto As Underbanked Aid,"The European Central Bank (ECB) has said cryptocurrencies could “be an early sign of change” around the world.  In an opinion piece on Tuesday titled “Bitcoin is not the answer to a cashless society,” ECB executive board member Benoit Coeure and Bank of International Settlements Markets Committee chair Jacqueline Loh write that, while digital money may be the way of the future, existing public cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are not that future.  Rather, the pair tout the potential of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) in changing the way consumers have control of their money.  Still, the piece acknowledged that cryptocurrencies are addressing an important shortfall in current banking systems, noting, “Despite its many faults, bitcoin has put the spotlight on an old failing of our current system: cross-border retail payments.""  The authors continue:  “Such payments not only permit shoppers to easily buy goods online from overseas, but also allow foreign workers to send money home, supporting financial inclusion and development. However, [existing] payment channels are generally much slower, less transparent and way more expensive than domestic ones.”  To address this failing, central banks must improve international payment channels and rise to the challenge bitcoin is presenting fiat currencies, the opinion piece asserts.  The article also outlined the potential role a central bank-backed cryptocurrency could play, noting that consumers are already increasingly using digital payment systems instead of cash. Creating a central bank digital currency would grant consumers direct access to funds, rather than forcing them to go through a bank.  Stepping back, the comments echo those made in a Bank for International Settlements (BIS) report yesterday, which highlighted perceived issues with CBDCs, specifically noting that they could give customers the power to fuel faster runs, thus draining banks’ digital coffers during periods of financial instability.  However, the piece did emphasize that a central bank-backed cryptocurrency is possible, echoing remarks made by People’s Bank of China chairman Zhou Xiaochuan, who last week said it was “inevitable” that the country would one day have a national digital currency of its own.
