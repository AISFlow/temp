42398812,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgcJF,1446147094,Capital One Survey Finds Blockchain Interest Growing at Money20/20,"Nearly 20% of attendees at this year’s Money20/20 conference in Las Vegas believe that blockchain technology will have the greatest impact on the financial services space over the next three to five years.  Capturing 19% of the responses, blockchain technology surpassed the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence, which garnered 17% and 9% of the vote, respectively. In total, 53% said that big data analytics and alternative payments would have the most impact by 2020.  “Respondents within the investment, media, government and consultant business were more likely to rank blockchain higher than those in payments and financial services or mobile and retail businesses,” the report reads.  The findings are the result of a survey of 151 conference attendees conducted by Capital One, the ninth largest US bank by deposits and a recent participant in blockchain technology startup Chain’s $30m Series A funding round.  Elsewhere, blockchain technology ranked favorably in a question on the future of financial security, with 17% of respondents indicating it will have the biggest impact on payments fraud prevention over the next three to five years.  Here, blockchain technology was edged out by biometrics (28%) and tokenization (27%), though it garnered more responses than EMV (14%) and facial recognition (12%).  The survey comes amid growing public interest in blockchain technology among major payment processing firms.  Present at Money20/20 were Visa and MasterCard, both of which made announcements in the blockchain space, the former debuting a proof-of-concept for blockchain insurance contracts and the latter investing in industry fund Digital Currency Group.

42398800,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgcAO,1446145793,Heartland CEO: Blockchain Could Power Trillions in Bank Transactions,"“I wish I could give you a grand leading vision.”  It’s the first thing Heartland CEO Bob Carr says as he sits down in the media room at Money20/20, the modern white leather couch clashing with his holiday sweater. We’re talking about the buzz around the bitcoin blockchain, the technology’s decentralized ledger, and how it relates to the future of his New Jersey-based payments firm.  Frankly, I’m surprised he arrived. With all the chasing that goes into setting up meetings, it’s a bit startling the CEO of the fifth largest merchant acquirer in the US would venture down to the press room for the kind of theoretical conversations bitcoin and blockchain discussions often spiral into, especially when it was only loosely on our schedules.  My hesitation for the meeting was not without reason. We’re both not exactly sure what to talk about, both armed with the awareness that the narrative around the technology is shifting away from Heartland’s specialities like payment services and e-commerce.  When Heartland signed a deal to refer its merchant customers to BitPay in March of this year, the industry was just a few months removed from Microsoft’s decision to accept the digital currency, and even then, payments director Joe Wysocki expressed how the company was moving slowly on the technology.  Despite warnings signs at the time, there was still optimism that other big-name merchants would quickly follow, but data from Q3 illustrates this resurgence hasn’t came to pass. This doesn’t seem to bother Carr, who gives the impression that he’s still genuinely interested in the technology, even if he struggles to see its practical applications for his business.  We wade into conversation, and talk comes slowly and with ample pauses on either side. In a way, it’s honest, devoid of the eager soundbytes that come when meeting payments firms that seek an easy headline opportunity.  Carr told CoinDesk:  ”I’ve noticed a lot more discussion about blockchain. I have been asking experts, ‘What should we be doing here?’, ‘How much time should we be spending on this?’ Usually the answer is stay tuned and see how things develop.”  It’s not much to work with – the admission that, like Money20/20, the finance industry is a crowded room, filled with technologies and products that come and go, and that in this light, it’s just not clear what the next steps for his company will be with the technology.  Still, he seems inclined to believe that the promise of distributed ledgers is the real opportunity given the increasing momentum toward this use case.  ""It seems to me that the play is for banks [to use blockchain] to settle between themselves. There’s trillions in very high-end transactions going back and forth across borders between businesses,"" he said, adding without any real vigor:  ""That might be the breakthrough.""  Eliminating middlemen  Carr continues pragmatically, noting he sees evidence of this elsewhere at the conference.  More top of mind than any blockchain product for Carr is Chase Pay, the new mobile payments app rolled out by the US bank to a swirl of promising headlines. Interestingly, he sees how its design mirrors the underlying strengths of distributed financial technology.  As Chase Pay works by cutting the major credit card processors out of transactions, Carr notes the app removes interchange fees for merchants in the same way the blockchain does when consumers pay merchants directly for services in bitcoin.  Given innovations like Chase Pay, however, Carr doesn’t see as strong a use case for bitcoin as a consumer-facing digital currency, the use case most of his merchant clients are most interested in.  “I think blockchain is a more serious technology, whereas bitcoin is an implementation of technology that has a lot of questions,” he added, though he admits he’s not exactly an expert on the subject.  Heartland, he suggests, operates on a need-to-know basis, and right now, there might just not be that much pragmatic, customer-focused businesses need to know about bitcoin and the blockchain.  Payments evangelism  As the conversation ebbs on, it’s still not clear which camp to put Carr into, whether he’s a pragmatist or cautious optimist.  Carr, however, begins to offer more insight, eventually identifying himself as an evangelist for payments technology as a whole. He smirks often when talking about how others may dismiss innovation, as if he’s a gambling man, or at least someone who lives by a kind of never-say-never philosophy.  It comes out over discussion about the attention on bitcoin and blockchain technologies at the conference. Given the breadth of the content, many of the industry attendees seem to feel a natural falling off in enthusiasm, if only for the girth of other options.  “I think bitcoin and blockchain have gotten a lot of trade press,” he counters. “There’s a lot of evangelists out there and a lot of copy, but there’s also a lack of adoption by credible people, though I think it’s happening slowly.”  Carr places bitcoin and the blockchain as part of the larger story of payment technology, where a small pool of believers eventually bring about seismic change in the financial industry. He compares this to the ATM boom that brought cash vending machines to corners across the developed world.  “You get to the famous tipping point, where you get past early adopters and there’s a more rapid adoption ratio,” he said. “I think that’s what we’re going to see with these technologies.”  With the conversation fading out, he gets up to leave, his skeptical optimism leaving a bit of a wake. He turns and asks me where I think it’s heading. I don’t have a strong answer.  “Well, someday you’ll look back and say you were there at the beginning,” he says, maybe at last revealing his hand.

42398803,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgcEK,1446136398,Deloitte Partners With Blockchain Startup Colu,"Coloured coins startup Colu has revealed it is embarking on a partnership with multinational consulting firm Deloitte.  A Monday blog posthttp://blog.colu.co/colu-blog/2015/10/27/new-announcements-new-releases-new-integrations from the Tel Aviv firm, which launched its open beta in August, said the collaboration will bring blockchain technology to ""big new markets"".  Though details are scarce, the project will involve Rubix, the software platform that lets Deloitte clients build their own apps – including ticketing systems and registries – on the blockchain.  Amos Meiri, Colu's CEO, told CoinDesk:  ""For the last couple of months we've been meeting with Deloitte representatives and building a close relationship with Deloitte Canada and the Rubix team. As they started to work with some of their clients on different interesting use cases they needed our help with on the tech side and defining different PoCs [Proof of Concepts].""  In July, the 'big four' professional services firm revealed to CoinDesk it had found over 20 use cases for blockchain technology, having carried out research in the sector for over 18 months.  Besides Colu; Blockstream, Counterparty and Ethereum are known to be under testing at Deloitte, with some clients ""still in the exploratory phase"" and others further down the PoC pipeline.  Deloitte has also formed an 100-member group named the Deloitte Cryptocurrency Community across 12 countries, including Canada. It's primary aim is to help banking and retail clients understand how the technology can disrupt legacy systems and create entirely new ones.  About Colu  Using the open-source protocol Colored Coins, Colu lets its users 'colour' a tiny fraction of a bitcoin with a specific attribute. This, in essence, ties it to a real-world asset while keeping bitcoin's best attributes – including its cryptographic security and fraud-proof ledger. Users can issue and trackhttp://blog.colu.co/ their digital assets on its platform.  ""It's a method of attaching metadata to a blockchain transaction, it's an abstract and generic way of extending the capabilities of a single asset blockchain while keeping the metadata secured and immutable,"" Meiri said.  Colu is aiming to make the process more accessible to non-developers by hiding the technical nitty gritty and negating the need for its users to own bitcoin at all (Colu covers the cost of all transactions).  While there are templates for issuing things like securities, cryptocurrencies and tickets, users have the ability to create their own use cases. One example is the 'Smart Lock' created by Colu's 13-year-old intern, Jonathan Ohayon, which demoed at Money20/20 this week.  Meiri explained:  ""We wanted a smart door for our office and looked for solutions in the market that didn't satisfy us, so then Jonathan just took our mobile app and API and connected it to our physical door ... We can now give access easily to our office by sending a digital asset through the Colu app.""  In its three-month span, Colu has racked up more than 20 company integrations including music platform Revelator, Caribbean bitcoin exchange Bitt, and now Deloitte.  ""It is fascinating to see how blockchain technology could be applied by different companies building different applications. We are following that diverse variety and are excited to discover the many use cases we haven’t even thought about,"" the company's blog post reads.

42398802,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgcDL,1446133051,Digital Asset Holdings to Acquire Blockchain Startup Blockstack,"San Francisco-based blockchain startup Blockstack.io has entered into an acquisition agreement with Digital Asset Holdings.  The deal, announced this morning, marks the latest acquisition by Digital Asset, which announced it had purchased blockchain startups Bits of Proof and Hyperledger earlier this year.  Launched in June, Blockstack is one of a number of startups seeking to offer private blockchain services to the world’s finance industry. In August, CEO Peter Shiau told CoinDesk his company was working with prospective clients to better understand how the technology can be applied to traditional financial services.  According to today’s announcement, the acquisition deal will see a merger of Digital Asset’s and Blockstack’s services.  Digital Asset CEO Blythe Masters said:  “Blockstack’s solutions will enhance the existing Digital Asset technology stack and [Blockstack CTO Miron Cuperman], a renowned pioneer in the blockchain world, adds tremendous technical expertise to our development team.”  Shiau said in a statement today that the acquisition will allow for the offering of blockchain solutions at greater scale.  “Digital Asset’s technical approach is very complementary, and the combined firm will have the leadership and resources to scale its platform,” he remarked.  The actual terms of the agreement, including the amount for which Blockstack is being purchased, was not directly disclosed in the announcement. Digital Asset and Blockstack were not immediately available for comment.

42398814,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgcNB,1446128758,How Payment Giants Are Embracing Bitcoin and Blockchain Tech,"MasterCard's participation in Digital Currency Group's undisclosed funding round sent ripples of excitement across the crypto-sphere earlier this week.  While this is MasterCard's first crypto-related investment, the multinational corporation is not the first mainstream finance company to dip its toe in the bitcoin and blockchain technology pool.  Banks have publicly embraced blockchain technology and prominent figures from traditional finance have also lauded its potential. But how exactly are payment giants such as MasterCard interacting with the world of crypto?  Be it through direct investment, partnerships with companies in the space or public comments on bitcoin and its underlying technology, here's a round-up of some of the most notable interactions between payment giants and the world of crypto.  1. MasterCard  Founded: 1966  Company type: Public  Company size: Over 10,000 employees.  Reported revenue: $2.4 net revenue for the fourth quarter of 2014 – a 14% increase versus the same period in 2013.  American payments giant MasterCard was one of 11 investors in Barry Silbert's Digital Currency Group's (DCG) new undisclosed funding round.  The news came months after the multinational corporation claimed the risks presented by digital currencies far outweighed the benefits in its submission to the UK Treasury's call for information on digital currencies, last November.  Matthew Driver, MasterCard's president for South East Asia was also critical of digital currencies in December 2014, following the company line that cryptocurrencies presented too many risks.  Driver said  MasterCard was ""not completely comfortable with the idea of cryptocurrencies"", adding that the technology was ""against the whole principle"" on which the credit card giant had established its business.  Reports surfaced that MasterCard had spoken out against bitcoin's perceived risks, calling for regulators to create a ""level playing field"" for payments systems:  ""It is our view that all participants in the payments system that provide similar services to consumers should be regulated in the same way to achieve a level playing field for all. Moreover, any regulations should be technology neutral to ensure that they can and do apply to all new providers of payment services to consumers, especially with advancements in technology.""  MasterCard filed a patent application to be able to incorporate bitcoin into the design of a proposed online shopping cart which would be rolled out to its global customers. Despite this, MasterCard insisted the filing should not be perceived as the company's support of bitcoin.  2. Visa    Founded: 1958  Company type: Public  Company size: between 5,001 and 10,000 employees  Reported revenue: GAAP net income in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2014 was $1.1bn, a decrease of 10% over the prior year.  Like MasterCard, Visa has also invested in the crypto space, contributing to blockchain startup Chain's $30m funding round.  Earlier this week, Visa revealed a new proof-of-concept that leverages bitcoin's blockchain for record keeping.  Debuted at Money 20/20 in Las Vegas, the project sets out to digitise the car rental process, using bitcoin transactions to create a digital fingerprint for each vehicle on the blockchain. Visa is involved in the project through its technology innovation arm.  Unlike MasterCard, which has been generally dismissive about digital currencies, some Visa executives have spoken positively about bitcoin and its blockchain in the past.  Speaking at Wired Money this summer  , Jonathan Vaux, executive director of new digital payments and strategy at Visa Europe, said:  “The one thing I often get asked about is bitcoin. I do see … a separation between the currency and the technology that sits under it. From the point of view of currency, I think that's interesting. As Visa, that's what we do – we manage currencies.”    Visa CEO Charlie Scharf spoke about bitcoin in January last year. ""There are certainly some interesting things about bitcoin and other things like it, but there are also a great deal of complexities,"" he said.      Schartf went on to suggest that Visa was not actively monitoring the bitcoin space: ""We feel quite comfortable with the business we have here.""    3. American Express  Founded: 1850  Company type: Public  Company size: over 10,000 employees  Reported revenue: American Express earned a record $5.9bn in net income in 2014, up 10% from the prior year.  American Express  ' VC arm invested in bitcoin-to-cash app Abra as part of its recent $12m Series A round.  Speaking to CoinDesk, AmEx Ventures managing partner Harshul Sanghi said it was too soon to know how the company may leverage blockchain technology.  ""Let's see what currencies are important and we'll transact in the currencies that our customers want to transact in,"" he said, adding that the company was paying closer attention to possible blockchain technology applications:  ""As we watch the digital currency industry develop, we have seen that blockchain technology and the distributed ledger can play an important role in shaping the future.""  Sanghi's remarks come after the company's CEO Kenneth Chenault spoke about digital currencies in December last year.  Similar to his contemporaries, Chenault said he saw more potential for bitcoin's underlying blockchain technology than the digital currency itself.  “The protocol of bitcoin is going to be important,"" he said.  4. PayPal  Founded: 1998  Company type: Public  Company size: Over 10,000 employees  Reported revenue: $8bn in 2o14.  Online payments leader PayPal announced its first partnerships in the bitcoin space in September 2014.  At the time, the company's senior director of corporate strategy Scott Ellison, said the company was ""proceeding gradually, supporting bitcoin in some ways today and holding off on other ways until we see how things develop"".  Bitcoin payment processors BitPay, GoCoin and Coinbase told CoinDesk the partnership had been months in the making.  Rumours of a possible bitcoin-related partnership first surfaced at the beginning of September 2014, after the company released a new promotional video which mentioned bitcoin.  Earlier that year, John Donahoe – CEO of PayPal at the time – hinted at possible bitcoin integration. In an interview with CNBC, the former CEO said:  ""I think there's no doubt digital currency is going to play an important role going forward, and at PayPal, we're going to have to integrate digital currencies into our wallet.""  PayPal  also held an introductory bitcoin event as part of a monthly speaker series in January 2015.

42398813,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgcMC,1446116426,Bitcoin and Blockchain Square Off at Money20/20,"It may have been called (Bit)coinWorld, but the blockchain was the talk of Money20/20.  For the second year in a row, the Las Vegas-based financial conference dedicated a track (dubbed (Bit)coinWorld) to the technology, however, 2015 was heavily focused on the blockchain, bitcoin's distributed ledger, spurred by proof-of-concept debuts from news-grabbers such as Nasdaq and Visa.  A topic of frequent discussion both in panel sessions and in private was this ongoing shift in the industry’s larger branding and positioning to the general public. Sides split between self-identified “true believers” who continue to espouse the long-term benefits of the bitcoin blockchain, the longest-running open and public version of a distributed ledger, even as pragmatic entrepreneurs garner attention for decentralized ledger projects that enable financial incumbents to create ledgers with restricted access.  Of debate was whether the change was one of terminology, an interest in one word over another, or whether such a rebranding was a recasting of the larger political implications inherent in bitcoin’s technology, and if so, what would be lost should the differences between the bitcoin blockchain and decentralized ledgers be unsuccessfully articulated.  Among representatives of the more tenured bitcoin startups, consensus emerged that conversation can be expected to turn back to bitcoin next year, as banks begin to “see the light” regarding the benefits of the bitcoin blockchain over alternatives.  Colu  CEO Amos Meiri, who previewed his bitcoin-based digital asset platformhttp://blog.colu.co/colu-blog/2015/10/27/new-announcements-new-releases-new-integrations at the event, talked about the frustrations of positioning a company amidst the debate, telling CoinDesk:  “It's hard to explain bitcoin [to people here], they don't understand if they don't have bitcoin, there is no public blockchain, so it's not easy for them to digest. They hear banks are using blockchain and it's easier than hearing bitcoin, but next year we'll go back to bitcoin.”  Elsewhere, Adam White, product manager at bitcoin services startup Coinbase, fought against the idea that proprietary decentralized ledgers were “some magic pill” for financial institutions, stressing that the term ""blockchain"" hides the fact bitcoin is the only decentralized ledger with traction and scale.  Tally Capital  ’s Matt Roszak, in his panel talk, voiced his opinion that the name change was more pragmatic on the part of banks, saying:  “I think [bitcoin and the blockchain] are inextricably linked. The marketing powers have said let’s call this stuff blockchain so we can invest in technology, and the compliance department isn’t going to get bent out of shape.”  Regardless, the debate was perhaps rightly seized on by industry representatives due to the myriad of other issues facing development of the bitcoin blockchain, including an ongoing slump in merchant adoption, consecutive quarter-over-quarter drops in venture capital funding and the ongoing inability for the development community to reach consensus on how to resolve network scalability concerns, all of which were largely unaddressed.  Ghost of AOL  Notable at the conference was that support for the view that the bitcoin blockchain is potentially the most beneficial version of the technology among more educated representatives of the incumbent financial industry.  “It’s interesting if you look at the blockchain, the biggest innovation is bitcoin,” Cassio Goldschmidt, principal information security leader at NCR Corporation, said.  Goldschmidt evoked a common theme at the conference, that private or restricted-access versions of decentralized ledgers risked repeating the mistakes of AOL.  He said:  ""That’s something that I’ve heard some people using, this sort of analogy, and I think there is some value. You could start with an intranet and that is a valid way of starting things, but you don’t want to be locked into somebody’s proprietary technology.""  This view was also put forth by Xapo chief strategy officer and former AOL business affairs manager Ted Rogers, who spoke to CoinDesk about his experience with the Internet giant.  ""[Consumers] thought AOL was the Internet, but it was just a walled garden built on an open platform, and what was happening while they were seemingly winning, was that people like Google and others were building services on top of this permissionless innovation structure that eventually destroyed AOL,"" he recalled.  Dave Birch, director of innovation at Consult Hyperion, suggested the debate was more than just a battle of words, telling CoinDesk he sympathized with the frustration of those in the industry, as words carry deeper implications.  “Permissioned in technical blockchain terms, is not the same as what [the banks] are doing,” he said. “Our names for things are technical names for things and you have to be really careful when you’re using them in the public space.”  Others like Adam Vaziri, director of compliance consulting firm Diacle LTD, said he believes the focus on terminology risks limiting the diversity that could come about should alternative ledgers coexist with the main blockchain while expanding the technology's reach.  'Perception battle'  The view of the bitcoin industry companies on the issue was perhaps best on display during a roundtable featuring Digital Currency Group founder Barry Silbert and Blockchain CEO Peter Smith.  Beginning with a high level discussion on the respective companies, the talk featured a number of references to the ongoing split in the industry regarding how the technology is positioned and how it is affecting business decisions.  ""Today we’re all building blockchain companies. You need to be aware of how to situate your business in the perception battle,"" Smith told the crowd, noting that he feels this will be particularly important for companies looking to raise funds in the next six months.  Smith believes the major financial institutions that are today interested in private blockchains, either based on bitcoin or another protocol, will eventually come to the “logical conclusion” that the bitcoin blockchain is a superior platform.  “Every single industry that has been shaped by technology has been shaped by the movement to mass open platforms,” Smith said, sprinkling his talk with remarks about how the bitcoin blockchain is one of the only large-scale versions of a decentralized ledger.  “It’s the difference between incremental change and fundamental change,” he continued.  Silbert, however, was more pragmatic in his response to questions calling the development of alternative blockchains ""not a bad thing"" given that private systems are allowing mainstream financial institutions to feel more comfortable engaging in the industry.  'False choice'  The split between the bitcoin blockchain and alternative distributed ledgers again reared its head during a panel discussion on how the industry will work with financial incumbents, with Bobby Lee, CEO of bitcoin exchange BTCC, and Todd McDonald, CEO of distributed ledger startup R3CEV, trading terse words.  McDonald, whose startup is working with major banks to explore as-yet-unreleased distributed ledger concepts, took issue with the idea that all alternative ledgers are “centralized” or “private” as often categorized by more established bitcoin firms.  ""You need a open platform, but one of the things that's untenable today is open access to validation. You can have permission without centralization,"" McDonald said, adding his belief that financial institutions can’t rely on an open mining network such as the one used to incentivize the bitcoin blockchain due to regulatory concerns.  The brief spat was mediated by Prasad Chintamaneni, president of banking and financial services, at IT and consulting firm Cognizant, who sought to delineate what he suggested was the inherent advantage of a global open ledger, like the bitcoin blockchain.  “How many enterprises are leveraging public cloud? It's about data privacy and security. A private cloud has [fewer] benefits, but it will be way more secure,” he said.  Chain’s big vision  Of the industry companies assembled, none arrived in a bigger show of force than Chain, the startup that recently raised $30m from firms including Capital One, Nasdaq and Visa, and staged a Blockchain Workshop that showcased four proofs-of-concept built with brand-name partners.  Cementing Chain’s position in the industry was CEO Adam Ludwin’s control of the conversation on a panel that included distributed ledger startup Ripple and its partners Royal Bank Canada and Toronto Dominion (TD) Bank.  In his remarks, Ludwin touched on his company’s transition from one that attempted to build on the bitcoin blockchain to one that specializes in “blockchain infrastructure”. He described the latter term as pertaining to a “new type of database technology” for financial assets that, while being built for specific use cases on specific networks, would eventually become interoperable.  Ludwin stressed that he does see a difference between “blockchain” and “bitcoin” in terms of the goals of the systems, stating:  ”Bitcoin wasn’t designed for banks … and that’s fine. Another way to frame the question is what do bitcoin companies think of financial services advancing tech? My perspective is it’s taking pressure off bitcoin to let it be what it is, a way to move money with an Internet connection.”  Also discussed was the different tone around blockchain technology discussions when compared to those surrounding bitcoin, which moderator and CoinDesk CEO Jeremy Bonney characterized as a veritable love affair. In a more candid moment, the remarks ended in Royal Bank of Canada’s head of mobile innovation Eddy Ortiz openly embracing Ludwin onstage.  Still, even major financial representatives, such as Nasdaq associate vice president Dominick Paniscotti, dismissed the bitcoin versus blockchain argument, given that the Internet is a sum of many technologies working in concert.  He concluded:  ""At Nasdaq, you can go to our website, but you can’t access our trading platform. It still runs ethernet, IP, TCP, so is that less valuable than the Internet? When we talk private or public blockchains, I think it just confuses the matter.""
