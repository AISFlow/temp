Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin and other cryptos plummet.  Insights: Will Gucci's entry into the crypto world have staying power?  Technician's take: BTC is in danger of breaking below a short-term uptrend.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $36,515 -7.9%  Ether (ETH): $2,747 -6.5%  Biggest Gainers  There are no gainers in CoinDesk 20 today.  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Cardano ADA −11.5% Smart Contract Platform Polkadot DOT −10.9% Smart Contract Platform Algorand ALGO −10.8% Smart Contract Platform  A rough day for cryptos  Bitcoin plunged. Equities swooned.  Wednesday's assets rally seemed like a distant memory as investors faced the cold reality of higher interest rates and a global economy that is shaking to its core.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization fell by as much as 10%, dropping below $36,000, its lowest level since January. Bitcoin was more recently trading just above $36,500, off about 8% over the past 24 hours. Ether, the second largest crypto, was trading at about $2,750, its lowest mark since March and down 6.5% from the previous day.  Other major altcoins fell significantly into the red a day after a relief rally that followed the Federal Reserve's long-awaited announcement of a half-point interest rate hike with ADA, AVAX and AXS down 10%, 11% and 12% respectively at one point.  On Wednesday, investors had piled into cryptos and other higher risk assets after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell highlighted the strength of the U.S. economy and said that the Fed wouldn't consider a three-quarter point increase at its next meeting. Powell's comments soothed investors, who have been fearful that the Fed's recent aggressiveness will send the U.S. economy into recession. Those fears returned with a vengeance on Thursday as companies weighed the impact of rising prices on the consumer spending that has fueled economic growth.  Equity markets were hard-hit with the tech-focused Nasdaq plummeting over 1,000 points, its poorest performance since 2020. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average each tumbled over 3%. Even gold, a usual comfort zone for risk-shy investors, dropped almost a percentage point.  ""There was a complete loss of confidence on Wall Street,"" Oanda Americas senior market analyst Edward Moya told CoinDesk. ""Yesterday's risk-on rally, which sent equities, cryptos and all risky assets higher as investors are starting to have doubts with the global economic recovery. There's a major, de-risking moment happening that's sending cryptos down sharply.""  Moya said that Powell may have overplayed his hand in telegraphing the Fed's unwillingness to boost rates in larger increments. ""He showed the markets that he might not be ready to fully fight inflation,"" Moya said, adding that bitcoin support at $33,000 will be key and that volatility similar to the past two days is likely to repeat.  ""We should not be surprised if we continue to see those types of swings over the next several days,"" Moya said.  Markets  S&P 500: 4,146 -3.5%  DJIA: 32,997 -3.1%  Nasdaq: 12,317 -4.9%  Gold: $1,877 -0.8%  Insights  Will Gucci's latest crypto initiative work?  Gucci has announced that it plans to accept crypto at some stores around the U.S. The question is, how long will this endeavor last?  For Tesla (TSLA), it lasted just over three months before it decided to shutter the payment offering, citing environmental concerns. But the reality is, few people – if anyone – actually bought a Tesla with bitcoin because of the tax liability when liquidating the bitcoin and the administrative burden of new anti-money laundering filings required for any purchase of goods worth over $10,000.  It’s not surprising then that most of the retail payment volume for merchants comes from cheaper goods. BitPay, which operates one of the larger crypto merchant services, reports that the majority of its volume comes from transactions involving prepaid or gift cards, internet services, virtual private networks or games. The company says it sees about 70,000 transactions per month and has processed $5 billion in transactions since its launch a decade ago. That might seem like a lot, but is scant considering crypto exchange Binance processes $18 billion in trades per day.  For a while, one of the few successful high-value industries that accepted crypto as a payment method was real estate in Thailand. Most new developments target foreign nationals, and developers saw this as a way to attract the crypto nouveau riche who wanted their own slice of the ""land of smiles.""  But Thai authorities weren’t comfortable with the arrangement. While Thailand has a reputation as a place to hide money from the law, local authorities have been working hard to update anti-money laundering laws and get the country off the U.S. State Department’s list of “countries of primary concern” for money laundering.  Real estate has historically come up as a money-laundering vector with some high-profile names being targeted by Thai police. When the Thai Securities and Exchange Commission banned crypto as a payment method in March, this was undoubtedly on its mind.  Luxury goods like Gucci products are an even easier way to launder money than real estate. The Gucci brand is widely loved, and its goods are in demand worldwide creating a liquid market. Criminals have long used luxury items as a way to integrate dirty money back into the banking system because these goods can be bought and resold with relative ease while preserving their value.  So for Gucci, those who want to purchase goods worth over $10,000 will need to file paperwork reporting their purchase. Gucci’s compliance and risk analysis teams may have an even lower threshold for crypto transactions because of money-laundering concerns. This undoubtedly would create a friction point for consumers, and the more of these there are, the less attractive a payment method becomes.  Let’s see how long Gucci’s crypto payment option lasts. Unlike Tesla, the company doesn’t have a strong ESG (environmental, governance and social) mandate, and maintaining the crypto merchant services doesn’t require much overhead. But how many people will actually make a transaction?  Technician's take  Bitcoin Dips Below $38K, Support at $30K-$32K  Bitcoin may break below a series of higher price lows that has formed a trend since Jan. 24, which could yield further downside toward the $30,000-$32,000 support zone.  Still, a daily close above $37,500 could signal short-term stabilization. For now, upside appears to be limited despite intraday price swings, evidenced by slowing momentum on the daily, weekly and monthly charts.  The slope of the 100-day moving average has flattened over the past few months, which indicates weakness in the relief phase since the Jan. 24 price low near $32,900. Immediate resistance is seen at $40,000, which could limit buying activity over the short term.  Additionally, selling volume isn't as extreme compared with previous down moves in price. That suggests further downside is likely before sellers capitulate.  The 20-day moving average of BTC's trading volume based on Coinbase exchange data provided by TradingView declined from February to April, reflecting weak buying pressure within the $35,000-$46,000 price range.  The uptick in volume since late April, although negligible, should be monitored for signs of heightened selling pressure, which could signal a brief price low of around $30,000.

42420815,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYcO5,1651792029,"‘Smart Money’ Wallets Accumulate GAL, Decrease APE Holdings: Nansen Data","Following the launch of Project Galaxy on Thursday, profitable cryptocurrency traders have taken a large position in GAL, the Web 3 credential data network’s governance token, data from blockchain analytics firm Nansen suggests.  In the past 24 hours, ""smart money"" wallets have scooped up roughly $4 million worth of GAL, more than any other token monitored by the firm.  Nansen has compiled lists of top 100 addresses in terms of estimated profits of their current NFT (non-fungible token) portfolios and top 100 addresses based on an internal “hodler score metric.” Using these metrics, Nansen considers a wallet to be “smart money” if it is “historically profitable,” meaning it meets at least one of several conditions, including:  Making at least $100,000 by providing liquidity to decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, SushiSwap and Uniswap, excluding so-called impermanent losses.  Having at least more than or equal to five times in realized profits on multiple NFT collections that were minted in the last 60 months.  Having made multiple trades on decentralized exchanges in a single transaction that are profitable.  Belonging to an investment fund that invests and manages money in crypto.  According to Project Galaxy’s documents, “GAL token holders have the ability to control the amount of the platform fee collected by the protocol, and control funds held by the Project Galaxy Community Treasury.”  For example, at launch, Binance opened trading with GAL/BTC, GAL/BNB, GAL/BUSD and GAL/USDT. BNB, BUSD and CAKE token stakers are able to farm GAL tokens until May 27.  Gnosis Safe Multisig sent 3 million GAL in two transactions to a Binance Deposit address, identified by Nansen. Here is the first transaction and here is the second transaction.  Interestingly, the top six GAL transactions showed the same multisig sending tens of millions of GAL tokens to six different token vesting contracts. 0x0B31 received 16.4 million GAL tokens, roughly $250 million, while 0x8793 received 35.2 million GAL tokens worth about $550 million, the highest amount of GAL sent from the six transactions.  Meanwhile, smart money wallets have been letting go of their APE. In the past 24 hours, $1.1 million worth of APE has left their wallets. Typically, outflows are a harbinger of decreasing asset prices; APE has dropped 16.2% in the past 24 hours.  In the same 24 hours, PXN: Ghost Division has been the most actively traded NFT collection, according to Nansen’s data. PXN: Ghost Division, with 19,398 ETH in volume activity has dethroned Yuga Labs’ NFT collections that have been dominating the top rankings in the past few days.  Nansen is one of many firms that parse publicly available information about crypto transactions, although unlike Chainanalysis and similar firms, its services are geared toward giving investors an edge rather than helping law enforcement catch bad actors.  While cryptocurrency addresses appear on public blockchains as random-seeming strings of letters and numbers, Nansen uses algorithms, its own investigations and information submitted by users to draw inferences about the entities behind pseudonymous wallets.",POSITIVE,BNB | APE,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | ZRX | BNB | APE,Sage D.

42374761,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw2czl,1651790415,US Court Orders BitMEX Founders to Pay $30M for Illegal Trading,"A federal judge ordered the three co-founders of BitMEX to pay a total of $30 million for operating an illegal cryptocurrency derivatives platform and violating money-laundering rules, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said in a statement on Thursday.  The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ordered the platform’s founders – Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo and Samuel Reed – to each pay a $10 million penalty in connection with CFTC accusations that they illegally conducted business with U.S. customers. The order followed the February resolution of a related Department of Justice case in which the three pleaded guilty to violations of the Bank Secrecy Act for running the crypto spot and derivatives trading platform without proper controls against money laundering.  Related to that plea, they are still awaiting sentencing “in the upcoming weeks,” according to the CFTC.  In 2020, the U.S. derivatives regulator first sanctioned the company and its founders for “unlawfully accepting orders and funds from U.S. customers to trade cryptocurrencies, including derivatives on bitcoin [BTC], ether [ETH] and litecoin [LTC].” This week’s penalties stem from that CFTC action, in which the company had previously agreed to pay the agency and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) $100 million.  “This is another example of the commission taking decisive action where appropriate to ensure that digital asset derivatives trading platforms comply with the Commodity Exchange Act and Commission regulations,” CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam said in a statement.  Caroline Pham, who was recently sworn in as one of the agency's new commissioners, said these latest orders ""highlight the CFTC’s leading role in bringing digital assets within the regulatory perimeter so that important protections for customers and market participants apply.""  The CFTC said the co-founders “failed to implement and enforce effective controls to prevent or detect BitMEX’s unlawful conduct.”  A spokesman for Hayes declined to comment. Lawyers representing the other co-founders couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.  BitMEX spokesman Taylor Bossung said the company is aware of the developments but won’t comment on legal matters that don't directly involve the company.  “It’s business as usual, and we are focused on launching the BitMEX spot exchange in the coming weeks and expanding the platform further to serve our customers,” Bossung said.

The Los Angeles-born painter, who has an identical twin sister and is also the granddaughter of billionaire businessman and philanthropist Warren Buffett, the world’s fifth wealthiest person.  But the San Francisco-raised NFT artist hasn’t always concurred with her grandfather, who holds a more old-fashioned approach to technology. Over the weekend, during the annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholder’s meeting, the elder Buffett dismissed cryptocurrency, saying he would not buy all the bitcoin (BTC) in the world for $25.  Read more: Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger Still Hate Crypto  That hasn’t deterred the cross-medium artist, who has yet to have a crypto conversation with her grandfather. If and when she does, she plans to highlight NFTs’ growing influence on how we value products and services.  “NFTs are expanding our view of currency money,” she said on CoinDesk TV’s ""First Mover.""  She dove into NFTs at the beginning of the pandemic. To Buffett, it became a way to connect with her audience and a way to share her work. “Translating my work into the digital sphere allowed me to open up new dimensions on different levels,” she said.  Still, Buffett continues to produce physical works of art first before turning them into NFTs. She sees this as a way to honor the full artistic process. It’s “a way to trace it [art creation] back to its origin, outside of the digital realm,” she said.  Some, including her grandfather, may argue that NFTs do not inherently produce anything. Rather, their value depends on the amount that people are willing to pay for them.  People who have already joined the cryptocurrency and NFT space will play a major role in attracting skeptics, such as Buffett’s grandfather. “The scope of the lens is widening,” she said. The cryptocurrency space is dynamic, where “financial experts, technologists and artists are getting together to create a bigger entity.”  Buffett recently reconnected with her grandfather, who reached out via email for the first time in years, to express his support for her NFT success. She is planning an NFT-based art show this fall in Omaha, Nebraska, her grandfather's hometown.  When it comes to NFTs, “what excites my grandfather the most is that it’s really giving artists a chance to share their work, make a living on their work and express themselves,” she said. “If there’s anything that’s going to open him up to the world of NFTs and crypto it is that.”  CORRECTION (May 6, 2022, 03:00 UTC): Corrects spelling of Buffett in first paragraph, and that Nicole Buffett has an identical twin sister, and is not a triplet.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | TECHNOLOGY,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/05/05/nicole-buffett-on-nfts-their-future-and-explaining-them-to-her-grandfather,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fc1a222316919e7efa0ceddb49185761cc7c214f-1908x1102.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The risk-off tone among market participants has been a dominant theme this year despite short-term price swings.  Bitcoin (BTC), the world's largest crypto by market cap, dropped by as much as 10%, reversing Wednesday's rise toward $40,000. The decline Thursday was the largest price drop in two months.  Meanwhile, alternative cryptos (altcoins) such as Solana's SOL token and Avalanche's AVAX token saw similar declines of about 10% over the past 24 hours. Popular meme coins such as Dogecoin's DOGE and Shiba Inu's SHIB declined by 5% and 7%, respectively.  Just launched! Please sign up for our daily Market Wrap newsletter explaining what happens in crypto markets – and why.  Bitcoin'sselling volume isn't as extreme relative to previous price downturns. That suggests further downside is likely before sellers capitulate. Technical indicators point to further downside toward the $30,000-$32,000 support zone as momentum weakens.  And in the futures market, a large amount of open interest was added to the market during Wednesday's rally. During Thursday's sell-off, almost all of that open interest was closed out, according to Glassnode, a crypto data provider.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  The chart below shows the spike in long BTC liquidations over the past 24 hours, which reached the highest level since April 10.  Liquidations occur when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position as a safety mechanism due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. That happens primarily in futures trading, which only tracks asset prices, as opposed to spot trading, where traders own the actual assets.  Selling intensified later during the New York trading day, which pushed bitcoin below $36,000. That triggered an uptick in long liquidations. From a technical perspective, the sharp price drop rejected support at $37,500, which was the lower end of a three-month price range.  Over the past month, option traders were actively hedging against further price drops and purchasing front-month volatility contracts. That contributed to a bearish tone among market participants, which preceded the current sell-off.  Supply meets demand?  On the flip side, it appears that selling pressure was met with renewed buying interest from the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG).  On Thursday, the foundation reported that it has acquired $1.5 billion in bitcoin to bolster the reserves of its Terra (LUNA) stablecoin. The purchase was conducted using over-the-counter swaps, which included one billion TerraUSD (UST) for $1 billion worth of BTC. Afterward, the foundation purchased an additional $500 million worth of BTC.  The newly acquired BTC brings the LFG’s total holdings to about 80,394 bitcoins, worth just shy of $3 billion. LFG aims to have accumulated a total of $10 billion in stablecoin reserves before the end of the third quarter.  ""From the flows side, we are also watching progress on the Mt. Gox settlement to see when bitcoin payments totaling about $7 billion-$8 billion could potentially arrive in the market, which could be as early as the second half of 2022 or delayed until 2023,"" David Duong, head of institutional research at Coinbase, wrote in a report earlier this week.  ""This could potentially be offset by purchases of bitcoin (or other tokens) to shore up stablecoin reserves, comparable to the LFG flows we saw in March and early April,"" Duong wrote.  Theoretically, persistent buying from LFG and others could absorb recent selling among traders.

42421592,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoi4r,1651779534,The Scarcity Mindset Driving Crypto's Energy Critics,"The New York State Assembly may be the latest legislative body to consider banning proof-of-work mining – but it likely won’t be the last.  The persistent criticism of cryptocurrency mining’s energy consumption reflects a deeply pessimistic perspective: No amount of energy consumption by crypto will ever be permissible because society cannot afford to waste energy on this kind of technology.  Miller Whitehouse-Levine is the policy director at the DeFi Education Fund.  According to crypto’s skeptics, even one joule is too much to spend on crypto. But this pessimism is mistaken – not least because it does not accurately reflect the overall consumption trends in crypto mining.  At its heart, concern over crypto’s energy consumption is wrong because it advances an outdated, practically Malthusian scarcity mindset about energy production and consumption overall.  Why are we haggling over who consumes this or that ever-so-scarce kilowatt of electricity, when the technology for energy abundance is already here? This isn’t the 1970s; we don’t have to ration.  See also: Nic Carter: The Frustrating, Maddening Bitcoin Energy Debate | Opinion  We can, instead, focus our policy and regulations on creating an energy abundant future – a future in which energy is too cheap to meter and everyone can have a little crypto, as a treat.  Actual abundance  Energy abundance is the right way to address energy consumption concerns, and not just because it will silence crypto’s critics, but because it is the only way to improve a whole host of other issues as well. We know that increases in energy consumption per capita lead to improvements in the quality of life for everyone across a number of metrics; over the last two hundred years, every improvement in the standard of living has strongly correlated with per-capita consumption.  Yet, in recent decades, energy consumption per capita has hovered at about the same level. Much of that can be attributed to encouraging increased efficiency standards, but that isn’t the whole story. Time and again, environmentalists and energy consumption critics have shut down, blockaded or otherwise just plain stigmatized increases in production and consumption.  The reduce, reuse, recycle mindset has dominated energy and environmental discussions for decades. Rather than helping us imagine how much better the future might be in a world of abundance, today’s advocates and activists want us to make heavy sacrifices in our lives now, in the hope that the future will be slightly less terrible – if we only kept energy use down.  That’s hardly an inspiring political and social vision; cut back now and you might eke out an OK life down the road.  Real concerns  Powerful interest groups embracing this preservation-first and scarcity-based mindset are holding back our potential abundant future on several fronts. Take New York as one example.  The Sierra Club in New York has adamantly opposed any expansion of bitcoin mining in the state, citing the environmental impact of Bitcoin’s energy consumption rates. At the same time, it has opposed energy projects like New York City’s plan to build transmission lines to bring hydroelectric power from Canada into the city. It would seem that neither low-to-zero carbon energy sources nor new developments of financial technology that would benefit their fellow citizens is a worthwhile investment for anti-abundance environmentalists.  When crypto’s defenders try to argue against these interest groups, they’re adopting a false framing of the issue. Why are we trying to justify crypto’s energy consumption at all?  See also: We Can Use as Much Energy as We Want, Forever | Opinion  We should, instead, be asking politicians and activists what their plans are to multiply by 100 the amount of zero carbon energy available to humanity in the years to come. We should all be asking ourselves, how do we invest in a world where energy is so cheap and so abundant that we can mine as much crypto as we want and operate as broad and extensive networks as necessary, without needing to count costs?  This shouldn’t be beyond the scope of our collective imagination. In fact, we’ve already imagined it in ""Star Trek.""  ""Star Trek"" offers a compelling vision of a utopian future where the civilization of the 24th century has a superabundance of available energy and spends it on galactic-level hobbies, building spaceships and exploring the galaxy – instead of political infighting (well, there is some).  While that world’s warp drives are more fiction than science, we possess all of the necessary technology right now to electrify our entire world and tackle some of humanity’s toughest challenges.  Crypto’s energy usage is a small bore issue with a lot of emotional, political and social valence. We should work toward a world where we have so much energy available that the debate about consumption fades away and we can finally move on to the more important questions about improving quality of life for everyone on the planet through energy abundance.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Miller Whitehouse-Levine,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/05/05/the-scarcity-mindset-driving-cryptos-energy-critics,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/43c1b5a232b91dc2d68f76321a73765906b30953-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42421169,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXd4zl,1651779163,Cherie Hu on Music and the Metaverse,"Over the past few years, Cherie Hu has become one of the music business’s most reliable prognosticators – the kind of specialist who knows exactly where the market is going, and how it’s going to get there. As the founder of Water & Music, a research platform and newsletter dedicated to music’s overlap with the tech industry, she’s delivered meticulous research on subjects like social tokens, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and conventional music tech startups to an army of devoted subscribers.  This article is part of Road to Consensus, a series highlighting speakers and the big ideas they will discuss at Consensus 2022, CoinDesk's festival of the year June 9-12 in Austin, Texas. Learn more.  Late last year, after participating in a crypto accelerator program called Seed Club, Hu began reorganizing that community around tokens, rather than Patreon subscriptions. The result was the Water & Music DAO, or decentralized autonomous organization – an online space centered around a homemade cryptocurrency.  The Water & Music roster features leaders from just about every major music project in crypto; if you care about music and tech, odds are you’re already a member.  Ahead of her panel at Consensus 2022, Hu spoke with CoinDesk about the state of music NFTs and where things might be headed from here.  This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.  Water & Music just announced a report about music in the metaverse – what most interests you right now, in that space?  I've thought about this a lot with any technology, and especially with Web 3: What forms of music creation, or consumption, or monetization feel native to a given technology, and not just just copying and pasting a business model that already exists?  I'm excited by what happens when music creation becomes a lot more tactile. There's a startup called Wave XR that did this early on – they've since pivoted – but they would partner with artists on making these interactive, immersive worlds around their music in VR, such that you could literally pick up stems, and depending on how you interacted with them or moved them around in the space, it would trigger different kinds of sounds. It was making or remixing music through movement. That idea is super interesting to me – I feel like there's so many different ways that you could play around with that in these virtual environments.  I personally have done a lot of research in the past on music and gaming, and there's a lot of hype in the industry about the commercial opportunity. Like, Travis Scott making millions in a Fortnite show, or Lil Nas X in Roblox.  But I think game worlds as new storytelling mediums are even more interesting to me. The best games are not just interactive, but also very personal and dependent on the player. So what happens when you take a more standard, linear way of telling stories through music – like a song – and put it in this kind of interactive environment? How does that change the way that you communicate the underlying narrative, or the way that fans or players or members relate to that narrative?  Do you feel like that Travis Scott Fortnite show was a watershed moment for the virtual concert idea? It felt sort of unexpected at the time, but in retrospect it feels like the start of a trend.  Timing also, of course, played a huge role, because it was right at the start of the pandemic. I remember a ton of articles being published around then, being like, “this format is the future of concerts.” I guess just because there were no IRL alternatives. And so even even looking at Epic Games, and how they evolved their music strategies since then, I think they've only done that kind of concert with a very small handful of artists.  I think Ariana Grande is the only other artist who they did a concert of that scale, in terms of making it fully immersive, interactive. And they hosted a bunch of other music events in the no-combat battle royale part of their game, but they were just YouTube videos embedded in a screen, so it wasn't very interactive.  The main takeaway there is that I don't think that model is the future. Putting on shows of that scale is super expensive, and then because it's expensive, game developers only want to partner with the biggest celebrities to make it worthwhile. So that model doesn't seem super accessible to me.  I was super intrigued by the very DIY, customized nature of a lot of the Minecraft festivals that were happening around the same time. And there it's kind of the opposite model: Anyone can spin up their own Minecraft server and create their own world, invite people in. It's more or less completely open. It's also a lot less “custom” in the aesthetic – there's so much you can build in a Minecraft world, but it's very much a specific Minecraft aesthetic.  That's more where I see the future going, in terms of tools that enable more artists to make their own worlds. Minecraft isn't free, but in terms of access to building these custom worlds, it’s just much more accessible.  I remember in the early days of the pandemic, after the Travis Scott collaboration with Fortnite, there was a Minecraft show with 100 Gecs and Charli XCX that felt a lot more lo-fi. Less slick, more customizable and accessible.  To Fortnite’s credit, for the Travis Scott show, it felt unique to the game world. This is also a big challenge, and something that we’ll look into for this next season: how these experiences mesh, or don't mesh, with IRL experiences. I think music livestreaming, the demand for that has kind of stagnated or gone down. There was a lot of hype for online concerts in general, and tons of startups were spinning up around it, but I think general activity or demand has gone down.  Or if you look at metrics on Twitch, in their music category, it's kind of stayed the same over the last year or so. I don't know if part of that is the novelty wearing off – part of it is also, COVID notwithstanding, actual IRL music experiences and concerts like coming back. So in terms of people who want to build these experiences online, I think there's even more pressure, but also an imperative to make sure it's genuinely interesting and can only really be experienced online and in a digital environment, without physical constraints.  There’s also the caveat that most metaverse “concerts” aren’t really live – they’re typically just pre-recorded, right?  Yes. The audio is prerecorded, but people's avatars you can see reacting in real time. The social part of the quote, unquote concert was live, but the performance part was not. In terms of future music metaverse experiences, in terms of what the tech allows for today, I think there's a lot more active experimentation and cool things that can also be done at the social layer and not just at the performance layer.  Where does crypto fit into this, if it does at all?  There's a whole school of thought around what the metaverse requires to be realized that is inseparable from Web 3. I think one core theoretical underpinning of the metaverse is this notion of interoperable identity, and I think that also connects really well to what a lot of people are building for in Web 3, which is being able to have this platform-agnostic identity model, platform-agnostic assets and data ownership that you take with you. It's not centralized or dependent on any one platform.  There's been a lot of discussion and interest in the idea – in gaming, for example – of being able to have an avatar, or some kind of NFT or PFP [profile picture] travel with you across game worlds. And then of course, in gaming, there's already an established economy around virtual goods, and like that driving revenue for a ton of games. That also arguably could map well onto NFTs.  On the complete opposite side of the spectrum, you have Facebook/Meta. I would also put Epic Games into this category of an extremely centralized vision of the metaverse. And it's weird because that side of the spectrum uses a lot of similar language. The way that Mark Zuckerberg will talk about the metaverse and how that plays into all the different platforms under the Meta parent company – it is interoperable, in this very centralized context. Like, being able to take your identity and your social graph with you across all these different apps.  Of course, it's still one company owning all that data, and Epic Games is definitely similar. I'm thinking of their Bandcamp acquisition, which was part of a bunch of acquisitions they've done of these more indie art marketplaces catering to indie creators. It’s centralized ownership of this network of indie marketplaces because they want to make it easier for indie game developers to build their own games using Epic technology.  Something that, at least in the music industry, we hope to be able to do through our research, is start to just make people aware that these fundamentally contradictory visions for the metaverse exist.  How does that notion of interoperability or platform-resistance square with existing competition between companies? Why would private companies want users taking assets off-platform? And how would that even work, logistically?  The ironic thing is that because Web 3 is so decentralized, there's no consensus or shared standard on what kind of information to include in an NFT. And I think especially as the music/Web 3 landscape expands, I can see this becoming a problem for interoperability very quickly.  For example – and this resembles a problem in the music industry, without even introducing the complexity of Web 3 – but the vast majority of music NFT platforms, the way they structure their metadata, I think of it as “single player.” It assumes that there's only one minting wallet. [And] not only that there's only one minting wallet, but that there's only one wallet that should receive all the revenue. It definitely favors completely DIY artists – they are their own manager, they do their own production, songwriting, and engineering.  The concept of even crediting collaborators, let alone splitting the revenue with them, is relatively new. Splits protocols on music NFTs have only really started to get used in a more public way in the last couple of months. And NFTs minted on OpenSea – the fields that they have to credit collaborators are completely different from what a more music specific NFT platform like Sound or like Catalog might want to make room for. I don't know if that's competition, per se, as it is because it's decentralized. All these different platforms are going to have their own incentives, the irony being that an NFT minted on one platform might not actually map that well to another platform.  What even is a music NFT in 2022? How can we define that if there are no standards for what kinds of data music NFTs include? And how do you see the market maturing around that?  NFTs are just data containers, at the end of the day. They represent a relationship between the person who minted the NFT and the person who buys it, and show that relationship on chain. The amount of things that you can do with that, and the experiences that you can design around that – the possibilities around that are still so open, and yet there's still so much hype, or attention, given just to this “limited edition, scarce drop” model, or to this kind of “10k PFP” collection model. It's just very, very limiting.  I think as long as you lead with the fact that it's an NFT as the main selling point, your addressable market will have a ceiling. Because then you're speaking only to an audience of people who are much more Web 3 native, who have enough in their wallet, and who are wealthy enough to have some disposable income to spend on something like a music NFT where the value might not be as known. This is very similar to the dynamics of the visual or fine art market.  I think there is a market for Web 3-related music experiences, but ironically I think the word “NFT” will have to take a backseat as a leading indicator of why that project is valuable. If the goal is to reach a wider, more mainstream fan base, I think making the “why” or the “so what” or the resulting experience around that technology clear, to the point where the complexity of the technology takes a backseat – I think that is going to be crucial.  Do you find that there’s still a stigma around NFTs in the music world?  Definitely. Stigma around, financial accessibility, environmental concerns, for sure. And I guess it's a wider Web 3 thing, but there does seem to be a bit more momentum towards L2 chains in general.  I'm still trying to process this whole thing that happened with Yuga Labs over the weekend – I was not happy to not be trying to buy any NFT over the weekend, but the notion of gas fees going to several thousand dollars – in this music, cultural context, thinking about the already negative perception around the technology – definitely doesn’t help from an onboarding and adoption standpoint.  I think the messaging has to lead not with the technology, but the experience around it, and how the experience that the tech enables will be genuinely delightful and not complicated, and not lead to all these roadblocks that I think a lot of fans still run into.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Will Gottsegen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/05/cherie-hu-on-music-and-the-metaverse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5e85de7bdd9e62b5e19141d5e24e5f5cbdc7fcaa-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Funding Rates Surge Up,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin funding rates have observed a rise again, suggesting that another long squeeze may be in store for the crypto. Bitcoin Funding Rates Show Relatively High Positive Value As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQaunt post, the current positive funding rates may mean the price could observe a decline soon. The &apos;funding rate&apos; is an indicator that measures the periodic fee that Bitcoin futures traders are paying each other. When the value of this metric is greater than zero, it means long traders are paying a premium to short investors to hold on to their positions right now. This trend therefore suggests that the majority sentiment is bullish at the moment. On the other hand, negative values of the indicator imply that a bearish sentiment is more dominant as shorts are paying longs currently. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin funding rates (72-hour MA) in the year 2022 so far: Looks like the value of the metric has surged up recently | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the quant has marked the points where the Bitcoin funding rates reached a peak during the last few months.

42421606,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoiE9,1651777216,Crypto Is a Luxury Good,"About 20 minutes into his latest interview with Bloomberg, crypto’s favorite entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried said something revealing about the industry: Crypto is mostly a shell game.  “You know, where do you start? You start with a company that builds a box and in practice this box, they probably dress it up to look like a life-changing, you know, world-altering protocol that's gonna replace all the big banks in 38 days or whatever. Maybe for now actually ignore what it does or pretend it does literally nothing. It's just a box,” Bankman-Fried said.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Crypto, specifically “yield-farming,” or the generative process of turning tokens into more tokens, is filled with machines that print money, or grant voting rights over money printers or promise future returns through things like airdrops. You put a token into the “box,” you take some out, he said. And anyone can make their own box.  The exchange – prompted by a question from Bloomberg financial maven Matt Levine for a “sophisticated” explanation of yield-farming – went on for a bit longer. “Sophisticated investors” were mentioned, but the definition stayed pretty rudimentary. (“You're just like, well, I'm in the Ponzi business, and it's pretty good,” Levine said, summing up.)  Of course, crypto is more than just an empty box – it’s a fundamental rewriting of how economic activity could be routed away from centralized gatekeepers into community-owned structures. It touches anywhere that developers and entrepreneurs see “market inefficiency” or rent seeking. In theory.  But Bankman-Fried’s comments are not hollow. Crypto also is significantly wrapped up in branding, or the stories that people tell about it. Ask what Ethereum is for, and you might get hundreds of ideas about possible applications – from blockchain cities to banking the unbanked – but rarely an answer as self-contained or obvious as Bankman-Fried’s money-making machine.  There’s at least one potential theory about crypto that more people should spend time thinking about: Crypto is a luxury good. For all the long reads in Bitcoin Magazine about how people in developing countries are using BTC to protect or transfer their wealth, or similar stories about crypto dissidents or non-fungible tokens (NFTs) being used for charity, there’s hundreds of examples of crypto being used for self-promotion or personal enrichment.  Crypto is not a necessary tool for many people who use it but is often a way to signify a lifestyle or alignment with a certain movement or set of ideas. Crypto’s users are often conspicuous consumers – sometimes by nature of blockchains being public records – and often concerned more with using the right application or the right coin.  Lap of luxury  Last year I blogged about how “crypto is a luxury good, and Gucci hasn’t realized it yet.” Just today, the Italian luxury brand announced it will accept crypto in certain U.S. stores. Other highfalutin brands have also moved into the crypto world.  High-end watchmakers Hubolt, Franck Muller and Norqain, among others, are accepting crypto payments. As are travel agency Travala.com, carmaker Tesla and yacht retailer TJB Super Yachts. Luxury brand conglomerate LVMH, managers of the Louis Vuitton and Hennessy labels, is using blockchain to authenticate some of its products.  Other examples abound, some companies are building in the metaverse and minting branded NFTs. The play, though perhaps risky, is that crypto has made a lot of people very wealthy, and the crypto rich may be inclined to patronize businesses that affirm the industry.  Indeed, the chronicle of capitalism Bloomberg has reported a number of stories about crypto folk as high-powered buyers – in housing, in travel, in luxury services. Your money, even if fake internet money, is just as good.  But crypto isn’t just a means, but a luxury in itself. Pamela N. Danziger, author of “Putting the Luxe Back in Luxury” identifies 10 attributes that make a brand ""luxury."" Those can really be distilled to a sense of superiority or sophistication, rarity and pedigree and a shared delusion. These characteristics are not necessary to exist but are objects of desire.  See also: 'How Can Information Be Free but Expensive?': Holly Herndon  Market analysts sometimes refer to digital assets as Veblen goods, or items that see an increase in demand as their prices rise. This is about perceived value – and a form of it exists in crypto hype-cycles where more people are willing to buy a hot asset as it gets more expensive. Sure, there are other psychological and market factors at play, but data shows that there were more bitcoin buyers at its all-time high above $60,000 than today. (Some even say BTC is trading at a discount.)  The trouble with understanding luxury goods in the postmodern, postindustrial economy is that anything can suddenly become hip. Luxury is less about brand lineage or craftsmanship today than about identity and about aspirational signaling.  Experts say  Michael J. Silverstein, senior partner of the Boston Consulting Group (BCG), and Neil Fiske, CEO of Bath & Body Works, recently wrote about this trend in the Harvard Business Review, arguing that there’s a new type of luxury good that occupies “a sweet spot between mass and class” – these are items that exist between “super premium” but priced well-above the discount bin.  “[Consumers] seek goods that make positive statements about who they are and what they would like to be and that help them manage the stresses of everyday life,” they wrote. This “love affair” with “products” is largely “emotional.”  Luxury goods, they write, weasel into your brain and make promises they can “take care of you,” easing the burden of having too much work and too little time; “take you on a quest,” providing new experiences and fulfilling challenges; “connect you with others” while also practically helping you self-actualize “using the sophistication and currency of one’s consumer choices” to demonstrate success and express “individuality and personal values.”  “Spending on luxury goods is like burning money in public, to convince others that you really have a lot of money,” Wharton marketing professors Z. John Zhang and Pinar Yildirim said in a recent interview. Their new book, “A Theory of Minimalist Luxury,” also reexamines Veblen goods in the modern age, where more people have more money and counterfeit goods have gotten really good.  Bitcoin is a luxury good in the sense that its value is literally tied up in energy consumption. It provides a market and tool, but the burned energy really fundamentally signals that this thing, BTC, is desirable and valuable. Some studies have found knowledge or investment in crypto is sexually appealing as wealth always is.  The Wharton profs also mention how luxury brands today – facing counterfeits and a range of alternatives – must keep their brands “as clear and as undiluted to the consumer as possible.” Perhaps this speaks to bitcoin maximalists’ attempts to separate BTC from “[rhymes with pit] coins,” or any maximalist coin tribe disparaging a competitor chain.  See also: Time to Decide: Are You an Investor or a Gambler? | Opinion  Further, Zhang and Yildirim note how for many people the pandemic was an “opportunity to reevaluate our values.” Perhaps, for some, this moment of reevaluation of goods and society was a time to think about money itself – considering we were buying less and less.  This isn’t an all-inclusive theory – for as much as crypto is about signaling belonging or one’s wealth, it’s also a powerful tool for financial inclusion – just an attempt to open up the box and see what’s inside.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/05/05/crypto-is-a-luxury-good,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d5db83edcca7b77d760760fb522bde52d9c27e66-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420809,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYcIv,1651777057,Typo Moves $36M in Seized JUNO Tokens to Wrong Wallet,"The Cosmos-based Juno blockchain continues to serve as a case study for the trials and travails of on-chain governance.  An unprecedented community vote last week was supposed to seize millions of dollars’ worth of JUNO tokens from the wallet of a whale (large investor) accused of gaming a community airdrop. Rather than send the funds to an address controlled by the Juno community, as originally planned, a programming mix-up sent the funds to the wrong address on Wednesday.  Read more: Juno Blockchain Community Officially Votes to Revoke Whale’s Tokens  The promise of blockchain-based governance is that the will of a community is directly codified on-chain. In a world where “code is law,” a simple community vote should have been enough to move tokens from one specific blockchain address to another.  And yet, the failure of several human-controlled safeguards this week shows how code-centric governance has yet to live up to its heady promise.  Juno and the whale  Juno Proposal 20, which passed with overwhelming community support last week, revoked tokens from Takumi Asano, a Japanese investor accused of gaming the Juno airdrop to the tune of $120 million in February. It was the first major example to date of a blockchain community voting to alter the token balance of a single user accused of acting maliciously.  According to the community vote, Asano ran an exchange service that should have rendered his wallets ineligible for the so-called Juno “stakedrop,” which gave JUNO tokens to stakers on the Cosmos Hub blockchain.  After a delay of a few days, last week’s vote was supposed to automatically run code moving the “gamed” funds – now worth around $36 million – from Asano’s wallet into a “Unity” address controlled by the Juno community.  Things didn’t go as planned.  When the code was executed on Wednesday, a programming error ended up moving 3 million revoked JUNO tokens to an erroneous address on the blockchain where nobody – neither Asano nor the Juno community – has access.  Proposal 20: A copy pasta  Andrea Di Michele, a member of Juno’s “Core-1” founding developer team who goes by “Dimi,” told CoinDesk that the fudged transfer came as the result of a copy-paste error.  “When I gave the [Proposal 20] developers the address of the [Unity] smart contract, I pasted the address of the smart contract and just underneath put the transaction hash. But I didn’t write ‘the transaction hash is this,’ I just put the transaction hash,” Dimi explained.  According to Dimi, developers accidentally copied the transaction hash – which looked similar to the wallet address – rather than the address itself. As a result, the seized funds ended up moving to a crevice of the Juno blockchain where nobody has access.  Who is at fault?  Validators who deploy nodes to run proof-of-stake blockchains like Juno are theoretically responsible for conducting due diligence about on-chain upgrades like the one that came with Proposal 20. It is this disintermediated community of validators – not any specific developer – which is responsible for issuing blocks, securing the network and processing upgrades in a “decentralized” manner.  Of Juno’s more than 120 validators, not one appeared to notice that the Unity address was pasted incorrectly.  Daniel Hwang, head of protocols at stakefish, one of Juno’s validators, summed up his thoughts in a message to CoinDesk: “We f**ked up big time.”  Rather than the programmers who pasted the wrong address into the Proposal 20 code, Hwang said this week’s events were “more the fault of the validators” who ultimately executed that code.  “Devs can mess up … but at the end of the day there should be trust assumptions that cannot be relied on,” Hwang said. “Validators should have due diligenced for ourselves to actually check the code we’re executing and running.”  So what now for Juno?  The whale’s response? “LoL.”  Juno’s core developer team and the chain’s community are still intent on moving Asano’s funds into the community-controlled Unity contract rather than “burning” them unintentionally as Asano says might happen. (Asano previously told CoinDesk he will sue Juno’s validators should his funds get discarded rather than go to his supposed “investors.”)  As of now, the plan is to move the funds to the Unity address via an already planned upgrade to the blockchain. Instead of simply making code improvements, this upgrade will now rewrite Juno’s ledger so that the stranded funds are reassigned to Unity.  A vaguely worded governance proposal to green-light the upgrade, Proposal 21, includes lines that say the upgrade “[f]inalizes the Unity proposal fund transfer” and “[r]elocates the funds from a placeholder address to the Unity smart contract.”  Proposal 21 looks on track to pass, and it’s hard to imagine validators, developers and Asano won’t be triple-checking the code this time around.  Another bump in the road  While Juno has attracted significant support from the Cosmos blockchain community, this is just the latest in a series of setbacks for the project.  After a community vote first moved to revoke Asano’s tokens in March, a mysterious smart contract attack pulled the chain offline for several days in April. Over the past two months, the JUNO token price has declined from a high of around $40 to about $10, which is where it sits today.

42374758,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw2d11,1651774500,Curve Finance Integrates With Near’s Aurora Network,"Curve Finance, a decentralized exchange built on the Ethereum blockchain that focuses on stablecoin swapping, has integrated with Near protocol’s Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) layer called Aurora.  Aurora is an EVM built on the Near protocol, offering full Ethereum compatibility, low transaction costs and trustless bridging, according to its website. Aurora has $1.3 billion in total value locked (TVL) and is ranked 12th among top decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, according to DeFi Llama.  The integration allows users to connect to the Aurora network on their Ethereum wallets like MetaMask when using Curve and access the decentralized application's liquidity pools, according to the press release.  Near’s DeFi hub, Proximity Labs, will allocate up to $7.5 million in grants to Curve to help establish its presence in the Aurora ecosystem, according to a press release.  The merger comes at a time of increasing demand for Aurora, with DeFi protocols such as Aurigami, Bastion and Trisolaris all choosing the platform to build on. The deployment of market-leading bridge software is also notable; Multichain, Synapse and Wormhole have also integrated with Aurora.  “Curve’s industry standard stableswap function will add a layer of DeFi composability and liquidity to the Aurora DeFi ecosystem, and at the same time better position Aurora in an increasingly multi-chain world,” the press release said.  Curve Finance’s token CRV was down 5% to $2.34 in the last 24 hours amid a broad crypto market sell-off on Thursday.

The cryptocurrency may break below a series of higher price lows that has formed a trend since Jan. 24, which could yield further downside toward the $30,000-$32,000 support zone.  Still, a daily close above $37,500 could signal short-term stabilization. For now, upside appears to be limited despite intraday price swings, evidenced by slowing momentum on the daily, weekly and monthly charts.  BTC was recently trading at $36,800 and is down 6% over the past week.  The slope of the 100-day moving average has flattened over the past few months, which indicates weakness in the relief phase since the Jan. 24 price low near $32,900. Immediate resistance is seen at $40,000, which could limit buying activity over the short term.  Additionally, selling volume isn't as extreme compared with previous down moves in price. That suggests further downside is likely before sellers capitulate.  The 20-day moving average of BTC's trading volume based on Coinbase exchange data provided by TradingView declined from February to April, reflecting weak buying pressure within the $35,000-$46,000 price range.  The uptick in volume since late April, although negligible, should be monitored for signs of heightened selling pressure, which could signal a brief price low of around $30,000.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Damanick Dantes,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/05/bitcoin-dips-below-38k-support-at-30k-32k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ef9c47dc5e7e6e3def86bdc1b9244547c3346861-1876x698.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374767,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw2dB5,1651772782,"In Estonia, the Party’s Over for 'Hippie' Crypto Firms","A tough new crypto law is taking effect in Estonia later this year, but the prospect of 90% of crypto firms leaving the country is nothing to worry about, the official responsible for managing it told CoinDesk.  With a population smaller than Hawaii's, the tech-friendly nation is one of the EU’s smallest members – but with an outsize presence in the crypto scene.  Already the home country of digital unicorns like Wise, Bolt and Skype, last year Estonia could claim to host 55% of the world’s registered virtual asset providers, thanks to an advanced regulatory regime and a system that offered e-residency to entrepreneurs who’d never set foot in the country.  But that could change, thanks to a new licensing regime agreed by lawmakers in December.  “We will benefit from the new law,” Matis Mäeker, director of Estonia’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), told CoinDesk – but he also warned that the less professional outfits will need to shape up.  The legislation makes crypto firms, such as wallet providers and exchanges, keep hefty capital reserves, be properly governed and check customer identities. Though it took effect in March, existing companies have until mid-June to renew their authorization, for which they must submit business plans and financial data.  As of May 3, no company had yet sent in any new application and some have even sought to surrender their license, Mäeker said. (A spokesperson later clarified that there had been a couple of applications for changes, which are now being reviewed). Mäeker thinks some are finding the documentation requirements a struggle.  “Every IT system that is there should have an explanation: how it works, how it has been built,” he said. “For me, that’s self-explanatory.”  Perhaps not, though, for some of the more amateur operations run by “hippie-like” developers, he added – who he warned will need to professionalize and broaden their skills to keep up.  “We are telling market participants that it's not just a ‘dog and a man’ enterprise,” he said, adding that companies that perform functions like deposits and payments will need to manage risks just like banks do. “You need to have different experience and expertise as well, since you are protecting customers’ assets.”  His message to companies looking to register is simple: “start early and be prepared, because we are going to ask many, many questions,” he said. “This is not for us a tick-box exercise. It hasn't been for a long time now.”  Read more: Estonia Regulator Says No Plans to Ban Crypto  Some crypto companies feel that’s not just thoroughness, but a conspiracy against their sector.  “The industry feels like there was a lot of arbitrary treatment” when interacting with Estonian regulators, Jerome Dickinson, chief legal counsel at OSOM Finance, told CoinDesk in an interview.  “Regulators are often finding ways to delay or prolong licensing processes, or worse threaten to declare their managers or shareholders unfit and improper – not on the merits but simply because they are involved with crypto,” he added.  “Extremely high” registration application fees are “perceived by many in the industry as hostile towards the space, and a double standard” when compared to those applied to conventional banks, added Dickinson.  He also takes aim at the requirement for firms to appoint a dedicated compliance officer – something that appears to be motivated by a desire to put an end to a system where multiple companies share corporate services and even physical addresses, which is proving hard to comply with in practice.  OSOM, which according to the FinTech Belgium website offers a “safe and secure” crypto trading algorithm “generating 30%-50% proven annual return,” has Estonian founders, suggesting real ties to the country – but Dickinson reckons many other companies will simply abandon ship.  Of those with existing licenses, “the feedback we are getting in the industry is that only 50 will survive – maybe more, maybe less,” he said. “Most others will be wiped out or leave Estonia.”  That’s a significant drop from the 381 licensed as of the end of December. Consolidation could bring benefits, allowing the regulator to focus and supervise better, but could also concentrate the sector on the biggest players, such as large established banks, Dickinson warned.  Mäeker takes that kind of criticism in his stride. He denies the allegation that regulators see a career in crypto as automatically suspicious – but added budding executives can’t have a previous record of money laundering or hiding data from the government.  He said he doesn’t have a “target” number of companies he wants to stay in the country, but acknowledges the current figure will go down; it’s already done so slightly, and stood at 369 in early May.  In any case, he says a fall in numbers may not be a bad thing. “We want to have more control over the entities, which basically means that we want them to be more present in Estonia,” Mäeker said, with crypto companies bringing jobs to the country rather than simply outsourcing from behind a brass plate in Tallinn.  A January study by the FIU said many of the licensed crypto firms had no staff and paid no taxes in Estonia, and had little to show in terms of money-laundering checks and alerts, even when their turnover is hundreds of millions of euros.  Read more: Estonia’s New Anti-Money Laundering Chief Wants Stricter Rules for Crypto Licenses  Mäeker doesn’t share the conviction of many crypto investors that they’re all going to make it – but says that requirements on payment companies to have at least 250,000 euros ($265,000) in capital reserves offer a safety net if companies do start defaulting.  “There will be a crisis sooner or later,” he said, noting ballooning market prices – and once that happens, he said there will be a clamor for more regulation to protect investors.  You can see why he takes this seriously. The country recently found itself at the center of an international money-laundering scandal when it turned out Danske Bank’s Tallinn branch had processed around 200 billion euros in dirty money. The Ukrainian war and accompanying sanctions only heighten the risk of illicit Russian money pouring in.  A favorable review from the Council of Europe’s money laundering unit, Moneyval, could perhaps help draw a line under the Danske affair. As we spoke, Mäeker was in the middle of a two-week visit by Moneyval inspectors – and they are particularly concerned about crypto.  Positive  Other startups are rather more optimistic about the regime than Dickinson – seeing it as a way to strengthen Estonia’s position and credibility.  It’s a “really positive” legal framework that is “clear, specific and sustainable” – and something that could enable companies to operate across Europe with ease once a new EU-level law, the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA), kicks in, Bernardo Magnani, CEO at Estonian crypto banking startup Striga, told CoinDesk.  “The companies that stay will be reputable,” Magnani said, adding that new requirements were a reasonable way to weed out bad apples in the sector.  “If you told me to do business with a company that doesn’t have proper management with experience, and is unwilling to invest capital, that would raise red flags,” he said.  Mäeker, unsurprisingly, seems to agree that strong regulation could ultimately prove a bonus for the sector.  “The crypto market is here to stay in the global community, and I think that they want to have a proper supervisor that knows what it's doing,” Mäeker said. “The tougher the supervisor, the better for you to sell your services because you can say that we are supervised so heavily that there is no risk for the end customers.”  “This is a good place to start a business,” he said. “But beware: Money launderers, you don't have a place here in Estonia.”  UPDATE (May 6, 2022, 14:51 UTC): Clarifies Mäeker's comments regarding applications already received.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/05/05/in-estonia-the-partys-over-for-hippie-crypto-firms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/383764619fbbb6afe5aacbf82c7929a3994575ba-8660x5773.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

We wrote about it in our analysis and it was this mark that buyers kindly showed back in early March. It was during the weekly candle of 7 March that XMR frantic cryptocurrency growth impulse helped determine where the main forces of sellers for global trend change are concentrated. After an uncorrected growth wave for 6 weeks, sellers launched a counterattack after a $280 test. The final target of the correction is in the range of $180. XMR cryptocurrency is one of the strongest at the moment. The fact is that during the weakness of the Bitcoin price, XMR buyers have repeatedly managed to raise the price. https://www.tradingview.com/x/Ut94ZlKB/ Therefore, in our opinion, the XMR cryptocurrency should be in the medium-term portfolio of the investor.

Given the fact that buyers have not kept the global growth trend and still excludes the possibility of the historical high update within one wave of growth.

42420810,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYcJx,1651770469,Bankoff’s Crypto Wallets Nearly Empty After Virtual Debit Card Provider Folds,"Bankoff, a Delaware-registered company with operations in Azerbaijan, had been a way around harsh Western sanctions for ordinary Russians. No more.  The company provided virtual debit cards that could be topped up with USDT, a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin. (A virtual card is like a regular debit card, except it’s an app rather than a piece of plastic.) That allowed Russian citizens, cut off from the global financial system after Visa and Mastercard blackballed Russia, to keep buying things when traveling abroad.  Read more: Crypto Becomes Lifeline for Russian Emigrés Opposing Putin’s War in Ukraine  On Tuesday, Bankoff clients received emails saying that the service had ceased operations, blaming Visa and the Silicon Valley payments unicorn Stripe.  “Today we’ve received a letter from Visa and Stripe that Bankoff Card services have been suspended due to the high volume of active users and transactions from Russia. It means our cards are no longer supported for any offline and online payments,” the message said, adding that the company is “trying to access funds that have been frozen in our USA account.”  “​​Unbanked once again. What a life!” tweeted the pseudonymous crypto influencer Banteg on May 3, adding: “F**k Visa.”  However, some users expressed doubts about Bankoff’s story.  Users get suspicious  It’s not clear what U.S. bank Bankoff used, if any, or what kind of relationship it had with Stripe. Neither Bankoff nor Visa nor Stripe responded to CoinDesk’s request for comment by press time.  CoinDesk spoke to five people who said their money was stuck in Bankoff accounts – some said they successfully used the service before to pay for online subscriptions and even food in a brick-and-mortar store outside Russia.  “I paid for some services in Europe and Turkey and also for food via ApplePay in a grocery store abroad,” said Alexander Kotin, product manager at blockchain project Lachain who used Bankoff. Like many other users, he lost just a small amount of money, around $60, he said.  In the meantime, some posters on online forums have speculated the company could have simply absconded with users’ money. Bankoff never published the letters it allegedly received from Visa and Stripe and has given no further updates since May 3.  The service had been working fine before, several users told CoinDesk, and allowed them to send payments via virtual cards. However, in comments on Bankoff’s blog posts, users often complained about waiting many days before their deposits became available.  “Many believe that Bankoff was a scam. I think of myself as an advanced user, but I haven’t found any clear proof that they actually were a scam,” said Anton Jdanov, CEO of virtual reality startup 360MAX.  Jdanov told CoinDesk he tried to use his Bankoff account to receive a payment from a client in Canada. However, he never got the money – a little less than $1,000 left his client’s account but never landed in his own, he said.  Wallet action  From looking at block explorer sites, users noticed that Bankoff’s crypto wallets had been emptied before the shutdown. However, some said this is not a definitive sign of an exit scam because Bankoff, apparently, needed to cash out the USDT it got from users to put fiat money on their virtual cards. The company most likely did it via two major crypto exchanges: FTX and Binance.  Bankoff users provided CoinDesk with two addresses where they sent USDT, one on the Tron blockchain, the other on Binance Smart Chain (BSC).  According to Tronscan, an explorer site for the Tron network, the wallet users identified as belonging to Bankoff regularly sent USDT to several addresses. These appear to be deposit addresses, which exchanges assign to users to put crypto in their accounts for trading. Some of the addresses sent money exclusively to addresses marked on Tronscan as belonging to FTX (1, 2, 3, 4) and some to Binance (1, 2).  According to blockchain analytics service Bitquery, the Bankoff wallet received a cumulative $6.12 million in USDT on Tron since Bankoff was founded in August 2020. By Thursday, its balance had dwindled to $751.22, according to Tronscan.  The BSC address identified by users as Bankoff’s sent large sums of money to wallets that appear to be FTX deposit addresses (1, 2), according to a review of BscScan. According to Bitquery, around $2.47 million in USDT went through Bankoff's BSC wallet in total. The address held $699.50 worth of USDT on Thursday.  Stripe, Tron and Wells Fargo  Bankoff was founded in August 2020, according to Crunchbase, and gained popularity among users in Russia this spring, after President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine and Russia became subject to heavy international sanctions.  After Visa and Mastercard suspended operations in Russia, Russians living or traveling abroad struggled to find ways to buy goods and services, from software licenses and online services to airline and hotel bookings. Russian expatriates found themselves cut off from their own bank accounts in Russia.  Bankoff came to the rescue with its virtual debit cards. According to a March 3 post on Bankoff’s Facebook page, the company recently crossed the 10,000-user threshold.  To get a card, a user needed to sign up through a bot in Telegram, WhatsApp, Meta’s Facebook Messenger or Instagram. Then, Bankoff would issue a virtual debit card and let the user top it up by sending USDT to its address on the Tron or BSC blockchain.  The service also taught users how to use Binance’s peer-to-peer marketplace to buy USDT and how to send it to Bankoff's own wallet, said Andrey Vilchinsky, chief technology officer at marketing firm BrandLink. He used Bankoff to book a hotel; however, the payment never went through, so he had to pay with cash upon arrival, Vilchinsky told CoinDesk.  According to a Telegram group chat among Russian Bankoff users, Bankoff used a Wells Fargo account. One user posted a screenshot of banking details Bankoff provided for transfers with Wells Fargo’s information. The SWIFT code in the screenshot matches one for international transfers on Wells Fargo’s website. The bank did not respond to CoinDesk’s questions by press time.  It’s not clear how exactly this scheme worked or whether Bankoff possessed any licenses to provide such financial services. The company’s website provides no information regarding licensing. A legal entity named Bankoff Company was registered in Delaware in April 2021, and its street address matches the one on Bankoff's website.  The “About Us” page is now unavailable. Bankoff’s LinkedIn page lists 14 employees, all based in Azerbaijan, including founders Elmir Aliyev and Mahammad Oruc. Both also co-founded Botbox, an IT firm creating messenger bots. Aliev and Oruc did not respond to CoinDesk's messages by press time.  Sage D.

42374755,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw2cvz,1651768693,Bitcoin Plunges Most in 2 Months Amid Stock Market Sell-off,"Just one day after crypto and traditional markets soared on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s comment that the U.S. central bank wasn't likely to raise interest rates by more than 50 basis points (0.5 percentage point) at coming meetings, the dynamics of financial markets quickly changed.  Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market cap and the most affected by macroeconomic factors, dropped 7.3% Thursday to a 24-hour low of $36,640, according to data from TradingView. That was the lowest price since Feb. 24 and marked the biggest one-day decline since March 4.  “Yesterday's FOMC saw a rate hike alongside more concrete balance sheet contraction talk – things that don't bode well for markets,"" said Joe DiPasquale, CEO of BitBull Capital, a cryptocurrency fund of hedge funds. FOMC stands for the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed panel that sets monetary policy.  ""Even though there was an initial surge in BTC, it is not isolated from these macroeconomic changes, and today's price action reflects that,"" DiPasquale said.  ""The Nasdaq is down over 5% and central banks are adding value to fiat, especially the dollar,"" said Bob Iaccino, chief strategist at Path Trading Partners and co-portfolio manager at Stock Think Tank.  Bitcoin’s drop came as the S&P 500 skidded 3.8% and Nasdaq Composite Index lost 4.9%, reflecting the elevated correlation between the two indexes and bitcoin.  Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Market Intelligence, called Thursday’s market sell-off a “reality check” on CNBC, and Jason Deane, an analyst at Quantum Economics, said it is a ""text book capitulation"" after Powell on Wednesday shut down rumors that the Fed might raise interest rates by 75 basis points in one of its upcoming meetings. The comments sent stocks and crypto soaring in a relief rally.  But inflation at its fastest pace in four decades remains a nagging concern, and the Fed’s approach to tackle the issue is still hawkish at a time when doubts are growing whether the U.S. central bank can engineer a proverbial ""soft landing"" – cooling the economy just enough to ease inflationary pressures without causing an outright recession.  The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury pushed above 3%, its highest level since 2018, adding to the economic headwinds by increasing borrowing costs for everything from mortgages to corporate loans and commercial real estate.

With all the NFT innovations and applications in use out there, the world is still probably scratching the surface of possibilities out there. And the fun fact is that they&apos;re increasingly creating jobs as well as increasing users&apos; financial independence. While play-to-earn games featuring NFT market trades captured the minds of many a gamer out there, the industry could face its biggest competitor. And no, it isn&apos;t by the NFT arts or memes, which are quite vibrant spaces in their own right. The competition is from Picture-for-Proof(PFP) NFTs. What are PFP NFTs First things first, just what are Picture-for-Proof NFTs? As geeky as the initials PFP may sound, they aren&apos;t some intimidating tech or economical term. PFP simply stands for profile picture. So yes, there are profile picture NFTs available. They act as a form of digital artwork that people purchase and save as their profile pictures. They&apos;re more like a digital avatar that one uses to express their persona online. The Sense Behind Buying One Financial Independence The first reason is that one gets to enjoy full independence and control of their finances.

Valkyrie filed its application using the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, filing a 19b-4 form with the SEC. Most of the previously approved bitcoin futures ETFs filed by other companies were under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which follows a slightly different regulatory pathway to approval. Valkyrie is the second ETF to win approval with the older law, following Teucrium. Both companies also filed under the so-called “33 Act.”  The firm now offers investors the Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF), which mainly invests in bitcoin futures contracts. Additionally, the Valkyrie Bitcoin Trust (VBTC) is available only to accredited investors and invests in bitcoin.  In a filing dated Thursday, the SEC said it sees it as “unlikely that trading in the proposed ETP would be the predominant influence on prices in the CME bitcoin futures market.""  In the Teucrium order, the SEC said that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange bitcoin futures market has sufficiently developed to support exchange-traded products seeking exposure to bitcoin by holding CME bitcoin futures contracts.  Spot bitcoin ETF applications are uniformly filed under the “33 Act,” and have been dismissed without exception by the SEC as being too risky for investors for various reasons. The approval of what is now two 33 Act bitcoin futures ETFs will raise industry hopes that a spot bitcoin ETF approval isn’t far behind.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) joined the Labor Department in expressing concerns about Fidelity Investment's plan to offer bitcoin (BTC) in its 401(k) retirement plans.  In a joint letter with Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Warren asked Fidelity ""about the appropriateness"" of its plans.  Echoing the the Labor Department's concerns about bitcoin's volatility, the two described investing in crypto as ""a risky and speculative gamble.""  ""We are concerned that Fidelity would take these risks with millions of Americans' retirement savings,"" they said.  They asked Fidelity to say how it assesses risks of volatility, fraud, theft and the evolving regulatory environment and how it plans to address them.  Warren has previously expressed skepticism about the crypto industry. In March, she introduced a bill to block cryptocurrency firms from conducting business with sanctioned companies. There is broad consensus in the blockchain industry that crypto is not used to work around sanctions.  She has also questioned mining firms over their energy usage and is a proponent of the U.S. developing a central bank digital currency (CBDC), seen by some as a challenge and means of restricting private cryptocurrencies and stablecoins.

42435484,z5xashhl2ItpefZwyLxzhN,1651764806,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin's $40K Breakout Elusive as Fed-Inspired Dollar Drop Loses Steam,"Good morning, and welcome to First Mover. Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Dollar's recovery keeps bitcoin (BTC) under $40,000. While Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell downplayed prospects of a 75 basis point (0.75 percentage points) rate hike in coming months, the policymaker expressed willingness to tolerate a recession to bring down inflation.  And check out the CoinDesk TV show “First Mover,” hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern time.  Matt Hougan, chief investment officer, Bitwise  Mohak Agarwal, CEO, ClayStack  Nicole Buffett, art director  Joseph Kelly, CEO, Unchained Capital  Market Moves  Bitcoin bulls struggled to keep Wednesday's post-Fed recovery rally going, leaving the top cryptocurrency in stasis under $40,000.  The upward momentum stalled as the dollar bounced against major fiat currencies, trimming losses seen late Wednesday after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell downplayed prospects of a 75 basis point rate hike in coming months.  The dollar index (DXY), which tracks the greenback's value against major currencies, jumped 0.7% to 103.25, having dropped 0.9% to 102.51 Wednesday. The futures tied to the S&P 500, Wall Street's benchmark index, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq index traded at least 0.5% lower, signaling a weak open following Thursday's surge. Heading into the meeting, the Fed funds futures saw around a 40% chance of a 75 basis point hike in June. Therefore, risk assets picked up a bid after Powell dashed hopes of a bigger move.  Observers were unsure if the rally could continue, given the Fed has embarked on the steepest tightening cycle in decades. After March's 25 basis point hike, the central bank raised rates by 50 basis points yesterday and signaled similar outsize moves in the coming months. Further, the central bank announced quantitive tightening – the process of reducing the Fed balance sheet – which will start with an initial combined amount of $47.5 billion from June and reach the $95 billion level within three months.  The most hawkish statement came when a reporter asked Powell whether the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has the courage to endure recessions to bring inflation down if that were the only way necessary. Powell replied, ""we won't hesitate to do it.""  ""The hawkish Fed expectations may not let the bulls take the reins of the market,"" Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, wrote in a LinkedIn post while noting the post-Fed bounce in risk assets.  Brian Tehako, chief investment officer of Warwick Capital, said, ""Bitcoin could gather steam if the DXY breaks down from this [up] trend,"" adding that the Fed overall was hawkish.  The dollar index has bounced up from the former resistance-turned-support, indicating the path of least resistance is to the higher side.  The forward-looking U.S. inflation expectations surged following the Fed rate decision. So, the Fed officials could resort to more hawkish jawboning ahead of the June meeting, keeping gains in risk assets under check.  Lastly, monetary tightening is becoming a global phenomenon. The Reserve Bank of India raised rates by 40 basis points yesterday, while Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, UAE and Bahrain matched the Fed's 50 basis point hike early today. The Bank of England raised rates by 25 basis points to 1% soon before press time.  On-chain data paints bullish picture  The seven-day average of the number of coins last active at least a year ago has risen to a record high of 64% of total bitcoin in circulation, according to data provided by Glassnode.  That's a sign of strong holding sentiment in the market, according to Noelle Acheson, head of market insights at Genesis Global.  ""If BTC isn't moving, it's a long-term holding. At an all-time high. Definitely not nothin,"" Acheson tweeted.

42420804,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYcFp,1651764244,Everything You Always Wanted to Know About ‘Miladys’ but Were Afraid to Ask,"If you’ve spent any time on Crypto Twitter over the past few months, you may have noticed a strange new presence on your feed – an army of tiny, anime-inspired avatars, plastered across an array of fresh accounts.  You know these portraits when you see them: bug-eyed, uncannily lo-fi and rendered at the notorious three-quarter angle associated with so many “profile picture”-type non-fungible token (NFT) projects.  Yes, these are NFTs – a set of 10,000 generative icons unified by a single style – but they’re also something more: the start of a never-ending internet rabbit hole, an inscrutable ideological universe replete with high theory and “anti-woke” Substack newsletters.  This is the Milady Maker collection, an art project courtesy of a mysterious online collective called Remilia. Unlike your typical NFT project, Miladys (it keeps the “Y,” in the plural) exist in a world apart from the rest of Web 3.  You’ll find no “WAGMI” slogans here, no allusions to the distinctly pre-teen aesthetics of Bored Apes or Stoner Cats. Miladys are where the polytheistic religion of Vedism, kaomoji callsigns (a particularly DIY flavor of emoticons), rave culture, venture capital and the downtown New York podcast ecosystem intersect. They’re also involved with Urbit – an audacious project to rebuild the internet (and computing itself) from scratch – which, in its current form, mostly functions as a slower version of AOL Instant Messenger.  The point, as far as I can tell, is that nothing coheres; The anime egirl imagery and allusions to the accelerationist philosophy of writers like Nick Land feel like right-wing dog whistles, and yet the Remilia crew insist they’re beyond cancellation. It’s edgelords all the way down.  Here’s a deeper look at the Milady phenomenon.  What’s a Milady?  First and foremost, Miladys are NFTs, financial instruments with their own discrete value. The cheapest Miladys will cost you about $2,000 before fees, though they’ve historically sold for much more. Thanks to an online hype cycle, the average selling price for a Milady in mid-April was around $6,000.  That name, “Milady,” is a riff on “m’lady,” an expression of courtesy that has come to be associated with fedora-wearing gamers and faux-chivalrous “nice guys” in online forums.  The art for these 10,000 profile pictures was designed by a Remilia member called “Milady Sonora,” or “Milady Sonoro.” As with most of the people behind Miladys, they’re completely pseudonymous.  The mastermind behind the project (and the self-identified “CEO” of Remilia) appears to be “Charlotte Fang,” also known as Charlie or Charlemagne.  In an October essay titled “Milady Maker: Notes on the Design Process,” Fang outlines the schematic behind the traits assigned to each Milady. Miladys with rarer items (clothes, accessories, skin colors) are assigned a higher “drip score,” from “SS” tier down to “Normal.”  Some have criticized the decision to use “SS,” rather than just “S,” given the shared initials with the Nazi paramilitary organization, though Fang has denied any such connection. (Fang initially agreed to an interview with CoinDesk, but backed off.)  While the collection was launched last fall, it remained isolated from the broader crypto sphere until the spring, when Twitter-brained influencers and venture capitalists developed a fascination with the tokens. The rarest Milady in the SS tier sold for 15 ETH (around $45,000 at the time) in March, around the time that Miladys were starting to see a public resurgence.  The crypto venture capitalist Tom Schmidt, who currently rocks a Milady as his Twitter profile picture, told me he was attracted to the Milady aesthetic.  “I thought they were cool and cheap,” he said. “That's pretty much it.”  Of course, that’s not all there is to the project. Remiila faced backlash after the initial launch of the collection, once traders discovered a strange quirk in one of the Milady accessories: Some of the avatars in a spin-off collection (“Milady, That B.I.T.C.H.”) were wearing shirts bearing the word “Treblinka” – as in the Nazi concentration camp.  The group claimed the phrases on those shirts were assembled randomly, using text from a variety of sources. One of those sources, they said, was a newsletter from the pseudonymous blogger and critic Angelicism01, which likened the Milady movement to a “watercooler in Treblinka.”  Schmidt argued that even if Miladys are associated with some unsavory ideas, they can still be reclaimed by the community of investors.  “Pepe has followed a similar route from being sort of hardcore, borderline white supremacist, 4chan people into being this fun representation of internet culture,” he said, referring to the cartoon frog once ubiquitous on internet forums. “I think Miladys is going through a similar phenomenon, where it's almost being repurposed or recaptured from whatever it was associated with initially.”  Angelicism01, egirls, Nick Land and network spirituality  Understanding Miladys means grappling with its slogan: “I long for network spirituality,” a kind of mantra among Remilia acolytes and members of downtown New York City’s burgeoning alt-lit scene.  It connotes togetherness – maybe something like a singularity, or the cosmic unification of the Third Impact in the anime series Neon Genesis Evangelion – but it’s also, ultimately, gibberish, a cultural signifier more than a coherent statement of purpose. And in its refusal to actually mean anything at all, it’s more or less emblematic of the Milady vibe.  Though Remilia borrows heavily from Japanese streetwear culture, Milady Maker is a New York-centric phenomenon. The group has held three Milady Raves, all based in the city. I attended the first, at the tail end of last year’s NFT.NYC, and distinctly remember hearing Radiohead’s “Idioteque” over the speakers at some point during the night (cops shut everything down after an hour or so).  Milady Maker’s connection to New York also lends credence to the idea that its origins are, if not entirely grounded in edgelord, shock-value politics, at least somewhat reactionary. A recent Vanity Fair article traced the shape of the city’s “new right,” a scene more indebted to Nick Land and the right-wing blogger Curtis Yarvin than to the MAGA crowd. For these people, Catholicism is cool, family values are in and accepting money from Peter Thiel is a kind of aspiration. Angelicism01 and Land’s collected works (“Fanged Noumena”) are urtext; Barrett Avner’s Contain project, Honor Levy’s Wet Brain podcast, and the array of Instagram meme accounts ending in “-cellectuals” are sites of interpretation.  It’s no surprise that Miladys have taken hold among this crew; cypherpunk libertarians and crypto guys are sick of “woke culture” too. (Angelicism01 even sells NFTs of its own.)  But Remilia has been accused of more than just edginess and online trolling. Critics have drawn connections between Remilia and another, more explicitly bigoted online group: a defunct collective caled Kaliacc. It’s short for Kali Yuga Accelerationism, referring to the Vedic concept of the Yuga Cycle, which has sometimes cropped up among right-wing factions. The collective’s website still links to one of its old Twitter handles, “Ariosophy,” a nod to Nazi ideology.  Some have even claimed that the person behind the “Charlotte Fang” personality was also behind “Miya,” one of the two most prominent figures in Kaliacc. (Miya’s Twitter account has been long since banned, thanks to a string of virulently anti-gay, and anti-trans and white nationalist tweets.)  And although Remilia’s official Twitter account did make several explicit references to Miya, Charlotte Fang has pushed back against the allegation. Apparently trying to get ahead of the backlash, Fang wrote a piece last week called “Cancel Miya to me or I’ll f**king kill you,” in which he praised Kaliacc even as he attempted to distance himself from it:  “It is true Miya was an early example of the kind of collaborative, performative net art that interests us, and it is also true much of the content it produced was problematic. But who cares? It’s an artist’s duty to explore and critique the contemporary, even in all its ugliness, and if they determine that critique is best produced in a process of performative embodiment, so be it. You can expect more people and groups in this space to continue to engage with ‘problematic’ realities in ‘problematic’ ways. Good, it means art is back. Cancel culture is dead, disavowal doesn’t belong here.”  “He knows he got totally … caught and has to do damage control,” surmised one Twitter commentator.  Even if Charlotte Fang isn’t Miya, Milady Maker is practically begging you to be offended, to grasp for some coherent ideology among the almost-bigotry and recurrent dog whistles.  I don’t know whether I buy the defense that it’s all performance art, but it’s also clear to me that Miladys aren’t just one thing. In the way Miladys don’t stand for anything in and of themselves (most Milady owners probably don’t even know about Remilia), it’s difficult to assign a single ideology to a scene this multifarious and decentralized.  It comes down to what traders are willing to tolerate. For Tom Schmidt, the controversy is all water under the bridge. For investors like Dom Hofmann, the creator of Vine and prominent NFT artist, the calculus isn’t quite so simple. A few months ago, in the Friends with Benefits Discord server, Hofmann claimed to have bought a few Miladys himself; when he was informed about the project’s origins, he said he sold them.  It’s too early to tell whose lead the market might follow. For now, though, Miladys persist.

Blockchain Coinvestors has two other active funds. Fund III offers a “fund of funds” strategy, investing in top pure-play venture funds in the Americas, Asia and Europe. Fund IV is an early-stage token fund with direct access to private-stage token projects from a fund manager that has previously invested in Filecoin, Near and Polkadot, among others.

At issue, according to the SEC, is Canaan's use of an auditor for its 2021 annual report that the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) could not fully inspect or investigate, said the company in a filing. Said auditor was KPMG Huazhen LLP.  Finalized in 2021, the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (HFCAA) was aimed at removing from U.S. public markets those companies controlled by foreign governments.  Canaan has until May 25 to file documentation with the SEC to prove that it is not ""owned or controlled"" by a foreign government, according to the HFCAA. If Canaan were to remain as an ""identified"" issuer for three consecutive years, it risks being delisted from U.S. markets, including over-the-counter trading.  ""The Company will continue to comply with applicable laws and regulations in both China and the U.S., and strive to maintain its listing status on Nasdaq,"" Canaan's Thursday filing said.  The SEC and Canaan could not be reached for comment at the time of publication.  Canaan is one of over 70 companies so-identified yesterday, with other names including electric vehicle makers XPeng and Nio, e-commerce giants JD.com and Trip.com, and the maker of one of China's COVID-19 vaccines, Sinovac Biotech.

Paradigm and a16z raced to the top of the crypto venture capital leaderboard last year with a16z launching a then-record $2.2 billion fund in July, which was topped by Paradigm’s $2.5 billion vehicle announced in November.  LootRush offers a quick-start platform for blockchain games, which typically have a more complicated on-boarding process than traditional video games. The blockchain-agnostic platform also offers non-fungible token (NFT) rentals for game play, which cuts the cost for a new gamer and earns yield for the NFT owner.  Popular play-to-earn game Axie Infinity is the only game available to play on LootRush at this time. Users can create an account quickly with a username and password, select the playing program that best suits their needs and then pay a small entry fee and, if desired, the NFT rental fee using a payment card. The platform plans to roll out additional titles throughout the year, including CryptoKitties and NBA Top Shot.  The capital will be used to add staff globally and to buy NFTs at scale, LootRush CEO Anderson Ferminiano told CoinDesk during an interview.  LootRush’s genesis  “How we came up with the idea was that a friend of mine tried to play a crypto game last year, and it took him about three hours before he gave up even after spending $1,000 on NFTs,” Ferminiano said.  “Bringing a lot more gamers into the space and making it mainstream requires making the experience very easy and fast,” he continued.

Here is a step by step guide on how you can go down the rabbit hole and purchase a Rad Rabbits NFT. Step 1 - Setting Up a MetaMask Digital Wallet - (where your NFTs are stored) Here is where you can create your MetaMask wallet https://metamask.io. First download the chrome extension if you want to create a wallet on a desktop or download the mobile app if you want to create a wallet on your phone. You can create a wallet with a 12-word phrase or a 24 word phrase. It&apos;s important to note that this should be written down somewhere secure and never shared. The best practice is to write this 12-word phrase down on a piece of paper stored away safely. Do not keep this phrase on your mobile phone, for safety reasons. You can also secure the wallet login using face ID on your phone. Just an FYI, MetaMask users&apos; identities remain anonymous. Rad Rabbits NFTs cost a certain amount of the cryptocurrency Ethereum. Once you know which Rad Rabbit you want to purchase, connect your MetaMask wallet to OpenSea. Once the wallet is connected, you can select which Rad Rabbit you&apos;d like to add to your collection and press &apos;Buy Now&apos; and continue through the checkout process. You will need to account for gas fees - so make sure you have enough ETH in your wallet for gas fees.

Whether it is photos stored on mobile devices or the huge pools of data managed by tech firms, it is near-impossible to quantify the sheer amount of data that exists in the age of the internet. And all this data does not simply float in the air; it has to be stored somehow for security, record-keeping, and retrieval purposes. One of the most popular ways to store data these days is through cloud storage. Everyone from iPhone users to businesses keeps large amounts of valuable data on various cloud storage platforms and most of these tend to be centralized. The Problem With Centralized Cloud Storage On the surface, the use of cloud storage for these purposes would be the perfect solution to the issue of data management. Cloud storage means that those who need data storage do not need to spend money on physically storing their information via paper files and do not need to buy large and sophisticated computers to meet their needs. Instead, they merely need to pay a periodic fee to a cloud storage service that will ensure that their data is safe, secure, and organized. However, this system has proven to not be perfect and this is due to the fact that it is centralized. Centralization has always suffered from a peculiar flaw which is that a centralized body will become the target of attack and should it succumb, all those that rely on it will be affected.

The plans, now approaching finalization, could also toughen up the rules on overseas exchanges accessing the bloc and keep tighter tabs on the energy use of crypto mining, even if the risk of a bitcoin ban seems to have receded.  The document was prepared by France, whose government is responsible for chairing talks within the EU’s council. It is undated, but prepared ahead of a closed-doors meeting due to take place Friday morning European time. Governments and lawmakers need to thrash out their position before the rules, known as the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation, or MiCA, can pass into law.  While governments want to see NFTs entirely excluded from the new law, the European Parliament is worried about their use in laundering schemes and wants tougher rules.  That would mean “a NFT issuer would have to be a legal person"" rather than a decentralized entity and would also have to register with the authorities and comply with other consumer-protection measures set out in the law, the document said.  “This would therefore significantly broaden the scope of the MiCA regulation” beyond its existing focus on cryptocurrencies and into NFT assets from the world of art, entertainment and gaming, the document said.  Read more: EU's MiCA Bill to Enter Next Phase of Negotiations on Thursday  Lawmakers appear to have the support of the European Commission, which is responsible for brokering the remaining talks – and which also has concerns over the integrity of the NFT market, in which scams and frauds are becoming increasingly common.  The council also seems ready to concede to lawmakers’ tough position on limiting the energy emissions of crypto mining. The European Parliament no longer favors curbs on proof-of-work validation technology that some said could amount to a bitcoin (BTC) ban – but wants to see new coins setting out their environmental impact in regulatory documentation.  The document said France “would suggest to support” that call from the parliament, as long as it’s neutral in arbitrating between different technologies, such as proof- of-work. On Sunday, Mairead McGuinness, the EU’s financial-services commissioner, said a new global crypto agreement should consider environmental impacts.  DeFi  It may be better news for decentralized finance (DeFi). The European Parliament had controversially proposed to include decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) within the scope of the law – taking it into a field it was never intended to cover and raising questions about exactly which entity would be responsible for talking to regulators.  Lawmakers have now “expressed openness” to the softer position favored by governments, which merely want to see a further report on Web 3 innovations in one or two years’ time.  Governments could also take a tougher line on crypto sites from outside the bloc seeking to market to EU clients, the document revealed.  Under the law that applies to conventional finance, foreign firms can still offer investment services like brokerage to any European who proactively approaches them and asks – but those rules, known as reverse solicitation, are somewhat vague and inconsistently applied.  According to the document, the crypto sector has said that “insufficient regulation of reverse solicitation could lead to reducing the applicability of the MiCA regulation and paving the way to unfair competition.” It suggests governments think again about how to avoid any loopholes or divergence.  The news comes just after crypto exchange Binance confirmed it had secured regulatory approval in France – meaning it could be allowed to market across the EU once MiCA is finalized.

Partnering with Swiss cryptocurrency custody firm Metaco, the 162-year-old firm is helping institutions prep for worst-case scenarios.  “In the case of a catastrophic failure there’s a backup, which is typically in the form of certified, HSM [hardware security module] smart cards,” said Metaco Vice President of Strategic Alliances Seamus Donoghue in an interview.  Retail crypto holders with a hardware storage device like a Ledger Nano, for instance, will have something like a 24-word seed phrase to back it up.  But institutions investing billions on behalf of clients can have backup master keys fragmented and stored on multiple smartcards, which can be reconstituted and loaded into an HSM to recover the private keys.  This leads to a dilemma over what to do with these physical devices, Donoghue said, since investors want to avoid storing them at a central point of failure – which is where Brink’s comes in.  “Brink’s has custody locations around the globe and their specialty is secure logistics, handling banknotes for all the major financial institutions, precious metals and storage of those precious materials on behalf of institutions,” Donoghue said. “So it was a very natural fit for the physical backup of private keys to be stored in a distributed way across multiple vaults by Brink’s.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | WALLET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/05/bitcoin-brinks-storied-security-firm-protects-crypto-wallets-now,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1242d0bf232467a894006f0a3fafb2c8ffa7fc7b-4290x2873.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Gaming content specialist Holodeck Media has merged with Arslanian Media Group, the cryptocurrency and blockchain tech studio behind shows like “Crypto Capsule” and “The Future of Money.”  Holodeck Media – whose CEO Paul Dawalibi describes the service as “CNBC meets Barstool Sports, but for gaming in the metaverse” – is responsible for the rapidly growing “Business of Esports” podcast.  Former PwC crypto lead Henri Arslanian creates newsletter and content for some 500,000 followers each week. The various newsletters and podcasts will stay under their existing titles, all gathered under the merged Holodeck Media umbrella, Dawalibi explained. (The term “Holodeck” refers to the hologram-based 3D simulations that appear in the ""Star Trek"" universe.)  “We want to be the one-stop shop for all sorts of Web 3 industry content, talk shows and original IP,” said Dawalibi in an interview, adding:  “We think there are really three major themes. You have gaming, which I believe is at the core and where a lot of this is evolving from, and you have crypto, which is the core technology of blockchain powering a lot of this. And then you have metaverse, which is an extension of both of these things.”  Crypto media plays appear to be something of a theme lately. Earlier this week, news service Decrypt announced it has spun out from its parent company ConsenSys Mesh and raised $10 million, with a view to build out its Decrypt Studios arm, which brands non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and metaverse activations.  For Holodeck, the newly merged entity is aiming to roll out dozens more shows, Dawalibi said.  “We’re already testing internally broadcasting from within metaverses with virtual avatars and broadcasting to those metaverses with virtual avatars,” he said. “Also, from a token and NFT standpoint, we have a big announcement coming around how we distribute our content to the world.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/05/gaming-content-firm-holodeck-merges-with-crypto-specialist-arslanian-media,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e9942a55c9c2b2d6289d49c65faea7841d93f61f-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420801,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYcBh,1651755000,How the Crypto Industry Cultivates Trust,"The world is coming to trust cryptocurrencies in a significant, but uneven way, according to recently released research.  This is more than the victory of slick marketing operations and social media influencers, however. It represents the work of an important ecosystem of watchdogs and analysts in the crypto space and the industries surrounding it that are helping individuals and institutions separate the wheat from the chaff.  In a recent international survey by Bitstamp, one of the first major digital asset exchanges, 70% of more than 5,502 institutional investors said they were very likely to recommend cryptocurrencies, and 71% reported having a “high trust” in crypto as an investment.  “My perspective is that, in general, the media in this country portrays the trust for crypto as low, just based on everything I read and see,” Bitstamp CEO for the Americas Bobby Zagotta said. “This survey validates for me that the media are going after headlines more than accuracy when it comes to the crypto space, because the trust for crypto is actually amazingly high — in the upper 60s for retail and into the 70s for institutions.”  Read More: Bitstamp to Offer White-Label Version of Its Crypto Trading Services in US  Trust in crypto still lags traditional asset classes like real estate, with 82% of respondents indicating high trust, and stocks (80%), but high levels of trust in general suggest crypto has entered the mainstream.  The survey, which also included over 23,000 retail investors, found that the adoption of crypto is set to increase.  Crypto Exchange Vetting  In an era of cryptocurrency Super Bowl ads, it may be surprising that one of the bigger drivers of crypto adoption is operating mostly behind the scenes. Companies like Digital Asset Research (DAR) are vetting and rating crypto exchanges and adoption to clear the way for institutional investors to participate in the asset class.  “We realized that pricing data is a huge challenge. To get clean pricing data that’s reliable and good you can go to a single stock exchange and get the definitive price of a stock like Apple and know that it is the market price,” DAR CEO Doug Schwenk said. “In crypto you can’t do that. Exchanges pop up all the time, and who knows if they are reliable and good venues to do business in? In most cases they’re unlikely to be regulated at all.”  DAR recently released the results of its April 2022 Crypto Exchange Vetting, which analyzed 450 exchanges to certify just 21 exchanges as “vetted.”  The exchange vetting process combines quantitative and qualitative due diligence to find exchanges reporting accurate volumes and eliminate exchanges that are not appropriate for determining an accurate market price.  The recently implemented quantitative screening looks for suspicious trading patterns by sampling sets of consecutive trades and testing them for randomness – the process identifies exchanges that are inflating trading volumes.  Qualitative due diligence includes researching information about an exchange’s trade surveillance, enforcement, know-your-client and anti-money-laundering policies, business continuity plan and management team, Schwenk said.  Read More: Why You Should Curb Your Enthusiasm About the 'Crypto Bowl'  “We end up with a list of what we’ll call the most reliable venues in the space today,” he said.  Vetted exchanges on DAR’s report include Binance.US; bitbank; Bitfinex; bitFlyer; BITFRONT; Bitso; Bitstamp; Bittrex; CEX.IO; Coinbase Pro; Coincheck; CoinField; CrossTower, FTX.US, Gemini; itBit; Kraken; Liquid; LMAX Digital; Okcoin; and Zaif.  Is 21 ‘Vetted’ Firms a Lot?  So out of 450-plus crypto exchanges, only 21 were good enough to be “vetted?” That’s less than 5%!  “It says a couple of things: One is that there are incredibly low barriers to entry, almost anyone can set up an exchange, and also that the reported volumes in the crypto space are wildly overinflated,” Schwenk said. “That’s not just us, you can look at the Bitwise report put out about two years ago that said 95% of the activity in bitcoin is either fake or non-economic. Clearly, you have to be careful out there in the transacting space.”  DAR also keeps a watchlist of firms who are candidates to achieve vetted status, with 14 members: Binance; Bitkub; BKEX; BTCMarkets; CoinEx; CoinTiger; Dcoin; FTX; Gate.io; Huobi; KuCoin; LATOKEN; Phemex; and Poloniex.  Bitcoin.com recently fell off the watchlist.  “A lot of these venues were started by people who are not from financial industry backgrounds and who really didn’t know what to do to ensure compliance and quality,” Schwenk said. “Given the right feedback, a lot of them have pursued stronger operations, real compliance procedures, and started doing the things we’re asking for. We’re also trying to help the space mature.”  The vetting process informs indexes, both DAR’s own and those of third parties, particularly FTSE’s crypto industry indexes, as well as the FTSE DAR Reference Price, a “robust” hourly reference price for digital asset market performance.  Read More: Half the Professionals Surveyed in Anonymous Poll 'Trust' Crypto  DAR also vets digital assets – its last digital asset evaluation was completed in March and analyzed over 1,000 different digital assets across codebase construction and maintenance, community, security, liquidity and regulatory compliance factors.  “One thing we’ve seen over the past three to nine months is that these kinds of data quality and concerns about how do you know you have a price that is reliable have become increasingly more important as we’ve seen more regulation in this space,” said Schwenk. “Market participants are getting in who were not in the space historically. We think we’ve seen in the past six months some maturity happening in crypto that is a new wave, it’s an exciting time for us.”  Trust Travels  Stiil, Bitstamp’s survey finds that trust in developed countries like the U.S. lags the levels of trust for crypto found in developing countries.  “There’s less trust for the typical central bank and other institutions in the developing world, so they got to crypto first,” Zagotta said. “Our survey also showed that the more knowledgeable someone is about crypto, the greater their trust. That means that as people in the developed world learn more, their trust in crypto is going to increase, and so will their adoption.  “We can’t think just in terms of the next one million customers on our platform, we need to think about the next 10 million. That trust index is a leading indicator of continued strong adoption.”  Read More: Banks May Face Competition From CBDCs, Study Suggests",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Christopher Robbins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/05/how-the-crypto-industry-cultivates-trust,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8afafdd1779615d5958774ef0785d6b89fc70f5b-612x408.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421599,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoiB3,1651754369,DeFi: Building the Infrastructure for Future Economies,"The product lifecycle will inevitably necessitate design decisions that should not be made in a vacuum from the intended use case and users of the product. As such, it’s necessary for builders to identify a user and use case before embarking on the product development journey.  DeFi (decentralized finance) builders ultimately have to choose whether their technology is being designed to make existing economies more efficient or being designed to be the bedrock of new economies.  Kia Mosayeri is the product manager at Balancer Labs.  What is DeFi’s use case?  When you think about the “real-world use case” of DeFi, the idea often put forward is that DeFi’s efficiency could make it a replacement for the back-end systems of both fintech and traditional finance (TradFi). This is the DeFi mullet thesis.  DeFi is indeed well-positioned to be used by fintech and TradFi, although it is short-sighted to believe that this will be the only use case. It’s often the case that novel technologies are first applied to making existing economies more efficient, but go on to spur new economies that were not previously possible.  See also: ERC-4626: DeFi's Newest Money Lego  Besides being used as the back end for TradFi, DeFi will also give rise to ""net-new,"" Web 3-native economies that weren't conceivable in a pre-crypto world. I believe builders have to consciously choose between these two options, because during the product lifecycle, they will have to make design decisions that have different trade-offs for each of these use cases.  Old economies with new tech vs. new economies on top of new tech  When steam engines were invented, they were used for powering ships that were previously powered by the wind. That was a massive improvement on an existing construct – maritime transport. The steam engine was also used as a base layer to invent trains – that was a net-new construct. Maritime transport at scale was already possible with wind-powered ships and got a massive efficiency boost with steam engines. Land transport at the scale made possible by trains wasn't possible before trains paved the way for new economies in land-locked areas.  In the pre-internet era, if someone wanted to book flights and hotels, that person would need to go to a travel agency where an agent would book the trip by phone and fax. With the rise of the internet, travel agents replaced their fax machines and telephones with email. Eventually, travel websites like Expedia automated the agent away while maintaining the same workflow and the same supply and demand – this was an old economy using new technology. Airbnb came later and expanded the supply side to homeowners while extending the demand side by making new types of travel possible. Airbnb was a web-native construct and a net-new economy.  The internet has made mediums like newspapers, television and radio more accessible by leapfrogging the previously needed infrastructure. The internet also gave rise to new mediums like blogs, podcasts and community-created video content (e.g. YouTube). Radio and television over the internet are old economies that use new technologies, while blogs, podcasts and YouTube are new economies.  The internet made brick-and-mortar retail stores more efficient in ordering, forecasting and managing stock. Then the rise of e-commerce extended the supply and demand sides of the market.  The key trend that I’m pointing out is:  New technology is introduced: steam engine, the internet, DeFi.  Old economies and construct use the new technology for efficiency: steam-powered ships, Expedia, TradFi.  New constructs and economies are created that weren't possible before the introduction of the new technology: trains, Airbnb, e-commerce, podcasts, (insert net-new Web 3 native economy here).  Builders who built products to make old economies and constructs more efficient are not the same builders who built new constructs and economies.  Airbnb wasn't built by Expedia. Circa 2000, digital newspaper publishers didn't create blogging. DeFi-mullet-fintech won't give rise to net-new Web 3-native economies.  Builders will ultimately be faced with design choices that cannot cater to multiple use cases and users – builders will need to choose whether their technology is aimed to make existing economies efficient or to be the infrastructure for new economies. In order to build new constructs, builders have to envision net-new users and use cases in their product development lifecycle.  Design choices for net-new the Web 3-native economy  Building for a net-new, Web 3-native economy will be like assembling a permissionless DeFi infrastructure stack. The permissionless aspect of this stack isn't just specific to the users who interact with the protocols, but more importantly, for builders.  This infrastructure layer should be both horizontally permissionless for other DeFi builders who create adjacent protocols as well as vertically permissionless for users who build economic layers on top of this stack.  This trend is already seen with builders in DeFi who optimize to be a infrastructure layer for new constructs versus builders who optimize for allowing TradFi and fintech to capitalize on the efficiency offered by their protocols.  The first wave of money-market protocols optimized for creating unfractured lend/borrow markets for trusted and liquid assets by focusing on risk management of a single market.  The second wave of money-market protocols like Fuse are focusing on being an infrastructure layer, allowing anyone to permissionlessly create isolated markets. They separate risk management on these platforms from the infrastructure itself where market creators are responsible for adding collateral types and setting the borrow parameters. This makes Fuse a platform of plural money markets, each with unique assets and parameters.  See also: What Kickstarter Going Decentralized Means for Web 3 | Opinion  The first wave of automated market makers optimized for creating efficiency for conventional assets by creating efficient pool types for those assets. The second wave of AMMs, such as Balancer v2’s Vault, allows anyone to permissionlessly create an AMM with its own unique invariant on top of Balancer. This makes Balancer a platform of plural AMMs, each with its own unique math optimized for various asset types.  The first wave of fixed-income protocols focused on specific assets. The second wave of fixed-income protocols, such as Sense, are focusing on creating infrastructure that would allow anyone to permissionlessly create fixed income from any yield-bearing asset.  What are net-new, Web 3-native economies?  The short answer is that we don’t know yet. In retrospect, things like podcasts and Airbnb that when launched didn’t make much sense now seem inevitable. Today, these net-new economies of Web 3 might not be so vivid to most of us either.  Some trends in the zeitgeist that hint at how these new economies might look are Cloud Cities, the metaverse and GameFi.  The metaverse isn't a new term or idea. The term dates back to Neal Stephenson’s novel “Snow Crash,” which was published in 1992, and the idea is much older. Given social media, massively multiplayer online (MMO) games, virtual reality/augmented reality, this concept has been on the rise for some time, but the usage of the term itself took on a new life recently as the economical implications of this concept became more vivid to the zeitgeist after the NFTs (non-fungible tokens) and DeFi gained prominence.  See also: Web 3 and the Metaverse Are Not the Same  GameFi is perhaps a more concrete example. Historically, games have attracted players through story/narrative, gameplay mechanics and visuals/graphics. Games like Axie Infinity introduced a fourth dimension: in-game economies. Game developers use templates, modifiable frameworks and redeployable infrastructure wherever possible to produce the former three dimensions. If game makers were to add economical layers to their games, it’s likely that they would succeed if they had access to a redeployable DeFi infrastructure. Cloud Cities and GameFi highlight the infeasibility of monolithic DeFi markets where the governance of the markets are tied to the same apparatus that governs the protocol.  The old way is to be consumed with governance lobbying or rebuilding the wheel by spending developer resources on DeFi integrations – this won't scale for beyond the financial bedrock of new economies. The new way is to make a single integration into the DeFi stack, allowing projects to lean into their own core competencies and focus on building the product/service that people want.  DeFi builders will need to decide if they want to create the layer that gives rise to these new economies or if they want to build technology that serves the efficiency issues of old economies.",NEUTRAL,없음,AXS | BAL | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Kia Mosayeri,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/05/05/defi-building-the-infrastructure-for-future-economies,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dfc819a327e00ac4947eb969ce9529bfbd3d4815-2048x1278.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42435482,z5xashhl2ItpefZwyLxzft,1651750854,"Dogecoin, Shiba Inu Underperform Broader Crypto Market Despite Fundamental Growth","The tokens of dogecoin (DOGE) and shiba inu (SHIB) rose by an average of 3.5% in the past 24 hours even as the broader market added over 5%, data from CoinGecko shows.  The relative underperformance came even as both ecosystems saw fundamental growth in their underlying communities. DOGE was used to fund the purchase of a controlling stake in BIG3 league basketball team Aliens and shiba inu developers started allowing community members to use SHIB for minting virtual land on shiba inu’s recently launched metaverse.  Bill Lee, a tech investor and founder of dogecoin wallet MyDoge, purchased non-fungible tokens (NFTs) offered by the Aliens exclusively for DOGE, giving him a controlling stake in the team. MyDoge branding will feature on Aliens team jerseys, events and BIG3 broadcasts as part of the purchase.  For Shiba Inu, SHIB joins ether (ETH), previously the only payment method available. Last month, Shiba Inu developers also launched a burn portal, which allows users to permanently destroy their tokens in return for yields.  Still, the changes failed to move prices of the two tokens even as total market cap for cryptocurrencies added 5%. At the time of writing, SHIB was changing hands at $0.00002148, a 3.55% rise over the past 24 hours, and DOGE rose 3.28% to $0.1344 – displaying sluggish growth for tokens that are known to be extremely volatile.  Musk’s tweets  Some analysts said price changes in the tokens are partly attributable to tweets by Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, a factor that investors have increasingly become wary about.  The change in SHIB is ""a far cry from the moves it makes when responding to Elon Musk’s tweets,” said Egor Volotkovich, director of EVODeFi, a cross-chain product. “This trend has shown that both shiba inu, dogecoin and other meme coins rely heavily on Musk’s unpredictable publicity to return good growth to their investors.”  Other market observers echoed the sentiment: “There is a very high dependence of both cryptocurrencies on Elon Musk’s tweets over time,” Fuad Fatullaev, CEO of NFT platform WeWay, said in a Telegram chat.  Fatullaev, however, said Shiba’s metaverse could see growth in the coming days. “We can expect the metaverse project to serve as a means for Shiba Inu to begin charting its own organic growth. And with the new utility it is bringing to the table, it may be compared to Yuga Lab’s Otherside metaverse.”  Musk has previously lent support to dogecoin adoption and development, and his tweets have regularly, if temporarily, caused a surge in DOGE prices. Tesla already accepts DOGE as a payment option in its merchandise store, and Musk teased DOGE payments on Twitter (TWTR) last month as well, days before agreeing to purchase the social media giant.  ApeCoin effect?  Meanwhile, some traders said ApeCoin’s (APE) recent rise could allow it to be seen as one of the top risk-on assets alongside DOGE and SHIB.  ""There has been some talk in crypto networks of APE filling in as the proxy risk-on asset replacing DOGE and SHIB,” said Kurt Grumelart, a trader at Sydney-based crypto fund Zerocap. “While this has had little time to prove itself, APE could fulfill the role and becomes the chosen meme token in the crypto community, particularly as Yuga continues to increase its cultural influence.""  APE, and its futures, are among the most traded cryptocurrencies in the past week amid the highly-anticipated launch of Otherside, a metaverse for the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) ecosystem. APE is the governance token of BAYC and can be used to purchase virtual land in the Otherside metaverse.  The market activity of meme coins, however, could showcase how their investors generally approach such assets.  ""Meme coin investors [very generally speaking] are primarily focused on catching the next 1,000x, drawing capital away from established tokens such as these,” Grumelart said, explaining the underperformance of DOGE and SHIB.",NEUTRAL,DOGE | SHIB | APE,BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | SHIB | APE,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/05/dogecoin-shiba-inu-underperform-broader-crypto-market-despite-fundamental-growth,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dd8810878dc04aa2277a04298788f2cc47eb6ab2-2124x1411.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Around $7.1 billion has been committed by 19 different parties with Fidelity putting aside $316 million for the takeover  Musk, who founded electric car maker Tesla (TSLA), has agreed to buy Twitter and had said that he wants the platform to be a proponent for free speech. The billionaire is also a known supporter of cryptocurrencies, like dogecoin (DOGE) and bitcoin (BTC).  According to an updated Schedule 13D filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday, the world's largest crypto exchange was among the equity investors for the deal. A Schedule 13D is a form that must be submitted to the SEC when an entity acquires more than 5% of a company's equity.  Binance founder Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao referred to the commitment as ""a small contribution to the cause"" in a tweet after the news emerged. Following Musk's initial offer to buy Twitter last month, Zhao tweeted that Musk should ""Privatize it, issue a token, decentralize it,"" adding that a priority should be to reduce spam and scams on the platform.  A Binance spokesperson told CoinDesk that the exchange's involvement is ""as a supporter of Elon Musk's plans for Twitter and an investor.""  Musk's takeover has also been endorsed by Twitter founder Jack Dorsey.     Shares of Twitter were up over 2% to $50.12, while shares of Tesla were down 0.6% to $946.98 in premarket trading.  Binance coin (BNB) jumped from $399 to $414 following news of Binance's commitment, before settling at about $407 at the time of writing.

The European Central Bank (ECB) has released a presentation addressing this topic, stating that the Eurosystem should only have access to the bare minimum of transaction data. User anonymity is not the desired design option. Three Alternatives to Privacy In response to EU citizens&apos; concerns about the privacy implications of a CBDC, the ECB&apos;s presentation presents three distinct privacy solutions for the digital currency that can be implemented. To begin with, the existing baseline scenario, which is identical to digital transactions through private banks, allows digital euro intermediaries such as banks to access transaction data while the ECB does not. According to the presentation, transparency is necessary for &apos;anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML &amp; CFT).&apos; The other possibilities have been branded as the &apos;preferred&apos; course for the bank&apos;s digital money. For low-value/low-risk payments, one might allow for more anonymity, implying &apos;simplified checks&apos; on the transactions. On the other hand, high-value prices will be subject to routine restrictions. The text did not define what income level qualified for this type of payout.

The recovery follows a jump in the broader markets after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised rates on Wednesday.  The overall crypto market added capitalization of 4.9%, almost reaching the level in early April of $2 trillion. Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) were up 5%, nearing pivotal resistance levels of $40,000 and $3,000 respectively.  Liquidations on crypto-tracked futures remained relatively low, despite the move. The market saw $177 million in liquidation losses in the past 24 hours, suggesting the rally was mostly driven by spot assets.  ADA spiked as much as 14% during early Asian trading hours before dropping slightly to the $0.86 level. The driving factor for the token was demand from retail traders, as on-chain data shows a 186% rise in the number of wallets holding ADA for 30 days or longer.  SOL jumped 9% to just over $93, while Avalanche’s AVAX jumped as much as 12%. Other majors like BNB Chain’s BNB and XRP rose just over 5%, mimicking bitcoin’s move.  SOL was partly buoyed by fundamental improvements to the Solana Pay product. Developers added a transaction request feature that would now allow merchants to provide customized transaction links to users, such as unique non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or virtual gifts.  Previously, Solana Pay allowed only one-way transfers between users and merchants, as reported on Thursday.  U.S. markets recover after Fed hikes rates  The moves came amid a broader market recovery in the U.S., which likely served as a bullish sign for investors. The Fed raised interest rates by 50 basis points, and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said similar moves can be expected in June and July.  Powell addressed growing concerns around surging inflation in a meeting on Wednesday, stating the Fed would move “expeditiously to bring it back down.” Powell added the move could cause “some pain” in the economy as it took steps to deal with inflation.  The Fed’s confidence in tackling a slowing economy led to a moves up in financial markets: Equity markets in the U.S. jumped, with technology-heavy Nasdaq ending the day 3.19% higher and S&P 500 gaining 2.99%.  Some traders and developers said the economic decisions in the U.S. fueled Wednesday night's rally in cryptocurrencies, but the sentiment for longer-term recovery remains mixed.  ""Going into the meeting we have seen risk-off action across the board in global markets, crypto inclusive. The 50 bps (basis point) rate hike was the most likely outcome of the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting and the narrative has shifted to the Fed being in control and no longer behind the yield curve,"" Kurt Grumelart, a trader at crypto fund Zerocap, said in a Telegram message.  Johnny Lyu, CEO of crypto exchange KuCoin, said in a Telegram chat that market participants expected volatility ahead of Wednesday's Fed announcement. ""The focus of the market was the announcement of the final decision of the FOMC to raise the benchmark interest rate by 50 points to the range of 0.75%-1.00%. This was the largest rate hike since May 2000,"" he said.  ""We can see that Powell ruled out a 75 basis point rate hike and expressed confidence that the U.S. could avoid a recession, a so-called hard landing, as the Fed raises borrowing costs to reduce high inflation,"" Lyu explained, adding Wednesday's bounce in cryptocurrencies showed that despite the macroeconomic pressures, the cryptocurrency market remained ""surprisingly strong in relative terms.""  Anton Gulin, a regional director at crypto exchange AAX, said much of the moves came from an underlying correlation between U.S. equities and the global crypto market.  ""The expectations were worse than the actual outcome, therefore we can see recovery across all markets. The correlation between crypto and stock markets has always been quite manipulative,"" Gulin said. ""The following month is gonna be the interesting cause as we know: ""Sell in May and go away"".""  Some like Zerocap's Grumelart remain wary about that correlation. ""While we don't explicitly expect more downside (particularly because we are near a long-lasting support base), you can't look past current headwinds and high correlation to traditional markets,"" he said.",NEUTRAL,ADA | AVAX | BTC,ADA | AVAX | BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/05/cardano-avalanche-lead-fed-driven-crypto-rally-traders-still-wary-of-long-term-recovery,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/15b525d4906cd3018bb84ab6a21f187bd90e4734-4256x2836.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Developers added the transaction request feature to allow merchants to provide customized transaction links to users, such as unique non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or virtual gifts.  The merchant receives the wallet address in the request and can respond with a customized transaction for the customer. This means any Solana transaction would allow interactive requests between a checkout app and a mobile wallet.  “Merchants and brands can create dynamic experiences that send tokens, invitations and gifts to customers,” the post reads. They could range from the minting of unique NFTs, customized discounts and tokenized loyalty programs.  Merchants can decline to respond to a transaction request, which could be used to allow permissioned payments, such as in cases where authentication is required.  The Pay product previously allowed only one-way transfers between users, such as those of Solana’s SOL, USD Coin (USDC), NFTs and other supported tokens.

The market has seen a large outflow of institutional cash in recent weeks, according to multiple sources. Coinshares made the figure surrounding the conversation available a few days ago in a recent update. Investors Leave Market According to Coinshares&apos; latest figures, the total amount of money that has flown out of the market owing to institutional investor withdrawals in a month is over $339 million. Despite the fact that the market saw a similar movement at the start of the year, the study indicated that this one had not overturned it. The sum was roughly $467 million at the start of the year, according to Coinshares, indicating a $128 million difference. According to the report, Bitcoin funds accounted for the majority of the recorded withdrawals. Since a whopping $133 million was seen in June last year, this figure reflects the greatest outflows from the Bitcoin fund in a week. According to the paper, pinpointing the exact root of the problem is difficult. However, much has been said about the market&apos;s drop, while others have speculated on the US Federal Reserve&apos;s report. BTC/USD trades at $39k.

A break above $88 may be the foundation of a leg up lifting LUNA towards $100 in a bull revival. Past Performance of LUNA LUNA prices are stable when writing, adding two percent in the past trading week. Overall, the coin is in red versus the USDT, but buyers are keen on unwinding last week&apos;s sharp losses. The immediate support line is at $75. On the reverse side, resistance is at the middle BB, flashing with $88 and April 30 high. Terra Technical Analysis Sellers remain in control as per the LUNAUSDT technical arrangement in the daily chart. Notable, Terra prices are inside the April 30 bear bar. From an effort versus result perspective, this is bearish. Even so, a close above the middle BB and $88 may lift the coin towards $100, confirming gains of May 1. On the reverse side, losses below last week&apos;s low at the back of rising volumes may force the coin to $60. This support level is the 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement level of the Q1 2022 trade range. What to Expect from LUNA? There are hints of strength from the Terra price action.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $39,600, up over 5%. Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was changing hands over $2,930, a 6% gain. Other major cryptos were even more in the green, with ADA and AVAX rising over 16% and 11% respectively, and SOL jumping 8%.  Crypto's upswing, which broke nearly a week of declines, followed the U.S. central bank's long-awaited half-point interest rate hike, the most significant step so far this year in its quest to tame rising inflation. The U.S. Federal Reserve also said that it would reduce its $9 trillion asset portfolio of mortgages and Treasury securities. Other central banks have also raised rates in recent months, although not as aggressively.  Investors have been fearful that the Fed's newfound hawkishness would send the economy into recession. The rate increase was the largest since the bank raised it by a half-point in 2000.  Growth has already slowed over the first part of the year. U.S. gross domestic product declined 1.4% on an annualized basis during the first quarter. But in remarks Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the Fed could reduce the monetary stimulus that fueled the country's strong growth last year while ensuring the sort of soft economic landing that would comfort investors. Powell described the economy as strong, a point underscored by recent, strong employment numbers, and ruled out larger rate increases, all of which buoyed equity markets.  The tech-heavy Nasdaq rose over 3% and the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped nearly as much.  Despite Wednesday's spike, bitcoin has spent 2022 in the doldrums, falling 17% in April alone. May, a historically strong month for crypto, had shown little pep till now as investors continued digesting a toxic combination of sinking economic indicators and global uncertainty, largely fueled by Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.  Dan Young, head of partnerships at blockchain analytics firm Elementus, noted ongoing concerns about inflation; disappointing rates of crypto adoption, particularly in El Salvador, which made bitcoin legal tender last year; ""high-profile protocol breaches that have highlighted vulnerabilities and increased regulatory scrutiny of miners."" Yet, Young said that ""the space has shown to be incredibly resilient.""  ""This resilience is what keeps crypto surging back, as we saw today with the (then) 6% spike,"" he said, adding, ""This remains an incredibly volatile emerging asset class, where conventional notions around market sentiments are continually turned upside down. So long as crypto remains resilient in the face of hacks, monetary policy and political tailwinds, it will continue to roar back life, especially given the billions of institutional capital.""  Insights  Asian headwinds for bitcoin  Over the past two months, crypto investors have been focusing on central banks' interest rate hikes and the economic fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, ratcheting back their commitment to crypto and sending prices spiraling.  But recent events in Asia and other parts of the world have also weighed on markets. They offer the latest evidence that crypto is a complex organism, global by nature and subject to the same issues and events that affect other assets. Crypto, despite the contentions of its most passionate advocates, does not operate in a bubble.  Consider events from the past week in the Asia-Pacific Rim region, which have helped keep bitcoin range-bound with support at $37,000 and resistance just under $40,000. Cryptos’ desultory performance has tracked similarly range-bound pricing in Asia’s major equity markets.  The sluggishness of these assets has come amid continued draconian coronavirus-related lockdowns by the Chinese government that have hurt growth, and a record April heatwave in India that could hinder that country’s vital agricultural exports.  Meanwhile, India’s tax department is trying to raise more money from the country’s burgeoning number of crypto investors, according to a recent report by the Economic Times. Citing two unnamed sources, the business publication said the agency could take up to 20% in taxes deducted at source (TDS) on interest earned by Indian residents on foreign platforms.  TDS is income tax on money paid at the time of a transaction, and also applies to the entities making such payments. The TDS on crypto transactions is currently 1% and is part of a new crypto tax law that goes into effect July 1.  A finance bill in April introduced a 30% tax on returns or profits made by Indians from cryptocurrency investments. Trading volumes on the country’s exchanges have since nosedived some 70% in the past month.  Additional taxes on passive investments could cause a further exodus of capital from exchanges. Some Indian entrepreneurs, such as the two founders of crypto exchange WazirX, have already moved with their families to Dubai, possibly due to its friendlier crypto regulations.  The company will maintain its official headquarters in Mumbai, but WazirX said in a statement that it wanted to give “all the company employees the option to work from anywhere, subject to their comfort and convenience unless they are required to travel officially.”  Technician's take  Bitcoin Downtrend Stabilizes, Resistance at $40K-$43K  Bitcoin (BTC) reversed a short-term downtrend on intraday charts, albeit within a three-month trading range. Choppy price action could occur into the Asia trading day as buyers try to defend support at $37,500 ahead of sell orders near the $40,000-$43,000 resistance zone.  Still, upside appears to be limited despite the potential for intraday price swings. For example, there has been a loss of upside momentum on the weekly chart, similar to what occurred in November, which preceded a price drop.  This time, however, the weekly chart isn't overbought. That means BTC's current price range could persist until a decisive breakout above $46,000 or breakdown below $30,000 occurs.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is hovering near oversold levels, which could keep short-term buyers active, especially if momentum signals improve.
