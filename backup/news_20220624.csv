42394527,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwAVaX,1656106045,How Are Institutions and Companies Investing in Crypto?,"For years, the idea that traditional finance institutions would invest in bitcoin (BTC) was laughable. But as of mid-2020, the institutional presence in the cryptocurrency became a reality. Many cite the foray of “the suits” into crypto as a contributing factor to the latest bull run that began in late 2020 and ended in late 2021.  Institutional interest in the cryptocurrency market excites current investors because institutions bring in fresh money, and certainly more money than retail can pour in.  Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is the gateway – and indeed the only stop – for many institutions that ventured into the cryptocurrency market. As of June 2022, 6.47% of all bitcoin that will ever exist is held by institutions, a broad category that includes ETFs like VanEck in Canada and sovereign governments like El Salvador.  Although bitcoin is often the first and the final step for major institutions, experimental institutions have recently stepped into other parts of the crypto industry. NFTs and the metaverse are two intertwined sectors in which institutions actively invest – rather than just passively investing in a cryptocurrency like bitcoin.  Bitcoin  The most straightforward way of investing in crypto for institutions is to hold cryptocurrency on their balance sheets.  The institutional presence in crypto began in earnest when MicroStrategy, helmed by Bitcoin maximalist Michael Saylor, bought $250 million worth of bitcoin in August 2020, followed by an additional $175 million in bitcoin one month later. MicroStrategy’s big step was followed by payments processor Square’s $50 million BTC purchase in October 2021 and EV manufacturer Tesla’s $1.5 billion BTC in February 2021.  The first mover continues to be the biggest holder. MicroStrategy owns 129,218 BTC in its stashes, accounting for 0.615% of the 21 million bitcoin that will ever exist. Tesla comes in second with 42,902 BTC, or 0.204% of all the possible Bitcoin supply.  Institutional activity in crypto is a double-edged sword. In May 2021, Tesla reversed its decision to accept payments in bitcoin over environmental concerns after less than two months of trialing the cryptocurrency as a payment method for its cars. This about-face contributed to a large sell-off in the cryptocurrency market.  Bitcoin mining companies or groups, which receive bitcoin rewards for validating transactions on the network, are another category of institutions holding the largest cryptocurrency.  There are also indirect ways institutions invest in bitcoin. Exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, are the most common indirect form of investment. Although there are bitcoin spot ETFs in Canada and Europe, the financial instrument isn’t approved in the US. Instead, there are ETF-like instruments, like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, a closed-end trust that tracks the value of Bitcoin. (Grayscale Investments, which manages the trust, is a unit of Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.) It had $18.5 billion worth of assets under management (AUM) as of June 2022.  See also: Bitcoin ETFs: Everything You Need to Know  Another alternative to bitcoin spot ETFs comes in the form of Bitcoin futures ETFs, which invest in bitcoin futures contracts. ProShares’ Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), and several others, were approved in late 2021 by the SEC, ratcheting up the price to new highs.  Bitcoin as part of a retirement strategy is another recent development. In April 2022, Fidelity Investments, the largest 401(k) provider in the United States, began offering exposure to Bitcoin through its 401(k) plans. If employers approve, Americans could invest in the cryptocurrency through their retirement savings.  Read More: What You Need to Know About 401(k) Accounts With Bitcoin  DeFi  Decentralized finance is a corner of the crypto industry with billions of dollars locked into smart contracts. Smart contracts are self-executing pieces of code that enforce contractual agreements between parties. DeFi runs on smart contracts that power decentralized apps (dApps), which offer a range of financial services such as:  Loans  Insurance  Interest-bearing accounts  Although on the surface, DeFi looks like the opposite of traditional finance, both industries have overlapping interests; there have been innovative collaborations recently.  Some DeFi platforms actively try to lure institutional investors. DeFi lending protocol Compound set up in June 2021 an institutional gateway called Compound Treasury. S&P Global Ratings, a credit rating agency for traditional finance institutions, awarded Compound Treasury with a B- grade, which means the USDC-powered yield platform ranks as ""speculative"" but ""currently has the capacity to meet financial commitments.”  Instead of waiting for the institutional alternative to set up shop, some institutions go directly to DeFi protocols.  In October 2021, French investment bank giant Société Générale (SocGen) submitted an application on MakerDAO’s governance forum for the lending platform to accept its on-chain digital covered bonds, OFH Tokens. These tokens were issued by the bank as collateral for a $42 million loan in stablecoin DAI. As of June 2022, the negotiations over technical details continue.  Central banks are also exploring DeFi. In May 2022, Singapore’s central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), launched Project Guardian, a pilot program in partnership with DBS Bank, JPMorgan and Marketnode to explore use cases of digital assets in tokenization and decentralized finance (DeFi). In the first step of the project, the bank will create a liquidity pool of tokenized bonds and deposits for borrowing and lending purposes.  Speaking at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2022 conference, Tyrone Lobban, head of Onyx Digital Assets at JPMorgan, said that the bank is mulling over tokenizing U.S. Treasuries or money market fund shares. “The overall goal is to bring these trillions of dollars of assets into DeFi, so that we can use these new mechanisms for trading, borrowing [and] lending, but with the scale of institutional assets,” Lobban said.  NFTs and the metaverse  Some brands have circumvented the usual bitcoin-first route and headed straight into non-fungible tokens (NFTs), or digital assets mostly hosted on the Ethereum blockchain.  Some companies have invested in crypto domain names, particularly the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) that are sold as NFTs. Beer company Budweiser purchased beer.eth for 30 ETH and also launched an NFT collection. Following Budweiser, other food and beverage companies entered NFTs. Taco Bell (YUM), for instance, sold tokens to raise funds for a variety of purposes. Arizona Iced Tea bought a Bored Ape NFT and put it on its can.  Closely linked with NFTs is the metaverse, an oft-ambiguous term that refers to a digital space where humans interact with one another through avatars. Since Facebook rebranded to Meta in October 2021, multinational corporations have beefed up marketing and strategy investments in the metaverse.  See Also: How to Invest in the Metaverse  Although CEO Mark Zuckerberg's idea of the metaverse primarily entails VR-powered workspaces called “infinity offices” and isn’t necessarily built on a public blockchain, for the crypto industry the metaverse revolves around virtual land and gaming environments like The Sandbox and Decentraland.  In November 2021, Barbados opened up an embassy in Decentraland, and in January 2022, the Warner Music Group (WMG) unveiled plans for a music theme park in The Sandbox. HSBC also bought a plot of land in The Sandbox with plans in the future ”to engage with sports, e-sports and gaming fans.”  Since the metaverse is a virtual space where avatars interact with one another, these avatars surely need pieces of digital clothes. In December 2021, footwear giant Nike (NKE) acquired NFT collectibles and fashion startup RTFKT for an undisclosed amount. RTFKT produces virtual sneakers.  Although there are shopping malls being built in the metaverse, mainstream adoption still has a long way to go. “I don’t think anyone can put a time or date, but I will say that this decade is a decade of building and pioneering,” Cathy Hackl, aka the Godmother of the Metaverse, told CoinDesk in December 2021.",POSITIVE,BTC | ENS,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | ENS,Ekin Genç,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/how-are-institutions-and-companies-investing-in-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c2b9afedf48df527935cb73743d86f6aa8be5b5c-3573x2859.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42423032,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy241Fh,1656102596,"Market Wrap: From GBTC Discount to Short Bitcoin ETF, Traders See Reasons for Optimism","Hi, I'm Bradley Keoun, here to take you through the day's crypto market highlights and news.  Bitcoin (BTC) held steady at about $21,000 in Friday afternoon trading.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $21,030, up 3% over the past 24 hours. This weekend, however, could pose another test for bitcoin, analysts say, as reported by Jimmy He.  “This weekend could be another testing period for the cryptocurrency, despite the resilience shown this week in holding back above such a major level,” Oanda senior market analyst Craig Erlam said. “The support still looks shaky below and another break could see confidence in the space really put to the test.”  Despite the continuing shakeout in the crypto industry, analysts were eyeing key market indicators for signs that prices might have hit a bottom. Those include a narrowing in the so-called Grayscale discount (read more on that below by Lyllah Ledesma) and – in a perverse twist of logic – data showing stock investors piling into an exchange-traded fund designed to profit from further declines in the price bitcoin, as reported by Krisztian Sandor.  ""The quote-unquote, relief rally that you've seen in the last 24 hours, I think it's largely stemming from the retail side of things,"" Raghu Yarlagadda, CEO and co-founder of FalconX, a crypto trading platform for institutional investors, said Friday on CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program.  In traditional markets, stocks rallied after a University of Michigan survey showed that consumers tempered their expectations for future inflation compared with the prior reading – seen by traders as a reason to worry less that those expectations might become a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $21,313 +2.01%      ●Ether (ETH): $1,241 +9.50%      ●S&P 500 daily close: 3,911.74 +3.06%      ●Gold: $1,826 per troy ounce +0.02%      ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 3.13% 0.057       Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  The ""GBTC discount"" narrows, and analysts ask why  By Lyllah Ledesma  A key metric known in crypto markets as the ""Grayscale discount"" is narrowing, possibly a sign of optimism on the part of some traders as the deadline approaches for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to rule on a proposal to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust – the world's largest cryptocurrency fund – into an exchange-traded fund.  The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which is often referred to by its stock trading symbol GBTC, is a type of investment vehicle that allows U.S. investors to gain exposure to price movements of BTC.  GBTC shares were recently trading at a discount of 29% to bitcoin’s price, according to data from Skew. That's down from 34% last week. The shares have been trading at a discount since February 2021; previously, the shares had traded at a premium to bitcoin's price.  It might be a sign of stock traders bottom-feeding for bitcoin at a discount, or it might be a sign that traders think the conversion will win approval. Or it might be a sign that fears of a deeper liquidity crisis across the crypto industry might have passed.

42423030,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy241Hh,1656101568,Goldman Sachs Leading Investor Group to Buy Celsius Assets: Sources,"Goldman Sachs is looking to raise $2 billion from investors to buy up distressed assets from troubled crypto lender Celsius, according to two people familiar with the matter.  The proposed deal would allow investors to buy up Celsius’ assets at potentially big discounts in the event of a bankruptcy filing, the people said.  Goldman Sachs appears to be gauging interest and soliciting commitments from Web3 crypto funds, funds specializing in distressed assets and traditional financial institutions with ample cash on hand, according to a person familiar with the situation. The assets, most likely cryptocurrencies having to be sold on the cheap, would then likely be managed by participants in the fundraising push.  Celsius has tapped restructuring advisory firm Alvarez & Marsal, the Wall Street Journal reported Friday afternoon.  Goldman Sachs did not respond to a request for comment.  Celsius, which had more than $8 billion lent out to clients and $12 billion in assets under management as of May of this year, abruptly announced on June 12 that it would stop withdrawals from its platform, citing “extreme market conditions.” The disclosure exacerbated those conditions, briefly sending bitcoin’s price below $20,000.  In addition to hiring Alvarez & Marsal, Celsius has tapped restructuring attorneys from law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month. Global investment bank Citigroup has also been enlisted by Celsius to advise on possible solutions, including an assessment of an offer from rival crypto lender Nexo, The Block reported.  Citigroup (C) and Akin Gump have both recommended Celsius file for bankruptcy, according to people familiar with the matter. Citigroup declined to comment. Akin Gump did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Celsius raised $750 million from investors last year, including Canada’s second-largest pension fund, Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ), valuing the business at $3.25 billion.

42421523,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoYO5,1656100769,Why the Crypto Crash Will Accelerate Regulatory Action,"In March, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said it's “easy to see the risks” of cryptocurrencies, and warned that central banks “don’t know how some digital products will behave in times of market stress.”  What they have seen lately will not give them comfort. The sudden and rapid collapse of popular crypto projects sheds light on the house-of-cards nature of many crypto products and provides the perfect ""told you so” moment for already-wary regulators.  Tracy Basinger is a senior adviser at Klaros, a financial advisory and investment firm.  Jonah Crane is a partner at Klaros.  First, in early May, TerraUSD, an algorithmic stablecoin, rapidly collapsed, erasing billions of dollars of value in just a few short days. Then Celsius halted redemptions by customers who had deposited funds, and is believed to be nearing insolvency. The drastic moves by Celsius – and forced liquidations of leveraged positions – roiled crypto markets. Bitcoin briefly touched $20,000 and is down more than 70% since its November 2021 peak.  These debacles and the uneasiness they have caused will likely instill regulators and policymakers with a new sense of urgency to address issues that have gnawed at the crypto industry. But these problems and the decline in crypto prices could also present a great opportunity to create a clearer path forward. They come against a backdrop of already-accelerating regulatory pressure.  What regulators have said  In August 2021, the federal banking agencies launched crypto “sprints” and, in the fall of 2021, laid out their agenda for 2022. In November 2021, the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets (PWG), released a report detailing risks associated with stablecoins, including the risk of a panic akin to a bank run, and called on Congress to pass new legislation limiting stablecoin issuance to insured banks. Then in March 2022, President Biden issued an executive order on digital assets. The report acknowledged potential benefits of innovation in digital assets, but emphasized the downsides: The word “risk” appeared 47 times.  Read More: As Federal Agencies Organize, US States Continue to Lead in Regulating Digital Assets  A wide range of state and federal regulators have weighed in following the implosion of Terra, and again following Celsius’ troubles and the broader market collapse. After the Terra collapse, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen called for a “comprehensive framework” governing stablecoins and urged Congress to act. Subsequently, the SEC was reported to be investigating the marketing of TerraUSD by Terraform Labs.  Just days after Celsius halted redemptions, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler cautioned that crypto platforms promising high returns may be too good to be true. Meanwhile, state securities regulators in Alabama, Kentucky, New Jersey, Texas and Washington have opened an investigation into Celsius’ actions. After Terra’s failure, Gensler announced the agency would add 20 investigators and litigators to its unit dedicated to cryptocurrency and cybersecurity enforcement.  In addition, more than 40 states have some type of crypto legislation in place or pending in their legislature. And California Gov. Gavin Newsom recently issued an executive order on cryptocurrencies, mapping out a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets.  Ghosts of financial crises past  This latest market crash reveals just how much consumers could lose – two trillion dollars of crypto asset's market cap have been wiped out. And both Terra and Celsius provide glaringly bad examples of the fragile financial engineering mixed with hyperaggressive promotion that has led regulators to see echoes of past financial crises.  The collapse of the Terra stablecoin and resulting market volatility will leave regulators who have been warning of the risks associated with crypto feeling vindicated. Terra experienced the equivalent of an old-fashioned bank run when investors began to lose confidence that they would always be able to redeem their token for a dollar. That’s exactly what the PWG (and many others, including Sam Bankman-Fried) warned would happen.  Moreover, Terra achieved its scale (roughly $18 billion in circulation at its peak) because it could be deposited into a yield protocol and earn up to 20% interest. Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu recently compared yield farming to Ponzi schemes – and he’s not alone. The Anchor Protocol promised UST depositors 20% yields, with no realistic way to continue paying out interest if money stopped flooding in. Celsius used its borrowed assets as collateral to borrow more and make a series of risky bets – including investing in the Anchor Protocol – in search of returns to meet its promise to pay “depositors” 8%.  Read More: Defining Cryptocurrency Regulation Important for the Industry to Grow: Morgan Stanley  Finally, both Terra and Celsius caused volatility across crypto markets – a foreshadowing of the significant spillover effects that might occur if, say, Tether were to collapse. This kind of financial contagion risk is exactly what regulators try to prevent.  How to prepare  At this point, crypto companies should assume regulation is inevitable. If the industry wants to help itself, it must be at the table. But more than that, industry leaders must be willing to overhaul the way large portions of these markets work.  On stablecoins, industry leaders should clearly distinguish among different models and begin a dialogue about the ways in which certain models, and certain regulatory reforms, could achieve the regulators’ policy objectives. Amid the Terra crash, the market clearly viewed certain stablecoins – namely, 100% dollar-backed coins – as more stable than others. And yet Tether, which has broken the buck multiple times in recent weeks, remains a critical element of a major portion of crypto market activity.  For their part, regulators, too, should begin to recognize that not all stablecoins are created equal. Regulators were right to warn of “run risks” inherent in stablecoins, but have done little to distinguish between stablecoins and “unstable” coins. The New York Department of Financial Services, which regulates two stablecoin issuers, released public guidance requiring stablecoin reserves to be held in safe and liquid assets and be subject to independent attestations. This guidance provides an excellent foundation for developing a truly stable framework.  Hsu issued a call for public-private collaboration on developing stablecoin standards. That is an invitation the industry should accept.  More broadly, there needs to be a reckoning within the industry. The desire for open and decentralized crypto markets makes many participants averse to prescriptive rules. But inherently fragile products have served to accelerate and multiply the damage of a crypto downturn. Industry leaders should take advantage of the crypto winter to clear the underbrush that could be the kindling for the next inferno. It’s time to recognize that many products simply aren’t consistent with fair and orderly markets.

42374415,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZRwH,1656097573,"With Bitwise and Grayscale Decisions Looming, Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval Hopes Are Running Low","Expectations for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of two upcoming spot bitcoin ETF (exchange-traded fund) applications are low, and have faded since the approval of Teucrium’s futures-based product that initially provided some optimism.  The two applications currently on investors’ radar are those of the Bitwise Bitcoin ETP Trust, with a decision deadline of July 1, and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), with a deadline of July 6. (Grayscale’s parent company is the Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk as an independent subsidiary.) Both investment issuers have had their current applications delayed multiple times by the SEC and the upcoming dates represent a final deadline for the SEC to make a decision.  Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart, who closely tracks the ETF sector, told CoinDesk he views the approval of either application as “highly unlikely.” Seyffart said the SEC has been clear about what it wants to see before giving the green light to a spot bitcoin product.  “The [SEC is] not approving a spot bitcoin ETF until a ‘market of significant size’ has surveillance-sharing agreements or is regulated by the likes of the SEC or CFTC,” Seyffart said.  Thus, until a “spot bitcoin exchange or likely multiple spot bitcoin exchanges come under the purview of the SEC and/or CFTC, the SEC isn't going to approve a spot bitcoin ETF,” he said.  Similar thoughts were shared by Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, an investment advisory firm specializing in ETFs. “The overwhelming market assumption is that the SEC will disapprove these ETFs,” Geraci told CoinDesk, adding that SEC Chair Gary Gensler hasn’t provided any change in communications around these approvals.  “Chairman Gensler has consistently messaged that until the SEC has some level of direct regulatory oversight of crypto exchanges, a spot bitcoin ETF won’t be approved,” Geraci said.  To be sure, the recent narrowing of the discount between GBTC's share price and the price of bitcoin has led some to speculate there's optimism in the marketplace regarding an approval Other observers foresee an approval at some point, though the recent turmoil from firms such as Celsius and BlockFi may cause the SEC to slow down any approvals in the near-term.  “It seems that it’s no longer a question of ‘if’ but just a question of ‘when’ the SEC will finally approve a spot ETF,” Bradley Duke, co-CEO of London-based ETF issuer ETC Group. “But the current crypto market turbulence, including the fallout from the collapse of UST and Terra Luna and the distress of major crypto finance firms like Celsius and BlockFi, could all contribute to giving the SEC reason to delay further opening of the floodgates.”  And a dragged-out process may not be the best sign for the sector, according to Oppenheimer equity research analyst Owen Lau.  “It appears to me that the longer it takes, the farther the industry tends to walk away from the SEC, and the harder it becomes to get the approval,” Lau told CoinDesk. “The chance that it might take a very long time to get the spot ETFs approval, or it might never get approved by the SEC, has been increasing.”  The longer-term outlook  While Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan wasn’t able to comment on his company’s specific application with the SEC, he’s optimistic the U.S. market will eventually see a spot bitcoin ETF.  “In general, I think it's right to look at the SEC's recent actions and see continued progress in their comfort with the bitcoin space,” Hougan told CoinDesk.  “We now have a 1940 Act bitcoin futures ETF, a 1933 Act bitcoin futures ETF and an inverse bitcoin futures ETF,” Hougan noted, referring to previous approvals of bitcoin-related ETFs. “Each one represents increasing comfort with the bitcoin market.”  In the end, a spot bitcoin ETF will lower costs and make the way American investors access the bitcoin market more secure, Hougan argued.  For its part, Grayscale has been more assertive in seeking an approval. Some of its efforts have included marketing to urge members of the public to voice their support to the SEC, a May meeting with the SEC and the strengthening of its legal team with the addition of Donald B. Verrilli Jr., who previously served as a solicitor general in the Obama Administration.  GBTC, with about $13 billion in assets under management, currently trades at a 29% discount to NAV.  Earlier this week, Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein took to Twitter to argue that the recent launch of an inverse bitcoin futures ETF may be a positive sign for the sector and the eventual prospects of a spot bitcoin ETF.

42393972,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brwbUB,1656097080,"This Buenos Aires Evangelist Offers Tours to Expound Bitcoin, Tourists Love It","It was 10 a.m. on a sunny Thursday in Buenos Aires' government district, and Jerónimo Ferrer was about to make his Bitcoin pitch to an audience of two French tourists.  “This is the story of how Argentina took my savings not once, but twice,” he began.  Ferrer, a 48-year-old bitcoin evangelist who works full-time as Argentina’s head of business development at Paxful, a peer-to-peer crypto exchange, has been giving the same tour about Bitcoin and Argentina’s history since 2019 in his free time. Tourists and locals pay $35 for the approximately two-hour visit around Buenos Aires’ center.  During the tour, entitled Our Local Crazy Economy & Bitcoin, Ferrer explains how the chaotic Argentinian economy works and the reason crypto is booming in the country.  Read more: Argentina Was at the Cusp of a Crypto Boom. The Central Bank Had Other Plans  “I started these tours because I needed to spread bitcoin as a tool of freedom in a country that does not have a strong currency, with runaway inflation at an average rate of 70%. That is where this cryptocurrency becomes important in terms of taking care of our own economy,” Ferrer told CoinDesk.  After his opening line in front of the Government House, Ferrer gave a summarized brief of Argentina’s economic history from 1980 to the present, and how its turbulence affected his own economy.  Ferrer recounted two crises in detail. The first one took place in 2001, when after 10 years of being pegged to the U.S. dollar, the Argentine peso collapsed and banks closed, preventing people from withdrawing their money – a phenomenon known locally as corralito.  Less than a decade later, in 2008, the government closed the private pension savings system — known as AFJP for its Spanish acronyms — and confiscated the savings of 9.5 million people, he said.  A victim of both events, Ferrer started looking for other ways of saving and found bitcoin when, during one of his previous jobs, an Italian client asked him to pay in that cryptocurrency.  “I fell in love with it,” he said.  Ferrer started touring in February 2019 out of pure passion, with the clear goal of “bitcoinizing every corner of Argentina,” as he says on his Twitter profile. With the same objective, he also organizes a monthly event, Bitcoin Night, where he persuades a restaurant to accept payment in bitcoin, in exchange for bringing a lot of bitcoiners to dinner.  Since then, he has conducted 150 tours through Airbnb, with an average of four attendees per occasion. On the booking platform, the proposal has a rating of 4.9 (out of 5) stars, and almost all attendees thank Ferrer for the visit.  “Jerónimo was able to teach me a little bit about the history, benefits and advantages of cryptocurrency. He stepped me through the process of buying and selling. I am now the proud owner of an infinitesimal portion of a coin,” David, a tourist who was part of one of the visits in February 2022, posted on Airbnb.  Crypto coffee  The tour continued with a walk to Argentina’s Central Bank Museum, closed due to the pandemic that day. Although unable to take the group inside, Ferrer described the museum as the place where “Argentina most proudly showed its greatest economic failures.”  The group then moved to Rossi, a small but cozy coffee place two blocks away. Inside, attendees listened to the whole bitcoin story over coffee, starting with Satoshi Nakamoto’s white paper, through the Bitcoin Pizza Day, and on to bitcoin’s market-high price in November 2021 and, finally, today’s bear market price, which has fallen a long way off that peak.  “If you hold your keys, bitcoin cannot be confiscated – it has no borders. I can send $1 million to a Chinese bitcoin address and nobody will stop it, as it is censorship-resistant. It works,” Ferrer said, before explaining basic crypto concepts such as mining or holding.  Later, Ferrer urged the group to download a Lightning-powered hot wallet to show how “easy and anonymous” it is to transfer bitcoin on the layer 2 payments protocol, distributing 1,000 satoshis among the participants, who obeyed his command after a few moments of confusion and glances of suspicion.  After numerous inflation and devaluation processes in the past 70 years, Argentines took refuge in the U.S. dollar to protect their income. But the price of dollars now fluctuates wildly depending on the exchange, a source of frustration for locals.  Read more: Why Argentines Are Turning From Dollars to Stablecoins Like DAI  Now, the country has a year-on-year inflation rate of more than 60% while, since 2019, it has been experiencing an escalating devaluation that drove the price of the peso from $0.018 in August of that year to its current price of $0.0081 in the official exchange rate.  To reduce the drain of dollars from its reserves, in 2019, the government installed a barrier — known as a cepo in Spanish — that prevents locals from acquiring more than $200 per month through banks.  As he walked and talked, Ferrer began to explain how the impossibility of accessing dollars created illegal exchange offices known as “caves” and usually hidden behind traditional businesses such as jewelry stores, where dollars are sold at a price up to 100% more expensive than the official quotation.  The French tourists, who knew little about the Argentinian economy and less about cryptocurrency, listened very carefully and asked how the different U.S. dollar exchange rates work in Argentina. Astonished, he asked for a second time the inflation rate in the country.  The group stopped at a shop with the sign “Jewelry and Watch Atelier” on the front. When an electrical door opened, there was a waiting aisle with nothing but a photograph on a shelf, showing Ferrer, the shop employees and the Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin smiling at the camera.  When Buterin visited Argentina in December 2021, he assisted with Ferrer's tour. “I didn’t know what to do, it was pleasantly shocking,” Ferrer recalled, adding that Buterin changed some ether for ARS 93,000 — approximately $450, according to the informal exchange rate of that day — to use during his time in Argentina.  Another secured door opened and the truth behind the “jewelry store” was revealed: There was an office with an enormous desk displaying banknotes from different countries, and a man behind it asking how much the group wanted to change. Captivated, the French tourists decided to change 20 euros into Argentine pesos.  After leaving the exchange house, Ferrer guided the group to a bitcoin ATM located in a second basement of a shopping center’s garage, but unfortunately it didn’t work either.  “When I receive tourists, there are some who do not know that by spending their money through traditional means, they spend twice as much, so bitcoin helps them bring their money and make it worth its real value,” Ferrer said, without conceding that the number of places to spend bitcoin in Buenos Aires is limited.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,Marina Lammertyn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/24/this-buenos-aires-evangelist-offers-tours-to-expound-bitcoin-tourists-love-it,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/64b32165d7689dd45ea170ff6df0476aca93d20e-960x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42423038,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy241Th,1656096326,Grayscale Bitcoin Trust's 'GBTC Discount' Narrows With ETF Decision on Horizon,"A key metric known in crypto markets as the ""Grayscale discount"" is narrowing, possibly a sign of optimism on the part of some traders as the deadline approaches for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to rule on a proposal to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust – the world's largest cryptocurrency fund – into an exchange-traded fund.  The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, often referred to by its stock-trading symbol GBTC, is a type of investment vehicle that allows U.S. investors to gain exposure to price movements of BTC.  Grayscale (whose parent company Digital Currency Group also owns CoinDesk) has applied to convert the GBTC into an exchange-traded fund, or ETF. And for months, some traders have been monitoring the discount as a proxy for the likelihood of winning approval. According to the market logic, the GBTC would trade at par with the underlying bitcoin in the fund if the conversion goes forward; in other words, the discount would evaporate.  And lately, it has been narrowing.  The GBTC shares are currently trading at a discount of 29% to bitcoin’s price, according to data from Skew. That's down from 34% last week. The shares have been trading at a discount since February 2021; previously, the shares had traded at a premium to the bitcoin price.  Pablo Jodar, financial products manager at Storm Partners, a systems provider for the cryptocurrency space in Europe, said that as the discount narrows, hedge funds are using GBTC as an arbitrage tool to benefit from the price convergence between GBTC and BTC.  “The stock price is coming closer to the net asset value (NAV) of the underlying assets, meaning the market could have turned more positive on BTC,” said Jodar.  Some analysts are also attributing the discount to people betting on the spot ETF conversion approval. Grayscale has been lobbying heavily for the SEC approval – coupled with a marketing campaign that appears designed to sway public opinion; this week, blurbs sponsored by Grayscale describing a spot bitcoin ETF as ""critical"" ran in the financial-industry newsletter Politico Morning Money.  Officials from Grayscale and another investment firm, Bitwise, said at CoinDesk's Consensus 2022 conference earlier this month that they are optimistic the spot ETF will finally be approved by the SEC soon. In October 2021 Grayscale initially applied to convert its GBTC into a spot ETF. The SEC has since pushed off a decision, but currently plans to render a verdict by July 6.  Grayscale also met with the SEC in early May to better make its case for turning the GBTC into a spot bitcoin ETF.  “We remain encouraged by the SEC's actions over the past eight months, which have signaled an increased recognition of and comfort with the maturity of the underlying bitcoin market,"" Michael Sonnenshein, CEO of Grayscale, said in an email to CoinDesk forwarded by a representative.  ""The approval of each and every bitcoin-linked investment product strengthens our arguments about why the U.S. market deserves a spot bitcoin ETF,"" Sonnenshein added.  As the discount narrows, according to data from Skew, GBTC trading volume hit a seven-month high.  Sean Farrell, Fundstrat Global Advisors’ head of digital-asset strategy, said that another factor worth considering is the crash of the crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC). The fund suffered heavy losses in the recent market downturn.  “They were large holders of GBTC before last week,” said Farrell. “Having that sell-pressure out of the picture probably gave whoever stepped in here some added confidence that the overall downside for GBTC is greatly reduced.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/06/24/grayscale-bitcoin-trusts-gbtc-discount-narrows-with-etf-decision-on-horizon,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ceb315800693d57e0837ce5ed721c5c9e5fd30c3-1650x1250.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $21,030, up 3% over the past 24 hours. This weekend, however, could pose another test for bitcoin, analysts say.  “This weekend could be another testing period for the cryptocurrency, despite the resilience shown this week in holding back above such a major level,” Oanda senior market analyst Craig Erlam said. “The support still looks shaky below and another break could see confidence in the space really put to the test.”  Last Friday, bitcoin traded at $20,441. But over the weekend, the cryptocurrency slumped to $17,601 as it faced major selling pressure.  Altcoins continued to outperform bitcoin with axie infinity (AXS) and polygon (MATIC) among the biggest gainers, recently rising more than 16% and 13%, respectively, over the past 24 hours.  Simon Peters, a crypto market analyst at Israeli investment firm eToro, said that increasing risk of a recession and poor corporate earnings could further affect stock prices, which have recently correlated with crypto prices. Negative trends in the traditional market could then be reflected in the crypto market.  “It’s too early to say if bitcoin has stabilized at the $20K level,” Peters said. “Fear has somewhat died down in the crypto markets this week, but it hasn't disappeared completely.”  Traditional markets climbed with the S&P 500 recently up 2.4% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq rising 2.5% after a revision in the University of Michigan’s May monthly consumer sentiment index, which now shows expectations for inflation lower than first reported.

Alongside, the company lowered withdrawal fees on a number of cryptos while ending a policy allowing one free withdrawal per month. Both new policies are effective July 1.  Early this week, things did not appear to be going well at BlockFi.  After the crypto crash appeared to wipe out the company’s main competitor Celsius, BlockFi was forced to lay off 20% of its staff and turn to Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX for an emergency $250 million revolving credit facility.  In a filing on Friday, however, BlockFi said it will be increasing deposit rates for BTC, ETH, USDC, GUSD, PAX, BUSD and USDT in July.  The company cites three factors allowing the rate boost: effective risk management, decreasing market competition and a changing macro yield environment.  Regarding risk management, the firm touted its past conservative rate strategy as giving it the wiggle room today to boost rewards for customers in this market downturn.  As for decreasing market competition, BlockFi noted, “​we’ve maintained 100% uptime of our retail platform and institutional lending desk” while others have slowed down or paused those operations.  Turning to the changing macro environment, BlockFi noted that the dramatic rise in U.S. Treasury yields is boosting lending rates, and therefore deposit rates.  In addition to increasing rates, BlockFi said it would be eliminating a policy allowing the free withdrawal of BTC, ETH, and stablecoins once per month. The company will, however, be lowering withdrawal fees on all of those assets.  “In 2022, over 75% of our crypto withdrawals have been honored without any fees,” BlockFi said. “BlockFi was subsidizing this cost for our clients. Due to increased withdrawal demand, we’ve decided to implement a modest fee (maximum of $25) to cover the costs of honoring those requests.”  Today’s news comes alongside reporting from The Wall Street Journal that FTX is in talks to acquire part of BlockFi.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH | USDC,BTC | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | USDC,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/24/blockfi-raises-deposit-rates-eliminates-free-withdrawals,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6c08e1ec19f9721395caada7ee5948ba8b33c21d-4994x3746.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42411790,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfzkt,1656092518,Bitcoin ATMs: What You Need to Know Before Buying Bitcoin at an ATM,"Guides on buying bitcoin (BTC) often start with the advice that you first need to create a cryptocurrency exchange account and download or purchase a crypto wallet to store it in. But there’s another convenient way of purchasing bitcoin that doesn’t involve using a computer, let alone a cryptocurrency exchange.  Using a bitcoin automated teller machine (ATM), people have the opportunity to purchase BTC by inserting cash or their debit cards and completing a few basic steps. But while bitcoin ATMs become a growing part of the industry, the thought of using one still strikes many as being oxymoronic.  How can something like bitcoin, which is a purely digital currency, be dispensed by an ATM that normally spits out physical currency?  It’s a perfectly good question. Here’s what you need to know.  What are bitcoin ATMs?  Bitcoin ATMs let people buy bitcoin – and sometimes other cryptocurrencies – using cash or debit cards. However, the term ATM is somewhat misleading.  Bitcoin ATMs aren’t like bank ATMs that allow customers to manage the funds in their accounts. Bitcoin ATMs are simply tools through which you can make bitcoin purchases – and sometimes sales – and do not require users to create any sort of account to do so.  Unlike cryptocurrency exchanges, bitcoin ATMs give users the option to custody their own purchased bitcoin by wiring the coins directly to a crypto wallet of their choice. However, if you use centralized exchanges like Binance or Coinbase (COIN), you can also opt to have your coins sent to your “deposit address” provided by your exchange and let the platform custody the assets for you.  Read more: What Is Crypto Custody?  Wallet creation is often a key part of the process of buying bitcoin using ATMs, and this is the part that’s usually targeted by scammers (as we’ll explore below).  The first bitcoin ATM popped up in 2013, in a cafe shop in the Canadian city of Vancouver. In those days, it was common practice among bitcoiners to spend bitcoin in cafes or drop 10,000 coins on two pizzas.  Since then, bitcoin ATMs have popped up all over the world. To date, there are 36,610 bitcoin ATMs in 77 different countries, according to data from Coin ATM Radar. Genesis Coin is the largest manufacturer of bitcoin ATMs with 15,140 machines, followed by General Bytes with 7,965 and BitAccess with 5,549.  The top operators of bitcoin ATMs are Bitcoin Depot (19.1% of the market share), CoinCloud (14.1%) and CoinFlip (9.7%).  How to buy bitcoin from a bitcoin ATM  When you spot a bitcoin ATM, you’ll often find it has a QR code plastered on it prompting you to download a particular crypto wallet that’s supported by the ATM machine.  A popular option is the Coinbase crypto wallet, but you can choose from a long list of other wallets, too.  You’ll first need to download the wallet, if you haven’t already, and follow any setup instructions when prompted.  Your newly created wallet will generate a unique bitcoin address to which the ATM will send your purchased coins after the transaction is confirmed and completed.  Bitcoin ATMs are meant to be an intuitive experience for anyone who’s used an ATM before, so all you’ll need to do is just follow instructions on the screen.  Machines will vary somewhat depending on country and location, and some may require you to complete know-your-customer (KYC) steps before permitting the purchase. Minimum and maximum purchase amounts may also vary.  After setting up the wallet and locating your wallet address for inbound transactions, you’ll want to key in the amount you wish to purchase and enter your crypto wallet address. This is usually done automatically by scanning the QR code on your phone screen rather than typing it in manually (which can lead to mistakes and cause your funds to be lost forever.)  The transaction usually takes around 10 minutes to be completed, although it might also take as long as an hour.  Advantages and disadvantages of bitcoin ATMs  For users who aren’t tech-savvy, bitcoin ATMs are an excellent gateway into crypto. Fortunately, it doesn’t come at the cost of compromised security because most ATMs don’t store users’ KYC information, bank details or private keys.  But there are some obvious disadvantages. Bitcoin ATMs charge exorbitant fees – 7%-20% in some cases – and there are also more stringent limits on purchases compared to a cryptocurrency exchange. Also, in the event anything goes wrong, there’s little to no customer support available.  Beware of scams involving bitcoin ATMs  There are two scams that involve using bitcoin ATMs.  Scammers often advertise goods for sale on sites like eBay, Craigslist or Gumtree (UK). These items are typically priced at a significant discount to the usual market rate, luring potential buyers to get in touch.  The scammers tell victims they must make purchases via crypto if they want to secure those prices – usually by depositing funds into a bitcoin ATM and sending the crypto to the scammers’ wallet address. Once the transaction is completed, the scammers vanish.  This is popular with scammers because of the irreversible and largely unregulated nature of blockchain-based payments. Once a transaction is finalized, it’s next to impossible to reverse it.  Another type of bitcoin ATM scam is more convoluted and sinister.  Scammers often target individuals seeking employment and offer them trial work. The trial involves scammers sending money to a person's bank account and then telling the person to withdraw it and convert the funds into bitcoin at a bitcoin ATM, then transfer the cryptocurrency to the scammers’ address.  A few days later, however, the money sent to the victim’s account is reversed because it originated from a stolen account. That leaves the victim’s account with a negative balance. (Here’s one story by a Reddit poster who was swindled out of funds this way.)  Overall, if you’re looking to purchase a reasonable amount of bitcoin in a relatively private manner and you’re not particularly bothered about paying high fees, then a bitcoin ATM could be a good choice for you – provided there are machines in your area, of course. Otherwise, using an exchange or purchasing bitcoin through apps you most likely already have on your smartphone are also good options.

42423080,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy26jbh,1656091278,Investors Pile Into Short Bitcoin ETF Betting on Prices to Fall,"Investors have piled into a recently launched bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) that's designed to profit from price declines in the cryptocurrency – to the extent that the vehicle is now the second-largest bitcoin-focused ETF in the U.S. market after just a few trading days.  The ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy (BITI) ETF raked in the equivalent of 544.2 BTC, or $11 million at current prices, making it the second-largest exchange-traded bitcoin fund listed in Vetle Lunde, an analyst at Arcane Research, noted.  The fund is designed to deliver the inverse of bitcoin's performance, meaning that the fund's investors book a 1% profit on their investment if BTC price falls 1% (before management fees and expenses), by holding BTC derivatives. It started trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday.  BITI's lackluster performance on the opening day met with a shrug from analysts.  BITI, however, saw strong inflows on Wednesday and Thursday, and had assets under management equivalent to 929 BTC, overtaking the bitcoin futures ETFs of fund providers Valkyrie and VanEck, Lunde said.  The largest U.S.-listed bitcoin ETF is ProShares futures-based bitcoin ETF (BITO), which is far bigger than all competitors at the equivalent of 31,000 BTC in assets under management, or $651 million at current prices.  BITI's strong performance reflects the fragile state of the cryptocurrency market as traders weigh whether it is a good time to buy BTC and how much further its price could fall.  ""The recession reality appears to be driving markets at the moment,"" Oanda senior market analyst Craig Erlam said. ""I don't see that improving in the near future, which makes current support in bitcoin around $20,000 look vulnerable.""  On Twitter, some posters called out the launch of the short bitcoin fund as a potential bottom signal, a counterintuitive take that's not without a logical precedent: ProShares' announcement last October that it would introduce a bitcoin futures ETF came just weeks before BTC climbed to its all-time high of nearly $69,000 in November.  John Freyermuth, a research analyst at Enigma Securities, said that it's still very early to assess the product's success. ""The most risk-conscious participants are unlikely to explore these futures-based ETFs, much less one with inverse exposure to a futures index,"" he said.  Many crypto-industry executives and traders have long pined for regulatory approval of a spot bitcoin ETF, which would let stock investors gain exposure to the largest crypto asset without actually owning any, because they see the structure as superior to the futures-based funds that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has approved so far.  ""It's remarkable that another derivatives-based product launched before a spot-based product,"" Freyermuth said.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/06/24/investors-pile-into-short-bitcoin-etf-betting-on-prices-to-fall,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5ba6459294367dc6fe0325d41c87c6f1b799e858-1323x979.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

But those cases will require navigating some tricky questions. Because lending protocols in particular have been studiously vague in describing the exact nature of their services, it's not clear what sort of responsibilities these companies have when it comes to depositor's funds.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  “The jury is still out on that,” according to Marcelo Diaz-Cortes, a securities litigation lawyer with the Miami-based firm LKLSG. Diaz-Cortes contrasts currently distressed crypto projects with straightforward fraud cases he’s helped litigate, such as Argyle Coin, a supposedly diamond-backed token that was in reality a Ponzi scheme. “It was a straight fraud – it didn’t really exist.”  That wasn’t the case with the most dramatic collapse of recent weeks, the unwinding of the TerraUSD “algorithmic stablecoin” in May. That token’s design was so deeply flawed that its demise was easy for experts to predict – but its mechanism was described transparently and, it seems, mostly accurately.  “It wasn’t a secret as to how the thing functioned,” Diaz-Cortes said. “If that was the way it really worked, [judging it fraudulent] would be a tough sell for a court, for a jury.”  That doesn’t mean there’s no case. In standard securities cases, fraud can still be found “when someone at the company or promoting it had a little extra knowledge and didn’t disclose it,” according to Diaz-Cortes.  A court might, for instance, examine statements from Do Kwon or Terraform Labs about transitioning UST to a backed model, or rumors that the token was secretly bailed out by third parties when it previously lost its peg in May of 2021. Either could imply that, despite public statements, the team knew its creation didn’t actually work as advertised.  Another good sign for anyone pursuing relief directly from Terra’s creators is that they appear to now be under investigation in Korea, one of the group’s centers of operation. While such investigations are usually kept under wraps until they conclude, they can still provide firepower for plaintiffs.  “It’s certainly something we put in our complaints,” Diaz-Cortes said. “Look, the government’s sniffing, the government filed an action. … At hearings, we’ll point to it as circumstantial evidence of something fishy going on.”  Some wiped-out Lunatics have instead focused legal firepower on the exchanges, with one class-action suit targeting Binance.US, an exchange that sold the UST token and described it, according to the complaint, as “safe.” Diaz-Cortes believes such suits against exchanges could have legs if an exchange or other promoter was “not completely forthright about the potential [risk] exposure.”  See also: What Crypto Can Learn From Elizabeth Holmes' Fraud | Opinion  The same group of plaintiffs, which includes pseudonymous Terra victim and researcher Fatman, has said it will also file suit against Terraform Labs, the entity that created a litany of apps – like the lending protocol Anchor – that used the LUNA and UST tokens. That possibility highlights one of the key underlying points in the Terra case: Despite leaning on the rhetoric of “decentralization,” Terra was tightly controlled by a small inner group. That could in and of itself become further grounds for claims of misrepresentation and fraud.  Is Celsius a bank?  The “lending platform” Celsius could be accused of similarly exaggerated claims – while it tied itself rhetorically to DeFi, or decentralized finance, it is an entirely centralized entity that merely acted as an intermediary to DeFi. That also makes it a ripe target for lawsuits after it froze withdrawals – potentially a prelude to default.  One early, if flaccid, signal came from YouTube influencer BitBoy, who last week announced his intent to file a class action against Celsius after it froze his funds. Just days later, BitBoy withdrew the proposal after remembering that he had been paid to promote Celsius, as he was for years paid directly to promote scams. This is the epitome of the extremely useful expression “hoisted by his own petard.” Truly a shame.  Regardless, more competent actors are sure to draw a bead on Celsius. The problem is that it and similar “lending platforms” have avoided clear classification and regulation. Depositors seeking high yields often used these platforms as crypto banks, despite the lack of regulation and consumer protections.  In fact, recent regulatory actions taken against interest-bearing accounts at lending platform BlockFi characterize the offerings as unregistered securities. BlockFi itself isn’t facing quite the same financial problems as Celsius, so it might not wind up a target of private lawsuits. But if a court thinks Celsius or a similar platform were also actually selling securities rather than banking services, it could be harmful for depositors because buying a security doesn’t imply any right to redeem it for a specific price.  Another legal question is what Celsius actually did with depositors’ money to earn the yield it passed onto them. As CoinDesk reported this month, the platform began pursuing increasingly risky strategies starting in early 2021, including sending client funds to volatile DeFi “yield farms,” later including Luna’s Anchor protocol.  Though Celsius apparently withdrew funds from Anchor before the Terra collapse, the general investment strategy could face scrutiny in court.  Under conventional banking law, there’s no duty to disclose the loans or other strategies used to generate yield on customer deposits.  “[Banks] don’t owe customers special duties of care. They just owe those deposits back when you ask for it,” Diaz-Cortes said. “You’re not able to bring in issues as to, ‘you shouldn’t have done this with the money.’”  He added that “it’s just a black and white thing” whether banks can meet their obligations and “not necessarily fraud” if they’ve re-hypothecated funds.  See also: How the Feds Are Prosecuting an NFT Insider Trading Scheme | Opinion  But that’s only true up to a certain point. “The question will be whether they did something reckless, fraudulent and irresponsible” with client funds, Diaz-Cortes said. “It’s going to come down to what they knew and what was happening behind the curtain.”  Alternatively, plaintiffs might argue that Celsius wasn’t a bank at all but rather a broker investing on their behalf.  “In terms of these crypto deposit accounts, they’re a little bit of both [bank and brokerage],” Diaz-Cortes said. “You’re not just putting $10 in and expecting $10 back. You’re leaving it there [to earn] interest.”  That could lower the bar for what counts as fraud, according to Diaz-Cortes. “With brokerage accounts, sometimes you do get those claims that this was advertised as a safe investment, and you breached the duty.”",NEUTRAL,LUNA,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | LUNA | REGULATION,David Z.

42374421,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZS55,1656086946,"‘We’re Poor Again, but We’re Still Here’: Why NFT.NYC Won’t Die","On a bustling Monday afternoon in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan, protesters chanted down Grand Street, picket signs ablaze.  “God hates NFTs,” a few of the signs read. “Vitalik is the anti-Christ,” said another. “Anti-MetaMasker.”  A video of the Westboro Baptist Church-style protest went viral on Twitter, but people eventually realized it was a marketing ploy for a new non-fungible token (NFT) mint ahead of NFT.NYC, the industry’s leading conference that the city would play host to for the rest of the week.  The fact that the protest could have been real, along with the brief lack of recognition that it wasn’t, captured how many attendees were feeling toward the state of Web3: Nobody really knows what’s going on anymore, but it’s likely God does hate NFTs.  The week’s ambiguity was also due in part from ether (ETH), the underlying asset of most of the NFT industry, crashing in price last week to as low as $1,000, making most NFT holders a lot poorer than they were during the last NFT.NYC, when ETH hit its all-time high price of $4,812.  Nevertheless, the NFT show was committed to go on. Flights were booked, venues reserved, open bars set. Crypto prices aside, most attendees were prepared to have just as much fun as they did last November, possibly indulging in one last week of parties before a looming BUIDL season.  1,500 speakers  The trend for NFT conferences in the past year has been well documented: The programming gets worse, the parties get better, the bags keep getting pumped.  But this year’s NFT.NYC took it to the extreme, with the meme of the conference being its 1,500 scheduled speakers. The fault being, of course, that the list of people in the entire world worth listening to talk about NFT isn’t 1,500-people long. Some would say it doesn’t exist at all.  “The programming this year sucks, the panelists have no idea what they’re talking about, I’m never coming back,” one attendee was overheard saying to another in line for an after-party. “There are panels?” the other responded.  Attendance was as expected. The dissonance between the industry’s participants and promotional underpinnings loomed larger than normal.  The week’s epicenter of cringe, the Times Square MoonPay lobby, was as much of a spectacle as any of the performance art. Builders, as they do, talked about building, on-rampers discussed on-ramping. NFT clothing – brightly colored, logos large and unforgiving – was worn in abundance.  A week of parties  The week was, and was always supposed to be, about the parties.  Lavish satellite events were the cornerstone of last fall’s conference, and it could be argued they were even better this year.  Events from profile-picture NFT collections stole the show. Moonbird holders witnessed David Blaine sew his mouth shut. Pudgy Penguin and Cool Cats owners wandered IRL installations with plentiful merch, enjoying token-gated parties of their own by night.  At the Doodles marquee event, the project’s CEO unveiled legendary hip-hop producer Pharrell Williams to be the collection’s new brand leader, triggering a thunderous response from an at-capacity theater of holders who have all watched their NFTs drop $50,000 in value since the start of May.  “Pump our bags! Pump our bags!” one inebriated Doodles holder yelled. His companions couldn’t help but nod in agreement.  Read more: Doodles NFT Project Taps Pharrell Williams as Chief Brand Officer  Maybe the hottest project of all, Goblintown, was also active throughout the week. A secret Goblin after-party in Chelsea Market was host to dozens of cloaked attendees and ghoulish performers.  NFT auction chad Beeple roamed the dance floor making goblin noises, comedian Nick Kroll was confused at what he saw. At the end of the night, the party’s DJ stepped to the front of the stage, revealing himself to be, who else, Steve Aoki. The smell of McGoblin Burgers wafted over the dance floor.  The largest party of the week was ApeFest, a separate but concurrent festival thrown by Yuga Labs, stewards of the Bored Ape Yacht Club.  “ApeFest was incredible,” Tom, a 73-year-old who bought a Mutant Ape Yacht Club NFT last October, told CoinDesk in an interview. “You’ve gotta live life fast, that’s what I say. This is my second NFT conference, and I’m having a blast.”  Performers on the Pier 17 ape stage included Eminem, Snoop Dogg, LCD SoundSystem and Lil Baby. Amy Schumer was also there, once again stealing off-color jokes, this time from a viral NFT TikTok song that was also the week’s unofficial anthem.  Read more: Solana NFT Marketplace Magic Eden Raises $130M at $1.6B Valuation  On Wednesday night, Magic Eden hosted a Yacht Party for hundreds of Solana fanboys (and a few girls) fresh off its $130 million raise, bear market be damned. Madonna performed for World of Women holders a few blocks north of the pier the next night.  “We were poor, we were rich, and now we’re poor again.”  The pockets of the NFT community may be bleeding, but this week proved that project founders are doing just fine.  What does it mean  It’s becoming less and less clear what Web3 means, or what the value of NFTs will really be in the long haul. But making my way through various crowds of blue-chip NFT owners, I couldn’t find a single person who regretted holding, even as prices fell from the sky.  “We were poor, we were rich, and now we’re poor again,” one Cool Cats owner told CoinDesk. “But we’re still here.”  Founders staying rich ended up being more of a realization than a rift for most attendees. Few had critiques of their own beyond observations like yacht parties feeling out of place during a bear market, or that merch maybe isn’t the ultimate NFT utility.  Real utility or not, merch stores may be the industry’s bright spot of adoption. Doodles, Cool Cats and LinksDAO all partnered with Shopify to sell their members high-priced crewnecks and T-shirts, in a token-gating announcement that briefly captured the “utility” conversation.  Ironically, it’s possible that ETH plummeting has caused the NFT industry to turn the very charade it's long pretended to be, where the things that founders have said matter most – the art, the community, the belonging – are all that’s left as prices crater.  Maybe what’s left holds up, or evolves or disappears, but for now, everyone seems content with enjoying the free drinks along the way.",NEGATIVE,ETH,ETH | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/06/24/were-poor-again-but-were-still-here-why-nftnyc-wont-die,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/da5ef15ca5a8e69d08608bd0dd093b0b392ca611-3804x2717.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

With the spectacular failures of TerraForm Labs’ LUNA/UST and Celsius, the systemic fallout from the liquidity challenges at Three Arrows Capital and the erasure of almost $2 trillion in value from crypto markets, it should now be clear to all that this industry needs better, clearer and consistent rules.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Whatever comes next must be good for the industry as a whole – the developers, the businesses and most importantly, the users. We need regulation that makes the entire ecosystem more stable and secure, yet which also enables innovators to develop projects that realize the true benefits of decentralization and that give users greater autonomy and sovereignty.  The good news is that, despite the understandable alarm that recent events have sowed among some policymakers, a growing cadre of regulators recognizes the positive potential of cryptocurrencies, digital assets and blockchain technology and genuinely wants to be constructive.  We heard that sentiment at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2022 festival this month. It came from the likes of Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Rustin Benham, Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo, White House Director of Cybersecurity and Secure Digital Innovation Carol House and Federal Reserve Chief Innovation Officer Sunaya Tuteja, as well as from the three senators and one congressman who joined a bipartisan panel of lawmakers.  Also, last week, the Bretton Woods Committee, a nonprofit organization comprising many former regulators and current leaders of the Wall Street and business establishment, unveiled a surprisingly constructive report that we highlighted on our “Money Reimagined” podcast. It was encouraging to find the committee recognizing the benefits of privacy, financial inclusion and international efficiency that permissionless, decentralized and token-based protocols have to offer.  This might be hard to accept for many in the crypto community who’ve seen the government as the enemy, but hearing these people’s open-minded perspectives has put them in a far more positive light than various crypto leaders whose dubious behavior has caused great pain for so many over the past few months.  No knee-jerking, please  Those positive signals notwithstanding, there is real hostility toward this industry in some government quarters. If these skeptics gain the upper hand – especially if public opinion gets behind them – there’s a real risk of a knee-jerk policy response to the latest fallout. One unwelcome upshot might be that regulators end up forcing more centralization on an industry when the best way forward is to build workable decentralized systems that can’t be exploited by self-interested players.  Read more: How Crypto Lender Celsius Overheated  Too much centralization in crypto is, in some respects, the core problem right now. (Consider Celsius’ freeze on withdrawals – it would simply not be possible if, under a more decentralized model, the provider did not have custody of its users’ assets.)  But regulators, working off the old pre-crypto playbook for keeping financial entities in line, instinctively want someone or some entity to be held accountable. That means they can end up favoring the formation of centralized, trusted third parties, the very source of risk, corruption, cost and dependency that cryptocurrency developers have historically sought to replace. If that happens, it would set the industry up for the same “too big to fail” problems that led to the Wall Street collapse of 2008.  Yet crypto users really do need greater protection from businesses and developers who, with their information asymmetry advantages, are in a position to exploit their customers. Regulation should lean into solving that problem in a way that brings transparency and trust to decentralized models and which limits the ability of centralized parties to take outsized risks with their clients’ funds.  Many financial laws are simply incompatible with an entirely new, open-design system  Centralized entities such as Celsius could be required, as brokerages often are, to create segregated accounts that ring-fence clients’ assets – especially crypto collateral posted for loans – from risks taken on by the firm. That will, of course, tie these firms’ hands, giving them less leverage with which to take big bets, which will result in lower yields on clients’ investments. But such is the trade-off for the safer conditions that come from regulation.  This could also mean yield-maximizing opportunities shift to noncustodial decentralized finance (DeFi) models in which users retain control over their private keys.  Yet, after the Terra debacle and a host of hacks and “rug pulls” by founders, users also need protection from flawed projects in DeFi. Here, the way forward may lie in a decentralized version of industry-based self-regulatory organizations (SROs). Token holders with governance voting rights could forge these bodies, preferably with an interoperable purview across different platforms, to agree on software and security standards and, most importantly, on frequent audits of the code.  A DeFi SRO could also borrow from a tool the Federal Reserve applied to banks in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis: stress tests. Simulations of stressful market conditions and of different types of speculative and technical attacks might have revealed the flaws in the Terra ecosystem before it was too late.  Lean into blockchain transparency  Whether these rules and transparency standards are administered by government agencies or by token-holder bodies, they should be taking advantage of a hugely underutilized aspect of blockchain technology: its capacity to enhance transparency around reporting.  In a tweet this week, investor and commentator Maya Zehavi suggested the industry needed its own “on-chain Dodd-Frank or Mifid2,” a reference to the seminal postcrisis financial legislation that was introduced in the U.S. and Europe, respectively, to boost transparency around financial systems.  Her idea is that to reduce the systemic risk exposed by failures such as Three Arrows Capital, users could have access to reliable, blockchain-based data on outstanding trading positions so as to “gauge the overall leverage in [the] centralized platforms” that interact with those blockchains.  The bottom line is that while crypto needs regulation, it must be designed in ways that leverage the strengths of the technology and which are consistent with its core design principles. Whether it’s the 89-year-old U.S. securities law that can’t be reconciled with the commodity-like features of blockchain tokens, or the 51-year-old Bank Secrecy Act, which gave rise to draconian anti-money laundering and know-your-customer rules, many financial laws are simply incompatible with an entirely new, open-design system of finance that crypto proposes.

Specifically, beginning June 27, Coinbase users in the Netherlands wishing to pull crypto from the exchange will have to share the recipient's full name and residential address as well as the purpose of the transfer. In certain circumstances, customers would be required to link a Coinbase (COIN) wallet to their main Coinbase account to verify that they control the wallet receiving crypto assets.  Coinbase told customers it is making these changes as ""required by local regulations,"" an apparent reference to the Financial Action Task Force's (FATF) travel rule, which requires crypto service providers to exchange the personal information of the senders and receivers in order to tackle fraud and money laundering.  Currently, however, the travel rule is not mandated in the Netherlands, suggesting that Coinbase is attempting to pre-empt the possibility of this regulatory action.  The company declined to comment further when contacted by CoinDesk.  Coinbase has previously attempted to demonstrate a proactive approach to the travel rule compliance by founding the Travel Rule Universal Solution Technology (TRUST) alongside fellow exchanges.

However, sellers managed to exceed expectations, setting the local low at $17,622. Fortunately, the weekly candle closed above the liquidity range of $18,000-$20,000, and buyers have every chance to start correcting the powerful fall wave. There are now two strong liquidity levels in the market, between which the BTC price may hang for some time before the trend begins. This is in the range of $20,000 and $30,000. In such a wide range, the BTC price can be traded even until the end of autumn 2022. Source: https://www.tradingview.com/x/RPqWAD5V/ Therefore, until the BTC price is fixed above $30,000 or sellers push the price below $20,000, planning sky-high trend targets does not make sense. The trading volumes during the weekly candle of 13 June show us the tremendous efforts of sellers who were spent to achieve the result. So the maximum we expect from sellers in the coming weeks is an attempt to test the $19,000 range. This attempt will finally pass the initiative into the hands of buyers and we will witness the formation of a rebound of Bitcoin with the final target of $30,000.

42423060,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy26jxh,1656077358,Dubai Regulator: Three Arrows Capital Isn’t Registered Here,"In the prelapsarian days of April, Three Arrows Capital’s Su Zhu said his firm’s headquarters was moving to Dubai to launch a new $5 billion fund, citing a friendlier regulatory environment than Singapore.  But a lot has happened since, and there’s no evidence to suggest that the embattled crypto fund has made good on its claim that it's moving away from the Lion City.  “We can confirm that Three Arrows Capital is not a DFSA authorized firm and is not regulated by the DFSA,” a spokesperson for the DFSA (Dubai Financial Services Authority) told CoinDesk via email.  In Singapore, Three Arrows Capital is regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore. A company looking to replicate its Singaporean structure in Dubai would be expected to seek registration as a fund with the DFSA.  In order to conduct financial services in or from the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) – a purpose-built financial free trade zone – entities need to seek authorization from the DFSA, according to the regulator’s website.  Read more: Dubai Attracts Crypto.com, Bybit as Friendly Rules Bear Fruit  In the last few years, the DIFC has wooed crypto companies to the emirate with the promise of innovative regulation.  Three Arrows hasn’t registered an entity outside of the DIFC either. A search of Dubai’s national economic register shows no company matching the description of Three Arrows Capital registered in the emirate — although there is an air-conditioning company with the name “Three Arrows” operating.  Setting up a company in Dubai only takes four to five working days, according to accountants with experience in the matter. It would be expected that a fund serious about moving to Dubai would have made inroads after its April announcement.  Zhu lists Dubai as his location on Twitter.  On stage at Crypto Bahamas in Nassau in April, Zhu specifically cited that “energy in Dubai’s digital asset industry is electric right now” as a reason for the move, while his business partner and fund co-founder Kyle Davies said he was “very impressed with the vision of Dubai Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority.”  Read more: Three Arrows Capital to Move Headquarters to Dubai, Raise External Capital  “I expect many leading firms to continue to move to Dubai and contribute to the growing digital asset ecosystem,” Davies said at the time.

I’m Lyllah Ledesma, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights.  Price point: Altcoins outperform bitcoin for a second day. Axie Infinity's AXS is up 14% after announcing it's going to reimburse those affected by the Ronin network $600 million exploit.  Market Moves: Coinbase has launched its first crypto derivatives product for retail traders. The company is hoping to capitalize on a market with $3 trillion in volume worldwide.  Price point  Altcoins outperformed bitcoin (BTC) for a second day as Polygon’s MATIC and Axie Infinity’s AXS posted gains above 15%.  Bitcoin is up 1.6% on the day, trading at around $20,900. Traders are looking at this weekend as another testing period for the cryptocurrency.  Polygon’s MATIC is among the top performers on Friday, rallying 18% on the day. MATIC was trading at 58 cents at press time.  The uptick comes as the protocol launched a product for allowing more private voting in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and announced it has partnered with KlimaDAO (a decentralized collective of environmentalists, developers and entrepreneurs) as part of an environmental initiative. Read more on that here.  Although MATIC is outperforming the rest of the crypto market, it is worth noting that it's 80% down from its all-time high of $2.90 reached in December 2021.  Also surging on Friday is play-to-earn Axie Infinity’s AXS token. This comes after the Ronin development team – which is funded by Axie Infinity creators Sky Mavis – tweeted Thursday that it plans to reopen its bridge next week.  In March, Ronin, the Ethereum-linked sidechain, suffered a $600 million hack. The network witnessed a loss of $625 million in USDC and ether (ETH).  The team has promised to reimburse all users who were affected by the exploit after the reopening of the bridge.  It is not clear whether the AXS price surge is related to the news, because the announcement happened Thursday and the price increase began early Friday morning.  The token peaked at $17.30 after trading at around $14 on Thursday.     Market moves  By Aoyon Ashraf  Coinbase Launches First Crypto Derivatives Product Aimed at Retail Traders  Coinbase Derivatives Exchange, formerly known as FairX, is launching its first crypto derivatives product this month, hoping to attract more retail traders.  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission-regulated futures exchange will launch its derivatives product, Nano Bitcoin futures (BIT), on June 27, according to a statement sent to CoinDesk. “The crypto derivatives market represents $3T in volume worldwide and we believe that additional product development and accessibility will unlock significant growth,” the statement said.  Coinbase said it's also awaiting regulatory approval on its own futures commission merchant (FCM) license to offer margined futures contracts for its clients.  The launch comes at a highly volatile period in the crypto market, set off by the dramatic collapses of Terra’s LUNA, crypto lender Celsius and crypto fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC). Bitcoin’s price has fallen about 56% this year, while Ethereum’s native token ether is down roughly 70%.  Coinbase bought FairX earlier this year to launch crypto derivatives products. FairX launched its futures exchange platform in May 2021 after receiving regulatory approvals in late 2020.  Futures contracts are smaller in size, require less up-front capital than traditional bitcoin futures products and can be used as a hedge for trading strategies for both institutional and retail traders. “At 1/100th of the size of a Bitcoin, it requires less up-front capital than traditional futures products and creates a real opportunity for significant expansion of retail participation in US regulated crypto futures markets,” according to the statement.  However, not everyone sees derivatives as a product suitable for retail traders.

Therefore, those hoping for a bull run should be patient for a breakout. The DMI indicator indicates a weak spot in the bearish trend that is currently in place because the distance between DI lines diminishes.

Charles Hoskinson Remains Keen to Work With US Regulators Appearing in a US congressional hearing on Thursday, Hoskinson said that crypto regulation should follow the model of banking self-regulation, telling legislators &apos;it&apos;s not the SEC or the CFTC going out there doing KYC-AML, it&apos;s banks.&apos; According to him, crypto exchanges should be the ones who are doing KYC/AML for the industry, adding that self-regulation would help ensure that the industry is &apos;following best practices&apos; and would be more effective than &apos;a bunch of different agencies&apos; trying to regulate the space. Currently, the US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) are competing to perform regulatory oversight over the crypto industry. Hoskinson told the commission that cryptocurrencies could perform most regulatory work automatically since they can store and transfer data. He also proposed that Congress should allow the crypto industry to establish a self-regulating organization (SRO) like the private banking industry, which serves as a model for regulation compliance.

Solana’s SOL token jumped 8% after the development team announced the crypto-native Solana mobile phone at an event in New York yesterday. Avalanche’s AVAX rose 8%, extending Thursday's gain as the project introduced a native bridge to the Bitcoin network. Polygon’s MATIC added to Thursday’s run with a 17% increase.  Bitcoin (BTC) passed through the $21,000 level in European afternoon hours, adding to a steady recovery since last weekend’s plunge to almost $18,000. Current levels have acted as a resistance zone for the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, and a recovery above $21,000 could see the asset surge to $22,600.  Bitcoin has seen selling pressure in the past week amid systemic risks from within the crypto market, such as crypto lenders pausing withdrawals and the blow-up of prominent crypto fund Three Arrows Capital, which owes creditors hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  Friday’s recovery came as broader equity and bond markets rallied. Stocks in Asia gained, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng increasing 2.09%, and the Shanghai Composite and India’s Sensex ending the day up 0.89%. The Stoxx Europe 600 gained 1.49% in midday trading, while futures in the U.S. added at least 0.50%.  On Thursday, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the agency’s commitment to reining in inflation, which is now at a 40-year high, was “unconditional,” adding that he expected economic growth to pick up in the second half of the year after a sluggish start to 2022, as per Reuters.  While Powell’s comments indicate higher interest rates may be in the offing, Jeffrey Halley, a senior market analyst at foreign exchange broker Oanda, told clients in a note that markets continued to price in “a recession stopping rate hikes in their tracks much sooner.”  Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley reiterated warnings earlier this week, stating that recession risks were “not fully priced in"" by investors. Citi pegged the possibility of a recession at 50%.  “The moves this week could still turn out to be the result of a financial market genetically preprogrammed to buy dips in equity and bond prices, thanks to two decades of central bank largess,” Halley said. “It could also be a bear market correction as the stampede for the exit door got overdone in the short term, leading to a short-squeeze.”  Powell’s comments came as investors remain spooked by concerns around inflation and supply-chain stresses. Last week, the Fed increased rates by 75 basis points, the most in 28 years, in a move that sought to curb inflation. A further 50-to-75 basis point hike is expected in July.  Meanwhile, crypto traders remain cautious of the current market reversal. “It will be too early to talk about a long-term reversal,"" FxPro’s Alex Kuptsikevich told CoinDesk earlier this week. ""All negative fundamentals remain. Until sharp monetary-policy tightening becomes the norm, financial market pressures can quickly negate bounces in cryptocurrencies.""",POSITIVE,BTC | XRP,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/06/24/xrp-leads-crypto-majors-recovery-bitcoin-rises-over-21k-as-rate-hike-concerns-wane,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3ce7de52394bd9de1617df3f8dd098918e584caa-2935x2202.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The issue was remediated and is being investigated, the developers said in a tweet. Convex is a popular protocol that allows users to earn yields from the stablecoin swap service Curve Finance.  The Domain Name Service (DNS) translates website names that users type into the internet's native numeric address coding. By intercepting that process, it's possible to redirect users to alternative websites that might have malicious intent.  A possible exploit issue was flagged last night on Twitter by alexintosh.eth, with approvals for contracts apparently spoofing wallet addresses and misleading users to approve the wrong wallet actions.  Shortly thereafter, Convex asked users to “review approvals” while developers evaluated a “potential front end issue.”  Some five wallets were flagged by Convex to have been affected by the exploit. Funds on verified contracts on Convex were unaffected, developers said.  Wallet “0xcdc0f019f0ec0a903ca689e2bced3996efc53939” – flagged as “Convex Phisher Deposits” on blockchain analytics service Etherscan – seemed to have obtained small amounts of cryptocurrencies from affected users, blockchain data shows.  That wallet transferred just under $1,000 worth of USD coin and CRV via decentralized exchange Uniswap in European morning hours, the data shows.  Crypto wallets work on token approvals, or permissions granted to decentralized apps (dapps) by users to access tokens in their crypto wallets.  In a phishing attack, exploiters may spoof the front end of a protocol’s website and mislead users to approve the wrong action – granting the attacker access to the exploited wallet and allowing them to drain tokens from that wallet.  The developers set up “Convexfinance.fi"" and “frax.convexfinance.fi” as alternatives for users. “Users are encouraged to use these URLs to interact with the site while the investigation into the DNS hijack is conducted,” the developers said in a tweet.",NEGATIVE,CRV,BLOCKCHAIN | CRV | EXCHANGE | UNI | ZRX,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/06/24/convex-finance-sets-up-new-urls-after-website-address-is-hijacked,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b035bcebbf5348a357c34d15ba57387738402ebc-3353x2514.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

THORChain allows users to trade bitcoin (BTC) for any other supported asset without the use of bridges or wrapped assets. Bridges are protocols that rely on smart contracts to exchange coins from different blockchains between users.  The protocol currently supports swaps between seven major ecosystems: bitcoin, ether (ETH), binance coins (BNB), dogecoin (DOGE), litecoin (LTC), bitcoin cash (BCH) and rune (RUNE). Support for cosmos (ATOM) and avalanche (AVAX) is expected shortly, developers said.  Developers said the protocol’s focus after the mainnet launch would be on integrating with more decentralized exchanges (DEX) and exchange aggregators.  Community members can propose new additions or features on THORChain’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), but node operators ultimately approve which features are pushed live.  The previous network, called ChaosNet, saw some $9.2 billion traded over 3.4 million swaps from some 71,000 unique traders, developers said. The platform earned nearly $80 million in fees from such activity, with a $1.33 million swap being the largest on that platform.  THORChain’s native rune (RUNE) token surged some 40% in nearly 48 hours even as the broader crypto market remained stable.

""The Harmony team has identified a theft occurring this morning on the Horizon bridge amounting to approx. $100MM,"" the network's developers said in a tweet. ""We have begun working with national authorities and forensic specialists to identify the culprit and retrieve the stolen funds.""  The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the domestic intelligence and legal enforcement agency of the U.S., and cybersecurity firms have joined the search for the attacker, Harmony said in a subsequent tweet.  Harmony's native ONE token slumped on news of the exploit, taking its decline in the past 24 hours to more than 12%. This was despite the broader market seeing a recovery, with bitcoin nearing the $21,000 mark.  The attack adds to this year's litany of exploits targeting bridges, which allow users to move tokens between blockchains, taking the total lost to more than $1 billion in 2022 alone. Among the biggest, in February, Wormhole bridge suffered a $326 million hack, and in April Ronin was exploited for $625 million.  The Horizon bridge allowed users to exchange assets, such as tokens, stablecoins and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), between the Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Harmony blockchains.  Harmony said in a separate tweet that the exploit did not impact its bitcoin bridge and that funds and assets stored on decentralized vaults were ""safe at this time.""  The mechanism of how the bridge worked allowed attackers to exploit the network. It worked as follows, as per developer documents: A set of smart contracts were deployed on Ethereum, BSC and Harmony blockchains. A pool of validators verifies when users lock liquidity on any of those networks.  When a token lock action is detected on the Ethereum blockchain, the pool of validators validates it and relays the finalized information to the Harmony blockchain, where a matching amount of a bridged token is minted. On the opposite side, when a bridged token burn is detected on the Harmony blockchain, the pool of validators validates it and relays the finalized information to the Ethereum blockchain, where the same amount of the original token is unlocked.  The attacker did not move any funds to exchanges or privacy swap services, such as Tornado Cash, at the time of writing, blockchain data shows.  Meanwhile, Harmony developers said they had notified exchanges and stopped the Horizon bridge to prevent further transactions. ""The team is all hands on deck as investigations continue,"" they added. Harmony did not return requests for comment at writing time.

The coin is currently trading at $0.18, representing a 97 percent decline from its all-time high of a little over $9 on April 28. To prevent the ecosystem from imploding, the coin must once again attract purchasers like it did during that month.

Gamers were once thought of as people who waste their time playing video games rather than doing anything productive. However, that&apos;s changed drastically over the last few years. Play-to-Earn video games allow users to earn real-world incentives. It embraces an open economy and compensates all players who contribute to the game. Gamers have the ability to &apos;farm&apos; digital assets like cryptocurrencies and NFTs to sell on the market. The worldwide gaming market could be valued at $268 billion by 2025. It&apos;s reasonable to conclude that cryptocurrencies have penetrated this booming sector thanks to the benefits of blockchain technology. By letting developers recognize that they can build and transfer real value in the ecosystem, NFTs have played a crucial role in this expansion. If you look at Axie Infinity&apos;s past revenue and transaction volume, it&apos;s plausible to conclude that P2E gaming models are a huge success even in developing countries, such as the Philippines, where a large chunk of its userbase is based. This begs the question, &apos;Can this success of Play-to-Earn Games be replicated in India?&apos; Yes. Why? There are several elements that make India an ideal market for P2E gaming.

42423056,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy26jph,1656030220,Coinbase Launches First Crypto Derivatives Product Aimed at Retail Traders,"Coinbase Derivatives Exchange, formerly known as FairX, is launching its first crypto derivatives product this month, hoping to attract more retail traders.  The futures exchange, which is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), will launch its derivatives product, Nano Bitcoin futures (BIT), on June 27, according to a statement sent to CoinDesk. “The crypto derivatives market represents $3T in volume worldwide and we believe that additional product development and accessibility will unlock significant growth,” the statement said.  Coinbase said it's also awaiting regulatory approval on its own futures commission merchant (FCM) license to offer margined futures contracts for its clients.  The launch comes at a highly volatile period in the crypto market, set off by the dramatic collapses of Terra’s LUNA, crypto lender Celsius and crypto fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC). Bitcoin’s price has fallen about 56% this year, while Ethereum’s native token ether is down roughly 70%.  Coinbase bought FairX earlier this year to launch crypto derivatives products. FairX launched its futures exchange platform in May 2021 after receiving regulatory approvals in late 2020.  Retail participation  Futures contracts are smaller in size, require less upfront capital than traditional bitcoin futures products and can be used as a hedge for trading strategies for both institutional and retail traders. “At 1/100th of the size of a Bitcoin, it requires less upfront capital than traditional futures products and creates a real opportunity for significant expansion of retail participation in US regulated crypto futures markets,” according to the statement.  However, not everyone sees derivatives as a product suitable for retail traders. Most recently, a senior Dutch financial regulator said that crypto derivatives trading should be restricted to wholesale markets only, citing risks of manipulation and other criminal activity.  In 2020, The U.K. watchdog, Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), banned crypto derivatives for retail consumers, saying that the products are ill-suited due to the risks they pose.  However, large banks including Nomura, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan have already started trading crypto derivative contracts, giving their clients a way to trade the volatility in the crypto market and protect against downside risks.  Initially, the BIT futures will be available for trading via several leading broker intermediaries, including retail brokers EdgeClear, Ironbeam, NinjaTrader, Optimus Futures, Stage 5, and Tradovate, and clearing firms ABN AMRO, ADMIS, Advantage Futures, ED&F Man, Ironbeam and Wedbush, according to the statement.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/24/coinbase-launches-first-crypto-derivatives-product-aimed-at-retail-traders,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c9a8739328ed78c4af9d7417b3704068c29e52f8-6294x4721.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
