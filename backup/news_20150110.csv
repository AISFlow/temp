42398105,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSSiE,1420922081,Bitcoin Makes Notable Appearance at CES Despite Recent Scandal,"Bitcoin made its presence known at the International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas this week in the face of heightened speculation about recent controversies in the industry.  In the days leading up to one of the most high-profile conventions in the tech industry, bitcoin's price fell below $300 and one of the digital currency's biggest exchanges, Bitstamp, suffered a security breach that resulted in the theft of some 19,000 BTC.  Nonetheless, a number of seemingly undaunted crypto companies came together at CES, and bitcoin commanded attention from attendees consistently over the four-day span of the event.  The 'World of Bitcoin'  Bitcoin was only one of a vast number of technologies that were represented at CES, but thanks to an initiative organized by BitPay, several companies in the industry came together – literally – to ensure that the digital currency couldn't be missed.  The 'World of Bitcoin' exhibit was built as a central location for a number of bitcoin startups to showcase their products and services, and from the looks of it, bitcoin's home base at CES attracted considerable attention:    The #bitcoin booth is busy! #CES2015@blockchain@circlebits@Bitstamp@krakenfxpic.twitter.com/ENktZSXZg3      — BitPay (@BitPay) January 6, 2015    BitPay was joined in the World of Bitcoin by companies like Blockchain, Kraken, Circle and yBitcoin, among others.  Though the World of Bitcoin served as a central point for companies in the space, other digital currency startups like HyprKey and Gliph showcased their offerings elsewhere on the exhibit floor.  A bevy of launches  As startups like to do at high-profile conferences, a number of bitcoin companies launched new products and made big announcements this week at CES.  Among these launches were Copay's new multisig wallet app for the Windows Phone platform, Gliph's new Craigslist-like peer-to-peer marketplace and HyprKey's pre-order and demo of its fingerprint-scanning bitcoin wallet.  In addition to the 'purebred' bitcoin startups, big-name tech companies also helped boost bitcoin and blockchain technology's visibility at CES this week – particularly in the form of IBM releasing the draft of its white paper on blockchain technology and its potential use in the Internet of Things.  IBM also kept up its budding romance with the cryptocurrency industry by posing for a picture with Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin:    The IBM-Samsung team gets a photo with Vitalik from @ethereumprojectpic.twitter.com/QHdDFUydkM      — Paul Brody (@pbrody) January 9, 2015    An elephant in the room  Despite the camaraderie among bitcoin companies and the string of new product launches, it seemed as though the shadow of recent happenings in the bitcoin industry was cast on those in attendance at the show.  Just days before CES kicked off in Vegas this week, one of the biggest bitcoin exhibitors scheduled to attend the convention – Bitstamp – suffered a hack of its hot wallet that resulted in the theft of nearly $5m worth of bitcoin, the temporary closing of its business, and murmurs both within and outside of the industry of a possible repeat of the Mt Gox catastrophe.  As a result of the theft, Bitstamp pulled out of its scheduled appearance at CES, leaving its booth empty over the course of the four-day event.    Was sorry to miss interacting at CES this week. Our team is all hands on deck focused on the immediate needs of redeploying our site.      — Nejc Kodrič (@nejc_kodric) January 8, 2015    Also adding fuel to the bitcoin skeptics' fire was bitcoin's falling price. After seeing its value drop more than 54% in 2014, bitcoin's price fell below $300 in the days leading up to the consumer electronics show.  The bitcoin industry, though, seems determined to weather through the storm of speculation, misfortune and uncertainty.  Bitstamp is already back up and running, money keeps flowing into efforts that bolster the industry's infrastructure, and the bitcoin companies on showcase at CES this week did their best to show that bitcoin is something bigger than its market volatility or a scandal or two in the space.

42398109,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSSo8,1420914876,A Bitcoin-Powered Marketplace Could Change the Future of Secrets,"In the modern classic movie Sneakers, a ragtag team of hackers and security engineers attempt to pull off the mother of all crypto-heists – they are hired to steal a hardware device that is capable of decrypting anything. The movie, written and produced in the early 1990s, is oddly prescient about the subject of cryptography and how much of our modern technology depends on its infallibility.  The film’s ending, viewed through the lens of the last decade, takes on a completely new, almost parodical, meaning: the NSA turn out to be the good guys.  Last month, the U99 group announced plans to develop the Slur.io marketplace, a decentralised platform for matching buyers and sellers of secrets. Anonymous sellers post an encrypted version of a secret (along with, I assume, some form of provenance) on the site, and anonymous buyers bid for its decryption keys with bitcoin. Once an agreement has been reached, bitcoin is exchanged, keys are transmitted, and secrets are revealed.  The secrets could literally be anything, and the U99 group has not held back with its examples: trade secrets, source code for proprietary software, proof of tax evasion by major corporations, military intelligence, stolen credit card databases, celebrity nude photos, evidence relevant to ongoing trials – the list, and our collective imaginations, goes on quite a ways (to the avid movie fan, their rundown reads like every conceivable MacGuffin in every heist movie ever made).  U99 envisions Slur.io as Wikileaks 2.0, an “incalculable resource for public knowledge and unfiltered access to the truth"". Except that in the future journalists will need to compensate whistleblowers for the extreme risks they take.  Incentivised transparency  In a world where cryptography currently allows private organisations and individuals to do bad things without fear of discovery, marketplaces like Slur.io aim to incentivise total transparency.  The plot of David Eggers’ The Circle immediately springs to mind. But secrets aren’t always “lies,” as the fictitious social network in Eggers’ book declares. The underlying reason for having company secrets (and in a broader sense, the entire patent system) is because the process of invention is long and arduous. If an invention is not protected long enough for its creator to be financially rewarded for it, then we would have far fewer inventors. Individual reward drives public good, etc.  So if, for example, Johnson & Johnson spends a few hundred million dollars and several years attempting to develop a vaccine for Ebola, it seems wrong for a disgruntled employee to be able to take all that research and auction it off on some online secret marketplace. Granted, the greater issue there probably lies in J&J’s employment practices and security measures, but that’s another discussion entirely.  Worst case scenarios  There is, however, a fundamental difference between a publicly-visible auction and a surreptitious negotiation between two parties in a dimly-lit noodle house outside Tucheng. The difference is this: the rest of the world doesn’t know the exchange is happening, or is even possible. To understand why that is a problem, imagine secrets posted on the marketplace with titles like:  'Proof of Major Bank Money-laundering Activities with Known Druglords'  'Head of State Private Sex Video'  'Google Panda 4.1 Algorithm and Documentation'  Assuming a modicum of provenance, the first two titles above are damaging without even having to be real. The third item has the potential to completely upend the world’s search experience and return us to the dark ages of link-farms and black-hat SEO  Taken to an Upworthy extreme (as essayists on the internet are wont to do), Slur.io could become the Shopify of blackmail.  But there is good here as well. Organisational transparency is generally regarded as a boon, and properly incentivised whistleblowers keep everyone honest. In a 2013 report, Transparency International (TI) scored multinational corporations from emerging countries on their overall corporate transparency. The result was an unsurprisingly low 3.6 out of 10 on average, a result which TI states is indicative of “a lack of recognition of the importance of transparency as a building block of good governance, including the management of corruption risks”.  TI lists a handful of recommendations regarding what companies “should” do (hint: it has something to do with being more transparent), but by their own analysis, the highest scores were due to domestic legal requirements which forced those companies to provide “more extensive financial information on their subsidiaries.” To put it plainly, I doubt it was due to those companies having read the TI report.  Imposing transparency by law does not appear to be working all that well, in any case. As we’ve seen many times, the largest and most corrupt financial institutions are more powerful than the regulators attempting to keep them under control.  In a Slur.io world, transparency would conversely be brought about from the bottom-up. Individuals looking for a big payday would attempt to blow the whistle on company malfeasance at every turn, and the threat of that possibility would likely be enough to force large companies to rethink their transparency outlook.  But the argument does tend to loop back around. In a truly decentralised platform, all the “good” secrets are thrown in with the “bad,” and obviously even that dichotomy is specious at best. The first casualties will conceivably be (a) the right to privacy and (b) the protection of innovators.  Slur.io and the similar marketplaces that will inevitably spring up alongside it are not exactly the ultimate codebreaker that figures so heavily in the movie Sneakers, but the potential impact is very similar.  What’s most interesting is that the fundamental code for creating the platform is already out there in the form of the decentralised, open-source marketplace OpenBazaarhttps://github.com/OpenBazaar/OpenBazaar. In order to prototype the concept, a committed developer would only need to add the fulfilment workflow for transferring and decrypting the “merchandise”. Whether or not it will be better or worse for mankind on average is unknown, but what’s abundantly clear is this: our secrets’ days are numbered.

42398120,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSSyx,1420903100,Neuroware Launches 'Future-Proof' API for Cryptocurrency Apps,"Building an infrastructure that is easy-to-use is critical if the digital currency ecosystem wants to encourage the creation of consumer-facing products.  To simplify this process, startup Neuroware has built Blockstrap – an application programming interface (API) for web designers and front-end developers that supports bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, allowing developers who want to create well-designed crypto-based apps to plug into its HTML5 framework.  Adam Giles, CEO of Neuroware, explained that the goal is to create a blockchain-agnostic resource for those who are looking to build new products and services, and that the project itself came out of his own difficulties building a product with existing resources.  Giles told CoinDesk:  “We’ve got to get more developers building on this. That’s our mission: get more developers building on blockchain technologies; make it a lot easier for them.”  However, Neuroware is just one of many API providers in what has become a rather densely populated space.  Chain  , a San Francisco-based blockchain API provider, recently secured more than $9m in funding to build out its product for developers, and Boost VC-backed BlockCypher is also active, boasting speed and reliability as its platform's selling points.  Change of direction  A graduate of 500 Startups, Neuroware was part of the accelerator's $100k funding of five bitcoin ventures in 2014.  However, at that time, it wasn't focused so much on infrastructure. Neuroware was originally working on a brain wallet product at the incubator’s California office, but the company did what the founders called a ""mini-pivot"" – shifting to providing APIs for accessing cryptocurrency blockchains instead.  Giles said:  “Although it was the brain wallet that got us into 500 Startups, our conversations while we were in the accelerator program led us to expand and tackle a slightly bigger problem.”  The problem Giles is referring to is the tough task of building products using blockchain technology – something the founders experienced firsthand while trying to build the brain wallet.  Neuroware CTO Mark Smalley, who himself has a background as a front-end web developer, began to realize there would be many UI-focused developers needing a platform for easy API access into the blockchain.  “[Bitcoin] is just complicated for the majority of developers,” Smalley said.  Now, with Blockstrap, Neuroware is currently supporting six different blockchains: bitcoin, litecoin, dogecoin and their three respective 'testnets' – the latter allowing for experimentation without actually spending valuable cryptocurrency.  “Because we’re targeting developers, support for testnets is essential,"" said Giles.” If you are experimenting, you don’t want to do it with real money.”  Modular focus  Neuroware doesn’t want to limit Blockstrap's potential usefulness to the aforementioned cryptocurrencies, however. The company believes that there will be demand for many different blockchains in the future.  Giles pointed out:  “You find the different chains have different personalities. We want to give developers the opportunity to play on each [blockchain].”  Because of this, Neuroware has built what it calls a 'modular' platform that will allow developers to work on whatever comes in the future for cryptocurrencies.  Effectively, once a developer has become familiar with using Blockstrap, they will be able to easily operate within its existing framework even as new blockchain-based technologies are adopted in the future.  This way, developers will already have an understanding of the Blockstrap platform, yet will be able to utilize different types of blockchains – if that’s what the future entails.  Smalley said: “We have to be modular to ensure we’ll be able to adapt for the long-term.”  Ripple  and Stellar are examples of other platforms that Blockstrap has an interest in integrating with at some point. Whatever developers ultimately will want to utilize, Neuroware wants Blockstrap to provide, and it hopes the modular stack will enable this.  Crowded marketplace  What’s interesting about Blockstrap is that not only does it have its own blockchain API, but it also features some neutrality for developers.  “The ecosystem needs a lot of different options and lots of different companies,” Giles noted.  While including its own data service on the platform, Blockstrap allows developers to choose from a variety of other blockchain data providers. Currently, it supports the SoChain, Hello! Block and Blockr APIs, although only SoChain can match the six-chain versatility of Blockstrap's API.  The Neuroware founders also offer some value by providing outputs in different ways.  For example, it uses ISO-standard date formats and gives developers the ability to calculate values using smaller satoshis (each being a 100 millionth of a full unit) or decimal-format numbers (eg 0.00123 BTC).  By providing something different, the company is hoping to separate itself from the cryptocurrency API pack.  Giles said:  “If you’re just giving access to the blockchain, you’re only solving about half the problem. [It’s] incredibly hard to add value in the space.”  Gap in the market  A number of companies in the developer API space see places like Silicon Valley or the entirety of North America as the lucrative market to attract development-focused users.  However, Neuroware is currently operating out of Malaysia in hopes of building out distributed payment infrastructure in Southeast Asia, where electronic funds transfer mechanisms are still antiquated.  “There are no payment gateways out here. We don’t have access to Square or Stripe or anything out here [in Asia],” said Smalley.  The founders conceded that getting developers to use Blockstrap would be their biggest challenge. That said, Neuroware believes developing countries in the Asian market may help to define blockchain technologies.  A refusal to focus solely on bitcoin could also be in the company's interests. The recent fervor for 'sidechains', which builds everything off only the bitcoin blockchain, has created a different atmosphere for cryptocurrency in Western markets.  Giles said:  “We tend to be more opportunistic about the blockchain technologies rather than bitcoin specifically. So, it made sense to support cryptocurrencies that operate in the same way.”  Despite what may come in the debate concerning sidechains versus altcoin blockchains, Neuroware remains convinced that distributed currency-based consumer technologies will require back-end support from systems like Blockstrap.  “We saw a huge hole in the market,” Smalley concluded.  Blockstrap is currently available from its official website or on GitHub.
