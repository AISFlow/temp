42421115,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXZUOT,1661471276,Pseudonymous Hodlonaut 'Very Confident' as Craig Wright Defamation Case Nears,"A prominent Bitcoin community member is looking forward to his day in a Norwegian court.  Behind a space cat icon, the pseudonymous Hodlonaut, told CoinDesk TV on Thursday he is looking forward to what he called “the first part of the ending of this thing,” a defamation case involving Australian computer scientist Craig Wright.  Hodlonaut, who works as an editor for bitcoin zine Citadel21, said he was feeling “very confident” after receiving more than 2,220 donations from supporters, roughly 54.2 bitcoin (BTC), which translates to about US$1.2 million. A trial is scheduled to take place over seven days starting Sept. 12.  Wright, an Australian computer scientist, is alleging that Hodlonaut damaged his reputation via a string of tweets dating to March 2019, when Hodlonaut called Wright a “fraud” for saying he was Bitcoin network inventor Satoshi Nakamoto.  Wright even placed a $5,000 dox bounty (in crypto) on Hodlonaut at one point.  Ongoing disputes  The fallout from Wright’s contention that he is Nakamoto dates back years and is not confined to one country. In a separate U.K. libel case, a judge dismissed Wright’s claims that Hodlonaut caused “serious harm” to Wright’s reputation.  More recently, in a case involving podcast host Peter McCormack, a U.K. High Court judge awarded Wright one British pound (about $1.23 at the time) for nominal damages but ruled Wright had presented “false evidence.” The judge could not confirm whether Wright was, in fact, Satoshi Nakamoto.  Read more: Why Are We Still Debating Whether Craig Wright Is Satoshi?  Hodlonaut said the upcoming trial could resemble the McCormack one in some ways, although he expects that Wright’s team will “introduce new witnesses and remove old ones and examine some 37,000 Hodlonaut tweets. Hodlonaut also expects attacks on his character.  After this report was published, a spokesperson for Wright responded:  Dr. Wright is a defendant in the case brought against him by Pseudonymous Hodlonaut who was asked to retract his #FakeSatoshi and other similarly disparaging publications but took no heed. Dr. Wright intends to defend himself against any allegations presented to him in court. Dr. Wright succeeded against McCormack (where McCormack dropped his defense of truth) and expects to succeed against Hodlonaut in due course.  Read more: Craig Wright v.

42373979,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWYbV,1661462446,Markets Should Prepare for Persistent Inflation and Continued Rate Hikes,"St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said markets aren’t properly pricing in the idea that inflation, and thus interest rates, will remain elevated well into the future.  Inflation is likely to be “more persistent than what many on Wall Street expect,” he said during an interview with CNBC from the Fed's annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. His comments suggest that current pricing showing an end to Fed rate hikes in early 2023 and possibly a rate cut by the end of that year will prove to be optimistic.  Tighter monetary policy for longer than anticipated might mean renewed risk-off sentiment in markets, including crypto. Indeed, bitcoin (BTC) and other crypto assets have bounced alongside stocks over the past few weeks in hopes the Fed might begin to slow or even end its aggressive string of rate hikes.  Bullard also said he prefers to “front load” hikes and that raising rates aggressively in the beginning shows the Fed is taking inflation seriously. His expectation of a year-end Fed funds rate of 3.75%-4% (versus the current 2.25%-2.5%) is about 25-50 basis points higher than short-term rate markets have priced in.  Read more: Wounded Crypto Traders Desperate for Clues From Fed’s Big Meeting This Week  As for any hints on exactly what central bankers plan to do at the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in September, neither Bullard nor any of the other Fed presidents who spoke from Jackson Hole on Thursday provided much of an answer.  Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker told CNBC that the decision on whether to tighten 50 or 75 basis points depends on the next inflation reading on Sept. 13. “I think we have to recognize that a 50 basis point move is still a substantial move, so whether it’s 50 or 75 I can’t say right now, but let’s not think that 50 isn’t a substantial move,” Harker said.  While Harker would like to see the Fed Funds rate get to about 3.5%,and then pause and re-assess, Kansas City Fed President Esther George told Bloomberg she believes the benchmark rate may have to rise above 4%.  The main event comes on Friday morning, when Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will make his keynote address. Given the hawkish tilt to the Fed chatter ahead of his talk, it seems more likely than not that Powell will take the opportunity Friday to reiterate his intention to bring the inflation rate sharply lower.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization started the week at $21,518 and was recently trading at $21,524. But Friday should bring some action.  This article originally appeared in Market Wrap, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  On the first day of the Fed’s 45th annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, officials offered few clues as to whether the bank now prefers a 50 or 75 basis point rate hike, which would be announced in September at the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.  In an interview with CNBC, Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said that decision depends on the next inflation reading, expected Sept. 13. But he doesn’t think it’s wise to “rush way up” but instead to “go up and sit for a while.”  “I think we have to recognize that a 50 basis point move is still a substantial move, so whether it’s 50 or 75 I can’t say right now. But let’s not think that 50 isn’t a substantial move,” Harker said.  Harker also said he’d like to see rates go up to 3.4% and leave them there for a little while before making another move. However, Kansas City Fed President Esther George said in an interview with Bloomberg that rates may need to go above 4%.

Meanwhile, ether (ETH) continued to inch upward on Thursday. The native token of the Ethereum blockchain has gained 5% this week amid the confirmation of the long-awaited Merge’s kick-off date, expected somewhere between Sept. 10 and Sept. 20.  ETH optimism could be short-lived, however, and long-term sentiment could soon turn bearish, according to Rafal Tworkowski, a market analyst at forex trading firm Conotoxia.  “With Ethereum set to become a proof-of-stake blockchain at the beginning of September, the ether tokens might hold firm for a while,” he said. However, the token’s technical chart showed ether sliding below its 50-day moving average, which could point “to the downside,” he added.

Featured Story  NFT and Metaverse-Related Cryptocurrencies Underperform as Floor Prices Sink  By Jimmy He  Cryptocurrencies related to non-fungible tokens (NFT) and the metaverse underperformed over the past week as sentiment about the NFT market remained sour.  The Flow network’s FLOW token, which can be used to build NFTs and decentralized applications (dapps) such as games on the Web3 platform, slumped 20% during the past seven days. FLOW’s decline was the second largest during that period among 52 cryptocurrencies with a market cap over $1 billion, according to crypto data and analysis firm Messari.  The general crypto market has stalled amid recent investor concerns about inflation, the economy and the pace of U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate hikes. But NFT- and metaverse-related token declines reflect price and profit declines for NFTs that have occurred in recent months.

CoVaults are self-custody smart contracts that enable teams to fund and pay contributors on-chain with any ERC-20 token.  Before CoVaults, Coordinape users only had the capability to decide compensation for their teams through Coordinape’s “Gift Circle.” Once compensation was decided, someone had to take the results of the Gift Circle in the form of a comma separated values (CSV) file and use an additional platform to distribute funds.  Read more: Coordinape Is Decentralizing Compensation Decision-Making  Now, Coordinape users, in addition to deciding compensation, can frictionlessly execute rewards for contributors on-chain automatically, which minimizes the time spent on administrative operations. CoVaults also coordinates compensation for digital organizations by including fixed payments for salaries, recurring grants and even universal basic income.  Spyder Monkee, a product manager at Coordinape, told CoinDesk that CoVaults are going to be another “nice Lego,” a foundational tool, “to work in these new distributed decentralized and self-sovereign ways.”  Additionally, users have the option to earn a yield on their DAO’s compensation treasury by creating a Yearn-backed vault with DAI or USDC stablecoins.

42373970,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWYOv,1661454275,"Binance, FTX Among Crypto Players in Hunt to Buy Voyager Digital Assets as Coinbase Backs Out: Sources","CORRECTION (Aug. 25, 2022, 20:40 UTC) – Updated to correct the dates when bids for Voyager are due and when any resulting auction would take place. The story previously gave the dates as they were before a revision Wednesday.  Voyager Digital, the lender whose collapse into bankruptcy worsened this year’s crypto market crisis, is attracting takeover interest from some of the biggest players in the space including exchanges Binance and FTX, according to people familiar with the matter. U.S.-based exchange Coinbase (COIN) evaluated a deal but withdrew, one person said.  Bids for Voyager assets are due Sept. 6 in a sale process taking place through its bankruptcy case. An auction, if needed to pick a winner, would follow on Sept. 29. Voyager Digital's native coin voyager (VGX) surged more than 40% after CoinDesk reported the story, according to CoinMarketCap.  According to a presentation from the company’s lawyers earlier this month, at least 22 investors had gone through due diligence and indicated their interest in bidding for Voyager’s assets, so Binance, FTX and Coinbase are likely not the only suitors.  Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, is keen to purchase Voyager, according to industry sources who have learned of the company’s interest. “Binance is excited and pursuing hard,” one of the people said. The exchange is “pushing hard on buying into institutional,” a second person said.  “We have a policy to only disclose deals after they are complete and cannot confirm or deny any potential deals,” a Binance spokesperson said. In an interview with the New York Times published last week, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said Voyager – as well as Celsius Network, another crypto lender in bankruptcy – had approached his company to discuss selling assets. “Our team’s engaging in all of those conversations,” he said in the interview.

An FTX spokesperson declined to comment.  Coinbase’s involvement was in the form of a potential partnership with Callaway Capital Management, a Washington, D.C.-based firm that specializes in distressed assets. Coinbase, the largest U.S. crypto exchange, evaluated a possible restructuring plan for Voyager but backed out after concluding “the financials don’t add up,” according to a person with direct knowledge of the company’s thinking.  A Coinbase spokesperson declined to comment.  Callaway didn’t respond to requests for comment by press time. Moelis, Voyager’s investment bank, declined to comment. Voyager’s bankruptcy law firm Kirkland & Ellis didn’t respond to a request for comment by press time.

Plunging crypto prices spooked customers of lenders like Voyager, prompting a bank run as too many clients at once tried to withdraw their funds. Voyager halted withdrawals and then filed for bankruptcy.  That turned its customers – and those of Celsius – into company creditors in bankruptcy court, forced to get in line with sophisticated restructuring lawyers and financiers as novice participants in a potentially laborious process to get their funds back.

42394848,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWBlX,1661454184,NFT- and Metaverse-Related Cryptocurrencies Underperform as Floor Prices Sink,"Cryptocurrencies related to non-fungible tokens (NFT) and the metaverse underperformed over the past week as sentiment about the NFT market remained sour.  The Flow network’s FLOW token, which can be used to build NFTs and decentralized applications (dapps) such as games on the Web3 platform, slumped 20% during the past seven days. FLOW’s decline was the second largest during that period among 52 cryptocurrencies with a market cap over $1 billion, according to crypto data and analysis firm Messari.  The general crypto market has stalled amid recent investor concerns about inflation, the economy and the pace of U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate hikes. But NFT- and metaverse-related token declines reflect price and profit declines for NFTs that have occurred in recent months.  According to a report from NFT data aggregator NonFungible.com, the amount of U.S. dollars traded in the NFT market dropped 25% in the second quarter from the first three months. NFT resell profit also fell 46% for a total loss of $1.4 billion.  The floor price –the minimum purchase price – of an NFT from Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), the largest NFT collection by market cap, is down over 50% from its high of 153.7 ether (ETH) in April 2022 to around 73 ETH. Over the past seven days, the collection’s floor price slumped 5.6%.  ApeCoin (APE), the native token of BAYC used to vote on governance decisions, slumped around 18% over the past week as investors worried that some NFTs used as collateral for loans through peer-to-peer lending service BendDAO might be liquidated due to the sinking floor price.  The price floors for CryptoPunks and Mutant Ape Yacht Club, the second- and third-largest NFT collections by market cap, declined 10% and 1.3%, respectively, over the past seven days.  Other NFT and metaverse-related tokens that have sunk include AXS, GALA, MANA and GMT, which all fell between 14% and 20%.

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) slipped 0.7% to $21.52K as of shortly before 3:00 p.m. ET, while ethereum (ETH-USD) drifted up 1.9% to $1.70K. Overall, the global crypto market cap is up slightly by 0.2% to $1.04T, according to data from CoinMarketCap. With all eyes on the Fed in the run-up to Jackson Hole, cryptos have acted less volatile in the past week. Bitcoin (BTC-USD), for instance, has stayed in a relatively tight range of $20.9K-$21.7K, down nearly 70% from current levels.

Bitcoin Miners Have Been Withdrawing From Their Wallets In Recent Days As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, BTC miner reserves have been observing negative change recently, something that could lead to a decline in the price of the crypto. The &apos;miner reserves&apos; is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin currently present in the wallets of all miners. When the value of this metric goes up, it means miners are depositing more coins into their wallets right now. Such a trend, when prolonged, can be bullish for the value of BTC as it can be a sign of accumulation from these network validators.

The U.S.-based exchange launched a new crypto policy education initiative on Thursday that aims to provide crypto holders with information about candidates, the regulatory landscape for crypto and the greater political process. It also includes a voter registration tool.  Coinbase, which has repeatedly come under fire for selling crypto surveillance tools and data to U.S. government agencies, says its tool does not collect or store data provided during the registration process.  In a blog post published Thursday, Coinbase Chief Policy Officer Faryar Shirzad wrote that the November midterm elections will be the “most important in crypto’s history” as lawmakers decide how to regulate the growing industry.  “Being informed and being engaged are mission critical for the future of crypto,” Shirzad wrote.  U.S. lawmakers are currently considering several key pieces of legislation that could shape the future of crypto, including settling the long-standing debate over which federal regulator should oversee the market.  It’s unclear whether crypto is a key issue for voters in 2022. According to a recent Pew Research Center poll, the economy is the most important issue for voters, with gun policy, health care and crime also holding high levels of importance.

42421468,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoPmP,1661450412,Tether’s Tornado Cash Noncompliance Is Less Brave Than You Think,"Tether Holdings Limited, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin, USDT, clarified in a blog published Wednesday that it will not “unilaterally” blacklist blockchain addresses tied to the sanctioned cryptocurrency mixer Tornado Cash. The move has been hailed by some in crypto as a brave stance against regulatory capture.  In reality, it’s something a little less. But it is a reminder that if crypto is to succeed, it must be brave.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Earlier this month, the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control added Tornado Cash, an open-source anonymizing service on Ethereum, to its Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons list (SDN). This makes it a crime for any U.S. person to use the open-source protocol.  Tornado’s sanctioning decreases financial privacy in crypto and has thrown a serious monkey wrench into the world of decentralized finance (DeFi). Some have called it unconstitutional, and a threat to open-source development in general. The sanction is something that should be challenged, and noncompliance is commendable while crypto lobbyists, including Coin Center, fight it in the courts.  On the surface, Tether’s decision is a signal that crypto advocates will fight to have their voice heard. It recreates some of the early magic of Bitcoin as a radical break from a corrupt and convoluted financial status quo. But, if you really think this, I urge you to read Tether’s blog.  Tether’s position is basically “compliance … but later.” The firm hasn’t yet sanctioned addresses because it hasn’t been asked. “Tether normally complies with requests from U.S. authorities, being in contact with them almost on a daily basis,” the blog reads.  Further, Tether states that immediately blacklisting addresses “without the verified instruction of law enforcement” could potentially interfere with those agencies’ investigations.  We’re now in a situation where the supposed radical thing to do would be to comply with the U.S. government’s banning of a few lines of code, Tether suggests. In fact, Tether said its main competitor, Circle Internet Financial Ltd., issuer of the second largest stablecoin, USDC, was “premature” in freezing 38 addresses on Aug. 8 because it could “jeopardize” global regulatory efforts.  How far crypto has fallen. Instead of challenging an overbroad ruling on its merits, Tether’s “noncompliance” is more of a justification for government interference in systems that are meant to stand apart and be resilient from the directives of anyone.  See also: What Jack Dorsey's Beef With 'Web 3' Is Really About | Opinion  Of course, we don’t know Tether’s ultimate motivation for not freezing addresses, and its decision to “hold firm” (at least until asked directly) does have the practical effects of letting tainted Etheruem wallets continue to transact as designed. All of this weird rationalization could be for legal cover if it finds itself in court for violating U.S. law.  It could also be a way to momentarily differentiate USDT from USDC, which is quickly eating into Tether’s stablecoin dominance. But we’re already living in a world where the two largest stablecoin issuers, representing a combined $119 billion in value, blacklist blockchain addresses if asked. Tether has banned 702 addresses, and Circle 82, over their lifetimes.  Skeptical crypto researcher and podcaster Bennett Tomlin also noted that Tether typically has not blacklisted other sanctioned Ethereum addresses on the SDN list, so while its decision here may be “aggressive” it is not out of the norm for the company.  The Tornado Cash sanction is significant because it’s the first time the U.S. government has banned a smart contract outright. It’s relevant because almost half the entire Ethereum network is only two degrees of separation from an address that interacted with Tornado. But the reason to support Tornado is because financial privacy is not a crime, and neither is open-source development.  The U.S. Treasury Dept. stated that nearly $7 billion of funds were laundered through Tornado since 2019, which represents the total value of funds that interacted with the protocol. But only a fraction of that amount can actually be tied to criminal actors. The protocol was also used for anodyne and humanitarian causes.  See also: Safeguarding Our Privacy in an Age of Transparency | Opinion  Last week I wrote that DeFi developers should not be criticized for blacklisting Tornado-connected wallets from their front ends. They’re taking on the risk of building permissionless protocols and there should be shared responsibility in building on-ramps.

42411104,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giC8wh,1661449829,Sanctioned Bitcoin Mining Firm BitRiver Loses Another Client as SBI Leaves: Sources,"The bitcoin (BTC) mining arm of a major Japanese bank has ended a previously undisclosed relationship with a Russian miner hosting firm sanctioned by the U.S. government.  Tokyo-based SBI Holdings, the parent company of crypto miner SBI Crypto, said Aug. 15 in an earnings report that it was “withdrawing” from Russia. In a later interview with Bloomberg, the firm’s chief financial officer cited the broad sanctions imposed by the West on the country since President Vladimir Putin's Russia invaded Ukraine in February.  But CoinDesk was told the sanctions bit SBI Crypto directly. The unit was hosting its mining machines at BitRiver, a major mining company with sites across Siberia, which has been blacklisted by U.S. authorities, according to two people familiar with the arrangement.  SBI Crypto is at least the second big name to emerge as ceasing work with BitRiver after the U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on the mining firm in April. The other is Compass Mining, based in Austin, Texas.  Exactly what “withdrawing” from Russia looks like is unclear. Compass Mining has told CoinDesk that its hands are essentially tied, with the company's machines stuck in BitRiver’s facility and lawyers advising it to not even talk directly to BitRiver, let alone transact with the Russian outfit.  Read more: After Countless Bungles, Compass Mining Tries to Change Course  At the same time, Compass Mining – and SBI Crypto, according to its chief financial officer – claim they have been trying to sell their equipment in Russia, but neither would answer questions as to how that can be achieved without their hosting firm’s involvement.  There is evidence, however, suggesting SBI Crypto’s operation has slowed since Russia invaded Ukraine, which led to sanctions. Its mining pool hashrate, a measure of computing power spent on the Bitcoin network, has dropped by about one-third since February, according to data from information platform Blockchain.com.  However, mining pools bring together the computing power of more than one miner, so the number doesn’t necessarily reflect only SBI Crypto’s mining operations, as other companies can participate in the pool.  Read more: What Are Bitcoin Mining Pools?  BitRiver’s case underscores how the global bitcoin ecosystem, ethereal as it might feel to its users, still relies on physical infrastructure that centralized agents and governments can easily tamper with.  Mining companies “help Russia monetize its natural resources,” making them a “mechanism for the Putin regime to offset the impact of sanctions,” the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) said in April.  BitRiver would neither confirm nor deny that SBI was its client, nor would SBI Holdings.  “The SBI Group has already stopped all mining in Siberia. And we are not mining in the rest of Russia. As for any other information, I’m afraid I cannot disclose,” said SBI Holdings in an emailed response to CoinDesk, signed by “Corporate Communications Dept.”  SBI Holdings’ latest quarterly earnings report does show it retains a link to Russia, as it continues to operate a banking branch there.  Low key  SBI Holdings has disclosed little about its mining business, and did not previously mention its involvement in Russia as far as CoinDesk could find. The firm used to disclose basic information, such as that it produced its own chips and machines, in its earnings presentations. In 2018 it said that it was mining in the U.S. state of Virginia and in Sweden, and in 2020 it mentioned in a press release it was working in Texas. Other than that, SBI would mostly talk about mining at “overseas locations.""  Even those disclosures stopped in 2020. Around that time, the company was looking into mining in Russia and Kazakhstan, an industry source with knowledge of the matter told CoinDesk.  In fact, at that time, SBI Holdings stopped mentioning bitcoin mining altogether in its earnings presentations, except in relation to its “environmental” investment in Texas data center management firm Lancium.  The SBI spokesperson would not say why mining revenue was not disclosed after 2020.  The Japanese firm’s presence in the Russian mining market has been a carefully kept secret: Employees of multiple mining businesses operating in the region told CoinDesk they had never heard that SBI was mining in Russia.  That made sense, said Alex Petrov, former chief information officer at Bitfury, which mines and builds mining machines. According to him, publicizing your mining business in Russia could lead to someone – a government official or others – swiping your equipment, so it’s not surprising some companies preferred to keep quiet about their involvement.  “The legal status of crypto mining in Russia is still unclear, so it’s a risk for miners,” Petrov added. “Local authorities might see mining businesses as something illegal and freeze their operations while the legal dispute is going on.”  Read more: Russia to Regulate Crypto, Dispelling Fears of Ban  Previously, U.S.-based Compass Mining moved to stop its operation in Russia and has been trying to sell its hardware at BitRiver’s venue since April. SBI Holdings was also planning to sell its equipment in Russia, too, Chief Financial Officer Hideyuki Katsuchi told Bloomberg.  This is normally the case with other foreign miners leaving Russia at the moment, a source working with mining firms told CoinDesk: Transporting mining equipment to and from Russia is too complex a task, so those heading out just sell their machines to other miners.  After Compass announced its exit, BitRiver was left with two big clients: SBI Crypto and Phoenix Technology Consultants, a United Arab Emirates-based mining firm affiliated with Phoenix Store, the distributor in the Middle East for Bitmain, the world’s leading manufacturer of mining rigs. During a mining conference in Dubai in November, Phoenix announced plans for a massive purchase of mining equipment.  At the same event, BitRiver announced an agreement to provide Phoenix with 300 megawatts (MW) of hosting capacity by the end of 2022. However, Phoenix CEO Munaf Ali would not discuss any dealings with BitRiver, instead pointing CoinDesk to an interview where he said the company has operations in Russia broadly.  SBI Holdings' financial results for the spring suffered from its withdrawal from Russia. In the second quarter of the year, SBI Holdings lost 9.7 billion Japanese yen ($71 million) in profit before tax “due to the suspension of the mining business in Russia, a decline in the price of crypto-assets held, and B2C2’s losses associated with the bankruptcy of some business partners,” the presentation for investors read. (B2C2 is a crypto trading firm that SBI acquired in 2020.)  About 7.2 billion yen of that was due to “temporary factors” such as the fall in crypto prices, leaving 2.5 billion yen as losses that could be attributed to SBI's Russia adieu.  As of June 30, SBI Holdings had 18.6 trillion yen of total assets. Reuters reported in June that SBI “aims to become Japan's fourth-largest banking group.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION | SPONSORED,"Anna Baydakova, Eliza Gkritsi",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/08/25/sanctioned-bitcoin-mining-firm-bitriver-loses-another-client-as-sbi-leaves-sources,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0e3f14a0283819dc500834c01aee4b51758533db-1330x998.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Some of the best ICOs have provided massive returns for investors, and IBAT is getting ready for its listing on PancakeSwap (its IDO). Is it a Good Time to Invest in Bitcoin? The global lockdowns led to financial market turmoil, but that period proved to be the best time for investing. Bitcoin (BTC) dropped to just over $4,000. That shook the market, but investors who bought BTC at the time went on an epic rally in the next 18 months. Bitcoin reached its all-time high (ATH) of $69,000 in November 2021. A massive market crash followed, with BTC losing 73% of its value. The worst part is that many investors expect further downside. The market is very bearish at the moment, and Bitcoin seems to be out of steam to make a new ATH. Bitcoin has slightly recovered since its crash, but it seems that its latest price action is a bounce from the ATH set in 2018.

42421466,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoPlN,1661445769,"If Ethereum Starts Slashing, It Burns","The Ethereum community has of late been thrown into a state of mild disarray by the prospect of transaction filtering both at the protocol and the application layer, brought on by the U.S. Treasury Department’s sanctions against Tornado Cash. At the application layer, major decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms are imposing address screening at their interfaces.  The blockchain itself isn’t affected: Users can run nodes and use alternative interfaces (to the extent they exist) to access these applications. But running nodes is hard, and switching from front end to front end is risky and difficult.  CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter is partner at Castle Island Ventures, a public blockchain-focused venture fund based in Cambridge, Mass. He is also the co-founder of Coin Metrics, a blockchain analytics startup.  These Web3 censorship tactics are not unlike the deep deplatforming that happens on the internet to designated opponents of the regime. Deplatformed with suspicious synchrony from Facebook, AWS, Cloudflare, Salesforce, and PayPal? Just build your own social media, hosting, distributed denial of service (DDoS) protection, customer relationship management (CRM) and … bank.  The government didn’t call it Operation Choke Point for nothing. In practice, you just have to make it very inconvenient for users to access the service in question, and you have kicked them off. If they have to run their own beefy Ethereum node and use the command line to interact with an uncensored Aave or Oasis, the vast majority of users will be de facto walled out of the service.  And the Treasury Department isn’t content with de facto filtering at the interface level. It recently took the unprecedented step of sanctioning Tornado Cash, a cluster of autonomous contracts, uncontrolled by any human. Notwithstanding the awkward questions Treasury must now answer regarding the constitutional feasibility of sanctioning blockchain addresses and contracts rather than individuals and entities, this was an aggressive shot across the bow.  The effects were immediate – Tornado became inaccessible to anyone except the highly motivated and foolhardy. Notably, Ethereum’s largest mining pool, Ethermine, has already incorporated filtering into its block construction.  Read more: David Z. Morris - Nic Carter vs. The Bitcoin Maximalists  Now a curious discourse has emerged whereby Ethereans are threatening to sanction slash validators like Coinbase (COIN) if it complies with the law and filters sanctioned transactions, as the firm surely will. (Brian Armstrong can posture all he likes, but the Board won’t allow him to shut down Coinbase’s massively lucrative staking business because some .eths were mean to him online – they would sooner fire him.) Eric Wall has described the credible threat of slashing “a prerequisite for security and censorship resistance in a blockchain.”  Notable among Ethereum elites supporting the slashing of Evil Coinbase is Vitalik Buterin himself. No surprise that Buterin has signed on to the crusade, as it is he who is largely responsible for promoting the concept in his early defenses of proof-of-stake (PoS). “We will slash the bad people” is so elegant in theory. The drone pilots only intended to drop the precision munitions on the insurgents, and never the wedding guests.  The first problem is, of course, that there’s no actual slashing rule on Ethereum. Any imposition of one – taking away staked tokens from validators – would be contrived and arbitrary, effectively unconstitutional. Now, you might say, as a young protocol, Ethereum’s governance should be malleable, but the stakes are far too high for that now. Ethereum is a protocol that manages hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of value daily. The very defensible DAO rollback (in 2016, following a $50 million hack) caused a mighty hangover that persuaded many that Ethereum was a hopelessly subjective mess, de facto controlled by a small group making things up on the fly.  The desire to simply confiscate the funds of designated wrongdoers is seductive, but completely short sighted.  A newly imposed slashing rule spirited from thin air, imposed against the crypto world’s largest financial institution no less, would be far more damaging. Skeptics could justifiably point out that Ethereum will have completely surrendered the moral high ground, with leadership acting expediently.  So Ethereum’s reaction to nation-state sanctions would be to impose sanctions of its own. It’s an identical desire to the one that drives the U.S. government to sanction so aggressively: to use purportedly surgical financial weapons to fight enemies, foreign and domestic, without firing a shot.  But Ethereum leadership must rise above this urge, which would make the network no better than the system it seeks to replace. One of the distinct advantages public blockchains have over their legacy counterparts is their genuine neutrality. To impose a slashing rule – in such an arbitrary and slapdash manner, with no prior codification – would undo that advantage completely.  An expropriation of Coinbase’s funds as directed by, say, Vitalik Buterin or others in the small community of Ethereum leaders would completely discredit any commitment to neutrality Ethereum has built up so far. Who is to say that Ethermine (or any censoring PoS validator) is “breaking” Ethereum’s rules by selecting transactions of their own volition? What rule? What line in the white paper specifies this rule? If the rubric is instead “social consensus,” how is this measured? Who measures consensus? Does Coinbase get an appeal? In which court?  These questions are unanswerable, given the vast array of Ethereum’s many stakeholders and their many different views. There is no socially scalable way to “slash only the bad people.” In the real world, there are no such things as villains. There are only competing interests. Coinbase’s interest is to comply with the laws where it operates while running a profitable business.  (And as far as constitutionality is concerned, Eric Wall admits that there is no formal rule committing Ethereum to slashing censoring validators, or even language in the white paper to this effect. All we really have are Vitalik Buterin’s writings about the theoretical merits of slashing. The Casper upgrade white paper discusses the mechanics of slashing at length, but does not describe how the intent of an “attacker” might be assessed, and how the community would organize a slashing in response to an ambiguous “attack.” Ethereum’s scattered constitutional documents contain only letter and no spirit.)  The desire to simply confiscate the funds of designated wrongdoers is seductive, but completely short sighted. It’s the same impulse that drives all campaigns of nationalization, expropriation and collectivization. This isn’t working. Why don’t we, the technocrats, suspend the rules, and simply commandeer these resources for ourselves?  Read more: Stop Attacking DeFi Founders for Complying With the Tornado Cash Sanction  Countries that take a socialist turn and expropriate foreign firms for crimes real or imagined always suffer in the long term. Their nationalized industries end up becoming inefficient; no one wants to lend to them (as they have proven themselves unreliable) and no one is willing to invest there either. Securing meaningful credit and investment requires, above all else, stable governance and a commitment to property rights.  If Ethereum protocol elites arbitrarily sanction validators like Coinbase, they could suffer the same fate as an expropriating national government. The very best, most technically resourced, and protocol-aligned firms would cease to work on behalf of the protocol. The risk of theft would dissuade others from investing in the infrastructure which keeps the system running.  Now this is not to say that if major validators impose sanctions-related filtering at the protocol layer Ethereum is doomed. I am not advocating that Ethereum fight with one hand tied behind its back by moving to PoS while spurning the slashing component. Simply remaining on proof-of-work (PoW) – this oughtn’t be taken as an endorsement of any fork – would likely abate the problem. Stake exposes consensus to government will through regulated financial institutions, which are slated to dominate validation, whereas PoW is far more distributed and covert. Switching mining pools is instant and trivial; with PoS, it’s cumbersome. The validator set churns constantly in PoW and there is no hardware bottleneck as Ethereum still uses mostly GPUs.  In light of this state-level attack, I do question the prudence of the rushed move to PoS – empirically dominated, as I previously predicted, by large, regulated custodial institutions. But this doesn’t mean Ethereum could never recover from a portion of its validators engaging in filtering. Ultimately, the question of unfiltered consensus comes down to decentralized block templating as well as production: Both are necessary, but neither is sufficient on its own. Ethereum’s odds are likely better in my estimate if it remains on PoW, but it is not necessarily doomed even post-Merge.  For instance, I don’t buy the argument that the Treasury Dept. will forbid stakers from building on top of prior “bad” blocks, effectively creating a “Treasury Activated Soft Fork.” For this reason I am optimistic: Even if large validators do engage in transaction filtering, others will pick up the slack and include the neglected transactions.  All of that said, winning key victories against the creeping surveillance state does require that protocols like Ethereum successfully resist this overreach while we win the necessary political battles. It’s not enough to complain that you are being badly abused by your government and hope replacements arrive soon. You have to hold them off first, so the political case is all the stronger. A law that is blatantly incompatible with technology and popular will is a brittle law, and one that is liable to be replaced. The greater the tension created by the incompatibility between the state’s interpretation of the world and base reality itself, the better your odds are.  Ultimately, obtaining the financial privacy that we all seek isn’t really a matter of passing or retiring specific regulation. It’s not really about the 1970 Bank Secrecy Act, or the third-party doctrine, or the U.S. Constitution's Fourth Amendment, or the precise nature of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). There’s no magical incantation that will restore our lost transactional privacy in a world of digitized payments; no clever constitutional or legal argument, and certainly no line of code.  Rather, it’s very simply a question of how much we want to reclaim our lost freedoms. Holding off the censor and maintaining the orderly functioning of these open monetary protocols is a necessary prerequisite.  Read more: Nic Carter - The Credit Crunch Is Not the End of Crypto Lending  To achieve genuine change, we must understand that in a common-law republic, laws are malleable, and can and do adapt to new realities on the ground. We do have a new reality: just take Tornado Cash, now twisting the government into indefensible contortions as it attempts to impose an ancient sanctions doctrine on a new terrain.  I’m optimistic that, whether legislatively or in the courts, we will eventually win. But to even pose these hard questions, blockchains have to endure first. Preemptively compromising blockchain neutrality and worse, showing that a small cabal of leaders can change core constitutional rules at a moment’s notice, would do the government’s job for them.  If I were Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen or Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), I’d be thrilled that Ethereum leadership was considering debauching the protocol’s neutrality with a panicked reaction of this nature. I’d be much more fearful if Ethereum leadership recommitted to a truly neutral system that makes the highly politicized dollar infrastructure look like an embarrassment.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | FORKS,Nic Carter,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/08/25/if-ethereum-starts-slashing-it-burns,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/55aa43f0758e874f1c712b2ee882527d8921b396-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394851,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWBoU,1661443318,The Graph Adds Gnosis Chain to Its Decentralized Blockchain Indexing Protocol,"The Graph Foundation, the organization supporting the blockchain indexing platform The Graph, said Thursday that Gnosis Chain (GNO) will be the first chain beyond Ethereum to be supported on The Graph Network, whose token is GRT. The foundation also announced a $9 million incentive fund to help bootstrap the network.  The Graph, which dubs itself the ""Google of Blockchains,"" provides ways for blockchain-based apps to collect and interpret on-chain data. It does this through community-created ""subgraphs,"" which help organize a messy sea of blockchain transactions into a form that non-fungible token (NFT) platforms, decentralized exchanges and other applications can find and use.  The Gnosis Chain announcement brings The Graph one step closer to sunsetting its centralized “hosted” service – which currently supports 31 networks – in favor of the more decentralized Graph Network, which previously only supported Ethereum.  The Graph Network is pitched as a way to decentralize control of The Graph platform – alleviating potential concerns around data censorship and reliability. The network requires developers to pay a fee each time they query for data from its network of “indexers,” which scan subgraphs similar to how search engines scrape websites.  As for why it took nearly two years for The Graph Network to expand past Ethereum, The Graph Foundation’s director, Eva Beylin, told CoinDesk, “We've only supported Ethereum up until now because we really wanted to take our time getting indexers ready, making sure they were meeting the performance we needed.”  Adding Gnosis to The Graph  Gnosis Chain, which is home to the dollar-pegged xDAI stablecoin, focuses on providing quick and cheap transactions for decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT applications. Beylin says it earned the coveted second spot with the Graph Network due to developer preparedness and a Graph-aligned vision.  “Gnosis is very aligned with Web3 and The Graph,” Beylin explained. “They have been a community through and through on decentralization. They've got their Gnosis DAO and they’ve even spun out products that they feel are public goods. So we felt it was very aligned with the Graph vision of enabling public infrastructure.”  The Graph Network launched in December 2020, and the Foundation has stated in the past that it plans to migrate all hosted-service subgraphs to the decentralized network by the first quarter of 2023. Currently, only around 400 subgraphs are on the Graph Network compared to over 24,000 on the hosted service.  To help quicken the pace of migration, The Graph Foundation has set aside 50 million GRT ($6 million) for indexers and 25 million GRT ($3 million) for app developers as part of its new Migration Infrastructure Providers (MIP) program.  “The goal of this program really is to help bootstrap the network for every new chain that we bring on. Gnosis is the first chain that we're starting, but this is the beginning of a six month journey, where every single chain that's currently supported on the hosted service will be migrated to the network,” Beylin told CoinDesk.  Apps and indexers will soon be able to start applying for MIPs grants to support their migration activities.",POSITIVE,GRT,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | GRT,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/08/25/the-graph-adds-gnosis-chain-to-its-decentralized-blockchain-indexing-protocol,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/61719eb53ff3d68a49082d6752ba371902bfb127-1707x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

There have been some rallies that didn&apos;t last long, followed by extended periods of pullbacks that caused more panic. So, no one can say what direction to expect in the short term. But while some tokens struggle to remain afloat, others seem to be making positive leaps. For instance, the ANKR price movement in the last 24 hours has shocked many in space. Related Reading: Ethereum ETH Back On Track Race, Will ETH Reclaim $2,000 again? The token gained 12% between August 24 and early August 25, while others struggled to hold their price marks.

Family offices and institutions also backed the fund, which will cut checks of $500,000 to $1 million per project.  Read more: What Is Web3? Understanding What Web3 Is... and Isn't  Symbolic’s news comes a week after the announcements of a $200 million crypto fund from Shima Capital and a $300 million investment vehicle from CoinFund, a notable uptick in larger fundraises.  “It’s a builder’s time,” Symbolic partner Kenzi Wang told CoinDesk in an interview, referring to the current market conditions. “There’s less distraction. We feel like this is a time to really help the next generation of founders.”  Wang, who co-founded decentralized data cloud Cere, met Polygon’s Nailwal while at Binance Labs in 2019 and the two started investing together. Symbolic Capital was launched as a way for Web3 founders to back early-stage startups, similar to how billionaire Peter Thiel co-founded the Web2 Founders Fund in 2005, said Wang.  “We're still at the dial-up stage of Web3, and there's not enough user adoption,” said Wang. “We want to empower founders to come in and build applications that bring more users into the Web3 spheres.”  Crypto verticals of interest include the Web2 to Web3 transition, metaverse, the creator economy, blockchain interoperability and scaling solutions, and the commercialization of non-fungible token (NFT) technology by brands, according to Symbolic’s website.  Half of Symbolic Capital’s staff is dedicated to providing operational support for founders. The wide-ranging support includes legal matters, product integrations, internal audits, networking with other founders and go-to-market activities. The firm will also offer a data platform that scrapes and analyzes sources like GitHub repositories and LinkedIn to provide founders with market trends and recruitment assistance.  Symbolic has started deploying funds and initial investments include blockchain game developers BlinkMoon, Planet Mojo, and Community Gaming.

On Wednesday, Argo lowered its 2022 hashrate expectations from 5.5 EH/s to 3.2 EH/s. In the half year earnings press release Wall said “the revision to our hashrate guidance reflects our current expectations for delivery and deployment of the custom machines we are developing with ePIC Blockchain Technologies that utilize the Intel Blockscale ASIC chips.”  Explaining further during its earnings conference call, Wall said that delays in the delivery and deployment of Intel's (INTC) Blockscale ASIC chips are due to redesigning of the rigs and current market conditions. He added that Argo decided to push back the delivery of the machines to increase their efficiency, close to Bitmain's Antminer S19 XP, whereas before they were geared towards higher hashrate.  The CEO also disclosed that the firm has cut back its order from Intel. The machines, designed in collaboration with ePIC Blockchain, will arrive in the first quarter of next year, he said during conference call.  The funds the company wants to raise is now lower than the $50 million it had mentioned in the first quarter, in line with Argo's decreased hashrate guidance, Wall said on Thursday. There are some good ""non-traditional"" opportunities for raising capital, but shareholders will be ""taken care of"" as far as share dilution is concerned, he added.  Argo is also looking to sign a fixed-price purchasing power agreement some time in the next few months, once power prices have decreased. This would grant it a stable price for electricity, a major cost for miners.  Argo has so far been paying spot market prices, which have been high due to macroeconomic factors, the company said in its results. This has also meant it can't participate in demand response in Texas, under which miners can sell back their power to the grid at times of high demand, Wall said in the call.

Coinbase introduced a liquid staking token ahead of Ethereum's Merge.  Market Moves: CoinDesk's Omkar Godbole looks at how bitcoin could perform after Powell's speech tomorrow. The cryptocurrency tends to move in the opposite direction to the dollar and weakness in the greenback after the speech could power a buy-the-fact bounce.  Chart of the Day: Bitcoin seems to have formed a bear flag, a pause that often refreshes lower, marking continuation of the broader decline.  This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Price point  Cryptocurrencies are showing gains on Thursday, with bitcoin (BTC) higher by nearly 2% and ether (ETH) advancing 3%. Stock futures were also up as investors await Friday’s appearance by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell at the annual Jackson Hole conference. European stock and bond markets are also modestly in the green, as is the euro, though it remains below parity with the U.S. dollar.  Despite the recent advance, bitcoin appears to be struggling to break above the $22,000 mark. The cryptocurrency has mostly been stuck in a range of $21,300-$21,800 of late after having dropped to as low as $20,000 last week.  “There may still be some nerves after last week's plunge, with $20,000 looking particularly vulnerable once more,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda. “A break below could quickly see sentiment turn against crypto after an encouraging recovery since mid-June.  Looking at other altcoins, ethereum classic (ETC) was trading up 10% on the day and meme coin shiba inu (SHIB) was up 10%. Cosmo’s ATOM was up 9%.  Earlier Thursday, crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) introduced a liquid staking token ahead of Ethereum’s Merge. The Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH (cbETH) will have several uses, including selling and transferring staked ETH as well as for collateral in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.  The Coinbase move comes as the Ethereum Foundation disclosed on Wednesday the official parameters for the long-awaited Merge blockchain upgrade to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. The Bellatrix upgrade, which has begun its final countdown, is set to activate on Sept. 6. The Merge itself will be completed at some point from Sept. 10-20.  In other news, Bitcoin Depot, the world's largest operator of crypto ATMs, plans to go public with a listing on Nasdaq by merging with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) GSR II Meteora at an estimated valuation of $885 million, according to a statement shared with CoinDesk.

The forward-looking nature means traders try to predict the impact of upcoming events and discount the same in advance, setting the stage for more volatility after the event.  That's what crypto and equity markets seem to be doing ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's scheduled speech on Friday at the Jackson Hole Symposium. Risk assets have come under pressure while the dollar and bond yields have rallied, pricing very hawkish or anti-inflation and pro-monetary tightening comments. That has left the door open for a ""buy the fact"" bounce in risk assets subject to Powell meeting expectations or sounding less hawkish than expected.  Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency by market value, has dropped by 13% since reaching a high of $25,000 on Aug. 15, CoinDesk data shows. Wall Street's tech index Nasdaq has lost nearly 6% since Aug. 15, while the dollar index, which gauges the greenback's exchange rate against major fiat currencies, has jumped 2.5%. The U.S. 10-year bond yield has increased by nearly 30 basis points.  ""The market has 72% chance of a 75 basis point rate hike, the third in row, priced in. My scenario that I have been writing about and trading is bullish dollar ahead of Powell, and buy the rumor sell the fact,"" Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex and the author of the book ""Making Sense of the Dollar,"" said. ""So as soon as Powell begins talking, look for the dollar to set back.""  ""I think no matter what Powell says or the Fed does, the market insists on reading/hearing him dovish,"" Chandler said.  Bitcoin tends to move in the opposite direction to the dollar and weakness in the greenback after Powell's speech could power a buy-the-fact bounce in the cryptocurrency.  Read the full story here.

42394842,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWBfd,1661433922,"Ether Leads Crypto Recovery on Merge Confirmation, but Traders Remain Cautious","Ether (ETH) rose some 5% in the past 24 hours to lead a recovery among major cryptocurrencies as Ethereum developers confirmed The Merge’s dates on Wednesday.  The Bellatrix upgrade will activate on the Beacon Chain on Sept. 6, as reported. The upgrade is responsible for setting the rest of the Merge process in motion, with developers hinting that they're aiming for it to happen on Sept. 15-16.  Bitcoin recovered over $21,500 on Thursday morning after stabilizing on Wednesday following a weekend sell-off. Broader equity markets rose, with China stimulus driving growth in the Asian session and U.S. premarket futures pointing to an upside ahead of this week's Jackson Hole, Wyoming, symposium.  Traders, however, said that while the Merge event was likely driving short-term price appreciation in ether, the long-term outlook for the asset remained muted considering a weak macroeconomic sentiment and bitcoin technicals pointing to a downside.  “With Ethereum set to become a proof-of-stake blockchain at the beginning of September, the ether tokens might hold firm for a while,” said Rafal Tworkowski, a market analyst at forex trading firm Conotoxia, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.  But Tworkowski said ether’s technical charts pointed “to the downside” – with ether sliding below its 50-day moving average – while adding that investors were likely to get more upside on Merge-related tokens such as lido DAO (LDO), ethereum classic (ETC) and optimism (OP).  Infinity Exchange founder Kevin Lepsoe said in a Telegram message that confidence about the Merge was driving growth in the stablecoin market. “With more confidence around the Merge, we’re seeing institutions driving a net outflow of stablecoins from lending protocols and thus a rise in borrowing costs,” Lepsoe said.  “Long Merge plays are overextended in my opinion, however, with this rise being more short-term in nature,” he added.  Elsewhere, Ahmed Ismail, CEO of liquidity aggregator Fluid said that while the current positive sentiment in the market was largely due to the Ethereum news, the broader sentiment in crypto markets was “strongly linked” to the global macro-economic climate, “which is currently not very optimistic.”  “Expecting a volatile winter, at least until the end of 2022,” Ismail said in a Twitter message.  However, Andrei Grachev, a managing partner at DWF Labs, took an opposing view to that sentiment, pointing to bitcoin’s price performance as an indicator of the broader crypto market.  “One of the best indicators to the sentiment of the crypto market is the price of bitcoin,” Grachev told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “We are almost or maybe even already at the downside of the market cycle. Bitcoin [BTC] price or market capitalization could still go lower than the current level, but regardless, the upside opportunity is still enormous.”  “Crypto is volatile by nature and there are no actual signs that the volatility will decrease any time soon, mostly due to the size of the overall market cap, which is relatively small compared to other traditional markets,” Grachev added.

42394853,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWBqS,1661433770,"Decentralized Exchange THORSwap to Support Cross-Chain Swaps for Over 4,300 Ethereum-Based Tokens","The developers behind THORChain-based decentralized exchange (DEX) THORSwap this week said the protocol had added more than 4,300 Ethereum-based tokens to its cross-chain liquidity aggregator – a move that allows users to swap them into other supported blockchains, such as Bitcoin, Cosmos, Dogecoin and THORChain.  Liquidity aggregators rely on smart contracts to gather token prices across a number of decentralized exchanges (DEX) on other blockchain networks. This allows users to get better tokens prices on their trades with low slippage. Slippage is the difference between the expected price of a trade and the price that's actually achieved, while gas is the blockchain transaction fee.  Using liquidity pool aggregators has benefits compared to using blockchain-based bridges to transfer funds to various networks. Liquidity pools refer to a collection of tokens or digital assets added and locked by users in a smart contract that provide essential liquidity to DEXs. Bridges, on the other hand, are a tool that lets one port assets from one blockchain to another.  However, bridges are susceptible to hacks due to their operating mechanism, with over $2 billion so far just this year. This is where products like THORSwap help, allowing users to trade thousands of tokens across several networks without having to switch between DEXs or using bridges.  The more than 4,300 added tokens are part of CoinGecko's token lists that are used to access token names and data to input on a DEX before trading. The lists do not include any fake tokens and contain a direct link to check any token's legitimacy on blockchain explorer Etherscan.  ""The benefit of using a decentralized exchange protocol like THORSwap is always having self-custodial control of your assets,"" THORSwap's pseudonymous product manager ""paperx"" explained in a Twitter message to CoinDesk. ""Users connect their own native chain wallets (Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB Chain, Cosmos, Litecoin, Dogecoin and THORChain, among others) to swap assets on one and receive assets on another directly into their personal wallet.""  ""There is no need to create accounts or the possibility of funds being frozen for withdrawal because they interact directly with THORChain liquidity pools to perform cross-chain swaps in one click, always receiving the assets they want directly to their personal wallet,"" paperx further explained.

The lawsuit follows GMO Internet's June 10 claim, filed in New York Supreme Court, for $50 million of losses resulting from Whinstone's alleged failures in hosting GMO machines at sites in Louisiana and Texas and overcharging for power.  The dispute refers to events that started in 2018, but appears to have been exacerbated by more recent developments. The higher power costs of recent months have seen hosting companies charge more for electricity to run the machines. It's a wrangle that has already in part prompted a lawsuit between Compass Mining and Dynamics Mining.  According to GMO's complaint, the Louisiana site started running three months late and had capacity for 385 machines rather than the almost 66,700 agreed upon. The site was shut down in July 2019 because it couldn't secure enough power to operate, according to GMO.  The two agreed to build a new data center in Texas and host GMO's machines there. The Japanese firm agreed to continue giving Whinstone its business under terms that included a lower hosting fee and repayment of its original deposit along with ""loss of profits from by power suspension,"" according to the contract provided by GMO.  Whinstone, which operates the mine in Rockdale, Texas, disputed the facts of events related to the Louisiana site and denied the allegations. The site of the facility, slated to be one of the world's largest bitcoin mines, was purchased by Riot Blockchain in 2021.  Talks to resolve a dispute over losses GMO suffered due to a ""power shortage"" were paused when Riot acquired the facility, according to GMO. Given the decrease in hosting fees, it looked like the Japanese company was asking for $3 million for the power shortage losses, until April this year, when it asked for $35 million, Whinstone said.  Whinstone claims it is owed damages for failure to agree on a new contract, and for power purchased for use by GMO that hasn't been used.

42421462,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoPhF,1661431800,Blockchain Means So Much More Than Crypto,"Use the word “blockchain” in a conversation and the topic will likely gravitate to one of a handful of topics prominent in the news, like cryptocurrencies, the metaverse and Web3.  Theoretical, next-generation technology trends tend to dominate technology discussions. Blockchains have spawned entirely new asset classes for investors in cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFT), and they will power a new generation of innovations built on nebulous concepts like metaverse and Web3.  But the real power of blockchain will first be felt in more conventional areas, according to Kieran James-Lubin, CEO of BlockApps. BlockApps is a blockchain technology firm focused on real-world implementations of the technology to help businesses run more efficient and secure processes.  “You hear something different from most blockchain people. Maybe it’s a personality thing, but I think the greatest promise for blockchain technology is in improving the world as it is today,” said James-Lubin. “It’s less about creating a whole new world on a blockchain for all of us to inhabit, or all of these interesting new asset classes.”  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.  Practical applications of blockchain already  BlockApps looks for transactions where there is insufficient trust and transparency. To start, James-Lubin has found particular opportunity in the food industry, where there’s increased focus among consumers and restaurants on knowing where food comes from.  Using a blockchain, BlockApps can help food producers and consumers track where their food has been and what processes it has undergone, from seed to table.  “We’re starting to see more demand from the consumer side for transparency into what’s happening in supply chains, and this phenomenon started with food,” James-Lubin said. “In the grocery store, you may see labels saying things like product from Argentina or Australia, or organic, and people used to take the retailer’s word for it. Now they want to know what it actually means – which farms did the food come from, what has happened to these products along the way.”  Read more: What Is Blockchain Technology?  BlockApps provides similar services for environmental and social governance (ESG), offering a blockchain application that helps track carbon footprints and offsets throughout a value or supply chain.  In yet another application, BlockApps uses blockchain to help the city of Reno, Nevada, track and maintain information on historic properties.  “In some cases, they had been using sort of an all-email system to keep track of all of this, but now they’ve digitized all of their information and on the blockchain the record is immutable,” James-Lubin said. “It’s an interesting use case that impacts their day-to-day operations.”  James-Lubin points out that there are a couple of trillion blockchain-native assets in the crypto space, but over $500 trillion in traditional assets are still waiting to be tokenized.  Future applications of blockchain in crypto  James-Lubin knows cryptocurrencies are an important innovation of blockchain technology.  “They’re amazing,” he said. “One slightly cynical way to look at it, though, is that if you remove regulation as a barrier, even for a few years, and allow programmable financial services, you end up seeing a lot of rapid innovation – some of it unsavory, some of it fascinating.”  NFTs, though not precisely an asset class, are another useful blockchain innovation, according to James-Lubin, as they may allow for new business models involving long-running residuals to artists, creators and publishers.  Watch: How NFT Royalties Favor Artists  Near-term applications of blockchain  Eventually, much of the world’s wealth will reside on, or be tracked by, blockchains, but one of the first areas to be impacted will be real property, according to James-Lubin.  “Most of that wealth will be land, land titles and real property,” he said. “If you think about the experience of purchasing and owning a home, the way we manage those records on a municipal and state level is archaic. There’s a sense of urgency to apply a more transparent, real-time system to these assets, and blockchain solves a lot of those problems.”  Read more: How to Buy a House With Crypto  Blockchain also creates a useful settlement layer on which to trade traditional assets more efficiently. While publicly traded stocks and some bonds are already easily and efficiently traded, other assets such as private securities and other forms of debt are often traded in opaque and inefficient manners.  Furthermore, the process to invest in private funds and securities is often time and resource consuming, a process blockchains can help facilitate via automation.  “Right now, public markets work pretty well. In the long term, blockchain will be applied to them. But in the nearer term, there are certain niches where there isn’t good market infrastructure, and that’s where the technology will take hold first,” said James-Lubin.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Christopher Robbins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/08/25/blockchain-means-so-much-more-than-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2c2e7fa58b937a8095992c68197ec34d38735b08-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394839,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWBcg,1661424092,Crypto ATM Operator Bitcoin Depot to List on Nasdaq in $885M SPAC Deal,"Bitcoin Depot, the world's largest operator of crypto ATMs, plans to go public with a listing on Nasdaq by merging with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) GSR II Meteora at an estimated value of $885 million, according to a statement shared with CoinDesk.  The deal is expected to close by the first quarter of 2023, a spokesperson told CoinDesk.  Read more: What Is a SPAC? Your Questions Answered  The ATMs enable users to purchase crypto with cash or debit cards and wire the tokens directly to a wallet of their choice without going through a crypto exchange. They are, however, also used by scam artists who advertise goods on eBay or Craigslist, instruct their victims to pay by depositing physical currency in an ATM and wiring crypto to a particular wallet and then do not deliver the goods. In March, the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) warned that crypto ATMs operating in the country are illegal and must be shut down.  Atlanta-based Bitcoin Depot says it has a network of over 7,000 locations across the U.S. and Canada, giving it a global market share of 19.1% according to data from Coin ATM Radar. There are more than 38,000 crypto ATMs installed in almost 80 countries, the data show.  Mergers with SPACs have been a popular way of going public in recent years accounting for more than half of all initial public offerings in 2020-2021, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reported in March. Not all proceed to fruition, however, with some, including the planned $1.25 billion listing of bitcoin (BTC) miner PrimeBlock, being canceled as the crypto market slumped.  The SEC has said it intends to subject SPAC mergers to greater scrutiny, saying it will propose “specialized disclosure requirements with respect to ... compensation paid to sponsors, conflicts of interest, dilution and the fairness of these business combination transactions.”  Read more: UK FCA Orders Operators to Shut Down Crypto ATMs",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Jamie Crawley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/08/25/crypto-atm-operator-bitcoin-depot-to-list-on-nasdaq-in-885m-spac-deal,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3724a19312d40406bb8709c431b0208eaf28df4c-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42394845,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWBia,1661424066,Bitcoin's Pre-Jackson Hole Decline Leaves Room for 'Buy the Fact' Bounce,"Financial markets are more interested in what the future holds than what happened in the past or what is happening right now. The forward-looking nature means traders try to predict the impact of upcoming events and discount the same in advance, setting the stage for more volatility after the event.  That's what crypto and equity markets seem to be doing ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's scheduled speech on Friday at the Fed's Jackson Hole, Wyoming, symposium. Risk assets have come under pressure while the dollar and bond yields have rallied, pricing very hawkish or anti-inflation and pro-monetary tightening comments. That has left the door open for a ""buy the fact"" bounce in risk assets subject to Powell meeting expectations or sounding less hawkish than expected.  Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency by market value, has dropped by 13% since reaching a high of $25,000 on Aug. 15, CoinDesk data shows. Wall Street's tech index Nasdaq has lost nearly 6% since Aug. 15, while the dollar index, which gauges the greenback's exchange rate against major fiat currencies, has jumped 2.5%. The U.S. 10-year bond yield has increased by nearly 30 basis points.  ""The market has 72% chance of a 75 basis point rate hike, the third in row, priced in. My scenario that I have been writing about and trading is bullish dollar ahead of Powell, and buy the rumor sell the fact,"" Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex and the author of the book ""Making Sense of the Dollar,"" said. ""So as soon as Powell begins talking, look for the dollar to set back.""  Bitcoin tends to move in the opposite direction to the dollar and weakness in the greenback after Powell's speech could power a buy-the-fact bounce in the cryptocurrency.  According to analysts at ING, Powell's speech could be balanced one with not-so-dramatic hawkish hint that nods indirectly to more hikes beyond September.  ""He could choose to walk quite a non-committal track; he does not have to make any bold statements at all!,"" analysts wrote in the Jackson Hole preview note published Wednesday, adding that, ""there is a risk that the market has overdone the build for a hawkish commentary.""  Interest rate traders have already boosted bets that the Fed will deliver its third 75 basis points (0.75 percentage point) rate hike in September and continue tightening in November and December. Further, rates traders now expect the Fed's ongoing rate hike cycle to peak at around 3.8%, up from 3.3% early this month. The central bank has raised its benchmark overnight interest rate by 225 basis points this year to a target range of 2.25% to 2.50%, injecting volatility into the crypto market.  Another reason the cryptocurrency may bounce after Friday's event is that risk assets have recently tended to focus on dovish soundbites from the Fed, even if those are few and far between and accompanied by relatively hawkish comments and run ahead of itself in factoring in an eventual pivot to liquidity easing. And the pattern may repeat following Powell's speech.  Markets rallied after the July Fed statement said policymakers might slow tightening at some point, ignoring the willingness to tolerate economic pain to bring down inflation. Risk assets behaved similarly, with bitcoin rallying from $23,000 to nearly $25,000 after the Fed published the July meeting minutes on Aug. 17.  ""I think no matter what Powell says or the Fed does, the market insists on reading/hearing him dovish,"" Chandler said.  QT is the big elephant in the room  Aside from interest rates, Powell may also offer his thoughts on the ongoing quantitive tightening (QT) – the process of unwinding the central bank's $9 trillion balance sheet. The QT began in June and will ramp up to $95 billion a month in September through capping reinvestments of maturing assets. That is projected to reduce the size of the balance sheet by $2.2 trillion by the end of 2024, according to Reuters.  While the Fed hasn't planned outright sales yet, the Bank of England is actively doing so, per Reuters. If Powell hints at a similar move, risk assets will likely see increased volatility.

WonderFi will be selling its existing shares on Nasdaq,  WonderFi, which has market cap of C$82.3 million (US$65 million), has been active in its acquisitions in recent months, closing a $30 million purchase of crypto trading platform Coinberry in July, the week after its listing on the Toronto exchange, and the purchase of crypto exchange Bitbuy in March for around $162 million. Both are based in Canada, and having Nasdaq-listed stock may make it easier for the company to approach acquisition targets in the U.S.  Shamaroo told CoinDesk around the time of the Coinberry acquisition about WonderFi's strategy to acquire nonregulated exchanges that may suffer similar issues to Voyager Digital. Voyager had to cut its daily withdrawal limit to $10,000 in June and is going through bankruptcy proceedings owing to its exposure to struggling hedge fun Three Arrows Capital.

SCB had agreed to acquire 51% of the exchange for 17.85 billion baht (US$500 million) in November. The transaction was expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2022.  “Bitkub is currently in the process of resolving various issues as per the recommendations and orders of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Thailand, which are uncertain in terms of timeframe in resolving those issues. As a result, the Buyer and the Seller have agreed to terminate the Transaction,” Siam Commercial said.  In May the exchange was hit with fines from the Thai SEC for not complying with digital asset listing rules when adding KUB coin, the platform's native token. The SEC also told Bitkub to improve its platform after it experienced trading outages in January last year.

After a 16 % drop to break below the rising channel pattern last week, the Monero (XMR) prices show a relief rally to the $154 mark. And with a bearish candle forming at the retest, the possibility of a downtrend increases. So, will the prices break the 50-day SMA, or a lateral trend will keep the trend trapped? Key Points: The XMR price trend can fall below the 50-day SMA. The 50 and 100-day SMA struggle to give a bullish crossover. With a market cap of $2.75 billion, the intraday trading volume of Monero has increased by 32% to reach $84.46 million.

The downfall comes after failing to exceed the 200-day SMA resulting in a 16% to the $140 support level. However, the prices took a bullish turnaround to retest the $154 level, but the retest rally took a lateral shift with a lack in trading volume. Furthermore, the recent bearish engulfing candle forming with a 2.45% fall projects the possibility of a downtrend continuation.

Currently, only the mainnet executes transactions. After the merger, Ethereum will fully reflect its stake. It also stated that the two-phase update, &apos;Paris&apos; and &apos;Bellatrix,&apos; would occur on September 6 and between September 10 and 20, respectively. PoW Consensus Algorithm Ethereum now employs the same Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm as Bitcoin. Because of this, miners need to verify transactions and maintain network security. It is intended to be sluggish, expensive, and energy-intensive. After then, &apos;a Beacon Chain validator will produce the subsequent block,&apos; according to the blog. The merging transition will be complete when the Beacon Chain finalizes this block. This transition will occur two epochs (about 13 minutes) after the first post-TTD block is generated under typical network conditions. Recently, Ethereum programmers forecasted that Bellatrix and the mainnet merge would be separated by 14 days. September 15 is the planned date for the Merge.

The funding was led by Haun Ventures, the investment firm launched earlier this year by former Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) partner Katie Haun.  Thirdweb offers pre-built, audited smart contracts that serve as a quick-start guide for developers who want to create and safely deploy applications to blockchains then manage the related analytics. Potential uses include blockchain games and non-fungible token (NFT) drops.  Katie Haun is a former federal prosecutor who left a16z in December to form her own firm, with Haun Ventures became a prominent crypto investor straight out of the gate, raising $1.5 billion for two new venture funds in March. Two months later, her former company a16z broke industry records with $4.5 billion committed to its fourth crypto fund despite the global bear market.  “From our standpoint, we haven’t really seen much of an effect on our customers or the developers building these projects,” thirdweb co-founder and CEO Furqan Rydhan said in an interview with CoinDesk, referring to the rough waters for crypto of late. “It’s really exciting, whether it’s a bear market in terms of price or not, that we’ve continued to see strong growth and have been able to showcase that as part of raising this round.”  Web3 development tools  Thirdweb was founded in 2021 by Rydhan and Steven Bartlett. Rydhan was the founding chief technology officer at app marketing platform AppLovin and currently invests and helps develop Web3 startups through Founders, Inc. Bartlett founded social media marketing agency Social Chain and is a panelist/investor on the British reality television show “Dragon’s Den"" (similar to CNBC's ""Shark Tank"").  “We focus on a software development kit for developers who want to build Web3 applications for things like NFT projects and marketplaces,” said Rydhan. “We fill this gap between the infrastructure, which is like blockchains and node providers, and the actual applications.”  Read more: What Are NFTs and How Do They Work?  Thirdweb tools have been used by global brands like buy now, pay later platform Afterpay, and New York Fashion Week, and the startup has a partnership with Coinbase’s NFT marketplace. In the past nine months, over 55,000 developers have used thirdweb tools to build applications, according to the company.  Last December, thirdweb raised $5 million in a seed funding round that included noted entrepreneurs Gary Vaynerchuck and Mark Cuban among the backers.  Other investors in this latest fundraise included the venture capital arm of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (COIN), e-commerce giant Shopify, crypto developer Protocol Labs, blockchain scaling system Polygon, Shrug VC and Joseph Lacob, a partner at storied venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins.

Bitcoin Trades Flat a Day Before Fed Economic Symposium Starts  By James Rubin  Crypto jitters continued Wednesday as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's next public comments about inflation and the economy neared.  Bitcoin and ether traded sideways. Bitcoin was recently changing hands at about $21,500, up a few fractions of a percentage point over the past 24 hours. After plunging late last week, the largest cryptocurrency by market value has been stubbornly clinging to its handhold above $21,000 amid largely tepid trading as investors wait for more clarity about the U.S. central bank's monetary policy going forward.  ""Bitcoin is not at the bottom and the crypto winter is not turning to spring quite yet,"" Stefan Rust, CEO of Layer1 blockchain and incubator Laguna, said in an email.  Ether was recently trading below $1,700, rising over 1% during the same period. The second-largest crypto by market value has been outperforming bitcoin over the past few weeks amid eager anticipation of the Ethereum blockchain Merge, which will shift the protocol from energy-sapping proof-of-work to faster, more environmentally friendly proof-of-stake.  Other major altcoins were mixed with AVAX and SHIB slightly lower but ATOM rising more than 7%.  Major U.S. indexes broke a three-day skid, albeit not by much, with the tech-focused Nasdaq, S&P 500, which has a strong tech component, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) all rising a few ticks of a percentage point.  Markets have been running in place this week until Powell offers some hoped-for hint about the pace of the Fed's next interest rate hike. Minutes from last month's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting have suggested that the bank will approve a third consecutive 75-basis point rate hike, although most indicators lately point to an economy slowing but not headed for recession – moderate enough to merit a dovish touch likely to please markets.  ""Like wider markets, cryptocurrency has been spooked by comments from the Fed, which has indicated that there will be no letup in 75 basis point rate hikes in the near future,"" Rust noted.  Other observers are hoping that Powell will bring clarity to the current disconnect between investors perceptions and economic realities. “I’m looking forward to seeing if Powell can straighten the market out,” David Wessel, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution and a former Wall Street Journal economics editor, told CoinDesk's Helene Braun. “At a time when the Fed’s public forecast is at odds with the market, he knows that this is his chance to steer the markets.”  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Cosmos ATOM +7.8% Smart Contract Platform Gala GALA +3.0% Entertainment Loopring LRC +1.8% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Terra LUNA −2.3% Smart Contract Platform Shiba Inu SHIB −0.8% Currency Avalanche AVAX −0.6% Smart Contract Platform  Insights  Crypto's Growth in India Continues, Challenges Notwithstanding: KuCoin Report  By Shaurya Malwa  Despite regulatory hurdles that Indians face to invest in or trade crypto, they remain upbeat about investing in digital assets and the sector’s outlook, a recent KuCoin survey has found.  About 15% of the population age 18-60 as of June either hold or have traded crypto in the past six months, the survey showed. More than half of those holding crypto plan to increasing their crypto investments over the next six months.  The KuCoin report, which the crypto exchange shared with CoinDesk, follows months of drama about crypto taxes and regulation in India, and amid continued surging demand for cryptos and related services.  As of April 1, Indians must pay a 30% tax on income received from crypto transactions regardless of profit or loss, and, since July 1, they face a 1% flat tax per transaction.  The new taxes have caused trading volumes in the country to decline to a fraction of their pre-crypto tax levels. WazirX, a top-ranked crypto exchange, traded just $1.9 million over the past 24 hours across all its trading pairs, according to CoinGecko data.  Yet, the number of investors, particularly among the younger generation, is growing. In this year’s first quarter, 39% of crypto investors were age 18 to 30, up 7% from the previous quarter. That increase was larger than for more mature age groups.  Some 39% of the investors below the age of 30 were first-time crypto investors who only started trading over the past three months.  About half of surveyed individuals are holding on to their crypto holdings, with no plans to sell or add to their positions.  Hurdles  About 41% of survey respondents said lack of knowledge about the crypto market presented a hurdle to investment, adding that they are not sure which types of crypto investment products to choose. Some 37% stated they had difficulty managing the risk of their portfolios, while 27% said they had trouble predicting the market direction and values of crypto, and 21% were not clear about how crypto works.  The ambiguity in government regulations has also been a key factor deterring potential investors, with 33% of surveyed individuals saying that government regulation is a concern when considering crypto investments.  However, over 26% of surveyed participants worried about hackers being the biggest threat to their crypto portfolio, with 23% of that group fearing that they might not recover their money after security incidents.
