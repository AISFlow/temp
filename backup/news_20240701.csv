30255817,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=627246,1719876615,Market Analysts Eye July for Potential Big Wins in Bitcoin and Ethereum — Here’s Why,"In the financial market, historical trends often offer a glimpse into potential future outcomes and so far, July has historically been a strong month for both Bitcoin and Ethereum, and analysts are eyeing this pattern to predict another fruitful period. A Profitable July For Bitcoin And Ethereum According to seasoned market analysts from QCP Capital, Bitcoin has displayed a median return of 9.6% in July over the years, with a pattern of bouncing back significanly following lackluster performances in June. This year, Bitcoin’s decline of nearly 10% in June sets the stage for a possible uplift in July based on these historical insights. 3/ Looking at seasonality, BTC has a median return of 9.6% in July and tends to bounce back strongly especially after a negative June (-9.85%). — QCP (@QCPgroup) July 1, 2024 Adding to the optimistic outlook, Coinbase analysts David Duong and David Han have corroborated the trend, noting that improved liquidity conditions expected in July could further “bolster” the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears $64,515 Resistance: Will A Breakthrough Ignite A Bullish Run? The aftermath of June’s sell-offs has cleansed the market of excess positions, potentially paving the way for more stable and positive price movements. Moreover, the trading volumes for Bitcoin and Ethereum, encompassing both spot and futures across global exchanges, have witnessed a dip from $90 billion in May to $75 billion in June. This consolidation in trade volumes is seen as setting a healthier stage for the next wave of market activity, according to the analysts.. The positive July seasonality is not just a pattern observed in the top cryptocurrencies but is also underpinned by broader market dynamics. Analysts like Ali have pointed out that the recovery patterns post-June slumps particularly indicate “strong bounce back” in July performances historically. Historically, when #Bitcoin has had a negative June, it tends to bounce back strongly in July. In fact, $BTC has shown an average return of 7.98% and a median return of 9.60% during this month. pic.twitter.com/fJaIwc7Eob — Ali (@ali_charts) June 30, 2024 This has been particularly true for Bitcoin, which has shown an average return of nearly 8% during this month. BTC Current Market Performance It is worth noting that the setup for a bullish July is further supported by the technical analysis of Bitcoin’s recent price movements. In the past 24 hours alone, Bitcoin has surged by 2.7% currently trading at $63,104, marking a promising start to the month. This recent uptick has pushed its weekly gains to a similar 2.7%, reflecting growing investor confidence. Despite these historical and current positive indicators, the predictions aren’t without their challenges. Market conditions, including macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments could still influence crypto prices in a way not expected.

According to the SEC's complaint, Silvergate and its former CFO Antonio Martino had misrepresented the company's financial condition during a liquidity crisis and bank run following FTX's collapse. The complaint also added that Silvergate's former CEO Alan Lane and former chief risk officer Kathleen Fraher had misled investors in stating that the company had an effective BSA/AML compliance program. It had conducted an ongoing monitoring of its high-risk crypto customers, including FTX. However, Silvergate's automated transaction monitoring system failed to monitor over $1 trillion of transactions by its customers on Silvergate Exchange Network, its payments platform. The SEC estimated that Silvergate allegedly failed to detect about $9 billion in suspicious transfers among FTX and its related entities. Rather than tell investors about the serious deficiences in its compliance programs during the collapse of FTX, they doubled down in a way that misled investors about the soundness of the programs, said Gurbir Grewal, director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. The complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charged the company, Lane, and Fraher with negligence-based fraud and Silvergate with violating certain reporting, internal accounting control, and books-and-records provisions. The SEC also charged Martino with violating certain of the antifraud and book-and-records provisions of the federal securities laws, and with aiding and abetting certain of Silvergate's violations. Apart from Martino, all charged parties have since agreed to settle SEC's charges. Silvergate agreed to a final judgement to pay $50 million civil penatly and imposing a permanent injunction to settle the charges, without admitting or denying allegations. Lane and Fraher also settled charges under the same terms, along with a five-year officer-and-director bars, and civil penalties of $1 million and $250,000, respectively. Press release.

30252858,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=627212,1719871200,Bitcoin Analyst Says Coin Overvalued: Why Is This BTC Chart Super Bullish?,"Bitcoin is trending higher at spot rates, breaching $63,000 on June 30 before recoiling. Even though momentum is building, the action of the coin’s price is a source of debate. Still, some are doubtful, thinking there is reason for a possible overvaluation. Analyst: Bitcoin Is Overvalued, Here’s Why In a post on X, one analyst argues that the coin may likely cool off, extending the 18% drop registered in June. To conclude this, the analyst said the preview factored in several parameters, including time, the number of active Bitcoin addresses, and hash rate. Through this model, the analyst said there was reason to doubt the uptrend, dampening the spirits of optimistic holders expecting bulls to push on. As of writing, Bitcoin is back in the multi-week range with caps at all-time highs and support at $56,800 registered in May. Related Reading: Ethereum Goes Budget-Friendly: Transaction Fees Drop To Lowest Since 2016 From price action, it is clear that buyers are in charge, at least from a top-down preview. Despite the lower lows, especially in May when prices breached $60,000, bulls have a chance from a top-down preview. Notably, prices are inside a bull flag after gains in Q1 2024. However, buyers’ failure to confirm gains in mid-March is slowing down the uptrend. Buyers have failed to breach $74,000 from the daily chart, and $72,000 is a strong liquidation line. In the short term, the trend could shift if prices break out decisively above $66,000, preferably at the back of rising trading volume. Germany Selling As BTC Gains Versus M1 Money Supply In The United States Further fueling concerns is the recent dump by the German government. On July 1, they transferred 1,500 BTC, worth over $94 million. Lookonchain data shows 400 BTC were sent to three exchanges, including Bitstamp. Though it is not immediately clear if they sold, sending them to exchange means they are keen on offloading them–a net bearish. The address associated with the German government currently holds over 44,000 BTC worth more than $2.5 billion at spot rates. Even amid these concerns, others are bullish on BTC. Citing the relationship between the United States M1 money supply and BTC prices, one analyst said the coin is priming for major gains. Looking at the chart, the analyst argues that Bitcoin has not reached a new all-time high relative to the United States M1 money supply in over six years.

Trader Makes 307x From Solana Token But Investors Raise The Alarm,"Over the weekend, a crypto trader turned 70 SOL into $3 million with a Solana-based token. However, the investor’s success story was overshadowed by the controversial launch of the memecoin that made it possible. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) Price Rallies: Can It Break Through the $30 Barrier? Trader Makes $3 Million In Minutes A crypto trader made millions in 30 minutes after investing $9,923 in Solana-based memecoin BAKED. Lookonchain reported that a sniper spent 70 SOL to buy 81.78 million BAKED. 30 minutes later, the trader sold his holdings for 21,581 SOL, worth around $3.06 million, in 76 transactions. The feat was achieved by a seemingly “lucky” trader who previously invested and lost money in other Solana memecoins. The on-chain analysis platform concluded that the investor was likely not an insider as it had bought the tokens from Raydium’s pool instead of the Degen Fund. However, Lookonchain revealed that BAKED’s team and insiders hold over 70% of the supply. Per the report, the dev wallet spent 11.82 SOL to buy 300.72 million BAKED from the Degen Fund, where the token was launched. The wallet bought the Solana memecoin “while minting tokens and 206.9M $BAKED was added to liquidity.” 19 wallets snatched up the remaining 492.37 million tokens in one second. These wallets were created simultaneously with the dev wallet and were funded by Bitget. 15 out of 19 wallets withdrew SOL from Bitget three days ago and are suspected to be linked to BAKED’s team and insiders. As a result, 78% of the supply, worth around $15.6 million, was held by insider and dev-related wallets. The wallets spent 82.4 SOL, around $11,700, to buy 779.85 million BAKED before selling. At the time of Lookonchain’s report, the insiders had sold a small portion of their tokens and still held 76.36% of the supply. BAKED has plummeted by 58% in the last 24 hours, currently trading for $0.01260. Is The New Solana Token Launch Baked Or Burned? Crypto investors refuted the claims that the “lucky” sniper was not an insider and expressed discontent with the Solana memecoin launch. Additionally, users have called the BAKED token a scam due to an alleged lack of transparency. GUMMY investors were supposed to earn a 15% reward on BAKED tokens for staking their tokens on July 1. However, users reported they did not receive any reward after unstaking their holdings. According to Web3 Forensics, users successfully unstaked their GUMMY tokens but no investor had been able to get BAKED rewards by Monday morning. One investor considers the project’s team “held our $GUMMY hostage so we couldn’t profit off of the $BAKED launch.” Moreover, many users highlighted that GUMMY’s value has significantly decreased since they staked their holdings. Per the reports, every $1,000 staked in the token is now worth around $140. Many believe that the team behind the Solana-based tokens, including Crypto Banter’s founder Ran Neuner, used “every single investor or Community Member who trusted you.” On the official telegram group chat for the token, the team asked investors to “calm down” and “relax.” The team assured the project was not a scam and explained that none of them “got an early entry.” Moreover, the message stated that a higher price for the token meant a “better valuation for your gummy airdrop” and that the airdrop details would be announced soon.

The SEC also charged Silvergate's former executives. Former CEO Alan Lane and former COO Kathleen Fraher agreed to settlements, while former CFO Antonio Martino denied the charges.  Silvergate Capital Corp., parent of the crypto-friendly bank whose 2023 collapse amplified the industry's banking crisis, has agreed to pay $63 million to settle U.S. and California regulators' accusations of internal management failings and the disclosure of bad information to investors.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Silvergate Capital Corporation, the parent company to crypto-friendly Silvergate Bank, former CEO Alan Lane, former COO Kathleen Fraher and former CFO Antonio Martino on Monday, alleging the bank misled the public and shareholders about having an effective Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering program when it didn't. The Federal Reserve and California's Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) similarly brought charges against the La Jolla, California-based lender.  Silvergate, Lane and Fraher agreed to settlements where they neither admit to nor deny the SEC's allegations, but will pay penalties, and the two individuals agreed to a five-year ban on being officers or directors of another public company. Silvergate also settled with both the Fed and DFPI.  Silvergate's penalties included $43 million from the Fed and $20 million from the California regulator, which had also cited deficiencies in how the bank kept track of internal transactions. The SEC imposed its own $50 million fine, too, but it wasn't expected to add to the total. The settlements are subject to court approval, and the SEC said in its press release that any monetary penalty owed it might be offset by whatever Silvergate pays to the banking regulators.  Martino, the former chief financial officer, denied the allegations through a statement from his attorneys, saying those accusations are tied to a single quarter in 2022, and pertain to ""judgement-driven"" decisions.  ""On several occasions prior to November 2022, Lane and Fraher – and through them SCC – became aware that the Bank had serious deficiencies in its BSA/AML compliance program,"" the complaint said. ""In addition, through the results of multiple examinations of Silvergate by the Federal Reserve, through the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (the 'FRBSF'), Lane and Fraher should have known that there existed critical deficiencies in the Bank’s BSA/AML compliance program.""  As part of its complaint, the SEC alleged that Silvergate failed to detect nearly $9 billion worth of suspicious transfers by major customer FTX, which filed for bankruptcy in November 2022.  ""For most of 2021 and 2022, the Bank had not conducted appropriate automated monitoring of its preeminent product, the 'Silvergate Exchange Network' (the 'SEN'),"" the complaint said. ""The SEN was a key mechanism for the Bank’s crypto asset customers to transfer funds amongst themselves and was tailormade to attract crypto asset customers. But the Bank failed to adequately or automatically monitor for suspicious activity approximately $1 trillion in banking transactions that occurred on the SEN.""  Silvergate's team received word from its government examiners that its efforts were inadequate, the suit alleged, but it still claimed that there were no risk factors in its quarterly or annual reporting (10-Q and 10-K forms).  A 2021 quarterly filing did ""acknowledge"" that the bank faced a ""heightened risk"" due to some of its crypto customers, but the bank did not disclose that its executives had been made aware of specific deficiencies tied to its Bank Secrecy Act compliance.  A Silvergate spokesperson told CoinDesk the settlements are part of the bank's ongoing efforts to wind down.  ""In early March 2023, Silvergate made a responsible decision to liquidate voluntarily and without government assistance. As of November 2023, all deposits had been repaid to banking customers and Silvergate ceased banking operations soon after. The settlements announced today, which will facilitate the surrender of Silvergate's bank charter, are part of the Bank's continued orderly wind down and successfully conclude investigations by the Federal Reserve, DFPI and SEC,"" the spokesperson said in an emailed statement.  Read More: The Rise and Fall of Silvergate’s Crypto Business  Voluntary liquidation  Silvergate, which had been the go-to bank for major crypto businesses, voluntarily folded under the pressure of the sector's epic headwinds and was the first of three technology-tied lenders to be shuttered during that period's so-called crypto winter. The other two — Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank — were seized and liquidated by U.S. authorities, while Silvergate had moved to wind itself down without government intervention or a need for federal help to pay back depositors.  The loss of Silvergate and the other two institutions touched off months of U.S. banking mayhem that also left digital assets companies scrambling for hard-to-find financial relationships as crypto fell further out of favor.  Silvergate had experienced a rapid rise from being a tiny community bank to becoming the digital assets sector's leading financial partner, but its descent was even faster. The end was tied to a March 2023 securities filing disclosing that the firm, which had bet its future on the crypto industry, accelerated sales of securities to raise cash to repay advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco. But the warning signs had been there previous to that as the institution lost more than $8 billion in deposits from its crypto customers in the final months of 2022.  The Federal Reserve's inspector general concluded in an October 2023 report that Silvergate's management had been ""ineffective,"" and its minders from the federal regulator failed to adjust to what was going on with the business.

Echoing this optimism, another analyst has affirmed that Cardano may have hit its bottom and could be on the verge of rebounding to $0.8. Analyst Declares Cardano’s Price Bottom In an X (formerly Twitter) post on June 29, Captain Faibik, a crypto analyst, shared insights on Cardano’s price action and future outlook. According to the analyst, Cardano’s native token, ADA, is forming a falling wedge pattern on the daily time frame chart. Related Reading: XRP Dominance: Pundit Says Missing This Altcoin Could Be A Big Mistake A falling wedge pattern is a unique technical formation that signals the end of a consolidation phase and the beginning of a potential reversal or continuation pattern. This falling wedge formation often indicates that a cryptocurrency has hit its bottom or swing low in a market, and is seen as a bullish indicator. Sharing a price chart of Cardano from September 2023 to August 2024, Faibik predicted that Cardano would be breaking out of its price correction soon. The analyst has foreseen a 72.84% surge from the cryptocurrency’s current price. As a result, Faibik has urged Cardano investors to keep an eye on this crucial area. Sharing a similar sentiment, another crypto analyst identified as ‘Zayk Charts’ on X has also unveiled the unique falling wedge pattern on Cardano’s chart. In his case, he foresees a substantial breakout between 40% to 50% for Cardano. Cardano Rebound Potential Tied To Crucial Level If Cardano breaks out of the falling wedge pattern, it could surge to nearly $0.8. A crypto analyst identified as ‘Crypto Feras has revealed a crucial support level that Cardano must maintain to secure its anticipated bullish rebound. In his price chart, Crypto Feras highlighted Cardano’s latest price actions, marking the critical support level at $0.4251 with a yellow box. The analyst warned that if Cardano fails to hold this level, it could experience another sharp decline, potentially pushing its current price to new lows at $0.24. Since the beginning of the year, the price of Cardano has been on a major downward trend, experiencing constant declines in both favorable market conditions and high volatility. While other altcoins like Solana and Ethereum have surged considerably, Cardano underperforms, consistently maintaining a price below $1.

42417839,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTa3Dx,1719862787,"Bitcoin's Bottom in Price Could Be Near or Already In, the Coinbase Premium Index Suggests","Bitcoin's price premium on Coinbase has plummeted to negative levels rarely seen, CryptoQuant data showed.  Similar readings in November 2022 and August 2023 foreshadowed imminent local price bottoms and subsequent rallies.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} is trading at a deep discount on crypto exchange Coinbase, which could be a sign that the largest crypto asset's price is bottoming foreshadowing the next leg higher.  ""Always darkest before the dawn,"" asked David Lawant, head of research at institutional crypto trading platform FalconX, in an X post. ""The last time the Coinbase premium was this negative was a couple of months before the massive rally from Oct '23 to March '24,"" he added.  The so-called ""Coinbase Premium Index"" measures the price difference for bitcoin on Coinbase, widely used by U.S. users and many institutional market participants, compared to the off-shore Binance, the leading exchange by trading volume and popular among retail users.  The metric has been negative for an extended period during June and most of May, echoing last year's market lull in August and September, according to data from analytics firm CryptoQuant. On Friday, it slid to nearly -0.19, its lowest reading on the daily timeframe since the November 2022 collapse of crypto exchange FTX.  Such negative readings suggest weak demand and selling pressure from U.S. investors, as bitcoin has been consolidating range-bound since March's all-time highs. Investors have also grown concerned about outflows from the U.S.-listed spot BTC exchange-traded funds – many of which use Coinbase for settlements – and the U.S. government selling seized assets through Coinbase, which might have contributed to the price discount on Coinbase.  Read more: Bitcoin and Crypto Closing Out Lame Quarter and One Analyst Believes More Pain Could Be in Store  However, such a deeply negative Coinbase Premium previously appeared near to local bottoms in price, followed by significant rallies in the coming months.  The early November 2022 reading coincided with the bear market low for BTC at below $16,000, with prices later surging to nearly $25,000 by February. That was a more than 50% rally.  The August 2023 low in the premium occurred a couple weeks before bitcoin hit a local bottom around $25,000. Then, BTC traded range-bound until October to almost double in price by January driven by anticipation for the upcoming U.S. bitcoin ETFs, and later to new all-time highs.  Most recently, the metric spiked to similarly low levels (-0.17) during the May 1 capitulation to $56,000, from where BTC rallied about 27% to near $72,000 in June before faltering.  ""At least recently, the Coinbase premium has become a reliable, confirming, and sometimes even leading indicator of overall market trends,"" Lawant told CoinDesk in a direct message. ""This underscores the significant influence of the U.S. market in determining market price formation.""  Given that several upcoming catalysts are U.S.-centric – such as ETF flows, U.S. monetary policy and the presidential election, he said he expects this trend to continue.

30246730,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=627233,1719860403,Mt. Gox’s Bitcoin Dump: How Will The $9 Billion Sell-Off Affect BTC’s Price?,"Defunct Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has finally announced the final date to begin refunding Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) to affected customers, starting as early as this week. This eagerly awaited announcement has raised concerns within the cryptocurrency community regarding the potential contribution of these customers to ongoing selling pressure in the Bitcoin market. Experts Confident In Absorbing Potential Mt. Gox Sell-Off While some analysts express apprehensions about potential losses in Bitcoin, they generally agree that any sell-off concerns related to Mt. Gox will likely be contained and short-lived. Lennix Lai, chief commercial officer (CCO) of crypto exchange OKX, believes that many of Mt. Gox’s early users and creditors are long-term Bitcoin enthusiasts who are less likely to sell their entire Bitcoin holdings immediately. Drawing comparisons to previous sell-offs related to law enforcement actions, such as the Silk Road case, Lai highlights that they did not result in sustained catastrophic price drops. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) Price Rallies: Can It Break Through the $30 Barrier? Experts, including Jacob Joseph, a research analyst at CCData, suggest that the markets have sufficient liquidity to absorb any possible mass-market sell-off. Joseph explains that many of Mt. Gox’s creditors may opt to receive early repayment by accepting a 10% reduction on their holdings, which would reduce the overall selling pressure. Recent price movements indicate that the temporary impact of Mt. Gox repayments may already be factored into the market, further supporting the view that the potential selling pressure could be mitigated. Varied Recipients And Time Element Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy Digital, believes that fewer coins will be distributed than anticipated, resulting in less sell pressure than expected. However, Thorn acknowledges that even if only 10% of the distributed Bitcoin is sold, it could still have a market impact. Thorn points out that most individual creditors deposit their coins directly into trading accounts, making them easily sellable. Vijay Ayyar, head of consumer growth for Asia-Pacific at crypto exchange Gemini, suggests that the overall impact of the Mt. Gox disbursement is likely to be dissipated due to the varied recipients of the funds. Individual holders will receive their Bitcoin immediately, while a significant amount will be disbursed to claims funds, which will then be distributed to their limited partners. Ayyar mentions that this process could take time, adding a time element to the impact on price. Bitcoin Price Predictions For July As the cryptocurrency market enters the month of July, analysts are offering insights into Bitcoin’s price prospects based on historical trends and technical analysis. Notably, Ali Martinez suggests that Bitcoin has historically exhibited a strong rebound in July following a negative performance in June. Martinez highlights that during this month, Bitcoin has shown an average return of 7.98% and a median return of 9.60%. Martinez also emphasizes that Bitcoin currently demonstrates robust support at $61,100, which could serve as a crucial level for price stability. On the other hand, the analyst identifies $64,050 and $66,250 as the most important resistance areas. Breaking through these resistance levels is pivotal for Bitcoin’s potential to retest its all-time high of $73,700 in March of this year. Related Reading: Ethereum Goes Budget-Friendly: Transaction Fees Drop To Lowest Since 2016 Supporting this view, another technical analyst, Rekt Capital, suggests that Bitcoin exhibits favorable price action to form a cluster at the Range Low of $60,600. This clustering effect, according to the analyst, could develop throughout July. This cluster formation aims to prepare for a potential rally back to the Range High at $71,500. When writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market trades at $62,630, up 2% in the 24-hour time frame.

42417865,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTa58f,1719860077,Bitcoin 2.0: Seeking Alpha,"While spot ETFs have dominated the headlines, other innovative indices and products are also being launched. Spot ETFs provide beta exposure to an asset, but what are the alternative ways to access bitcoin beyond beta?  Recently, AMINA Group and CoinDesk Indices launched the AMINA CoinDesk BTC Momentum Index (Ticker: BTIAMINA), which aims to provide dynamic exposure to bitcoin by shifting to cash (USD) when price trends are unfavorable.  BTIAMINA measures the performance of a strategy that dynamically allocates between exposure to bitcoin and cash based on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Trend Indicator (BTI), a quantitative signal which conveys the presence, direction, and strength of the trend in the price of bitcoin using a purpose-built algorithm.  The chart below showcases a BTIAMINA backtest against the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX) from 1/1/2018 to 6/27/2024.  Key features of the AMINA CoinDesk BTC Momentum Index include:  Investment Universe: The index allocates between bitcoin and cash, providing flexibility in response to market conditions.  Rebalancing Frequency: Weekly rebalancing ensures timely adjustments based on market trends.  Momentum-Based Signals: BTI uses four moving average pairs to generate trend signals. The final signal is an average of these pairs, which the index then uses in a dynamic allocation strategy ranging from 0% to 100% bitcoin exposure.  Risk Management: Designed to reduce sharp drawdowns and mental biases associated with bitcoin investing, aiming for higher risk-adjusted returns.  Transparency: Fully transparent and systematic methodology, ensuring clarity and trust for investors.  “Partnering with industry leader CoinDesk Indices to launch the BTIAMINA is a landmark development for the broader crypto investment community,” said Gregory Mall, Head of Investment Products & Solutions at AMINA Bank. “This index is a testament to our commitment to innovation and excellence in the digital asset space. We are providing professional investors with a sophisticated tool to navigate the complexities of the bitcoin market with greater confidence and precision. The BTIAMINA Index not only aims to enhance risk-adjusted returns but also reduces the psychological hurdles associated with direct bitcoin investments.”  For more details on the BTIAMINA Index visit the website.

30243778,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=627167,1719855030,"Shiba Inu ‘Underbought,’ While Bitcoin ‘Overbought’ Recently: Santiment","According to this metric, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has revealed Shiba Inu has been underbought recently, while Bitcoin is overbought. MVRV Z-Score Suggests Shiba Inu Has Been Undervalued Recently In a new post on X, Santiment has discussed how some of the top cryptocurrencies are looking like right now on their MVRV Z-Score. The “Market Value to Realized Value” (MVRV) refers to a popular on-chain indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the market cap and realized cap for any given asset. The realized cap here is a capitalization model that calculates the total valuation of the cryptocurrency by assuming that the ‘real’ value of any token in circulation is equal to the price at which said coin was last transacted on the blockchain. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Surges 18%, But Watch Out For Crowd FOMO As the previous transaction of any coin was the last time it changed hands, the price at its time would denote its cost basis. Thus, the realized cap is a sum of the cost basis of all tokens in the circulating supply. Put another way, this model measures the total capital the investors used to purchase the asset’s supply. The market cap, in contrast, keeps track of the value these investors hold. As such, the MVRV, which compares these two metrics, tells us about the profit/loss situation of the investors as a whole. In the context of the current topic, the actual metric of interest is the “MVRV Z-score.” This indicator takes the difference between the market cap and the realized cap and divides it by the standard deviation of the market cap over the asset’s entire history. Now, here is the chart shared by Santiment that shows the trend in this indicator for various coins in the sector: Based on the MVRV Z-Score, Santiment has defined three zones that relate to how far from its fair value the asset is. The chart shows that Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Uniswap (UNI) have had the indicator at -1.55 and -1.96 recently, putting these assets inside the ‘underbought’ territory. At these MVRV Z-Score values, the market cap is significantly lesser than the realized cap, meaning investors are widely lost. Generally, profit holders are a more likely source of selling pressure in the market, so when there are few of them left, price corrections can become less probable. Related Reading: Retail Losing Interest In Bitcoin? Volume Plunges 30% This is why assets are considered undervalued when the indicator drops below the -1 level for them. Due to a similar reasoning, values above 1 correlate to the coin being overvalued. Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Toncoin (TON) have recently been inside this latter territory, suggesting that their prices could be in danger of seeing bearish action. Shiba Inu and Uniswap, on the other hand, could be better set up for a price surge. SHIB Price At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading around $0.0000171, up 2% over the past week.

42417860,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTa52T,1719850282,DePIN: It's Time for Crypto to Get Real,"Few things get your average crypto enthusiast as excited as a brand-new cryptic abbreviation to rally around. This cycle, the DePIN banner is flying high, and compared to some of the past crazes, this one is actually pretty wholesome. Not just that — it’s exciting, it has a ton of potential, and it marries Web3 and the real world in a way that actually makes sense… All while being a beast the mainstream crypto space is unprepared for.  Why? Before we dive into that, let’s quickly put the spotlight on the “what.”  Demystifying DePIN  For now, quite a few people — even crypto-natives — arch their eyebrows at the mention of DePIN as the term is yet to fully settle in. So in the interest of clarity, DePIN stands for Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks, or in simple terms, real-world applications. DePINs leverage tokens to incentivize people to set up hardware for providing and rendering real-world services. Think car-sharing, peer-to-peer solar power trading, 5G or WiFi connectivity, street mapping, electric vehicle charging, environmental data collection through smartphones, and other exciting use cases.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's new ""DePIN Vertical"" devoted to exploring the future of decentralized infrastructure.  As an example, consider Silencio, which enables people to record noise pollution levels with their smartphones and earn token rewards for it. Another DePIN, Wingbits, uses tokens to incentivize people to set up private antennas tracking planes’ location data broadcasts. For history buffs among us, the fundamental model behind DePINs isn’t new; only the term, coined by Messari in late 2022, is actually relatively recent.  Early on, the name got its fair share of smirks — nothing wrong with that, memes are the way of Web3 — but its introduction set off a powerful movement imbued with a promise of change. And this change, interestingly enough, goes both ways, not only aiming at how we manage and earn from devices, but also making us, the Web3 natives, reconsider the way we think about Web3.  Bringing crypto into the real world is an exciting idea, if not a one-of-a-kind opportunity. It’s what the masses have been waiting for: real, tangible use-cases for blockchain that people actually need and use daily. The flipside is that this one-of-a-kind opportunity takes a bit more effort from launching another dog-themed memecoin, and has a lot of its own specifics too.  Why DePINs aren’t regular dApps  So what makes DePINs special? To answer this question, let’s imagine a hypothetical DePIN that enables you to earn tokens for measuring local temperature through a smart thermometer. That’s already where we bump right into one of the many, many elephants in the room: the hardware.  How do we go about the thermometers? Do we let users connect any third-party devices capable of recording and sending data? Sure, and let’s applaud our own open-source spirit while we’re at it. But let’s not forget to write the code that will support the widest variety of smart sensors and will feature a simple user interface that will make adding them a breeze. And that’s no easy task, mind you.  It’s what the “masses” have been waiting for: real, tangible use-cases for blockchain that people actually need and use daily  The alternative is to manufacture the hardware ourselves, which lands us in yet another animal reservation. Now, we’re no longer simply building a dApp, we’re also building a custom piece of hardware and taking on the joys of manufacturing, storage, and shipment. Of course, we can always buy a white-label solution, hire contractors, and do a ton of other reasonable things, which all lead us to our next trunked beast: the token economics.  You see, the price of all of that has to be accounted for in the token economics. Whether we expect the community to purchase a thermometer from us or not, we have to be mindful of this investment when we lay out the rewards and incentives. People will expect a return on their investment in hardware, after all, and quite reasonably. And with that, we are no longer writing token economics for people, as regular dApps do, we are writing them for people and value-generating machines — machines that are growing more intelligent by the day and turning from mere tools into economic agents.  See how significant this distinction is? And that’s only the supply side so far.  Being real ain’t easy  Now, let’s consider the other part of the equation. A crypto token can live off the hype, memes, and sheer unhinged speculation we know Web3 for. A DePIN can’t. In our case, it needs weather companies, researchers, and anyone else willing to buy the temperature data we collect. In other cases, it’s devices using its IoT connectivity network, or drivers looking for charging spots; the gist is, DePINs need real-world demand for their real-world service. They must push beyond the Web3 echochamber and, often enough, even compete with Web2 rivals.  The good news is, they are up to the challenge. When they’re armed with a solid idea and execution, DePINs have several unfair advantages over their Web2 incumbents. For example they can bootstrap their way to scale – fast – and they can undercut virtually any centralized competitor. You read that right; Uber, the undercutter of all undercutters, may have met its match. The bad news is, crypto isn’t as used to this business model as it thinks. Thus, solid enterprise ties are a must for any aspiring DePIN ecosystem, as they help with securing this demand, and with various other headaches, such as hardware manufacturing.  Let’s not forget about having to win the hearts and minds, too. DePINs have to approach entirely new audiences, people who are an afterthought for most crypto projects. Think IoT and tech geeks, but also anyone who could host and run hardware, from drivers (they really love their world-mapping DePINs) to small businesses. It’s no easy task, marketing-wise, and one that further distinguishes DePINs as a unique Web3 sector.  None of this is fatal, obviously, as the sector powers on, but all of this makes for a gauntlet that calls for a new mindset, architecture and language.  Mindset: more attentive of real-world challenges that DePINs can tackle and savvier in accounting for the hurdles in the path, including things like actual product marketing and user experience to compete with Web2 rivals.  Architecture: merging smart contracts with edge computing and peer-to-peer device interactions, mindful of the real-world challenges involved.  Language: more accessible to the non-Web3, those who didn’t spend their last few years chasing the crypto bags, language of business cases and efficient solutions.  The beauty of DePIN is that it gives us all a chance to judge crypto based on its real-world usefulness. By tapping into real demand and supply, DePINs give us all clearer metrics to go by.. How many devices are on a DePIN? How many people use the DePIN’s services? Is its pricing and services better than those of Web2 rivals? It’s not about speculation anymore, but about making a positive impact on the world. This is what truly singles DePINs out across the entire Web3 space as a unique and self-standing sector. Their supporting layer-1 backbones should be as wary of this as the wider Web3 community if we want this space to finally bring in real-world blockchain adoption — this time, for real.

While investors continue to ponder on Bitcoin’s price trajectory in July, on-chain data, price history, and strategic transactions point to a bullish July. Despite the short-term volatility, many investors remain bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. Notably, data shows an interesting $500 million increase in bids below the spot price and a rise in open interest, as pointed out by popular crypto analyst Daan Crypto Trades. Bitcoin Investors Place $500 Million Bids Below Price Bitcoin traded for the majority of the weekend just above $61,000 as the bulls fought to prevent another drop below $60,000. According to a BTCUSDT chart shared on social media over the weekend by Daan Crypto Trades, many strategic investors have positioned themselves below the price level to jump on Bitcoin in case of a break below $50,000. Related Reading: XRP Dominance: Pundit Says Missing This Altcoin Could Be A Big Mistake This exciting strategy amounted to over $500 million in buy prices over the weekend across price points stretching from above $60,500 to below $58,500. The bids create a solid foundation of buying pressure that prevents the price from falling much further. This creates intense support levels, making it extremely unlikely we’ll see a capitulation-style price collapse below $60,000 anytime soon. Furthermore, Daan Crypto Trades pointed out a corresponding increase in the Bitcoin open interest. The latest data from CoinGlass supports this claim, with a 3.11% increase in open interest across various crypto exchanges in the past 24 hours. This increase in open interest represents new money coming into the market, which suggests a bullish, optimistic sentiment among traders. #Bitcoin $500M+ in bids were placed below price (but mostly pulled) and open interest going up. Doubt we’ll get our usual weekend price action as mentioned. Quite a lot of action relatively speaking. End of the quarter usually causes some interesting moves. https://t.co/4rRSjZMGhz pic.twitter.com/7SJh6EYs7J — Daan Crypto Trades (@DaanCrypto) June 29, 2024 What To Expect In July Bitcoin’s price action in June definitely surprised many investors. Particularly, the digital asset declined by 9.85% in June to reverse an 11.07% increase in May. This shows the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies and reflects Bitcoin’s ups and downs over the years. Naturally, this has led to more cautious strategies by traders on how they approach their Bitcoin positions in the new month. Related Reading: XRP Price On The Verge Of Breaking Falling Wedge That Could Lead To 4% Increase At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $63,200 and is up by 3% in the past 24 hours. If history were to repeat itself, Bitcoin would likely see a rise in July. As noted by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, when Bitcoin has had a negative June, it tends to bounce back strongly in July. In fact, negative price actions in June have preceded an average return of 7.98% and a median return of 9.60% in July. A similar price action could see Bitcoin end the month between $68,000 and $69,500. Historically, when #Bitcoin has had a negative June, it tends to bounce back strongly in July.

42417855,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTa4yL,1719848918,U.S. Administrative Procedure Law Exists for a Reason. The SEC Must Follow It,"Since 1946, in the wake of the New Deal, federal government agencies have had to abide by the constitutional safeguards and processes set forth in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The APA is specifically designed to allow for public participation, transparency, and accountability in the agency rulemaking process, and provides the public with a right to challenge in court an agency action that fails to follow the APA’s requirements. Simply put, the APA ensures that federal agencies provide notice and meaningful opportunities for engagement so the American people have a say in the agency-made rules that impact and govern many aspects of our lives and our economy – from food safety labeling to rules controlling how we pay taxes.  For the past two years, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been working to finalize a rule that expands the definition of “dealer” under U.S. securities laws. Unfortunately, the agency finalized the rule while ignoring the APA, depriving the public of well-reasoned decision making and a clear explanation of how the rule applies to them. Unsurprisingly, two lawsuits have already been filed that challenge the rule’s finalization and ask a court to vacate the rule.  For nearly 100 years, market participants have benefited greatly from a firm understanding of whether they’re legally required to register as a dealer or not, hinging on the services provided by a dealer to their customer. However, the SEC’s newly expanded definition of “dealer” now includes any person whose trading activity regularly has the effect of providing liquidity, even if this person has no customers at all. Under this new definition, even with no intermediary and no customer relationship, people who trade digital assets on peer-to-peer trading platforms, and thus provide liquidity, and potentially the software developers of such platforms, would need to abide by SEC dealer registration requirements or could face severe SEC enforcement action.  The new standard is overly broad and ignores long-standing legal precedent focused on dealer service to customers, and undoubtedly will inject instability and risk into the market. The change also blatantly violates the APA on multiple fronts. Most egregiously, even as Commissioner Hester Peirce, the SEC commissioner known to be most favorable to digital assets, noted the SEC’s economic analysis on the rule’s impact on digital asset market participants found the consequences of the rule are too “difficult to predict,” despite receiving dozens of robust comments warning of what those consequences will be.  That’s why Blockchain Association joined the Crypto Freedom Alliance of Texas in filing one of the suits against the SEC. The APA has to mean something. Those who run the administrative agencies of our federal government, like the SEC, are appointed – not directly elected by the people. There ought to be ways to hold them accountable and ensure American voices are factored into agency decision making.  As we argue in our lawsuit, the SEC, in finalizing the Dealer Rule, violated the APA by changing the definition in a manner that extends beyond its Congressional authority – far exceeding how the term “dealer” has been interpreted for decades by policymakers and the courts. Federal agencies must legally explain their actions when they depart from a previously held position.  In expanding the scope of the Dealer Rule, the SEC asserts it didn’t change its position at all. But the SEC’s new interpretation of dealer, which looks at the after-the-fact effects of trading activity, is clearly a departure from its prior interpretation of dealer, which looked at whether a person was offering services to customers. This is what has guided market participants for the better part of the last century. To suggest otherwise is disingenuous and dishonest, at best.  The SEC also failed to respond to comments or engage in reasoned decision-making, as required by the APA. Between proposing this rule change more than two years ago and finalizing it just a few months ago, the SEC had plenty of opportunity to listen to and engage with the digital asset industry, which submitted to the agency dozens of robust and thoughtful comments that detailed the impact of the rule on the digital asset ecosystem. For instance, the rule will increase market instability, decrease access to the market, and will push entrepreneurs, businesses, and jobs overseas to less regulated – and less safe – jurisdictions.  Yet, the SEC barely acknowledged this feedback, as required by the APA, and instead, finalized the rule with no analysis as to the effect on digital asset markets, no clarity as to which digital asset market participants are implicated, and no explanation as to how participants can comply. Commissioner Peirce, , further highlighted the SEC’s refusal to address the Dealer Rule’s application to decentralized finance innovations, despite commenters’ repeated concerns and questions about new qualitative tests for determining who would be considered a dealer under the new rule.  Ultimately, the SEC’s refusal to even simply respond to comments about the reach and implications of the new Dealer Rule has left the digital asset industry in the dark and concerned for its future.  No business or industry should be forced to operate in constant fear of post hoc second-guessing and “gotcha” enforcement tactics, especially for potential violations of new rules developed outside the bounds of the law. For decades, our country has been the global leader in innovation, but the new Dealer Rule undermines our competitive edge and standing in the global marketplace by forcing developers and entrepreneurs off-shore. What could be more un-American than knowingly stifling our own spirit of innovation?  Late last week, in overturning the Chevron doctrine, we saw the Supreme Court take a major step toward reigning in unfettered regulatory interpretations that hurt American businesses and consumers alike. We’re hopeful the courts don’t stop there and will continue to strike down government overreach. Given the grave ramifications of keeping the Dealer Rule in place when the APA was so clearly violated, the courts must intervene to overturn this harmful rule and ensure it does not go into effect.

42417852,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTa4uD,1719846000,Circle Snags First Stablecoin License Under EU's New MiCA Crypto Rules,"Circle is claiming bragging rights as the first global stablecoin issuer to comply with MiCA.  Before the rules took effect on June 30, some exchanges delisted euro-denominated stablecoins, such as Tether’s EURT.  Circle became the first global stablecoin issuer to secure an Electronic Money Institution (EMI) license, a prerequisite to offering dollar- and euro-pegged crypto tokens in the European Union (EU) under the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework.  The license gives the company, whose USDC trails behind rival Tether's market-leading USDT, pole position in grabbing market share among the 27-nation trading bloc's 450 million people.  Stablecoins are a key piece of infrastructure in the digital asset market, facilitating trading on exchanges and, increasingly, used for transactions and remittances. Circle's $32 billion USDC is the second-largest stablecoin and the gap to market leader Tether's $110 billion USDT has been widening.  Armed with a license from the French banking regulatory authority, Circle Mint France will “onshore” the issuance of its euro-denominated EURC stablecoin to the EU and issue USDC from the same entity, the company said. Before MiCA's stablecoin rules took effect on June 30, some crypto exchanges delisted euro-denominated stablecoins, such as Tether’s EURT.  MiCA’s comprehensive stance on stablecoins was catalyzed by the specter of big tech, like Meta's Diem (formerly Libra) initiative, entering financial markets. That prompted five years of concerted policy development in Europe, said Circle’s head of policy, Dante Disparte, who was involved in the Libra project.  “Personally, I feel a little bit of a semi-parental relationship with MiCA because in some ways it was accelerated by my prior life and my prior project, Libra Diem,” Disparate said in an interview. “MiCA is both vindicating of the industry and its permanence, but it's also clear that there is no more shortcuts, at least not in the third-largest economy in the world. Gone are the days where you could operate in a regulatory haven or in the shadows and then expect to have liberal and free access to consumers and market participants.”  Read more: EU's Restrictive Stablecoin Rules Take Effect Soon and Issuers Are Running Out of Time  UPDATE (July 1, 15:15 UTC): Adds stablecoin utility, relative market caps of USDC, USDT in third paragraph.",POSITIVE,USDT | USDC,MARKET | TRADING | USDT | USDC,"Ian Allison, Krisztian Sandor",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/07/01/stablecoin-issuer-circle-snags-mica-compliant-emi-license-for-europe,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9fbb1ca6422b4ad63958c43d6e47caa453346e04-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

30237585,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=627180,1719844225,"Dogecoin Could Eclipse $1 Mark This Bull Run, Predicts Analyst","In a technical analysis, noted crypto analyst Big Mike (@Michael_EWpro), has revealed a bullish forecast for Dogecoin (DOGE) that suggests the meme coin could surpass the $1 threshold in this bull cycle. The Dogecoin price prediction is rooted in the Elliott Wave theory, and is further reinforced by a robust set of technical indicators that underscore the coin’s strong upward potential. Dogecoin Could Peak Above $1 In 2025 The weekly chart (DOGE/USDT) highlights Dogecoin’s previous market performance, where it completed a 5-wave Elliott Wave pattern during the last significant bull run. This pattern saw the price of Dogecoin escalate to just above $0.70. Following this surge, the market entered a corrective phase characterized by a WXY pattern—a complex Elliott Wave correction structure that typically consists of three distinct price movements. This corrective phase marked a period of consolidation and retraction in Dogecoin’s price trajectory following its peak. Related Reading: Dogecoin To The Moon? Crypto Analyst Predicts 440% Price Increase Since late 2023, according to Big Mike’s analysis, Dogecoin has embarked on a new 5-wave pattern. This nascent formation is anticipated to drive the Dogecoin price significantly higher than its previous highs. The first wave propelled the DOGE price to a peak just shy of $0.23. Following this, the second wave commenced, resulting in a retracement that pulled the price down to as low as $0.1140. The analysis indicates that Dogecoin is currently in the initial stages of the third wave of this Elliott Wave pattern. Traditionally, the third wave is the most dynamic and typically extends the furthest, especially within a strong bullish context. Notably, Big Mike highlights the existence of an ascending channel starting from the onset of wave 1 further corroborates the bullish sentiment maintained in this analysis. This channel maps out the potential pathway that Dogecoin might follow as it aims for new highs. The wave 3 could peak at the upper trendline of the channel, at around $0.60. Related Reading: Dogecoin Profitability Rises To 75% As Shiba Inu Plunges To 52% Wave 4 could potentially pull the Dogecoin price back to the lower boundary of the ascending channel, approximately around $0.25. This retracement would set the stage for Wave 5, the climactic phase of the Dogecoin bull run, which is projected to propel DOGE above the $1 mark, coinciding with the upper resistance line of the channel. The chart carefully marks critical Fibonacci extension levels which are drawn from the beginning to the peak of the last bull run. that are expected to play pivotal roles in determining future price points during this bull run. The first notable Fibonacci extension at 2.618 is positioned at approximately $0.14591, serving as an intermediate station within the bull cycle. The 3.618 extension at $0.68835 serves as an intermediary target for the final fifth wave. The Volume Profile Visible Range (VPVR) on the chart reveals that the current price zone has a high concentration of traded volume, suggesting it acts as a robust foundation for the current price level. The absence of significant volume above this area hints at minimal resistance, which could allow for an accelerated price climb once Dogecoin breaks above existing resistance levels. Technical indicators such as the weekly Stochastic RSI and the weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) support an imminent bullish phase. The Stochastic RSI is in the oversold region, indicating potential for a price recovery. Meanwhile, the RSI’s upward trend with higher lows suggests growing bullish momentum. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.1247.

42417870,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTa5Cn,1719843097,UPDATE: Polymarket Logs First $100M Month as Election Drama Heats Up,"This week in prediction markets:  Polymarket topped $100 million in volume in June, a record month in the middle of a breakout year for the crypto-based prediction market platform.  Biden: Will he stay or will he go?  Short term stability for BTC prices, but a dip below $50K is in the cards before a rally to over $75K.  ""Stranded"" astronauts unlikely to depart International Space Station via Boeing ship in late July.  Polymarket's volume soared well past $100 million in June, a record month during a breakout year for the crypto-based prediction market platform.  A total of $111 million in bets were placed on Polymarket last month, according to Dune Analytics data. It was by far the best month ever for the company, which celebrated its four-year anniversary last month and is riding high on enthusiasm for the November U.S. election.  The most recent catalyst is President Joe Biden's performance at last week's presidential debate, an unmitigated disaster.  The New York Times' editorial board, usually a source of stalwart support for a Democratic White House, is calling on him to step down. A CBS/YouGov poll says 72% of voters believe Biden does not have the cognitive health to serve as President.  Biden's odds of becoming President dropped from 33.5% pre-debate to 18% as of Monday morning U.S. time, with Trump solidifying his lead at 63%.  Another contract, this one about the possibility of Biden dropping out of the race entirely, also rocketed off in trading volume post-debate, with ""yes"" shares hitting 44 cents in the hours after, up from 19 cents prior.  Each share pays out $1 (in the USDC stablecoin) if the prediction comes true and zero if not, so the 44 cent price indicated a 44% probability Biden would bow out.  A story from NBC that Biden was to spend the weekend with his family at the Mount David Presidential retreat to discuss the future of his campaign pushed the odds up to 50%.  Those odds leveled out to just over 40% as of Monday morning U.S. time as over the weekend the White House pushed back on reports, saying the trip was pre-planned.  For his part, President Biden is adamant that he will remain in the race.  “I understand the concern after the debate. I get it,” NPR quoted the President as saying to a room full of donors. “I didn’t have a great night. But I’m going to be fighting harder and going to need you with me to get it done.”  The contract has attracted serious political bettors, with the largest holders on both sides of the digital aisle largely betting on politics-themed markets.  ""Therealbatman,"" the largest No holder, holds $2.9 million in different political contracts, consistently betting that Biden and Trump will win their respective nominations, that Biden will win the popular vote, and that Trump won't win the U.S. Presidential Election.  The only exception to Therealbatman's largely political portfolio involves a $50,000 bet that the Eigen token, the native token for the Eigenlayer protocol, won't be transferable before former Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, gets out of prison.  On the other side of the aisle, the largest holder of the ""yes"" side of the Biden drop-out contract, an anonymous user only known by his or her Ethereum wallet address, holds a $184,000 position on Biden's fate, as well as a $6,200 stake that Michelle Obama will with the Democratic nomination.  This user also has a $9,700 bet that longshot independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will win the presidential election, which is currently trading at 2 cents.  Bitcoin price predictions  Traders on prediction markets have mixed opinions on where the price of bitcoin is going.  In the short term: stability.  A Polymarket contract gives bitcoin a 78% chance of being above $61,000 by July 5.  For reference, CoinDesk Indices data had bitcoin trading above $63,300 for most of the Monday business day in Asia, a marked recovery from its tests below $60,000 as last week began.  CoinDesk Indices' Bitcoin Trend Indicator notes that the world's largest digital asset is in a period of ""significant downtrend.""  Here's where things start to get complicated. The markets ""tea leaves"" that bettors are trying to read put us in for a correction before a rally that might test BTC's all-time high.  First, one contract on the U.S.-regulated Kalshi platform projects a 65% chance of bitcoin dipping below $50,000 by the end of 2024 and a 22% chance of it reaching below $40,000. At the same time, another contract projects a 70% chance of BTC hitting $75,000 or above by the end of the year.  Unlike Polymarket, which does business almost everywhere except the U.S., Kalshi is U.S.-only, and its bets are settled in dollars.  There are a couple of indicators that the market expects bitcoin's price to be challenged by continued dollar strength. This will certainly subside once the Federal Reserve begins to cut rates, which bettors are almost certain will happen by the last quarter.  Stranded in space  Boeing has had a tough time on Earth and its troubles seem to have extended past the confines of the planet.  The troubled aerospace giant's first space capsule is stuck at the International Space Station (ISS) after helium leaks and thruster issues have kept it docked without a definite return date. Starliner's trip was supposed to conclude on June 13.  Bettors think that the astronauts will be on the ISS for some time longer, with a Polymarket contract giving only an 11% chance of the astronauts departing on the Starliner by July 21.  The market's fine print says that the astronauts must depart on Boeing's Starliner. A rescue vessel from SpaceX or Russia won't count. Nor does it specify that the astronauts would have to safely return to Earth.

30234583,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=627181,1719838839,Ethereum Goes Budget-Friendly: Transaction Fees Drop To Lowest Since 2016,"Ethereum, the world’s second-largest blockchain platform, has entered a new era marked by record-low transaction fees. This dramatic shift, the most significant since 2016, has sent ripples of excitement through the cryptocurrency community, raising hopes for increased adoption and a more accessible DeFi (Decentralized Finance) landscape. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekend Trading Takes A Siesta: Volumes Plunge To Record Lows From Pricey To Penny-Pinching Previously, Ethereum’s notorious gas fees, the cost of processing transactions on the network, had become a major barrier to entry. During peak periods in 2021, fees skyrocketed to a staggering 100 gwei, effectively pricing out many users and hindering the network’s growth. This recent fee freefall, however, paints a drastically different picture. With average fees hovering around 3 gwei (equivalent to a fraction of a US cent), interacting with the Ethereum network has become significantly more affordable. News of the record-low gas fees first surfaced via Wu Blockchain, a respected online source for cryptocurrency news. The information was then corroborated by Coinbase Director Conor, lending further weight to the reports. According to data shared by Coinbase Director Conor, Ethereum is experiencing the lowest average network fee since 2016. Among the 10 periods with the lowest average fee per hour on the Ethereum network, 9 were recorded this week, all below 3.3 gwei. At 4:00 UTC on June 30, the… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) June 30, 2024 Analysts attribute this dramatic decline to a confluence of factors. Recent network upgrades, specifically those focused on improving efficiency, have played a crucial role in streamlining transaction processing. Additionally, the overall decrease in network activity, potentially due to a broader crypto market slump, has also contributed to the lower fees. A Boon For Builders And Blockchain Beginners? The implications of these low fees are far-reaching. For developers, the Ethereum network has become a more attractive platform for deploying decentralized applications (dApps). Lower transaction costs make it easier to experiment and iterate on new projects, potentially leading to a surge in innovative dApp development. YCharts offers a visualization tool for tracking the Ethereum Average Transaction Fee. This chart (above) allows users to monitor fee trends over time, providing valuable insights into network activity and user behavior. Related Reading: Bullish Signs For Polkadot (DOT): Analyst Eyes $12 On The Horizon For users, particularly those new to the crypto space, the reduced fees significantly lower the barrier to entry. This opens the door for a wider range of individuals to participate in DeFi activities, such as lending, borrowing, and trading digital assets. A more accessible Ethereum could lead to a broader user base and a more robust DeFi ecosystem. However, some experts caution that the long-term implications of these low fees remain to be seen. The Ethereum network relies on transaction fees to incentivize miners who validate transactions and secure the network. A sustained period of extremely low fees could potentially impact network security, raising concerns about the long-term health of the ecosystem.

Participants can also request customized structures to target specific yields or create bespoke hedges for their assets.  U.S.-regulated cryptocurrency custody firm Anchorage Digital is offering clients yields of up to 40% in partnership with Hashnote, a digital asset manager built with the support of trading giants Cumberland and DRW.  Hashnote Harbor, announced on Monday by the companies, delivers those returns through a suite of derivatives strategies without the underlying assets ever leaving the custody of Anchorage Digital, according to a press release. Participants can request customized structures to target specific yields or create bespoke hedges for their assets, it said.  The tie-up should appeal to institutional investors looking for a range of digital asset yield-generating options without so much in the way of credit, custodial, or protocol risk.  “Getting some of the benefits of traditional finance into the crypto ecosystem means the best of both worlds: the decentralization ethos and the broad adoption of the assets,” Anchorage co-founder Nathan McCauley said in an interview. “There are hard-won and wise ways to set things up that traditional capital markets have been figuring out for the last seven or eight decades.”  Both firms have well-established U.S. regulatory profiles: Anchorage qualifies as a crypto bank with a federal bank charter from the Office of Comptroller of the Currency (OCC); Hashnote is registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as a Commodity Pool Operator (CPO).  McCauley takes a philosophical view of the dichotomy between state-regulated crypto custodians and those supervised at the federal level.  “It's almost an American tradition at this point to say that there's more than one way to do it,” he said. “You see this in a variety of angles, whether it's policing, elections, banking, all of these are kind of intertwined where you're under a dual sovereign situation, and in many ways it’s like an instantiation of the crypto ethos of decentralization. And I actually think it's quite beautiful that there's not just one way that you can answer a particular question.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | COMMODITY | FIAT | SPONSORED | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/07/01/crypto-custody-firm-anchorage-offers-investment-returns-through-deal-with-cumberland-backed-hashnote,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/59f8760b474b4b8b247ca669b77d42a12d75072c-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Canaccord noted that institutional adoption of crypto is still growing with more than half of the world’s largest hedge funds now trading or holding spot bitcoin ETFs.  Ether spot ETFs should help broaden institutional appetite for other digital assets, the broker said.  The approval of bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}} spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is encouraging and while digital assets underperformed traditional assets in the second quarter, potential ETF inflows could reverse the recent trend, broker Canaccord Genuity said in a quarterly report on Sunday.  Spot ETFs are expected to become a more meaningful part of crypto’s price action, analysts led by Michael Graham wrote.  Canaccord notes that while bitcoin ETF inflows slowed from the February highs, institutional adoption is still growing,and “more than 50% of the world’s largest hedge funds are now trading/holding spot BTC ETFs, major institutions have only just started to disclose holdings and the SEC may soon approve BTC ETF options.”  Retail investors may also look to buy ETFs to gain crypto exposure via individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and other tax-advantaged accounts, the report said. Bitcoin spot ETFs were first approved for trading in the U.S. in January of this year.  The launch of ether spot ETFs is expected later this summer after the SEC approved initial filings from issuers last month. The regulator needs to endorse S-1 filings before the new products can start trading. Despite macro uncertainty and the timing of any future interest rate cuts, “favorable supply-demand dynamics post-halving could add to the ETF tailwinds for bitcoin,” Canaccord said.  Spot ether ETFs, once they start trading, could also have a positive impact, and “should help broaden institutional appetite for other assets,” benefiting the wider crypto ecosystem, the report added.

42417869,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTa5Bl,1719837374,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Relief Rally Stalls at $63K as Crypto Rebound Faces Hurdles,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Digital asset markets rebounded over the weekend, with the broad market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) climbing more than 4% since Friday midnight UTC. Bitcoin bounced to $63,500 from its Friday dip below $60,000 before faltering and slipping below $63,000 toward the start of the U.S. trading session. July tends to be a positive month for BTC, 10x Research wrote in a Monday update, but any lull over coming months will probably continue as the third quarter is usually the weakest for digital assets.  Metaplanet bought another $1.2 million in BTC as its investment strategy progressed. The Japanese investment adviser boosted its bitcoin treasury holdings to 161 BTC worth more than $10 million at current prices. The purchase was part of the company's bitcoin accumulation plan following last week's announcement it planned to acquire $6 million of the largest crypto asset, mirroring the U.S.-listed MicroStrategy's footsteps as a public company issuing bonds to raise funds and acquire bitcoin. The growing popularity of this strategy prompted digital asset prime services provider Abra to introduce a treasury service for corporates that want to hold crypto on their balance sheets as a reserve asset.  Sony plans to restart Japanese crypto exchange Whalefin. According to a PR Times report, Sony will revive the exchange ""soon,"" releasing a new app. The tech giant acquired Whalefin last year from embattled crypto lender and asset manager Amber Group. Previously, Sony dabbled in Web3 through investments and partnerships, and the launch will mark the PlayStation maker's proper foray into crypto.  Chart of the Day  The table shows bitcoin's monthly price performance since 2013.  July has generally been a positive month for bitcoin, with prices gaining eight times out of 12 and declining four times.

The umbrella body for central banks cautioned against premature easing of monetary policy.  The Bank of International Settlements (BIS) warned heavily indebted nations on Sunday of a sudden loss of market confidence, validating the long-standing concern in the crypto market.  ""Though financial market pricing points to only a small likelihood of public finance stress at present, confidence could quickly crumble if economic momentum weakens and an urgent need for public spending arises on both structural and cyclical fronts,"" the BIS said in an annual report published Sunday. ""Government bond markets would be hit first, but the strains could spread more broadly, as they have in the past.""  The BIS did not single out any nation in particular but cautioned advanced economies from running fiscal deficits larger than 1% of the gross domestic product (GDP) this year, down from 1.6% in 2023. The warning could not have been more timely as several nations, including the U.S., go to polls this year, where by governments typically boost spending to garner voter support.  Per some crypto pundits, both bitcoin and gold have been pricing a fiscal crisis in the U.S. and other advanced nations. This year, the so-called zero-yield assets have rallied 48% and 13%, respectively, supposedly on haven demand. While crypto propounders consider BTC an anti-thesis to fiat malaise, the cryptocurrency has tended to drop in line with other risk assets during times of stress.  Public debt as a ratio to GDP has soared worldwide since 2020, a direct result of the coronavirus pandemic that compelled governments to increase spending significantly while facing dwindling revenues. Concurrent rapid rate hikes by central banks added to the fiscal burden. At the end of 2023, the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio was 123%, indicating a larger total debt than the country's economic output.  The consensus in the crypto market is that mounting debt concerns will force the Fed and other central banks to cut rates, spurring more investor inflows into alternative assets like bitcoin. The CME's FedWatch tool shows traders expect the Fed to cut rates twice this year, by 25 basis points each time.  The BIS, however, has urged central banks to set a ""high bar for policy easing.""  ""A premature easing could reignite inflationary pressures and force a costly policy reversal – all the costlier because credibility would be undermined. Indeed, risks of de-anchored inflation expectations have not gone away, as pressure points remain,"" the BIS said.  The BIS added that fiscal consolidation will ultimately lessen the need to keep interest rates elevated.  ""For fiscal policy, consolidation is an absolute priority. In the near term, this would help relieve pressure on inflation and lessen the need to keep interest rates high, in turn helping to preserve financial stability,"" the BIS noted.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/01/market-confidence-could-quickly-crumble-bis-warns-indebted-nations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2c44cc3d31cc4bf73f9760c3c42368a9843e2767-1104x621.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

30231696,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=627173,1719833432,"Bitcoin Nears $64,515 Resistance: Will A Breakthrough Ignite A Bullish Run?","Bitcoin (BTC) is on the brink of a significant price movement as it approaches the crucial resistance level of $64,515. The cryptocurrency asset has been experiencing an upward trend, gaining momentum and investor confidence. Breaking through this key resistance could act as a catalyst for a major rally, potentially pushing BTC to new heights. Traders and market analysts are closely monitoring this level, as a successful breach could signal a strong bullish phase and attract increased trading activity, further driving up the price. This article aims to provide an in-depth analysis of Bitcoin’s current price movement as it nears the significant resistance level of $64,515. It seeks to explore the potential market implications of breaking through this key threshold, including the likelihood of igniting a substantial rally. Furthermore, it examines technical indicators, market sentiment, and historical data to offer readers a comprehensive understanding of what this resistance level means for Bitcoin’s long and short-term price trajectory. With a market capitalization of more than $1.2 trillion and a trading volume of more than $21 billion as of the time of writing, the price of Bitcoin is currently down by 3.26%, trading at around $63,300 in the last 24 hours. BTC market cap and trading volume are currently up by 3.03% and 77.17% respectively. Current Market Overview Of Bitcoin Upward Trend Currently, on the 4-hour chart, the price of BTC is on a bullish rise and attempting a cross above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) with strong bullish momentum. Also, it can be noticed that the crypto asset has broken above the 4-hour bearish trend line. The formation of the 4-hour Composite Trend Oscillator also signals bullishness for Bitcoin as both the signal line and the SMA of the indicator are attempting to cross above the zero line. On the 1-day chart, the price of Bitcoin is experiencing a strong momentum rise toward the $64,515 resistance and the 1-day SMA. Specifically, this price increase started two days ago after a rejection at the $60,152 support level. Finally, it can observed that the signal line of the 1-day Composite Trend Oscillator is attempting to cross above the SMA. This formation thereby indicates more bullishness for Bitcoin’s price. Breaking Through Or Facing Rejection Exploring possible market scenarios if Bitcoin breaks through or is rejected at $64,515 reveals that if the price of Bitcoin breaks above the $64,515 resistance level, it may continue to move upward toward the $66,736 resistance level. Should this level be breached, the crypto asset may experience more price growth toward the $71,909 resistance level and possibly other levels above. Conversely, should Bitcoin’s price undergo a rejection at the $64,515 level and begin to drop again, it will continue its downward movement toward the $60,152 support level. Following a break below this level, BTC may experience a further price drop to test the $56,523 support level and probably other levels below.

CleanSpark is utilizing their balance sheet to acquire additional data centers and engage in M&A for inorganic growth. CleanSpark's shares trade directionally with BTC and may realize strength as BTC is more widely held by retail investors. CleanSpark ( CLSK ) has found itself in a unique position when compared to other BTC mining operators as the firm remains flush with cash, bitcoin holdings, and a growing operation with the goal of reaching 50exahash/second in eFY25. As the firm operates in a more challenging BTC mining environment post-BTC halving, management has been opportunistic in acquiring competing mining operations to expand and benefit from the challenging environment. In addition to this, CleanSpark is in the process of building out an additional 75MW of capacity in Wyoming for an additional 4.2exahash/second to be added to the fleet for a total of 20.9exahash/second. Inclusive of their 5 new facilities in Georgia, the firm will have a total of 31.6exahash/second. Given CleanSpark’s expanding holdings of BTC and new operating facilities, I reiterate my BUY rating for CLSK shares with a price target of $28.67/share at 18x price/BV of BTC holdings. Be sure to review my initial coverage of CleanSpark here: CleanSpark May Benefit From The Bitcoin Halving Event CleanSpark Operations CleanSpark is entering the next stage in company development as the firm breaks ground at their newly announced 75MW mining facilities located in Wyoming. Management anticipates the 45MW mining operation to begin mining as soon as 120 days as of q2’24 . This site is an existing site that will require CleanSpark to bring in their equipment as the previous tenant exits the space. The 30MW site is a greenfield project that will require more construction; however, management anticipates having both sites operational before winter begins in Wyoming. Management mentioned on the q2’24 earnings call that the firm has secured 50MW of transformers and switching gear in anticipation of the build-out as well as execution of their option to acquire 100,000 S21 Pro miners. These two facilities are expected to add an additional 4.2 exahash/second to the firm’s existing 16.7exahash/second. CleanSpark will also have the flexibility to add additional capacity to these two sites for a total of 130MW for a total hash rate of 7.4exahash/second, leading to the firm having a total of 24.1exahash/second, a 44% increase to their existing hashrate. These facilities will likely bring CleanSpark economies of scale as the new S21 Pro equipment is expected to lower the firm’s average hash cost from $32 down to $28. This compares to their expected hash price of $50, resulting in the potential for wider operating margins in the coming year despite the BTC halving event. Overall operating capacity increased by 63%, leading to significantly stronger operations YTD. Corporate Reports Looking at CleanSpark’s mining rate per exahash, it is clear that the halving event has affected operations as the BTC yield has significantly declined. Though I believe that this will impact the firm’s operations and margins in the coming quarters, CleanSpark’s operational efficiencies that have resulted from higher compute power and energy efficiency may help soften the blow to the bottom line. CleanSpark’s average revenue per BTC mined significantly improved sequentially from $36.5k to $55k, adding significant cushion to their bottom line. As of the firm’s May 2024 BTC mining update that was released on June 4, 2024, CleanSpark now holds 6,154BTC on its books. CleanSpark announced the acquisition of 5 new BTC mining facilities in Georgia for $25.8mm in cash on June 18, 2024. These facilities will add 60MW of infrastructure and is expected to increase the firm’s hashrate by 3.7exahash/second to over 20exahash/second in total by the end of the month. Management noted that the data centers already have existing equipment on site and that the mining hardware has already been purchased. On June 27, 2024, CleanSpark announced their intent to acquire GRIID Infrastructure based on an enterprise value of $155mm in an all-stock deal. CleanSpark’s management announced that GRIID’s Tennessee assets will adopt CleanSpark’s mining operational efficiencies and will allow for the firm to expand their operations to 100MW in Tennessee by the end of CY24. Management also anticipates to reach 400MW by 2026. Management made some very strong comments during the q2’24 earnings call about the state of the market for BTC miners. Zachary Bradford, CEO of CleanSpark, discussed the imminent consolidation of the BTC mining industry as firms that operate at lower efficiency will likely be acquired or collapse as a result of the BTC halving event. Given the firm’s recently announced acquisitions post-q2’24 earnings, it is clear that this process has begun and will likely continue throughout the duration of the year. Given CleanSpark’s $681mm of liquidity as of q2’24, I believe the firm is in a prime position to continue outpacing less efficient mining operations and is well-position to acquire the laggards. Management also provided an update on their Sandersville location. As of q2’24, CleanSpark was operating at 180MW of the expected 230MW capacity. As of the earnings call, the firm is constrained by the utility in testing their 50MW transformers in order to build out the new substation. Though this will somewhat hinder mining operations, I do not anticipate this to significantly impact the firm long-term as they near their goal of 50exahash/second. CleanSpark Financials Corporate Reports CleanSpark experienced a $119mm gain on the fair value of BTC as per the remeasurement rule, leading to an adjustment to the firm’s reported total costs & expenses. Net of this adjustment, CleanSpark would have reported operating income of $17mm and net earnings of $7mm as opposed to the reported $137mm and $126mm, respectively. Corporate Reports This reporting rule change can work to benefit CleanSpark as the firm has added significant amounts of BTC to the books since reporting q2’24 earnings results, assuming the price of BTC improves into the next reportable quarter. The downside risk is that the price of BTC may work against CleanSpark as the price/coin remains in a volatile state. TradingView Valuation & Shareholder Value Corporate Reports Comparing the price performance of BTC to CLSK, it is apparent that CLSK shares move in tandem with the direction of BTC given this accounting phenomenon. TradingView If BTC were to continue its decline into the end of the reportable quarter for CleanSpark, the firm may report an impairment on their financials as a result of the price decline. Given this correlation, CLSK shares will likely be valued to the price of BTC as opposed to revenue or aEBITDA as it relates to the firm’s sales of BTC. Given CleanSpark’s multi-pronged valuation streams, I will value the firm based on aEBITDA generation paired with the value of BTC, as denoted by the two tables below. Corporate Reports Corporate Reports With my expected aEBITDA generation, I believe CLSK shares should be priced at $28.67/share at 18x price/BV of BTC, providing the firm significant upside potential as the firm generates cash through the sale of BTC as well as manages their holdings of the token. I recommend CLSK with a BUY rating. As denoted above, this buy rating comes with significant risks as CLSK shares are directionally motivated by the price of BTC. As denoted in the chart above, BTC appears to be rolling over and may continue this decline. One risk denoted in my recent report covering the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) is that as more institutional investors migrate a portion of their holdings to BTC, additional inherent risks will be involved with the pricing dynamics, which include rebalances, cash raises, and potential correlation with the broader indices in the instance of a market selloff. Given that I am not a BTC trader, I cannot recommend CLSK beyond their operational risk as it pertains to BTC directional risk.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4701815-cleanspark-financials-defy-btc-gravity?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/30231068.jpeg

The second, and final, round of votes will be held on July 7.  Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally (RN) party led voting after the first round of France's surprise general election on Sunday, Ministry of Interior data showed.  The party, founded by Le Pen's father Jean-Marie Le Pen, secured about 19% of the registered vote according to the provisional data. The opposition Union of the Left came second with 18.19% and Ensemble, which includes President Emmanuel Macron's Renaissance party, followed with 13.02%.  The results echo RN's victory in the European Parliament elections, which prompted Macron to call the election at short notice. Regardless of who wins, Macron has said he does not plan to resign. However, if his party fails to secure the 289-seat majority, this could make passing legislation harder.  ""It's difficult to say what will happen next week, but what’s clear is that Macron’s gamble seems at this stage to have backfired,"" Mark Foster, the EU policy lead at the Crypto Council for Innovation, told CoinDesk in a statement.  ""He had hoped that RN would not do as well in legislative elections as in the European ones, but they actually got a higher score. It looks like the new parliament will have much larger far left and far right contingents, making domestic policy development (including on crypto/digital assets) uncertain and difficult whilst limiting the president’s authority on international and European stages.""  National Rally, now led by Jordan Bardella while former leader Marine Le Pen heads the parliamentary party, wants to cut funding to the European Union, reduce immigration, remove the right to citizenship by birth and expel foreign offenders. According to Brittanica.com, it has been accused of fostering xenophobia and anti-Semitism.  The first round of the election eliminates anyone that does not score 12.5% of the locally registered vote. The second round, which will be held on July 7, is a choice among whoever remains in each constituency.  The nation has already made significant progress with crypto. Last year, France registered 74 crypto companies, a number that was expected to jump to 100, and regulators have been trying to attract more.  The Markets in Crypto Asset legislation, the European Union's wide-ranging crypto package, which includes measures for stablecoins, passed last year. The stablecoin rules have already come into effect while the rest of the legislation is expected to come into force by the end of the year. France has already enforced its own rules for the sector, something that is expected to give it a head start when it comes to implementing MiCA.

This suggests institutions are shaping new trading patterns, prioritizing weekdays over the once-active weekends. Beyond Weekends: A Multifaceted Market Transformation The decline in weekend activity isn’t solely attributable to ETFs. The closure of crypto-friendly banks like Signature and Silicon Valley Bank in March 2023 is another contributing factor. These institutions provided 24/7 infrastructure that enabled market makers to constantly place buy and sell orders. Their absence has created a void in weekend liquidity, further dampening trading activity. However, the changing landscape isn’t all doom and gloom. The report offers a glimmer of hope for investors seeking stability. The reduced weekend volatility could make Bitcoin a more predictable asset, potentially attracting a new wave of institutional interest. Additionally, the historical trend suggests July could be a positive month for Bitcoin, with price increases observed in seven out of the past 11 Julys. Jitters On The Horizon? While the weekend trading scene may be quieting down, the coming weeks look to be somewhat turbulent for the crypto market. The potential approval of Ethereum ETFs could further fuel institutional involvement and potentially impact Bitcoin’s dominance. Related Reading: Solana Poised For Epic Reversal? Analyst Spots Bullish Pattern Echoing 2022 Breakout The Road Ahead The dwindling weekend trading activity signifies a potential paradigm shift in the Bitcoin market. While the once-volatile weekends may become a relic of the past, the coming months promise to be eventful. Institutional investors are now in the spotlight, shaping new trading patterns and potentially ushering in an era of greater stability. However, this month could still introduce significant volatility, keeping investors on the edge of their seats. Featured image from Inc.

30226220,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=627151,1719821403,"Bitcoin Price Blasts Past $63,000: Top 3 Reasons","Over this past weekend, Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a significant rally, pushing its price above $63,000—an increase of 5.6% since hitting a low below $60,000 on Friday. This unexpected surge occurred despite a lack of major news triggers, leading to speculations and analyses concerning the underlying causes. Here’s a deep dive into three key factors that might explain this weekend’s price action. #1 Mysterious Bitcoin Whale Activity According to DeFi^2 (@DefiSquared), the number one ranked trader on Bybit and a leading wallet on DeBank, a mysterious “whale” has been active in the Binance perpetual futures market. DeFi^2 noted significant buying activity from this entity, stating, “Since the local BTC lows on Friday, almost the entire bounce this weekend is from a single entity on Binance Perps that has hammered over $450 million in buys in 500 BTC blocks at a time during the lowest liquidity hours of the market.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Records Surge In Retail Investors – Is A Price Rebound On? DeFi^2’s analysis sparked speculations about the whale’s potential strategies, especially considering the impending Mt. Gox distribution, which could further influence Bitcoin’s liquidity and price stability. He elaborated, “Curious what the endgame is right before the start of Mt Gox distribution. With a position of this size, in order to exit they’ll either need to run the market high enough to cause a short squeeze, or end up becoming a massive cascade risk if the market goes against them.” #2 Open Interest Build Up Crypto trader Daan Crypto Trades (@DaanCrypto) provided insights into how the futures market contributed to Bitcoin’s price movements. His focus was on the relationship between open interest and market price, a critical indicator of market sentiment and potential future volatility. “During this run up, we’ve mostly seen Open Interest rise with a few relatively small short squeezes and some long profit taking in between. I think there’s a lot of underwater shorts from the ~$60K region that should get squeezed out if price were to keep grinding higher. That $65K region is still a big area to watch out for,” Daan wrote. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miner Selling Cools Off – Is This The Breakout Moment? Interestingly, open interest on Bitcoin increased from $30.97 billion on Saturday to $32.21 billion by Monday, based on data from Coinglass. Despite this rise in open interest, the weekend did not see substantial short squeezes. The liquidation of only $35 million in BTC shorts during this period was relatively modest compared to past events, such as on May 20 when the price surge from $66,000 to $71,500 resulted in $84.2 million in short liquidations. #3 Technical Breakout Another contributing factor was likely a technical breakout for Bitcoin, which shifted the market momentum. Popular crypto analyst CRG (@MacroCRG) described the weekend’s price movement as a “beauty of a breakout.” He highlighted that both funding rates and the perpetual futures basis remained flat, which usually precedes a strong market move. “That’s a beauty of a breakout. Funding + perps basis flat. Weekly close in 1H + weekly candle is a ginormous pinbar with an 8% wick (high probability reversal candle). Full send,” he stated. The technical analysis shows Bitcoin breaking a descending trendline that has been in place since it peaked at about $72,000 in early June. The break through this trendline on the 4-hour Binance chart, as noted by CRG, signals a potential reversal from the recent bearish trend. Moreover, the BTC weekly close presents a significant bullish signal—a large pinbar candle with an 8% wick—indicating potential for upward movement. At press time, BTC traded at $63,232.

The integrated offering combines custody, trading, borrowing, and yield services through separately managed accounts.  Abra, the digital asset prime services and wealth management platform, has launched Abra Treasury, a service for corporates that want to hold crypto on their balance sheet as a reserve asset, the company said in a press release on Monday.  The service will be operated by Abra Capital Management, which is an SEC-registered investment advisor, and will provide corporates, family offices, and non-profits with a range of digital asset treasury management solutions.  Abra Treasury’s offering combines custody, trading, borrowing, and yield services and clients can hold their crypto in separately managed clients, allowing them to retain title and ownership over their digital assets, the company said.  The current uncertain macro environment, characterized by higher inflationary pressures and rising geopolitical tension, has forced some corporate treasurers to consider adding bitcoin {{BTC}} as a reserve asset to their balance sheets.  MicroStrategy (MSTR) is the largest corporate holder of bitcoin, with a stash of 226,331 tokens. The Nasdaq-listed software firm led by Michael Saylor started accumulating the oldest cryptocurrency in 2020.  “A sign of adoption and institutionalization of the digital asset industry has been the increase in non-crypto-native businesses showing interest in using bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset,” said Marissa Kim, head of asset management at Abra Capital Management.  “We are increasingly seeing clients that are business owners and CEOs of small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs), in particular real estate companies, with interest in buying BTC for their treasury or borrowing against BTC to finance business needs or real estate projects, which we did not see last cycle,” Kim said in the release.  Abra and its founder and CEO William “Bill” Barhydt settled with 25 state financial regulators for operating its mobile application without the proper licenses, according to an announcement on Wednesday from the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS). Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Abra will return up to $82.1 million in crypto to U.S. customers in the settling states.

In addition to the new crop of exchanges, liquidity providers B2C2, IMC and Laser Digital, and software vendors Talos and TT have also joined Hidden Road.  Hidden Road, a global credit network for institutions that includes trading in digital assets, said it added a clutch of major exchanges to its prime brokerage platform. It also expanded the use of BlackRock’s BUIDL token by accepting it as collateral across its network.  The company is now integrated with Coinbase International Exchange (following a tie-up with Coinbase Exchange in 2022), OKX (including Nitro Spreads), Deribit (including options), Bitfinex, Bullish (the owner of CoinDesk), AsiaNext and SIX Digital Exchange, the company said in a press release on Monday.  With interest rates running high, institutions trading digital assets in the hundreds of millions of dollars are not going to miss out on circa 5% virtually risk-free from holding a BlackRock money market fund token. Any non-carry asset is going to be a challenge when clients can use BlackRock’s BUIDL token as collateral and to earn interest, said Michael Higgins, Hidden Road's global head of business development.  “Clients can post collateral to Hidden Road in the form of the BUIDL token, and we would recognize that as good margin,” Higgins said in an interview. “Hidden Road then finances those trades on the relevant exchange with, say, USDT or USDC, so the client can actually trade while posting assets to us that earn interest.”  Owing to its existing partnership with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), Hidden Road can also cross margin and margin finance digital asset tokens such as BUIDL on the CME, Higgins said.  “Previously, a client could only post bitcoin as collateral and Hidden Road would provide margin financing to trade on the CME. But of course the bitcoin didn't earn interest. Now they can still do that, but they could also post BUIDL as collateral and we'll fund them dollars on the CME. The difference is that with BUIDL, they earn interest,” he said. “As far as we know, we are the only clearing firm that allows customers to post digital assets as margin to trade on the CME.”  In addition to the new exchanges, liquidity providers B2C2, IMC and Laser Digital, and software vendors Talos and TT have also joined Hidden Road.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/07/01/prime-broker-hidden-road-adds-major-crypto-exchanges-expands-use-of-blackrocks-buidl-token,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1a25e7b4ccc7347c54083a12ef126f9f2beb9476-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42417864,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTa57d,1719816334,"Bitcoin's Potential Rebound May Face Resistance at $65K, OnChain Analysis Shows","Short-term holder wallets are in the red and may liquidate near their breakeven level at $65,000.  Long-term holder wallets, with average cost of less than $20,000, are incentivized to hold or boost their coin stash.  As bitcoin {{BTC}} looks to recover from the July loss, new challenges loom, with onchain data suggesting a potential resistance at $65,000.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value traded nearly 1% higher at $63,200 as of writing, looking to regain some poise after ending June with a 7% loss. June's drop, which reversed May's upswing, mainly occurred due to miner selling and concerns that ETF inflows represent non-directional arbitrage bets instead of outright bullish bets.  Notably, the decline has pushed prices well below the widely tracked aggregate cost basis of short-term bitcoin holders, or wallets storing cost for 155 days or less. As of writing, the aggregate cost basis for short-term holders was $65,000, according to data source LookIntoBitcoin. Onchain analytics firms consider realized price as the aggregate cost basis, reflecting the average price at which coins were last spent on-chain.  In other words, short-term holders now face losses or hold positions in the red and could attempt to exit the market at a loss or breakeven, potentially adding to selling pressure near $65,000.  ""The price of bitcoin has fallen below the aggregate cost basis of short-term holders for the first time since August 2023. In the short-term, we should expect some resistance around the ~$65,000 level as short-term market speculators may look to exit their positions at a 'breakeven' level,"" analysts at Blockware Intelligence said in the latest edition of the newsletter.  ""Last summer when BTC lost the STH RP [realized price] support level, price traded sideways for another two months before finally breaking out again,"" analysts added.  Meanwhile, long-term holder wallets are strongly incentivized to maintain or boost their coin stash as their average cost is less than $20,000, per LookIntoBitcoin. Yes, you read it right; their average cost basis is nearly 70% less than the BTC's going market price.  Besides, bitcoin's 15% price pullback from the record high of over $73,500 in March may appear substantial for a traditional market investor, but is a normal bull market correction for a long-term crypto holder.  ""During the 2017 cycle BTC had 10 drawdowns of 20% or more. This is a normal, healthy, bull market correction.
