42398943,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhjM4,1458686225,German Tech Magazine t3n Trials Employee Bitcoin Payroll,"German tech magazine t3n has announced it will now allow employees to receive a portion of their salary in bitcoin.  The news is the result of a partnership between t3n and local bitcoin startup PEYhttps://pey.de/payroll, which is now developing a payment solution for bitcoin merchants with US-based startup BitPay.  t3n said it has been conducting a trial of the payroll service since November, with employees receiving €20 worth of bitcoin with each paycheck. From here, however, workers will be able to adjust this payment, depending on their risk tolerance.  In a blog post, the magazine said it sought to embark on the trial as a way to boost the wider bitcoin ecosystem and to learn more about the technology, writing:  ""One motivation to implement the new form of salary payment, of course, is in our editorial related interest in new technologies and their adaptation by users in everyday life.""  t3n went on to say that it was keen to shed the ""observer role"" and get involved in exploring the potential applications for its business.  A notable value-add for t3n employees is that the company is offering bitcoin as a tax-free benefit due to the fact that the digital currency is not considered legal tender in Germany.  PEY’s bitcoin payroll service is currently only available in the German market, though the startup indicated it is seeking to roll it out to employers in more countries in the coming months.

42398948,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhjSx,1458679501,2017 or 2025? Securities Firms Debate Timeline for Industry-Grade Blockchain,"A professional forum hosted by an international securities trade group in Boston earlier this week showcased how that industry is looking at potential blockchain applications – and what form those potential use cases might take in the years ahead.  The International Securities Association For Institutional Trade Communication (ISITC) event, held yesterday, featured a number of panels that offered details on how the securities trade ecosystem is reacting to interest in distributed ledgers as well as the broader FinTech movement.  The day of panels kicked off with a keynote address by Wall Street Journal reporter Paul Vigna and MIT Media Lab advisor Michael Casey. The authors of ""The Age of Cryptocurrency,"" Casey and Vigna painted a picture of the growth of bitcoin and blockchain in broad strokes, offering their view on both the rewards and risks of the emerging technology.  However, the major event of the day was a panel devoted to blockchain applications.  Moderated by DTCC chief technology architect Robert Palatnick, the panel featured Chris Church, chief business development officer for Digital Asset Holdings; Todd McDonald, co-founder and COO of blockchain consortium startup R3CEV; and Alistair Milne, professor of financial economics for the Loughborough University School of Business and Economics.  Among the major arguments of the day was that the next year or two will see early growth and, perhaps, the first production-scale distributed ledgers going live.  ""Will it be securities markets where big change happens?"" Milne asked during the panel. ""I think actually retail payments might be a big development, but this depends a lot on the central banks.""  Church said that it could be as many as 10 years before the 'tipping point' of the technology is close to being achieved, remarking:  ""If 2015 was the year we work up to blockchain, 2016 is the year people are running their proof of concepts. 2017 is when you’ll see the first live applications. 2020 is when you’ll see significant adoption, and in 2025 we’ll see a tipping point in some markets. That’s 10 years out.""  McDonald, who hinted at his firm’s work on a ""shared ledger approach"" for financial institutions, suggested that 2016 would be the year of foundation building, with 2017 as a year of potentially big moves.  ""I don't think you'll see any integrations or live systems this year. Next year you’ll see a lot of activity,"" he said.  Industry perspectives  Notably, some of the panel questions turned to the specific work being done by the two blockchain startups – R3CEV and Digital Asset – represented onstage.  For example, Palatnick asked McDonald about lessons learned during a recent industry experiment in which 40 banks utilized five blockchain vendors to simulate the trade of commercial debt.  McDonald remarked:  ""We learned a few things, most of it we learned about how to bring the banks themselves together. I think some of the challenges we said before – trying to impart change on a marketplace is a very small percentage on the technology side.""  During the panel, Church lobbied for the Hyperledger project, the open-source blockchain initiative led by the Linux Foundation to which Digital Asset is a contributor of code. He also invoked the term 'fabric' – a word brought up more than once over the course of the day that has emerged as nomenclature to describe the network connectivity sought by those pursuing applications of blockchain tech.  ""I'd like the see the Hyperledger project become the de facto fabric preferred for the industry. Blockchain needs a standard core fabric at the base level,"" he said. ""The good and the great – some people – there’s a stack of really important people committed to the Hyperledger project.""  Church went on to suggest that the technology, whichever its iteration, could have a lasting impact on how financial markets operate.  ""This isn’t going to change the industry we’ve been in for so many years. It’s going to transform it,"" he said.  Future of utilities  While not specifically focused on blockchain tech, the subject emerged during a panel focused on the future of utilities in the securities trade ecosystem.  The panel featured Vijay Mayadas, SVP of strategy, mergers and acquisitions for Broadridge Financial Solutions; Gene Mockler, senior business manager for SWIFT North America’s market infrastructures and initiatives team; Robert Moitoso, SVP and general manager of financial markets for SS&C Technologies; and Matthew Nelson, managing director of global product and strategy for DTCC. Dayle Scher, a senior analyst for the TABB Group, served as moderator.  Moitoso, whose firm specializes in cloud-based financial services technology, divulged that a team devoted to blockchain applications at SS&C has developed an early proof of concept focused on securities.  He explained:  ""At SS&C we have a team that is actively working on blockchain technology. We recently completed a proof-of-concept around settlement for securitized bank loans. It's still early, early days, and we continue to refine it.""  Mayadas said that his firm is ""a long-term believer in blockchain"", a characteristic reflected in its participation in the recent $60m funding round of Digital Asset Holdings.  Nelson later spoke about the chilling effect of the Silk Road – the now-defunct dark market that utilized bitcoin as a currency – on financial services’ exploration of the technology.  ""That’s still the mindset. It’s got be detached from some of these concepts that are out there, and that will take some time. I think that’s part of it, because we are dealing with a highly regulated industry,"" he said, later describing it as ""a lot of hand-holding with the regulators"".  Mockler said that while SWIFT North America is pushing ahead with work on the technology, the company still sees problems that require addressing - a common refrain among financial professionals, including those present at the conference.  ""We’re doing a lot of work across the industry. We’ve built a technology within our own labs. We have concerns – we have questions, that’s a better way of saying it, around scalability, security, and identity management,"" he said, concluding:  ""There’s a number of issues and questions to be resolved.""

42398934,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhjEC,1458668408,Roger Ver Issues $100k Bitcoin Bounty for Bernie Sanders Debate,"Roger Ver has offered US presidential candidate Bernie Sanders $100,000 in the form of a bitcoin donation he'll make in his name to a charity if he'll engage in a debate with Iraq War veteran and talk show host Adam Kokesh.  The offer made in a video posted to Kokesh’s YouTube channel is in response to video posted by the Occupy Democrats in which Sanders talks about wealthy US citizens renouncing their citizenship.  ""Your policies are clearly intended to help,"" Ver, a bitcoin angel investor and advisor to wallet service Blockchain, said in the video. ""But it seems you don't see how they are backed up by violence.""  In the video, Ver takes issue with the payment of taxes as a means to fund the wars Sanders has widely spoken out against. Ver, who renounced his US citizenship, denounced the idea of patriotism and called on the wealthiest 1% of the US population to stop paying taxes.  In the Bernie Sanders speech, which was edited together with images of US citizens who have purportedly renounced their citizenship — including Ver — the Democratic presidential candidate and Senator from Vermont questions wealthy US citizen who fled to other countries.  ""These great lovers of America who made their money in this country,"" Sanders said in a speech used in edited form in the video. ""When you ask them to start paying their fair share of taxes they’re running abroad.""  Ver’s offer to make a donation in Sanders’s name to a non-governmental entity is a common practice during election season. In Ver's case, Sanders would have to engage in a three-hour debate with Kokesh, who made headlines in 2014 after he received no jail time following controversial drug and gun-related convictions.  Ver said he’ll make the donation in bitcoin in Sanders’ name with ""some of the tax money I saved by renouncing my US citizenship.""

42398940,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhjJ7,1458664557,Doubt Cast on ASX Blockchain Trial as CEO Resigns,"The Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) CEO who championed the company's adoption of blockchain technology has resigned amid accusations of bribery against his previous company.  In the search for a replacement, it remains to be seen if Elmer Funke Kupper's resignation will impact a wide range of plans for the exchange. Local news sources are already beginning to speculate the transition could impact those that were perhaps more controversial, such as its investment in blockchain technology.  For example, a report by The Australian today cited analysts that indicated Funke Kupper's successor may be likely to review the ASX's decision to fund blockchain development.  The report reads:  ""ASX is due to review the investment and decide whether to proceed next year. Deputy chief executive Peter Hiom yesterday said the exchange did not want to 'put its neck out' but wanted to see the development of a common standard for all market operators.""  A representative from independent investment analyst Morningstar, told the report that a new CEO may decide whether such a strategy was ""worthwhile"", and that costs could be revisited.  ""I can see the merits in trying to be the first in the world but it is a small exchange and the cost might be too much,"" analyst Nathan Zaia said.  ASX joined a group of international investors, including JPMorgan and Santander InnoVentures in a $50m investment in blockchain startup Digital Asset Holdings, in January.  ASX invested a total of 14.9m Australian dollars to acquire a 5% stake in the company and fund early development for its blockchain project.  Allegations  Funke Kupper has denied any wrongdoing and his previous company, Tabcorp Holdings, has made no admission regarding the allegations, according to a Business Spectator report.  Previously, Funke Cooper had worked as CEO of Tabcorp, a Melbourne-based entertainment company. Tabcorp allegedly paid $200,000 to a consulting company associated with the Cambodia’s Prime Minister’s family.  The payment in question would have coincided with an investigation into a potential online gaming license.  Digital Asset Holdings did not respond to requests for further comment.

42398953,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhjVu,1458658177,Bitcoin Startups Eye Ethereum As Platform's Profile Grows,"Following the launch of the first production-ready version of Ethereum this month, bitcoin businesses are moving to investigate how they might apply the blockchain platform as part of their existing products or services.  So far, startups as diverse as cloud money platform Uphold, bitcoin mining firm BTCS and hardware device provider Ledger are among those that have announced Ethereum initiatives. And in what may be one of the most high-profile signs of interest, bitcoin startup Coinbase plans to hold an internal event on the platform this week.  However, exactly how these companies will seek to use Ethereum, and whether they will do so in a way that is consistent with the vision of the next-generation blockchain platform remains unclear. Announced in 2014, Ethereum is distinguished by its support for smart contracts and ability to support decentralized applications or dapps.  Despite these wide uses, interviews suggest bitcoin startups are adding support for Ethereum through services that aim to boost the liquidity of its transaction token, ether, and that while they are excited about its larger potential, they’re not sure how to define this opportunity or what it may mean for their business.  Uphold  EVP Jorge Pereira, for example, said that his firm is seeking to add support for ether as a first step, but that it will remain open to other applications as they emerge. Still, he spoke to overall change in perception that has brought about this shift.  Pereira told CoinDesk:  ""Before, Ethereum was a curiosity. No one knew whether it would take off. Now it’s achieved a number of goals that make it something that has sizeable potential. The first thing we can easily do is provide support for holding and converting ether, however, with Ethereum we don’t see the goal being that.""  Elsewhere, members of the bitcoin community struck similar tones.  Ledger co-founder Thomas France noted his firm sees its support of Ethereum as a necessary step toward applying its technology to a wider variety of blockchains. Ledger recently announced support for Eris Industries, for example, which offers permissioned blockchain solutions.  ""The core of our business is to provide ways to leverage secure hardware for developers and companies,"" France told CoinDesk.  Other industry businesses have sought to offer services for those seeking to buy or sell ethers in a similar manner as digital currencies, even as the platform's creators indicate ether is not meant to be a payment method or store of value.  Tapping new markets  Of interest for many of those interviewed was finding new lines of business. The statements suggest Ethereum may become a way for some firms to seek to grow their market size at a time when adoption of bitcoin as a digital currency appears to be stalling.  BitGo  engineer Jameson Lopp, for example, said that the bitcoin wallet and security specialist is discussing whether it would be worth developing a wallet for the blockchain platform, though he cautioned such talks remain in early stages.  ""Our business is helping people secure crypto. It mainly comes down to how much demand there is to secure ether from institutions,"" he said.  Not all those who are interested have a long-term focus in mind, however. Charles Allen, CEO of bitcoin mining outfit BTCS, noted that his firm recently built custom Ethereum mining rigs as part of a pilot program due to the escalating price of ether.  In recent weeks, ether has been one of the more volatile currencies, rising to highs of around $13, up about $10 from six months ago. Allen indicated that BTCS is well-positioned to roll out hardware for Ethereum mining, given its background in creating specialized hardware for bitcoin mining.  “You can’t ignore [Ethereum] right now, at this price level, with a $1bn market cap,” Allen said in a recent interview.  He went on to indicate that the pilot seeks to examine whether mining Ethereum would be profitable given that it plans to transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake mining, meaning eventually, its transaction verification process would transition to the point where it would not require hardware.  Still, he said that since Ethereum runs on graphics processing units (GPUs), it’s possible for the company to resell the hardware it purchases.  ""For us, this is opportunistic. You can’t mine Ethereum forever, [but] if we can jump in and make some money it makes a lot of sense,"" he said.  'Unfortunate' attempts  In interview, representatives of the Ethereum project reported mixed feelings about the recent trend.  The platform’s inventor, Vitalik Buterin, noted he has been disappointed by how bitcoin industry firms are seeking to leverage the technology, noting that, to date, most initiatives have failed to ""capture what the platform is about"".  He told CoinDesk:  ""Some of that is fairly simple, there’s [we accept] bitcoin, we’re just going to accept ether, which is nice, but it’s kind of unfortunate. The whole thing is to do all the blockchain stuff other than currency.""  Buterin suggested that many industry firms haven’t digested the platform’s value propositions, which he acknowledged may be more abstract than bitcoin’s, and to an extent, a threat to some industry business models.  “A more traditional company might ask can we accept ether. But, that’s not the point. The point is that you will be replaced by a smart contract that is fully autonomous and doesn’t charge fees,"" he remarked.  Still, there are problems in the Ethereum ecosystem that Buterin indicated he hopes innovators in the bitcoin space and beyond will solve.  For instance, he pointed to the centralization of Ethereum’s mining poolshttps://etherchain.org/statistics/miners and the relative newness of its wallet applications as areas where it could benefit from the knowledge of other open-source technology communities.  Wait and see  Interviews suggest that these opportunities are resonating with industry businesses, even those that may have just taken initial steps to embrace ether.  For example, Andrew Lee, CEO of bitcoin deals platform Purse, noted that his startup is accepting ether, but that it has explored how Ethereum could be used to automate certain parts of the online commerce process and as part of conversations about the future of supply chains.  Lee suggested it remains to be seen whether applications like smart contracts become a use case for Ethereum, or if other efforts are successful at replicating this functionality on the bitcoin blockchain, an idea industry startup RSK Labs has raised $1m to undertake.  ""I think what I foresee is there will be a limit to what bitcoin can do, and if we get there, Ethereum would be a good alternative,"" Lee said.  Others noted that this exploration process is likely to take time, and that the ecosystem can be expected to continue to look for ways to apply Ethereum as the project matures.  Pereira added:  ""With Ethereum, we’re still figuring it out as a community.""
