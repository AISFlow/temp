However, a trading firm suggests that Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) falling below a crucial level could signal the start of the long-anticipated altcoin season. Interest Rate Cuts, Trump Administration To Propel Crypto In a recent Telegram broadcast, Singapore-based trading firm QCP Capital shared its crypto market analysis. The firm highlighted Solana’s (SOL) recent performance, noting that it outpaced Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) over the weekend, surging more than 17% from Friday’s lows. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Market Is Still In An ‘Healthy Growth’ Phase, Says Analyst—Here’s Why Despite this, QCP Capital acknowledged that many investors remain hesitant to embrace the prospect of an imminent alt season, given Bitcoin’s steady climb toward the psychologically significant $100,000 mark. Rekt Capital’s analysis supports this sentiment, suggesting BTC is just beginning its parabolic phase. QCP Capital, however, predicted that a combination of Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election and interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed) could set the stage for a full-blown altcoin season in the coming months. Trading Firm Identifies Key Bitcoin Dominance Threshold For Altseason According to QCP Capital, altcoins historically outperform major cryptocurrencies once the latter consolidate after significant rallies. The firm explained: Historically, we’ve seen altcoins outperform whenever the majors consolidate after a significant rally as profits rotate into smaller-cap coins. BTC’s dominance is around 60% now and it will probably need to be around <58% to signal the start of altcoin season. Currently, BTC.D stands at 60.10%. A look at the weekly chart shows that Bitcoin dominance has been on a steady uptrend since November 2022, when it hovered at 39.92%. Over this two-year period, most altcoins have underperformed Bitcoin significantly. However, altcoins have recently shown signs of recovery, coinciding with the growing likelihood of a pro-crypto Trump administration. Digital assets like SOL, Cardano (ADA), and XRP have significantly outperformed BTC in the past few weeks. Related Reading: Ethereum Analyst Sees Altseason Potential As BTS Is Still Outpacing ETH – Time To Buy Altcoins? QCP Capital’s analysis aligns with that of crypto analyst @MikybullCrypto, who predicts BTC.D will decline starting in December. According to the analyst, altseason could begin toward the end of November and last until March 2025. Some analysts believe Bitcoin may continue its rally before showing signs of weakness. For instance, Fundstrat’s head of research, Tom Lee, recently stated that BTC is on track to reach $100,000 before the end of the year. That said, the altcoin market cap recently surged past a key resistance level, indicating that altcoin season might be closer than expected. At press time, BTC trades at $91,760, trading flat in the past 24 hours.

42435313,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kotnG,1732055197,Trump Said to Consider Crypto Lawyer Teresa Goody Guillén to Lead SEC,"The Trump transition team is considering Teresa Goody Guillén, partner at law firm BakerHostetler and co-lead of its blockchain team, among several candidates to become the next SEC chair, industry sources said.  Goody Guillén is a seasoned securities lawyer with experience serving the SEC and opposing the agency on behalf of blockchain companies and traditional businesses.  President-elect Trump is seeking a pro-crypto non-bureaucrat to drastically overhaul the SEC with light-touch regulation, the sources said.  Teresa Goody Guillén, a veteran of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, is among the candidates president-elect Donald Trump is considering to lead the agency, people familiar with the situation said.  Goody Guillén is a partner at law firm BakerHostetler and co-lead of its blockchain practice. Crypto companies are privately advocating for her to head the regulator based on her experience serving the SEC and opposing the agency on behalf of blockchain companies and traditional Wall Street firms.  ""She is the best candidate of all the people that are currently being opined on,” said Brendan Playford, co-founder of Masa, a token-powered decentralized data provider for AI companies. Goody Guillén would make immediate changes to the SEC, he said.  “She has a clear understanding of the laws, has a clear understanding of the way the SEC works,” Playford said. “We would just have an instant change maker that would dramatically transform the industry with someone that's very pro-crypto.”  Goody Guillén declined to comment for this story. A request for comment from Trump transition team spokesperson Karoline Leavitt went unanswered.  Crypto professionals have the Trump team's ear in the selection process following a campaign in which the industry spent over $130 million on the former president and other Republican candidates. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong reportedly met privately with Trump to discuss personnel appointments.  Goody Guillén enters a competitive shortlist to replace SEC chair Gary Gensler, who began referring to his job in the past tense last week and is expected to step down before Trump’s inauguration on January 20. SEC chairs customarily resign during the transition to a new administration. On the campaign trail, Trump vowed to “fire” Gensler on the first day of his presidency.  Other SEC chair candidates reportedly include Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP partner Robert Stebbins, Paul Hastings partner Brad Bondi, former SEC commissioner Paul Atkins, Robinhood chief legal officer Dan Gallagher, and former acting Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks.  'Tough as hell'  According to her LinkedIn page, Goody Guillén was an attorney for the Office of the General Counsel at the SEC from 2009 to 2011, when Mary Shapiro became the first woman to head the agency.  Later, as chief operating officer and managing director at Kalorama Partners, Goody Guillén worked with former SEC chair Harvey Pitt advising clients against SEC enforcement cases..  The Trump transition team is seeking an overhaul of the SEC and looking for a pro-business non-bureaucrat who will unwind the expanded agency created under Gensler’s tenure, and end the practice of ""regulation by enforcement action,"" according to three people with knowledge of the matter.  In terms of crypto, the Trump team wants someone who understands the industry and will exercise restraint when it comes to applying securities laws to digital assets until clear legislation is passed by Congress, the sources said,  Peers described Goody Guillén as embodying these principles.  “She is understated … but she's tough as hell,” said Charley Cooper, senior advisor at digital asset solutions provider R3 and a former chief operating officer at the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. “She would govern based on substantive understanding of securities laws as they apply to the traditional markets, as well as to crypto, and she will dramatically roll back the prior administration's default to regulating through enforcement and arbitrarily reading into statutes written 90 years ago.""  Nicole Trudeau, general counsel for investment firm Wave Digital Assets, has worked with Goody Guillén on a number of crypto-related bankruptcies and SEC receiverships.  “Teresa is a true trailblazer in the crypto space, bringing the expertise and vision needed to lead the SEC and drive the growth of U.S. crypto and capital markets,” said Trudeau. “She embodies everything President Trump envisioned for the sector.”  Wasting no time  Unlike the first Trump administration, this second term selection process is rapid and organized, Washington insiders said. An SEC chair is expected to be chosen before Thanksgiving.  Trump has named his transition team co-chair, Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick, as commerce secretary.

Despite XRP’s recent bullish momentum breakthrough to the $1 mark, the analyst has revealed that XRP is showcasing a Gravestone DOJI candlestick formation, signaling a bearish outlook for the cryptocurrency. XRP Price Expected To Crash 40% A crypto analyst identified as ‘Without Worries’ on TradingView has released a detailed analysis of the XRP price action, projecting a 40% crash in the short term. The analyst emphasized that this 40% decline could happen in days, with XRP set to witness a significant reversal from its recent price highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Forms Bullish Pennant That Shows Surge To $113,000 Is Coming, Here’s How According to the TradingView crypto expert, the XRP price action witnessed an impressive 150% gain over the past 10 days. This price increase fueled its rise to the $1 milestone for the first time in three years. Despite these bullish developments, the analyst has highlighted several reasons and technical indicators that point to an imminent trend reversal and price correction for XRP. In the XRP price chart, the analyst identified and confirmed the Gravestone DOJI, a bearish candlestick pattern that appears during market tops and signals the potential for a price correction. The Gravestone DOJI candle indicates that buyers who had tried to push the price of XRP higher were significantly overwhelmed by sellers set on profit-taking. Another indicator that suggests that the XRP price could be preparing for a significant correction is the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) support breakouts. The RSI measures the speed and changes in an asset’s price movements, indicating whether it is overbought or sold. On the other hand, the MFI considers both price and volume, highlighting where the money is flowing. A support breakout in XRP’s RSI signals a potential trend reversal due to an overbought market. A breakout in MFI, which the analyst has stated is a very noteworthy indicator, suggests that funds are leaving an asset, ultimately signaling weakening buying pressure. More Factors That Suggest An Upcoming Crash As mentioned earlier, the TradingView analyst has predicted that the XRP price may crash by 40%, meaning the cryptocurrency could drop from its current value of $1.11 to $0.66. In addition to the factors above, the market expert has stated that XRP’s price action is currently outside the Bollinger bands, which measure an asset’s price volatility. Related Reading: Ethereum Sees $1 Billion Exchange Outflow Alongside Bitcoin: What This Means For Price The analyst has revealed that 95% of price actions occur within the bands. Hence, prices outside the Bollinger bands often signal a pullback or correction toward the mean point at $0.73. Moreover, he noted that the bands are curving inwards, suggesting that XRP buyers may be exhausted, increasing the likelihood of a price reversal. Furthermore, the TradingView crypto analyst highlighted that most traders are either long or bullish on XRP, which is a contrarian signal for the cryptocurrency’s price outlook. While he acknowledges a possibility for a continuous upward trend for XRP, the analyst has also noted that present indicators suggest a low probability.

The wallet is handy and combines cross-platform access with select, advanced functionalities, as well as an intuitive interface. This makes it an especially great fit for both crypto professionals and amateur users. Here’s a more comprehensive breakdown of NOW Wallet’s extensive offerings and their benefits. 1. Non-Custodial Access One central NOW Wallet feature is that it is non-custodial. This is to say: a user’s private keys remain in their hands, allowing for greater financial autonomy and security. No external actors – not even the wallet provider – have access to the funds. As such, NOW Wallet’s approach to asset management shields against the risk of centralized failures. These are more common with custodial wallets. Also, in being non-custodial, NOW Wallet doesn’t collect users’ private data and aligns itself with one of core principles of the crypto space, which is privacy. 2. Security Features Security is a non-negotiable aspect of any crypto wallet. Fortunately, NOW Wallet delivers on that end. The ChangeNOW team outfitted the wallet with certain key security features. First is the standard mnemonic phrase encryption. Users are provided with a 12 or 24-word mnemonic recovery phrase. Which will come in handy when users lose access to their wallet and need to recover it. Most importantly, NOW Wallet features a three-layer encryption process to safeguard sensitive data like private keys. This is in addition to biometric authentication. NOW Wallet users can pair the traditional pin-based access with fingerprint or facial scans for extra protection. Additionally, NOW Wallet includes one interesting and unique security feature. This function allows users to adjust visibility and access. They can opt to display certain currencies on their main screen and leave out others. Users can also hide wallets with zero balances or those flagged as scams. This also allows for a well-organized and easy-to-navigate interface. 3. Extensive Blockchain and Currency Support NOW Wallet is interoperable with over 50 blockchain networks. The list covers popular names such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), TRON, and Binance Smart Chain, as well as other less-known networks. Additionally, the wallet supports more than 1500 digital assets. It is also compatible with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Ethereum and Solana. NFT enthusiasts can use NOW Wallet to store, view, and manage their collections. Moreover, users with existing crypto portfolios can also import them from popular apps like Trust and Exodus with 12 or 24-word mnemonic phrases, making the management of investments super easy. 4. DeFi Integration NOW Wallet’s functionality also extends to DeFi users. One can easily link the wallet to decentralized apps and services. This is possible thanks to solutions such as WalletConnect and TRONConnect. Likewise, the wallet includes features to facilitate POS crypto payments. In collaboration with NOWPayments, NOW Wallet allows businesses or individuals to process crypto in exchange for goods and services. 5. In-Wallet Exchange, Fiat-to-Crypto Conversion, and Staking NOW Wallet incorporates features from ChangeNOW, so has in-built exchange options and fiat-to-crypto onramp. Users can swiftly conduct crypto-to-crypto transactions starting at just $2, including cross-chain swaps, which enable direct exchanges between different blockchain networks. NOW Wallet also allows for purchasing digital assets with over 60 fiat currencies using Visa/Mastercard, bank transfers, and Apple/Google Pay. Furthermore, users can directly stake cryptocurrencies such as ChangeNOW’s native NOW token, alongside ATOM, TRX, SOL, BNB, XTZ, and ADA. This way, the wallet eliminates third-party involvement in the staking process. Hence, one can earn their rewards and still retain control over their assets. 6. Cross-Platform Compatibility NOW Wallet is available across a glut of operating systems: from Android, iOS, and Windows, to MacOS and Linux users. Microsoft Store and Google Play both host the wallet app for Windows and Android users. HarmonyOS users can also download the NOW Wallet from the Huawei App Gallery. Apple enthusiasts have dedicated apps with iOS, Mac, and iPad compatibility. For users looking to escape the radar of popular stores, you can also choose to download the APK right from the wallet’s website. Overall, NOW Wallet’s flexibility demonstrates its interest in serving users, which ties into this next point. 7. Low-Barrier Entry and User-Friendliness A core feature of any good wallet is ease of access. The wallet’s design simplifies processes such as buying, selling, and storing digital assets among others. NOW Wallet features a universal QR scanner that eases transactions. It works by swiftly capturing wallet addresses or initiating WalletConnect actions. With just a scan users can send or receive funds. NOW Wallet strives to toe the line between simple and innovative. Even as it continues to roll out features, things are kept accessible so users have a hitch-free experience. Additionally, NOW Wallet helps its users stay on top of wallet activity. This occurs through real-time push notifications to alert users of all happenings. 8. Pro Features NOW Wallet offers advanced functionality for users who want more than the basic options. These features help to elevate the overall wallet experience. For instance, the wallet pairs cashback rewards with in-app exchanges. This incentivizes users to conduct transactions via the wallet app. Also, NOW Wallet users have access to crypto loans via ChangeNOW Pro. They can borrow against their assets to gain additional funds. This is a great option for users who need liquidity but do not want to let go of their tokens. Other Pro features include AML security checks, reduced fees for off-chain transactions, and own private webpages to receive crypto payments. Drawbacks of the NOW Wallet Here’s a look at some possible drawbacks of the NOW Wallet: 9. Reliance on Third-Party Services NOW Wallet’s default position is its non-custodial approach to asset holding. However, some of its features call for third-party services like WalletConnect and fiat-to-crypto gateways Simplex, Transak, and Guardarian. While wallet access remains within user control, some functionality may rely on the security of external platforms. 10. Extra Costs NOW Wallet has many free features but that is not always the case. Some of its advanced offerings, including several Pro packages, may incur additional payments. Additionally, as with other crypto wallets, transaction fees can increase during times of high network activity. However, it’s important to note that NOW Wallet doesn’t impose any extra charges, and final rates vary depending on the blockchain or other relevant parties, such as payment service providers. How To Start With NOW Wallet First, install NOW Wallet via Google Play, App Store, Huawei Smart Gallery, or Microsoft Store. You may also choose to download the APK right from the website. Next, simply follow the step-by-step instructions to create and set up your new wallet. Be sure to securely record your seed phrase. After setting up your wallet, select the option you’re interested in whether it’s send, receive, exchange, buy, or stake. To Buy Cryptocurrency Click the Buy tab Then, select the token you’d like to purchase Select a payment method Enter your card details and follow the steps for completion Expect your coins to arrive in your NOW Wallet shortly Conclusion NOW Wallet is a multi-faceted tool that can cater to a variety of needs, allowing users to efficiently complete all their processes in one place. Its user-friendly interface, array of features and multi-platform support positions it to be a staple wallet for both amateurs and experienced crypto users. All this contributes to NOW Wallet’s presentation as a well-rounded solution for hosting digital assets .",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH | BNB,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SPONSORED | BNB,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/pros-and-cons-of-now-wallet:-what-you-need-to-know-to-get-started-in-2024-2025,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36607244.jpeg

36605719,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4738789-bakkt-q3-earnings-and-tmtg-buyout-rumors?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,1732050419,Bakkt: Q3 Earnings And TMTG Buyout Rumors,"Summary Bakkt's stock surged due to buyout rumors involving Trump Media and Technology Group, despite ongoing financial challenges. Bakkt's Q3 earnings showed a 60% YoY top-line revenue increase, but the company continues to burn capital with a $27.4 million operating loss. Bakkt's long-term transacting account metrics are declining, with a 42% drop over the last year. Given the potential all-stock transaction, selling the buyout rumor is likely a more favorable outcome than the buyout itself for BKKT shareholders. For TMTG, the company has plenty of cash to do the deal without diluting DJT shareholders. An all-stock deal would be a savvy way to capitalize on a grossly overvalued stock. It's been over a year and half since I last covered Bakkt Holdings ( BKKT ) for Seeking Alpha. At the time of my prior article, I called the company a 'hold' and noted cash burn and US regulations as important problems Bakkt was facing: Without the central bank liquidity spigot, the retail investor demand for cryptos will likely be limited. Furthermore, without clearly defined regulatory parameters from the US government, institutional demand will likely be limited as well. In the twelve months following that article, shares of BKKT fell by over 80% before the company did a 1 for 25 reverse split in late April of this year. Today, we find the value of post-reverse split BKKT shares now right back where they were when I wrote that late April piece in 2023: Data by YCharts What changed? Well, Bakkt is now involved in a buyout rumor. And not just any buyout rumor; a buyout rumor that involves President Donald Trump's media company Trump Media and Technology Group (NASDAQ: DJT ). To put this in perspective, one of my primary concerns related to BKKT last year was the regulatory environment in the United States. To say that the regulatory environment will be changing in 2025 is likely an understatement. If the incoming president is indeed trying to buy a cryptocurrency business, it should be a clear indication that the next administration will not just be less antagonistic to digital assets, but even friendly. However, that alone does not necessarily mean BKKT is a buy on this possible deal and certainly not after such a sizeable run in response to the rumor. In this update, we'll briefly go over what we know about the reported buyout talks as well as look at Bakkt's recently released Q3 earnings report. Takeaways From The Buyout Rumor Speculation about Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG from here) buying out Bakkt originated in a Financial Times article on 11/18/24 . The two sides are apparently in advanced talks according to two different sources claiming to be privy to the negotiations. We don't yet know what the proposed valuation of the buyout would be, but the deal would apparently be an all-stock transaction. I think this is quite telling. Data by YCharts The response to the buyout report from FT sent BKKT shares absolutely flying as the stock nearly tripled the day the FT piece came out. The market value of the company now stands at over $216.5 million. Interestingly, at $372 million in cash and equivalents at the end of September, TMTG has more than enough cash to make this deal without issuing equity at BKKT's current valuation. This is largely speculative as we don't even know for certain whether or not this rumor has any real legs, but if we assume TMTG does want to buy BKKT, the company would rather issue shares than use cash to buy a business that was valued at about $71 million prior to the FT report. One could probably view this as an indication that even TMTG believes its own equity is overvalued. Which really shouldn't come as a surprise as DJT shares are currently trading at about 9x book and 1,400x trailing twelve month sales. All this said, I do suspect there are legs to this rumor for two reasons. First, we know that Donald Trump's team has an interest in cryptocurrency -related businesses since it launched World Liberty Financial earlier this year and has used Polygon ( MATIC-USD )(POL-USD) to sell NFTs. Second, Bakkt issued a ' no comment ' statement following the rumor. If there was nothing to the rumor, I would think Bakkt would say as much. My spidey senses are telling me not only is there something to the rumor, but it's a distinct possibility that the leak may have come from Bakkt. Of course, that is just a guess on my part. I don't have any knowledge of the behind the scenes dealings whatsoever. But Bakkt is clearly benefitting from this speculated buyout more than TMTG if the market is any guide. Bakkt's Q3 Earnings & Balance Sheet Woes For the quarter ended September 2024, Bakkt Holdings reported $328.4 million in total revenue, an increase of 60% year over year. Loyalty services revenue came in at $12.1 million, down 7% from the prior year period. The company noted lower transaction volume as the primary reason for the declines in the loyalty business. Bakkt 10-Q Even before factoring in things like SG&A, Bakkt's crypto services business revenue of $316 million has a gross margin of about 1%. Which I'd say is in-line with what I've seen from retail-facing businesses from companies like Coinbase ( COIN ) but certainly not a huge driver of bottom-line performance. The company continues to burn capital simply by operating, if the $27.4 million Q3 operating loss is any indication. The good news is Bakkt's year to date operating loss at the end of September was only $81.2 million, compared with $149.4 million this time last year. Perhaps seeing the writing on the wall, Bakkt started exploring a 'wind down and dissolution' of Bakkt Trust due to a lack of traction in the market and because of the regulatory requirements associated with operating the business. The company said it's working on strategic alternatives for Bakkt Trust. The KPI graphs below have my crudely drawn arrows in green and red: Q3 KPIs (Bakkt Q3 Investor Deck) While Bakkt highlighted surging transaction volume in November, the company's long-term trend in transacting accounts has been rough. Despite 7% year-over-year growth in crypto-enabled accounts, transacting accounts declined 42% over that same time frame. YoY growth in assets under custody is mainly attributed to increased prices for the coins themselves. All things considered, I'm not surprised Bakkt is entertaining a buyout and I suspect a sale would be the best outcome for BKKT shareholders rather than another quarter of incinerating what little capital the company has left. Bakkt Q3 Earnings Deck At the end of September, Bakkt had just $29 million in cash and equivalents plus $6.7 million in available-for-sale securities. Total assets sat at $1.18 billion against $1.08 in total liabilities. If we strip out the $68 million in Goodwill from the $102 million in stockholder equity, I could argue BKKT shares are worth about $5.40. Investor Takeaways How one views this potential deal likely depends entirely on which side of this possible transaction readers fall on. Consider, Bakkt has no history of ever operating a profitable business, and there is very little in the way of tangible assets owned by the company. That said, TMTG could look at this purely as a 6.5 million client acquisition deal. That probably would have been more palatable at $71 million rather than $216 million. However, since it would be an all-stock deal, it still wouldn't really be that much dilution for DJT shares currently valued at over $7 billion. For BKKT shareholders, I'd argue it makes more sense to just sell this rip now. If we assume a deal happens, and you're getting newly issued DJT shares in exchange for BKKT shares, that may be a good enough reason to take the chips off the table before DJT equity falls back down to earth. I have no position in either stock, and am actually quite excited for a new regulatory regime in the United States. But I think both stocks are still sells on this rumored deal.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | ZRX,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4738789-bakkt-q3-earnings-and-tmtg-buyout-rumors?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36605719.jpeg

36578755,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653953,1732049800,VanEck Gives Official Backing To Donald Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve Strategy,"On Tuesday, Matthew Sigel, the head of digital asset research at asset management firm and crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuer VanEck, officially endorsed President-elect Donald Trump’s proposal for a national strategic Bitcoin reserve. Major Financial Players Align This endorsement comes as discussions about BCT’s role in US economic policy are intensifying, most notably with Dennis Porter, co-founder and CEO of the non-profit Satoshi Action Fund (SAF), reaffirming BlackRock’s support for the strategic Bitcoin reserve. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reaches New High Of $94,000: Blockstream CEO Anticipates $1 Million Ahead Porter emphasized that the Trump administration is actively working towards creating this reserve through an executive order, highlighting a significant alignment among major financial players and lawmakers regarding Bitcoin’s future. During a series of social media posts on X (formerly Twitter), Porter also outlined a series of steps he believes will facilitate the establishment of the strategic Bitcoin reserve, suggesting that the process will begin with Trump appointing a pro-Bitcoin Treasury Secretary. Key Steps For Establishing A US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Porter asserts that Donald Trump would then sign an executive order to create the reserve, which would also involve halting the auction of Bitcoin currently held by the US Marshals Service. The next phase would see the Treasury absorb these Bitcoin assets and place them into the Exchange Stabilization Fund. Over time, the Treasury would continue to accumulate Bitcoin for the reserve. Porter also noted the importance of legislative support, stating that since executive orders can be easily reversed, it would be crucial for Congress to pass a formal bill establishing the strategic reserve, spearheaded by pro-crypto Senator Cynthia Lummis. Related Reading: Solana Analyst Expects A Retrace Before It Breaks ATH – Targets Revealed The potential for a US strategic Bitcoin reserve has generated substantial excitement in the market, contributing to Bitcoin’s recent surge to an all-time high of $94,000. This reflects growing confidence among investors and speculation that such government actions could lead to significant buying pressure and further institutional adoption. At the time of writing, BTC has fallen back to $93,380 after hitting its new all-time high, marking a 40% increase in just two weeks.

The company's Q3 earnings report was pressured by shifting market economics following the Bitcoin halving earlier this year. The company is launching a proprietary AISC Bitcoin mining platform, expected to generate financial efficiencies and drive strong growth. Bitdeer Technologies ( BTDR ) has emerged as a leader in the nascent blockchain industry with a unique business strategy. Recognized as one of the world's largest publicly traded Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miners, the company also develops data center power infrastructure while offering high-performance cloud computing services for AI applications. We covered some of these themes in a bullish article from 2023 and shares are now up nearly 200% over the past year amid the sharp Bitcoin price rally. While we remain constructive on the stock's long-term potential, the next stage of the rally will likely be more difficult. The company's latest quarterly update highlighted ongoing financial headwinds that could keep shares volatile. A more cautious outlook into 2025 may be warranted. Data by YCharts BTDR Q3 Earnings Recap Several moving parts are important to understand the context of Bitdeer Technologies' third-quarter earnings. Revenue of $62 million declined by -29% y/y and the net loss of -$50.1 million widened from -$1.8 million last year. source: company IR Bitdeer is benefiting as the current spot price of Bitcoin above $90k has climbed more than 3-fold from an average of under $30k in Q3 last year. That should be great for the miners and others powering the network and extracting a portion of blockchain protocol rewards. On the one hand, the Bitcoin halving event earlier this year cut the network block reward in half, effectively limiting the potential revenue for all miners. Separately, higher Bitcoin prices continue to attract more miners to the network which has pushed the hash rate difficulty significantly higher this year, further diluting the reward availability per unit of processing power. The impact is evident across the company's operating segments including the 511 self-mined Bitcoin during the quarter, compared to 1,085 in Q3 2023. Given the new market economics, Bitdeer has also faced lower cloud hash rate service contracts as certain customers removed older and less efficient mining rigs from operation. Revenues from general hosting and membership hosting are down sharply from last year. The metric that stands out is the decline in total hash rate under management, falling to 17.1 EH/s from 21.2 EH/s last year. In this case, Bitdeer has shifted some of that capacity towards its self-mining operation, while the business still generated a negative gross profit this quarter. source: company IR SEALMINER optimism into 2025 The understanding is that Bitdeer is in the middle of a transitional period, with several developments in store for 2025 to support an improved outlook. The good news is that a balance sheet cash position of more than $291 million, along with $40 million in cryptocurrency value as of Sep. 30, provides the company with some financial flexibility and time to execute the next stage of its strategy. Bitdeer is betting big on its proprietary SEALMINER hydro-cooled mining rig, which it believes represents a major competitive advantage that can sharply reduce its mining costs and generate greater margins. Compared to its current fleet of 828k mining rigs running with an average efficiency of 31.4 J/TH, the SEALMINER A2 equipped with the in-house SEAL02 chip has already entered the first-run production phase and boasts an efficiency of 16.5 J/TH. If this metric is confirmed, Bitdeer's AISC technology would be competitive with top-of-the-line mining rigs from leading suppliers like "" Bitmain "" at a lower cost. The plan is to run its new rigs for self-mining while commercializing the hardware for external customers into a multi-billion-dollar addressable market as a new revenue and growth driver. That SEALMINER capabilities will be leveraged with significant new power infrastructure capacity expected to come online over the next several quarters. Management is confident that the conversion of 100 MW of hosting capacity at its Texas facility to hydro-cooling by Q1 2025 can bring back some hosting customers. Through 2026, Bitdeer has 1,645 MW of pipeline capacity in progress or under planning that will nearly triple its current 895 NW infrastructure. By this measure, the attraction of Bitdeer Technologies as an investment is the roadmap to build a vertically integrated and self-sustaining ecosystem with profitable growth over the long run. Final Thoughts 2025 will be a critical year for Bitdeer to confirm the viability of its business model. The wild card in the equation is where Bitcoin evolves going forward. A scenario for the price of BTC to rapidly climb above $100k would be clearly positive by translating into higher cash flow for the existing operation and adding to the earnings potential as the capacity ramps up. While we've been bullish on BTC, the key risk to consider is the possibility of renewed volatility in the market that would translate into a less attractive market opportunity at lower prices. Any setback in the commercialization timetable for SEALMINER could also spark a large selloff in Bitdeer stock. From our ""strong buy"" recommendation last year, our call today is that Bitdeer is now more speculative with a different set of uncertainties. We rate the stock as a hold, implying a neutral view on the stock price over the near term, but leaving the door open to make a new assessment with updated data over the next few quarters. Ultimately, we believe there are better opportunities in the market elsewhere right now.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4738783-bitdeer-technologies-managing-the-new-economics-of-bitcoin-mining-rating-downgrade?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36578302.jpeg

36577093,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653950,1732047205,"Bitcoin Reaches New High Of $94,000: Blockstream CEO Anticipates $1 Million Ahead","Bitcoin (BTC) has achieved a historic milestone, reaching $94,000 for the first time, fueled by a significant uptrend since November 5, the day President-elect Donald Trump secured his re-election. Trump’s promise to bring regulatory clarity to digital assets has ignited a strong rally, with BTC recording a 40% increase in just two weeks. ‘Prepare For Possible Seven-Figure BTC Prices’ This surge reflects increased buying pressure and correlates with growing inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Yet, speculation surrounding a potential US Bitcoin strategic reserve has further bolstered investor confidence. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Could Soon Rally Past $250—Are Bulls in Control? Blockstream CEO Adam Back, a long-time advocate for Bitcoin, has suggested that if the US were to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve, investors should prepare for the possibility of seven-figure Bitcoin prices in this market cycle. Back stated: if the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve happens prepare for 7 figure Bitcoin. this cycle. the market is skeptical on meaningful follow through for now, so that is not at all priced in. Market expert Anthony Pompliano highlighted that discussions around this initiative are intensifying as pro-crypto Senator Cynthia Lummis has introduced legislation to put the reserve into action, while Trump has previously committed to utilizing the approximately 200,000 BTC already held by the US government. Bitcoin To $150,000 In 2025? Despite these proposals, Pompliano argues that they do not go far enough. He advocates for a more aggressive approach, suggesting that the US should print $250 billion on the first day of Trump’s presidency and invest the entire amount into Bitcoin. Pompliano outlines that the proposed $250 billion investment could purchase nearly 2.8 million BTC at the current price. However, recognizing that the US government’s purchases would likely influence market prices, he estimates the average purchase price could rise to $150,000 per coin, resulting in the acquisition of approximately 1.6 million BTC. Related Reading: Solana Analyst Expects A Retrace Before It Breaks ATH – Targets Revealed Combined with the 200,000 Bitcoin already held, this would position the US as the largest holder of Bitcoin globally, with a total of 1.8 million BTC. Pompliano asserts that this strategy, while seemingly costly, would represent a prudent financial move with the potential for significant long-term benefits.

Price action remains robust, leaving investors waiting for lower prices frustrated, as BTC shows no signs of providing an easy entry point anytime soon. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaking Out Of Falling Wedge Pattern – Analyst Reveals Target Key data from CryptoQuant reveals that long-term holders (LTHs) are currently in an active distribution phase, signaling increased selling activity from this group. Despite this, the market has absorbed the additional supply without significant price impact, highlighting the strong demand supporting BTC at these levels. As Bitcoin consolidates just below its all-time highs, traders and analysts are closely watching whether the current momentum will lead to a breakout or if a retracement is on the horizon. The balance between rising demand and LTH distribution will likely determine BTC’s near-term trajectory. Can Bitcoin Set New ATH This Week? Bitcoin is on the brink of breaking its all-time high (ATH) again this week, sitting just 2% below the $93,483 level set last Wednesday. Excitement is building as analysts and investors closely watch BTC’s price action, anticipating whether it will surge past this critical level or enter a prolonged consolidation phase. While the bullish momentum remains strong, the possibility of a sideways movement could keep the price range-bound for an extended period before the next significant move. Data from CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler highlights that long-term holders (LTHs) are currently in an active distribution phase. Despite this, the increased supply has not significantly impacted Bitcoin’s price, thanks to strong demand that continues to absorb selling pressure. This dynamic reflects the robust market interest that is supporting BTC near its record highs. Adler’s analysis also points to the LTH Spending Binary Indicator, which signals peak spending activity among LTHs. At the same time, the growing LTH supply suggests that a portion of long-term holders remain confident in BTC’s future price potential. These factors create a unique environment where high demand offsets distribution, keeping the bullish momentum intact. Related Reading: Last Chance To Buy Ethereum? Analyst Expects $6,000 Once It Breaks 8-Month Accumulation As Bitcoin flirts with its ATH, market participants await confirmation of whether the price will push into uncharted territory or pause for consolidation. The outcome will likely set the tone for BTC’s trajectory in the coming weeks, with investors betting on the continued upside in this resilient rally. BTC Price Action: Key Levels To Hold Bitcoin is trading at $91,820, following several days of sideways consolidation just below its all-time high (ATH). Despite the pause, BTC has maintained its position above the $87,000 support level since the last breakout, signaling its importance as a crucial line for bulls to defend. Holding this level is vital for sustaining upward momentum and setting the stage for Bitcoin to push into uncharted territory. However, a drop below $87,000 could shift market sentiment, likely triggering a correction as BTC searches for fresh demand. The next logical support zone lies around the $80,000 mark, with the potential for a deeper pullback if selling pressure intensifies. Such a retrace would provide an opportunity for sidelined buyers but could temporarily stall BTC’s rally. Bitcoin’s price action remains robust, bolstered by demand that continues to outpace supply. This strong market interest has mitigated the impact of profit-taking and selling activity, keeping the broader uptrend intact. Related Reading: Solana Breaks Above Key Resistance At $225 – ATH Next? As BTC consolidates near its ATH, traders closely watch key levels to determine whether the next move will be a breakout to new highs or a dip to test lower support zones. Either outcome will likely shape Bitcoin’s trajectory in the coming weeks.

42435306,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kotkY,1732044431,Ethena Sees $1B Inflows as Crypto Rally Brings Back Double-Digit Yields,"Ethena's USDe yield-bearing token grew by $1 billion in a month to $3.44 billion as perpetual funding rates rose amid the crypto rally.  The token now offers a 29% annualized yield, rebounding from a period of below the U.S. dollar risk-free rate as crypto markets corrected.  DeFi lenders and exchanges listing USDe as collateral assets and plans to distribute protocol revenues to governance token holders could further bolster growth.  As crypto markets rocketed higher since Trump's election victory, Ethena's yield-bearing token is back in vogue with investors.  The project's USDe token attracted around $1 billion in new capital over the past month, climbing to a market capitalization of $3.44 billion, according to DefiLlama data. Now, it's only 5% below its record value of $3.6 billion in July.  Ethena faced headwinds as crypto markets cooled off from their March peak. USDe is marketed as a ""synthetic dollar"" with its price anchored at $1. It uses bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}} as backing assets, pairing them with an equal value of short perpetual futures positions on multiple exchanges. The strategy generates revenue on its backing derivative assets when the perpetual funding rates are positive and passes on some of the income as yield to investors.  Perpetual funding rates turned negative in August and September, rendering Ethena's strategy unfavorable to investors with yields lower than the risk-free rate for the U.S. dollar. Investors withdrew $1.2 billion from the protocol between July and October.  Now, as crypto markets turn red-hot, with BTC breaking multiple all-time records, Ethena offers a 29% annualized yield to holders who stake their tokens, according to the project's website.  More catalysts for Ethena growth  There are more catalysts ahead that could fuel further growth.  Decentralized lending behemoth Aave added staked USDe token among its available collateral assets, allowing users to borrow against the tokens while earning a yield.  ""Expect that the Aave integration [...] will be a multi-billion supply sink for USDe within the next month, and two new CEX collateral listings are dropping within the next week,"" Guy Young, Ethena's co-founder and CEO, said in an X post on Friday.  Ethena also plans to start sharing protocol revenues with governance token (ENA) holders, after the project's risk committee approved a governance initiative last week. The plan was proposed by crypto trading firm Wintermute on Nov. 6, following Donald Trump's election victory. Industry players anticipate more appeasing regulations for decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols under a Trump presidency, as the president-elect also backs one.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/19/ethena-sees-1b-inflows-as-crypto-rally-brings-back-double-digit-yields,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f57f852e9bc3364e44766c63e2afb6be4de3d3c9-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Here’s The Full Story,"The Sui Network’s SUI crypto is making big moves in the market, hitting an impressive all-time high (ATH) of $3.92 this November. The current price of $3.76 shows the token is still climbing. Many are asking if SUI can break the $4 level and even reach $10 soon.This article looks at the reasons behind the sui price surge, important updates about the network, and what technical data says about the future. Breaking Down SUI’s Fast GrowthSUI has grown by an unbelievable 930% from its all-time low, making it one of the fastest-growing tokens right now. Its 10-day moving average is $3.48, showing strong short-term growth, while the 50-day moving average of $2.30 proves steady growth over time. The RSI is currently 80.36, which suggests that the token might be overbought. Even so, the positive mood in the bigger market keeps driving prices higher. These numbers make it clear that SUI is gaining a lot of positive attention, even more than before . SUI Price 19NOV24 SUI Price 19NOV24 In November alone, SUI's price jumped by 90%, outpacing many other cryptocurrencies.

It is the main token for the Sui Network, a blockchain designed to handle transactions quickly and efficiently. This makes it a good platform for building decentralized applications (dApps). Its technology and ease of use are pulling in more users and developers, helping the ecosystem grow fast. This success has added to the rising sui price.The token's price surge isn’t just because of hype. On-chain data proves there is real growth in demand.

Spot bitcoin ETF options are now live on Nasdaq.  The product was rolled out in strong demand from traders.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} made new highs on Tuesday as Wall Street rolled out its latest product, almost guaranteed to increase the exposure of the digital currency among financial institutions: options trading on spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).  At press time, the top crypto was trading above $94,000, up more than 4% in the last 24 hours. This breaks its previous record of $93,450, set on Nov. 13.  Meanwhile, the CoinDesk 20 — an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization except for stablecoins, memecoins, and exchange tokens — is up about 0.3%. The index’s biggest winner was {{HBAR}}, up 9%, while the biggest loser was {{POL}}, down 0.8%.  Options contracts allow investors to buy or sell an asset at a specific price and at a pre-determined time. While the CME already offered bitcoin options, the spot bitcoin ETF options are a big deal for retail participants and financial institutions alike, according to Noelle Acheson, former head of market insights at Genesis.  “A deeper onshore derivatives market will enhance the growing market sophistication,” Acheson posted on X. “This will reinforce investor confidence in the asset, bringing in new cohorts while enabling a greater variety of investment and trading strategies.”  “Institutions will be attracted to the greater flexibility and access to high-volume exposure,"" Acheson added. ""Options offer deeper granularity in expressing an investment opinion, and can boost exposure relative to outlay, making them especially attractive to large players.”  Only one of the eleven U.S.-based spot bitcoin ETFs — BlackRock’s IBIT — currently has options available so far, and the demand has been strong.  “A few hundred million so far in options volume on IBIT (a ton for day one),” Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas posted on X.

The token, which has regained attention from both casual investors and traders, might be preparing to revisit its all-time high (ATH) of $0.73, a level tied to an ambitious $100 billion market cap. Related Reading: XRP Mania On The Rise: ATH Predictions Backed By Solid Google Search Interest Cryptocurrency specialist Master Kenobi is of the opinion that this particular milestone can give a psychological edge not only to the holders of Dogecoin but also to the whole cryptocurrency community at large. Dogecoin may use this valuation as an advertising of sorts, reviving interest and attracting new investors to the ecosystem. It is yet unclear if DOGE will be able to overcome its past propensity for short-term consolidation and steer toward a more gradual ascent this time. ✨ #DOGE quick UPDATE: Have you ever wondered what the #Dogecoin chart would look like when scaled to the previous cycle? If the price starts moving toward a new level now, the first stop would likely be the ATH, a zone that coincides with a market cap of approximately $100B.… https://t.co/uuRPgGjcuw pic.twitter.com/IlG0e80ZZ2 — Master Kenobi (@btc_MasterPlan) November 17, 2024 Is It A Surge Or Stagnation? Two different possibilities are emerging, according to analysts, as DOGE moves closer to these critical zones. According to the first scenario, there may be a low-volatility phase of stasis followed by an explosive breakout. Before a retreat happens, a surge like this might drive DOGE’s price toward the desired $1 level or perhaps higher, aiming for a range of $1.2 to $1.3. The second scenario suggests a quicker rise fueled by strong momentum, breaking through resistance levels without a prolonged pause. For now, the 43.14% price volatility recorded in the past 30 days serves as a reminder of Dogecoin’s unpredictable nature, even during bullish cycles. A Bullish Market With Cautionary Notes The picture painted by market indicators is conflicting but generally positive. Dogecoin has shown resiliency and investor trust by achieving green days on 63% of the previous month. The Fear & Greed Index, which states a reading of 90, indicates growing enthusiasm. However, CoinCodex has already predicted a possible decline in price by 7.63% by December. This prognosis emphasizes the need for caution rather than undermining the current bullish mood. While long-term holders should balance the risks of volatility against the possibility of significant rewards, short-term traders may discover opportunities during times of consolidation or declines.

Analyst Calls For A 200% Spike A Crucial Moment For DOGE The success of Dogecoin in navigating significant resistance levels and sustaining market interest will determine if it retests its ATH.

42435311,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kotlS,1732039497,Dueling 'Eliza' AI Tokens Boom and Zoom in Frenzied Trading,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) might one day be humanity's downfall, but in the meantime, humans are doing a pretty good job marketing it for their profit.  The creators of crypto's latest AI darling project, ""ai16z"" (a cheeky riff on the prolific venture fund Andreessen Horowitz), found that out the hard way this week. They planned to reveal a brand-new token associated with their AI creation, called ELIZA. Instead, they were front-run by someone else doing it first.  A chart-flipping crypto-trader brawl erupted. Suddenly, there were two ELIZA coins: one created days ago by apparent fans of ai16z and another, brand-new coin endorsed by the creator of ai16z.  The old coin, which had grown to a market cap of $40 million, dropped to $6 million in 30 minutes of frenzied selling, while the new coin blasted from nothingness to a peak of $100 million.  Along the way, individual traders lost tens of thousands of dollars and more on a memecoin that had swiped its branding from a better-known project that had copied the branding of one of the world's best-known VCs.  ""We had a plan, and a story to tell, and we were faced with an impossible situation, frontrun on literally the mascot character of our own brand,"" ai16z's pseudonymous creator, who goes by Shaw, said on X.  That mascot character is Eliza, an open-source framework for AI characters that can interact with people on social media. On Tuesday, Shaw ""set her free"" and endorsed the new ELIZA token, whose sanctioned creators have pledged to give a valuable chunk to ai16z's treasury.  In public calls on X, Shaw defended the messy chain of events. He said the old Eliza token's early holders would receive 10% of the new token—a de facto bailout for being obliterated on their original investment.  Instead, Shaw insisted the new token was ""essential"" in creating an ELIZA-linked asset unshackled from ai16z's branding that could live beyond it, and become bigger, with its own stories and lore, and influence over a wave of AI characters.  Ai16z is attempting to position itself as a prominent entity in the AI wave. It bills itself as a venture fund completely managed by an AI agent with the goal of ""flipping a16z."" Holders of the project's token (which has a market cap north of $300 million) will be able to influence the project's AI chieftain, ""Marc AIndresseen,"" according to its website.  Eliza's new token is ""not an ai16z project,"" according to Shaw. Instead it's the creation of a different, unnamed ""partner"" that he said is working with the ai16z team.",NEGATIVE,없음,MARKET | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/19/dueling-eliza-ai-tokens-boom-and-zoom-in-frenzied-trading,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c13fbefb3e7b68764aacb77191160f86baf41e93-4961x2791.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The rally has caught the attention of traders and investors alike, as SOL’s price action showcases a strong uptrend. Top crypto analyst Johnny shared his technical analysis on X, predicting that Solana may retrace to its previous yearly highs before launching a new attempt to break its all-time highs. This forecast comes during a period of euphoria, with SOL delivering a stunning performance by soaring over 55% in less than two weeks. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaking Out Of Falling Wedge Pattern – Analyst Reveals Target The rapid climb has positioned Solana as one of the market’s standout assets, driven by increasing demand and strong fundamentals. However, Johnny’s outlook suggests a healthy pullback could be on the horizon, potentially offering a key buying opportunity before SOL challenges its historic price levels. With SOL’s recent performance reigniting optimism in the crypto space, all eyes remain on its ability to maintain strength in the face of potential volatility. Will Solana defy expectations and reach new heights, or is a cooldown inevitable? Solana Testing Critical Supply Level Solana is testing a critical supply level just below $250, following a significant surge that has propelled it closer to its all-time high (ATH). This level serves as a key battleground, marking the last stronghold for sellers before SOL enters price discovery—a phase where it could carve out new highs. Crypto analyst Johnny recently shared his perspective on X, highlighting that while Solana’s price action remains robust, a temporary retrace to lower levels may be necessary to gather momentum. According to his technical analysis, SOL could dip into the $220 demand zone, a level he sees as crucial for buyers to step in and refuel the rally. Johnny predicts that Solana could stage a strong recovery from there, targeting an aggressive move above its ATH at $260. Solana’s bullish momentum cannot be ignored despite the possibility of a retrace. The asset’s price action suggests a 6% surge above its ATH is well within reach if market conditions remain favorable. Continued strength in the broader crypto market could amplify buying pressure, helping SOL shatter its ATH and enter uncharted territory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Demand Outpaces Supply – On-Chain Metrics Reveal Low Seller Volume For now, all eyes are on Solana’s ability to navigate this supply zone. A successful breakout could pave the way for new highs, while a retrace to $220 might provide an ideal launching pad for the next leg of its rally. Either way, SOL’s trajectory highlights its growing prominence in the market as traders anticipate its next big move. Price Action Details Solana is trading at $242, holding steady after a few days of consolidation below the $250 mark. This level represents a critical resistance as SOL inches closer to its all-time high (ATH). Despite this pause, the price action remains robust, supported by the broader bullish sentiment across the crypto market. However, SOL’s ability to break above $250 will be a key factor in determining its next move. A successful push beyond this level could set the stage for a retest of its ATH and potentially a rally into price discovery. Conversely, if SOL fails to overcome this resistance, a retrace to lower demand zones becomes likely. Related Reading: Last Chance To Buy Ethereum? Analyst Expects $6,000 Once It Breaks 8-Month Accumulation In this scenario, the next logical support level to watch would be around $222, where buyers could step in to reignite momentum. Should the retrace extend further, SOL might revisit previous yearly highs at $210, a critical level that proved significant for price action.

42435298,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kotbW,1732033158,AI Agents Can Help Crypto Become the Currency of AI,"Agentic artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly becoming one of the most significant paradigms in the new era of foundation models. By agentic, we refer to AI systems that can not only produce outputs but also execute actions in a given environment. Consider automation scenarios like responding to emails, interacting with a database, calling an API, or performing physical tasks in an embodied AI setting such as robotic tasks.  Unlike previous automation paradigms, agentic AI has the potential to enable agents to achieve semi- or full autonomy within their environments. We can envision a near future where tens of millions of semi-autonomous agents become integral to business and personal ecosystems. Crypto assets could serve as a fundamental representation of the world these AI agents interact with.  In other words, crypto holds the potential to become the currency of AI. But, while this notion is frequently promoted as a way to show the promise of crypto in powering a new intelligent economy, significant practical challenges lie ahead.  Many Demos, Few Products  To understand the potential of AI agents using crypto, it’s essential to assess the fragmented state of the current agent market. The promise of semi-autonomous agents has triggered an explosion of frameworks for building them, far surpassing market readiness. While most organizations recognize the potential of autonomous agents, they remain in the early stages of adoption. As a result, we see numerous agent demos but very few production-ready products.  This is significant because the intersection of crypto and autonomous agents relies heavily on the maturity of the latter market. In a world where millions of autonomous agents augment our business and personal tasks, crypto could enhance these capabilities. There are several hypotheses about this augmentation, ranging from coordination to monitoring. But the greatest opportunity lies in the financial domain.  If we think of autonomous agents as extensions of our business and professional workflows, then e-commerce will be a crucial component of interactions between humans and agents, as well as between agents themselves. And crypto represents the most promising opportunity to unlock this potential.  Economic Layer of the Intelligent Internet  Payments have been central to the evolution of the internet. PayPal unlocked many early e-commerce workflows, and platforms like Stripe have fully catalyzed this transformation. If AI agents become the fabric of the intelligent internet, financial transactions will be a key component of this new layer.  The programmability of crypto makes it an excellent fit for enabling payment capabilities in AI agents. But what scenarios make crypto ideal for agentic workflows while highlighting the limitations of fiat?  Imagine a situation where an agent engages another agent to complete a specific task such as paying invoices and following up with clients via emails. In this scenario, agents might receive numerous of those tasks, with payments unlocked as these tasks are completed( ex: an invoice is successfully paid).  The nascent state of the AI agent market is a challenge to making any of these scenarios work in practice. Therefore, the evolution of payment transactions in agentic workflows will likely not follow a straightforward path to crypto adoption and may undergo several iterations.  Crypto-AI Culture Clash  One often-overlooked obstacle to the adoption of crypto in multi-agent architectures is the cultural mismatch between the AI and crypto communities. Most teams driving innovation in agentic platforms have little to no connection to the crypto market, are not enthusiastic about Web3, and perceive crypto as a friction point for platform adoption beyond the crypto industry. This cultural disconnect extends to investors as well.  Many leading AI agent platforms were funded during one of the most challenging bear markets in the crypto space, a period when venture capitalists were particularly skeptical of crypto's value. Additionally, organizations adopting AI agent platforms may still view crypto as a barrier to adoption within their operations.  While high-quality AI teams are emerging in the Web3 and AI agent space, this cultural friction should not be underestimated. Overcoming these challenges will require unlocking use cases that are impossible without crypto payments.  Lack of Agent E-Commerce  In the crypto world, the idea of AI agents conducting financial transactions is often discussed as an inevitability. While the promise is clear, the required infrastructure is lacking. Companies like Stripe built their businesses on decades of e-commerce innovation, supported by extensive merchant networks. This infrastructure does not yet exist for AI agents. As a result, early use cases for agents transacting may resemble the internet of the 1990s and will need significant evolution.  Let’s explore ideas for AI agent transactions using a hypothetical but plausible scenario. Imagine a group of agents across different geographies assigned 1,000 tasks, with payments unlocked upon completion of each one. To complete these tasks, some agents may need to collaborate with others. While some agents complete their tasks quickly and efficiently, others fail to deliver on time or effectively, leading to varying levels of conflict.  We have three options in today’s market:  1. Programmable Fiat  Programmable fiat platforms like Stripe offer a low barrier to entry for enabling financial transactions in multi-agent systems. Stripe’s recent announcement of an agent toolkit, integrated with many top frameworks, underscores this potential. The wide distribution of programmable fiat platforms, their large developer communities, and seamless integration with banking rails make them an attractive starting point for agentic payments.  However, programmable fiat presents limitations, such as challenges with cross-border payments, lengthy dispute resolution processes, and the complexity of performance-based payment triggers, making it suboptimal for agentic workflows.  2. Stablecoins  Stablecoins represent a natural intersection between AI and Web3. They address some of fiat's limitations in agentic workflows, offering on-chain settlements, global availability, and enhanced programmability. In this scenario, agents could receive payments in stablecoins like USDC or USDT upon task completion.  However, stablecoins fall short in key areas. They are primarily payment tokens and lack functionality linked to agent performance. For example, in cases where agents fail to complete tasks, disputes must be resolved outside the stablecoin payment system.  3. A Native Agent Cryptocurrency and Payment Protocol  The true intersection of Web3 and agentic AI for financial transactions could emerge through new tokens and protocols tailored for this use case. These could extend stablecoin capabilities by integrating agent-specific functionalities.  In our scenario, payments could be made using a specialized asset that agents can stake for quality control. Slashing policies could penalize poor performance, while validators could resolve disputes based on task quality. Additionally, agents’ reputations could be directly tied to their token stakes. While this approach requires advancements in both Web3 and agentic AI, it is not as distant as it may seem.  Agents Are All We Need  Agentic AI has the potential to become one of the most fertile intersections between Web3 and AI. Semi-autonomous agents will become ubiquitous, requiring robust financial infrastructure for transactions. While programmable fiat may address initial needs, its limitations highlight crypto’s potential to shine.  Stablecoins offer a promising start, but they may not suffice in the long run. The rise of agentic AI is likely to drive the creation of custom tokens, wallets, protocols, and possibly blockchains optimized for agentic workflows. Agents could become the gateway for crypto to emerge as the true currency of AI.

36570946,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=101843,1732033019,Here’s How High Dogecoin Can Go if DOGE Repeats Its 2021 Rally,"Dogecoin (DOGE) might hit a new all-time high if it replicates the 2021 performance that saw it surge by 18,340% in five months. Dogecoin recently caught the attention of the broader crypto market following its tremendous rise above the $0.4 mark. Specifically, DOGE’s price spiked by 156% in one week, soaring from around $0.17 to $0.4359 between November 6 and 12.The massive surge strengthened investors’ confidence in DOGE, as they speculate that the asset might repeat its 2021 rally in this bull run. Dogecoin Price If It Repeats 2021 Rally For context, Dogecoin stunned investors in 2021, soaring from a modest $0.0040 to an all-time high (ATH) of $0.7376 on May 8. This represents a staggering increase of 18,340% within the first five months of 2021. Amid Dogecoin’s recent rally, many investors are wondering how much DOGE would be worth if it replicates its 2021 performance this cycle. Achieving a similar growth rate of 18,340% before the end of this cycle would see the price of DOGE surge to an unprecedented level. If Dogecoin is able to surge similarly to 2021 and repeat a potential surge of 18,340% from the current level, it will take its price to a whopping $69.03, marking a new ATH record for DOGE. This would positively impact Dogecoin’s market cap, boosting it to $10.12 trillion from the current $54.88 billion, potentially making DOGE the most valuable cryptocurrency in the world. At a price of $69.03, a portfolio of 14,486.5 DOGE, currently worth about $5,424, would be valued at $1 million. Key Factors to Consider While it remains uncertain whether Dogecoin will experience a surge of 18,340% as it did in 2021, it is important to note that three major factors contributed to DOGE’s jaw-dropping rally three years ago. Elon Musk Effect At the top of the list is the Elon Musk effect. Musk played a significant role in Dogecoin’s 2021 rise. His endorsement of the token on X paved the way for the 18,340% rally. Interestingly, Musk still has the capacity to drive Dogecoin’s price, as seen over the past week when DOGE surged by 156% due to his continuous mention of D.O.G.E (Department of Government Efficiency) on X. It is worth mentioning that U.S. President-Elect Donald Trump recently appointed Musk to head the new federal agency. Massive Retail Interest Elon Musk’s endorsement of Dogecoin in 2021 attracted the interest of retail investors, leading to an 18,340% rally. As Musk continues to mention the D.O.G.E agency on X, most retail investors would likely see it as an opportunity to acquire DOGE, potentially positioning the asset for a repeat of its 2021 rally. Bull Market Another factor that contributed to Dogecoin’s 18,340% rise in 2021 was the timing of the surge, which coincided with the 2021 bull market. At the time, several cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA), reached new ATHs. Notably, DOGE also benefited from the bull market, leading to its surge to an ATH. Currently, the market is in the second phase of the bull run, which is expected to linger till next year.",POSITIVE,ADA | DOGE,ADA | BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/19/heres-how-high-dogecoin-can-go-if-doge-repeats-its-2021-rally/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=heres-how-high-dogecoin-can-go-if-doge-repeats-its-2021-rally,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Trump was involved in two pro-crypto events on Monday as he continues to show his support for the nascent sector following his election victory. Notably, his firm recently acquired a crypto platform while he met with a key industry leader, sparking speculations of another pro-crypto cabinet member.Trump Media Acquires Bakkt ExchangeThe Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) is reportedly in advanced talks to acquire Bakkt, a trading exchange owned by Intercontinental Exchange. The Financial Times disclosed the contact between the two firms on Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.TMTG's supposed acquisition had a massive impact on Bakkt's shares, which soared over 160% on Monday. At the time of this report, BKKT is still enjoying a flourishing market outing, up 13% in the past 24 hours to trade at $33.56.Meanwhile, the deal came despite TMTG's lack of financial buoyancy. For context, Truth Media reported a net loss of $363 million in the third quarter and a revenue of just $2.6 million year-to-date.On the other hand, the Intercontinental Exchange-owned Bakkt records a total revenue of $328.4 million and an operating loss of $27.4 million. Notably, Bakkt shares the same parent company as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and has had its financial woes too.Meanwhile, reasons for the possible purchase remain undisclosed at press time. However, it is said to be related to Trump's recent crypto venture, the World Liberty Financial , but this remains unconfirmed.Trump in Discussion with Coinbase CEONotably, the acquisition news also followed reports that Trump met with Coinbase's CEO , Brian Armstrong. A report from the Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the development, confirmed the meeting, which was their first since the decisive November 5 election win.WSJ noted that the duo allegedly discussed matters related to administrative appointments. Notably, Trump has been busy with his cabinet appointments, with Elon Musk and Robert F. Kennedy filling roles in the new administration.Furthermore, Trump's proposal to set up a crypto presidential advisory council would be part of the president's discussions with Armstrong.

42435303,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kotgw,1732032222,"Howard Lutnick, Tether's Wall Street Banker, Is Trump's Pick for Commerce Chief, Not Treasury Secretary","U.S. President-elect Donald Trump wants Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick — a vocal cryptocurrency enthusiast who has been stablecoin giant Tether's (USDT) Wall Street banker for years — to serve as his Commerce Secretary, not Treasury Secretary.  Lutnick was one of many vying for the powerful Treasury Secretary role, but reports over the past few days suggested his stock had fallen in Trump's eyes. Tuesday's announcement that he would be nominated to the Commerce role instead supports that, despite Lutnick's role as part of Trump's transition team. Punchbowl News and The Wall Street Journal first reported his new designated position earlier Tuesday.  ""He will lead our tariff and trade agenda, with additional direct responsibility for the Office of the United States Trade Representative,"" Trump said in a statement.  Lutnick's firm, Cantor Fitzgerald, is a stalwart in finance, known particularly for its influential role in the bond market. That includes serving as a primary dealer, an exclusive group of firms allowed to trade directly with the Federal Reserve. It has also dabbled in crypto. Since 2021, it has helped Tether manage the giant stockpile of U.S. Treasuries that back its USDT stablecoin. Cantor Fitzgerald also recently announced a bitcoin financing business — aimed at providing leverage to bitcoin investors — with $2 billion of initial funding.  ""I am a fan of crypto, but let me be very specific: bitcoin, just bitcoin. These other coins, they are just not a thing,"" he told CNBC in a podcast last year, adding: ""I'm a big fan of this stablecoin called tether.""  Lutnick has argued bitcoin should be treated as a commodity — meaning it would face less regulation than, say, stocks or bonds — and is superior to other cryptocurrencies given its lack of central authority and censorship-resistant properties.  The 63-year-old is a long-time friend of Trump, a fellow New Yorker. Lutnick is already co-chair of the Trump transition team.  Cantor Fitzgerald's history is marred by tragedy: 658 of its employees were killed on 9/11, almost one-third of its global team. Because it lost so many workers, the company was forced to embrace electronic trading instead of how things conventionally worked in the Treasury market: human brokers calling or visiting clients. Today, Wall Street is embracing crypto and blockchains as a way to disrupt old ways of doing business and keeping records.

Bitcoin surged near $94,000 last Wednesday, marking a historic peak for the leading crypto. This milestone fueled speculation about a potential short-term pause in its rally, with market watchers closely monitoring its next move toward the $100,000 mark. However, the days following this high were marked by volatility as Bitcoin repeatedly dipped below $87,000. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has stabilized above $90,000. Analysts believe the bull run is still ongoing, with crypto trading slightly around $92,000 at press time. Euphoria Signals a Critical PhaseAs noted by Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, the recent rally coincided with heightened euphoria. According to Young Ju's data, 99.3% of Bitcoin’s Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) are currently in profit, a metric historically associated with euphoric bull market phases. These levels often align with major price rallies, including previous 2013, 2017, and 2021 peaks. His analysis suggests that such euphoric phases can last three to twelve months, barring anomalies like the November 2021 bull trap. However, according to the CryptoQuant CEO, the current euphoric phase began two weeks ago. He suggested that shorting Bitcoin now could be a risky endeavor—either trying to catch the top of the market or betting against the rally at the bottom of a parabolic bull run.https://twitter.com/ki_young_ju/status/1858787640864371144 Liquidation Levels and Halving PatternsFurther analysis by Daan Crypto Trades highlighted liquidation clusters around the $93,000 mark, indicating significant market activity near the all-time high. His Binance BTC/USDT Liquidation Map suggests that prolonged consolidation at this level could trigger further price surges as traders' positions build up. Concurrently, Aurelien Ohayon underscored the role of Bitcoin’s halving cycles in driving bull markets.

This steady performance reflects underlying bullish momentum, as buyers continue to defend this key zone, boosting confidence in the asset’s upward potential. With strong support intact, SUI appears well-positioned to target higher resistance levels, sparking optimism for further gains. This analysis aims to explore SUI’s ability to stay above the $3.5 level and assess its implications for future price movements. By examining key technical indicators and resistance zones, this piece seeks to provide insights into whether SUI can sustain its bullish strength or if market pressures could trigger a shift in its trajectory. What SUI Stability Above $3.5 Means For Bulls SUI is showcasing renewed bullish strength as it maintains a firm position above the critical $3.5 support level. This stability highlights growing buying interest and market confidence, paving the way for a possible move toward the $4 mark. Its ability to hold above this key level and the 4-hour Simple Moving Average (SMA) reinforces the asset’s upward momentum, and positions SUI for further gains if positive sentiment persists. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) analysis shows a rebound from 51%, rising toward and above the 60% level, indicating a renewed optimistic outlook. If the RSI continues to rise above 60%, it would confirm the positive trend, boosting the potential for more price growth. Related Reading: SUI Eyes Potential Breakout Amid Market Retrace, Is $2.3 Next? Additionally, SUI shows significant upward movement on the daily chart, marked by the formation of a bullish candlestick as it moves toward the $4 mark. Trading above the crucial 100-day SMA reinforces the positive trend, indicating sustained strength. As SUI continues to climb, it bolsters market confidence, setting the stage for growth. With upside pressure brewing, the next key target to watch out for is the $4 resistance level, which could determine whether the bullish move extends. The daily chart’s RSI has increased to 80%, signaling strong positive sentiment with sustained buying pressure. While the asset remains in an overbought territory, it shows no signs of weakening. If the momentum continues, further price gains are possible, though one should be cautious, as prolonged overbought conditions could lead to a correction if buying pressure decreases. Potential Scenarios: Upside Targets And Risks To Watch SUI’s current stability above the $3.5 support level indicates potential for continued upside. Should buying pressure persist, the next key target lies at $4, where bullish interest could be triggered, leading to new price highs. Related Reading: Can SUI Reach $2.18? Bullish Pressure Builds Toward Key Milestone However, if resistance at $4 proves challenging to break through, consolidation or a minor decline may occur, possibly causing the price to retreat toward the $3.5 support level.

The development provides Wall Street investors with leveraged exposure to the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap. OCC Confirms BlackRock Options Listing Nasdaq’s listing of IBIT options comes several hours after the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) provided an update for the new listing. Last month, the U.S. SEC approved the 11 Bitcoin ETFs, including BlackRock’s IBIT, for options trading. Yesterday, the OCC released a memo confirming its readiness for the clearance and settlement of the product, beginning with IBIT. Furthermore, Allison Hennessey, Nasdaq’s head of ETP listings, informed Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas of the exchange’s plans to list and trade IBIT options today, on November 19. Hours after the announcement, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF options launched on Nasdaq, giving investors the right to trade IBIT shares at a specified price. Significance of Bitcoin ETF Options The move is expected to significantly impact Bitcoin, boosting the asset’s institutional adoption and price outlook.Moreover, Joe Consorti, head of growth at Theya, asserted that the Bitcoin ETF options mark a key development in the derivatives markets, noting that financial derivatives for traditional assets often surpass the size of the underlying market cap by 10-20x. Consorti shared this view in a video making the rounds on X today.

However, due to regulatory issues, U.S. investors are prohibited from using this platform. With IBIT options going live on Nasdaq, Consorti believes the move could potentially integrate Bitcoin into the global capital market, enhancing market maturity and unlocking vast liquidity.Spot Bitcoin ETFs have made massive progress since their debut in January 2024.

Marathon's third-quarter report shows significant progress in mining capacity and lower computing costs, enhancing its competitive position and margins. Despite shareholder dilution to fund Bitcoin purchases, Marathon maintains a clean balance sheet with manageable long-term liabilities. Marathon's valuation is attractive relative to Bitcoin and its historical metrics, making it a compelling buy for patient investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin mining. Bitcoin miners have been through an unbelievably wild ride since the presidential election in the US, with many exploding higher only to see those gains quickly reversed. That’s been the case with Marathon Holdings (MARA), moving from $16 to $26 in the span of a few days, and finishing Monday’s session back at $18. The last time I covered the stock was back in June, and at the time, I was cautiously bullish. Shares have spiked and plummeted countless times since then, with it down about 11% from the price at the time of publication. Given the volatility of this stock, 11% over the course of five months isn’t much, but it’s down from my price in all fairness. The thing is, the allocation of capital in the Bitcoin-related stock space has gotten to the point where Marathon just looks cheap as it accumulates more and more Bitcoin. The stock will undoubtedly continue to be extremely volatile, but if you’re interested in owning a miner, I still think Marathon is worth a look. Choppiness galore I don’t particularly like charts that are super choppy, simply because they’re hard to trade. Seemingly random fluctuations in price are difficult to predict, which is why trends are better to follow, in my opinion. Marathon is the exact opposite of a trend. StockCharts Moving averages haven’t worked, and neither have support and resistance levels, for the most part. However, I think there are fundamental reasons for considering the Marathon, which I’ll detail below. Before we get to that, I will note the momentum indicators are showing that the bulls have a chance here to produce a bounce. The PPO is well into bullish territory, and the RSI is now testing 40 again, a place where it’s bounced significantly the past four times it’s been reached. We’ll see if that happens again, but given the way the momentum indicators look, and the fact that shares are down ~$8 in less than a week, I’d wager the odds of a bounce are higher than significant further selling. We shall see. This article, however, is not about the price chart, so let’s dig into the fundamentals for why I still think Marathon is worth a look on the long side. A quick review of the third quarter Marathon reported third quarter earnings a week ago, and it showed further progress in terms of building mining capacity, on an absolute but also relative basis. On that front, so far, so good. Investor presentation The company’s hashrate ended the quarter at 36.9 EH/s, nearly double what it was a year ago. It was over 40 at the end of October, and is expected to be ~50 by the end of December, per management's guidance. Of course, the halving made producing Bitcoin doubly as challenging, so there wasn’t a doubling of blocks produced in Q3. Still, Marathon is better off than it was a year ago on an absolute basis, and relatively. Available miner rewards were 4.8% in this year’s Q3 for Marathon, up sharply from 3.7% a year ago. In addition to boosting capacity quickly, Marathon is doing so at lower costs. Investor presentation It’s computing costs continue to decline, with significant progress in the past two quarters. So long as the company continues to build scale, we should see computing costs continue to decline, with higher margins the result. On this basis, I still like the fundamental picture here. We have a miner that is rapidly scaling, taking share from competitors, and doing so with lower costs. Apart from just mining, Marathon is attempting to be a leveraged Bitcoin play similar to MicroStrategy (MSTR), which was the OG Bitcoin Holder and shareholders have been rewarded over and over again. More on that below. Marathon now holds almost 27k Bitcoin, mining 2,070 during Q3 and buying three times that number for an average of $59.5k. In total, the company owns 20,266 Bitcoin it has mined for $42.8k each, and 6,481 coins it has purchased for an average of $60k each. That makes the company’s stash worth ~$2.5 billion against its market cap of $6.8 billion, or 2.7X its Bitcoin holdings. MicroStrategy owns 331k Bitcoin , worth about $30 billion, and has a market cap of $78 billion, or 2.6X its Bitcoin. There are obvious differences between the two, including the fact that Marathon is mining while MicroStrategy isn’t, and the latter employs enormous amounts of debt to fund its Bitcoin. It’s a leveraged Bitcoin fund at this point, with its software business absolutely meaningless in the context of $30 billion in Bitcoin holdings. Both models have their places, and I’m not comparing them directly, as they are quite different. But for some valuation context, it helps to understand how the chosen darling of Bitcoin stocks - MicroStrategy - is valued. Back to Marathon, one thing I’ve liked about the company’s operations is that it is not employing a huge amount of debt to finance operations. However, it continues to dilute shareholders. TIKR Common shares have exploded higher to 322M as of the end of the quarter, with further issuances used to buy Bitcoin. This strategy is fine as long as the shares issued are sufficiently cheap to make it a good use of capital. As long as Bitcoin goes higher, it’s hard to argue with, but dilution on this scale is something you must understand if you’re going to own the stock. Investor presentation The company’s balance sheet is clean with these share issuances, with long-term liabilities at just $665 million, which is quite manageable. Shareholder equity nearly tripled YoY, so again, it’s hard to argue with the strategy. Just know you’re likely to be diluted significantly over time, so the company can fund its Bitcoin purchases. Is it cheap enough? That’s the real question here, as Bitcoin is at an all-time high while Marathon shares are nowhere close. So what gives? Well, the valuation has plummeted by any measure, which means that if you were looking to get into Marathon, it’s difficult to see a better time to do so. Let’s start with price-to-tangible book value. Keep in mind, this is tangible book value, meaning it excludes things like goodwill; this is actual cash value of assets and liabilities. TIKR We’re at 2X TBV today, a ~40% discount to its three-year average, and a ~65% discount to the 2024 high valuation. Is that cheap enough? It certainly looks favorable to me from a risk/reward perspective, but you’ll have to be the judge for yourself. The final thing we’ll look at is Marathon’s price relative to Bitcoin itself, as it follows that if you’re a big holder of Bitcoin, your stock should move in tandem with the OG alt-currency. Below, I’ve plotted Bitcoin itself, along with the two lower panels showing Marathon’s share price against Bitcoin’s, and MicroStrategy’s price against Bitcoin for reference. StockCharts Since 2024 started, Marathon’s valuation relative to Bitcoin has fallen 66% . That means that the stock is 66% cheaper against its Bitcoin holdings than it was 11 months ago. MicroStrategy, by contrast, has seen is relative valuation nearly triple . This chart, perhaps better than any other, shows how capital is flowing in this sector. MicroStrategy is accumulating capital at an astonishing rate, with investors seemingly ignoring this explosion in valuation. The thesis here is that miners may start to attract some of that capital if/when the move in MicroStrategy cools. That stock is parabolic at this point, so capital will flow out at some point, and I think miners like Marathon will be beneficiaries. The bottom line here is that Marathon requires some patience here, but if you were looking to own a miner, it looks like a good choice today. The company’s capacity is ramping rapidly, it’s doing so with lower costs, and it owns a huge number of Bitcoin.

This prompted a series of back-and-forth comments. Kusama quipped that Litecoin was beneath Shiba Inu, stressing that he cannot hear the project from “down there.” This comment referenced the market cap rankings where Shiba Inu holds the 11th spot at $14.7 billion, while Litecoin ranks 22nd at $6.4 billion.Litecoin’s intern kept the banter going, responding with equally witty comments, including a jab about excessive protein intake.

36567893,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=102012,1732027801,Dogecoin to $1: Analyst Says Doge Breaking Out Again After Cool-Off with Projected 120% Rally,"Dogecoin is breaking out after a brief cool-off, with analysts predicting a 120% rally toward $1 as it forms a bullish pattern. Over the past few days, Dogecoin has struggled to regain its footing after briefly touching $0.4359 a week ago. The meme coin king has oscillated mostly within a tight range between $0.3500 and $0.3800, showing weak price action after its speculative bull run lost steam.However, Dogecoin showed promising signs of a comeback today, following a 10% green candle that pushed it back into the $0.4000 range. For context, since November 14, when Dogecoin dropped below the $0.40 mark, it had not regained that threshold until today. At press time, DOGE is trading at $0.3950 after a brief pullback.Dogecoin Ready for a 120% SurgeAmid this recent bullish signal, market watcher Ali Martinez has suggested that the meme coin could continue today’s rally and surge further by 120%. Martinez pointed out that Dogecoin is breaking out of a bull flag pattern, suggesting a potential 120% rally to $0.82, provided the $0.37 support level holds.The four-hour chart shared by the analyst shows that Dogecoin underwent a seven-day price consolidation since reaching the multi-year high of $0.4359. Now, it appears to be breaking out of this range-bound pattern. Martinez believes the meme coin could hit a new peak at $0.82 based on the recent price action, setting the path for $1. Other prominent market watchers, like “Professor Astrones,” have expressed similar bullish outlooks about Dogecoin’s breakout from consolidation. “It’s starting,” he tweeted , sharing a two-hour chart showing DOGE reversing the previous ranging trend.Resistance Levels Dogecoin Must OvercomeHowever, Dogecoin has significant resistance as it works toward a new peak. The immediate hurdle is overcoming the $0.4402 level, which aligns with the Fibonacci 1.0 level at which Dogecoin encountered rejection last week.Once this level is cleared, Dogecoin will face additional resistance at $0.5500 and $0.6500 before it can challenge its all-time high in the $0.70 range, which nearly coincides with the 1.618 Fibonacci level.While the path ahead presents challenges for Dogecoin, it’s worth mentioning that DOGE cleared previous resistance at the $0.2200 and $0.3000 levels in under 48 hours during its explosive price run between November 10 and 12, when it rose from $0.2173 to $0.4359.Higher Outlooks for DOGEMeanwhile, the crypto community eagerly anticipates an eventual Dogecoin rally to the $1 mark, much like they await Bitcoin's rise to $100K. Analysts have projected potential cycle peaks for Dogecoin as high as $18 and even $23, should it follow a similar performance to the last cycle. However, these targets remain highly speculative.",POSITIVE,DOGE,BTC | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/19/dogecoin-to-1-analyst-says-doge-breaking-out-again-after-cool-off-with-projected-120-rally/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=dogecoin-to-1-analyst-says-doge-breaking-out-again-after-cool-off-with-projected-120-rally,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

36564535,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653828,1732024848,Analyst Predicts Rapid Dogecoin Surge To $1: The Timing May Surprise You,"Crypto analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) is projecting a significant surge for the Dogecoin price, anticipating it to reach between $1 and $2 by the end of December or early January. This bullish forecast comes amid skepticism about the current breakout patterns observed in the memecoin. One Last Dip For Dogecoin Price Before $1? Over the past week, from November 12 to 19, Dogecoin formed a falling wedge—a pattern often considered bullish—on the lower timeframes. On November 19, the crypto asset broke out of this formation, prompting some optimism among traders. However, Kevin remains unconvinced about the strength of this move. “This weird little breakout on Dogecoin of this suspect bull flag looks very weak to me,” he stated via X. “Tracking the money flow on smaller time frames and smart investors are not convinced either. If money flow remains stagnant, then my base case of further correction/consolidation becomes more likely. Which, by the way, is more bullish if we just head straight up from here.” Related Reading: How Low Can Dogecoin Go Before Rallying Again? Expert Forecast When asked by an X user whether Dogecoin would surpass $0.40 by mid-December, Kevin responded confidently: “I think we’re at $1-$2 by end of December beginning of January.” Despite his bullish long-term outlook, Kevin still expects continued short-term correction for the Dogecoin price. He cautioned that “a lot of people will be wiped out if this occurs.” He elaborated on his price targets: “My first price target and a level we will want to hold for Dogecoin is the $0.30-$0.26 cent range, which is the golden pocket retrace levels. That’s a 30-40% correction from the local top, which in a bull market is a perfect size correction.” Over the long-term, Kevin foresees much higher price levels. In an analysis leveraging the Pi Cycle Tops Indicator—a tool traditionally applied to Bitcoin—crypto analyst Kevin recently shed light on Dogecoin’s long-term potential market trajectory. The indicator, crucial for pinpointing cycle highs and lows, relies on the crossing of two specific moving averages to signal significant market shifts. The shorter-term moving average (MA) which typically considers the last 111 days of price data. The longer-term MA which averages the last 350 days but multiplies it by two. The indicator’s principle is based on the theory that when these two MAs cross, a potential peak in the market price is imminent, suggesting a sell-off point before a downturn. It’s historically been used in Bitcoin analysis but, as Kevin demonstrates, it can also apply effectively to Dogecoin. Related Reading: Dogecoin Large Transactions Surge 41% With 35% Uptick In Daily Addresses, Will Price Follow? Kevin’s chart covers several years of the Dogecoin price action, clearly marking past cycle highs and lows where the Pi Cycle Indicator has been accurate. Past cycle highs are circled in the chart during January 2018 and May 2021, which coincide with the crossover of the two MAs and corresponding peaks in price. The current price movement shows a significant upward trajectory, and while the two MAs are converging, they have yet to cross. The chart plots a 1.618 Fibonacci extension level at around $4.00. Kevin writes: “One of my secret indicators for Dogecoin that is traditionally only supposed to work for #BTC is the Pi Cycle tops indicator. It has accurately called every DOGE cycle top and bottom over each of its cycles. When the two moving averages cross along with Monthly RSI being at a certain level that’s when I plan on taking significant portions out of the market. As you can see while the moving averages are now heading in the same direction to eventually cross we’re still not very close to crossing indicating we have a lot higher to go first.” At press time, DOGE traded at $0.38.

42435315,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kotqs,1732021398,First Mover Americas: Options Coming to Bitcoin ETFs Is a Big Deal,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 2,975.88 +1.3%  Bitcoin (BTC): $92,456.36 +2.06%  Ether (ETH): $3,144.77 +2.37%  S&P 500: 5,893.62 +0.39%  Gold: $2,636.70 +0.85%  Nikkei 225: 38,414.43 +0.51%  Top Stories  Bitcoin {{BTC}} is changing hands around $92,000, just 2% below record prices ahead of Tuesday's U.S. session. The largest crypto has advanced 2% over the past 24 hours, outperforming the 1.1% gain in the broad-market benchmark, the CoinDesk 20 Index. Native tokens of Chainlink {{LINK}}, Hedera {{HBAR}} and Uniswap {{UNI}} led gains among the biggest altcoins as traders expect broader institutional adoption and less regulatory headwinds for crypto from a Trump administration. Crypto hedge fund QCP anticipates BTC attempting a run to $100,000 in the coming months, with traders rotating those gains into altcoins. ""We won't be surprised to see altcoin season in full swing in the coming months,” QCP said. Still, there's a chance of a near-term blow-off top — a rapid drop following a rapid gain — as markets remain frothy, Augustine Fan, head of insights at SOFA, warned.  Bitcoin ETF options trading in the U.S. is expected to start today. Options on BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) ETF cleared the last regulatory hurdle on Monday, and they could bring more institutional appetite for the largest cryptocurrency. ""This marks a monumental shift,"" 10x Research said in a Tuesday newsletter. The products ""could attract significant trading volumes, potentially driving sharp price rallies in bitcoin,"" it said. For example, MicroStrategy (MSTR), the Nasdaq-listed company that owns the largest corporate BTC treasury in the world, is punching above its weight due to the booming market in its share options. MSTR options open interest surpasses the firm's market capitalization, while the stock's trading volume levels with Apple's and Microsoft's, companies with around a 40-times larger market value. A similar explosion in open interest and trading volume could happen with BTC, which could be accelerated due to bitcoin's supply limit, 10x Research noted.  Bitcoin mining economics improved in the first half of November, JPMorgan analysts said in a report. The hashprice, which measures miners' profitability, rose nearly 30% in the first two weeks of the month as the BTC price climbed to record highs. Rising profitability benefited the 14 U.S.-listed miners tracked by the bank, adding about $8 billion to their combined market capitalization. U.S.-based miners' share of the network hashrate remains at record highs, accounting for about 28% of the global network.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows daily active addresses on prominent blockchains.  Solana is well ahead of the pack, supporting the case for SOL outperformance ahead while Near Protocol is a distant second.

42435300,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kotf8,1732021200,"After Binance's $4.3B Lesson, Do Rival Crypto Exchanges Risk Running Afoul of U.S. Rules?","Cryptocurrency exchanges Bybit, Bitget and OKX had nearly a million ""monthly active users"" in the U.S. in August, data from Sensor Tower shows.  That doesn't mean these MAUs were trading in violation of U.S. rules; they could've just been engaging in allowed behavior like checking crypto prices.  But with VPNs, it's possible for Americans to circumvent geoblocks, a costly lesson exchange giant Binance recently learned.  At many crypto exchanges around the world, U.S. residents are like visitors to an art museum. They can look, but they're not supposed to touch.  Apparently, a lot of Americans are at least looking. Are any of them touching?  Bybit, Bitget and OKX, three of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, all prohibit traders from the U.S., where the companies are not licensed. Yet in August, the three exchanges combined had almost a million monthly active users (MAUs) in the U.S., according to research by Sensor Tower obtained by CoinDesk.  To be clear: ""active"" does not necessarily mean trading. If someone in the U.S. downloads the mobile app from Apple or Google and then does anything with it during a given month, they count as an MAU. Gawk at a price chart, as one might do on CoinDesk's price pages? That exchange would not be abetting rule-breaking behavior. It might be if the American trades, however.  Almost exactly a year ago, Binance, the world's top exchange, was forced to write a more than $4 billion check to the U.S. government to settle allegations that, in part, hinged on improperly allowing Americans to trade on its platform. Since then, the cryptocurrency industry has been on notice: Having customers in the United States can be a costly mistake.  Polymarket might be on a path to learning that, too, amid news that its CEO's home was raided last week — reportedly because people in the U.S., contrary to a 2022 deal with regulators, may have traded on the popular prediction market. (Though who knows if incoming President Donald Trump's Department of Justice will put its weight behind any investigation.)  Read more: Polymarket's Probe Highlights Challenges of Blocking U.S. Users (and Their VPNs)  Even though Bybit, Bitget and OKX warn website visitors with U.S. IP addresses that they are ineligible to trade, users can disguise their locations using virtual private networks, or VPNs. And even though all three exchanges erect another barrier to keep Americans out by requiring some level of customer identification, traders determined to get around such hurdles have been known to obtain fake, stolen or rented credentials.  Flashback to 2021: For $200, You Can Trade Crypto With a Fake ID  VPN and a fake ID  In jurisdictions with stringent cryptocurrency regulations, such as the United States, it is common for individuals to resort to VPNs to access offshore cryptocurrency exchanges, said Daniel Arroche, partner at French crypto law firm d&a partners.  “Although this practice often violates the terms of service of many platforms, it highlights the persistent demand for access to global markets despite regulatory hurdles,” Arroche said.  A spokesperson for Sensor Tower said it's impossible for his company to determine what exchange app users are doing.  “We can neither confirm nor deny if U.S. users are using VPNs to change their location to access trading,” the spokesperson said via email. (The research, which is paywalled, was shared with CoinDesk by a third party.)  A video shared with CoinDesk, whose creator requested it not be published with this story, shows how an American can easily circumvent Bybit’s geofencing.  The video shows a user first visiting whatismyip.com to display their U.S.-based IP address with the VPN disconnected. Next, they connect to a VPN and change their IP address to a country allowed by Bybit's terms of use. The user then opens the Bybit app, logs in and successfully completes know-your-customer checks using a non-U.S. ID belonging to someone else. After that, they add funds and trade crypto on the platform from the U.S. without any issues.  Americans can bypass geoblocking rules by purchasing someone else's know-your-customer (KYC) information for less than $50 worth of crypto. A series of screenshots shared with CoinDesk showed how a U.S. user provided their login credentials to someone they met on X (formerly Twitter). Shortly after, the U.S. user was verified and able to trade freely on the exchange using the identity of a Kenyan.  Read more:Crypto Airdrops Ban U.S. Users, but Americans Are Claiming Tokens Anyway  The crypto exchanges respond  Bybit, an exchange that has risen rapidly in the last year or so to become the second-largest behind Binance by some estimates, seems to host the largest contingent of MAUs in the U.S. — a jurisdiction the firm says is categorically excluded from its platform — with 451,800 such users in August, according to the Sensor Tower data.  The next largest in terms of numbers of U.S. MAUs was Bitget with 281,600, followed by OKX with 144,000, also recorded in August by Sensor Tower, a data provider cited on occasion by the likes of The Wall Street Journal, New York Times and Bloomberg.  A spokesperson for Bybit said the exchange has taken various measures, including KYC procedures and IP address bans, to ensure that its services and products are not available to people from restricted jurisdictions.  “Users who attempt to download the app or access the platform from restricted jurisdictions will not be able to complete the registration process unless the KYC documents they submitted have indicated otherwise. Additionally, Bybit has implemented IP restrictions to block access from those restricted jurisdictions,” the spokesperson said.  Bybit did not respond to follow-up questions about VPNs and rented IDs.  Bitget said it ""adheres to global compliance standards by enforcing region-based restrictions including the prohibited access of citizens of the US and various countries"" and that ""anyone attempting to access the Bitget app from any U.S. IP address will receive notifications indicating that access is restricted.""  As for the Sensor Tower data, Bitget said, “one possible explanation … is that users from other countries utilize methods such as VPNs to mask their locations and download crypto exchange apps through app stores. Sensor Tower only tracks the country from which the app was downloaded, without being able to further discern the users' actual nationality.”  OKX initially did not respond to requests for comment. After this article was published, a spokesperson said OKX's app can be used as a non-custodial wallet without trading on the exchange.  ""U.S. users can download the OKX app solely for the wallet,"" the spokesperson said. ""Those based in the U.S. have a legitimate reason to use the OKX Wallet for their own self-custody needs, similar to MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and other wallet apps.""

The uplift in the value of XRP has happened at a time when the rest of the cryptocurrency market anticipates some regulatory overhauls in the US, and more so after the results of the US elections. With over 90% gains within seven days, XRP’s price rally has brought back the excitement of investors towards the Ripple token. Related Reading: Poland Could Lead With Bitcoin Reserve, Presidential Hopeful Says Last Friday, the cryptocurrency closed at $1.05, a whopping 116% monthly increase. For comparison, XRP was barely moving at $0.50 a week ago. Although the altcoin appears to be making a rebound, Bitcoin’s recent spike above $93,000 probably contributed to an improvement in market mood overall. Google Trends Data Indicates Increasing Interest As XRP’s price has increased, so too has search interest. On Monday, Google Trends displays a peak popularity score of 100, a huge increase from just eight days earlier when it was only 8. This jump indicates a significant increase in public interest, which was probably spurred by XRP’s remarkable price movement and its return to the top market capitalization rankings. Remarkably, XRP has regained its position above Dogecoin with a market valuation of almost $65 billion. Cryptoes and other market observers have noted the historical significance of XRP’s most recent weekly closure. Nonetheless, some traders are wary, pointing out that the token may be overbought given the relative strength index (RSI) peaking above 93. #XRP Highest weekly close in 2 years | How high will it go? 🚀🌕 pic.twitter.com/BcoOWyt2Q1 — Cryptoes (@cryptoes_ta) November 18, 2024 Overcoming Resistance And Forecasts More than just pushing through the psychological barrier, the price rise of XRP also broke through long-standing resistance levels that had placed the price of this cryptocurrency below $1 for so long. Analysts say this might open a door for further long-term growth. If market sentiment and trading volume remain strong, the best forecasts hold it would experience another upswing. The price is expected to rise 14.35% during the following month, according to analysts’ optimistic short-term projections. Even more optimistic is the one-year projection, which predicts a 99% increase. Even while these numbers show strong growth potential, the cryptocurrency must hold onto crucial support levels to prevent steep declines. What’s Next For XRP? After a sharp increase, XRP is currently trading at $1.14. Thanks to rekindled enthusiasm and macroeconomic conditions that favor digital assets, its ecosystem seems stronger than ever. However, traders should continue to exercise caution. Given that XRP’s RSI is at its highest level since 2017, a consolidation phase may be imminent before another breakthrough takes place.

36565562,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=101995,1732019304,"This Time is Different for Bitcoin, Samson Mow Maintains","Samson Mow emphasizes that the current Bitcoin cycle may differ from previous ones amid market comparisons and historical trends. Bitcoin's price has recently reclaimed the $91,000 mark amid ongoing short-term fluctuations. As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $91,511, reflecting a notable 3.41% gain over the last week. Amid this movement, Samson Mow, CEO of JAN3, identified a historical movement suggesting this time might be different from previous cycle tops.Comparing Previous Bitcoin CyclesMow released a chart comparing Bitcoin’s performance across four distinct market cycles. Using a logarithmic scale, the chart illustrates Bitcoin's exponential growth since its inception. The earliest cycle, from 2011 to 2013, shows the most significant volatility, with Bitcoin achieving a 10x growth within 450 days. This cycle ended with a 500X growth after 730 days from the earlier bottom.In contrast, the 2015-2017 cycle presented steadier growth. By day 856, Bitcoin’s value had increased tenfold, eventually surging by 100 times its cycle low by the end of the 2017 bull run. The subsequent 2018-2021 cycle experienced slower initial growth, with over 10x increase by day 960. The cycle peaked below a 50-fold gain by the end of the 2021 bull market. Although current cycle trends align more closely with these later periods, showing below 10X growth after 740 days from its cycle low, Mow believes this time is different.https://twitter.com/Excellion/status/1858663360520433970Meanwhile, Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy Digital, also shared Mow’s chart but instead noted that the asset is on track with historical trends. Thorn added that Bitcoin now outperforms the 2015-2017 cycle.Further Predictions Signal Optimism While the debate about Bitcoin's ongoing pattern continues, analysts have presented varying forecasts for BTC's near-term and long-term trajectory. Ali Martinez recently indicated that Bitcoin could rally to $150,000 in the coming days before a significant correction. Drawing parallels with previous cycles, Martinez pointed out that during the 2016/2017 and 2020/2021 bull runs, Bitcoin surged over 120% past its prior all-time high before facing up to 39% corrections.Meanwhile, Fundstrat's Head of Research, Tom Lee, has taken a more cautious approach. Speaking on CNBC, Lee maintained that Bitcoin could surpass $100,000 by the end of 2024. Yet Lee maintains a $500,000 target beyond 2024, considering factors like Bitcoin ETFs and potential interest rate reductions.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX | RESEARCH,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/19/this-time-is-different-for-bitcoin-samson-mow-maintains/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=this-time-is-different-for-bitcoin-samson-mow-maintains,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

In a recent analysis , Cardano bull Dan Gamberdello has speculated an impending bullish outburst for ADA. The market speculator and YouTuber asserts that Cardano would break out from a well-structured price pattern for more upsides.Analyst Says ADA’s Next Upside Will Target $0.90Cardano’s bullish upsurge has lost steam amidst a broader market consolidation in the past few days. The ninth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is down 2.24% in the past 24 hours and 9.7% from its famous November 16 price rally to a multi-year high of $0.8117.Meanwhile, Gambardello acknowledged the cooling rally, noting that Cardano “took a rest for a couple of days.” He then insisted that the digital asset looks poised to continue its upside, citing a possible breakout from a price structure.The Cardano bull shares a 4H ADAUSD chart, noting that the digital asset has formed a bullish symmetrical triangle while it consolidated. He emphasized that the triangle has pulled Cardano into the green 20-day moving average, establishing a “really nice structure.” Furthermore, Gambardello shows that ADA is approaching the top of this symmetrical triangle and could break from the pattern imminently.

Famous market commentator Armando Pantoja has insisted that something eventful is imminent for XRP as on-chain activity continues to impress. In a Monday post , he drew the attention of his audience to the surging accumulation of the XRPL native token amidst growing bullish sentiments.Whales Ramp Up XRP AcquisitionPantoja emphasized the fever-pitch accumulation of the sixth-largest cryptocurrency, per on-chain data. The pundit noted that XRP whales stacked 453.3 million XRP, valued at $526 million, in a week amid growing price uptick expectations.Notably, an earlier The Crypto Basic report confirms Pantoja’s assertion. The piece shows that whales holding between 1 million and 10 million XRP added the substantial amount to their stash and now command 18% of XRP’s circulating supply.Furthermore, the recent acquisition took holdings of these high-caliber whales to a two-month high. The notable accumulation also coincided with XRP’s surge past the $1 price mark to a three-year high of $1.26.Holdings Among 100k+ Whales Hits ATHMeanwhile, Pantoja shared another piece of data signaling an impressive uptick in whales holding 100,000 XRP and above. According to the data, these whales' stash has reached a new all-time high of 51.59 billion XRP.The unprecedented milestone has propelled these addresses to command a staggering amount of XRP’s circulating supply. These wallets now account for 85% of the asset’s supply, reaching an 11-month high.Huge XRP Price ExpectationsPutting Pantoja’s big XRP expectations into perspective, notable analysts have speculated ambitious prices for the coin. For instance, market commentator Bobby A insisted that XRP would target higher prices like $3, $8, $11, and $13.Furthermore, Tony Severino, a Chartered Market Technician, asserted that XRP would surge a staggering 1,710% to the $20 price mark. The analyst cited a sharp rally as XRP enters the fifth wave of its Elliot Wave structure.XRP Consolidates Amid Surging Bullish SentimentsWhile bullish sentiments and expectations of big moves continue to swell, XRP has consolidated following a mild pullback. The asset has joined a widely expected broader market correction in preparation for its next upside.For context, XRP is down 14% from its November 16 peak of $1.26. The XRPL native token has also corrected 3% in the past 24 hours but is aggressively guarding the $1 price mark.At the time of writing, XRP trades at $1.105 with a market valuation of $62.69 billion.",POSITIVE,XRP,MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/19/pundit-says-something-big-is-coming-for-xrp/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pundit-says-something-big-is-coming-for-xrp,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

The decentralized exchange has more than 400,000 users signed up for early access and a community of millions that follow it on social media and messaging platforms.  Crypto Valley Exchange (CVEX), a decentralized exchange (DEX) focused on trading crypto futures and options, said it plans to go live on Jan. 8 following a period of testing.  The exchange, partly owned by Saxo Bank founder Lars Seier Christensen, emerges into a market dominated by the Panama-based centralized exchange Deribit with more than 400,000 users signed up for early access and ""a community"" of millions who follow it on social media and messaging platforms, according to a press release.  Futures and options account for a huge amount of trading in traditional markets, but crypto derivatives are disproportionately small, CEO James Davies, a co-founder of the company, said. Large centralized exchanges historically opted for payments licenses, which didn’t allow for derivatives trading, though a gap in the regulations regarding perpetuals allowed those products to be introduced.  In general, though, the options market has been held back, but it should be huge in crypto because there's all this risk passing around, Davies said in an interview.  “We've got a perpetual based market because nobody built infrastructure outside of that,” Davies said. “We know futures are better and that there are thousands of projects that want to hedge and that would prefer to trade options on-chain than use expensive OTC options.”  CVEX will see its mainnet arrive on Arbitrum Stylus, a version of the fast and cheap Ethereum overlay blockchain that uses WebAssembly-compatible languages.  Users will be able to avoid the high funding fees typically tied to perpetual futures on other platforms, and the exchange promises trading fees ""up to 16x lower"" than incumbent centralized exchanges (makers are charged just 0.002%, and takers only 0.003%).

36558606,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653732,1732014059,"Bitcoin Hashrate Falls Off, Miners Expecting Pause In Bull Run?","On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Hashrate has seen a setback recently, a potential indication that miners may not believe the asset’s run would last. Bitcoin Mining Hashrate Has Declined Since Its All-Time High The “Hashrate” refers to a metric that keeps track of the miners’ total computing power currently attached to the Bitcoin network. This indicator’s value is measured in terms of hashes per second (H/s) or the larger and more practical, terahashes per second (TH/s). Related Reading: Is $135,000 Bitcoin’s Current Ceiling? This Model Says So When the value of this metric registers an increase, it means new miners are joining the network, and old ones are expanding their farms. Such a trend implies that blockchain is a lucrative opportunity for these chain validators. On the other hand, the declining indicator suggests some miners have decided to disconnect their rigs from the network, potentially because they can’t break even anymore. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 7-day average of the Bitcoin Mining Hashrate over the past year: As displayed in the above graph, the 7-day average Bitcoin Hashrate had sharply moved up earlier and set new records. However, the metric has dropped since peaking near the 755 million TH/s mark at the start of this month. The earlier uptrend in the indicator resulted from the positive price action that the asset had been enjoying, as the price is directly linked to the miners’ revenue. There are two ways that these chain validators make their income: the transaction fees and the block subsidy. The former is dependent on traffic conditions and can drastically change from day to day. The latter, on the other hand, has very specific constraints attached to it. The block subsidy remains fixed in BTC value for about four years, at the end of which an event called the Halving cuts it exactly in half. These rewards are also given out at a more or less constant rate, meaning miners’ daily block subsidy income in BTC terms always remains quite predictable.

Whenever the price rises, so does the block subsidy revenue of the miners. This is why the Hashrate tends to see growth in bullish periods. Bitcoin has been exploring new highs recently, but the Hashrate has interestingly stayed muted. The indicator is around 723 million, which means it has declined by more than 4% since the peak.

With a bullish revival, Theta Network is bouncing back into positive price action. The breakout from the trendline and range coincides with a break above the 200-day EMA and key Fibonacci levels.Will this reversal rally propel the altcoin price to the $2.50 mark? Let’s take a closer look at Theta Network price analysis to explore the potential.Theta Network (THETA) Price AnalysisIn the daily chart, the THETA price action shows a bullish reversal, giving a breakout of a consolidation range. The consolidation range extended from the $1 psychological price to $1.59. During this phase, Theta's price action overcame the bearish resistance trendline but struggled to break through a key overhead resistance level. THETA Price Chart With the broader crypto market recovery, bullish momentum has pushed Theta's price beyond the narrow range. Last night, a bullish engulfing candle formed, marking a nearly 20% surge and breaking the consolidation range.Currently, Theta is trading at $1.71, marking a 71% rise in 15 days from the $1 mark. With the range breakout, the intraday doji candle seems like a potential retest of the resistance zone. With growing anticipation of a post-retest reversal, the immediate target for Theta's price is $1.95. This level aligns with the 38.20% Fibonacci retracement, making it a key resistance point.As the bullish momentum continues, the 50-100-day EMA lines are nearing a bullish crossover, signaling an increased likelihood of a golden crossover on the daily chart.However, the recent price surge has driven the RSI closer to the overbought zone, which could indicate a minor pullback before a continued upward trend.Will THETA Token Cross $2?If the bullish trend continues, the 38.20% Fibonacci breakout will likely result in a bull run beyond the $2.50 psychological mark. Based on this assumption, the 61.80% Fibonacci level at $2.53 is the breakout target for Theta. Conversely, dropping below $1.59 will nullify the range breakout and likely retest the 200-day EMA at $1.4298.",POSITIVE,THETA,ALTCOIN | MARKET | TRADING | THETA,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/19/theta-price-soars-71-eyes-2-53-as-bullish-momentum-builds/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=theta-price-soars-71-eyes-2-53-as-bullish-momentum-builds,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

New legislation imposing transaction limits and markup caps in several states has significantly impacted Bitcoin Depot's operational environment. The CEO's optimism about future growth contrasts with ongoing operational challenges and risks from potential further regulatory actions. The proposed dividend strategy is questionable, given BTM's declining revenues, negative equity, and the typical volatility in the cryptocurrency industry. This is a follow-up to the earlier Bitcoin Depot ( BTM ) I covered in March, titled “ Bitcoin Depot: Watchlist Worthy .” The stock caught my interest, being one of the very few Bitcoin (BTC-USD ) stocks that hadn't picked up from the momentum Bitcoin had seen since the floodgates of direct crypto investing were opened to traditional investors via the spot ETFs in January. In that piece, I expressed skepticism over the long-term viability of Bitcoin Depot’s business model compared to Bitcoin miners who have more room to diversify and streamline operations using a big part of their existing assets. Also, Bitcoin Depot’s high 23% markup on transactions, considering the availability of cheaper alternatives, like Moonpay, for converting Bitcoin to cash (and vice versa) was a significant concern. While this stock isn't exactly the most appealing Bitcoin-related stock, and the business model seems not as viable as those of exchanges like Coinbase or miners like Marathon, BTM is still worth keeping on the radar. Excerpt from previous BTM coverage. company presentation For readers who aren't familiar with the company’s operations, Bitcoin Depot is a Bitcoin-focused company that owns and operates a network of Bitcoin kiosks (also called Bitcoin ATMs or BTMs) in North America. The company currently commands around 23% of the total U.S. Bitcoin ATM market share and an 8% market share in Canada. In addition to physical BTMs, Bitcoin Depot also offers seamless crypto-to-cash conversion services via mobile apps. Since my last coverage, Bitcoin Depot has added 2,300 BTMs to its fleet in the U.S., bringing the total number to 8,300 BTMs currently. Bitcoin Depot initially guided for 8,000 BTMs by the end of CY24, but surpassed that target since Q2 and now exceeds the 8,000 BTMs guidance by an additional 300 BTMs. Bitcoin Depot also has 2,000 BTMs in inventory which it aims to strategically deploy in the coming months. On the surface, this aggressive expansion of the Bitcoin ATM fleet appears promising, but how does it translate to accretive value for the company? There could be more to it than meets the eye, and risks that could linger for the foreseeable future. Highlights from Bitcoin Depot's Q3 Results Since the start of 2024, the impact of new legislation that imposed daily transaction limits on Bitcoin ATMs and a cap on the markup Bitcoin ATM operators can charge, in some U.S. states, has been a main sticking point for Bitcoin ATM operators. This has prompted new operational strategies and diversification of business. As part of business diversification efforts, Bitcoin Depot in Q2 announced a Bitcoin portfolio strategy , similar to that of MicroStrategy ( MSTR ). Bitcoin Depot has also engaged in fleet relocation in Q3, moving Bitcoin ATM fleets from areas with low transaction volume to areas with potential higher usage rates. However, fleet relocation didn't improve sales in Q3. According to Bitcoin Depot’s management, the full impact of fleet relocation might not be immediately visible in the quarterly result, as improvements take time to materialize. Total revenue in Q3 dropped both on a sequential and YoY basis. Q3 sales of $135.3 million were a 17% sequential decline and a 25% YoY decline. Adjusted non-GAAP EBITDA declined 33.9% YoY to $9.2 million in Q3. The new legislation has made it a tough operational environment for Bitcoin Depot this fiscal year. Over the past year, Bitcoin Depot has faced regulatory challenges in California, Connecticut, Vermont and Minnesota that has affected the business financially. This has created a year-over-year decline in revenue and EBITDA. However, today, we are much more prepared to address how states might approach regulating our industry. And this gives us a greater influence when regulation may be drafted. We believe 2024 is the low point in our business, and there is much more growth ahead. Brandon Mintz, CEO, during Q3 2024 conference call. While the CEO sees 2024 and the impact of the legislation as a low point in the company's business, and anticipates growth ahead, I believe the company’s operational challenges are a persistent impediment that poses risks to the long-term viability of the business in the U.S. The Bitcoin ATM legislation in California went into effect in January this year and other states have followed suit. In Minnesota , the daily cap on transactions at crypto ATMs is set at $2,000, while in Vermont, the limit is $1,000 daily. Both states’ legislation went into effect mid-2024. The legislation in Minnesota also stipulates a consumer reimbursement mandate for any loss of funds; this rule could potentially add more costs to ATM operators’ business OpeX. Though Bitcoin Depot's CEO spoke with optimism during the Q3 conference call , projecting “much more growth ahead,” I am of the view that this optimism might be premature, as more stringent regulation could still be passed, and more states with BTM presence could adopt laws that include transaction limits and a cap on markup. In California, for example, where the legislation has had the biggest impact on Bitcoin Depot’s operations so far, there is already a broader regulatory framework that will go into effect next year. The broader regulation called the Digital Financial Assets Law stipulates mandatory licensing requirements for BTM operators, which will take effect from July next year, and transaction fees cap of $5 or 15% max of the transaction value, which will take effect from January 1, 2026. coinatnradar.com Though Bitcoin Depot has expanded its business beyond the U.S. into new markets, commencing operations in Puerto Rico and planned launch in Australia in 2025, the U.S. remains the major hub for Bitcoin ATMs for now (the U.S. accounts for around 90% of global BTM installations) and most likely will be for the foreseeable future. Overseas expansion will likely not make up much for the operational hurdles caused by U.S. regulations that have been negatively impacting sales. Even outside the U.S., there will likely not be an easy room for growth for companies like Bitcoin Depot. For example, in the UK, regulators have long deemed Bitcoin ATMs illegal since 2022 and have not made any recent revision to that stance, and in most European countries, the same daily transaction cap exists for transactions at Bitcoin ATMs. Bitcoins ATMs are physical money transmitters; hence, as their popularity grows, national and state licensing and regulatory compliance for BTM operators doesn't come as a surprise. And as Bitcoin Depot’s core business revolves around its Bitcoin ATMs, thereby being heavily reliant on transaction and markup fees, regulations that impose transaction and markup caps directly threaten the company's revenue. Bitcoin Depot’s Dividend Strategy: A Questionable Move In the Q3 conference call, Bitcoin Depot's CEO announced a dividend payment strategy which, in all fairness, I consider as “window dressing.” Like I have highlighted earlier in this article, regulations that directly place a cap on transactions, markup and fees are a direct threat to Bitcoin Depot’s revenues. With the declining revenues and operational challenges, I don't think a dividend declaration is a financially prudent strategy. ""We have been exploring with our Board the best way to utilize our cash to create the most value for shareholders, and we believe starting a cash dividend at some point in 2025 will allow shareholders to benefit. At this time, we are not aware of any other U.S. company whose primary business is in the cryptocurrency industry offering a dividend. - Brandon Mintz, CEO” Part of my concerns stems from the CEO’s own words: “we are not aware of any other U.S. company whose primary business is in the cryptocurrency industry offering a dividend.” There is a reason crypto-focused companies typically avoid dividend payments. I strongly believe that with the risks, volatility, and seasonality associated with crypto and crypto-focused businesses, investing in growth opportunities should be prioritized over dividend payment. Data by YCharts Data by YCharts While Bitcoin Depot generates enough cash from its operations and free cash flow remains positive (though showing some decline lately), it is worth pointing out that the company also currently has negative equity (liabilities exceed assets) and a negative debt-to-equity ratio at -2.71. This adds more layer of uncertainty to the long-term sustainability of the dividend payments. BTM Stock Insider Selling: A Red Flag for Investors? Investors who follow BTM closely know that there has been ongoing insider selling by CEO Brandon Mintz, who also controls over 50% of the company’s voting rights through his ownership of BT Assets. The CEO set up BT Assets in November 2023 and is the sole member of BT Assets, which controls 41,193,024 Class V shares. These Class V shares are convertible 1:1 into Class A shares, thus allowing the CEO to retain significant influence over the company’s voting rights. As such, Bitcoin Depot is effectively a “controlled company.” There have been one or two cases of substantial insider selling by the CEO in the past, and the timing of the sale raises eyebrows. There was a substantial sale of $5 million worth of BTM shares by the CEO in April at $1.72 per share. And a recent sale of 125,000 shares of Class A common stock for approximately $376,487 at a weighted average price of $3.0119 which is around the recent local top for the stock where the price peaked, raises questions about the timing of the sale. $5 million insider sale by the CEO on April 26, 2024 (insiderscreener.com) Takeaway Revisiting BTM after eight months, I lean towards reiterating a “hold” rating instead of a buy, despite the aggressive kiosk expansion Bitcoin Depot has embarked on since last coverage in March. BTM shows expansion of business operations, but there are also risks to the business’s long-term viability. Bitcoin Depot’s attempt to implement a dividend strategy, despite ongoing operational pressures and a negative equity position, raises questions about the company’s long-term financial standing. Despite declining revenues, BTM has surged by over 28% in one month. A closer look has shown that fundamentals haven't improved much for BTM; the recent price surge is mostly linked to Bitcoin's own rally since Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. elections, which has seen crypto stocks pick up momentum.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4738595-bitcoin-depot-recent-surge-is-tied-to-bitcoins-sympathy-play?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36558231.jpeg

Over the past few weeks, Bessent has made several visits to Mar-a-Lago , Trump’s private estate in Florida, sparking speculation about his chances of securing the position. Known for his successful career in finance, Bessent previously served as the chief investment officer for Soros Fund Management before starting his own firm, Key Square Group. His deep understanding of global markets and economic trends could make him a strong choice to manage the nation's finances. However, the race for Treasury Secretary remains competitive. Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has recently expressed his support for Howard Lutnick, the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, a global financial services firm. Lutnick, who is playing a key role in Trump’s transition team, is seen as another strong candidate . His decades-long experience in financial services, leadership during challenging times, and ability to navigate economic complexities add weight to his candidacy. Musk has been closely associated with Trump since the 2016 election and is thought to have influence in shaping the new administration's decisions. Over the weekend, Musk voiced his preference for Lutnick, highlighting his financial acumen and leadership capabilities. Musk himself, known for his work in technology and innovation, is also deeply connected to the financial world, owning a significant amount of Bitcoin ( BTC ). This connection to digital assets could signal an interest in incorporating modern financial tools into future economic strategies. The position of Treasury Secretary is critical to shaping U.S. economic policy . The individual selected will oversee the Department of the Treasury, manage national debt, and advise on key financial decisions affecting the economy. The Treasury Secretary also plays a vital role in international financial relations, representing the U.S. in global economic forums and discussions. As Trump finalizes his cabinet, the choice between Bessent and Lutnick will be an important decision with far-reaching implications. Bessent’s expertise in investment and global markets could provide stability and strategic insight. On the other hand, Lutnick’s leadership experience and understanding of financial systems make him a compelling candidate as well. While no official announcement has been made, the discussions and endorsements highlight the significance of this appointment. The Treasury Secretary’s role will be crucial in determining how the new administration handles fiscal policy , international trade, and challenges such as rising debt and economic recovery. This decision will also signal the administration’s priorities, whether it leans toward traditional financial strategies or embraces innovative approaches like blockchain and cryptocurrency. Observers are closely watching for any updates from Trump’s team. Whoever is chosen will face the task of managing the economic landscape during a time of global uncertainty and rapid change, ensuring the U.S. remains a leading player in the world economy.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/who-will-be-a-treasury-secretary-at-the-trump-administration-,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36556928.jpeg

Recent data from market intelligence platform Santiment reveals a decline in active wallets across several top-cap cryptocurrencies. This trend is often linked to fear, uncertainty, doubt (FUD), or capitulation among less experienced traders.According to Santiment, these conditions may paradoxically act as bullish indicators as long-term holders tend to accumulate assets during such periods.Cardano Wallet Decline After Major Price PumpFor Cardano, the network has seen a decrease of 34,931 wallets over the past month, representing a 0.78% drop. Notably, in just the last 13 days, 29,976 wallets became inactive.Santiment attributes this pattern to short-term profit-taking among retail investors as it coincides with major price gains. Notably, ADA has surged by over 108% in the last two weeks, reclaiming its yearly highs. However, the rally is cooling as ADA stalls around $0.7326.Santiment noted that historically, retail traders tend to lock in profits when bullish momentum builds, which explains the decline in ADA wallets. Meanwhile, Santiment data suggests that the decline in wallets aligns with long-term accumulation by larger holders.Essentially, the downward trend in wallet activity is a positive sign for ADA’s long-term price prospects. As retail investors dump their holdings on small gains, whales, with a long-term perspective, buy back the tokens.Bitcoin and Dogecoin Follow PatternsBitcoin (BTC) has also experienced a reduction of 15,120 wallets in just the past four days. Similarly, Dogecoin (DOGE) saw a steep decline of 24,456 wallets within a single day. Both assets exhibit patterns consistent with retail traders exiting positions after significant gains. Santiment notes that such reductions in wallet activity can often be a bullish sign, suggesting long-term price stability. History Supports Bullish PredictionsIn addition to wallet activity, historical analysis of Cardano offers insights into potential price trajectories. Analyst Ali Martinez recently projected that ADA could surge by over 713%, reaching $6 by late 2025. Martinez’s prediction is based on similarities between the current market cycle and Cardano’s rapid growth during the 2020-2021 bull run.Other analysts, including Ben Armstrong, have also weighed in on ADA’s future, estimating a price peak of $5 if market conditions remain favorable.",POSITIVE,ADA | DOGE,ADA | BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/19/over-29900-wallets-exit-cardano-after-108-price-surge-what-history-suggests-for-ada-price/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=over-29900-wallets-exit-cardano-after-108-price-surge-what-history-suggests-for-ada-price,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

While this surge has heightened investors’ hope, analysts seem to be paying more attention to a deeper, long-term shift that could impact BTC’s future market price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Demand Outpaces Supply – On-Chain Metrics Reveal Low Seller Volume Market Shift Incoming For Bitcoin According to CryptoQuant analyst KriptoBaykusV2, an evident shift observed in the Bitcoin’s market is from its dwindling exchange reserves. The analyst reveals that the reserves have fallen from roughly 3.2 million at the beginning of 2023 to under 2.6 million today, signaling that more investors are moving their BTC from exchanges to cold storage. This movement typically suggests long-term holding intentions and less immediate selling pressure, which could lead to reduced market liquidity. KriptoBaykusV2 notes that a shrinking exchange reserve could pave the way for a potential market correction, especially as Bitcoin approaches the psychological threshold of $100,000. As prices rise, new market entrants and existing holders may become more inclined to take profits, potentially leading to an increase in sell orders and a temporary surge in exchange reserves. A Long-Term Bullish Outlook Despite the potential market correction, the broader implications of Bitcoin’s shrinking exchange reserves remain noteworthy. This decline also highlights a structural trend that may favor a long-term bullish outlook. The CryptoQuant analyst mentioned that as more investors choose to hold their Bitcoin off exchanges, the overall supply on trading platforms decreases, contributing to reduced liquidity. Should demand rise, this scarcity effect could intensify upward price pressures, potentially fueling the next phase of a bull market. KriptoBaykusV2 also emphasizes that the current behavior of Bitcoin holders reflects a maturing market. Unlike previous cycles marked by rapid speculation, today’s investors appear to be making more informed, strategic decisions. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Sold Over 3,000 BTC In The Past 48 Hours – Consolidation Phase Ahead? This change is further highlighted by growing institutional interest in the space. Institutions often adopt longer-term strategies, moving their holdings to cold wallets for security, further contributing to the depletion of exchange reserves. The analyst particularly wrote: One critical point here is that investors seem to be holding the Bitcoin they withdraw from exchanges as part of a long-term strategy. This signals a maturing market, with more informed investment decisions. If institutional interest continues to grow, the pace of reserve depletion could accelerate, further increasing upward pressure on prices.

MSTR's unique strategy involves issuing securities backed by BTC, creating significant value through a spread between BTC's CAGR and fiat cost of capital. Its BTC purchases are best thought of as revenue, and its rock bottom costs of capital are best thought of as costs of revenue. MSTR's market cap could potentially reach $690 billion to $3 trillion, driven by its unparalleled role in the BTC ecosystem and virtually impregnable moat of owning 1.3% of all BTC. Frankly, I got MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) wrong. I've been heavily long and consistently bullish on MSTR in my Seeking Alpha articles , but I didn't fully grasp the enormity of what they were doing. There haven't been many bullish voices for MSTR. Most people focus on the market cap's premium over the company's BTC holdings and scream ""overvalued"" and ""strong sell."" This was the mistake of Kerrisdale Capital , which would be seriously underwater on their trade if they had kept it open. Last time, I warned against long BTC, short MSTR pair trades. In the past, I have focused on the fact that BTC per share was growing, which justifies a premium. After all, most stocks trade at over 1X their book value because they are expected to grow their book value per share over time. I also focused on MSTR's use of intelligent leverage, where they sold their implied volatility in the form of convertible debt. This allows them to leverage BTC with near 0 interest rates, increase their volatility, and do more convertible issuances at better terms. MSTR's convertible bonds have outperformed BTC and the S&P 500. And its common stock has outperformed every single company in the index, since it started buying BTC in 2021. MSTR Has Outperformed Every Stock In the SPX (MSTR) MSTR Convertibles Have Outperformed (MSTR) For a long time, this was my perspective of MSTR. It was far more correct than those who said MSTR was a leveraged BTC fund which must trade at the NAV. But it was far off from what MSTR actually is, which is what I'm writing this article about. To set the stage: MSTR is a ""meta"" bet on BTC. By this, I mean it is more of a pure play on BTC than BTC itself. This was shocking to me because I thought nothing could be more of a financial bet on an asset than owning the asset itself. Now for the practical revelation: MSTR is the only Bitcoin investment bank and will, in the future, be the most well-capitalized Bitcoin investment bank ever. Let's see why. Bitcoin's Only Investment Bank MicroStrategy is like Bitcoin's investment bank because all MicroStrategy securities (convertible bonds and common stock for now, but the issuance of other securities is also on the table) are backed ultimately by BTC. Technically, there is also MicroStrategy's software business, but for simplicity we can omit this from the conversation. Note that I'm using ""MicroStrategy"" and not ""MSTR"" on purpose to distinguish the company from the common stock security—I will do this throughout the article and only use ""MSTR"" when specifically talking about the common stock. MicroStrategy is an operation that buys BTC by raising money from capital markets. But another way to understand this flow of cash is to think of Bitcoin itself as the only client of MicroStrategy, the investment bank. A traditional investment bank securitizes the commitments of their client. It gives these securities to the capital markets in return for cash. It then passes the cash off to its client and takes a cut for the work. The client uses the cash to increase its value via business operations and pay off commitments: dividends and interest for equity and debt, respectively. Investment banking is a central component of any advanced, modern economy because it helps link savers and borrowers, enabling the intertemporal exchange of money. This is the function of all capital markets. This is basically what MicroStrategy does. MicroStrategy securitizes BTC by issuing MicroStrategy securities. These are like Bitcoin securities because it's all backed by the BTC held by MicroStrategy. MicroStrategy then sells the securities to the capital markets and gives all the cash to its client, Bitcoin. Now, the only main difference is that rather than taking a cut in cash, MicroStrategy's cut is owning BTC. This would be like a traditional investment bank taking a cut by keeping some of the equity or debt of its client. Remember this point. A good investment bank is able to square the needs of its client and the capital markets. Imagine if the markets really wanted bonds and a client wanted to raise money. A good investment bank provides the research and consulting services which informs the client, ""Hey! Don't do an equity raise, these people love debt right now, and you'd get a better deal."" It is a win-win. The market gets what it wants, and the client raises more money at favorable terms. This is also what MicroStrategy does for Bitcoin. I've listened to the last three MicroStrategy earnings calls live (because MSTR is a huge chunk of my portfolio) and they always mention that they are looking for ""favorable"" terms from the market. If the appetite for convertibles is good, then they issue convertibles. An example of this was the week before 20 September , where they got $1.01 billion from convertibles. If the appetite for MSTR shares is strong, then they do at-the-market (ATM) offerings. An example of this was the week before 11 November , where they got $2.03 billion from ATM offerings. MicroStrategy is that good investment bank which maximizes the money raised for its client, Bitcoin. Another thing a good investment bank does for clients is help market the clients' security offerings. Traditionally, this looks like publishing sell-side research reports which explain the investment merits. The most important result is that the price of the client's stock goes up because the buy-side becomes aware of the facts, and they start taking positions. This is also precisely what MicroStrategy does for Bitcoin. MicroStrategy considers itself the world's first "" Bitcoin Development Company ."" The Executive Chairman, Michael Saylor, has spent hundreds of hours on podcasts talking about Bitcoin. MicroStrategy hosts events like Bitcoin For Corporations, in which they are open-source their playbook for generating excess returns via a Bitcoin treasury strategy. Like the role of traditional investment banks, all of this action serves to increase the knowledge and awareness of BTC among the global investing and finance community. There are many more examples of how MicroStrategy behaves like an investment bank with Bitcoin as its only client. But I'll mention only one more because this one is particularly important, and it is also a distinction from traditional investment banks. MicroStrategy's BTC purchases are effectively cornering the BTC market by removing supply from the market. Saylor has been adamant that he will never sell the BTC. The force of raising billions of dollars and piling everything into BTC is a major factor which has and will continue to increase BTC's price. The other force is BTC's absolute scarcity—when supply is removed from the market, there will never be more supply to replace it. MSTR's meteoric rise is itself an ongoing marketing campaign for a Bitcoin acquisition strategy. I think every single CFO, public or private, must contend with the fact that they might be giving their shareholders suboptimal stock performance by ignoring BTC. Every single informed investor, I believe, must contend with the fact that if they don't own something that is acquiring BTC, they are possibly depriving themselves to suboptimal performance (and thus far those equities without BTC have demonstrably underperformed—this is just the objective fact). But the result of more companies doing this is that the cornering of the BTC market will become much stronger. MicroStrategy is one public company. If 10 public companies start doing this, there is going to be much more demand pressure on BTC. How Does This Impact MSTR Value? MSTR is the equity position in this investment bank. Value accrues to equity holders of financial institutions from a spread. Banks lend at one rate and borrow at another. Investment banks sell securities at one price and take a cut, which means they effectively ""bought"" the securities at a lower price. MSTR's spread is between the fiat cost of capital and BTC's fiat CAGR. BTC's CAGR is well over 50% on most multi-year windows. The fiat cost of capital with convertible bonds is extremely low. Bonds are a bit higher. The equity cost of capital is even higher—think S&P 500 with a higher beta. But none of this is remotely close to BTC's CAGR. Thus, there is a substantial spread which accrues to shareholders. I think this is how one should see MSTR. When you take on this perspective, the premium over the BTC holdings becomes a much more remote aspect of the valuation picture. People are tunnel visioned on the premium, but they really shouldn't be. Here's where the premium is important. Remember how I said that the core divergence from traditional investment banks is that MicroStrategy holds the BTC, which is like a traditional investment bank holding onto a bunch of shares from the deal they do with their clients? A normal investment bank would get the cash and distribute it to shareholders in a dividend or buyback. MSTR takes the cash and distributes it to shareholders in the form of a higher BTC per assumed diluted share. They call this BTC Yield. Now it should all come together. You don't have to think of the premium as a function of BTC Yield. This was my mistake before: I thought that the premium was justified because BTC Yield was positive. You do have to think of the premium as the investment bank business, which captures a gigantic spread between BTC's fiat CAGR and the fiat cost of capital that the investment bank is accessing for its only client. Put differently, MSTR is best regarded as three components, not two. The classical, and mistaken, two components are: BTC holdings and software business. The actual three components are: BTC holdings, software business, Bitcoin's investment bank. And ""Bitcoin's investment bank"" is a tremendous profit machine (as long as BTC maintains its CAGR). It just never crosses the income statement as actual earnings, and that has confused everyone. It has a huge amount of ""accrued revenue"" because over the long run this value accrues to the equity in the form of unrealized capital gains on BTC. MicroStrategy is misunderstood because it is straddling two different monetary standards. Fiat accounting forces the treatment of BTC as a balance sheet item. The economic reality is that the BTC purchased is actually a revenue to MSTR, just as the revenue for a bank is the interest received on loans. Here's another way to see the reality. What I am calling the ""Bitcoin's investment bank"" business segment must have costs which are reflected in the financials of the business. There are already revenues: I am arguing that revenues are the BTC that MicroStrategy purchases. The costs are interest payments on convertible debt and dilutions on the equity as a result of convertibles and ATM offerings. To tie it back to the bank example: BTC is revenue to MSTR, while interest expenses and dilution are the costs. Interest on loans is revenue to a bank while interest paid to depositors are the costs. Addressing One Rebuttal Now, you might be thinking: ""But an actual investment bank has to give the money it raises to its client. You can't just treat the money MicroStrategy raises as revenues which flow to MSTR! If you claim Bitcoin is the client, then Bitcoin needs to be taking that money to do something with it to make BTC more successful! And if Bitcoin is taking that money, then how can you say that it is a revenue to MSTR, which is a separate entity?"" If this is your rebuke, then it means you deeply understand the financial sector. If you didn't think about this, you are likely in good company. The critique is saying that there are some awkward situations when you take the ""Bitcoin as a client"" observation to its logical conclusion because Bitcoin is an inanimate thing, and it isn't a group of people working towards the human endeavor of value creation. Here's why I think we can look past this rebuke, and effectively sidestep it. Again, MicroStrategy's underwriting fee is a stake in the client. It is not dollars. An underwriting fee is revenue investment banks receive from clients. When MicroStrategy buys BTC, it is literally giving the money to Bitcoin. Bitcoin immediately takes that money and ""creates"" value because the capital injection increases the market cap of the absolutely scarce BTC, all else equal. Bitcoin then gives the BTC—the underwriting fee—back to MicroStrategy. The dollars MicroStrategy raised go to Bitcoin, and then higher-valued BTC (due to the capital injection) immediately comes back to MicroStrategy. The money indeed went to the client and went back to MicroStrategy as revenue, just in the form of BTC. This happened at the same moment in time. And what do I mean by ""Bitcoin"" as an entity? It really is the collective of everything and everyone involved with Bitcoin. If you hold BTC, run a node, are a miner, use BTC for payments, you are part of Bitcoin. It is the network. Networks have value because people use them. So when ""Bitcoin"" gives MicroStrategy some BTC as a revenue, what's happening is some holder of BTC paid MicroStrategy the investment bank for raising money for the network. The holder got some dollars and MicroStrategy got its BTC. Hence, Bitcoin got the money and paid the revenue right back. What Else Can The Investment Bank Do? Once you internalize that MicroStrategy is Bitcoin's investment bank, you should see that MSTR can chop up the risk profile of its issued BTC securities by designing the covenants in creative ways. So far, they've only dealt with common stock issuance, a bit of secured debt, and convertibles. But they can also issue preferred shares, mezz debt, warrants, and structured products. These can all be adjusted to whatever risk and return profile the market wants. The only rule is that the cost of capital (which means the commitments within these securities) is lower than the expected CAGR of BTC. Everything else is absorbed by MSTR common stock And this is an extremely profound feature. Many investors desire lower volatility, lower returns. Any volatility or returns from BTC which is in excess of what these investors desire accrues to the common stock. This is how MSTR has 120 IV and meteoric growth. MSTR is the volatility and return dampener for the securities issuances of MicroStrategy. Think of conservation of energy and mass as a metaphor for what is happening. BTC's returns and volatility comes into the system, but many investors don't want something that volatile, even if the returns are great. So MSTR takes in the BTC and absorbs a chunk of the returns and a chunk of the volatility into itself, while giving these other investors the precise return and risk profile they desire. Total volatility and returns across the system remains the same: it all comes from BTC, and there is a conservation of volatility and returns within the system. The financial engineering of MSTR comes from chopping up and distributing the desired quantity of returns and volatility to each class of investor. As I've covered many times before, this creates immense volatility in MSTR, which allows MicroStrategy to issue convertible debt at near 0% interest rates because they are effectively selling the volatility and monetizing the second moment of the distribution . But MicroStrategy getting more BTC translates to the investment bank segment absorbing more BTC to chop up into risk and return profiles. As Saylor says in the Q3 earnings call : We think ultimately it's going to be good for investors. It's going to be good for our common stock shareholders. There's really nobody's really losing because as I've said before, it's like bitcoin is giving us 50 vol, 50 ARR. And the world's full of people that would be delighted to take 20 vol, 20 ARR. And if we gave it to them over a long enough timeframe, it looks like—it's like a 60% BTC spread product where $100 million of capital results in $60 million of BTC gains for our shareholders. And it still results in a very compelling instrument that's very easy to understand for a new class of investors. What other risk and return profiles are there? Preferred stock can be structured to give the investor some number of returns via dividends. This gives them some upside and little downside. And generally stable cash flows. There are also convertibles on preferred stock. This would give the investor the option to acquire the above risk and return profile. There are warrants, which are effectively pure long-term call options on MSTR. I have stated in the past that MicroStrategy can issue warrants to buy BTC calls. After all, MSTR has a significantly higher IV than BTC, so this could be a very natural arbitrage. There are different classes of debt with various covenants which might be useful to investors. And of course there are structured products for ISDA-holders. These can literally be designed to fit any risk/ return profile. The point is that convertibles are the tip of the iceberg for all the different securities markets which MicroStrategy the investment bank can do business in. With every issuance, its client, Bitcoin, gets a few more billion dollars in capital, which pushes up the BTC market cap by a lot more than a few billion dollars. Investment Bank Valuation So if the BTC purchases are revenues and the interest rate and dilution are the cost of revenues, then we can redo MSTR's financials to reflect this view of economic reality. You can see the entire history of MicroStrategy BTC purchases on Michael Saylor (MicroStrategy) Portfolio Tracker . I simply took those entries and aggregated them by quarter starting from Q1 of 2021. MSTR BTC Purchases (saylortracker, compiled by Author) This reflects (in order from left to right): the total cost of all BTC purchased in the quarter, the total value of that BTC on 16 November 2024, and the total unrealized capital gain thus far from that purchase. Since the BTC purchased is ""revenue"" to MSTR the investment bank, the cost of the BTC purchased column will be the quarterly ""revenue"" in our new model. A combination of MSTR's interest rate on debt and dilution is the cost of that revenue. I assume the cost of capital to be 15%, it's just under 2X the average annual return of the S&P 500, which is the equity cost of capital. I multiply the ""revenue"" by 0.85 to get the gross profit. Another way to say this is that 15% of the BTC MSTR purchases is actually lost on a per share basis due to a combination of interest expenses and dilution. And the column of P/L is best understood as each quarter's contribution to current accrued revenues. If you add up the entire column, then that is the total unrealized capital gains of MSTR's BTC holdings. This changes with the price of BTC. The restated columns look like this: MSTR Investment Bank Numbers (saylortracker, compiled by Author) So really, the investment bank was responsible for over $5 billion in gross profits this year alone. And it has grown tremendously year after year from 2023 and 2022. All of this is before we look at the accrued revenues. When you add all the accrued revenues together, you get $6.7 billion. I hope MSTR's $69 billion market cap is making more sense now. Even with just the $5 billion gross, we're looking at an adjusted TTM PE ratio of 14 (69 billion / 5 billion = 14). Here are the PE's for the five bulge bracket US investment banks: IB Multiples (Seeking Alpha) Pretty close. In fact, MSTR looks to be on the lower end of this list. You could say that the earnings on these multiples are net and not gross profits, but then I would counter by saying that $6.7 billion in accrued revenues with 100% profit margins (this is what unrealized capital gains are) were not included in my MSTR adjusted PE multiple. I could also counter by saying that I used the entire MSTR market cap (a third of which is unencumbered BTC) to divide by the investment bank earnings, thus using a much bigger numerator and inflating the end multiple. A third possible counter would be that I used a pretty enormous 15% cost of capital assumption. Nearly all of MSTR's debt has been under 1% interest rate. These are napkin math, so I want to make the margin of safety abundantly clear. These are three layers of significant margin of safety. Now we move to forward earnings. MicroStrategy announced a $42 billion capital raise to be carried out over the next 3 years. Nearly all proceeds will go to buying a stake in the client: Bitcoin. That is an average of $14 billion per year. Even if we assumed a 30% cost of capital, the gross profit from this would be $10 billion per year, which is 2X what MSTR did this year. So if the business has 100% growth and a 14 PE, that puts its PEG ratio at 0.14, again with all that margin of safety baked in. The bulge bracket numbers above indicate forward PEG non-GAAP ratios of 5–12X MSTR's 0.14 (I'm dropping C and JPM). This tells me that, conservatively, we have another 5X from the current market cap of $69 billion. Now we have to consider that MSTR has no competition as an investment bank for Bitcoin. It currently is the only one because no one else is issuing securities like MicroStrategy is. Also, MicroStrategy will always be the most well capitalized Bitcoin investment bank because no one else will have 1.3% of the BTC supply. Finally, it is only MSTR which has enough volatility to support such a convertible bonds strategy. If anyone else tried to add BTC to its balance sheet, its equity still wouldn't be as volatile as MSTR. This is effectively a permanent moat. So there probably should be a ""monopoly"" premium attached to MSTR too. An investor who wants traditional investment bank exposure can pick any of the several investment banks. An investor who wants a Bitcoin investment bank is left with only one option. If you are unconvinced about a monopoly premium, I urge you to take a look at how NVDA is priced relative to other chipmakers. Chips Multiples (Seeking Alpha) Market leaders always get a premium. And chips aren't even close to a monopoly. It would be much more extreme in a real monopoly. I will put this premium at 2–4X a traditional investment bank's multiples (which exist in a much more competitive market). If we apply the monopoly premium of 2X and then apply the PEG ratios, the investment bank's equity value alone is probably worth 10–24X what the current market cap is now, with all three layers of margin of safety still intact. If we remove those margins of safety, this makes MSTR a potentially multi-trillion dollar business. So, my official MSTR market cap target: somewhere between $690 billion and $3 trillion . Lastly, this analysis derives equity value based on the investment bank ""earnings"". We haven't yet covered the 279,420 BTC on the balance sheet. That is another $25 billion. MSTR also retains the option to deploy the BTC to earn additional income, which should, of course, increase the value of the raw holdings. One final quirk. Notice how the premium to BTC NAV completely disappears as a consideration after you see things this way? Risks And Caveats MSTR would fail if Bitcoin fails. The whole investment thesis is predicated upon accepting Bitcoin risk. But if BTC crashes, I'm not sure that would mean MSTR would crash harder. Positive BTC Yield should be regarded as an alpha on top of BTC performance, and I've argued this in the past too . I think it really comes down to the duration of a BTC drawdown. If the drawdown is extended and MSTR's price is below the conversion price on its convertibles, then convertible bonds investors might choose not to convert. This could force MSTR to issue more debt to pay off these demands, or even to sell BTC. That could be catastrophic for sentiment. I think it is also possible that MSTR could fail if regulators step in to squash the business. Maybe a law can be passed that securities issuances cannot be used to buy BTC, or something to that effect. This would certainly be a remote, tail risk. The incoming Trump administration is definitely more politically aligned with crypto than the outgoing administration. I think it is extremely unlikely for MSTR to get regulated away. One important caveat to the analysis and napkin math I did here is that I'm not saying the share price will 10–24X. I am saying the market cap will. MSTR does a ton of dilutions, so share price growth will always be less than market cap growth. I'm not sure how much dilution will occur, but personally, I think that the upside is too massive to be concerned about this. The last caveat is that most people may not see it this way for a while. I anticipate a lot of pushback against this thesis because it is very unique compared to what is normally said about MSTR, or anything in securities analysis for that matter. The lack of recognition of this economic reality could take a long time to correct. While there is opportunity in that, there are also significant risks. Being early and being wrong is often the same thing in markets. Conclusion I think MSTR is more of a Bitcoin bet than BTC itself. It capitalizes on aspects of Bitcoin that a simple BTC investment cannot do so efficiently. With BTC becoming more mainstream, you will certainly see BTC backed securities, of which MSTR is the core beneficiary. MSTR is monetizing BTC's volatility and its network effect growth.

Solana-based decentralized exchanges register record weekly trading volume that's bigger than the combined activity in Ethereum, Base and BSC.  It's said that the best trades occur when the tape, or the direction of the price trend, aligns perfectly with the fundamentals. The solana-bitcoin (SOL/BTC) ratio appears to be one of those rare cases, showcasing a solid bullish price pattern supported by equally impressive activity on the Solana blockchain.  Price Breakout  The SOL/BTC ratio rose over 1% last week, moving out of a narrowing price range, referred to as triangular consolidation in technical analysis.  The breakout indicates that the bulls are finally willing to lead the price action, having been in a stalemate with the bears for eight months. In other words, a sustained uptrend looks likely.  The Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) histogram, a indicator used to identify trend changes and strength, has crossed above zero, indicating a renewed bullish shift in momentum.  Fundamentals validate breakout  Whether Solana will ultimately replace Ethereum as the top smart contract blockchain remains a hot topic of debate. However, one thing is clear: Solana has established itself as the go-to-place for retail investors to trade memecoins, as evidenced by the surge in trading volumes which supports the bullish outlook for SOL.  Solana-based decentralized exchanges (DEX) have registered cumulative trading volume of $41.6 billion in the seven days to Nov, 17, more than double the preceding week and the highest on record, according to data source Artemis.  The Solana blockchain alone did more volume than Ethereum, Base and BSC's cumulative DEX activity of $37.9 billion, of which Ethereum accounted for $14.3 billion while the rest did over $11 billion each.  Furthermore, Solana continues to compete the rivals in terms of free revenue despite known for being relatively cheaper than Ethereum.

With a price jump of 150% over the last seven days, Hedera's market cap has reached $5.452 billion. HBAR trades at $0.1445 at press time, with a 24-hour surge of 16.17%. Will the bullish trend in HBAR price result in a new 52-week high this November? Let’s analyze the current price trend to determine the next potential target levels. HBAR Price AnalysisOn the daily chart, the HBAR token shows a massive V-shaped reversal rally, inching closer to its 52-week high. Starting from a low of $0.04159 earlier this month, HBAR's bull run has propelled its price by 245% in the last two weeks. The bullish turnaround is challenging the 100% Fibonacci level at $0.1567. The intraday candle shows a potential doji formation following last night's massive 60% surge. Hedera (HBAR) price chart Over the last five days, it has made consecutive bullish candles, accounting for a nearly 150% surge. The bullish momentum has resulted in a positive crossover between the 50-day and 100-day EMA lines. Furthermore, it has increased the chances of a golden crossover between the 50-day and 200-day EMAs. The MACD and signal lines show extremely bullish histograms, supporting the bullish trend and reflecting strong momentum. As a result, the technical indicators are signaling a buy for Hedera.Will Hedera (HBAR) Price Cross $0.25? Speculation about a potential partnership between Hedera Hashgraph and SpaceX’s ambitious blockchain mission is fueling the HBAR/USD rally. As Hedera aims to play a key role in satellite payments, the bullish momentum in HBAR appears to be gaining strength.Based on the Fibonacci levels, the continuation of the uptrend suggests price targets of $0.2249 and $0.355. This represents a potential 145% extension from the current market price.On the other hand, a pullback could see the price retesting $0.1180 or the 78.60% Fibonacci level.",POSITIVE,HBAR,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TRADING | HBAR,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/19/habr-150-weekly-surge-is-hedera-primed-for-the-next-big-breakout/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=habr-150-weekly-surge-is-hedera-primed-for-the-next-big-breakout,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

36565549,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=101961,1732006456,Bitcoin Could Start Rallying Towards $150K in the Next Two Days: Analysis,"Analyst Ali Martinez believes Bitcoin could commence the rally toward $150K within the next two days before a major correction. Bitcoin has been in a holding pattern for the past few days with no significant price movements, unlike the sharp fluctuations seen in previous weeks. Since Bitcoin's peak of $93,500 on November 13, it has struggled to move higher. While it underwent a mild correction, dropping to $86,682, it has since rebounded to $92,600.Over the past six days, Bitcoin has oscillated between $89K and $91K, with no major price changes. In this passive market, participants are both cautious and excited, anticipating either a significant dip or a sharp upward move.Meanwhile, analysts like Ali Martinez are examining historical trends to forecast Bitcoin’s next possible movement.History Suggests Bitcoin Could Reach $138K Before a Major CorrectionIn an update earlier today, Martinez pointed out that during the 2016/2017 bull season, Bitcoin surged 156% past its previous all-time high before the first major correction, which wiped out 39% of its value. Similarly, he noted that in the 2020/2021 cycle, Bitcoin’s value grew by 121% before experiencing a 32% correction that erased some of those gains. Based on these observations, he suggested that Bitcoin could reach at least $138,000 before facing its first major pullback. Bitcoin Bull Breakout Could Happen in Two Days with $150K TargetMeanwhile, in a follow-up post, Martinez stressed that Bitcoin is closely mirroring the pattern of the previous two bull cycles. He previously noted that after Bitcoin reclaimed the $19,700 peak in the last season, it surged 26% before consolidating for a week. The consolidation was followed by a massive price jump to $40,000.Remarkably, in the current case, Bitcoin has surged 26.7% above its March peak of $73,750 and has been consolidating for the past six days since hitting a new peak of $93,500.Accordingly, Martinez believes that , if history is any guide, the market could see another breakout in the next day or two, with a target of around $150,000.Potential Price Targets During Post-Bull CorrectionsNotably, the $150K target aligns with the historical trend of Bitcoin often seeing gains of 100% or more after surpassing previous all-time highs before experiencing a major correction of around 30%. If this scenario plays out, a correction could push Bitcoin back to $105K if it first claims the $150K target or to $96K if the peak is closer to $138K.Meanwhile, Martinez has highlighted the $83K to $85K and $72K to $75K price ranges as potential areas of support in case the market flips from bullish to bearish.https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1856336607604887893",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/19/bitcoin-could-start-rallying-towards-150k-in-the-next-two-days-analysis/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bitcoin-could-start-rallying-towards-150k-in-the-next-two-days-analysis,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

36553818,https://coinpaprika.com/news/nepal-s-crypto-ban-hinders-fraud-victims-from-reporting-scams,1732006100,Nepal's Crypto Ban Hinders Fraud Victims from Reporting Scams,"Nepal's blanket ban on cryptocurrency trading is making it more difficult for victims of fraud to report their cases to authorities, according to a new report by the country's Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). The FIU, which operates under Nepal Rastra Bank, highlighted the challenges faced by victims of crypto-related scams in its Strategic Analysis Report for 2024. The report states that fraudsters are using sophisticated techniques, such as ""smurfing,"" where large transactions are split into smaller ones to avoid detection. These criminals are also turning illicit funds into digital currencies, making it even harder for authorities to trace or seize the assets. The rise in scams targeting individuals with promises of high returns on digital assets has become a major concern. Fraudsters typically lure victims through advertisements that encourage them to deposit money into certain bank or wallet accounts, only for the funds to disappear without a trace. In a country like Nepal, where cryptocurrency investment is illegal, those who fall victim to these scams are often too afraid to report their losses due to the potential legal repercussions. This creates a barrier for law enforcement, which struggles to identify and address fraud in the crypto space. Nepal implemented a ban on cryptocurrency trading and mining in September 2021, and in January 2023, the Nepalese Telecommunications Authority instructed internet service providers to block access to crypto-related websites, including trading platforms. The crackdown on online trading is an attempt to limit exposure to scams that primarily spread through social media and online ads. However, the illegal status of cryptocurrency trading has only made it harder for fraud victims to seek justice, as they fear getting into legal trouble. The FIU has called for more stringent monitoring of cryptocurrency transactions to combat these fraudulent activities. The report also recommended better public education about the risks of digital asset investments, increased cooperation between different government departments, and the creation of a more balanced regulatory framework to help prevent crypto-related fraud in the future. Nepal is not the only country in South Asia to impose strict regulations on digital assets. Along with China, Russia, Iran, and Bangladesh, Nepal has banned all cryptocurrency trading activities. However, other countries in the region have adopted more flexible approaches. For example, India has not banned crypto trading, but it imposes high taxes on profits made from cryptocurrency investments, with no provision to offset losses against taxable gains. In a significant policy shift, Pakistan recently decided to legalize virtual assets, a move that marks a departure from its previous stance against crypto. This change is believed to be primarily aimed at laying the groundwork for a central bank digital currency (CBDC), rather than fully embracing decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin ( BTC ). On the other hand, Bhutan has taken a more positive stance toward crypto. The country has accumulated over $1 billion in Bitcoin, benefiting from the currency's rising value. Bhutan’s pro-crypto approach contrasts with its neighboring nations, which remain more cautious or outright restrictive when it comes to digital assets. In conclusion, Nepal's decision to ban cryptocurrency trading has unintentionally created a barrier for fraud victims, as they hesitate to report scams for fear of legal consequences. As cryptocurrency-related fraud continues to rise, the FIU urges for better regulatory measures and greater awareness to protect citizens from falling victim to scams. Meanwhile, neighboring countries are exploring different approaches, with some embracing the potential of digital currencies, while others maintain a more cautious or restrictive approach.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/nepal-s-crypto-ban-hinders-fraud-victims-from-reporting-scams,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36553818.jpeg

36565548,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=101944,1732005841,Strong XRP Critic Predicts Explosive XRP Push Once 2021 High of $1.96 Clears,"Peter Brandt, a long-term XRP critic, believes the current setup for XRP signals extreme bullishness if it can breach the 2021 peak. XRP recently achieved a major milestone, crossing the $1 mark for the first time in nearly three years. The recent development has triggered optimism among investors and analysts, with most expecting further upside from this point.Surprisingly, Peter Brandt, a renowned trader and vocal critic of XRP, now acknowledges the potential for explosive growth if XRP can break above key levels. His latest analysis suggests a promising setup for XRP, despite his predominantly skeptical stance.XRP’s Coil Pattern The accompanying chart reveals a symmetrical triangle or “coil” pattern which signals tightening price action over an extended period. This structure began forming following XRP’s drop from its all-time high of $3.31 in early 2018. As XRP continued to witness lower highs and higher lows from this level, the triangle formed a descending resistance from the 2018 peak and an ascending support line originating in 2020. This shows consolidation, with diminishing volatility suggesting an impending breakout. XRP 1W Chart | Peter Brandt XRP's recent move above $1 confirms a breakout from the upper boundary of this multi-year triangle. This is a massive event, as XRP cleared its 2023 high of $0.93 during this surge. Following a reclamation of the $1 mark, the altcoin reached a peak of $1.265 on Nov. 16 before retracing slightly. Currently, it trades around $1.11, maintaining its position above the critical psychological level of $1.Data from Brandt’s chart confirms that the 8-week simple moving average (SMA) currently sits at $0.6775, suggesting strong upward momentum. Additionally, XRP is witnessing increasing trading volume during the breakout. This further validates the uptrend potential. In addition, the chart shows lower values in the Average True Range (ATR) and Average Directional Index (ADX), confirming that volatility is contracting at press time, a sign of a potential explosive push.Brandt Expects XRP RallyPeter Brandt called attention to the $1.96 resistance level, which XRP attained in April 2021 during the previous market run. Breaking this level could trigger a massive rally.Using emoticons, Brandt suggested a “rocket-like” move if XRP successfully clears the $1.96 barrier. Nonetheless, the analyst failed to provide any actual price target.Despite his bullish outlook, Brandt clarified that he does not hold or plan to invest in XRP. According to him, he remains loyal to Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL), while also being involved with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) through his Chart Wizards project.",POSITIVE,BTC | SOL | XRP,BTC | MARKET | SOL | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/19/strong-xrp-critic-predicts-explosive-xrp-push-once-2021-high-of-1-96-clears/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=strong-xrp-critic-predicts-explosive-xrp-push-once-2021-high-of-1-96-clears,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

The move comes on the same day the company acquired over $4.6 billion worth of Bitcoin, following a $2 billion purchase made the previous week. This bold strategy reinforces MicroStrategy's commitment to Bitcoin, making it the largest holder of the cryptocurrency in the world. The convertible notes will not pay any interest but will mature into MicroStrategy stock in 2029, making them attractive for investors at a discount. The funds raised will be used to buy more Bitcoin and for other general corporate purposes, according to the company’s press release. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin-first strategy has significantly boosted its stock price, with shares climbing over 460% in the past year and nearly 75% just this month. MicroStrategy’s focus on Bitcoin has proven to be a successful strategy during the bull market, especially as the company continues to buy massive amounts of Bitcoin. Since the launch of this policy, the company’s stock has been performing better than Bitcoin, reaching a 24-year high in October. MicroStrategy has now surpassed all other companies in Bitcoin holdings, cementing its position as the world’s largest Bitcoin investor. This move is part of the company’s ongoing efforts to align its value with Bitcoin’s performance, which has paid off during the current market surge. MicroStrategy’s stock has been soaring due to its massive Bitcoin investments, which have been a key driver behind the company’s growth. The company’s value is now closely tied to Bitcoin, and its performance often mirrors the cryptocurrency's price movements. MicroStrategy’s stock price increase is largely attributed to the post-Trump bull market, which has boosted the value of Bitcoin. As Bitcoin prices have risen, so too has the value of MicroStrategy, making its Bitcoin-focused strategy an attractive one for investors. Despite some uncertainties around the exact terms of the offering, MicroStrategy is positioning itself to continue expanding its Bitcoin reserves. The company’s stock performance has outpaced Bitcoin, showing that its Bitcoin-first policy is working. But there are concerns about the sustainability of such massive purchases. With a limited supply of Bitcoin available and the growing number of ETF issuers surpassing miners' production levels, the market may not be able to keep up with such a high level of demand forever. MicroStrategy’s aggressive approach to acquiring Bitcoin is bold, but the company has not yet indicated a clear limit to its purchases. While these massive Bitcoin purchases are not sustainable indefinitely, the company is capitalizing on the current bull market. Saylor has even scheduled a webinar to discuss the offering with institutional buyers, indicating that MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin appetite is far from over. The company plans to continue its Bitcoin buying spree as long as the market remains favorable, but with Bitcoin supply dwindling, it is unclear how long this buying frenzy can last. In conclusion, MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy is making it the largest holder of the cryptocurrency in the world. With its stock price soaring, the company is reaping the rewards of its Bitcoin-first policy. However, with the limited supply of Bitcoin and the growing competition from ETF issuers, it remains to be seen how long this strategy will continue to pay off. As long as the bull market persists, MicroStrategy will likely continue to buy Bitcoin, but the long-term sustainability of this approach remains uncertain.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | SPONSORED | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/microstrategy-raises-1-75-billion-in-private-note-sale-to-buy-more-bitcoin,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36553552.jpeg

Meanwhile, Trump is also engaging in talks with Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong regarding key pro-crypto appointments for his upcoming administration. Trump’s potential acquisition of Bakkt has attracted attention, especially since the exchange’s stock has surged following these discussions. Although Bakkt once held a prominent position in the cryptocurrency industry, its influence had declined in recent years, and the company had even considered selling or splitting up. However, with Trump Media exploring the acquisition, Bakkt's stock has seen a dramatic spike. Trump has long been an advocate for crypto-friendly policies, and a purchase of Bakkt could mark a renewed focus on the digital asset space, especially as his presidential term continues to influence policy discussions. Beyond the Bakkt deal, Trump and Armstrong are reportedly discussing potential appointments for key positions in the U.S. government. Armstrong, who has long been an advocate for pro-crypto policies, has expressed strong support for certain figures to take up prominent roles. One key figure he has suggested is SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, widely known in the crypto community as “Crypto Mom.” Armstrong has praised Peirce for her intelligence, fairness, and ability to work across political divides, making her a strong contender for the role of SEC Chair, especially with the likely removal of Gary Gensler. Hester Peirce is one of the five sitting commissioners at the SEC , with two of them having been appointed by Trump. If Armstrong's suggestions are taken seriously, the discussions could significantly influence Peirce’s chances of becoming the next head of the SEC. The position has become more important as crypto markets anticipate changes in the regulatory environment under a potential new SEC leadership. Throughout the election cycle, Coinbase had invested heavily in supporting pro-crypto candidates, including those who aligned with Trump’s vision of more crypto-friendly regulations. Since Trump's election, Armstrong has been vocal about the need for a regulatory framework that fosters innovation while balancing investor protection. His remarks regarding Peirce as a potential SEC Chair come at a time when speculation about Gensler's future is high. Armstrong’s backing could play a crucial role in shaping the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the United States. Trump's growing influence in the crypto space through his media company and policy discussions with Armstrong signals a shift toward more crypto-friendly government policies. The talks about acquiring Bakkt and the potential appointment of Hester Peirce could mark a turning point in how the U.S. approaches digital currencies, with more emphasis on fostering innovation rather than imposing restrictive regulations. As both a businessman and a former president, Trump’s moves could bridge the gap between the government and the crypto industry, creating opportunities for further growth in the sector. In summary, Trump Media’s discussions to acquire Bakkt and Trump’s talks with Brian Armstrong about crypto-friendly appointments point to a rising pro-crypto sentiment in the U.S. The backing of figures like Hester Peirce for SEC leadership shows a shift toward a regulatory environment that might be more conducive to the growth of cryptocurrencies. With Bakkt’s stock price rising and key political figures advocating for change, the future of the cryptocurrency market looks poised for a more favorable regulatory climate.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/trump-in-talks-to-buy-bakkt-discusses-pro-crypto-appointments-with-coinbase-ceo,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36553282.jpeg

36552814,https://coinpaprika.com/news/tudor-investment-boosts-bitcoin-etf-stake,1732004452,Tudor Investment Boosts Bitcoin ETF Stake,"Tudor Investment Corp, led by hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones, has significantly increased its investment in Bitcoin. According to a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), the firm now holds over 4.4 million shares in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, a large increase from the 869,565 shares it owned in June 2024. This increase highlights Tudor’s growing confidence in Bitcoin as the price of the cryptocurrency continues to rise. As of the end of September 2024, Tudor’s Bitcoin ETF investment is worth approximately $230 million, up from $160 million in June. This 400% growth in holdings reflects both the firm’s purchase of additional shares and Bitcoin’s ongoing bull market. Paul Tudor Jones has long supported Bitcoin as an essential hedge against inflation, and this move demonstrates his belief in the cryptocurrency’s ability to preserve wealth in uncertain economic times. Jones has previously expressed his positive view on Bitcoin, emphasizing its role as a valuable asset during inflationary periods. The increase in Tudor Investment’s Bitcoin ( BTC ) holdings aligns with a growing trend of institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs. These funds allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin through a regulated product, which is attractive to institutional investors. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has played a significant role in promoting institutional acceptance of cryptocurrencies, with its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF providing a more traditional way for investors to access Bitcoin. Institutional participation in Bitcoin is steadily rising, and the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. is seen as a key development. Spot Bitcoin ETFs would make it easier for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin, further opening the door for institutional money to flow into the cryptocurrency market. As regulatory frameworks around digital assets improve, these funds could become a major way for institutional investors to get involved. Alongside Tudor’s investment, other institutions are making moves into the Bitcoin market. On November 18, 2024, MARA Holdings announced a $700 million investment in convertible notes to fuel its Bitcoin reserves. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy, a well-known Bitcoin investor, purchased another $4.6 billion worth of Bitcoin. These developments reflect a growing trend of large institutions increasing their Bitcoin holdings as they see the potential for long-term gains. Tudor’s decision to quadruple its Bitcoin ETF stake signals its belief that the cryptocurrency market will continue to grow. This move is a clear sign that institutional interest in Bitcoin is building, as many investors see the cryptocurrency as a hedge against inflation and a strong store of value. With increasing optimism around the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which would make it easier for traditional investors to access Bitcoin, more institutional players are likely to follow suit. As the regulatory landscape becomes clearer and institutional adoption increases, investments like Tudor Investment’s could play a major role in bridging traditional finance and the digital asset world. The approval of Bitcoin ETFs could open the floodgates for more institutions to enter the market, further increasing demand and driving up the price of Bitcoin. These developments point to a promising future for Bitcoin as a mainstream financial asset, with investors seeing it as a safe bet during periods of economic uncertainty. In conclusion, Tudor Investment Corp’s decision to increase its stake in BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF by a significant amount reflects growing institutional confidence in Bitcoin. The firm’s move is part of a broader trend, with institutional players continuing to show interest in the cryptocurrency market. As more investors see the value of Bitcoin, and with spot Bitcoin ETFs potentially gaining approval, the cryptocurrency market is poised for even greater growth. These developments suggest that Bitcoin’s position as a hedge against inflation and a store of value will only strengthen in the coming years.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/tudor-investment-boosts-bitcoin-etf-stake,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36552814.jpeg

36552537,https://coinpaprika.com/news/lawmakers-push-treasury-to-crack-down-on-tornado-cash,1732004021,Lawmakers Push Treasury to Crack Down on Tornado Cash,"US lawmakers are urging the U.S. Treasury Department to focus more on crypto mixers, particularly Tornado Cash, which has been involved in laundering large sums of illicit funds. Tornado Cash, a decentralized platform, has faced legal issues after its co-founders were accused of facilitating billions in money laundering. Rep. Sean Casten from Illinois, along with five other Democratic lawmakers, sent a letter to the Treasury Department last week calling for more investigation into the platform. The letter highlights the case of Roman Storm, one of the co-founders, who allegedly used illicit money to buy assets, including properties worth $3.1 million and a Tesla SUV. In the letter, lawmakers criticized Storm's actions, pointing out that he admitted to the platform’s lack of security measures, which allowed users to bypass sanctions. Despite being sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury in 2022, Tornado Cash continues to operate, raising concerns about its role in illegal activities. Lawmakers also pointed to incidents like the Ronin Network hack , which involved Tornado Cash. Storm’s case is particularly concerning because it shows how easy it is for hackers to launder stolen money through Tornado Cash. After the platform was sanctioned by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which banned U.S. individuals and businesses from using it, the developers of Tornado Cash attempted to block deposits from sanctioned addresses. However, Storm admitted in an encrypted message that these measures were easy to bypass without proper Anti-Money Laundering (AML) or Know Your Customer (KYC) processes. In 2022, OFAC added Tornado Cash to its list of sanctioned entities, but this decision sparked controversy, especially within the crypto community. Critics argued that it was unfair to sanction software like Tornado Cash, which is not a person or organization. Despite this, Tornado Cash remains a significant concern, as it continues to be used for illegal activities. Legal proceedings against Tornado Cash and its developers are ongoing. In May, Dutch authorities sentenced developer Alexi Pertsev to five years in prison for laundering $2.2 billion using the platform. He is currently raising funds for his legal defense, with estimates for the cost of his case ranging from $750,000 to $1 million. Meanwhile, Roman Storm, whose trial was delayed from December to April, is also seeking crowdfunding to cover his legal costs, which could reach $500,000 per month. Privacy advocate Edward Snowden showed his support for Storm , saying that “privacy is not a crime.” Despite the sanctions, Tornado Cash remains a popular tool for hackers. In September, criminals laundered $50 million through the platform, which was connected to breaches at crypto projects like Penpie and the Indian exchange WazirX. Additionally, hackers linked to thefts at Poloniex and Kronos Research laundered over $7.3 million through Tornado Cash earlier this year. The continued misuse of Tornado Cash in high-profile cybercrimes has intensified calls for stricter regulation of crypto mixers. U.S. lawmakers are pushing for stronger measures to curb the platform’s use in illegal activities, but the debate over how to regulate decentralized technology like Tornado Cash is far from over. As the legal battles unfold, the future of Tornado Cash and its role in money laundering remains uncertain.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/lawmakers-push-treasury-to-crack-down-on-tornado-cash,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36552537.jpeg

36551981,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653737,1732003252,"Bitcoin ‘Parabolic Phase Just Begun’, Is BTC Hitting $100,000 This Week?","Bitcoin (BTC) started the week by breaking out of a bullish pattern after moving sideways for most of the weekend. The flagship cryptocurrency just started its “parabolic phase,” sitting 3.4% below its all-time high (ATH), which could bring “massive moves” for BTC this week. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Ready To Roar! Analyst Calls For A 200% Spike Bitcoin ‘Parabolic Phase’ Just Started Bitcoin has seen a massive surge in the last two weeks, jumping 32% to the $89,000-$90,000 price range. BTC’s remarkable performance saw it soar 11% last Monday, preparing the ground for its eventual surge toward its latest ATH of $93,400 two days later. Since then, Bitcoin’s price has hovered between the $89,000-$92,000 range, briefly falling to $87,000 last Friday. Over the weekend, the flagship crypto continued to move within this rage, registering its largest weekly close in Bitcoin history. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital pointed out that BTC is barely starting its “parabolic phase,” noting that week three of the cycle’s “first price discovery uptrend” started today. The analyst explained that, historically, BTC has seen around 300 days of parabolic run each cycle, with the first major pullback coming over a month after entering price discovery mode. Per the post, it took six weeks before the flagship crypto’s first major pullback in 2013. In 2017, BTC rallied for eight weeks before registering a deeper pullback. Meanwhile, it soared for four weeks before experiencing a major retrace in the 2020-2021 cycle. Based on this, the analyst considers that “history suggests there’s more upside to come and that the first Price Discovery Correction is still weeks away.” Is A Move Massive Move Coming This Week? Ali Martinez noted that Bitcoin seems to be repeating 2020’s pattern. In 2020, after breaking its previous ATH of $19,700, BTC rose 26% and consolidated for a week. Following its consolidation, BTC jumped 66% toward $40,000 in the next two weeks. Martinez pointed out that Bitcoin has risen 28% since surpassing its March ATH and has been consolidating for nearly a week. This suggests that the cryptocurrency’s price could be getting ready for a substantial surge in the following days, potentially hitting the $100,000 mark this week. Crypto Yapper, another market watcher, stated that Bitcoin will likely make a “massive move” soon. The analyst highlighted the flagship crypto’s consolidation, noting the significant price action around the $89,000-$90,000 mark. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Aren’t Backing Down: Rally Continues? This horizontal level acted as a key resistance zone earlier last week but has been confirmed as support throughout the past five days. As Bitcoin retested the $91,000 earlier today, the analyst also pointed out its price could continue the bullish trajectory and aim for a new ATH around $95,000. Additionally, BTC started the week breaking out of a one-week symmetrical triangle pattern. To Crypto Yapper, this is a “typical continuation pattern” for the cryptocurrency, which suggests that Bitcoin is set to continue its climb if the breakout is confirmed throughout the day. The analyst stated that BTC’s continuation of its uptrend could hit $100,000 by Sunday. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $90,260, a 10% increase in the weekly timeframe.

The move comes weeks before EU's MiCA regulations allow registered companies to expand across the trading bloc.  Gemini crypto exchange opened up to users in France just weeks before the European Union's Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations kick in, paving the way for an expansion across the 27-nation trading bloc.  Users, including institutions, in the EU's second-largest economy are now able to open a Gemini account to deposit, trade and store digital assets, the New York-based company founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss said Tuesday. They will be able to add funds using debit cards and bank transfers.  The move paves the way for growth in other EU countries after MiCA takes full effect at the end of the year. (Rules relating to stablecoin issues came into force in June.) Next year, companies with MiCA approval in one country will be allowed to operate across the bloc. While they're waiting for approval, companies registered in an EU member country will be able to operate in the country of registration for a specified period of time. For France-registered firms, that's 18 months.  ""Gemini’s research into the French market shows its growing interest in digital assets, and a robust regulatory framework presents a unique opportunity to introduce our platform to the trading community and extend our presence in the European market over the coming months,” Gillian Lynch, Gemini’s CEO of U.K. and Europe, said in a statement.

42435307,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kotje,1731999693,Donald Trump’s Media Group Eyes Purchase of Crypto Exchange Bakkt: Report,"Trump's media company is expanding into the cryptocurrency market.  Bakkt's crypto custody business will not be part of the acquisition.  The deal deepens Trump's involvement in crypto after promoting World Liberty Financial.  Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), the parent company of Truth Social, is in advanced discussions to acquire the crypto trading platform Bakkt, according to a report from the Financial Times.  The potential all-stock deal would see TMTG absorb Bakkt, whose market capitalization stood at just over $150 million on Monday. TMTG, despite minimal revenue, boasts a $6 billion equity valuation fueled by retail investor interest following Trump’s re-election.  Bakkt was set up by Intercontinental Exchange, which owns large derivatives exchanges, plus the NYSE, with the initial goal of helping Starbucks customers buy coffee with bitcoin {{BTC}}.  Future U.S. Senator Kelly Loeffler was its first CEO. It finally introduced a digital wallet in 2021, which was discontinued last year. Bakkt is now focused on crypto custody and trading services. In February, Bakkt said it did not have cash in hand to fund even 12 months of the operation.  Shares of Bakkt Holdings Inc (BKKT) ended up jumping 160% on Monday following the report.  Talks of the acquisition follow Trump’s recent promotion of World Liberty Financial, a DeFi platform tied to the Trump family. A deal could impact Bakkt's future direction and potential role within Trump's expanding media empire, including its focus on bitcoin.  As such, Bakkt’s crypto custody business, which holds digital assets like bitcoin and ether, has struggled and will be excluded from the acquisition. The move comes amid a surge in crypto markets following Trump's victory, with bitcoin up over 30% in the past 30 days.

42435312,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kotp4,1731999162,Ethereum's Ether Has Fallen Out of Investor Favor and How,"ETH's options-based probability density function shows just a 10% chance of prices testing the year-to-date high of $4,000 by the end of December.  ETH faces headwinds from weak fundamentals.  Ethereum's ether {{ETH}}, once viewed as the shiny silver to bitcoin's {{BTC}} gold, has only risen 36% this year, significantly trailing behind BTC's impressive 109% surge.  Such is the investor aversion toward ETH that, at the going market rate of $3,100, the cryptocurrency is still well below the record price of $4,832 in 2021, while BTC trades at lifetime highs above $90,000.  The underperformance, which makes ETH feel more like palladium struggling to keep pace with gold, is expected to continue well into the year's end, as new research by Amberdata shows only a 10% chance of ether topping the first quarter high of around $4,000 while traders bet on BTC setting new highs above $100,000.  The chart shows the probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF), highlighting the probability of ether trading at various price levels over several time frames. The graphic is derived from ether options trading on the dominant crypto options exchange Deribit.  A taller peak at a certain price indicates a greater probability of prices reaching that level and vice versa.  At press time, traders assigned just a 10% probability of ether topping the $4,000 mark by the Dec. 27 expiry. It's a sign that the expected regulatory shift away from enforcement actions against decentralized finance and other crypto sectors under Trump's presidency is yet to galvanize investor interest in ETH, even though it has done so for the so-called DeFi coins.  Amberdata attributes ETH's dour outlook to weak fundamentals.  ""ETH faces serious headwinds as the value proposition of “sound money” (aka deflationary supply due to transaction fee burn) has flipped to inflation supply as nearly all DeFi transactions are being executed on L2s as opposed to ETH L1 itself. I believe that’s drastically dragging prices down,"" Amberdata's Director of Derivatives Greg Magadini said in a newsletter to clients.  Last week, at the Ethereum community's biennial Devon gathering, influential researcher Justin Drake proposed an ambitious overhaul of the oldest smart contract blockchain. Among other things, the Beam Chain proposal would cut block times to four seconds from the current 12, which would allow for more blocks, therefore more transactions to be processed. Those improvements, in theory, could lead to more transactions being conducted on the main Ethereum chain rather than auxiliary layer-twos, which in turn might conceivably mitigate the supply issue identified by Magadini. However, Beam Chain could take years to see the light of day, if it does at all.  Irrespective of Ethereum's fundamentals, however, a potential acceleration in bitcoin's uptrend could eventually drag ETH above $4,000, while maintaining its underperformance relative to BTC.

42415491,V83uyxCwmh6ufrmZyOJgRT,1731998541,"Bitcoin at $100K No Longer a Dream Believe Traders, but Blow-Off Top Warning in Near Term","The potential for $100,000 bitcoin has been fueled by anticipated U.S. regulatory changes and strong institutional adoption.  There are expectations of an altcoin season following a decrease in Bitcoin's market dominance.  Despite the bullish outlook, concerns about overvaluation and potential market corrections persist.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} reaching the mythical $100,000 figure seemed a lofty target as recently as a few months ago, as the asset spent months in a narrow range under $65,000. But the promise of swiftly changing U.S. regulations has revived the dream.  “Predictions of BTC at 100K aren't a pipedream anymore as the political and institutional stars start to align,” traders at Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a Telegram broadcast Tuesday. “Despite having net ETF outflows last Thursday and Friday, BTC still looks relatively well supported and institutional adoption remains strong.”  The bull run has led to notable bitcoin backers MicroStrategy (MSTR) and Metaplanet announcing fresh BTC purchases on Monday, with the former now holding 1.5% of the asset’s total supply.  QCP expect a run to $100,000 — nearly 10% higher than the current record of over $93,000 — in the coming months, with those gains flowing into altcoins in a mark of a general “alt season.”  “BTC's dominance is around 60% now and will probably need to be under 58% to signal the start of altcoin season. We anticipate pro-crypto policies from the Trump administration and more rate cuts. We won't be surprised to see altcoin season in full swing in the coming months,” QCP said.  Banks and traditional finance analysts have issued targets as high as $200,000 after Republican Donald Trump’s victory in the November elections.  A retail sentiment by U.S. bank JPMorgan rose to a record high of 4 earlier this week, indicative of renewed demand from smaller professional investors. The measure is designed to gauge the sentiment of retail investors toward cryptocurrencies, especially bitcoin, based on the activity in the family of BTC products, including spot ETFs.  However, not all are bright and optimistic, as near-term concerns remain.  “We feel that the 'easy' part of the rally has been done and the next stage will be much trickier with more price choppiness and potential for drawdowns,” Augustine Fan, head of insights at SOFA, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “Bitcoin dominance remains on a one-way trend higher reminiscent of the mega-cap dominance in SPX, and is not particularly desirable for this stage of the crypto ecosystem.”  “We'll be looking for a potential blow-off top in the near term with market sentiment at highly frothy levels,” Fan added.  A blow-off top is a chart pattern recognized in technical analysis that indicates a rapid and steep increase in the price of an asset, followed by an equally rapid decline.  In case of a blow off top, the former record high of around $69,000 could be tested again, with a classic bear market wick potentially extending up to lower $60,000, said CoinDesk's senior markets analyst Omkar Godbole.  Maksym Sakharov, co-founder of WeFi, mirrors the sentiment. ""The upside volatility in the price of Bitcoin has slowed down since it crossed the $90,000 ATH range. The fact that the US Federal Reserve is no longer in a rush to cut interest rates moving forward has further forced investors to re-evaluate their bets on Bitcoin,” Sakharov said.  “Should the Fed continue to adopt a mildly hawkish stance toward the rate, the attractiveness of Bitcoin may decrease,” Sakharov added.",POSITIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/19/bitcoin-at-100k-no-longer-a-dream-believe-traders-but-blow-off-top-warning-in-near-term,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f9b1cdaf5d098cf7af61739ec24a53c5e3c3816f-1244x700.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

36548502,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653742,1731997826,"Bitcoin’s Market Is Still In An ‘Healthy Growth’ Phase, Says Analyst—Here’s Why","Last week, Bitcoin saw consistent upward momentum, leading to the asset breaching multiple resistances to achieve a peak of $93,477 finally. However, ever since, BTC has seen a price decrease and appears to maintain stability above $90,000 while showing signs of controlled market sentiment. Amid this price performance, a CryptoQuant analyst known as G a a h recently shared his perspective on Bitcoin’s current market behavior, focusing on an important metric such as the Short-Term Holders Spent Output Profit Ratio (STH SOPR) to reveal whether the asset still has more room for growth. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Hit 5-Year Low—What Does This Signal? What The STH SOPR Metric Suggest For Bitcoin The Short-Term Holders Spent Output Profit Ratio metric, which tracks the profitability of Bitcoin held by short-term holders, has revealed a trend of moderate optimism in the market, according to G a a h. The analyst elaborated that unlike past cycles marked by euphoric price spikes, the STH SOPR remains within a “middle region,” far from indicating extreme greed. This suggests that while some investors are taking profits, the current market environment remains stable, with room for further upward movement. The relationship between the SOPR indicator and Bitcoin’s 30-day moving average further emphasizes this point. According to the CryptoQuant analyst, short-term holders take measured profits without overwhelming the market with sell pressure, signaling “healthy growth.” Historical data shows that when the SOPR enters the extreme greed range, Bitcoin often encounters significant market resistance, leading to corrections. Conversely, accumulation tends to occur when the indicator reflects extreme fear, often marking key price bottoms. The analyst’s observations suggest that Bitcoin remains in a transitional growth phase, with investors carefully adjusting their positions as the price trends upward. G a a h wrote: At the moment, the behavior of the SOPR suggests a phase of healthy growth, with moderate optimism. This intermediate position may reflect a market in transition, where investors continue to adjust their positions as the Bitcoin price advances. Key Indicators to Watch in Bitcoin’s Market Behaviour While the SOPR currently suggests a balanced market, as reported by the analyst, he also advised investors to monitor the movements of the indicator closely in the coming weeks. The analyst noted: If it quickly approaches the extreme greed range, it could be a sign of more aggressive profit-taking and a possible trend reversal. G a a h also added that this phase of moderate optimism, if sustained, could create opportunities for continued upside potential, but risk management remains a crucial aspect of navigating this market environment. Related Reading: Binance Dominates As Bitcoin Futures Volume Hits New Peaks Amid Historic Price Rally The CryptoQuant analyst concluded: While the SOPR indicates that the top has not yet been reached, the balance between optimism and caution is key to maximizing gains and protecting capital from high price volatility.

Metaplanet To Increase BTC Holdings Through Bond Issuance The Tokyo-listed company announced on November 18 that its Board of Directors had approved a debt sale with a guarantee worth 1.75 billion yen, or approximately $11.5 million. The bonds will have a one-year maturity period, maturing on November 17, 2025, and will carry an interest rate of 0.36% per annum. Related Reading: MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Bet Pays Off In Multiple Ways As Stock Surges 317% The proceeds from the bond issuance will be used solely to purchase BTC. It’s worth noting that Metaplanet already holds 1,018 BTC on its balance sheet. Often referred to as “Asia’s MicroStrategy,” Metaplanet’s latest BTC acquisition announcement comes just a week after the US-based business intelligence firm MicroStrategy purchased 27,200 BTC, worth approximately $2.03 billion at current market prices. Metaplanet began acquiring BTC as a strategic treasury reserve asset in April. The company announced it was adopting a “Bitcoin-first, Bitcoin-only” approach, mirroring MicroStrategy’s BTC investment strategy. Since April, the early-stage investment firm has steadily expanded its Bitcoin portfolio. For instance, the company acquired an additional 20.195 BTC in June, worth roughly $1.2 million. It added another 38.464 BTC in September, valued at approximately $2 million. Most recently, in October, the firm announced it had purchased 156.78 BTC, bringing its total holdings to over 1,000 BTC. Despite the announcement of the bond issuance, Metaplanet’s share price saw little movement. The firm’s share closed the day with a modest 0.81% increase on Monday. However, since the company began its Bitcoin acquisition strategy, its stock has experienced explosive growth. On April 4, 2024, Metaplanet’s shares traded at 190 yen ($1.23). Today, they trade at 1,994 yen ($12.86), reflecting gains of nearly 950% in just over seven months. Bitcoin Supply Scarcity To Further Propel Price? With increasing retail, institutional, and even sovereign demand, Bitcoin’s limited supply could lead to a supply shock, potentially driving the digital asset’s price to unprecedented levels. As a reminder, BTC’s total supply is capped at 21 million by design. Related Reading: Bitcoin Continues To Exit Exchanges As Supply Drops To New 2024 Low According to a recent analysis by a CryptoQuant analyst, BTC reserves on cryptocurrency trading platforms have fallen to a five-year low. The analyst also noted that more investors hold Bitcoin long-term as a hedge against rising inflation and currency debasement. Similarly, a recent report suggests that BTC demand vastly exceeds its supply. This growing supply-demand imbalance may set the stage for Bitcoin’s next major price breakout. BTC trades at $90,909 at press time, up 0.1% in the past 24 hours. Featured image from Unsplash, Charts from Yahoo!

Optimistic Bitcoin Price Outlook In a recent appearance on CNBC’s Squawk Box, Lee discussed the implications of the political landscape following Donald Trump’s victory over Kamala Harris in the presidential election, suggesting that Bitcoin could play a pivotal role in the upcoming administration. Lee articulated that Bitcoin could serve as a solution to some of the United States’ fiscal challenges, particularly if it is designated as a national reserve asset—a promise made by Trump earlier this year at the National Bitcoin Conference in Nashville. Related Reading: Trump Social Media Firm In Talks To Expand Into Crypto With Bakkt Acquisition The Fundstrat executive also highlighted Bitcoin’s robust security features and its underlying blockchain technology, arguing that these elements position it as a viable alternative to some existing financial structures. Lee believes that Bitcoin’s attributes could address several issues inherent in the current economic framework, further boosting its appeal among investors. When discussing his price forecast, Lee expressed confidence, stating, “I think comfortably over $100,000 makes sense before the end of the year.” Lee noted that the current Bitcoin price trajectory is consistent with historical patterns observed during previous Halving cycles, events that typically reduce the rate at which new BTC are created and ultimately have a positive impact on price action. Key Support Levels Identified Crypto analyst Ali Martinez also provided insights into the current Bitcoin price price dynamics, but drawing parallels with historical market behavior. He noted that during the 2017 bull market, Bitcoin surged by 156% beyond its previous all-time high before experiencing a significant correction of -39%. Similarly, in 2020, Bitcoin rose 121% prior to a -32% pullback. Based on these patterns, Martinez suggests that Bitcoin could potentially reach at least $138,000 before facing its first major correction. Further analyzing past trends, Martinez pointed out that after Bitcoin broke its previous all-time high of $19,700 in 2020, it initially surged by 26%, consolidated for about a week, and then jumped to $40,000. Currently, Bitcoin has increased by 28% after surpassing its previous all-time high and has been consolidating for the past six days, leading Martinez to speculate that history might be repeating itself. However, he also cautioned that Bitcoin could be on the verge of a steep correction. He highlighted a growing sense of greed among crypto enthusiasts as evidenced by a notable spike in Google search interest for Bitcoin, reflected in the profits realized by investors, who have collectively taken home over $5.42 billion. Related Reading: MicroStrategy Makes Record $4.6 Billion Bitcoin Purchase, Largest Yet From a technical analysis standpoint, Martinez flagged the TD Sequential indicator, which has presented a sell signal on Bitcoin’s daily chart. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests that Bitcoin is currently in overbought territory, signaling potential for a price pullback. In the event of a correction, Martinez identified key support levels to monitor, specifically between $85,800 and $83,250, as well as further down at $75,520 to $72,880. The analyst emphasized that for a bullish outlook to remain intact, the Bitcoin price needs to maintain a sustained daily close above $91,900. Such a close could invalidate the bearish sentiment and potentially trigger a breakout toward a target of $100,680. As of this writing, the leading digital asset is trading at $90,970, up nearly 2% in the 24-hour time frame.

It outperformed Bitcoin and Ethereum with a move above the $1.050 and $1.080 resistance levels. The price climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1.2745 swing high to the $0.9988 low. The bulls even pushed the price above the $1.150 resistance level before the bears appeared. It seems like the price faced resistance near $1.170. The 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1.2745 swing high to the $0.9988 low is acting as a hurdle. However, there is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $1.100 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading above $1.080 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1.1680 level. The first major resistance is near the $1.200 level. The next key resistance could be $1.2740. A clear move above the $1.2740 resistance might send the price toward the $1.3220 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $1.3500 resistance or even $1.3620 in the near term. The next major hurdle might be $1.450. Are Dips Supported? If XRP fails to clear the $1.1680 resistance zone, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $1.100 level and the trend line. The next major support is near the $1.060 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $1.060 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $1.000 support in the near term. The next major support sits near the $0.980 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level.

This Model Says So","The CryptoQuant founder has shared a model for Bitcoin that suggests the cryptocurrency’s maximum price could lie around $135,000 right now. Bitcoin Model Established On Realized Cap Could Reveal Price Ceiling & Floor In a new post on X, CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju has discussed about a BTC pricing model that’s based on the Realized Cap. The “Realized Cap” here refers to an on-chain valuation model for Bitcoin that assumes the ‘real’ value of any coin in circulation is the price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Down 7%, But Whales Continue To Buy For any token, its last transfer is likely to represent the last instance of it changing hands, so the price at its time could be considered as the token’s current cost basis. As such, the Realized Cap is a sum of the cost basis of all coins on the network. Put another way, the Realized Cap measures the total amount of capital that the holders of the cryptocurrency as a whole have invested into it. A new metric can be derived from this indicator by dividing it by the total circulating supply, representing the cost basis for the average token or investor on the chain. This indicator is known as the Realized Price. In the context of the current topic, the Realized Price itself isn’t of interest, but its two multipliers are: 3.9x and 0.75x. Below is the chart shared by Young Ju that shows the trend in these two multipliers of the Realized Price over the history of Bitcoin. In the graph, the CryptoQuant founder has marked the 3.9x multiplier of the Realized Price as BTC’s “ceiling price.” Similarly, the 0.75x multiplier represents the “floor price.” An inspection of the trend in the indicator during the past cycles reveals why the analyst has chosen to do so. It turns out that the asset has generally topped at or slightly above the 3.9x multiplier, while it has reached bottoms at or slightly under the 0.75x multiplier. At present, the ceiling price for the asset is sitting at a value of around $135,741, while the floor price at $26,104. Bitcoin is much higher than the latter right now, but there is also an appreciable distance to the former. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Is Finally Back: These Metrics Point To An Explosion In Interest This means that at the current amount of capital invested into the cryptocurrency, it still has room for growth, at least going by the pattern observed throughout history. Naturally, the ceiling price isn’t something that’s certain to remain where it is now for the rest of the bull run, since any further fresh capital inflows into the asset would raise it. But for now, under $136,000 is looking like Bitcoin’s upper limit. BTC Price The Bitcoin rally has hit a pause button recently as the coin’s value is still trading around $90,000 right now.

36538251,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653663,1731981659,"Dogecoin Large Transactions Surge 41% With 35% Uptick In Daily Addresses, Will Price Follow?","Dogecoin has seen a significant uptick in activity over the past few hours as its price begins to rebound following a correction over the weekend. Over the last 24 hours, there has been a notable increase in the number of large DOGE transactions being moved across Dogecoin wallets. These large Dogecoin transactions, typically involving amounts greater than $100,000, are often regarded as an important indicator of a whale or institutional involvement in the market. Although the Dogecoin large transactions could as much be selloffs as they were accumulations, the sheer surge in activity shows a positive trend for the meme coin. Dogecoin Large Transaction Activity Intensifies The recent Dogecoin rally appears to be losing steam following an impressive surge that pushed its price above $0.42 for the first time since the 2021 bull market. A seeming profit-taking trend among traders that rode through the price rally has led to a pullback, bringing the Dogecoin price back below the $0.40 threshold. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is currently trading below $0.40, having corrected to a $0.346 low in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: XRP Price Rockets Past $1: On-Chain Data Unveils Key Holder Cohort Behind Breakout The correction has brought about the idea that maybe the Dogecoin price has finally expanded its sentiment among crypto investors. However, on-chain data suggests this might not be the case. Despite the price correction, the Dogecoin blockchain continued to witness a surge in activity. According to data from analytics platform IntoTheBlock, Dogecoin recorded $23.35 billion in Dogecoin’s large transaction volume over the past 24 hours, representing a notable 41.12% increase compared to the previous day. In addition, the blockchain registered 157,190 active addresses during the same period, marking a 34.91% rise. What Does This Mean For DOGE Price? These metrics highlight sustained interest in Dogecoin, even amid its price correction. The sharp increase in Dogecoin’s large transaction volume and active addresses suggests that traders, particularly large holders, remain engaged with the meme coin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Golden Multiplier Ratio: Analyst Says The Party Is Just Getting Started This renewed interest appears to have translated into increased buying pressure, as evidenced by a concurrent price uptick in the past 24 hours. DOGE has risen by approximately 4% during the past 24 hours and is now up 7.4% from its weekend low. Adding to the bullish sentiment, crypto analyst Captain Faibik has pointed out that the Dogecoin price is on the verge of breaking above the upper trendline of a falling wedge pattern. This falling wedge formation has been developing since DOGE’s price peaked at a three-year high of $0.4265 on November 14 and began consolidating. Based on this technical analysis, Captain Faibik predicts that a breakout from the wedge could trigger another rally, pushing Dogecoin’s price up by 25% to reach $0.47 At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at $0.38.

36534641,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653716,1731976217,XRP Mania On The Rise: ATH Predictions Backed By Solid Google Search Interest,"Recently, XRP has gained immense attention in the cryptocurrency world. Its price recently touched new highs and attracted unparalleled public interest. According to Google Trends, search interest for XRP surged on November 16 up to a perfect score of 100. Related Reading: XRP Breaks $1 — Is The Garlinghouse-Trump Connection Fueling The Rise? This significant increase occurred mere days after interest had been stagnant at a measly 8, illustrating the rapidity with which sentiment can fluctuate in the cryptocurrency sector. A Remarkable Increase In Price The increase in search interest is in ideal harmony with the price performance of the coin. The altcoin was trading at approximately $0.77 on November 15, but it had risen to $1.27 by the following day, a remarkable 64% increase in just 24 hours. The current price of XRP is the highest it has been in three years, and many investors are enthusiastic about its potential to attain even greater heights. The most recent instance of a significant increase in interest in the crypto occurred in April 2021, when it reached a high of $1.96. Given the tumultuous history of XRP over the past few years, this recent rally is of particular importance. Now that it has regained its traction, the stagnation period and challenges it experienced have come to an end, and the price levels of the coin are hovering around the $0.40 dollar levels. Analysts are upbeat about its future, noting that the cryptocurrency remains well below its all-time high of $3.84, leaving ample room for potential growth. Factors Contributing To The Increase Newfound enthusiasm for XRP is being driven by a variety of factors. One significant factor is the accumulation of the digital asset by large investors, who are frequently referred to as “whales.” According to reports, these investors have recently invested more than $526 million in XRP, indicating their strong confidence in the cryptocurrency’s future potential. Additionally, the recent increase in open interest for XRP futures indicates that traders are anticipating additional volatility and price fluctuations. The demand for XRP is on the rise as more retail investors become involved in the coin’s promise, motivated by the fear of missing out (FOMO). XRP: Regional Trends And Global Interest Interest in XRP is a worldwide phenomena, not limited in any one area at once. According to the statistics, searches for XRP point the charge towards the Netherlands, Australia, Ireland, Finland, and Slovenia. This general curiosity reflects a more general trend of revived interest in cryptocurrencies as they gather traction among regular investors. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Ready To Roar!

Although there is a wide range of predictions, from conservative estimates of $5 to more ambitious forecasts that imply potential highs of $300, one thing is certain: XRP is once again on the radar and could be on the brink of an exciting future in the crypto market.

Bitcoin's price surge is driven by reduced supply, increased demand, plus potential government adoption, giving it continued long-term upside. Dogecoin's recent rise is speculative and driven by memes and internet buzz about Elon Musk, but its fundamentals don't match Bitcoin's for stability and value. MicroStrategy's stock is overvalued due to irrational investor behavior–it's far wiser to invest directly in Bitcoin through ETFs like IBIT. A friend of mine put some Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) on a hard drive sometime in the 2010s. He soon forgot the password, but Bitcoin skyrocketed in price, turning a few-thousand-dollar hobby investment into lost treasure. He called me late last week with ecstatic news–the long-lost password came to him in a dream. Suddenly, he had found the keys to $200,000 in lost crypto. These crazy ups and downs are hardly unique to the crypto world. This same friend (and others) took heavy losses to fraud at FTX and Celsius. Another happily traded his crypto for a house. Some acquaintances got money and blew it all in Miami at E11EVEN, Club Space, and rented yachts. Other crypto people who I've met had stories that simply didn't add up, and I figured that they'd someday be minor characters in government indictments (later, they were, though I would have no idea how deeply the webs would be tangled). Bitcoin was intended for people who wanted to store value outside the traditional banking system, but the first thing the crypto world did after it started to gain popularity was essentially make an unregulated banking-type system. That broke rule #1, and many of the shady people marketing crypto immediately started doing what they do. But it wasn't Bitcoin's fault. Bitcoin is not the same thing as the crypto world. If the premise of Bitcoin is that inflation is a tax on savings and that government banking systems are simply designed to make the rich richer, then Bitcoin has a ton of value. The only thing standing in between that value and you are the middlemen. You can see on the graph below how Bitcoin has gone parabolic over the past few years. But not if you invested it with Sam Bankman-Fried. Bitcoin has been my best investment, and I've been able to realize it because I believe in BTC's future, but I'm healthily skeptical of middlemen and was willing to quickly pull money away from trouble. I think that there's a lot to believe in with Bitcoin, but I'm seeing a couple of potential traps with how people are currently investing their money. More on these later. Data by YCharts Why Is Bitcoin Up? I would argue that Bitcoin is up mainly because it's delivering on its original value proposition. BTC is doing exactly what it was designed to do, with its inflation now well under the rate of the US dollar and other major currencies. Even gold has some inflation caused by new supply being mined out of the earth, and Bitcoin's new supply is now below gold's historical inflation of 1-2% annually as well. With Trump winning the US presidential election and key proponents of crypto in positions of power, it's not inconceivable that the US Treasury could start to own some Bitcoin as well (for example, they've talked about holding the Bitcoin they seize from criminals rather than selling it). Another idea could be for the government to mine Bitcoin with excess solar or hydroelectric electricity that would otherwise be wasted. It sounds kind of crazy, but the US government has about $350 billion in gold at Fort Knox, so there is some precedent. I don't know to what extent this will happen, but investors are certainly excited about a crypto-friendly administration coming in. El Salvador president Nayib Bukele was mocked by the media for investing some of his country's money in Bitcoin, but he's sitting on a healthy profit now. Supply is down this year, demand is up, and the price of BTC is following. The supply side is pretty easy to figure out–Bitcoin had a halving event earlier this year that reduced inflation by 1/2 to roughly 0.8% per year . On the demand side, Bitcoin ETFs being approved earlier this year led to increased adoption and acceptance of Bitcoin as an asset class. And now, you have increased interest from sovereign buyers amid the US government discussions and El Salvador's continued buying. In economics, there's a saying that the cure for high prices is high prices. For example, when the price of silver shoots up, people see the ads on TV and dig through their houses to find their old silverware, jewelry, etc., and sell it back into the market. And when the price of gold or silver rises, there's more incentive to mine. There's no way to increase Bitcoin mining, so the question for Bitcoin here is, will a higher price incentivize existing holders to sell? Higher prices always incentivize some people to sell–I wrote above that a friend bought a house and some acquaintances blew their crypto riches. But higher prices can also cause some FOMO. I think it's impossible to make highly accurate predictions on short-term price movement, but Bitcoin and other assets tend to have momentum, meaning that they tend to keep going up when they're rising and vice versa. Dollar-cost averaging on the way in and out is my best recommendation for investors looking to move in or out of crypto. Bitcoin Copycat #1: Dogecoin There is only one Bitcoin. However, there are something like 20,000 cryptocurrencies in existence. Some of them are redundant, some of them are scams, and well over 99% of them are useless. Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ) is kind of a unique case as it was originally created as a joke but immediately got flooded with buyers. Dogecoin is surging again because of its proximity to Tesla ( TSLA ) founder Elon Musk. Musk likes jokes and frequently has tweeted about Dogecoin. Most recently, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy were appointed by Donald Trump to the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, to which someone cleverly attached the backronym of DOGE. When people found out about this, the internet went wild, and a new speculative frenzy in DOGE began. Dogecoin has more than doubled in price in the last 3 weeks, and you can buy it with the click of a couple of buttons on Robinhood ( HOOD ). If you think it's funny, and you want to put some money into it, feel free. But the last time people piled into DOGE was in 2021 before Elon went on Saturday Night Live, and as usual, retail investor interest peaked near the top. I wrote a piece on Dogecoin at the time that surprisingly became one of my most-read articles on Seeking Alpha. In the piece, I demonstrated that the biggest winners in most speculative bubbles are stock brokerages and the IRS , while market participants are playing a negative-sum game on an after-tax basis. Dogecoin never quite hit $1 like the TikTok prophets said it would, but hope springs eternal this time around. I assume most of the early holders cashed out–I mean, why wouldn't you trade a bunch of Dogecoin for a house if you could? Dogecoin's fundamentals don't match up with Bitcoin. The rate of inflation in Doge is currently around 3.5%, which is significantly higher than Bitcoin's rate of less than 1%. Moreover, transaction costs are significantly higher for DOGE than for Bitcoin, which can be easily traded with the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ). Trade DOGE for your entertainment, and if it brings you joy, then feel free. But even though Robinhood puts them side by side, Dogecoin is not in the same ballpark as Bitcoin. Buy Bitcoin if you want to buy crypto and simply ignore the frenzy in Doge. Bitcoin Copycat #2: MicroStrategy MicroStrategy Incorporated ( MSTR ) is probably the clearest current example of a Bitcoin copycat. For those of you who don't know, MicroStrategy is a software company that went public during the dot-com boom in 1998. MicroStrategy gained fame for skyrocketing during the dot-com boom and later gained infamy for crashing after being forced to massively restate its previous years' earnings in 2000. Unlike many dot-com businesses, MicroStrategy managed to stay in business, and in the 2010s the company was turning modest profits . The business started to sour later in the decade, and the company took the unusual step of investing its corporate reserves into Bitcoin in 2020. The timing was great, and Bitcoin started to ramp up later in 2020 into 2021, and MSTR ended up buying a lot more BTC after. While it's unusual, there's nothing necessarily wrong with investing corporate money in Bitcoin. MicroStrategy even borrowed money to buy more crypto, and while this is pretty risky, I've seen much crazier things for small companies to do to try to bail out their business. However, over time, MSTR has become somewhat of a crypto closed-end fund of sorts, with their Bitcoin pile hitting an estimated $26 billion. However, if you look at MicroStrategy's market cap, it's ballooned to nearly $75 billion. Their core business loses money, and they're essentially a Bitcoin hedge fund at this point, though they market themselves as an AI business. Investors buying this are betting on financial alchemy. You can't turn lead into gold, and simply buying Bitcoin shouldn't increase your company's market cap by multiples of the amount of Bitcoin you amass. MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor and his lieutenants are not dumb–far from it. However, I believe their interests are not aligned with the retail investors who are piling into MSTR, and the transfer of wealth is going to flow from the retail investors to the company over time. We're talking about potentially seeing a $40+ billion wealth transfer that could happen here in the next 12-24 months from retail investors in MSTR and MSTR itself. Financial markets create these sorts of products because there's money to be made. Heck, in South Korea they're even planning a triple leveraged Berkshire Hathaway fund . You have to know how to do some serious due diligence to invest in this sort of stuff, though. Data by YCharts Here you can see that while Bitcoin is up 146% over the last year, MSTR is up 600%. That's not rational, considering MSTR's only real moneymaker is investing in Bitcoin. On a back-of-the-envelope calculation, for every dollar you put into MSTR, you're getting less than 35 cents in NAV. Put another way, the fair value of MSTR is roughly $127 per share. The underlying value of MSTR has risen as investors pile money into the stock and the company issues shares on the open market at crazy high prices. Eventually, these two numbers will converge. However, it's not likely to be favorable for retail investors in MSTR. You can buy IBIT and get 100 cents of Bitcoin for each dollar you invest, and fees of somewhere in the neighborhood of 0.15% annually. Or you can buy MSTR and get less than 35 cents of value for each dollar you buy. This is a bubble that is all but guaranteed to burst. Bitcoin is going to outperform MSTR, and that's why MSTR is selling its stock to the public and buying Bitcoin with it. It's genius for them, but not so much for everyone piling in. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) illustrates how these types of market inefficiencies can work. Data by YCharts At first, GBTC traded for huge premiums to NAV. There was a game here. Institutional investors could buy GBTC at fair market value, hold for 6 months, and then sell to the public for 1.5 to 2x the value of the actual Bitcoin because there was so much demand. When people started to figure out that they were buying into a closed-end fund with high fees and no way out, the fund traded for a discount. That's when I started buying, knowing that they intended to convert the fund to an ETF to unlock the frozen value. A legal battle with the SEC ensued, but Grayscale won in the end, and it ended up being a great trade and outperforming Bitcoin itself. The discount eventually equalized. Today, MSTR trades for a higher premium to NAV than GBTC ever did, and most of the premium has appeared in a matter of weeks. Moreover, the company is actively unloading as much as $21 billion in stock at a premium to try to capture as much of this spread as possible. If you own MSTR, you should run, not walk to the exit. Simply sell and move your money into IBIT, and you avoid this whole accident waiting to happen. Bottom Line While I continue to be a long-term believer in Bitcoin, glaring market inefficiencies in copycat products underscore just how much misinformation and craziness there is in the crypto market. If you want to buy Bitcoin, I recommend dollar-cost averaging into IBIT and avoiding the swamp of crazy crypto products and funds out there.",NEUTRAL,BTC | DOGE,BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4738509-with-bitcoin-topping-90000-beware-crypto-copycats-like-dogecoin-and-microstrategy?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36533971.jpeg
