42430104,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMRKhh,1547305199,Tokenized Securities: Curb Your Enthusiasm,"Noelle Acheson is a veteran of company analysis and member of CoinDesk’s product team.  The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a newsletter for the institutional market, with news and views on crypto infrastructure delivered every Tuesday. Sign up here.      With so much buzz around tokenized securities, compounded by strong progress from platforms and issuers, it’s worth looking at the hurdles still ahead, and what they mean for investors.  First, a brief recap: by “tokenized securities,"" we mean a crypto asset that reflects an investment in things that do not typically trade on liquid exchanges. Obvious examples are real estate and private equity, but the concept can also apply to art, diamonds, ships and other coveted items that are difficult to exchange efficiently.  The technology for this is developing fast – platforms and specific token designs are emerging to make it easier for issuers, investors and regulators to get comfortable with the concept.  On a panel at CoinDesk's Consensus: Invest conference in November, Harbor announced the launch of its platform with the first tokenized real estate investment trust (REIT), and an entire panel about crypto wealth management declared itself bullish on security tokens.  More recently, SharesPost, a broker-dealer and alternative trading system (ATS), said last week it had executed the first secondary trade of security token in which the assets were held in custody by the same ATS. This was a notable milestone because large investors are required in the U.S. to use a qualified custodian.  Why such enthusiasm? By wrapping a traditional asset in a tradeable piece of code, tokenized securities offer a way to broaden access to investments by lowering barriers such as illiquidity, high entry points and steep costs.  They also open up the possibility of more detailed configurations, making it possible to design return opportunities tailored to specific objectives, and they potentially offer greater transparency as to ownership and movement.  While the promise is great, the reality – as usual – is more complicated.  Liquid diet  One thing often overlooked in the excitement is that a new technology does not create liquidity. Markets create liquidity. Without supply and demand, the tokens will not trade. And demand does not necessarily spontaneously emerge.  And not just any supply and demand will do. Liquidity, in the traditional financial definition, requires sufficient volume of buy and sell orders around the current price so that a large order will not noticeably move the market. With new types of investment, that is not easy to come by.  Initially, this probably won’t matter much, since the initial tokens – assuming that they are compliant with U.S. securities registration exemptions – will only be available to accredited investors. Yet even these wealthy investors will want relatively narrow spreads, something that only happens when there is a certain level of trading activity on a platform.  Furthermore, for the market to fully realize its portfolio-management potential, derivative markets would need to emerge on top of the security tokens. This could bring further regulatory and transparency complications, as final ownership gets obfuscated through borrowing and hedging.  Settling down  Settlement is another issue. Immediate settlement is often touted as an advantage, citing a more efficient use of funds. Actually, it’s the opposite – to settle immediately, buyers will need to have the necessary amount already in the relevant account.  In traditional finance, the money gets moved when it is needed, not before. Until then, it “rests” in interest-bearing instruments. Middlemen provide assurance to seller and buyer that the trade will happen, giving them time to get the funds and assets ready for exchange. Sure, it may be faster and cheaper to do it on a blockchain with instant settlement – but that may not be in the best interests of the buyer.  Another hurdle is conceptual: are these a new asset class? Or are they just a reconfiguration of an existing one?  In other words, do they require a new framework for investing – new metrics, dashboards and knowledge base for a new investor? Or is the target market the same as the old target market, only a bit broader? If the latter, how long before it becomes comfortable with crypto assets? Is it really worth the while to do so, given the relative “clunkiness” and youth of the new platforms?  Gaining momentum  Solutions will most likely emerge to all of these obstacles. It’s not easy to spin up a market, but with perseverance, communication and investment, it can happen.  The settlement issue could be solved with further innovation in payment methods and types of programmable money. And the conceptual confusion will settle with time. The benefits are intriguing, and even traditional market participants tend to be open-minded when it comes to the possibility of enhanced returns.  Given the intensifying build-up of tokenized security technology and marketing, as well as increasing regulatory clarity, we are likely to see a flurry of activity in onboarding and launches over the coming months. And as the market gets comfortable with the concept, the creativity of the issuers and sophistication of the investors will generate new opportunities for wealth creation, hopefully broadening access to both returns and capital. This will encourage further development in the crypto space, opening up even greater potential.  But we need to keep our expectations realistic. Getting the technology working is just the first step. Markets are unpredictable, and reliable demand for these new assets may take time to emerge.  Early investors usually get access to greater profits than latecomers, which is fair given the higher risk. But no one knows how long they will have to wait.

42430100,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMRKZh,1547294347,I'm As Certain As Ever – Bitcoin's Revolution Is Only Just Beginning,"Tim Draper is a founding partner of Draper Associates and headmaster at Draper University.  For more on bitcoin's 10th anniversary, check out our new interactive feature Bitcoin At 10.    ---------------------------------------------------------------    It wasn’t 10 years ago, but more like 15, when I first saw the potential for a digital currency. I’ve been through some big up and downs in bitcoin. But today, I’m more certain than ever that the bitcoin revolution is coming.  In 2004, I learned from a wealthy Korean industrialist that people were paying real-world money for digital items like weapons to use in massively multiplayer video games. The game was “Lineage,” which was taking Seoul by storm.  It got me thinking that there was an amazing business in virtual goods coming.  Later, Joel Yarmon first introduced me to bitcoin in about 2011. He brought in Peter Vincennes and his company Coinlab to pitch us. Bitcoin was a new currency that could be used to store value and pay for anything, not just for advancement in a video game.  I quickly absorbed the basics of bitcoin: miners, wallets and such. The decreasing number of bitcoins available to be mined over time meant that the price of a bitcoin would increase in value as fewer bitcoins were mined and usage increased. In fact, as bitcoins spread and their usage increased, it was likely that the currency would become more valuable.  Coinlab would become a bitcoin-focused innovator and miner. We made a small investment in the company. My son Adam started an accelerator called Boost VC, dedicated to bitcoin (and blockchain) companies. He was the first investor in Coinbase.  Around that time, I asked Peter if I could buy $250,000 worth of bitcoin. He bought some for me at about $6 each and stored them in Mt. Gox, the largest bitcoin exchange at the time. He said he would also buy a high-speed mining chip from Butterfly Labs to get us even cheaper bitcoin. Both of these efforts went south.  First, the mining chip was delayed. Rather than shipping it to Peter as ordered, Butterfly Labs used the chip to mine bitcoins for themselves. By the time Peter received the ASIC chips, mining had dramatically increased in difficulty. Meanwhile, the bitcoin I had bought was “lost” by Mt. Gox.  Bitcoin's resilience  But something important happened with the failure of Mt. Gox. The price of bitcoin only dropped about 20 percent, and the currency continued to be traded on other exchanges. I was flabbergasted and fascinated.  I realized that the demand for this new digital currency was so strong that even a huge theft would not keep bitcoin from creating a new way for us to transact, store and move money. Since the financial crisis, people were losing their confidence in government or “fiat” currencies. I went on to back a number of the Boost VC bitcoin companies, and as I was discovering more and more uses, an enormous opportunity arose.  And something happened that gave me another shot at getting involved in the bitcoin opportunity. The U.S. Marshall’s office confiscated the bitcoins owned by the Silk Road, an online drug marketplace, and almost 30,000 bitcoins were put up for auction. I looked at this as an opportunity to rebuy the bitcoins I lost.  The market price then was $618 per bitcoin. At the last minute, I decided to bid higher than market price. I bid $632 and won all of the bitcoins!  After the inevitable buyer’s remorse for paying a higher price than anyone else was willing to pay, I thought about how I could best drive a positive use for these bitcoins with a tainted past. I decided that I would use them to support the proliferation of bitcoin through emerging country marketplaces where people didn’t have confidence in their own currencies.  Many people in such countries are not “bankable.” Banks lose money on people who don’t have enough to make all the paperwork worthwhile. Banking regulations set up to protect the little guy have actually kept the little guy from participating in the economy — almost guaranteeing that he will remain “the little guy.” There are billions of “unbanked.”  Avish Bhama, one Boost entrepreneur with a company called Mirror helped me figure out a good plan to spread the currency to emerging country markets. The idea was to allow people from developing nations the ability to invest in anything (even to go short against their own currency) by using bitcoin as the “rails,” the conduit for the trades.  Mirror later changed its business model, but companies I backed later — BitPesa in Africa, Bitpagos in Latin America, and CoinHako in Southeast Asia — are making the emerging world their marketplace.  Bitcoin’s great potential  I remain impressed by the possibilities for bitcoin and blockchain. Bitcoin is a currency that is accepted everywhere without any government friction or interference, a stored value solution that doesn’t require a holder to keep a room full of metals and art, and a frictionless currency that can move automatically based on a contract, without the usual drag that comes from regulations and accounting rules.  But there are many other uses.  A bitcoin wallet can also be used as an escrow for a contract in transition, as a redistribution of an estate or as a transfer agent to distribute payments, dividends or shares of stock. Blockchains can keep track of money, data, inventory, contracts, etc., and “smart” contracts can be designed such that they anticipate eventualities and automatically distribute funds appropriately. Corporations can use the blockchain to automatically pay employees their wages and benefits, pay shareholders their dividends, and pay noteholders their interest and principal payments, all with precise accuracy and automated accounting.  The blockchain can manage three-way transfers with ease, and eventually will handle retail transactions without the need for credit or debit cards. Insurance companies can use it to manage their claims and automate collections. Real estate escrows and titles can all be done quickly and easily between buyer and seller. Drugs and food can be authenticated by blockchain to guarantee their origins.  And the U.S. Government can manage social security, welfare, Medicare, worker’s comp, disability and all their data verification of citizens and businesses with bitcoin and the blockchain, since blockchain is the perfect government employee.  It is honest, incorruptible, secure, and fair.  Change is coming  Many industries will have to go through fundamental changes to adapt to the advent of this new way of thinking. People will have to learn that the bank, being the trusted third party for centuries will soon be replaced by computers that now monitor their holdings through the blockchain. Banking will be simpler, safer and easier than relying on people to do the monotonous work in some brick-and-mortar facility.  It is interesting to note that countries, now recognizing that they are in competition with one another, are trying to make sure they win the bitcoin economy. The smartest of these are either allowing bitcoin to prosper or recognize that they need a light touch in regulating bitcoin to attract all the creativity, money and startups that are flooding into the field.  The U.S. was wise to leave the internet unregulated and free because all the internet entrepreneurs created startups domestically and the economy around the internet blossomed. Keeping its regulatory hands light should help innovators stay in the U.S.  There are many parallels between bitcoin now and the internet in 1994. In 1994, the internet was just for hobbyists and hackers. I remember when I first used the Internet, the only things I could do were to buy diamonds and try to break into NORAD. There were very few uses. It took many years for the internet to become mainstream, but when it did, it transformed industries.  The long-term vision for bitcoin is to give the world economic emancipation. The potential if bitcoin is only limited by the imaginations of the entrepreneurs who work to drive this new virtual economy. To monitor and keep it honest, I believe that the community of users will ultimately self-regulate, possibly eclipsing or obviating the need for the various governments to regulate the crypto world.  I’ve been through the ups and downs with bitcoin, and I am as certain as ever that the bitcoin revolution is coming.  It is here to bank the unbanked, to democratize economic opportunity and to reevaluate governance. I expect that it will change everything from the banks and the financial system to healthcare, to democracy, even the government.

42430122,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMRL3h,1547290811,Web 3.0's Crypto Winter Mission: Keep Our Heads Above the Hype,"Jutta Steiner is the founder and CEO of Parity Technologies, a blockchain infrastructure and innovation focused company building platforms and applications.  The following is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2018 Year in Review.  The past year has seen an onslaught of doom-and-gloom narratives shower down on our fledgling movement, in stark contrast to the inflated hype cycle we swam through the year before. I am here to report that this year has, in fact, been a tremendously productive one for the teams hard at work building the decentralized web’s core infrastructure.  We are far from drowning in the expectations that were set 2017 – rather, we have a found refreshing calm and focus in the storm many have dubbed “Crypto Winter.”  When Gavin Wood and I left the Ethereum Foundation to co-found Parity Technologies just three years ago, we knew that the path forward would likely provide a bit of a wild ride. We had already been through the waves of speculation that surrounded our work ensuring Ethereum’s launch and knew that as the spotlight brightened, these tidal hype surges would likely become more dramatic. We took the opportunity to build Parity Ethereum in 2015 while global enthusiasm was waning and delivered the fastest and most secure software for Ethereum, helping support the next phase of intense public interest with strong, proven technology.  We find ourselves in a very similar position today at the end of 2018.  Huge strides have been made in the development of the technology that supports innovation of a better web and more reliable institutions. This is where the focus should be.  This crypto winter we put everything we have learned building Ethereum, bitcoin, Polkadot and application-specific blockchain implementations into Substrate — a free, open-source blockchain development framework.  Now, even developers new to decentralized Web3 infrastructure will be able to spin up their own blockchains, networks and services in just minutes or days. Projects using Substrate will be able to freely access the same state-of-the-art tech stack we are using to build the interoperability network Polkadot for the Web3 Foundation and Parity Ethereum 2.0 (Serenity) with support from the Ethereum Foundation.  This is the sort of core infrastructure that helped support the last swell of development and innovation, and it will go a long way towards bolstering the next one.  Wider progress  The chill has also fared well for many of the projects and teams we work together with closely.  For instance, great progress has been made in our ongoing collaboration with Protocol Labs to develop and implement the LibP2P network stack, a key piece of networking technology that we will be using in Substrate, Polkadot and Ethereum 2.0. Melonport, the first decentralized protocol for asset management, launched this February.  The World Food Program’s Building Blocks  project, which we built with the U.N. using Parity Ethereum, started to scale up and will be tested across more of the U.N.’s various divisions, as the WFP’s project has proven to save on upfront costs as well as 1.5-3 percent per transaction on the ground.  The program will have helped feed over 500,000 refugees by the end of the year at a lower cost, allowing funding to reach deeper into impacted areas. And finally, Zcash successfully pushed the Sapling network upgrade this year, greatly improving the prospects for improved user privacy in a Web3 future.  We are excited to start work on a Parity Zcash node this year in partnership with the Zcash Foundation.  The next year will see major network launches and upgrades from Tezos, Ethereum, Polkadot, and more – all united in a common vision to put the internet back into the hands of its users. The core teams building these networks are all growing rapidly – Parity doubled in size this year and we plan to double in size again next year. The Web3 Foundation will also continue hiring into the next year along with many of the teams listed here.  Our builder’s view on how much progress we have made towards this vision was crystalized at Web3 Summit at the end of the year, where the teams mentioned above and more came together for three vibrant days in Berlin. There was no sense of worry about markets or talk about where prices were going to go, just a clear focus on the task at hand and the work that needed to be done to accomplish it.  The time is now  We have also seen a great deal of reinforcement for the necessity of Web3 over the past year. This movement has seen this before and know that as history evolves, the implications of a truly peer-to-peer internet will become larger.  I strongly believe that 2018 will go down as a pivotal point in the growth and maturity of the Web3 movement:  In 2018, we learned about Cambridge Analytica, Facebook’s ever-expanding list of issues and have seen more clearly than ever the depth of global surveillance and data misuse – after we had five years to ponder the meaning of the Snowden revelations.  In 2018, we mourned the ten-year anniversary of the 2008 financial crisis and the impact that abuses by the financial services industry had on ourselves, our families and our world.  In 2018, we celebrated Bitcoin’s 10th birthday and considered how far we have come from Satoshi’s white paper.  In 2018, we remember the first time we read the Ethereum white paper, five years ago.  In January 2019, we will view a world 20 years along from the first printings of the Euro and analyze what the future might hold for this experiment in monetary policy.  In 2019, we will see a new generation of open-source, peer-to-peer networks launch and start to fulfill the promise made to return control and privacy to the internet’s users when my co-founder Gavin Wood first coined the concept of Web 3.0 through networks of decentralized applications almost five years ago when designing the specification for Ethereum.  The next year is a promising one, and I hope you see the light through the storm as I do.  Despite the deflated narrative we have weathered over the past year, this time was by no means wasted. Those building this future decentralized internet have been hard at work.
