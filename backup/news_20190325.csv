42430330,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMrGPh,1553551216,"A Bitcoin Lightning Web Standard, Inspired By Ethereum, Is Gaining Steam","Sending bitcoin lightning payments over the web might soon get easier.  That's because a new bitcoin standard for simplifying lightning payments, the open-source WebLN standard, is gaining traction, now being used by Lightning Joule and Bluewallet, two of the more popular lightning wallets, as well as apps like Lightning Spin, to slim down the number of steps a user needs to make a payment.  This is an important step for lightning, an experimental technology that is still risky to send real money over. Developer warnings aren't stopping eager users from trying out what they believe to be the future of bitcoin payments, and as they've toyed with payments, they've bumped into issues trying to send or receive value.  The standard, written by developer William O'Beirne, is inspired by his work contributing to popular ethereum services, MyCrypto and MyEtherWallet, both of which are used for storing ethereum's native currency, ether. This might seem a bit odd because bitcoin and ethereum users often seem like rivals, battling on Twitter and debating the merits of each cryptocurrency. But O'Beirne doesn't seem to care about that.  His work on ethereum's web standard, Web3, led him to what he calls an ""a-ha moment,"" where he decided lightning opens up opportunities for a similar set of standards for bitcoin that could make interacting with payments on the Web much easier.  ""The Web is the most obvious place for micropayments,"" O'Beirne argued.  The ultimate goal, as he showed in his presentation of Chrome browser extension Lightning Joule last fall, is to embed payments into the web so that they're really easy to use.  O'Beirne told CoinDesk:  ""I want to make it really easy for new lightning projects to have a great UX for making payments without having to reinvent the wheel of how to display payments to users, or get them to provide invoices.""  He gave an example of a WebLN-enabled site that allowed users to quickly paying a Satoshi (worth about $0.00004) to get rid of advertisements for the day.  Easier payments  That said, while WebLN is inspired by ethereum, O'Beirne says ""WebLN is a lot more stripped down than Web3."" After all, lightning is not a ""Turing-complete system."" Rather, since bitcoin's lightning is more focused on payments, that's where the focus of WebLN lies.  But it's similar in that it's a standard that makes app building easier for developers. And in the end, helps to reduce the number of steps users need to take to make a payment.  By example, Bluewallet recently launched a marketplace within its mobile app that lists a bunch of different services which accept lightning transactions, including LN.pizza, Bitrefill, a startup that sells gift cards for bitcoin, and the like.  If a user were to go to, say, the LN pizza website on its own, they would have to grab the invoice by copying it, open their lightning wallet, then stick it in the wallet.  But if you go straight through Bluewallet marketplace, it simplifies the process. It automatically grabs the invoice and copies it into Bluewallet for a user to pay to buy their pizza. ""They use WebLN to inject [the invoice] into the page,"" O'Beirne said.  ""[WebLN] allows us to provide a better user experience – like one-tap payments and withdraws, and facilitates and standardizes ""actions"" that should be standardized for the sake of the industry moving faster and in the right direction. So we fully support it and try to make other developers to do the same,"" BlueWallet product and UX engineer Nuno Coehlo told CoinDesk, adding that it has enabled ""thousands"" of purchases.  This little marketplace is like a window into how much easier the process could be for lightning micropayments across the World Wide Web, if such a standard gained enough traction and was used everywhere – perhaps the big dream goal – rather than just on a few random apps.  Lightning apps can get this functionality to work for their app if they want. But with a standard like WebLN, the idea is developers don't need to reinvent the wheel.  Or, O'Beirne added, in the future, he plans to add an experimental technology that allows users to send money directly to a node without generating an invoice.  WebLN has some other features as well that aren't quite related to payments.  ""There’s also an element of identity,"" O'Beirne said, where users could use their lightning node's public key – a string of random letters and numbers showing – to login to a website. It could effectively replace passwords.  ""Some of this is still being built out,"" he added.  'Stealth' projects and beyond  Still, as the project GitHub points out, WebLN is still ""early-stage"" and ""subject to change.""  O'Beirne said that next steps are to improve the developer documentation and draw up some demo videos to make it easier for developers to implement WebLN.  O'Beirne has also been in touch with Casa (a popular lightning service that launched a Chrome extension similar to Lightning Joule, but with different functionality), as well as Bitlum, another browser-based wallet. But while both seem interested in WebLN, neither wallet has ""committed"" to doing so quite yet.  Other ""stealth projects"" are interested, too. ""I get DMs from people working on stealth projects – asking how the spec works.""  Over the summer, O'Beirne will be working at Chaincode Labs, a research group led by Bitcoin Core contributors Alex Morcos and Suhas Daftuar that funds some of bitcoin's most active protocol developers. He hopes that this will give him an opportunity to continue working on WebLN, and get more wallets to adopt the standard.  All that said, though, there's also another standard lightning developers are eyeing right now that has to do with standardizing how lightning is used in the Web: W3C, which is the international organization drawing up rules for the Web for all browsers to follow.  Since some think developers should focus on that set of standards, O'Beirne goes as far as to call it a ""spec war."" But so far, there don't seem to be any implementations of W3C that support lightning.  That said, he sees WebLN gaining traction as he works on it this summer: ""At this point, I feel like we’re going to see more adoption. At least for generating lightning invoices, which is a frustrating experience.""

42430341,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMrGhh,1553543730,Bitcoin's Trading Range Narrows In March to Hit Two-Year Low,"Bitcoin’s average daily trading range so far in March is its lowest in nearly two years when, at the time, the world’s largest cryptocurrency was worth roughly a quarter of what it is now.  At the time of writing, bitcoin’s average 24-hour trading range so far this month, defined as the average difference between the high and low price of each day in a given month, has been just $85, its lowest average range since the same metric recorded $32 in April of 2017, according to CoinDesk data.  Notably, the average trading range (also known as the average daily volatility) segmented by month has fallen much faster than bitcoin's market prices as can be seen below.  Indeed, bitcoin is currently trading across exchanges at an average price of $3,943, comparable to levels seen in September 2017, while volatility has returned to levels observed when bitcoin’s price was roughly $1,000.  Yet, periods of low volatility tend to precede a big move in either direction in a market, as was the case in 2017.  In fact, April of 2017 was the first month to close sufficiently above the top of its previous bull run in 2013 and was followed by a multi-year bear market. After April closed with an average daily trading range of $32, the price of bitcoin went on to surge 65 percent the following month with an average daily trading range of $153 – nearly four times higher than that seen the month prior.  BTC/USD Weekly Chart  Just as bitcoin's price was indecisive in April as it approached the key technical hurdle of a previous all-time high, bitcoin is now approaching another major technical hurdle in the form of long term downtrend resistance.  As shown above, bitcoin's current price is just below a crucial downtrend line, which if broken could be a sign its market has shifted from bearish to bullish or at-least bearish to neutral, just as it did in 2015 when prices surpassed a near identical downtrend line.

OKChain is currently at the “final” development stage, the company said, adding that a test network launch is expected in June.  Due to demand, the exchange said it will put OKB onto an ethereum ERC-20 standard blockchain by the end of April, and will migrate all tokens to OKChain later and once the new network is ""stable.""  According to the announcement:  ""OKB will be the native token of the OKChain network, which can be used to settle transaction fees, or used in the Dapps [decentralized apps] developed on OKChain.""  It seems a decentralized exchange is the latest must-have accessory for exchanges.  Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by adjusted trading volume, is also launching a DEX on its own blockchain network.  Binance opened its DEX for public testing last month, allowing users to create wallets and interact with the trading platform’s interface. Last month, the exchange also announced a trading competition with prizes of $100,000 in its native token BNB in a bid to boost the number of people testing the platform.

Slightly more than half of the new capital (8.27 million Swiss francs, or roughly $8.34 million) came in the form of cash, with the rest coming as converted debt, according to the filings with the Swiss Commercial Register.  B3i had previously raised 6.3 million Swiss francs (about $6.35 million) around the time it was incorporated in March 2018.  The company did not respond to a request for comment by press time, but it was known to be seeking funds (some reports have stated it could be targeting as much as $200 million).  News of the filing was reported earlier by Ledger Insights.  New board members  The firm has also shuffled its board, adding new executives from existing consortium members for the most part, according to commercial records.  Gerhard Lohmann, CFO of reinsurance at Swiss Re, has stepped down from the B3i board and was replaced by Theo Bachmann, a managing director and the head of the property and casualty (P&C) insurance underwriting center at Swiss Re.

The firm aims to use distributed ledgers to streamline fragmented back-office processes and claims handling. In March 2018, it made the leap from a consortium to an independent company, in order to commercialize some of the solutions it had developed.

The partnership will see Kaiko and Inca offering BTC and ETH OTC reference rates to their customers, including asset managers and institutions, trueDigital said.  “Kaiko’s mission is to build the data distribution infrastructure for institutional involvement in the cryptoassets industry. Our partnership with trueDigital will further this mission while also promoting much-needed data transparency,” said Kaiko CEO Ambre Soubiran.  Inca will also use the reference rates data to develop new analytics, according to the announcement. “The aim is to provide users with institutional-grade pricing data that helps elevate the quality of trading and risk management.”  TrueDigital’s OTC reference rates for BTC and ETH were launched in July of last year in partnership with nine firms to enable “institutional grade derivative products.” Back in January, the firm similarly partnered with three other firms – CMT Digital, Blockfills and QCP Capital – for distribution of its reference rates.  The reference rates are derived from the bid and offer prices from trueDigital’s 12 institutional market-maker partners, including Genesis Global Trading and Circle.  Last month, trueDigital hired a new CEO from the world’s largest hedge fund Bridgewater Associates. The firm has also helped build a blockchain payments system for crypto-friendly Signature Bank in December.

42430333,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMrGXh,1553518845,'A Sad Joke': Bitcoin Cash's Lead Coder Quits Bitcoin Unlimited Project,"Amaury Séchet, a leading developer of bitcoin cash, is renouncing his membership in one of the projects that paved the way for the controversial cryptocurrency.  He's sticking with bitcoin cash as lead developer of the code implementation BitcoinABC, but he's unhappy with the direction of Bitcoin Unlimited, a code implementation that arguably got bitcoin cash off the ground as one of the first code implementations to increase bitcoin's block size parameter.  All these different ""bitcoins"" may be hard to keep track of, but it's important to note that Bitcoin Unlimited remains relevant because it provides an alternative code implementation of bitcoin cash.  Revealed to CoinDesk prior to publication, Séchet wrote a detailed explanation for his departure, posted to Medium Monday, in which he explained he is disappointed with Bitcoin Unlimited's development process, partly because lingering bugs in the code allowed an unknown developer to crash most Bitcoin Unlimited nodes.  Instead of getting better, he argues Bitcoin Unlimited's process has since gotten worse:  ""The BUIP process has turned into a sad joke, with proposals more and more absurd being voted on. BU leaders are complacent and, while saying that the attitude of the [Bitcoin Satoshi's Vision (BSV)] community will cost them developer support, they continue to enable the toxic behavior by supporting BSV.""  Stepping back, while Bitcoin Unlimited paved the way, Bitcoin ABC was the first group to actually go through with these promises to increase the blocksize parameter back in 2017. Then sentiments in the community began to strain, partly because Craig Wright, a developer who claims to have created bitcoin (without evidence), joined bitcoin cash's ranks.  A bit over a year after bitcoin cash launched, Wright went to war with developers, including Séchet, ultimately breaking bitcoin cash into two cryptocurrencies: bitcoin cash and bitcoin SV (BSV).  As this happened, Bitcoin Unlimited released software supporting both cryptocurrencies. But this code split ended up splintering the Bitcoin Unlimited team, with some eagerly supporting BSV. Drama between bitcoin cash and bitcoin SV hasn't stopped with the fork, however. A few days ago, influential bitcoin cash coder, Antony Zegers, left Bitcoin Unlimited as a member, inspiring Séchet to follow.  ""The Bitcoin Cash project seeks to bring more freedom to the world by engaging in voluntary cooperation to build a better form of money. It is important that the Bitcoin Cash community protect itself from people and groups attempting to take advantage of its cooperative nature and undermine the project,"" Séchet continued.  He concluded:  ""My goal is to make Bitcoin Cash successful. Life is too short, and convenient sound money is a goal too important to be distracted from.""

42430329,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMrGJh,1553515208,"Blockchain Financial Plumbing Is Still Years Away, Says LSE Spinoff Exactpro","The Takeaway:  Several major blockchain projects aim to streamline post-trade processing for securities.  The new systems are still prototypes and need rigorous testing before safely connecting to live infrastructure.  A former unit of the London Stock Exchange, QA specialist Exactpro, estimates that DLT post-trade systems may still be two years away from such testing.  The upshot for big post-trade blockchains is the potential for further delays.      If blockchain is supposed to be the new plumbing for the world’s financial markets, then think of Exactpro as the home inspector who checks the pipes for leaks.  A former subsidiary of the London Stock Exchange whose management bought it out in 2018, Exactpro employs some 560 specialists who test trading and clearing systems for traditional securities exchanges, investment banks, brokers and technology firms.  As such, the firm knows better than most the ins and outs of “post-trade,” the back office processing after a trade is complete where buyer and seller change records of ownership and arrange for the transfer of securities and cash.  And in Exactpro’s estimation, distributed ledger technology (DLT) systems are still a few years shy of tough benchmark software tests, which they would have to pass before anyone could use them to handle post-trade processes in the real world.  “I think there are still gaps in technology so we can’t assume that the fabrics already support everything,” Iosif Itkin, co-CEO and co-founder of Exactpro, told CoinDesk. “I think it is still a question of a couple of years before there will be a radical shift from prototyping to software testing.”  What’s more, even when they reach this testing phrase, Itkin is skeptical that they’ll pass at first, telling CoinDesk:  “Based on our experience in post-trade and what we've observed with the prototypes, I do have doubts on the outcome of the first rounds of real testing.”  If he’s right, a number of ambitious DLT projects tacking post-trade could have to push their go-live dates further into the future to account for an exacting round of tests.  For example, Digital Asset is busy replacing Australian Securities Exchange's (ASX’s) CHESS system for cash equities, which had been pushed back until Q2 2021. Meanwhile, the blockchain re-platforming of DTCC’s credit derivatives Trade Information Warehouse is scheduled to go live later this year. And recently, R3 Corda was recently contracted to build the DLT plumbing for Swiss exchange SIX Digital, also slated to go live this year.  So far, Exactpro is only considering the DLT created by R3 (with which it has a partnership), Hyperledger (it's a member of the consortium) and Digital Asset, and has not focused on any enterprise versions of the ethereum blockchain. (Hyperledger, R3, Digital Asset did not return requests for comment.)  Points of failure  In particular, the most likely points of failure will be where these DLT systems connect to legacy architecture, according to Exactpro, which will present a white paper on its methodology for testing such “hybrid financial software” at the ICST 2019 conference in China next month.  Itkin noted that DLT systems are still largely at the prototype stage and therefore the builders are trying to prove that these things work. The essence of software testing, by contrast, is to try to break it. In other words, pushing an already battle-hardened system to explore its limits is a very different ballgame from proving a prototype can muster a minimum viable product.  “Professional testers always expect that the system will not work,” Itkin said. “Other testers assume that the system will be OK. Good for them. Bad for the live service.”  When Exactpro designs a test strategy for a next-generation post-trade system, as it recently began doing (with non-DLT tech) at Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX), it checks both the functional specifications and also non-characteristic conditions, such as when a huge load is placed on the system, or in the case of a server going down or some other type of service disruption.  Most of the problems, when these systems go live, will happen at the boundary between a distributed ledger and the rest of the platform, Itkin predicts. He pointed out this has also been observed in crypto exchanges, where most of the problems are not within the fabric of the exchange itself, but at the intersection with the “real world.”  Itkin said that when looking at implementing DLT prototypes, his team constantly finds particular parts are not implemented yet. For example, “domain models are absent in most of the areas and software developers need to build them from scratch for every new use-case. In the code, there are still some trade-offs between what is already available and the security/reliability requirements.”  He reiterated that such missing parts are well known to developers and expected to be released in the next versions, adding,  “It is just [that] there is still lots of work to do.”  Itkin added that Exactpro does a fair amount of work in the swaps space and is interested in the possibility of implementing the International Swaps and Derivatives Association’s Common Domain Model on R3’s Corda, adding,  “We are looking at the systems that are most likely to be used as the foundation of the future generation of settlement and clearing systems, and Corda, Hyperledger and DA look like the most probable candidates to serve as the foundation going forward.”    See: ExactPro White Paper on Scribd    Machine and pipes image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/03/25/blockchain-financial-plumbing-is-still-years-away-says-lse-spinoff-exactpro,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bd2901cb4c790fb258df2a3b015873c8d6fdf69b-1500x1033.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42430340,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMrGjh,1553511645,"Bitcoin Price Consolidation Continues, Downside Break Looks Likely","View  Bitcoin's current trading range of $3,920–$4,055 could be breached to the downside, as last week's doji candle created at the key 21- week moving average resistance is signaling bullish exhaustion.  A downside break of the trading range, if confirmed, could yield a sell-off toward the support levels lined up at $3,775 and $3,658.  On the higher side, a UTC close above $4,055 is needed to put the bulls back into the driver's seat, although that looks unlikely at press time.  Chart signals of bullish exhaustion suggest bitcoin's (BTC) narrowing trading range could soon be breached to the downside.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value is sidelined below $4,000 for the fourth straight day, and has been restricted to the narrow range of $3,920–$4,055 since March 17, according to Bitstamp data.  More importantly, prices clocked a high and low of $4,055 and $3,920, respectively, last week before closing Sunday (UTC) largely unchanged at $3,970. The price swing formed what’s termed a doji candle on the weekly chart, which is usually taken to represent indecision in the marketplace.  The candle, however, has appeared following a 20 percent rally from lows near $3,300 seen at the end of January. So, it could be argued that the indecision, as represented by the doji, is predominantly among the buyers.  As a result, the probability of BTC ending the ongoing consolidation with a convincing break below $3,920 appears high.  As of writing, BTC is trading at $3,970 on Bitstamp, largely changed on a 24-hour basis.  Weekly chart  As seen above, BTC created a doji candle at the crucial 21-week moving average (MA) resistance, validating the bearish view put forward by that still-downward sloping momentum indicator.  The case for the downside break of the $3,920–$4,055 trading range looks stronger if we take into account the price action seen over the last five weeks.  To start with, BTC hit a high of $4,190 and created a bullish inverted hammer candle in the third week of February – a sign the market is bottoming out. That candlestick is usually followed by a quick move to the higher side.  In the last four weeks, however, BTC has failed to again challenge $4,190, weakening the bullish case.  Daily and 4-hour charts  On the daily chart, the short-term MA studies are now biased toward the bears, with the 5-day MA having dropped below the 10-day MA. Further, with the price well below the March 21 high of $4,055, the bearish outside-reversal candle created on that day is still valid.  So, the sideways channel seen in the 4-hour chart could be breached to the downside in the next day or two.  A range breakdown if confirmed would open the doors for a deeper drop toward $3,658 (Feb. 27 low).  A UTC close well above $4,055 would revive the short-term bullish view and could yield a rally toward $4,200, although gains may be short-lived, as the 21-week MA is still trending south.

42430326,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMrGFh,1553508059,Central Banks See 'No Value' in Issuing Digital Currency: BIS Chief,"The general manager of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has again warned that caution is needed when considering central bank digital currencies.  In a speech at the Central Bank of Ireland on Friday, Agustin Carstens said that central banks today ""are not seeing the value"" of venturing into the unknown when it comes to issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC), as such a move could bring fundamental changes to both financial stability and the monetary system.  The current monetary system, he explained, consists of two tiers – the customer-facing banking system and the central bank – which both work together. However, with a CBDC, the deposit and lending business would shift from commercial banks to central banks, producing a one-tier system  Carstens continued:  ""There are historical instances of one-tier systems where the central bank did everything. In the socialist economies before the fall of the Berlin Wall, the central bank was also the commercial bank. But I do not think we can hold up that system as something that will serve customers better.""  At times of financial stress, money tends to move away from banks that are seen as high risk towards banks that are considered more secure, the BIS chief continued. Therefore, it is ""not far-fetched"" to picture a scenario in which a CBDC could command a premium over a fiat currency. For example: ""where one euro of deposits in the commercial bank buys less than one euro’s worth of central bank digital currency,"" Carstens said.  A central bank digital currency would also impact the monetary policy environment, he said, adding that it would “change the demand for base money and its composition in unpredictable ways.”  Furthermore, with demand for cash still high in most countries, there is “no urgency” to come up with a substitute for cash in the form of a CBDC, Carstens said, adding that the technology is also still “broadly untested.”  As a result of all these uncertainties, central banks prefer to “tread cautiously” into the area of CBDCs. “Before we open up the patient for major surgery, we need to understand the full consequences of what we’re doing,” Carstens cautioned.  He stated:  “So far, experiments have not shown that new technologies would work any better than existing ones. There is no clear demand for CBDCs on the part of society. There are huge operational consequences for central banks in implementing monetary policy and implications for the stability of the financial system.”  Last July, the BIS head predicted a bad ending for cryptocurrencies, saying that they represent “a bubble, a Ponzi scheme and an environmental disaster.” And in February 2018, Carstens warned that cryptocurrencies could become “parasites” on the financial system. He also claimed that cryptocurrencies are “not sustainable as money,” adding that they fail to meet the “basic textbook definition” of a currency.  Earlier this month, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, part of the BIS, also warned that the growth of cryptocurrencies poses a number of risks to banks and global financial stability.

42430322,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMrGBh,1553504426,R3 Co-Founder Jesse Edwards Is Leaving the Enterprise Blockchain Firm,"Jesse Edwards, one of the co-founders of R3, has left the enterprise blockchain company, CoinDesk has learned.  Edwards, a former Sandler O’Neill investment banker, helped found R3 back in 2014 with CEO David Rutter and ex–Standard Chartered executive Todd McDonald.  In a statement provided by R3 to CoinDesk, Edwards said:  “It’s true that my work here is done and it is time to move on. This has been one of the best experiences of my professional career, and I am incredibly privileged to have worked alongside such a talented and passionate team in building this business. R3 has broken away as the market leader and standout partner of choice for professionals looking to apply this technology to their industries. I couldn’t be prouder.”  His departure appears related to a strategic difference over how to spur investment in startups that build on top of Corda, R3’s blockchain fabric and base for running open-source applications.  Edwards, who was heavily involved in getting R3’s initial funding in place, had been working at R3 on “a side fund targeted for $50 million to $60 million,” similar in kind to the various funds for Dfinity and Tezos, according to a source who wanted to remain nameless. “Adroc was the name of the fund (which is Corda spelled backwards),” the source added.  Instead, R3’s board has opted for what it called “an internal corporate development function,” which the company said will be tasked with supporting early-stage companies building on the Corda platform, and also explore a variety of potential joint ventures, acquisitions, and related activities focused on later-stage companies.  Still, Edwards had long wanted ""to set up his own independent investment shop, one dedicated to driving Corda adoption globally,"" R3 said in a statement.  As such, R3 and Edwards have decided “it made sense for him to explore his own path, which we fully support,” said the company said. “Jesse remains an investor in and a close friend of the firm, and we look forward to working with him closely in the future.”  More streamlined  R3 said in its statement the firm had indeed earlier explored the idea of launching an outside fund built with R3 capital and supplemented with third-party investment focused on the same goals with early-stage companies.  “Yet after careful consideration, and especially in light of the financial strength of R3, we determined that we would accomplish these objectives more rapidly and with a more streamlined process by doing it ourselves,” the company said.

42430342,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMrGlh,1553482837,"Sand, Death and Cryptocurrency: Life in a Decentralized Syria","Rachel-Rose O'Leary is a reporter at CoinDesk, covering how cryptocurrencies are being used in areas of economic, social and political unrest.  This article is part of her ongoing dispatches from Rojova, Syria.      I’m writing from the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria.  Known to sympathizers simply as Rojava – meaning West – the predominantly Kurdish region revolted against the Syrian regime in 2012 and achieved its de-facto autonomy as a result.  Since then, it has pioneered a new political model named democratic confederalism, which due to its stateless, decentralized nature, has a natural synergy with blockchain technologies – something that has been a point of research by technologists in the region.  That’s partially why I am here.  I’m also here because, in December, U.S. President Donald Trump announced his retreat from the region, cited the impending defeat of ISIS, and denouncing Syria as the land of endless wars – of “sand and death,” he called it.  The withdrawal has now effectively been reversed, but at the time, many believed Turkey, which shares a border with Northern Syria, would attack (the country has engaged a continuous offensive against the region since 2016).  The concern was that if Turkey seized control, Rojava’s political system would crumble to the totalizing power of nation states. There would be no more resistance, a resistance I've come to care greatly about.  I had previously written about the potential of blockchain and cryptocurrency in Rojava. I felt that while the region lacks the basic security and resources offered by the West, it has something the West doesn’t have – the opportunity for a new system of governance to be realized.  With this in mind, I spent a little over a month trying to get into the country to volunteer my skills, both in media and crypto, to a new network of technological academies being developed in the region.  On February 25, I arrived at my new home. Here, according to critics, in the process of implementing democratic confederalism, Rojava has succumbed to the pressures of the familiar, whereby the structures of capitalism and its hierarchies are being mimicked in local economies.  Erselan Serdem, the leader of Rojava’s technological development program, would like to redeem this, creating structures that allow ecological, egalitarian economies to thrive – what proponents call ""democratic modernity.""  According to Serdem, with the right combination of philosophy and tech, this dream can be realized.  “We are talking about a new form of institution with a high level of technology, that can develop useful tools for society and achieve a good relationship to nature – that’s our aspiration,” Serdem said, adding:  “Decentralized institutions can be supported by parallel, decentralized technologies.”  War vets and social engineers  The academies Serdem is building will be used to train hackers in various decentralized technologies.  For instance, participants will research digital governance, cryptocurrency and blockchain solutions to fairly distribute natural resources. Serdem is still recruiting people into the academies, seeking out those with technical skills across Rojava and also training injured war veterans, starting with basic programming skills.  Currently, there are 30 war vet participants in the program.  Not only is Serdem recruiting throughout Northern Syria, but he's also enlisting what he calls ""social engineers"" – politically-oriented hackers and philosophers focused on reshaping technology.  Without these folks, Serdem said, “We have seen how history repeats itself. The current system will have the same destiny.""  Hozan Mamo, a software developer and academy member, echoed what Serdem said, telling CoinDesk through a translator that the technological academies could solve problems that have emerged in civil society.  For instance, he continued, decentralized governance tools could help formalize decision making and keep power in check.  On the other hand, cryptocurrency could be useful as well, Mamo said, since there's no access to electronic transactions in Rojava. Instead, Rojava’s inhabitants are dependant on cash that is issued by the Syria state – meaning that the region is still economically bound to the regime.  As a first step towards that, Mamo is looking into the feasibility of onboarding local merchants to accepting cryptocurrency.  The ethos of crypto  Still, there's a good amount of cynicism surrounding the project.  In Rojava, technology has mostly shown its face through social media, and a sudden proliferation of smartphones – mostly carrying Facebook, YouTube and Whatsapp – has had a tangible impact on the social sphere.  The obsessive use of smartphones has led a certain suspicion of technology to develop, which could have a negative impact on the adoption of blockchain and cryptocurrency technology.  In an effort to combat this, Serdem noted, he intends to use the academies to redefine technology, moving the narrative away from the corporate interest groups that have monopolized social media, network infrastructure and even hardware in the region.  “There are different forms of technology,” he said. “[There is] technology by nation states and the companies, and then there is a resistance movement, that try to discover more ideas against the current system.”  Bitcoin and other decentralized technologies, for instance, qualify as this ""resistance tech"" – tools developed by oppressed people to take back power throughout history. Within the academies, Serdem would like to see some of this tech, these alternatives, built.  “We can use some of that kind of technology which is created by the resistance movement. Now we are in the beginning, but in the process we will see what forms of technology do we need to have for democratic modernity,"" said Serdem.  Mamo believes that by focusing on usability and security, adoption could happen quickly, especially by younger generations. According to him, Rojava's youth has no shortage of enthusiasm for technology, as well as a strong aptitude for it.  Prior to the revolution, he said, the Syrian regime deliberately held back the development of technology in the region, forbidding its teaching in universities and arresting people that tried to develop their skills.  But the revolution “opened the border” to technology, he said, leading the region to develop rapidly.  Openness to technology isn't the only thing Serdem and others are trying to push. His academies also have a strong focus on philosophy, specifically the writings of Abdullah Ocalan, the incarcerated political philosopher whose writings inspired the Rojava revolution.  In his writings, Ocalan seeks to fundamentally restructure society by challenging the roots of hierarchy and domination that underpin it.  It’s a philosophy that resonates strongly with the ideologies that many crypto advocates hold and even display in their interest and use of the open-source movement.  In this way, Serdem told CoinDesk, the academies will encourage much of the same.  ”We are creating a commune of the technology, to solve technical problems, and at the same time to create the social engineer or the political person in the moral society,"" Serdem said, before concluding:  “In Rojava, we are trying to achieve the philosophy of open source, of how to create a society informed by open source.""
