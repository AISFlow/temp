42385264,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnwRH,1607376205,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Briefly Slips Below $19,000; ETH Locked in DeFi Crosses Over 7M","“Weak longs” might be causing the price to slip in the bitcoin market but ether locked in DeFi is back on the upswing.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $19,067 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 0.68% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $18,923-$19,433 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC below its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bearish signal for market technicians.    A fairly tepid market Monday opened the week, keeping bitcoin’s price in a range betweent $19,200 and $19,400 until traders began hitting the sell button around 18:00 UTC (1 p.m. ET). At that time, the price per 1 BTC went as low as $18,923 and was at $19,067 as of press time, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      “The market has come a long way in a relatively short space of time,” said Rupert Douglas, head of institutional sales for brokerage Koine. “Bigger picture, the market is headed higher but I am expecting lower prices first, maybe to around $13,700 to flush out the weak longs at some stage.”      “Weak longs” are certainly being shaken out. Over $16 million in sell liquidations on derivatives venue BitMEX occurred over the past three days, which has made up 72% of $22 million total automated margin calls it had over that time period.      Much like a margin call, a “sell liquidation” on BitMEX happens when prices fall, forcing leveraged longs to close out their position.      While BitMEX’s influence has indeed waned over the course of 2020 due to regulatory quagmires, sell liquidations on the exchange still help reinforce Douglas’ market thesis.      “There is a lull in the market as a whole,” said Constantin Kogan, a partner at crypto investment firm Wave Financial and a mega-bull on bitcoin. “MicroStrategy invested another $50 million in bitcoin at a rate above $19,000, so the sentiment is still positive.”      Read More: MicroStrategy Buys Additional $50M in Bitcoin      “Bitcoin is consolidating under its all-time high resistance with volatility compressing to pre-uptrend levels,” said Cindy Leow, portfolio manager of multi-strategy crypto firm 256 Capital. Indeed, volatility is dipping ever so slightly after a steady upward trend.      “We see a return to mean reversion, with bitcoin ranging steadily between $17,000 and $20,000,” Leow added. The last time bitcoin traded at $17,000 was back on Nov. 17, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      Cashing out winning positions was the preferred narrative of analysts Friday, and Leow also concurs.      “We continue to remain short-term cautious mainly due to potential year-end outflows and seasonal factors,” she said. “We anticipate heavy profit-taking from marked-up books and positions unwinding.”      Some rotation into other crypto assets, known colloquially as “alts” and particularly in the Ethereum ecosystem, also seems to be a trend, Leow said. “A neutral scenario is for the rest of the year that we remain within this range while profits from BTC recycle into alts.”    ETH locked in DeFi on uptrend, again    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was down Monday, trading around $586 and slipping 1.5% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Read More: Bequant, Global Digital Finance Look to Create Best Practices for DeFi      The amount of ether “locked” in decentralized finance (DeFi) is now over 7 million ETH, worth $4.1 billion as of press time. It’s an uptrend in December after a November where total value locked, or TVL, dropped to as low as 6.6 million ether.      Analysts say market dynamics are in play as traders clearly had been rotating ether out of DeFi but now seem to be plowing back in.      “One contributing factor can be simply that BTC was outperforming ETH in November,” noted Jake Brukhman, chief executive officer of investment firm CoinFund.      256 Capital’s Leow also noted that excitement around DeFi might be back on the upswing. “While bitcoin rests just shy of all-time highs, DeFi blue-chip tokens are bouncing again on the back of Eth 2.0's announcements and general market excitement around DeFi partnerships,” Leow told CoinDesk.

42385266,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnw5t,1607374975,Blockchain-Based Immunity Passports Don't Resolve Core Privacy Issues: Report,"Existing decentralized digital identity standards are vulnerable to compromise and do not have privacy at their core: This is the central argument posed by a new paper presented by Harry Halpin, a visiting professor at research university KU Leuven, at the Mozilla-hosted Security Standardization Research Conference (SSR20).      Proposals for vaccine or immunity passports, which would tie a person's movements to their COVID-19 immunity status, have resurfaced with promising news about vaccines. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) announced it’s ""in the final development phase"" of a digital passport app that would receive and verify if someone has received a COVID-19 vaccine. The app would purportedly use blockchain technology to authenticate data without storing in a centralized manner. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization is looking at possible ""e-vaccination certificates"" for travel.      ""Identity systems based on globally unique identifiers are by nature against privacy, and putting them on a blockchain does not change this fundamental dichotomy,” said Halpin, the author of the paper “Vision: A Critique of Immunity Passports and W3C Decentralized Identifiers” and the CEO of NYM, a privacy startup developing a mixnet.      “In fact, putting this data on a blockchain tends to make privacy problems worse, and it's not clear that hand-waving about zero-knowledge proofs really changes the situation.""    Vaccine or immunity passports    The idea of immunity passports has been around for months. The idea is that if someone had COVID-19, they would be immune for a period of time and could have their status verified digitally. The concerns with such proposals are numerous, including the ways such sensitive information is stored, how it’s verified and how it curtails or impacts upon people’s rights.      Countries such as Chile and El Salvador have, in fact, pursued such measures. Chile’s passes, for example, exempt from quarantine those who have recovered from COVID-19 or tested positive for the presence of antibodies, letting them return to work, according to the Washington Post. Residents of Chile could apply for these passports if they haven’t shown symptoms for the disease and they’re willing to be tested.      The ID2020 Alliance, a public-private partnership with partners including Microsoft, Accenture and Hyperledger, has already begun to certify some ID proposals as a “good ID” to offer to governments. A certification means the technology complies with 41 technical requirements put forward by ID2020.      Read more: Immunity Passes Explained: Should We Worry About Privacy?      The COVID-19 Credentials Initiative (CCI) is another group composed of more than 300 people from 100 organizations looking to “deploy and/or help to deploy privacy-preserving verifiable credential projects in order to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and strengthen our societies and economies.” The project looks for instances where Verifiable Credentials (VCs), the digital equivalent of a driver's license, could be used to address the public health crisis. At their heart, VCs show the minimum amount of information an entity might need to allow them, say, access to a workspace amid a pandemic, while limiting which other kinds of information are shared.      Vaccines present both a new opportunity as well as new questions regarding data privacy and sensitivity when it comes to any form of pass. But as Halpin notes in the paper, “the most prominent immunity passport schemes have involved a stack of little-known standards, such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).”      Halpin argues that immunity credentials “are possibly dangerous as immunity credential holders could become an ‘immunity elite’ with increased social stratification from those without certificates, violating existing laws on discrimination in many countries.”      For example, it’s not hard to imagine wealthy populations being the first to access newly approved vaccines, receive immunity passports or certificates, and therefore gain access to the travel, work and other benefits it would incur.    Decentralized Identifiers, Verifiable Credentials and W3C    The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), a membership-driven standards body, has laid out the standards for DIDs and VCs, upon which many of these privacy-preserving proposals are based. The body is also known for such standards as the early versions of HTML. Halpin contends these standards are flawed in claiming they preserve privacy.      Generally, a digital identity is seen as a unique identifier connected to a set of variables, like a person's name, citizenship or, in this case, immunity status. A goal of many companies in the blockchain space is the creation of a “self-sovereign identity,” which gives people the ability to control the way their identifiers can be accessed by others, without giving up their personal identity or information, as opposed to relying on a centralized government or company.      Read more: From Australia to Norway, Contact Tracing Is Struggling to Meet Expectations      Think of it a bit as a bitcoin wallet address, which lets a user pay you without ever having to know your name, for example. Compare this transaction to sending money to someone’s bank account: The bank needs to know both who you are as well as the individual to whom you’re sending money.      A core part of resolving this problem was that it seemed a central database was needed to resolve or verify these unique identifiers. Blockchain technology seemingly resolved this need by letting information be stored in a decentralized manner, and prompted a resurgence of interest, along with W3C to put forth standards for this idea.    VCs and DIDs: Largely about data integration    At the core of Halpin’s critique of VCs is that they are made for data integration rather than privacy. The standards can be based on the Semantic Web (an extension of the internet based on standards set by the W3C), with the goal of making data readable by machines.      The details of the argument are quite technical but hit on a couple of key points. One is that W3C VCs are basically just signed digital documents. They use a serialization, or the process by which code and data is converted into a form where it can be transmitted, whose only use case is data fusion. Data fusion is the process of integrating data from multiple sources.      In other words, on a technical level, the standards data model isn’t built with privacy at its core. Instead, it’s an optional add-on.      “The Semantic Web is useful for data fusion across databases, which is useful for open public data,” said Halpin. “When you combine the Semantic Web with personal data and globally unique identifiers like DIDs, it conceivably could be used in use cases like tracking down immigrants by the [U.S.] Department of Homeland Security. I honestly can't see any reason why corona test results would be attached to a DID, and the only answer that seems plausible is dangerous data fusion with other sensitive data by governments.""      Read more: COVID-19 ‘Immunity Passport’ Unites 60 Firms on Self-Sovereign ID Project      DHS has awarded a contract to Digital Bazaar to work on the W3C digital identity standards.      Halpin writes that this model based on data integration can be exploited by signature exclusion and signature replacement attacks. In such an attack, a bad actor removes the signature of a signed message or digital document, and replaces it with another signature, thereby tricking a verifier into accepting the invalid message as valid.      What this means is VCs could be tricked into showing they’ve been verified when they are not. In the case of an immunity passport or certificate, this means someone could have such a document verified as accurate when it could be incorrect or even completely fabricated.    Growing dissent    Elizabeth Renieris is a data privacy lawyer and a Technology & Human Rights Fellow at the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School in Cambridge, Mass. She previously co-authored a paper around the ethical, social and technical concerns around COVID-19 immunity passports and resigned from the technical advisory board of ID2020 over concerns about the organization's direction.      According to Renieris, the biggest problem with the DID specifications is they are just a data format, something that’s poorly understood by the community and for profit companies pushing this narrative.      “It does not embed any security protocols or access controls and there is no way to prove that the holder of a credential is even the subject of that credential,” she said in an email. “This opens the door to massive fraud.”      Halpin argues that DIDs are also, by nature, contradictory to privacy. At the heart of arguments about privacy is how to link one entity to an action. If the goal of an adversary is to identify you, then assigning you a globally unique identifier that is reused makes uncovering your identity much easier.      Read more: ‘Decentralized ID at All Costs’: Adviser Quits ID2020 Over Blockchain Fixation      “If you don't use a 'Globally Unique Identifier’ (GUID), you can still get connected to your actions online, it's just a GUID makes it easier,” said Halpin in a message. “A cookie in a browser like Google is a unique identifier that Google assigns to you to link your actions across web pages. With DIDs, you just gave a cookie any company can use. That's fine for some use cases but probably not for sensitive medical data.”    Blockchain doesn’t fix this    The arguments for decentralization and the benefits of blockchain also start to come apart at the seams when considering the permissioned ledgers and centralized servers involved, according to Renieris.      The appeal of blockchain technology is its decentralized nature, immutability and pseudonymous hashes.      But in practical use cases, argues Halpin, it doesn’t fix flaws with the underlying DID and VC standards. Instead, it introduces additional complexities and vulnerabilities.      For example, a paper published in June 2020 laid out a concrete proposal for immunity passports, titled “COVID-19 Antibody Test/Vaccination Certification: There's an app for that.” It describes a distributed ledger called OpenEthereum, a fork of Ethereum by the Open University and run by a consortium.      “In contrast to Ethereum but similar to other DID-based chains like Sovrin, it is based on “proof-of-authority” (i.e., a permissioned blockchain where any validator or quorum of validators may write to the chain, but not other actors like users),” writes Halpin.      Users of the proposed app could choose where to store their data, allegedly revoke their data and delete it if they chose, and store personal information in a hash.      Halpin lays out a number of ways in which these claims leave much to be desired. Letting people choose where to store their data means they could put it on insecure devices such as their smartphones. There is no guarantee data won’t be copied by other systems. And, finally, the system’s data structure creates problems for scaling it, according to Halpin.      “The most concrete immunity passport proposal dangerously puts the hash of personal data on the blockchain. Even the use of blockchain technology by specifying resolution of an on-chain mapping of an identifier to a key in systems like Sovrin ends up being a redirect to centralized servers, undermining a claim of the blockchain promoting decentralization,” wrote Halpin.      “As the use of blockchain technology does not seem necessary for the goals of the immunity passports and likely hinders rather than helps privacy, immunity passports – and more widely both W3C DIDs and VCs – use blockchain for blockchain’s sake.""      Privacy needs to be at the core of such systems, not an optional afterthought, he said.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/12/07/blockchain-based-immunity-passports-dont-resolve-core-privacy-issues-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f4cc3a5ed1645fb6949aa9dea4cdd3b776b683f2-796x599.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385262,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnwOl,1607372513,How One Bitcoin Options Trader Turned $638K Into $4.4M in 5 Weeks,"In the run-up to the 2017 market peak, stories abounded of traders who bought bitcoin in the spot market just a few months before only to cash out to the tune of hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars.      The days of tripling or quadrupling your money in just a week or two just by buying bitcoin may be behind us. But since those heady days of three years ago, the crypto derivatives market has taken up the mantle of being the place where astonishing returns can occasionally be had by taking huge risks.      Indeed, some traders with bullish outlooks have recently generated significant profits by taking long positions using the cheap out-of-the-money call options. That has given them the same reward as holding multiple bitcoins in the spot market but at a significantly less cost, albeit with more risk.      That's what a bullish call options trade executed five weeks ago on the world's largest crypto options exchange, Deribit, has achieved.      On Oct. 30, someone (a single trader or small group) bought 16,000 January expiry call options at the $36,000 strike for 0.003 bitcoin per contract, according to data shared by Deribit. The total cost was 48 bitcoin – the number of contracts (16,000) multiplied by the per-contract premium of 0.003 bitcoin.      In dollar terms, the per-contract premium at the time was around $39.90, and the entire trade required an initial outlay of approximately $638,400.      As bitcoin rallied from $13,400 to over $19,000, the premium drawn by the $36,000-strike January expiry call rose from 0.003 bitcoin to 0.0145 bitcoin, generating a paper profit of more than $4 million.      Here is how the net return is calculated:    = [(Option's current price of 0.0145 BTC x 16,000 contracts) x bitcoin's current spot market price of $19,200] minus (-) cost of trade. = [232 bitcoin x $19,200] - $638,400 = $4,454,400 - $638,400= $3,816,000    If the position were to be liquidated now, and assuming dumping on the market 16,000 far-out-of-the-money calls wouldn’t drop the price, the net return ignoring the fees charged by the exchange would be seven times the initial outlay.      A call option gives the holder the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a particular date. A put option represents a right to sell. Options on Deribit are also cash-settled, which means when they are exercised it is only the profits that are paid. One options contract represents the right to buy or sell one bitcoin.      As of now, the $36,000 call is an out-of-the-money call option – one which has no intrinsic value due to the spot price hovering below the strike price.      Theoretically, the purchase of the $36,000 call expiring on Jan. 29 is a bet that prices will rise above $36,000 before the end of January, making the option ""in-the-money.""    The crypto derivatives market has taken up the mantle of being the place where astonishing returns can occasionally be had by taking huge risks.    However, as markets move higher, the probability of the out-of-the-money option turning into one that is in-the-money rises, boosting the option’s premium, as seen in this case.      If the bull market maintains its pace, the option premium will continue to rise, all things being equal. However, a potential price consolidation would reduce bitcoin's probability of rising above $36,000 by the end of January and erode the option's value as the time to expiration draws near (referred to as “theta decay” in options parlance).      Taking on an options trade brings with it even more risk than just buying bitcoin outright. For one, the trader could get wiped out. That’s because the long call position would expire worthless on Jan. 29, yielding a loss of $638,400 (the total premium the trader paid) if bitcoin settles below $36,000 on that day. Then again, the maximum loss the option trader can suffer is limited to the extent of premium paid, which is $638,400 in this case.      If the trader is seeking to liquidate a little bit of the position now, he or she may have a willing buyer out there near current prices for small amounts. As of now, the $36,000-strike call looks somewhat active. A few other traders seem to have bought call options at that strike price.      ""Options offer a different strategy to make leveraged profit,"" said Shaun Fernando, head of risk and product at Deribit. ""In this case, extremely bullish sentiment could be done through buying leveraged futures. However from trading far out-of-the-money calls, it offered the trader a low-risk, high-reward strategy with limited down side. Increase in option price was as a result of underlying move and increased volatility. Underlying [bitcoin] does not necessarily have to cross the strike for a trader to profit.""      At press time, there are more than 20,000 call option contracts open at the $36,000 strike – that's the highest concentration of open interest at a single strike.      A big open interest buildup in a deep out-of-the-money option is often considered a bullish sign. However, sometimes the data is skewed by a few large trades and thus not reliable as a market indicator, as in this case.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/07/how-one-bitcoin-options-trader-turned-638k-into-44m-in-5-weeks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/45fafdf577d9fbfcdbf749a68ecdbc6c7132b243-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

One source with knowledge of the plans told CoinDesk that BBVA is “launching its Europe-wide crypto initiative from Switzerland.”      “There are still some compliance hurdles so this will not be in December, but I expect they [BBVA] will be live next month,” they added.      Asked if BBVA was building its solution primarily to deal with tokenized securities and the like, the source said: “This is a cryptocurrency offering.”      BBVA said it could not comment.      BBVA is rumored to have integrated the same custody solution for digital assets, called SILO, as Russia’s Gazprombank. (Gazprombank is already live with a crypto offering in Switzerland.)      Read more: Gazprombank Switzerland Executes First Bitcoin Trades, Announces Payments Initiative      About six months ago, BBVA began work on integrating the SILO custody platform built by core banking software provider Avaloq and Swiss crypto specialists METACO, according to the source. METACO is also known to be working on an institutional custody solution with London-headquartered Standard Chartered.      Avaloq and METACO declined to comment.      A second source said the project will likely surface “around Christmas,” adding that there are still regulatory issues to iron out.      “The project has to pass through several processes to get a green light and become a reality,” they said.    Times have changed    BBVA is no stranger to crypto innovation. It was among the first financial institutions to combine public and private blockchains in a live transaction back in July 2018.

Bond concept Standard Chartered Bank and UnionBank of the Philippines said they have completed another proof-of-concept blockchain bond issuance, meant to reduce the barrier of entry to the bond market for retail investors.

Blockchain R&D The Singapore government has launched a S$12 million (US$8.99 million) program to advance commercial applications of blockchain within the city-state. Under the nation’s National Research Foundation (NRF), the Singapore Blockchain Innovation Programme will work with multinational corporations, large enterprises and IT firms to research and develop with 17 blockchain-based projects, to help the city-state become “more globally connected,” especially in the time of coronavirus.

Cross-border CBDC Hong Kong’s central bank is reportedly working with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) to test digital yuan use cases. PBOC’s Digital Currency Institute and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority are discussing the technical pilot testing of using a digital currency for making cross-border payments. “As the renminbi is already in use in Hong Kong and the status of e-CNY is the same as cash in circulation,” an HKMA executive said. “It will certainly offer an additional payment option to those in Hong Kong and the mainland who need to make cross-border consumption.”      Mining revenue Bitcoin miners generated an estimated $522 million in revenue in November, up 48% from October and the highest since late 2019, according to data from Coin Metrics. The sharp revenue increase came as bitcoin rallied 40% in November. Despite significant intra-year volatility, mining revenue measured by terahash per second (TH/s) is roughly flat year to date from roughly $0.138 per TH/s on Jan 1 to $0.135 per TH/s at last check. Additionally, network fees slightly decreased from October to November – from a $13 average transaction fee at the start of November to below $3 near month’s end.

At stake    Push & pull In just under a year in office as Acting Comptroller of the Currency, Brian Brooks has pushed forward several pieces of guidance favorable to the cryptocurrency industry. In letters and statements, Brooks, former counsel for Coinbase, gave permission for nationally chartered banks to custody crypto, hold dollar reserves for stablecoin issuers and generally created a positive sentiment around the industry. But none of this guidance is binding.      On Friday, U.S. Representative, and chair of the House Financial Services Committee, Maxine Waters published her own letter, calling for President-elect Joe Biden to undo, or monitor, much of Brook’s work.      “As you begin to carry out the mandate given to you by the American people to restore trust in the federal government, I would like to highlight several areas where you and your team should immediately reverse the actions of your predecessors,” she wrote. This would include rescinding crypto and stablecoin services from the banking mandate.      This push and pull seen in government – between the executive and legislative branches, between Democrats and Republicans, and between public guidance and actual law – brings into relief the need for crypto-first industry standards. Whether favorable or skeptical, if a decision comes on from down high it will often lead to complications.      There are several self-regulatory focused groups in crypto, like the Gemini-led Virtual Commodities Association (VCA), as well as industry think tanks like Coin Center, that are doing meaningful work. The latest, a project between Bequant and Global Digital Finance, is looking to create “best practices” around decentralized finance (DeFi).      The companies announced last month they would form an industry group with law firm Hogan Lovells, aiming to bring industry participants together “with the goal of bringing credibility and integrity to DeFi projects around the globe,” according to a press release. Uniform standards can help the industry grow, without running into burdensome regulations.      The need for industry incubated standards is all the more relevant in light of Brooks’ proposals. Recently, the OCC chief proposed that banks be prevented from blacklisting certain politically charged, publicly vilified or legal but “at risk” businesses from banking services.      In a recent CoinDesk op-ed, J.P. Koning came out against the letter, saying that while it’s a noble attempt to stop “politically driven discrimination,” it would likely lead to a loss of diversity in services. “The underlying motivations are good ones,” Koning writes.

Blockstack, a decentralized computing platform that aims to put users in control of their data and identity, launched a token sale in 2019 after filing for the SEC's Regulation A+ crowdfunding exemption, which made the company the first approved to raise capital via a token sale through the securities market.      With the adoption of a fully developed version of the Stacks Blockchain – Stacks Blockchain 2.0, which is anticipated at the end of 2020 or the beginning of 2021 – it means PBC ""will play a significantly reduced role in the Stacks Blockchain ecosystem, and no longer will have the ability to, among other things, unilaterally make changes to the Stacks Blockchain, issue new Stacks [t]okens or otherwise, control or even necessarily influence the development of the Stacks Blockchain 2.0,"" according to documents released by Muneeb Ali, the co-founder and chief executive of Blockstack PBC, on Dec. 7.      ""If true, this is amazing. Unprecedented,"" according to a tweet by Marco Santori, chief legal officer at crypto exchange Kraken.

Still, details remain scant. The MobileCoin Foundation wrote in a brief Medium post that the project is not available to U.S. users or ""persons or entities in other prohibited jurisdictions.""      The project's GitHub repository still describes MobileCoin as in testnet, however. The same is true for MobileCoin's website. That said, the asset is listed on the FTX exchange with founder Sam Bankman-Fried confirming to CoinDesk in an email that ""it's withdrawable mainnet MobileCoin.""      MobileCoin is best known as the cryptocurrency project advised by Moxie Marlinspike, the creator of private messaging app Signal. Marlinspike's involvement was first revealed in a December 2017 story in Wired on the project and its founder, Joshua Goldbard.      ""The two based it on the open-source Stellar Consensus Protocols platform,"" Wired reported at the time.      In May 2018, MobileCoin announced a $30 million round via a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, under a simple agreement for future tokens (SAFT).      In April 2020, the company announced open sourcing of its codebase.      In September, Microsoft wrote about MobileCoin in a blog post, describing how it used the tech giant's Azure technology to encrypt data even while it is being used, which Microsoft refers to as ""confidential computing.""      The MobileCoin Foundation website lists several organizations as members, most of which are nonprofits: The Long Now Foundation, Community Arts Stabilization Trust, Ideas Beyond Borders and Fight for the Future. It also lists storage company Dreamhost and blockchain infrastructure platform Blockdaemon.      MobileCoin's Goldbard did not immediately reply to a request for comment from CoinDesk.      MobileCoin is not the only company to attempt to bring fast and easy payments to mobile. The failed Finney phone from Sirin Labs was meant to do the same. Telegram attempted a similar project after raising $1.7 billion for its Telegram Open Network. Telegram ended its crypto project in May following pushback from U.S. securities regulators.

A court in Paris found the Russian national Vinnik guilty of money laundering, though French prosecutors also charged Vinnik with ""extortion, conspiracy and harming automatic data-processing systems."" They alleged that, in particular, he helped to develop the Locky malware. These other charges were dropped by the court today.      Vinnik was extradited to France from Greece at the beginning of 2020, where he'd been since his 2017 arrest. Vinnink was arrested at a resort near the city of Thessaloniki at the request of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).      The DOJ named him as a mastermind behind one of the first cryptocurrency exchanges, BTC-e, and indicted him on allegations of “computer intrusions and hacking incidents, ransomware scams, identity theft schemes, corrupt public officials and narcotics distribution rings.” The exchange was shut down at the time, with its domain seized by the FBI. The exchange soon reemerged under the name WEX, but went down just one year later.      After Vinnik's arrest, the U.S., Russia and France fought for his extradition, with France ultimately winning. The U.S. is still seeking to get Vinnik, said attorney Frederic Belot, who represents Vinnik. He declined to explain how this could be achieved.    Strategy disputes    Belot believes Vinnik had a chance for total acquittal if he participated in the court investigation during this year. He chose not to do so on the advice of his other two lawyers, Zoe Konstantopoulou and Ariane Zimra, who had been working with the defendant before Belot joined the case, Belot said.      Belot said all the proof of Vinnik's criminal behavior was provided to the French prosecutor by the FBI. The authenticity of those documents could have been contested if Vinnik took a more active role in the investigative process.      ""Alexander decided to keep silent and not to ask anything or reply to any questions of the judge. And the consequence we can see is that Alexander is sentenced guilty,"" Belot said.      Zimra told CoinDesk that Vinnik, on the contrary, ""wanted to cooperate very much and said so,"" but he didn't have access to his file in Russian, his native language, so he ""couldn’t defend himself nor know what was held against him."" Zimra did not clarify if Vinnik actually responded to questions from the court or not.      According to Zimra, Vinnik has two kids in Russia and his wife died of cancer on Nov. 11.

42385256,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnwIT,1607353204,"Crypto Exchange Bittrex Global Lists Tokenized Apple, Amazon, Tesla Stocks for Trading","Bittrex Global has launched trading in tokenized stocks such as Apple, Tesla and Amazon on its digital asset exchange.    The platform said traders and investors will have direct access to listed companies – also including Google, Facebook, Netflix, Pfizer and others – without having to use an external broker or pay additional fees.  Launched in a collaboration with DigitalAssets.AG, the tokenized shares can be purchased in fractions using either U.S. dollars, tether and bitcoin. The listings also open up access in countries without access to U.S. stock markets, Bittrex said.  Traditional clearing systems ""are inefficient and complex and trading small volumes can be expensive and take days, all of which is totally unnecessary given the technological advances that have been made in the last decade,” said Bittrex CEO Tom Albright.  Tokenized stocks looks to be growing trend among cryptocurrency firms. In October, crypto derivatives exchange FTX announced it would allow users of the exchange to register to trade on over 12 equity and cryptocurrency pairs.  And stablecoin platform Terra announced last week the launch of the Mirror Protocol, a way to mint crypto assets that mimic the value of shares in publicly traded companies.  To be clear, Bittrex is not listing actual company shares, but digital assets ""backed 1:1 to traditional stocks, entitling holders to the same economic benefits of owning the underlying stock.""  Bittrex said its stock tokenization initiative is the first step towards creating more accessible markets where securitized token offerings can harness more mature and varied investors.  In future, the company plans to bring exposure to exchange-traded funds, indices and other asset classes.

42385263,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnwQ1,1607349379,First Mover: Why Mohamed El-Erian Might Have Held Bitcoin at $19K,"Bitcoin was lower, staying in the past week's range of roughly $18,500 to $19,700. Prices are up 167% year to date, having started off 2020 at around $7,160.      ""There is no doubt that $20,000 remains a barrier, both from a technical perspective and on an ideological level,"" Simon Peters, an analyst for the trading platform eToro, wrote Monday in an email.      In traditional markets, European shares fell, led by banks and retailers. U.S. stock futures pointed to a lower open as investors worried a coronavirus resurgence might weigh on the economic recovery. The British pound slid 1.5% against the dollar on concern Brexit talks might collapse. Gold weakened 0.4% to $1,831 an ounce.    Market moves    It's the question everyone's asking: With bitcoin prices nearly tripling this year and reaching a new all-time high of $19,920, is it too late for investors to jump in, or is the rally just beginning?      ""Attention is starting to shift towards analyzing where we are in the market cycle,"" the cryptocurrency research firm Coin Metrics wrote last week in a report.      None other than Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser for the German financial firm Allianz, which has €2.3 trillion (US$2.8 billion) of assets under management, tweeted last week that he had sold bitcoin after buying some two years ago at $4,728. The original purchase was made ""not on a deep analysis but rather on the basis of technicals"" as well as to get ""a feel for what's becoming a more popular holding,"" according to the tweet. The decision to sell was ""again not based on any deep analysis,"" he wrote. Based on a rough analysis by First Mover, El-Erian quadrupled his money on the round trip.      But one traditional finance guy using admittedly cursory analysis does not a market make. A lot of cryptocurrency analysts and investors are convinced that now's not the time to take profits on bitcoin, even after its market capitalization surged this year to more than $350 billion.      Last week, Kraken Intelligence, a research unit of the digital-asset exchange Kraken, published results of a survey noting that clients expect an average bitcoin price of $36,602 in 2021, nearly double the current level.      As discussed previously in First Mover, one of the problems with valuing bitcoin is that the cryptocurrency was just invented 11 years ago, so there's no deep history of reliable analytical factors to key off, such as the stock market's price-to-earnings ratios, bond-market yield comparisons or even the supply-and-demand forecasts used in commodities.      So it's impossible to say whether the latest price levels represent nosebleed levels or are more akin to an oxygen-rich hyperbaric chamber.      Greg Cipolaro, global head of research for NYDIG, an investment firm that recently raised $150 million for two new cryptocurrency funds, has co-authored a report with Ross Stevens, the firm's co-founder and executive chairman, arguing that growth in the Bitcoin network could justify a price range of $51,611 to $118,544 in five years.      The forecast relies on Metcalfe's Law, which according to Wikipedia, is attributed to Robert Metcalfe, an Internet pioneer who now serves as a University of Texas professor of innovation and entrepreneurship.      As summarized by the NYDIG report, Metcalfe's Law ""states that a network's value is proportional to the square of the number of its users.""      ""Given our view that, as an emergent successful money, bitcoin's fundamental value derives from its network effects, bitcoin's value should roughly adhere to Metcalfe's Law,"" the authors wrote. ""This may be an important insight for investment professionals who, understandably, require anchoring around a fundamental valuation framework as a necessary component of their allocation diligence and analysis.""      So far, according to the report, the valuation metric appears uncannily accurate:      Of course, nobody knows the future, no matter how confident they sound.      And NYDIG's price projection does require assumptions about how fast bitcoin's network grows during the first half of the 2020s. Over the past 12 months, the number of Bitcoin addresses has grown by 18%. So the authors assume growth rates of 5% to 25% over the coming years.      ""The reality is that there are many potential future growth rates, and we truly have no idea where growth rates will land,"" according to Cipolaro and Stevens. They added a ""reminder that all models are wrong. Some are useful.""      With many investors now simply asking whether bitcoin's failure last week to surpass $20,000 might be due to psychological factors, it can't hurt to be aware of an analytical method that so far has worked pretty well.      - Bradley Keoun    Bitcoin watch    Bitcoin’s price set a new all-time high at $19,920.53 last week. Since then, however, the oldest cryptocurrency has struggled to break above the $20,000 level.      The bull momentum has stalled with large sell orders capping the upside near $20,000, according to some analysts.      ""People are trying to sell at this level based on what happened during the 2017 bull market,"" Simon Chen, executive director of investment and trading at Hong Kong-based crypto lender Babel Finance told CoinDesk. Bitcoin peaked near $20,000 three years ago and fell as low as $6,000 by early February 2016. The bear market ended near $3,200 in December 2018.      Data extracted from the Bitcoin blockchain network backs Chen's analysis. The number of accumulation addresses – a proxy for those who are buying and holding – has dropped to 495,000 from 514,000 over past four weeks, according to data source Glassnode. The decline suggests that some longer-term investors might be taking profits at these price levels.      Accumulation addresses are those that have at least two incoming ""non-dust"" transfers (representing minuscule amounts of bitcoin) and have never spent funds. The metric does not include addresses belonging to miners and exchanges and excludes addresses active more than seven years ago to adjust for lost coins.      The total balance held in these accumulation addresses has dropped to 2.72 million BTC, from more than 2.8 million BTC, in the past two weeks.      According to some analysts, the cryptocurrency needs to make a quick move above $20,000 to avoid a drawdown. ""I think the longer bitcoin continues to reject $19,500 and $20,000 with whale-induced sell-offs, the probability of some more consolidation/correction increases in the near term,"" market analyst Joseph Young tweeted.      - Omkar Godbole    Token Watch    XRP (XRP): Coinbase to support Spark token airdrop to XRP holders (CoinDesk)      Ether (ETH): Grayscale's Sonnenshein sees ""growing conviction around Ethereum as an asset class.""

42433334,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO4Vfh,1607344047,We Don't Need the OCC's 'Political Discrimination' Rule,"Big U.S. banks have long refused to lend to coal miners that use a mountaintop removal technique. Wells Fargo says it prohibits such lending because it recognizes the ""elevated community concerns associated with the practice.""      Should banks like Wells Fargo be allowed to stop lending to an industry because of its impact on the environment or its lack of commitment to social justice? Doesn't Wells Fargo have an obligation to be neutral?    J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and was a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog.  This is the issue at the heart of a recent rule changehttps://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/federal-register/2020/nr-occ-2020-156a.pdf proposed by Brian Brooks, acting head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, or OCC, a key U.S. bank regulator. Brooks and OCC Chief Economist Charles Calamoris want to stop banks from “politically driven discrimination.” Their rule would prevent bankers from using anything other than regular credit and operational criteria for evaluating a company seeking financial services.    The upshot? Wells Fargo would have to re-bank coal miners that practice mountaintop removal. Banks would also be required to restart lending to oil companies involved in exploring Alaska's North Slope, a practice the likes of Wells Fargo, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase have all promised to avoid. Nor would they be allowed to cave in to activists who call for account closures of groups they don't like, say, like Planned Parenthood.      I disagree with the OCC's proposed rule. The underlying motivations are good ones, especially in context of Operation Choke Point (see below). But I don't think the U.S. needs it. It's ironic that, in trying to depoliticize the banking system, the OCC is likely precluding greater diversity in service providers.    Operation Choke Point    Operation Choke Point was an Obama-era program that tried to sever unfavored industries from the banking system. In 2011 the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, a federal government body that supervises and examines U.S. banks, placed a number of perfectly legal business categories on its ""high-risk"" list.      One of these was payday lending, an industry that is often maligned for preying on a poor clientele. Internal FDIC emails voiced an intent to ""get at payday lending"" and to ""find a way to stop our banks from facilitating payday lending.""    We now have decentralized platforms where vilified but legal companies can go to secure financing.    After several payday lenders sued the FDIC for violating their due process rights (the OCC's Calomiris provided expert testimony), FDIC agreed to settle the dispute. The regulator admitted that “certain employees acted in a manner inconsistent with FDIC policies” and issued a statement reiterating that carrying out its responsibilities rests on ""laws and regulations, not on personal beliefs or political motivations."" And thus Operation Choke Point was shut down.      I think everyone can agree that Operation Choke Point was reprehensible. The core regulatory and central banking layers of the financial system stay must stay neutral. No matter what sorts of legal businesses banks choose as their customers, every bank should be granted equal access to the Federal Reserve's core payments tools. Nor should FDIC officials be able to use its examination powers to favor businesses.    Fair trade bank accounts    The problem with the OCC's new fair access rule is that it has a huge blast radius. Yes, it would prevent future government-run choke points. But it would unnecessarily damage efforts by banks to shape their brands in ways that are designed to satisfy emerging consumer tastes.      The 21st century consumer wants to know more about the provenance of the things they buy. We don't just want tuna, we want dolphin-friendly tuna. We don't just want coffee, we want fair trade coffee. And we don't want our T-shirts to be made in sweatshops with Xinjiang-grown cotton. We want ethical T-shirts.      See also: J.P. Koning - The Standard About to Revolutionize Payments      This shift in consumer spending has migrated into finance. Think socially responsible indexes, green exchange-traded funds and activist investing. We see it in gold markets, too. The world's main trading venue, the London Bullion Market, has set up a responsible supply chain that requires refiners to verify that miners safely use mercury and are not involved in human rights abuse.      In banking, loans are the fodder for creating safe deposits. So if a bank wants to attract modern consumers by setting up a clean supply chain (aka fair trade bank account) that means pruning source material for deposits, say coal miner loans.      But the OCC’s rule would block the entrance of this new consumerism into banking.    Is banking special?    The argument against allowing fair trade bank accounts is that “banking is special.” Brooks and Calomiris argue that government chartering and direct access to the Federal Reserve obligate banks to provide services to all companies. And so America must do without the banking versions of dolphin-safe tuna and organic milk.      But this downplays the competitiveness of the U.S. banking system.      If Wells Fargo chooses to avoid making a profitable loan to an Alaskan oil explorer because it wants to greenify its deposits, then Bank of America, Regions Financial or any other bank that isn't quite so concerned will swoop in, make the loan and gobble up the forgone profits.      See also: J.P. Koning - The Dark Future Where Payments Are Politicized and Bitcoin Wins      Nor are banks the only source of financing for firms. The U.S. has some of the deepest capital markets in the world. Our Alaskan explorer can issue commercial paper, junk bonds or equity. Or perhaps some enterprising intermediary, say a private equity firm, will find a way to break the Alaskan oil embargo by borrowing from Wells Fargo and lending the funds to the blacklisted entity.      Lastly, we don't live in the same world we did five years ago. With the emergence of public blockchains like Ethereum, we now have decentralized platforms where vilified but legal companies can go to secure financing. Just create a token approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission and list it on a decentralized exchange. Voila, arctic oil drilling bought and paid for.      For those worried about accessibility, we don't need the OCC's new rule. To guard against future government-sponsored choke points, payday lenders have already demonstrated the best defense: the justice system. The OCC’s rule would only stifle the ability of banks to create new products for today's discriminating customer. Surely, American finance is rich and diverse enough to handle fair trade bank accounts.",NEUTRAL,없음,COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,JP Koning,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/12/07/we-dont-need-the-occs-political-discrimination-rule,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fb88b083236036715a2200b70afa4ad58b61fcbb-1420x891.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a report by the Bangkok Post on Monday, the department will implement a system to make tax receipt collection more efficient rather than raising taxes.      The Excise Department, which falls under the purview of the country's Ministry of Finance, is responsible for taxes on sales of certain goods and commodities manufactured or sold in the country.      Lavaron Sangsnit, the department's director-general, said raising existing taxes would risk hindering Thailand's economic recovery, so instead the department looked for different ways to meet the finance ministry's tax targets.      Blockchain technology will be employed for the purpose of tax revenue collection for the 2021 fiscal year, he said.      The nation's two other tax agencies, the Revenue Department and Customs Department, will also start rolling out blockchain systems in their operations, according to the report.      See also: Thai Central Bank’s New Blockchain-Enabled Bond Infrastructure Passes Test With $1.6B Bond Sale      Lavaron said tax evasion would be a lot harder with the blockchain integrations because the three departments will be able to coordinate when conducting tax audits.

The companies announced last month they would form an industry group with law firm Hogan Lovells, aiming to bring industry participants together “with the goal of bringing credibility and integrity to DeFi projects around the globe,” according to a press release.      Denis Vinokourov, Bequant’s head of research and one of the working group’s chairs, told CoinDesk the group has its roots in how the broader crypto industry has grown over the years. Creating some best practices might help ensure that regulators don't feel the need to impose overly strict rules on the space by cleaning up malicious actors or reducing the amount of buggy code.      “Over the years, [the crypto market has] gradually matured and I think DeFi just wants to go through the same evolution,” he said.      The process likely won’t be straightforward. Vinokourov noted the DeFi space has a number of different services – such as lending or custodian services – that would need unique practices and standards.      In his view, DeFi projects have the potential to “upend the traditional financial system” but this potential suffers from the sheer number of projects that lose funds due to vulnerabilities or malicious actors.      Uniform standards can help solve this problem.      Vinokourov said his biggest goal is supporting stablecoin stability, referring to those cryptocurrencies’ whose prices are theoretically pegged to a fiat currency.      Products like flash loans, which could use stablecoins to conduct some transactions, “have exposed the instability” of some DeFi projects, he said. While most of these coins’ prices usually revert back to a mean price of $1, these tokens should be able to handle the stresses of capital entering or exiting a project without volatility.      Just last month, two DeFi projects saw flash loan attacks, leading to users losing some $13 million. Multiple stablecoins were involved – the Origin Dollar was used in a ""rebase"" attack, while Value DeFi saw attackers arbitraging dai and USDC.      Combating this type of price fluctuation is difficult, and Vinokourov said he didn’t know what the best way to address it may be, though he has some ideas.      “More audits, stricter audits, you know, just like in the traditional space you don't really want to invest in a company that's not been audited,” he said. “Same with crypto protocols. Again, [have] a code of conduct, make sure that everything is in order. It doesn't mean that things can’t go wrong but there's probably less chance of it going wrong.”",POSITIVE,없음,FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | SPONSORED | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/07/bequant-global-digital-finance-look-to-create-best-practices-for-defi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ed9a893d410e4e6b606002cea0613a7cb74a1ad2-1500x997.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
