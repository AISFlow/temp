42399036,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbi8Fl,1464216243,Goldman Sachs: Blockchain Tech Could Save Capital Markets $6 Billion a Year,"A new report from Goldman Sachs Investment Research projects that the implementation of blockchain technology could streamline the clearing and settlement of cash securities, saving capital markets $2bn in the US and $6bn globally on an annual basis.  The figures are supported by breakdowns of the specific market areas where Goldman Sachs sees the technology as valuable, as it projects up to $900m could be saved in reduced personnel and $700m could be saved from IT systems improvements.      The report indicated that this projection is further limited to cash securities – specifically, equities, repo and leveraged loans – and that the savings could be greater. For example, Goldman Sachs foresees applications of the technology eliminating significant additional costs across the foreign exchange (FX), commodities and OTC derivatives markets.              Such estimates were part of a more than 80-page report issued by the multinational investment bank, which also provided estimates for the potential cost savings that could be reaped by organizations who use alternative implementations of the technology.  For example, it sees the use of blockchain-based identity management as creating up to $9bn in cost savings through 2020 in the peer-to-peer lodging industry by enabling the guests and hosts necessary to such business models to better manage disputes.  Elsewhere, the report examined the blockchain’s potential role in US energy markets, anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) compliance and in underwriting title insurance.  In addition to those three industries, the authors indicate that a $2.5bn to $7bn annual market could be developed by incumbents or innovators who help independent energy companies reach new markets. In compliance, it sees blockchain playing a role in reducing suspicious transactions, generating between $3bn and $5bn in cost savings. Finally, title insurance would see between $2bn and $4bn in savings through reductions in errors and manual processes.  However, most notably, the report called for a broadening in how blockchain technology should be characterized as a business opportunity, arguing that prior public statements on its potential have been perhaps too narrowly defined.  The report’s authors state:  ""A key takeaway across these applications is that blockchain is not just about disintermediating the middleman. In some cases, blockchain could disrupt markets and existing participants, while in others, it promises to help drive cost savings by reducing labor-intensive processes and eliminating duplicate effort.""  Overall, the report is the latest sign that Goldman Sachs is watching the industry closely, a development that follows public statements as well as select investments in startups.  To date, Goldman Sachs has participated in a $60m funding round for Digital Asset Holdings, and a $50m fundraising for blockchain-based payments startup Circle.  Cross-industry benefits  Following on its main theme, Goldman Sachs elaborated on areas where it believes blockchain technology can be best applied, again extending this definition beyond one focused on its ability to potentially reduce or replace certain market participants.  The researchers voiced their belief that the blockchain is ideally suited for Internet of Things (IoT) transactions, reducing fraud and corruption, increasing transparency, and efficiency in transactions involving multiple parties.  The report also built on the specific business use cases it identified as being beneficial by outlining how existing companies might leverage blockchain technologies in different ways. For example, the authors highlighted how blockchain technology may create new markets, such as enabling sharing economy startups including AirBnB and HomeAway to better manage the reputation of users.  In contrast, it sees the utilities market as one that could be ""redistributed"" with new startups helping to decentralize the power market by connecting local power generators with the ability to better distribute what they generate in real-time markets.  Still, Goldman Sachs sees the biggest potential in blockchain tech’s ability to streamline existing business processes, citing real estate title insurance, cash securities and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance as areas where the blockchain would create new efficiencies for incumbents.  Bitcoin praise  Notably, the report was keen to praise the public bitcoin blockchain as one of the “most appealing” and “novel” features of the new kinds of distributed database architecture the blockchain enables.  However, the researchers project that high-value commercial transactions will mostly be conducted in private distributed ledger environments where ""trust is already established among participants"" and they ""desire transaction privacy"".  ""We believe that the vast majority of commercial blockchain applications – particularly in capital markets – are likely to use private or permissioned blockchains,"" the report reads.  The report also included an overview of both bitcoin and more general blockchain startups, providing an overview of their business models. However, which versions of the technology would best apply to the examples discusses was not elaborated on by the report.  Potential roadblocks  Still, the report argued that four significant challenges would need to be overcome in order for blockchain technology to enable cost savings and revenue opportunities.  These included standards, commercial conflicts and business process differences, privacy and speed and performance.  In the latter case, for example, Goldman Sachs indicated it believes it remains to be seen whether blockchain technology would be appropriate for ""high-speed, high-volume applications"". Despite claims from ecosystem’s innovators that have boasted about progress in this area, the report said that whether these technologies could follow through ""remains a question"" with no immediate answer.  The amount of privacy provided in distributed ledger environments related to commercial transactions was also raised as a point of concern, but the report continued this criticism one step further, noting users of blockchain-based platforms could become concerned about how their distributed ledger-based data is managed.  Goldman Sachs further reiterated recently raised issues about the ability of existing business processes to adapt to distributed ledger environments, framing existing industries as needing to be in the position to adapt to leverage its potential benefits.  The report warns:  ""In many ways, a blockchain database is only as good as the data and business process that underlie it. Failure to reach a consensus among counterparties because of business process or commercial conflicts could significantly slow or even halt blockchain’s adoption.""

42399045,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbi8Lf,1464207996,Can a New Social Operating System Fix The DAO?,"An Ethereum startup led by a Harvard researcher and the founder of blockchain ridesharing startup La’Zooz will submit a proposal to fix perceived governance issues with The DAO this week.  Launched earlier this month, The DAO has quickly become the largest decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) on the Ethereum network, collecting more than $150m worth of the cryptocurrency ether in contributions that could one day be programmatically disseminated to other blockchain startups that meet a threshold of participant approval.  Despite this success, however, the online community quickly went to work dissecting The DAO's proposed governance model, pointing to various issues that could arise relating to taxation, regulation and the incentive methods used to encourage participants.  It’s the latter issue that Backfeed hopes to address with its proposal. In particular, the startup intends to propose that participants approve the migration to a public reputation system that would look to award those who ""positively influence"" its development.  Backfeed intends to apply lessons it learned from its core product, a ""social operating system"" for DAOs on the Ethereum network that re-imagines how participants can be incentivized in a blockchain-based system. To date, Backfeed has launched an online magazine where readers curate a web publication based on communal decision-making.  CEO Matan Field sees his firm’s technology as being broadly applicable to issues that the community has raised in the structure of The DAO.  Field told CoinDesk:  ""I think it’s a complementary thing for The DAO. The DAO has an economic system, but it’s not decentralized, it’s not resilient and it’s not scalable.""  In particular, Field hopes its engagement tech can reduce problems The DAO could face as it begins to allow users to vote on proposed actions.  He cited figures from the BitShares projects, which had made similar attempts at decentralized governance, noting that The DAO could face decision-making issues at present should voting turnout be too low.  But, Field sees Backfeed as having the necessary tools to alleviate this problem given that its tech aims to incentivize users to align with each other in decision-making, rewarding users when they act together, and when those actions are deemed to have a positive impact on all users.  From democracy to meritocracy  More specifically, Backfeed is planning to introduce a proposal that would see The DAO using its technology to better assess the reputation and contributions of individual members.  To start, Backfeed hopes to help The DAO become better at problem solving, relying less on a ""simple shareholder democracy"" that it believes could produce ""mediocre results"".  Most notably, Backfeed is proposing that influence in The DAO’s decision-making be proportional not to how much users have invested, but in how much what they do positively impacts the decentralized organization.  ""In a decentralized organization, the amount of tokens one holds can’t be the only measure of influence if this organization is interested in fully exploiting crowd wisdom and incentivize positive bottom-up engagement,"" a representative of the company told CoinDesk.  Backfeed contends the proposal could guard against hostile takeovers, while encouraging shareholders with more minority stakes in the DAO to contribute.  Staged rollout  Backfeed, Field said, intends to introduce its plan in two stages, the first of which he says will be announced before the month’s end and introduced to voters.  This will find the startup introducing a reputation system, followed by a second submission that, if approved, would provide what the representative called a ""comprehensive governance scheme"".  ""This second proposal will be an advanced version of the first and expand the reputation system to the entire community, while presenting an incentive mechanism for participation and mutual evaluation,"" the respresentative said.  Overall, Field expects to see this work take two to three months, in which time other proposals for how The DAO can be improved are likely to be introduced. So far, proposals are also under development from the team behind Gnosis, an Ethereum-powered prediction market, as well as other community groups.  Despite this attention, however, Field doesn’t believe that his startup is capitalizing on The DAO’s notoriety. Rather, he argues that his company's work has forced the underlying issues with The DAO to become more apparent and more urgent.  Field concluded:  ""I think the DAO obviously has many dramatic issues and we know how to fix all of them. It will take time, but I think we’ve made most of the progress.""

42399041,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbi8Jh,1464200393,Deloitte to Staff New Blockchain Lab With 50 Developers,"Deloitte is set to rapidly scale its global plans for blockchain services by setting up a new development hub in Ireland.  Announced today, Deloitte has created a financial services blockchain lab in Dublin, and will seek to grow that team to 50 people over the next 18 months. Called the EMEA Financial Services Blockchain Lab, the new development space is part of Deloitte’s FinTech initiative called the 'The Grid', which constitutes a network of labs around the world.  The Dublin team, according to the company, will be tasked with developing blockchain proofs-of-concept into ""functioning"" prototypes. The so-called ""ready to integrate"" solutions will be built with specific clients in mind.  In interview, David Dalton, who co-leads the lab, described the initiative as the first of several experimental spaces of this size focused on blockchain applications.  He told CoinDesk:  ""I think we're unique at this point but I’d expect that to grow globally. In fact that’s our plan.""  Dalton, who is also the head of financial services for Deloitte Ireland, said that there will certainly be challenges to account for when building a team of this size.  He went on to indicate that Deloitte would source the staff both internally and through external hires, with at least a third being drawn from outside the company.  Irish push  In the near-term, the professional services company is looking to kickstart the process by temporarily moving some of its in-house blockchain talent to Dublin. From there, other Deloitte staffers will go through a ""learning and development"" program, said Dalton.  Members of the Dublin lab will work alongside specialist teams in other member firms across the region, such as Deloitte's London-based blockchain team.  The move to open up more development space comes weeks after Deloitte unveiled partnerships with a group of startups focused on blockchain applications, including BlockCypher, Bloq, ConsenSys Enterprise, Loyyal and Stellar.  Deloitte announced the partnerships alongside a suite of 20 blockchain prototypes at CoinDesk's Consensus 2016 conference in New York earlier this month.  Ireland itself is no stranger to work on blockchain applications. Earlier this year, the Bank of Ireland began developing its own blockchain trial for trade reporting. At the time, the bank told CoinDesk that a positive regulatory environment and a desire on the part of regional banks to innovate drove those efforts.  According to Dalton, the existence of “talent on the ground” in Ireland and the nation's “interesting mix of FinTech companies"" was a driving factor in the establishment of the laboratory.

42399040,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbi8Hj,1464191277,Spanish Police Seize 6 Bitcoin Mines in Crackdown on Stolen TV Content,"An investigation by Spanish authorities into the illegal distribution of paid television content has resulted in the seizure and destruction of six bitcoin mines used to launder proceeds from the alleged scheme.  European law enforcement agency Europol, which took part in the investigation, said today that 30 individuals had been arrested during an operation on 18th May. Thirty-eight homes across seven Spanish cities, including Madrid, were searched during the event, according to the agency.  According to Reuters, those operating the bitcoin mines based in Spain were stealing power to fuel those efforts, citing a statement from Spanish police. Discovery of the bitcoin mines reportedly occurred as Spanish tax authorities investigated the alleged scheme.  Mining is an energy intensive process of confirming transactions on bitcoin’s public ledger, the blockchain. Money is made when the proceeds from selling bitcoins (or other cryptocurrencies) exceeds the cost of the electricity used.  Among the items seized: roughly $35,000 in bitcoin, ten luxury vehicles and a private aircraft. Authorities also seized about 184,000 euros, as well as nearly 50,000 decoders used to access otherwise restricted TV content.  Further, a photo included with Europol’s release shows several of the machines seized from one of the mines.  Europol said that the alleged effort to distribute paid-for TV content stretched across the globe, involving decoder exporters from China as well as a network of servers based throughout Europe.  ""This operation shows that these types of crimes are not left unpunished,” Michael Rauschenbach, head of serious and organized crime for Europol, said in a statement.

42399037,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbi8Em,1464187901,KeepKey Prepares for Bitcoin Scaling With Wallet Startup Acquisition,"As developers prepare for the launch of Segregated Witness, a proposed scaling method for the bitcoin network, one startup based in the US has purchased an entire firm to help it prepare for the change.  Hardware wallet firm KeepKey announced today that it has acquired MultiBit, a desktop-based bitcoin wallet program. According to KeepKey founder and CEO Darin Stanchfield, the purchase was aimed at positioning the firm for both the launch of Segregated Witness, known commonly as SegWit, as well as other improvements to the bitcoin network.  He told CoinDesk:  ""All the new plans for the bitcoin protocol, like Segregated Witness, will be integrated. We’re going to begin working on that immediately.""  As part of the acquisition, KeepKey acquires UK-based MultiBit’s clients, software, website, and other forms of intellectual property. To help with the transition, KeepKey plans to hire a new engineer, expanding its team to five full-time employees.  According to Stanchfield, MultiBit was purchased for an undisclosed amount, and that the transaction would be conducted entirely in bitcoin.  Scaling with Segregated Witness  Stanchfield said he expects the handover of MultiBit's assets to be completed by 1st June, a move intended to predate the SegWit launch.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, the proposal is in the final phases of testing, though no clear release date has yet been published by the Bitcoin Core open-source development community.  As for the MultiBit team, outgoing CEO Gary Rowe indicated that those involved with the project would move on to other initiatives, though it's unclear whether those will focused on bitcoin or blockchain-related applications.  ""We are moving on to other projects and are delighted that the KeepKey team have stepped up to continue development of our software,"" he said in a statement. ""Their commitment means that existing users can continue to use bitcoin with confidence.""

42399049,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbi8Pb,1464182353,Japan Enacts Regulation for Digital Currency Exchanges,"The upper house of Japan's national legislature approved a bill on Wednesday to regulate domestic digital currency exchanges, a move that comes nearly two years after discussions about how to regulate the technology first began.  According to a report by The Japan Times, the decision will now require digital currency exchange operators to register with the Financial Services Agency (FSA), the government agency that oversees finance activities in the country. The action also comes with a grace period for businesses affected, as it will not come into force until one year from its approval.  Reports indicated that the measure was passed as part of a larger update to national banking law that sought to boost the domestic FinTech industry. The measures for digital currencies, by contrast, were fueled out of a desire for consumer protection and to prevent payment applications of the technology from assisting in terrorist financing.  In statements, the Japan Blockchain Association (JBA), a regional advocacy group, praised the decision. Yuzo Kano, the organization's chief administrative officer, told CoinDesk:  ""The JBA welcomes this new law and would like the thank the efforts of the lawmakers, FSA and related government agencies, and all other involved parties who helped see this bill through.""  Included in the law are provisions mandating that such firms separate the oversight and management of fiat and virtual currency funds, as well as enforce anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) rules.  Deliberations on the measure began in earnest late last year, when the FSA began openly discussing how it might seek to classify bitcoin under domestic law. The agency eventually settled on the idea that bitcoin represented an “asset-like” or “property” value that echoes its classification by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the US.  The FSA began formulating its plans to regulate bitcoin exchanges in the wake of the collapse of Tokyo-based Mt Gox, the now-defunct exchange service that collapsed just over two years ago.  The decision comes as interest in startups leveraging bitcoin and blockchain technology is growing domestically. In the past month, two local startups received significant venture funding rounds, bitFlyer and TechBureau raising $27m and $6.5m, respectively.  The FSA itself has also become more vocal about the potential benefits of blockchain technologies this year, advocating in statements that the country needs to become a regional leader in its development.

42399048,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbi8Qa,1464175876,Blockchain Startup Develops Identity App with Major Airline IT Firm,"Blockchain startup ShoCard has developed a proof-of-concept focused on digital identity in partnership with a major IT firm that works with the airline industry.  SITA, founded in the late 1940s, provides IT and communication services to the global airline industry, and is ownedhttps://www.sita.aero/about-us/sita-membership/sita-members-a-z by a broad network of major air travel service providers, accounting for roughly 90% of all airlines.  The identity app, dubbed the SITA Digital Traveler Identity App, was formally unveiled today during the Air Transport IT Summit industry conference, held in Barcelona, Spain.  Using a blend of blockchain-based data and facial recognition techniques, the app is aimed at both streamlining how airlines verify passenger identities as well as facilitating real-time data flows at the airport.  With the app, a passenger uploads their travel documents, which are then encrypted and hashed on the bitcoin blockchain. The system provides the passenger with what is called a ""Single Travel Token"", which can be presented to the airline in order to call up those documents using a public key. Any airline terminal connected to this system could then verify the identity of that passenger wherever they present this token.  Though the app is in the early stages, in remarks, representatives for SITA pointed to the project as a means to allow the company test the use of blockchain.  Further, the company indicated its support for new methods for distributing verification data between airline agents who might be separated by hundreds of miles, while at the same time avoiding the problems associated with storing troves of personal information – an attractive feature in an age of digital thieves hunting for exploitable customer data.  Jim Peters, chief technology officer for SITA, said in a statement:  “Blockchain technology offers us the potential to provide a new way of using biometrics. It could enable biometrics to be used across borders, and at all airports, without the passenger’s details being stored by the various authorities. ShoCard has worked with us to demonstrate how we could make this a reality.”  The move comes less than a year after ShoCard raised $1.5m to develop identity solutions using the bitcoin blockchain. At the time, the firm raised capital from a group of investors including AME Cloud Ventures, Digital Currency Group, Enspire Capital and Morado Venture Partners.  Armin Ebrahimi, founder and CEO of ShoCard, argued that the proposed system for verifying airline passenger identities offers a mobile-ready method that also gives customers more control over the data they share.  “With this approach, travelers would be in more control over their personal information, providing what is strictly necessary to verify their identity, all through the convenience of their mobile phone,” he said.
