42376770,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eGOp,1387025158,Polish Web Design Company Pays Salaries in Bitcoin,"Several months after becoming one of the first Poland-based businesses to accept payments in bitcoins, web developer and design company EL Passion made the news again when it offered its employees the chance to receive their salaries either partly or entirely in bitcoins.  The EL Passion website states that:    ""After much interest in the company about bitcoin and crypto-currencies in general, we’ve decided to provide our employees with the choice of having their salaries paid in bitcoin. This makes EL Passion the first company in Poland to pay salaries in bitcoin.      ""Open source is a big part of our company culture, so sending bitcoins peer-to-peer is a logical step forward for us.""    The reaction by the team at EL Passion to the possibility of receiving their salaries in bitcoins was very enthusiastic, more than half of the staff were keen on the idea of getting paid either partially or wholly in bitcoin:  ""Most of the salaries were paid in part in bitcoin, but there were some ... who went for 100% in bitcoin payment.”  Based in Poland’s capital city Warsaw, EL Passion says it chiefly specializes in information architecture and user interface design for web and mobile applications. It develops Ruby on Rails web applications, as well as apps for iOS and Android.  Robert Nasiadek, Head of Mobile and founder of EL Passion, told CoinDesk:  ""I’m a big supporter of cryptocurrency and am very much interested in developing this ecosystem. The first step was to accept payments in bitcoins from our clients. Paying the willing employees in bitcoins seems to be the next natural step.  One of the latest ideas to promote the use of bitcoins among EL Passion’s employees is to show information on the cryptocurrency on the company’s status board, according to its founder.  In addition to this, EL Passion is actively involved in promoting and fostering the wider use of the cryptocurrency in the Polish economy through various activities.  EL Passion hosted several Warsaw Bitcoin Meetups, and also attracted more media visibility for bitcoins by working with Warsaw-based Parking Bar which became the country’s first retail business to accept digital currencies.  ""We’ve already had first payments for our services in bitcoins. We treated the first months as a test period, as we needed to find formal solutions which would allow us to accept bitcoins according to the law, solve all related problems and answer all the questions,” Nasiadek said.  The aim is to become further involved in the cryptocurrency market and work with a larger number of clients who share EL Passions fervour for bitcoins, according to Nasiadek.  Where to spend it?  Since July 2013, when EL Passion started accepting payments in the cryptocurrency, the ranks of bitcoin-friendly Polish companies have further expanded, enabling the web design company’s employees to spend their hard-earned bitcoins at an increasing number of places.  According to data from coinmap.org, in Warsaw and its suburbs there are now 10 businesses accepting bitcoins, and a further 30 companies across the country.  While many of these include a wide range of web-related businesses, other examples include Toruń-based Green Hostel, Wroclaw-based accountancy agency Finesti, and Szczecin-based repair works company Baltic Development.  Spending your bitcoin salary could soon become even easier in Poland, as an innovative project is currently under development by another local company.  In August 2013, Warsaw-based InPay launched a pilot program which is set to boost the use of the cryptocurrency among Poland’s retail outlets.  The company is aiming to introduce digital currency payments in a number of Polish cities by providing retailers with payment terminals. Moreover, InPay say they are also educating retailers on the legal and tax-related aspects of implementing bitcoin payments at their businesses.  InPay provides B2B solutions to restaurants, pubs, coffee houses and stores. In an interview with local news site mambiznes.pl, the company’s owners say that by the end of 2013, they will offer their services free of commission to lure potential customers and increase their trust in digital currencies.  After the pilot phase is completed, InPay aims to set the commission at a maximum of 0.5%.  By October 2013, some 70 local retailers applied to participate in the operator’s bitcoin payment network, according to InPay. On its official website, the company says it is currently implementing the beta versions of its service at Poland-based retail outlets.  The latest developments attest that the digital currency is gaining ground in Poland. According to data obtained from Bitcoincharts, local bitcoin exchange Bitcurex.pl had, on 8th December, a 30-day volume of some 46,912.5 BTC and 94.72m PLN ($31.3m).",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Jaroslaw Adamowski,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/12/14/polish-web-design-company-pays-salaries-in-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/65a60b4f3297de9f7f5d0df77a2f5eb99c01c3a6-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376769,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eGNZ,1387023500,Bitcoin: The Hot Topic at Plug and Play Winter Expo,"The Plug and Play Tech Center startup incubator and accelerator recently hosted its Winter EXPO, with 28 startup pitches, a virtual currency panelist discussion and over 100 investors and corporations.  The virtual currency panel, dubbed the ""Future of Fintech"", was primarily focused on bitcoin. This was particularly relevant, as the audience had just witnessed 11 bitcoin startups pitching their business plans to investors.  Low risk payments and foreign banks  Vinny Lingham of Gyft started the session by talking investors through the primary reasons why his gift card business started utilizing bitcoin.  ""It's a low-risk method of payment,"" said Lingham.  He compared bitcoin to credit card transactions, which can be problematic for a number of reasons. This is especially true with so many different countries operating with different credit card companies.  ""How do you trust a credit card from a foreign bank?"" he asked.  David Chen is an Associate Partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, which recently led an investment of $5m in the exchange BTC China. He believes that it is still early days for virtual currencies like BTC.  ""We’re still in the infrastructure-building stage,"" he said.  And when asked about the current state of bitcoin in China, given the recent central banking news there, he declined to offer any elaboration, saying: ""I think it's dangerous for us to speculate.""  Tip of the iceberg  Chris Larsen is CEO of payment platform Ripple, which he called a ""universal joint"" for virtual currencies. He echoed the sentiment that BTC is just the beginning of something completely new.  ""Virtual currencies are really the tip of the iceberg,"" he said.  It's the concepts that these currencies bring to the table that are so exciting for financial technologies in the future. Larsen cited the confirmation of financial transactions without a central clearing house and a solution to the double-spend problem as the two biggest innovations that bitcoin has brought to market.  Jean-Jacques Cabou, a partner at law firm Perkins Coie, said that over the next few years the issues of navigating regulatory compliance in virtual currencies “will decrease”. He made it clear that any virtual currency-related business should be very transparent.  ""If your bank doesn’t know you’re a bitcoin business, that's a red flag,"" said Cabou.  Distributed infrastructure  David Johnston, who angel invests in virtual currency projects through BitAngels, said that distributed infrastructure is what he is most interested in.  He cited a paper that he recently wrote about the disruptive qualities that distributed systems could present in the future.  He said that 2014 would consist of funding in ""infrastructure level investments: Mastercoin, distributed exchange and distributed commerce"".  The complete panel listing at the fintech session of the Plug and Play EXPO was as follows:  Vinny Lingham, co-founder and CEO of Gyft,  David Chen, associate partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners,  Chris Larsen, founder and CEO of Ripple,  Jean-Jacques Cabou, partner at Perkins Cole, LLP  David Johnston, executive director of BitAngels.  The session was moderated by Adam B.

42376755,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eG7D,1387021548,Entertainment Company Wayi to Become Taiwan's First Bitcoin Exchange,"Taiwanese digital entertainment company Wayi is aiming to become Taiwan's first bitcoin exchange, and announced it will soon begin accepting bitcoin as a payment option on its shopping site.  Wayi International Digital Entertainment, which operates gaming portal Wayi.com.tw and online marketplace Wmall.com.tw, released a statement saying Wmall's new system will launch on 1st January.  Wayi  will be the first large Taiwan-based company to offer this option. Wayi also plans to start Taiwan's first bitcoin exchange service, allowing people to buy bitcoins with local currency.  The latter move is more ambitious, as Wayi says it currently does not hold any bitcoins. The plan is to accumulate a supply from shoppers using bitcoin at Wmall, and then connect with US-based BitPay ""to verify the legality of bitcoin owned by consumers"".  Once it has accumulated a bitcoin supply, the company will start its exchange service, charging customers a 3% fee to trade in their cash. Customers will also be able to exchange their bitcoins back into local currency through digital exchange centers.  In response to the statement, the company’s stock price rallied, reaching the 7% daily upper limit allowed by the Taiwan Stock Exchange.  Wayi’s financial report indicates that the company’s revenue in November dropped 4% from the previous month's level to TWD$41.7m ($1.41m), 22% lower than the same period of the previous year.  Despite mainland China having the world's largest bitcoin exchange and Asia producing most of the world's computer hardware, overall adoption in Eastern Asia has been slower than in other parts of the world.  Taiwan's only exchange option at the moment is LocalBitcoins, and coinmap.org shows only a few local merchants across the region. There has been a high level of interest, however, from each country's tech community and all have small but active enthusiast groups.  This is attributed to a general lack of information available in local languages, fewer connections to the international bitcoin community and its merchant databases, or societies that remain largely cash-based and thus less burdened by credit card hassles.  In Japan's case, there are already a number of yen-based RFID card e-cash options that are widely accepted by stores and function smoothly.  As in other places, Taiwan's regulators have remained mostly quiet on the issue but are watching with interest.  In comments that echoed other central bankers' cautious view of bitcoin, Taiwan's central bank, the Central Bank of the Republic of China's (CBC) Governor Perng Fai-nan said recently the bank ""has been keeping close tabs"" on the development of bitcoin. The bank also said it views bitcoin trading as similar to that of precious metals.
