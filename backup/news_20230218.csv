42414395,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB5NIZ,1676691020,"Bitcoin Soars, Then Retreats: What’s Behind This Week’s Roller Coaster? What’s Ahead?","It’s been a wild week for bitcoin with the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, reaching multiple six-month highs before retreating suddenly late Thursday but then rallying again.  Bitcoin (BTC) was recently trading over $24,557, up almost 3.1% over the past 24 hours and off a weekly high early Thursday when BTC surpassed $25,000 for the first time since August.  The Thursday drop notwithstanding, bitcoin was still changing hands 13% higher than it was seven days ago. The reasons for its rebound from previous support around $22,000, subsequent decline and then rally have varied. They underscore cryptos’ ongoing sensitivity to macroeconomic conditions and industry-specific events, even if BTC sometimes behaved counterintuitively.  Late Tuesday, investor optimism trumped concerns about a stablecoin crackdown and tepid consumer price index (CPI) to send bitcoin, ether and most other cryptos soaring. In an interview with CoinDesk, Riyad Carey, research analyst at crypto data firm Kaiko, said that bitcoin’s upturn was “a bit of a euphoric rally that regulatory issues have cooled off temporarily.”  Earlier in the week, Darius Tabatabai, co-founder of Vertex Protocol, a London-based decentralized exchange, said that “we may have the makings of another bull market,”  A day later, markets turned wary and bitcoin dropped more than $1,000 in a few hours amid hawkish remarks by Federal Reserve officials, the announcement of a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit against disgraced Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon, and a disappointing wholesale prices report suggesting that inflation remained stubbornly resilient.  BTC's “intermediate-term overbought conditions provide a headwind with important resistance around $25,200 nearby, which increases the likelihood of a short-term pullback. Support is near the 200-day [moving average] $20,000,” Katie Stockton, founder of technical analysis-based research firm Fairlead Strategies, wrote to CoinDesk in an email.  Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, noted in an email Friday that “after Bitcoin tested the $25,000 level and failed to extend higher, many active traders locked in profits. Appetite for risky assets might struggle over the short term, which could support a bitcoin consolidation as long as a regulatory crackdown does not take down a key stablecoin or crypto company.”  By Friday afternoon, investors seemed to have shaken off the latest discouraging news to push bitcoin just a few dollars short of $25,000 again. And cryptos continued to outperform equity markets to which they correlated for much of 2022. Ether (ETH), the second-largest crypto in market value, has risen more than 12% over the past week.  Oanda’s Moya believes that the larger outcome of the new U.S. crypto regulatory push won't be apparent for a while, allowing markets to sort themselves out, and that the industry itself remains flush with interesting projects. “There’s always a period when the regulators and lawmakers want to hear from the market that they're going to impact,” Moya told CoinDesk in an interview. “But I haven't seen anything that take away from this market from continuing to grow, to see investment and to have projects done that could hopefully drive the use case argument for it,” he added, although he added that lot of money might leave stablecoins for other types of crypto investments.  To be sure, some observers think that regulatory overreach could drive away investment and spook markets. “Based on their unwillingness to come to the table, it’s clear that the SEC’s motivations of late are being driven by a desire to protect the financial incumbents – that is, Wall Street,” Al Morris, founder of the decentralized publishing protocol Koii Network, told CoinDesk in an email, adding that overly harsh U.S. regulations could benefit other crypto hubs in Europe and Dubai.  Optimism  But investors remained largely optimistic about crypto markets. They see the Federal Reserve approving a second consecutive 25 basis point rate hike at its next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in March instead of returning to the more aggressive increases of 2022. And they hope that any economic contraction will be mild – a so-called safe landing that central bankers are seeking.  “While forecasts of higher rates weigh down on the values of future cash flows, increasing global liquidity is helping raise asset prices,” Lucas Outumuro, head of research at blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock, wrote in a Friday newsletter.  Meanwhile, Moya noted on Thursday that “bitcoin resilience” has been “impressive” given bond market volatility and steady flow of regulation headlines.”  But he added cautiously in a follow-up interview with CoinDesk: “I think we have to live week by week and right now it seems that the main goal is to put consumer protections in place. That will ultimately be where things get fixated on these potential investigations. I think part of the market is also getting used to that type of expectation.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/18/bitcoin-soars-then-retreats-whats-behind-this-weeks-rollercoaster-whats-ahead,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fd2474782577a6a9890662d3cf58f74690a5a35b-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The company is a top 5 producer by exahash capacity and a top 2 producer by breakeven cost. Barring something catastrophic, BITF should be able to scale a BTC position leading up to the halving next year. As Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and many other tokens in the cryptocurrency market have enjoyed a relief rally over the last several weeks, some of the more crypto-focused equity names have had substantial year to date moves. Bitcoin miners have been no exception. Of the larger market capitalized public miners, Bitfarms ( BITF ) has had the best year to date run so far having increased roughly 160% in 2023: YTD (Seeking Alpha) It should be noted for the benefit of full context that all of these companies are down somewhere between 65-70% over the last twelve months and these ytd moves still have all of these shares well off highs. In addition to the larger share price bounce year to date, Bitfarms has also seen a strong reduction in its short position having gone from over 8% of the shares outstanding in late 2022 to 4.5% now: Data by YCharts Compared to the aforementioned peers, Bitfarms now has the smallest short position of the bunch. Sentiment change? Crypto winter has been enormously negative for the publicly traded Bitcoin miners. We've seen serious financial problems plague many of these companies over the last several months. Core Scientific ( OTCPK:CORZQ ) filed Chapter 11. Argo Blockchain ( ARBK ) sold assets and recently announced CEO Peter Wall's resignation. Iris Energy ( IREN ) forfeited machines and Hut 8 ( HUT ) just announced a merger. One could argue if you're a publicly traded miner with some debt and you're still standing, you've probably navigated the climate fairly well and Bitfarms appears to have done exactly that. Miner Profitability (BitInfoCharts) No doubt in part because of the rise in the price of Bitcoin over the last several weeks, we've seen miner profitability improve for the industry broadly speaking. According to a recent report released by Blockware Solutions, Bitfarms is one of the most efficient mining operations in the public market: BTC Breakeven (Blockware Solutions) At a $35.5k breakeven Bitcoin price when factoring in both opex and cost of revenue, only Iris Energy has a cheaper ""all in cost"" for Bitcoin mining. Still, Bitfarms might be the better play at this point because it has consistently had monthly BTC production between 400-500 for the last half year: BTC Production (Company releases) For a variety of different reasons, that hasn't been the case for all of these other companies as Iris, HIVE Blockchain ( HIVE ) and Hut 8 have all seen monthly production decline significantly since last summer. Debt Relief High debt loads have taken their toll on the broader mining space but Bitfarms has navigated that climate very well from where I sit. Last month Bitfarms announced the company was attempting to reduce its debt obligations to BlockFi. The debt was actually through the Backbone Mining Solutions subsidiary, or BMS, and was secured by BTC and mining rigs. Given the climate in the industry, it no longer made sense for BMS to service that debt and default was on the table: The current market value of the assets securing the loan is estimated by BMS to be approximately $5 million, while the outstanding principal and interest is approximately $20 million. A little over a week ago, Bitfarms announced that it had successfully agreed to wipe out $21 million in debt owed to BlockFi through a one time cash payment of $7.75 million. On February 8, 2023, BlockFi retired the BMS loan in its entirety and discharged all further obligations for consideration of $7.75 million in cash. Subsequent to the settlement, all of BMS’ assets, including 6,100 miners, are unencumbered . Bold my emphasis. While this payment was for more than the assets securing the loan were worth, this is a massive win for Bitfarms in my view because the company has reduced debt outstanding from $47 million in mid-January to approximately $25 million today according to the press release. And the company has been able to accomplish that without sacrificing machines or reducing liquidity to a problematic level. Things looked really bad for Bitfarms during the summer. After amassing one of the largest BTC positions of any public miner, the company started dramatically selling off Bitcoin in June: BTC Treasuries (Company filings) Even though the company has a far smaller BTC position than it did last summer, its debt obligations are much more workable having been reduced from $165 million in June to just $25 million now. BITF still has one of the best all in costs for BTC mining and a top 5 exahash production capacity of 4.7 EH/s. Things are looking up. Risks One thing to be aware of is BITF is flirting with a Nasdaq delisting because of a share price down near $1. There is also no guarantee that Bitcoin's price will remain near the current $25k level or even above $20k for that matter. In the event that crypto winter continues for a sustained period of time, Bitfarms will probably struggle with the rest of the industry. Summary But there is a lot to like about Bitfarms right now. The aggressive reduction in debt outstanding over the last 7 months has been impressive. If the broad crypto market rally continues Bitfarms should outperform some of the other leading miners given its low all-in cost compared to peers and its top 5 EH/s capacity. I'm not currently long BITF shares, but it's definitely a name that I think will be worth adding now that the debt story has improved dramatically without costing the company its machines. Crypto has rallied significantly in recent weeks and that has led to some overbought indicators. Being opportunistic with buys is the way to go for the time being, in my view. For the miners specifically, it's very much a race against time as the halving approaches next year. But there aren't very many companies that are positioned as well as BITF is now positioned to benefit from what is likely to be a major upward move in BTC price following the halving.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | MINING | SPONSORED | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4579656-bitfarms-vastly-improved-fundamental-story?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/9567044.jpeg

This is likely caused partly by its manager selling into a crypto bear market. Turning its crypto trusts into ETFs would instantly cure the discounts on these CEFs. There are legitimate business reasons for Grayscale to desire to turn these products into ETFs. Conversion won't happen tomorrow but it could happen in a year or two. I had been slowly building my Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) allocation back up (read more here ). But after the FTX (FTT-USD) implosion, I've become more aggressive in expanding crypto-related holdings. I've also been buying the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ) which I suspect is suffering the same forced selling as its big Bitcoin (BTC-USD) sister fund the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ((GBTC)). The manager of these trusts is under pressure because a subsidiary called Genesis is involved in bankruptcy proceedings. With some regularity, there are reports in the media that Grayscale is trying to raise funds by selling venture investments or even straight up selling its own holdings in the Ethereum Trust. Fellow contributor John Miller has a very good article out that goes into a lot of detail on the Genesis/Grayscale relationship, Grayscale suing the SEC (another important topic) and how it all relates to GBTC. To an extent, it is relevant to ETHE as well: Grayscale is not directly touched in the Genesis restructuring agreement and fears DSG would somehow be forced to unwind any of the Grayscale products, thereby spiking coin supplies, now seem remote. If implemented, the agreement also buys DCG time before it is forced to sell a large portion of its own holdings in the Grayscale products at a discount. DCG along with its other subsidiaries are reportedly holding a billion dollars of the Bitcoin Trust. The refinancing of the May 2023 loans through June 2024 greatly reduces the need for immediate liquidity. It also allows time for the sale of other non-coin assets such as CoinDesk. For good measure, I like and own both GBTC and ETHE. The key reason to like ETHE is that it trades at a $7.55 price per unit vs $16.44 in Ethereum (ETH-USD) holdings per unit. ETHE discount to NAV (Grayscale) That's a massive 55% discount to net asset value. If the price were to appreciate from $7.55 to net asset value, that's a 117% return. Ethereum theoretically doesn't have to appreciate anything to achieve that. Admittedly the discount has only been increasing over the last year or so, but I suspect that's, at least in part, due to the manager liquidating some of its holdings. The discount would instantly close if these closed-end funds were turned into ETFs. So far, the SEC hasn't allowed a non-futures crypto ETF product in U.S. markets. Grayscale is suing the SEC over arbitrarily disallowing this and is actively trying to convert its GBTC product. I also believe it makes business sense to do so, even though you risk losing assets or having to lower the management fee. ETFs attract way more capital than closed-end funds and are easier to get access to for investors across the world. The largest ETF in an asset class tends to attract the most flows. GBTC is already the largest Bitcoin fund in the world and would have a leg-up establishing itself as the prime ETF. This is a must-have spot to fight for, and I think the company will do so. Some will argue the discount will never close because the manager gets a 2.5% management fee on the assets or because the holdings are too complex to allow. I understand these arguments, but the first argument seems outweighed by the opportunity to charge 0.5%-1% on the largest Bitcoin ETF in the world. The second argument doesn't make a lot of sense because, over the years we've seen increasingly complex ETFs make it into the markets. Sometimes these even include esoteric derivatives. One other reason Grayscale may be incentivized to turn these funds into ETFs is that the firm apparently needs money (hence liquidating their ETH holdings). By converting before liquidating they could effectively raise 2x as much money given the deep discount. I do have to say the trade mostly makes sense to some if you believe enough in the long-term of the underlying assets of ETHE or GBTC to justify a long position. I usually do not include technicals in my articles, but I do think it is interesting to note that ETH is trading below its 200 EMA (exponential moving average) or 50-day EMA. Simple moving averages paint a similar picture. Data by YCharts While if you use the Ethereum price chart, the cryptocurrency is trading above 200 day moving average. In addition, the 50-day has crossed the 200-day. A very traditional bullish technical signal: Ethereum moving averages (Tradingview) I think it is interesting because I think the ETHE price action likely lags the price action of Ethereum itself a little bit. Obviously, it has its own idiosyncratic influences but ultimately it has to follow Ethereum to a degree. Taking everything together I believe this is a very interesting moment to buy or add a little bit of ETH.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4579655-grayscale-ethereum-trust-55-percent-discount-to-nav-looks-like-bargain?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/9566883.jpeg
