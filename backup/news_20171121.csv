42400660,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKNYa,1511303417,BitLicense Architect Ben Lawsky Joins Ripple Board,"Ben Lawsky, the former New York Superintendent of Financial Services who spearheaded the BitLicense regulatory framework while in office, has joined startup Ripple's board of directors.  According to a press release from Tuesday, Lawsky will help Ripple advance its payment platform as well as its in-house digital asset, XRP.  ""The company and its leadership are passionate about making our global financial system more efficient, more secure and more fair,"" he said in a statement.  Lawsky is perhaps best known for establishing the BitLicense framework, the notable and at-times controversial regulatory scheme that took shape in 2013 and 2014 and came into effect the following year. Since then, only a few licenses have actually been awarded, and a still-active legal effort aiming to undo the BitLicense remains ongoing.  And though a new consulting firm created in 2015 raised the prospects of Lawsky advising the industry he once sought to regulate, the former NYDFS chief has largely stayed on the sidelines.  In a departure, however, Lawsky last month spoke about possible regulations for initial coin offerings (ICOs) at the Money2020 conference in Las Vegas, saying the potential for fraud could cause ""a backlash against the entire bitcoin and crypto ecosystem.""

42400674,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKNnL,1511299800,New Code Released for Vlad Zamfir's Ethereum 'Casper' Upgrade,"The initial version of the Casper proof-of-stake protocol upgrade from Ethereum developer Vlad Zamfir has been released.  Published on Tuesday  , the code – following its presentation at the Devcon3 event in Cancun earlier this month – aims to fundamentally rework how blocks are created and propagated on the ethereum network. It's actually one of two simultaneous bids to develop code for Casper, with the other arm being spearheaded by network creator Vitalik Buterin.  Zamfir's take on Casper comes several days after the publication of a white paper, titled ""Casper the Friendly Ghost.""  The paper focuses on ""correct-by-construction consensus protocols,"" seeking to simplify how blockchains achieve consensus in a ""partially synchronous network."" In other words, it's trying to reduce the overall complexity of the blockchain.  This approach differs from Buterin’s own white papers on the upgrade. Buterin had previously released a three-part explanation of how his vision of Casper would operate.  While Zamfir's code release may represent on a small part of a bigger effort, its publication signals a new phase of development that will bring ethereum a step closer to overhauling the infrastructure that underlies the network.  As explained by CoinDesk, miners today discover and add new blocks through the proof-of-work process, in a way similar to how bitcoin functions (with some differences that are unique to ethereum, like the discovery of ""uncle"" blocks.)  This energy-intensive process is a competitive one, driving miners to purchase power-hungry graphics cards – a cycle that has led firms like AMD and Nivida to report significant revenues thanks to the renewed interest in cryptocurrency mining.  Yet Casper would, if and when fully realized, aim to shift away from this model entirely. Nodes could mine by essentially having funds deposited– the ""stake"" in proof-of-stake – and held over time, generating rewards as the node discovers each new block.

42400665,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKNcW,1511294439,Blockchain Data Links Tether 'Attack' to 2015 Exchange Hack,"Those behind the alleged theft of $31 million worth of Tether's US dollar-backed tokens were also involved in a high-profile hack two years ago, a cybersleuth has concluded from available blockchain data.  The company behind the dollar-backed cryptocurrency tether claimed Monday night that it had been robbed, sparking a new wave of speculation around the token, its backers and its alleged role in recent bitcoin market movements.  And, as might be expected, the availability of public blockchain data for the transactions involved led a number of observers online to trace them back in an attempt to find answers.  In posts on the r/bitcoin and r/cryptocurrency subreddits, a user going by the handle SpeedflyChris has linked the alleged Tether attack to the $5 million hack of Bitstamp in 2015. As reported at the time, employees at that Luxembourg-based bitcoin exchange fell victim to a weeks-long phishing attempt, ultimately leading to the loss of some 18,000 bitcoins.  At the heart of SpeedflyChris' analysis is this wallet, for which transactions from Bitstamp can be seen dating back to January 2015.  As SpeedflyChris notes, the address in question was used to send bitcoins to another address that later received tokens from Tether's ""treasury"" wallet, in a series of 21 transactions over the course of Nov. 19. Included in the alleged theft of the roughly $31 million in tethers was 5 BTC, which ended up in three separate wallets as Tether uses Omni, a bitcoin-based software protocol to effectively ""tag"" coins to serve different purposes.  Separately, SpeedlyChris' analysis indicates that the primary address in question is also connected to thefts that occurred at the China-based bitcoin exchange Huobi in 2015, as well as a number of transactions to peer-to-peer bitcoin exchange LocalBitcoins.  What now?  Despite the pseudonymous nature of public blockchains like bitcoin, the data offers a level of transparency into the movements of the funds involved.  Yet the absence of identifying information beyond wallet addresses means that online sleuthing has its limitations.  On the other hand, in the event of a law enforcement investigation, such data could ultimately come into play.

42400676,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKNoK,1511286030,Report Warns SAFT May Increase Legal Risk of Token Sales,"Far from insulating token issuers against regulatory actions, the proposed SAFT framework may actually increase the risk certain sales run afoul of securities laws, according to a new report out today.  If put into practice, the Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT) structure could misalign incentives, encouraging sophisticated early investors to flip tokens for a profit and driving up their cost to end-users, warns the reporthttps://cardozo.yu.edu/sites/default/files/Cardozo%20Blockchain%20Project%20-%20Not%20So%20Fast%20-%20SAFT%20Response_final.pdf from the Cardozo Blockchain Project at Cardozo Law School in New York.  The 13-page report lays out a detailed, though civil, critique of the SAFT white paper issued last month by the Cooley law firm and Protocol Labs. That paper was billed from the get-go as a conversation-starter, and Marco Santori, the Cooley lawyer who spearheaded the project, invited feedback from the legal community.  But the feedback in the Cardozo paper suggests that making initial coin offerings (ICOs) compliant with securities laws, while still delivering on the technology's disruptive promise, may be a harder needle to thread than the SAFT solution anticipates.  The paper cautions:  ""[T]he SAFT approach could heighten the exuberance manifesting in markets for blockchain-based tokens and make it even more difficult to provide consumers access to potentially impactful new technology.""  SAFT refresher  Stepping back, the SAFT framework called for splitting the ICO process into two parts in order to avoid the risk certain types of blockchain tokens might be classified as securities.  First, the developers of a token-based blockchain network would raise money from accredited investors to build it. In return, the investors would get the right to tokens once the platform is completed, possibly at a discount. This agreement, known as a SAFT, would be registered as a security with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  In the second part, once the network is up and running, the tokens are sent to the investors, who can then sell them on the open market. The tokens themselves wouldn't be securities, allowing the general public to buy them for use on the platform.  In this way, only wealthy individuals and institutional buyers, not the proverbial mom-and-pop investors, would bear the risk of the project failing, while consumer protection regulations would still apply if the final product – the network – turns out to be defective. And importantly, the publicly available tokens would not meet the so-called Howey test of whether something is a security, the SAFT white paper argued, since only the early investors would be expecting a profit from ""the efforts of others.""  But according to the Cardozo paper, bifurcating the process like this may actually compound the risks to token issuers and consumers alike.  Not so simple  For starters, the paper says, there is no easy test for whether an instrument is a security.      ""[C]ourts and the SEC have repeatedly, and unambiguously, explained that the test for whether a particular instrument will be deemed a security depends not on bright-line rules but rather on the relevant facts, circumstances and economic realities,"" the Cardozo paper says.              Further, in order to attract the early investors in a SAFT security, the sellers would naturally be expected to ""emphasize the speculative, profit-making potential of the underlying utility token,"" the authors write.  Yet, marketing the agreement this way ""may well impact a federal securities law analysis of a token developed pursuant to a SAFT,"" they warn, adding:  ""Artificially dividing the overall investment scheme into multiple events does not change the fact that accredited investors purchase tokens (albeit through SAFTs) for investment purposes, and likely will not prevent a court from considering these realities when assessing whether these tokens are securities.""  Hence, ""[t]okens underlying a SAFT may be more likely to be deemed securities, thus potentially subjecting token sellers to significant legal or economic risks,"" the paper says – the opposite result of what the proposal set out to do.  Meet the new boss...  The other main danger is that the SAFT approach ""creates a class of early investors that are incentivized to flip their holdings instead of supporting enterprise growth, which could fuel speculation and hurt consumers,"" the Cardozo critique says.  The concern is that well-connected insiders ""will receive exclusive access to purchase utility tokens — a fundamentally consumptive technology — at an early stage in the platform's development and at substantial discounts, even though they have no intent to use these tokens or enjoy the underlying technology.""      Rather, these gatekeepers would drive up the price of the tokens through speculation, ""potentially making it more expensive for consumers to purchase tokens and participate on these networks,"" the report says.  It concludes ominously:    ""When stripped to its core, even though the SAFT Approach is couched in terms of consumer protection, the result very well could be the opposite.""    In other words, rather than democratizing access to technology, as blockchain networks are often purported to do, the SAFT might just create another old boys' club.  For his part, Santori said he and his SAFT white paper co-authors welcomed the Cardozo response.  ""We're over the moon to see the SAFT project work like this,"" he said by email today, adding: ""Generating this kind of commentary and discourse is precisely the aim of the Project and precisely what the industry needs to develop a compliant token sale framework.""

The benefits are becoming better understand and therefore it is growing in popularity. Not least as the early adopters - who seized early manifestations of Bitcoin - are now beginning to report fortunes made. However, Bitcoin is rising in usage not just due to potential investment opportunities. It is also an increasingly favoured method for buying and selling goods and services online. Impossible to counterfeit, it is also a universal currency system throughout the world. Transactions can be completed in real time, without fees or delays. Perhaps the biggest advantage is that it is a currency that needs no “middle man” or physical process. Bitcoin is impossible to lose or steal. All of this is going to ensure that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies gain even more ground. Other blogs in this series provide easy to follow summaries and more information about what Bitcoin actually is, and how to acquire it. This overview is designed to answer questions you may have about how to use Bitcoin, for a growing range of financial transactions. Setting up to use Bitcoin The other two things you need in order to use Bitcoin are an internet connection and the initial capital to start to use this decentralised and worldwide payment and sales method. As covered in more detail in a previous blog, you first need to buy Bitcoin by any one of a number of means. This includes purchasing them from a trusted Bitcoin Cash exchange. Sometimes, this involves paying a trader a small service charge to provide you with an initial start-up amount. They will also ensure it is stored digitally for you. Larger amounts can be purchased through a trading exchange. It is straightforward to open an account with a chosen Bitcoin trading exchange, just as you would with a bank. There are also Bitcoin ATMS – places you can convert cash into Bitcoins. These are increasingly available in city locations throughout the world. You could buy Bitcoin for someone else via the internet or offline, though it is imperative to check the credentials of anyone you deal with, just as you would with any other financial service provider. It is becoming increasingly possible to earn Bitcoin as part of an employment contract too. And of course, you could offer products or services in exchange for payment in Bitcoin. Incidentally, you may come across the term “mining Bitcoin” and hear of people converting complex computer programmes and mathematical equations to create new Bitcoins. In the early days, this was more common. It is now something only highly specialist companies with complex mining hardware tend to do, not least as there are considerable risks involved. Mining is also sometimes used to refer to the processing of Bitcoin transactions. How to use a Bitcoin wallet However you choose to acquire your Bitcoin, you are going to need somewhere to keep it. Some people simply keep Bitcoin in the account where it was created. However, for security and ease of use, many more prefer to transfer it to their own personal control and storage system. This involves having a Bitcoin ""virtual"" wallet. The form this wallet takes depends on your own preferences and likely usage. There are various options and it all comes down to what you think would work best for you. A wallet is a personalised storage system for Bitcoin that can sit on your mobile or computer. It is therefore based on a mobile app or web software. These options are usually free to download. What is a Bitcoin public address? From your chosen software, you will generate an individual security code for your wallet - a public Bitcoin address. This is a string of characters that are unique to you and that provide you with a colossal amount of security. It is similar to the concept of an email address but far longer and more random-looking, with around 30 distinct symbols. You may also hear this referred to as your Bitcoin “signature”, or even as a “key”. It provides you with a digital identity, but not one that carries with it any method to trace your actual contact details. In other words, with a Bitcoin address, you are contactable but also totally anonymous. This address is also your mechanism to spend Bitcoin and a place other people can send cryptocurrency to you. You could send an amount of Bitcoin to your public address, from your wallet. Once there, you have the option to “send” or “withdraw” your Bitcoin. One of the reasons you have this public address is that one of the pivotal features of Bitcoin is that all transactions are stored transparently and permanently on the internet. Anyone who wants to check the validity and movement of Bitcoin can access digital records of its history and movement. Ready to use Bitcoin? Having got to this stage, you are now in a position to spend, donate or invest your cryptocurrency. Remember, this is an instant and global transaction system. No matter where you are in the world, you can use Bitcoin wherever they are accepted. There are numerous exciting developments in the acquisition and use of cryptocurrency. This includes the fact that the methodology for spending it is embracing an increasing number of innovations. One option is to purchase a Bitcoin debit card (third parties charge a fee for this method of spending your cryptocurrency). This could be loaded with Bitcoin funds for you to use as you would any other debit card. Which means that in this context, you can use Bitcoin to buy almost anything you can afford. Otherwise, much of your use of Bitcoin will be for online transactions. When you make a Bitcoin transaction, including purchasing goods or services, this will appear on the peer-to-peer computer network. This is where it will be confirmed before it is finalised. In this way, measures are in place to ensure that the cryptocurrency you use is unique and that it is a bona fide sale. Within a few minutes, you will receive confirmation that the transaction can proceed. Each software uses a different system for your Bitcoin wallet, but each will give you a confirmation score for the transaction. This will rank reliability. It provides you with a valuable added security feature. You should only finalise the transaction when the score indicates that this is a reliable exchange or sale - unless you know the person well and can ignore a low-reliability count. How to spend Bitcoin You will find that, in the coming months, increasing numbers of merchants will accept cryptocurrency as a payment for goods and services. There are already many online stores that are early adopters of bitcoin transactions. This includes some major e-commerce and technology companies, such as Expedia. PayPal, Microsoft and Dell. However, it is apparent that physical retail outlets are also beginning to jump on board, in order to fight for market share. This includes, for example, Subway. So you will find increasing numbers of stores in your locality who will accept Bitcoin payments. There have been sizeable purchases made using Bitcoin in recent times, such as high-end property. There are even basic health service providers, such as dentists, willing and able to receive Bitcoin payments. International health service providers such as specialist private hospitals also offer the option of paying in Bitcoin. You can use your Bitcoin to purchase gift cards. Among the companies offering this service are Amazon and US firm Sears. Or, you could use the Bitcoin as a gift in itself. Giving a quantity of cryptocurrency to someone for a birthday or wedding gift, for example, still carries a novelty value and provides the recipient with an instant investment opportunity. To give someone Bitcoin as a gift you would need their public address, and then you could transfer the required amount online. How can you make money from Bitcoin? Largely the answer to that lies in patience. As there are only a limited amount of Bitcoins created, they will rise in value as more people use and exchange them. Hold on to your bitcoin, and it should become a good investment. Once familiar with the world of cryptocurrency, it is also possible to trade Bitcoin in order to make money. There are also opportunities to invest in Bitcoin mining initiatives. It is important to emphasise that using Bitcoin as an investment is not easy or without its perils. You need to do research and understanding its risks, choosing any partners with the greatest of care. Using bitcoin for your business Another important way to use Bitcoin is to add it to the ways in which customers can pay for your products and services if you are in business. Providing this alternative payment method gives your customers another option, and looks set to be an increasingly important way to keep a competitive edge. You would set up Bitcoin reserves, a wallet and a public address as outlined above. Then, anyone wishing to pay in cryptocurrency would be provided with your public Bitcoin address. They transfer the required amount into your wallet from their own Bitcoin wallet. Converting bitcoin back to currency If required, you can use Bitcoin as a way to store some of your savings, drawing on it for purchases as and when needed. You could also convert it back to cash at a later date. This could include taking physical currency out of Bitcoin ATMs. (This may involve a fee, so check the terms of the ATM carefully) You can also convert cryptocurrency back to cash by selling it. The science and other notes on using Bitcoin You may be wondering how Bitcoin works in terms of the actual mathematics and computer science. If that was easy to understand, we could all create our own version! In a nutshell, it is like a huge digital public ledger. This is called a blockchain. All confirmed transactions are included as ‘blocks’ of data. As each block is created, it becomes transparent on a peer-to-peer computer network of users. They validate it. The fact that the network can see it is one of the ways it has inherent security and 100% reliability. Bitcoin transactions are public, and therefore it is impossible to sell Bitcoin twice, or steal it. When you carry out a transaction using Bitcoins, the fail-safe systems used will ask for confirmation at least once (see above for scoring reliability). You could be asked to confirm the transaction up to six times. This is to avoid transfer of cryptocurrency involuntarily or without clear agreement. Just one other important note on the topic of how to use Bitcoins. You need to keep in mind that cryptocurrency transactions are binding. They are impossible to undo or reverse. This means it is imperative that you only use Bitcoins to invest, spend or sell, when you are dealing with a trustworthy business or individual. If you do use your Bitcoin and find you have been scammed or made a mistake, there is no form of help available. It is irreversible and you are “on your own”. Remember also to back up your wallet on a regular basis. Just as with any other digital information, you need to be sure you are not leaving yourself vulnerable to its loss if you have your laptop or smartphone stolen or broken beyond repair. It is possible to store some of your Bitcoin in an offline wallet too, so you can still access it without Wi-Fi, or if you lose your ability to connect to your online wallet for any other reason. Another thing to keep in mind is that Bitcoin is a fast evolving entity. Though the core premise and benefits stay the same, its application and usage change rapidly, which means you need to keep checking back on this website for new tips on how to acquire and use Bitcoin and of course, for insights on how to make money from cryptocurrency investment.",POSITIVE,없음,BCH | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,Crypto Daily,http://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/how-to-use-bitcoin,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/15989441.jpeg

This means it is imperative that you only use Bitcoins to invest, spend or sell, when you are dealing with a trustworthy business or individual. If you do use your Bitcoin and find you have been scammed or made a mistake, there is no form of help available. It is irreversible and you are “on your own”. Remember also to back up your wallet on a regular basis. Just as with any other digital information, you need to be sure you are not leaving yourself vulnerable to its loss if you have your laptop or smartphone stolen or broken beyond repair. It is possible to store some of your Bitcoin in an offline wallet too, so you can still access it without Wi-Fi, or if you lose your ability to connect to your online wallet for any other reason. Another thing to keep in mind is that Bitcoin is a fast evolving entity. Though the core premise and benefits stay the same, its application and usage change rapidly, which means you need to keep checking back on this website for new tips on how to acquire and use Bitcoin and of course, for insights on how to make money from cryptocurrency investment.",POSITIVE,없음,BCH | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,Crypto Daily,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/how-to-use-bitcoin,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/15990405.jpeg

42400670,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKNiQ,1511283015,ECB President Draghi: Cryptocurrency Impact Still 'Limited',"The head of Europe's central bank thinks cryptocurrencies are too low-impact to regulate.  Speaking to the European Parliament on Monday, Mario Draghi said digital currencies are not a threat to the ECB’s control over the euro due to a lack of adoption within the 27-member economic bloc. As a result, cryptocurrencies’ impact on the economy would be limited, according to Reuters.  He was quoted as telling lawmakers:  “We think that all this is pretty limited. So it’s not yet something that could constitute a risk for central banks.”  Draghi's remarks come just days after an ECB governing council member said central banks are trying to decide whether to regulate digital currencies. National Bank of Austria president Ewald Nowotny said lawmakers are asking themselves whether they should get involved in regulating cryptocurrencies, citing China’s recent shutdown of bitcoin exchanges.  Indeed, this week's statements are the latest in which Draghi, who previously serves as head of Italy's central bank, has opined on the subject of cryptocurrencies – while also demurring on the question of whether the institution will ultimately pursue some form of regulation.  Draghi said the ECB would not regulate the space last month, telling the press that he saw bitcoin as being too immature to regulate.  He followed up by noting that people should ""cherish"" innovations in the financial sector, including cryptocurrencies, while still being wary of any potential risks.  Draghi also does not think the ECB can regulate bitcoin, telling the parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in September that regulating cryptocurrencies falls outside the scope of the bank’s powers.

As per CoinMarketCap, the bitcoin-U.S. dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate slumped to a low of $7,762 at 04:59 UTC, before quickly recovering to $8,100. At press time, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at $8,090 levels. Despite the massive gyrations, BTC is still up 0.66 percent on the day.  The sell-off occurred after cryptocurrency firm Tether reported a $31 million theft of its dollar-pegged token, USDT. As detailed in our update, Tether blamed a ""malicious action by an external attacker"" for the theft of $30,950,010-worth of USDT on Nov. 19.  Tether was set up as a proxy for US dollars that can be sent between exchanges, including Bitfinex, Poloniex and others. Thus, the initial response from the market was cautious, as traders weighed the possible market ramifications.  However, bitcoin soon recovered to $8,100 levels, possibly as traders absorbed the news of Tether's plan to lock up the stolen tokens by updating its Omni Core software client.  Either way, BTC could remain well bid as investors may price-in the potential surge of institutional interest in the cryptocurrency following the listing of BTC futures on the CME exchange – anticipated for a Q4 launch.  Further, the price action analysis shows no major signs of stress in the market.  4-hour chart  The above chart shows:  The sharp recovery from below $7,800 has defended the bullish flag breakout.  The relative strength index (RSI) is bullish (above 50.00) and well short of the overbought territory.

The report, issued by the Directorate General for Internal Policies, investigates the possible role of blockchain technology in the use case, concluding that it might ""present interesting potentials"" for effective prevention of fraud through increased transparency and data privacy.  The report explains:  ""The blockchain technology currently proposed by the car engineering and electronics industry would allow downloading mileage and GPS data from vehicles, and securing it on a 'digital logbook'.""  The study further suggests that blockchain can be supported by a ""connected cars"" concept that allows cloud access to all relevant vehicle data in a future scenario involving autonomous vehicles.  Blockchain technology is one among the three approaches identified to address odometer fraud in the paper, including a standardized framework based on international standards (ISO) and equipping a vehicle with hardware security modules (HSMs) to protect data.  The issue of odometer fraud, or ""clocking,"" is one being investigated by other startups in the blockchain space, as well as major enterprises.  In June, CoinDesk reported on a project by startup BigchainDB and German energy company Innogy that aims to create digital identities for vehicles on a blockchain.  To tackle clocking, the CarPass project creates a record of the odometer and vehicle activity with the data visible and verifiable on a digital platform.

42400662,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKNaY,1511254822,"Lightning Can Scale Bitcoin, But Are Costs a Barrier?","It's possible bitcoin's Lightning Network will fall short of its lofty ambition – at least, that's what a group of researchers are arguing.  Often trumpeted as the future of bitcoin, Lightning's particular twist on payments channels has served as one of the foundational ideas for scaling all public blockchains. By proposing to push transactions off of the bitcoin blockchain, but keeping strong cryptographic guarantees intact, it's believed by many developers to be the best way to increase the number of transactions the network can handle.  But the pressure for Lightning may be on. With bitcoin's debate over its own scaling roadmap now paused, some businesses, upset by the decision, are watching and waiting to see how Lightning develops. Others are packing bags – threatening to migrate to alternative blockchains with fewer users (and thus less expensive transactions).  But, if new research is any indication, there could be some bumps in the road ahead.  Specifically, computer science researchers Simina Brânzei and Eral Segal-Halevi and assistant professor Aviv Zohar have been exploring what a Lightning Network economy might look like. At issue is whether people will actually use it, or if they will simply send normal bitcoin transactions.  In this way, Zohar argues enthusiastically that, although much of bitcoin's scaling debate has centered on technological theory (whether Lightning transactions could be achieved), not much has been done in the way of determining how consumers and businesses will actually react to it.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Sometimes people talk about Lightning as if it's a done deal. They point out there are early implementations and all the work that's been done so far. But I think the fate of it will be determined partly by economic forces.""  Transaction competition  But Zohar and his colleagues are also making assumptions. As part of their research, yet to be formalized in a white paper, they are building off of a generalization that there are two main types of transactions.  The first are small transactions, which most people make on a frequent basis, say, to buy a cup of coffee en route to work. The second group consists of larger transactions, say investing in a laptop or a hot-air balloon. These purchases are made less often, but are still important.  With this in mind, the researchers guess Lightning will be used for the smaller transactions, while on-chain transactions, which come with the security of having been finalized and recorded on bitcoin's global ledger, will be used for the larger ones.  In other words, users will probably pick the cheapest option. And the cheapest option varies.  As such, Zohar believes there could be some competition between Lightning transactions and on-chain transactions. Notably, that's directly related to bitcoin's limited block size.  Only those that pay enough in fees will be able to get their transaction in the blockchain, and that's significant, since users (and businesses) are already complaining about fees today.  Varied outcomes  So, will one transaction type be cheaper overall and thus crowd out the other? Or will the two types coexist? Put another way, how well does Lightning fare against on-chain transactions?  That's the question the group is attempting to answer with economic experiments.  The researchers used the above assumptions to build two simple bitcoin economy models. The first ""toy model"" is biased toward Lightning, Zohar said. The economy has a Lightning Network, where users are inclined to make smaller transactions.  ""What we want to see is how many Lightning transactions would happen and how many big transactions. What's the fraction of each?"" he asked.  What they found, in this case, is that most transactions are conducted using the Lightning Network. An overwhelming percentage, in fact. Yet, as far as the transaction volume goes, roughly two-thirds still occurs on the blockchain.  These volume results might seem ""disappointing"" in that some bitcoin developers envision Lightning Network replacing most, if not all, bitcoin transactions, Zohar remarked.  The second simple model – another ""extreme"" case that Zohar said doesn't model what people really do – sees if this changes at all when every transaction in the economy is the same size: Users just pay 1 BTC for everything.  The takeaway, said Zohar, is that the results look different in each model. Lightning thrives in the first model, while it's ""destroyed"" in the second because users would rather pay the on-chain fees.  Educated guess  But models aren't reality – they're simply the best available guess at the outcome.  ""I do have to say, this is not the world of Lightning Network in 10 years,"" Zohar said, adding that there are many variables the researchers couldn't capture in their model, such as spending habits among different groups of people.  Plus, better wallet user experiences might one day hide these sorts of questions. Just like most internet users don't think twice about their tweets are sent across the web, users won't think about how exactly their payments are routed over the bitcoin network, whether it be on a top or bottom part of the stack.  In other words, it's impossible to predict the future. ""Our model is very naive,"" he said. ""Don't take these numbers too seriously.""  Other Lightning Network developers argued similarly.  Fabrice Drouin, the CTO of Paris-based Lightning startup ACINQ, thinks the research could be ""very important,"" even while he doubts that these models will be very accurate at such an early stage.  ""Lightning is not live yet and it is impossible to predict how it will be used and what the network will look like,"" Drouin said. ""[Because] there is no real money involved, [the models'] behavior cannot really help when it comes to predicting what will happen on [the bitcoin blockchain].""  But even if the research can't capture everything, Zohar is asking questions to set more appropriate expectations for the technology.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Our main message is not whether Lightning succeeds or fails. But that there are economic effects based on who wants to pay who and how.""  Now, Zohar and other researchers are working on yet another model that falls in between the two ""extremes"" described above, with plans to release their full findings in a paper soon.

The firm's new ""European Hub"" will be based in the U.K. capital, the startup announced earlier this week. It's the latest office launch for the company, which is headquartered in Brooklyn, New York.  That ConsenSys would look to acquire new office space is perhaps unsurprising, given a recent hiring spree that saw it tap figures who hailed from companies like IBM and Oracle, among others. ConsenSys says that it has 450 employees working worldwide, representing a quadrupling of numbers in the past year.  ""The European Hub signifies not only our commitment to servicing and investing in key European enterprises, governments, and partners, but also a recognition of the depth of blockchain talent and entrepreneurship in London and across Europe,"" Joseph Lubin, ConsenSys founder and co-founder of the ethereum project, said in a statement.  The firm is also reportedly tapping a financial services veteran to help it set up the new office in London. Deutsche Bank's former chief digital officer of global transaction banking, Ed Budd, will join ConsenSys's U.K. operation as it gets off the ground, according to EFinancialCareers.com. Budd's LinkedIn profile lists him as having begun working for ConsenSys this month.  Budd was one of Deutsche Bank's point people on blockchain, and during his time there the bank pursued applications in areas like the digitization of corporate bonds.

42428113,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL60zh,1511237759,Tether Claims $30 Million in US Dollar Token Stolen,"Tether, the company behind a dollar-pegged cryptocurrency widely used in the market's exchange trade, is claiming that its systems have been hacked and that $30 million worth of its tokens have been stolen.  In a post on the project's website (which has since been removed), Tether blamed a ""malicious action by an external attacker"" for the theft of $30,950,010 USDT yesterday. Originally launched as Realcoin and later rebranded, Tether aims to serve as a proxy for the US dollar that can be sent between exchanges, notably including Bitfinex, Poloniex and other markets without fiat trading.  In response, Tether said it would move swiftly to ensure these exchanges do not trade or otherwise introduce the stolen funds back into the cryptocurrency economy.  The company wrote:  ""$30,950,010 USDT was removed from the Tether Treasury wallet on Nov. 19, 2017 and sent to an unauthorized bitcoin address. As Tether is the issuer of the USDT managed asset, we will not redeem any of the stolen tokens, and we are in the process of attempting token recovery to prevent them from entering the broader ecosystem.""  Notably, the company said that it is releasing a new version of the Omni Core software client (which Tether runs on top of) in a bid to effectively lock up the tokens it alleges were stolen. Should nodes in the network adopt the software, it would effectively blacklist the stolen address, enacting an emergency fork to contain the funds.    Representatives from the Omni Core software project said they would seek to release new software in the coming days that will allow Tether to retrieve the stolen tokens.    Observers online spotted the move earlier today, stoking speculation about the nature of the freeze.  ""The tether.to back-end wallet service has been temporarily suspended. A thorough investigation on the cause of the attack is being undertaken to prevent similar actions in the future,"" Tether wrote.  The announcement comes amid a period of growing discussion – and controversy – around Tether.  Under scrutiny has been the unclear relationship between Tether and the troubled British Virgin Islands-based bitcoin exchange Bitfinex – and long-standing allegations the exchange has been using the asset to engage in fraud and market manipulation. Complicating matters is that the two companies are said to share a common ownership, though details remain murky as to the exact nature of the connection.  As such, today’s hack claims are likely to further drive the controversy, which began following Bifinex's hack last August, in which it lost more than $70 million in customer funds.  Following the news, other exchanges that offer order-book trading on Tether have taken steps to freeze trading, with China-based Huobi and OKCoin announcing the move shortly after the post.  CoinDesk will continue to monitor this developing story.
