42376611,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bP9d,1380905611,"Sex, drugs and racks of beef","Welcome to the CoinDesk Weekly Review 4th October 2013 – a regular look at the hottest, most controversial and thought-provoking events in the world of digital currency through the eyes of skepticism and wonder. Your host … John Law.  Silk Road in a fix  About six months ago, John Law went exploring on the Silk Road.  It was an interesting exercise, not least for the experience of loading and running the hyper-anonymous Tor network. It's an odd feeling, knowing you're completely untraceable and probably attracting the attention of the spooks.  But the Silk Road itself was exactly as advertised: a combined online forum and shop for a wide variety of things that the law does not want you to have.  Moreover, it was clearly working: a large community of users expressed satisfaction with the service provided – and the authorities, who were clearly taking a close interest, reporting that the goods were of high quality.  Law got the same feeling, as he checked the price of LSD, heroin and mescaline, as he'd had when walking into his office more than a decade ago to see every computer in ops showing the same text-based screen.  “What's that?” he asked, expecting the new Quake. “Napster...” said a glazed-eyed code monkey before crawling back between his headphones. “Can't last...” mused Law.  Of course, he was right – and wrong. Two years after it started, Napster was shut down in a hail of legal bullets, to be reborn in a lawful, neutered form of no interest to anyone.  But – whisper it – it's no harder to share files now than it was then: there are plenty of alternatives, and the world is gradually shifting to the realisation that you can't have the Internet without file sharing. And it's not worth closing the Internet down over that.  While it's not impossible to run an online drugs supermarket without cryptocurrency, it's certainly the preferred method.  But is it worth shutting down bitcoin over that? Even assuming that it's possible, a very difficult point in its own right, you know the answer to that.  Assuming Dread Pirate Roberts really did see $1.2bn worth of transactions go through the Silk Road during its lifetime - curiously, also around two years - that's a tiny fraction of the existing retail trade in illicit drugs (and a good thing too: if he had managed to make any sort of dent in the cartels' markets, he'd be five fathoms down by now. Better Fed than dead).  In the grand scheme of things, outfits like the Silk Road make good copy and are mildly embarrassing for the drug warriors, but don't change the big picture. They even have their benefits; consumer feedback improves quality and thus the health of customers, and they provide tons of useful data to officialdom, who probably made up a decent percentage of the user-base.  Like bitcoin itself, Silk Road's place in history will probably go down as not the final word but as a fascinating proof of concept.  As far as is currently known, the basic security, payment and anonymity mechanisms weren't broken. Dread Pirate Roberts – or Ross, as his mother calls him – seems to have made a few serious slip-ups in who he talked to and how, through which the FBI tracked him down (although expect a very great deal of analysis over whether the NSA and others were working, stealthily, behind the scenes). The tools used proved workable, and others will follow.  The court case will be fascinating, as there are plenty of unanswered questions. The FBI says it got an image of a Silk Road server in the summer, but seems to have had its information in spring. There is a very peculiar hitman-hiring and the commissioning – perhaps – of a murder.  The media coverage will be considerable. But regardless of what happens to the hapless Pirate, you can confidently expect two things to be true in a year's time: you will still have bitcoin, and you will still be able to buy illegal drugs just as you can now. That hasn't changed since King Charles II tried to outlaw the trifecta of killers tea, coffee and sherbet.  And, most likely, you'll be able to buy the one with the other. World not ending, no pictures at 11.  Do have a cow, man  Silk Road may only have taken payment in bitcoin – and one good question is, what will the FBI do with the 26,000 they seized during the arrest? – but most retailers who take the cryptocurrency do so in addition to other, more established payment methods. As a result, the percentage of turnover in BTC is usually down below five percent, if that.  One exception is honestbeef, an Australian beef merchant who takes bitcoin and makes up to twenty percent of revenue that way (calm down, FBI – it only delivers within Australia. That massive, massive BBQ at 935 Pennsylvania Avenue will have to wait).  Admittedly, it doesn't take any other form of payment except direct bank transfer. And David Maloney, who with his wife Peta runs the concern, is no normal farmer, choosing to describe the ordering system to customers through a diagram of nested loops that looks more like one describing a nuclear power station's cooling system than a way to get tasty cow to your plate.  The one aspect of the operation that stands out is its transparency, with who gets what cut of the asking price clearly described.  This sort of radical openness, John Law suspects, would do more to reform commerce and politics than any number of scandals and elections: imagine if you could see all the books in Google, HSBC, or our own dear Government.  Perhaps that attitude makes honestbeef an attractive place for the more reform-minded to buy their sausages: after all, in a capitalist society, every time you spend your pennies you're making a political statement.  Or perhaps honestbeef is doing well out of BTC because it's an early adopter and thus getting written about far more widely than most small meat-based businesses. Whatever works.  But if you get buttonholed by someone claiming that bitcoin is only good for buying grass, point out that sometimes it's the cows that get the grass and the bitcoin that gets the organic, ethically-farmed, lean and toothsome end result.  Is that your wallet in your pocket, or are you just pleased to see me?  Drugs. Gambling. Booze. Sirloin. Yes, bitcoin is there. But what about the other great vice – sex? John Law has long been convinced it was only a matter of time.  We are almost there, humankind. Almost, but not quite. For while you can't actually use the cryptocurrency to buy King of Bitcoin – an e-book, m'lud – the subject of that work is sex and bitcoin. It is, in short, a Satoshi-scented smutfest.  It is somewhat painful to relate the details: at 10,000 words, it's less a novel than what John Law would consider a short chapter.  Although, chances are, that may be a mercy. For the plot does not promise a peak literary experience: the protagonist is called Atlas Fawkes, and if you think that's a heavy-handed allusion to Atlas Shrugged, the libertarian's favourite pot-boiler, and Guy Fawkes, the anarchist's favourite fire-kindling, you'd be right.  In short: Atlas is picked on at school, becomes a bitcoin miner, survives a global economic collapse and becomes immensely wealthy, powerful and irresistible to women through his savvy pre-meltdown collection of the (never previously thought desperately erotic) non-fiat currency.  And that seems to be that. The author, Kayleen Knight, may try and pretend it's satire, but reader, it isn't.  John Law has no intention of parting with four dollars to actually read this. In fact, he barely made it four pages into the free preview. He is content to steal the details above from a chap who also hasn't bothered to shell out.  However, Patrick Howell O'Neill, you are the better man for so fearlessly reading all of the free extract of what is almost certainly grotesque, thudding, libertarian fantasy fodder throughout. Of which there is no shortage, entirely without charge, on the Internet.  Is there really a market for bitcoin, boobs and bum books? John Law has no idea. But he has been known to write 10,000 words of fiction on a good day, so if that's the barrier to entry he may well devote a couple of weekends to a quartet that may yet define this new genre: Mt. My Gox, Baby; Let's Play Miners and Servers; Public Key, Private Parts; and Fifty Shades Of Pay.  Literary agents, form an orderly queue. You can make contact through CoinDesk.

42376618,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bPDP,1380896489,Why reports of bitcoin's death are greatly exaggerated,"The atmosphere surrounding the bitcoin world has been in a whirlwind the past few days.  This has been because of general carelessness and what appears to be a comedy of errors that has landed the so-called “Dread Pirate Roberts” Ross Ulbricht in the slammer.  As the purported sole proprietor of the black market bazaar the Silk Road, Ulbricht has quite possibly stumbled upon one of the darkest uses of virtual currencies: people will use them to buy narcotics, weapons and other items of questionable merit.  The price  This has quite possibly created a black cloud over the world of BTC. Trader sentiment has been clear: the disappearance of an illicit use for bitcoin like the Silk Road did indeed create a sell-off.  This particular incident is one that has not been seen since April, when a spectacular run-up in the price of bitcoin peaked with a major disruption in service for the currency’s largest exchange, Mt. Gox.  Based on Bitcoin Price Index data, the collective drop-back in April due to Mt. Gox’s discord caused a 70% decrease in price, from an all-time high of $230 on April 9 to $68.35 on April 16.  By comparison, the Silk Road’s shutdown resulted in a 20% drop, from what was a relatively stable closing price of $125.49 on October 1 to $99.81 on October 2.  The current price has trended back up, which suggests that the Mt. Gox shutdown was perhaps more chaotic than that of these most recent events.  Transaction volumes  While transaction volumes have long been volatile, so has the price of bitcoin over time as people are moving in and out of fiat currencies.  This is for a number of reasons, which recently has included miners pulling their bitcoins out of the market to continue to build out hardware infrastructure and cover their increasing operating margin.  What’s remarkable, however, is that even though the Silk Road shut down, transaction volumes have been on an uptrend. They did in fact drop in late September, as copycat black market operator Atlantis shut down. But the volumes appear to be at a relatively normal level.  The United States Government owning bitcoin  While it’s dependent on an at-the-minute market price, the movement of 27,365 bitcoins on the block chain on October 4, likely from Ross Ulbricht's stash, nevertheless represents a substantial amount of holdings for the government.  In fact, conventional wisdom might suggest that with a governmental body owning so much of the currency it could create substantial market-maker powers within the bitcoin world.  Whether or not the feds wish to wield that power is irrelevant right now; seizure laws could restrict such immediate type of liquidation. However, the idea of a nation-state owning such a large denomination of a decentralized currency is quite possibly one of the reasons for such a huge sell-off.  What’s remarkable is that the price of bitcoin has gone back up a bit even with that market factor added in to the value of the price.  The myth of the Silk Road  Perhaps an overwhelming convention used while writing about bitcoin in the mainstream media is the idea that the Silk Road somehow wielded market power over the value of BTC.  Or that people are going to be damaged in some way by the fact that they cannot make illegal transactions on the site anymore.  These past few days have repudiated that assertion, one that those who have long been legitimately involved in bitcoin should clearly know by now.  There are businesses doing well providing bitcoin-related services not dependent on the purchase of drugs.  Payment processor Coinbase, for example, has been transacting $15 million in payments since May when bitcoin prices were for the most part over $100. And startup exchange BitBox had processed a record $145,000 in volume before suspending operations to rebuild their system.  These two companies along with many others are doing legitimate business in the bitcoin economy everyday, the compliant way.  Conclusion  While it’s hard to predict what will happen with bitcoin prices over the long term, the resulting events of the Silk Road have suggested that there is already a large enough bitcoin economy to overcome this.  With prices being so high at this point, it is likely that even the average person can see that there is value in it as a protocol and payment method. Plus, it is always getting easier to obtain from companies that are adhering to regulatory compliance policies.  And the closure of the Silk Road suggests that such blatant illegal activity clearly irritated the feds from the start.  Even though Ulbricht seemingly thought his libertarian ideals would allow him to evade the authorities, he was wrong. “But no one is beyond the reach of the FBI. We will find you.”, one of the investigators told Forbes defiantly, displaying their attitude towards this degree of brashness.  What do you think about bitcoin prices in light of the Silk Road’s closure? Does this legitimize the currency or does it hurt it over time? What do you think about a government having possession of so many bitcoins? Let us know in the comments.

42376610,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bPAt,1380880598,Pilot to display bitcoin logo on glider during world's first Mt. Everest flight,"The bitcoin logo could soon be seen soaring over the Himalayas as gliding competition pilot Sebastian Kawa has confirmed it will appear on his glider during a trip to Mt. Everest next month.  The nine times winner of the World Gliding Championships is aiming to raise €50,000 ($67,745) by 30th November to fund his attempt to be the first person to glide to the top of the world's highest mountains. The Everest Gliding Project is accepting donations in both fiat currency and bitcoins.  Kawa's Sponsume fundraising page shows €2,163 has already been donated in fiat currency, but Blockchain.info shows a further 9.611 bitcoins have been contributed to a wallet set up for the project.  The Polish national said he first heard about bitcoin about a year ago, but thought it was too complicated to get involved in. He continued to follow the progression of digital currency and decided it was worth using, but he hasn't invested large sums of money in bitcoin. He explained:  ""Usually if I buy some currency it is just enough for my travel or a particular purchase. It is the same with bitcoin for me, so if I need it in a particular shop, I'll use it.""  The 42-year-old is not yet sure where the bitcoin logo will be placed on the glider, as it depends which spaces are filled by the logos of corporate sponsors.  ""What is complicating things is that the glider cannot be plastered all over with sponsors' logos. If a significant portion of the surface is not white, the glider warms up in the sun, the structure fails and we repeat the Icarus (mis)adventure,"" Kawa said.  Sławek Piela, manager of the Everest Gliding Project, promised the logo would feature somewhere on the fuselage, if not the tail of the glider.  Kawa explained that the flight will be extremely challenging as the glider's wing will be flying in difficult and so far unexplored conditions. He added:  ""For this project the goal is to climb up to the highest peaks in the Himalayas using no engine, only the powers of nature – wind and thermal up currents.""  Tomasz Szast, chief executive officer of Bitcoin.Travel, which is based in Poland, has donated to the Everest Gliding Project and said he believes digital currency has a lot in common with this mission, as both are attempting to push boundaries.  He thinks it's fantastic that the bitcoin community can rally around projects to take them from concept to reality, such as homeless charity Sean's Outpost's Satoshi Forest.  Sean's Outpost has huge support within the bitcoin community and the charity is now using donations to pay $600 per month in bitcoins to the owner of nine acres of wooded land in Pensacola, Florida, which is used as a homeless sanctuary.  Szast believes the bitcoin community could get behind the Everest Gliding Project in the same way. He also thinks bitcoin would benefit from having its logo on the glider – it would give the currency and the whole ecosystem some good press. He explained:  ""Bitcoin has had a lot of bad press. It seems like every bitcoin article is about drugs, money laundering, hacks, extortion and anything else that seems like an enticing headline.""  Showing that bitcoin can be used to help people break records and achieve their goals could start to change public perception of digital currency, Szast suggested.
