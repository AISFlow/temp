Bakkt initially planned to open its futures exchange in 2018 but postponed its launch due to the volume of interest and the work required to prepare its services. The launch of the futures exchange was subsequently delayed several times due to regulatory issues, reportedly pertaining to asset custody. Bakkt began testing its platform in July 2019 while waiting for regulatory approval to take the platform live. Bakkt was able to release its bitcoin futures platform in September 2019, although the volume on the exchange following the release was much lower than anticipated.  Bakkt partnered with multiple organizations to build its platform, including Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Microsoft and Starbucks. Bakkt’s goal is for people to use cryptocurrencies in everyday life seamlessly over its network. Further, the company has partnered with major investment groups, including Fortress Investment Group, Eagle Seven, and Susquehanna International Group, with the aim of building a path for major money managers to offer bitcoin mutual funds, pension funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

42404548,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdis1D,1588020209,"Market Wrap: Ether Up 50% in 2020, Hits $200 on Sunday","This year has been terrible for financial markets but good for cryptocurrencies. And while much has been made about bitcoin’s (BTC) gains of 7 percent since the start of 2020, ether (ETH) has been a shining star. Year to date it’s up roughly 50 percent.       On Jan. 1, 2020, ether's price was $129.89, according to CoinDesk data. On April 27, ether was changing hands at around $192.25, not far off the $200.00 level hit on retail exchanges like Coinbase over the past weekend. “Really interesting to see ETH hitting the $200 resistance level a few times and breaking through,” said Jack Tan, founding partner at Taiwan crypto trading firm Kronos Research.      Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank, told CoinDesk the price appreciation for ether is from bullishness over finance software applications on the Ethereum network.      Read More:Ether Futures Activity Grows Ahead of July Protocol Upgrade      “They’re drivers that we all know - DeFi, Ethereum 2.0 and more decentralized apps,” Thomas said.      However, Thomas was more cautious on stablecoins, despite their recent surge on Ethereum. He pointed to long-term forecasts of near zero interest rates, especially regulated bank deposit-backed stablecoins running on the network such as USDC, PAX and BUSD.      “With very low interest rates and bid-offer spread tightening, stablecoins will move out of fashion as they'll become far less profitable,” he said.    Ether ICO treasuries almost empty    The 2017 bonanza for initial coin offerings, or ICOs, led to a flurry of projects raising capital by way of ether, which they subsequently sold off or spent otherwise. And that’s good for ether’s long-term price, says Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of cryptocurrency lending platform Nexo. “I don’t think many ICOs even have a treasury for it to get depleted now,” he told CoinDesk.      Indeed, most ICO projects no longer hold ether to sell for cash anymore, according to data on the amounts raised and remaining ether balances charted by CoinDesk Research.      Some sell pressure in ether is still possible, said Larry Sukernik, investment associate at Digital Currency Group, an institutional trading firm focused on digital currencies. CoinDesk is a subsidiary.      “Projects that still have their treasuries stocked up with crypto that’s not their native token should be converting all of it to cash, Sukernik said. “They’re not in the business of managing crypto portfolios.”      Even so, it’s clear most projects, especially the largest ones that raised ether in 2017 such as Bancor, Tezos and Filecoin, don’t have any more to sell into the market.    Crypto markets    While bitcoin was in sideways trading Monday climbing less than a percent, ether performed similarly, losing less than a percent as of 20:20 UTC (4:20 p.m. EDT).      Over the weeked, both bitcoin and ether trended upward, above their 10-day and 50-day moving average technical indicators. Although ether slipped a bit in 24-hour trading Monday, Rupert Douglas, head of institutional sales at digital asset management firm Koine remains bullish on both assets. “I think bitcoin and ether are about to rally,” he said.

The biggest winners included lisk (LSK) climbing by 5.7 percent, decred (DCR) up by 1 percent and tron (TRON) gaining 1 percent.      Losers on Monday include neo (NEO) dipping 3 percent, dash (DASH) in the red 3 percent and qtum (QTUM) losing 3 percent. All price changes are as of 20:20 UTC (4:20 p.m. EDT).     Other markets    In commodities, gold traded sideways Monday, down less than a percent, and closed the New York trading session at $1,713.

U.S. gross domestic product for the first quarter is expected to be released April 29.

42404534,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdirlT,1588015539,"CryptoWars Leaves Loom Sidechain in Pivot to 'Play-to-Earn,' Aka Betting","In another data point raising questions for blockchain-based gaming, Experimental Games' CryptoWars has pivoted away from running on the Plasma sidechain operated by Loom. Meanwhile, Loom appears to be pivoting away from gaming entirely.      ""No decent game can run nowadays fully on-chain, even though that was our gaming utopia,"" CEO Matias Nisenson told CoinDesk. Loom, he said, is discontinuing its service aimed at gamers, and Experimental doesn't trust any other provider.      There are diverging accounts about what happened here. Nisenson told CoinDesk that Loom collapsed multiple times under the activity driven by CryptoWars. Loom disputes that account.      ""CryptoWars ran fine on Loom. Platform handled it fine,"" former Loom CEO Matthew Campbell wrote in an email to CoinDesk. Loom has not yet replied to a request for additional comment.      Campbell claimed Experimental was upset Loom wouldn't provide funding for its game to continue operating. ""Games don't make any money and just continually want the platforms to fund them. That just doesn't make business sense,"" Campbell wrote.    Looming questions    Loom was very early into the scaling conundrum that has plagued Ethereum. It was a company doing a lot of things: tutorials, games and, most importantly, sidechains. Last autumn it even got into interoperability, starting with Tron and Binance Chain. In February, Loom notified users Campbell was stepping out of the CEO role. According to his LinkedIn profile, Campbell has been CEO at Remote Ventures since August.      Read more: ZombieChain Comes Alive: Can Ethereum Sidechains Save the Dapps?      CryptoWars, which previously ran on Loom's Plasma sidechain network, is a resource management game that debuted last year as a massively multiplayer online game (MMOG). At its peak, the game had 12,000 players going at once, Nisenson said, making it one of the top dapps on Loom. To win, players built mines, built vaults, built an army and then used it all to grow a treasure chest.      Early on, it would run weekend-long global tournaments with solid prize packages put up by sponsors including the MakerDAO Foundation. Members of the CoinDesk editorial team burned a considerable amount of time last summer on one of these competitions (no prizes were attained).      ""Loom basically exploded"" during the first CryptoWars tournament, Nisenson said. It improved but the game still put the network under too much stress. ""Blockchain does not scale now,"" he said.      To be competitive, players basically had to stay by their terminals at all times. People weren't sleeping, Nisenson said.      Preview(opens in a new tab)    The gaming biz    Loom had previously had a considerable focus on gaming, though its sidechains were meant to be useful for many applications. Not only did it provide services to game makers, it created its own Kickstarter-funded, zombie-themed collectible card game, Relentless. Its website touts other clients in the crypto gaming space, including Axie Infinity, Neon District and Crazy House.      However, in the blog post about its leadership transition, Loom indicates other priorities, writing, ""Recently, we've been working on a couple of new projects, one targeting the healthcare industry and one targeting the travel industry.""      Read more: 'MLB Champions' Downplays ETH, Aims for Mass Market in New Game Reboot      It is unclear how that will affect the network's existing gaming titles.      One corner of the industry has long argued gaming would be crypto's gateway drug to the mainstream but video games have never really done as well as gambling. And that's where CryptoWars is headed. The game now only uses blockchains for one thing: money.      ""We went from fully on-chain to just accepting crypto and paying crypto,"" Nisenson told CoinDesk. ""We use Coinbase Commerce and MoonPay for crypto deposits and credit card deposits, respectively.""      Money is important to the game now because its business model has shifted to players betting on who wins a 20-minute, one-on-one game. Rather than the weekend-long marathon sessions, competitors can now put up as little as $0.60 or as much as $100 on the 20-minute sprints. Whichever player wins takes the pot, after Experimental takes its 17 percent cut.      Experimental calls this ""play-to-earn,"" but to earn someone also needs to risk paying. That's why most people would call the model wagering. The new approach became necessary when the company realized there was no good alternative to playing large games on-chain.      The play-to-earn version soft-launched last week. In its first day, CryptoWars topped 600 one-on-one matches, with the most staked on a game at $100 (the max allowed).      The game is playable around the world, including most states in the U.S. Entering the game can be done in fiat. That said, winnings can only be extracted in crypto, so blockchain newbies will need to learn a wallet like MetaMask if they want to take their gains outside the game world.      If it can make the model work for CryptoWars, Experimental says it will invite outside strategy games onto the platform.      ""The idea is: Most game studios all around the world, they just make games,"" Nisenson said. ""Most of them are unsuccessful and they don't make money, but they are still good games.""    Sponsored play    Players don't have to bet money to play the new version of CryptoWars. There's also a practice space where you can build your skills.      In fact, players will accumulate play money the more games they play in free mode. The game will release more play money regularly but players will need to be in the game to collect it, rewarding attention. Further, periodically the game will run tournaments where real money from sponsors can be won, and it will only take play money to enter. The first sponsored games should go up in the next few weeks.      Sponsors will also boost the winnings on games played with real funds at stake. This echoes the approach taken on decentralized finance (DeFi) site PoolTogether, where sponsors buy tickets to grow the pot, but never actually win.      The winnings will continue as long as Experimental can make this iteration turn a profit. In crypto gaming, that's been an elusive dream.",NEGATIVE,ETH,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/04/27/cryptowars-leaves-loom-sidechain-in-pivot-to-play-to-earn-aka-betting,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/460228dd55afd14ab80875a326bedbb6dca1087d-2000x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Last week, Bittr, a Dutch crypto exchange announced it would close shop citing the burden of complying with new anti-money laundering (AMLD5) regulations in the nation. This is likely the first of many such closures of cash-strapped companies that now have to meet a new definition of compliance. Here's the story:      You're reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they're significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk's newsletters here.      Regulatory Squeeze Recent Dutch anti-money laundering (AMLD5) regulations are squeezing small crypto exchanges. Under Dutch law, businesses pay for their own regulations out of pocket, and often incentive firms to keep lawyers on retainer, pay a compliance officer or find a third party to manage costs. Announced Friday, Bittr, the first of what could be many crypto exchanges to fold under these capital constraints, announced it would shut down.      Crypto Credit LGO Markets is taking an unusual step for a cryptocurrency exchange by letting clients trade without pre-funding accounts. The exchange is now offering intraday credit lines and to send cash to its client base of hedge funds and market makers when the trading day is over.      AI Advances SenseTime, an artificial intelligence startup, has inked a deal with China’s Digital Currency Research Institute, which is building China’s Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DC/EP), “to pool their research and foster innovative new applications under a joint effort to deploy AI advances across the country’s financial sector,” the South China Morning Post reports.      Tether's Line Tether's CTO hopes a new EOS-Bitcoin interoperability bridge could make tether cheaper and faster because users will be able to make transactions on less-congested blockchains, using wrapped pTokens. Launching Friday, the company will first support a bitcoin wrapper on the EOS mainnet – pBTC.

Site Seizure The U.S. departments of Justice and Homeland Security have seized coronaprevention.org after its owner tried to sell the domain for bitcoin after posting about it in a ""hacker's forum."" The price tag was allegedly $500, payable in bitcoin. Such domains are usually closer to $20, the warrant states. The crime isn’t price gouging, but reportedly that an undercover agent said they wanted to use the site to sell fake COVID-19 testing kits, a plan the owner reportedly said was ""genius.""

Market Intel    Dash for Cash Ether's price might be getting a boost from the crypto industry's version of the dash for cash. As investors rush to US dollars, there's been a corresponding demand for tether and other dollar-linked stablecoins, many of them built atop the ethereum blockchain network. Led by tether (USDT), the total outstanding amount of stablecoins surged this month to nearly $9 billion, from less than $6 billion in early March.      Halving Bump Bitcoin's rally is gathering pace with the mining reward halving 14 days away. The cryptocurrency rose to $7,800 early on Monday to hit its highest level since ""Black Thursday"" when prices dropped to $4,700 amid a larger coronavirus-led market selloff. Much of the recent price drive is coupled to a rally in traditional markets, but some indicators show the bullish narrative surrounding the upcoming halving is also contributing to bitcoin’s rise.

On-chain games, such as Blockchain Cuties and Super Player, would be available from the store from Monday, with other dapps slated to be added in the near future, Tron added.      Tron founder Justin Sun said the collaboration with Samsung was going ""to the next level by integrating both ecosystems together.""

Dead CEO, $190 million of customer's funds missing, mismanagement, conspiracy. But where are we now in terms of making crypto clients whole? Magdalena Gronowska, who's a member of the Official Committee of Affected Users and the Bankruptcy Board of Inspectors, says as much as the nondisclosure agreements (NDA) will allow.      For more episodes and free early access, subscribe with Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pocketcasts, Google Podcasts, Castbox, Stitcher, RadioPublica, IHeartRadio or RSS.      In our CoinDesk Live: Lockdown Edition series, CoinDesk journalists and virtual audience members chat with speakers from Consensus: Distributed, our upcoming virtual conference on May 11-15.      In this episode, CoinDesk Managing Editor Zack Seward and business reporter Nikhilesh De speak with Magdalena Gronowska, who lost several thousand dollars when Canadian crypto exchange QuadrigaCX imploded. She's now a member of the Official Committee of Affected Users and the Bankruptcy Board of Inspectors.      QuadrigaCX is one of the stories in crypto that'll end up getting made into a movie. There are so many twists and turns, and mystery remains after the exchange's CEO, Gerald Cotten, unexpectedly died (although some believe he faked his death) on a trip to India in late 2018. He was supposedly the only person who held the keys to some C$250 million (US$190 million) in user funds – a pile of money that has been in dispute ever since. But once Canadian authorities started their investigation, it became clear Cotten also mismanaged client funds in many, many ways.      It's been a little over a year since Cotten's death was reported, setting off a whirlwind investigation. Gronowska gives insight into where the case stands today.      Topics include:    How much it sucks to lose bitcoin when you're trying to stack sats  How the Committee of Affected Users operates  The role of the Bankruptcy Board of Inspectors  The craziest thing QuadrigaCX's now-deceased CEO Gerald Cotten bought with his ill-gotten gains  Would you rather be a Mt.Gox creditor or QuadrigaCX creditor?  NDAs: What the committee knows and doesn't know  How the crypto community's sleuthing actually helps the case  Brass-tacks questions from creditors  Not your keys, not your coins  Everyone's favorite: regulation, and the silver lining to the QuadrigaCX disaster: Canadians, both the crypto community and the government, thinking harder about crafting appropriate regulations  Another industry where tech, maybe even blockchain tech, could be beneficial: Canada's insolvency system.  What happens next?  Some $40 million CAD has been retrieved. Where does that money go and how will the rest be recovered?    Next up: Sign up to join the next CoinDesk Live on Tuesday, April 28 with Carlos Acevedo, founder of the Crypto Community Project, which is dedicated to educating low-income communities on crypto and blockchain.Acevedo is also the director of sales and the regional lead for Latin America at Brave.

42431820,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN6fth,1587991139,Bitcoin Hits Highest Level Since Black Thursday Amid Halving Buzz,"Bitcoin's rally is gathering pace with the mining reward halving now just 14 days away.      The top cryptocurrency by market value rose to $7,800 early on Monday to hit its highest level since March 12 – dubbed ""Black Thursday"" – when prices fell from $7,950 to $4,700 as the coronavirus pandemic crashed most markets.      At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $7,700, representing a 100 percent gain on the low of $3,867 registered on March 13.      While the major part of the recovery rally could be associated with the uptick in the S&P 500 and the global stock markets, the recent move from the April 21 low of $6,800 to $7,800 looks to have been fueled by factors other than moves in equities.      That's evident from the fact that bitcoin rose 8 percent last week, while the S&P 500 suffered a 1.3 percent loss and oil markets cratered on oversupply concerns.      Bitcoin looks to have partly decoupled from the equity markets due to the bullish narrative surrounding the upcoming halving. “The rally is being sustained by the rapidly approaching halving,” Jehan Chu, co-founder and managing partner at Hong Kong-based blockchain investment and trading firm Keneti Capital, told CoinDesk.      See also: Bitcoin Halving, Explained      Bitcoin will undergo the halving process on May 12, after which the reward per block mined will drop to 6.25 BTC from the current 12.50 BTC.      A popular narrative is that halving creates a supply deficit and, thus, bodes well for bitcoin's price. Some observers are of the opinion that the bull markets seen in 2017 and 2013 were the result of the halvings in 2016 and 2012, respectively.      “Look for prices to attempt the $10,000 level on speculative buzz leading into the halving,” Chu added. Meanwhile, Marcus Swanepoel, CEO of cryptocurrency platform Luno, said, “History tells us that we should expect an uplift in bitcoin's price as we get closer to the halving in just a few weeks' time. We've seen an increase in the price of bitcoin in previous halvings.”      Past data shows the cryptocurrency tends to hit a new market cycle top (the highest point from the preceding bear market low) in the calendar year of a halving – but before the event, according to analyst Rekt Capital.      If the historical pattern repeats, we could see a rise to levels above $13,880 (2019 high) before the third halving, due in two weeks.      While that target looks far-fetched, a convincing break above $8,000 cannot be ruled out, as on-chain data shows a significant improvement in network activity.      For example, the seven-day average of the number of active bitcoin entities recently rose above 260,000 for the first time since June 2019, signaling an influx of new investors into the market, according to blockchain intelligence firm Glassnode.      The active entities metric counts clusters of bitcoin addresses controlled by the same network entity. It shows the number of individuals or businesses using the network, in effect.      Further, bitcoin balances on exchanges continue to drop ahead of reward halving – a sign users are withdrawing their assets for longer-term holding. The metric appears to reflect bullish expectations tied to the halving.      What’s more, institutions and macro traders are returning to the crypto markets after last month's crash, as suggested by the rise in open interest, or open positions, in bitcoin futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) – widely considered to be synonymous with institutional activity.      Open interest rose to 233 million last Thursday to hit the highest level since Feb. 26, according to crypto derivatives research firm Skew.      However, while on-chain activity and derivatives data suggest scope for further gains, the equity markets are calling for caution.      As of Friday, the S&P 500 was up nearly 30 percent from the low of 2,192 reached on March 24 and down 17 percent from record highs. While the recovery rally looks impressive on the surface, the breadth of the move has been quite narrow, meaning the rally has been fueled by an uptick in few heavyweight stocks.      See also: Crypto Long & Short: How Oil Going Negative Could Open the Door for Bitcoin ETFs      “The S&P 500 now trades just 17 percent below its all-time high, however, the median S&P 500 constituent trades 28 percent below its record high,"" said Goldman Sachs' chief equity strategist David Kostin.

42431823,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN6fzh,1587985981,First Mover: Ether Trounces Bitcoin as Network Sees Surge in Stablecoins,"Ether's price might be getting a boost from the crypto industry's version of the dash for cash.      The coronavirus crisis has sent investors in both digital and traditional markets scrambling for U.S. dollars, seen as one of the best assets to park money in during a deflationary recession. In traditional markets, that's meant selling risky assets like stocks, junk bonds and developing-country currencies, and parking the proceeds in cash.      You're reading First Mover, CoinDesk's daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      In digital-asset markets, there's been a flurry of demand for tether and other dollar-linked stablecoins, many of them built atop the Ethereum blockchain network. Led by tether (USDT), the total outstanding amount of stablecoins surged this month to nearly $9 billion, from less than $6 billion in early March.      Some cryptocurrency analysts are now starting to ask if the stablecoin surge will boost the price of ether (ETH), which is used to pay fees known as ""gas"" to help process transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, including for other tokens.      Prices for ether, the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market value, have jumped 53 percent so far in 2020 to about $195. That compares with an 8 percent year-to-date gain for the larger bitcoin.      Ryan Watkins, a research analyst at the cryptocurrency data firm Messari, wrote last week in a report that tether's use of the Ethereum blockchain ""should be positive for ETH.""      ""It's hard to ignore the promise of decentralized programmable money if you're spending time in the ethereum economy,"" he wrote. ""This will provide a bid for ETH.""      Ether, sometimes described as the ""digital oil "" to bitcoin's ""digital gold,"" is the native currency for the Ethereum blockchain, which is known as a platform for easy issuance of new digital tokens as well as for its ""smart contract"" programming capabilities. In recent years Ethereum has become the premier ecosystem for the white-hot arena of ""decentralized finance,"" where startup companies and developer teams are designing automated lending and trading protocols that might eventually challenge banks.      Yet, ether is notoriously difficult to value, with traders relying on everything from price-chart patterns to supply-and-demand predictions to discounted cash flow analysis. Earlier this year, one blockchain consultant estimated that the cryptocurrency's price might shoot as high as $10,000 if half of Argentina's money supply abandoned the peso for dai, a decentralized dollar-linked stablecoin that's backed by ether.      ""I don't think we're at a point where fundamentals are driving these tokens,"" says Gary Zigmond, co-founder of Digico Capital, a cryptocurrency hedge fund. ""We're still at the story stage, where everything's in the future.""      Messari's Watkins says the rise of stablecoins might actually pose a longer-term threat to ether because they might usurp its potential use case as a ""medium of exchange.""      ""In this scenario, ETH will have devolved into its native early branding of digital oil, a commodity-like lubricant for the ethereum blockchain,"" he wrote. ""ETH would still be valuable like many commodities are, but ETH would not be valued like money is.""      But with the price performance beating bitcoin's so handily this year, ether bulls probably aren't worrying too much about the valuation metrics.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    Trend: Bitcoin has nearly erased the losses seen on March 12 – ""Black Thursday"" – with a move to $7,800 early Monday, and now looks set to extend its five-week winning trend.      The top cryptocurrency by market value is trading near $7,714 at press time, representing a 0.2 percent gain on the day. Prices rose more than 8 percent in the seven days to April 26 to confirm bitcoin's sixth straight weekly rise, the longest winning streak since March 2019.      The price rise could be extended further, as bitcoin balances on exchanges continues to slide ahead of the miner reward halving – a sign investors are withdrawing their assets for long-term holding ahead of the supply-cutting event, as noted by the blockchain intelligence firm Glassnode.      Bitcoin has historically put in a positive performance in the weeks leading up to halving, Marcus Swanepoel, CEO of cryptocurrency platform Luno, told CoinDesk. The bullish narrative surrounding the halving could continue to draw bids for the cryptocurrency in the short term.      Further, speculation that savvy investors might use recently minted tether and other stablecoins to fund bitcoin purchases is likely to keep retail interest high. ""Traders will want to pay close attention to the issuing of new USDT, which has historically led to a surge in bitcoin's price. With Tether having minted $120,000,000 USDT, Bitcoin could soon see a surge,"" said Swanepoel.      Technical charts, too, are signaling scope for an extension on the price rally. The four-hour chart is reporting a symmetrical triangle breakout, a bullish continuation pattern. The breakout is backed by an above-50 reading on the 14-day relative strength index and higher bars on the MACD histogram, both bullish signals.      Next, the cryptocurrency looks set to test the 100-day moving average at $8,000. The bullish case would weaken if the prices violate the support at $7,390 (low of the symmetrical triangle).",POSITIVE,ETH | USDT,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | USDT,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/27/first-mover-ether-trounces-bitcoin-as-network-sees-surge-in-stablecoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/86439064e46f576bfe6e5a200117f906b881a4b1-1500x980.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431805,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN6fRh,1587980400,"Crypto Exchange Offers Credit Lines so Institutions Can Trade Now, Pay Later","LGO Markets is taking an unusual step for a cryptocurrency exchange by letting clients trade without pre-funding accounts.      The Hoboken, N.J.-based firm's clients, mostly crypto hedge funds and market makers, can now get an intraday credit line and send cash to the exchange when the trading day is over, CEO Hugo Renaudin told CoinDesk. For LGO, which now boasts over 50 clients (almost all of them institutions) in about 20 countries, the nominal end of the day is 10 a.m. Eastern time, Renaudin said.      After passing a risk assessment, a client can get up to “several millions” of dollars in credit to trade bitcoin and then pay what it owes at the settlement time, he said. “They don’t have to park funds, there is no risk of a hack, it’s a scalable and flexible way to finance. We can extend these credit lines, and it works as a clearinghouse.”      Although it's commonplace in traditional financial markets, allowing trades without pre-funding is rare in crypto. According to Matt Trudeau, chief product and strategy officer at ErisX, LGO’s competitor, pre-funding is necessary to mitigate counterparty risk.      “Because both cash and crypto are already in the clearinghouse, we eliminate settlement risk for the counterparties. This also means all participants on our exchange can confidently trade with all other participants on our exchange without needing to know who they are, and assess their credit risks,” Trudeau explained.      To finance this service, LGO is using a combination of funds it raised in its 2018 token sale (which brought in 3,600 BTC, nearly $36 million at the time) and borrowed capital, both in fiat and crypto, from traditional banks and crypto lenders, Renaudin said. He wouldn't identify the lenders.      LGO is banking at the crypto-friendly Signature Bank and recently got financing from the market maker B2C2, which bought a share in the exchange this month.    Course correction    The credit line is not the first unorthodox idea LGO has tried.      When it launched in March 2019, Renaudin told CoinDesk that LGO wouldn’t keep clients’ funds. The plan was that users would maintain their own custody and trade via multi-signature wallets that required two out of three private keys to release funds.      A year later, LGO quietly abandoned the idea. The reason? Institutional clients, who are the exchange’s target audience, don’t want to take care of their keys, Renaudin said last week.      “Most of the volume is made by crypto-native institutions, like hedge funds, and they are used to using custodial platforms,” Renaudin explained.      Having funds with a qualified custodian helps the institutional players sleep at night, he said, so LGO’s clients can hold their funds either on the exchange itself or use BitGo, which partnered with LGO in April 2019.      Another idea, making its own hardware wallet, which LGO was planning to release some time in the summer of 2019, also got scrapped, Renaudin said. For the same reason: no client demand.      “All the bells and whistles we talked about last year, they were good, but when confronted with the market, we saw the demand was not there,” Renaudin said.      LGO has also decided not to pursue a number of licenses as originally intended. These include a New York BitLicense, a FINRA broker-dealer license and a National Futures Association broker license. All this is on hold now, Renaudin said.      LGO decided to focus on the more familiar jurisdiction of France, where Renaudin and other members of the team hail from. The exchange has applied for a digital custodial license there, Renaudin said. LGO is registered as a money services business (MSB) in the U.S. with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the Treasury Department.      However, one idea from the early days survived: broadcasting LGO's trades (both the fiat and crypto sides) to the Bitcoin blockchain. A list of these trades can be seen on the LGO website.      According to this page, LGO has processed some $33 million worth of trades so far in April, $138 million in March and $96 million in February.

42431812,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN6fdh,1587974400,The Netherlands’ AMLD5 Interpretation Appears to Be Killing Crypto Firms,"The Dutch crypto market is seeing the first of most likely many small crypto exchanges get squeezed out following the passage of heavily criticized anti-money laundering (AMLD5) regulations.    Announced Friday in a company bloghttps://www.getbittr.com/press-releases/things-have-turned-bitter-for-bittr, Bittr founder Ruben Waterman said his bitcoin exchange, launched in 2018, will shut down by April 28 as the one-man operation does not have the capital to meet the new regulations. The Dutch National Bank (DNB) estimates that registration alone costs $36,500, in addition to rolling compliance needs.    The development shows what Dutch regulators expect of financial upstarts and could speak to future hurdles to cryptocurrency development in the greater European Union.      “Above all, Bittr would have to appoint a dedicated compliance officer who’s responsible for compliance with the new regulations,” Ruben wrote Friday. “Who can I appoint? Myself? That probably doesn’t work also being the sole shareholder and director.”      Read more: Dutch Crypto Startups Brawl With Regulators Over Scope of EU Money Laundering Rule      Under Dutch law, businesses pay for their own regulations out of pocket. Ruben said the options for his bitcoin savings platform included keeping a lawyer on retainer, paying a compliance officer or finding a third party to manage compliance costs in addition to the government registration fee – impossible, he said, given the firm’s small size.      Making sense of it all    As CoinDesk reported in December, Dutch cryptocurrency firms were entangled in a protracted battle of semantics with the DNB and Ministry of Finance (FIN) over the implementation of the European Union’s 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5), which went into effect in January 2020.      Bitcoin firms CoinDesk spoke with said the DNB and FIN were strengthening the EU directive needlessly while using doublespeak with the Dutch Parliament. The firms alleged the financial regulators had created a de facto licensing regime whereas AMLD5 calls for mere registration of cryptocurrency firms. These allegations were further supported by the Dutch Council of State, a governmental advisory board widely respected in the country, which asked the finance agencies to clarify their proposals.      Members of the Dutch Parliament held two competing priorities in mind: fighting money laundering and supporting the nation’s fintech firms.      Read more: European Crypto Firms Brace for Higher Costs as AMLD5 Takes Effect      In a Parliamentary report from April 21, Dutch Senator Bastiaan van Apeldoorn said it's unlikely cryptocurrencies are being used on the same scale as cash for money laundering, but they still require supervision.      Finding a soft regulatory touch that wouldn’t displace small players in the market remained the goal, he said.      “The cryptocurrency phenomenon does exist and is likely to take on even larger, if not different, forms in the future. It is therefore good that this is also adequately regulated with regard to money laundering,” van Apeldoorn said. (Editor’s note: This report was translated.)      The legislation was tied up on the point for months, even though the EU called for the directive to go into effect on Jan. 10. Legislation was finally adopted last Tuesday, although opinions on its outcome differ.      Wrote Bittr’s Ruben:    “The Minister of Finance (Wopke Hoekstra) then changed some wording so as to comply with the Council of State’s request but not actually changed any of its content. The Senate has raised questions about this practice but nevertheless approved the new regulations.”    The registration process was still a licensing regime, verbiage aside, Ruben argued. “If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck,” he wrote.    Other players    In a blog post last Wednesday, Bitonic, a Dutch exchange led by Daan Kleiman, who also heads a crypto lobbying group VBNL, said the final legislation “resolved the two main issues of concern for Bitonic.” The firm said the DNB and FIN had clarified the difference between licensing and registration plus the associated regulatory costs.      “We will closely monitor this when the law has entered into force, but it appears that for now, the threat of an excessive and costly supervisory regime is off the table,” Bitonic wrote.      Some firms haven't waited to see what the DNB and FIN would concoct, however. Industry-leading crypto derivatives exchange Deribit left the country for Panama in February, citing uncertainties around the incoming regulation.      Read more: Dutch Derivatives Exchange Deribit to Move to Crypto-Friendly Panama      “We believe that crypto markets should be freely available to most, and the new regulations would put too-high barriers for the majority of traders, both regulatory and cost-wise,” Deribit wrote in a January blog post announcing the move.      Arthur Stolk, managing director of Dutch cryptocurrency fund Icoinic, told CoinDesk in an interview that most firms had anticipated the passage and are going to wait it out until a promised evaluation by FIN takes place. His largest concern for smaller firms is with the flat regulatory fee every market participant now has to pay for oversight, as compared to a per-volume cost applied in most cases.      “The problem is that in normal traditional finance, if you are regulated and you have a license you need to pay by your volume. So, it's a fair deal. Now everyone pays the same. In one year they do the evaluation – please do it by volume because then all the small projects can stay,” Stolk said.      And, unlike other governments, the Netherlands isn’t behind the times on crypto. In fact, it’s trying to lead the charge in the EU for issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC), according to a recent DNB report.      Read more: Dutch Central Bank Wants to Be European Union’s CBDC Proving Ground      “If the decision should be taken within the euro system to experiment with a more concrete type of CBDC, we are ready to play a leading role,” the DNB wrote in its 45-page report published last week. “The Netherlands provides a suitable testing ground for such an experiment.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/04/27/the-netherlands-amld5-interpretation-appears-to-be-killing-crypto-firms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6be172e4a1e7133140d3cc61470f84f5ce9158d5-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431811,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN6fbh,1587970800,US Regulator Clears Security Token Trading System to Launch,"The Public Private Execution Network (PPEX), an alternative trading system (ATS) for exempted digital assets and other private securities, has regulatory clearance to launch in the U.S.      The trading system’s parent, broker-dealer North Capital Private Securities, completed FINRA’s continuing membership application in February and filed its Form ATS with the SEC in March, said North Capital CEO Jim Dowd.      Those green lights were all his Salt Lake City firm needed, but it sat on the news until this past Thursday. Now, the company plans to launch with digital asset trading capabilities hardwired into its ATS.      Dowd said that’s a notable difference from many other approved exempted digital asset securities-capable ATSs, which he said were retooled to handle digital securities only after they were already built.      “We basically went the other way and said, ‘OK we're going to do something de novo,’” Dowd said.      PPEX will enter the capital markets with a wide but specialized net. By Dowd’s telling, PPEX supports secondary trades for all manner of exempt securities, including digital assets native to a blockchain. These private equity products aren’t subject to the same disclosure and registration requirements as their publicly-traded products who have to register with the SEC.      Exemption appeals to issuers who “don't want to go through the brain damage and the cost of doing a registered offering,” said Dowd, but it comes with a caveat, too: Private capital markets are generally more illiquid than public ones, and their lack of transparency makes it difficult for potential investors to know what they’re getting into. PPEX will attempt to address both, Dowd said.      “We’re going to offer a solution that's kind of in between a fully private illiquid non created asset and a kind of a traditional public offering,” Dowd said. His plan will institute due diligence procedures, disclosure requirements and other processes comparable to the public listing process.      See also: Openfinance Warns It Will Delist All Security Tokens Without New Funds      Dowd said PPEX also addresses the technological deficiencies rampant in private capital markets, where the systems that securities trade on – if they trade on systems at all – are often far behind the times. That’s especially evident in the age of COVID-19, he said.      “I believe now more than ever that pushing paper and having meetings and signing things in person and doing all these things that we do with private securities could definitely be improved with blockchain,” Dowd said.      North Capital’s crypto ventures began shortly after the July 2017 DAO report release. It was still the “go-go” blockchain days, as Dowd said of the time more often referred to as the ICO boom, but in spite of what he called the “mania of the period” in a 2019 letter to the SEC, Dowd saw an opening.      “The explosive growth of the market nevertheless showed that investors want to trade private securities,” Dowd wrote to the SEC. It “offers a means by which responsible, regulated broker-dealers and ATS can develop market protocols and systems for trading private securities on secondary markets.”      North Capital previously released the precursor issuance tool in TransactAPI, which lets broker-dealers conduct online offerings of private digital assets and other exempted securities that PPEX, which is a secondary trading system, can now facilitate trades of. Dowd said TransactAPI has been involved in 1,000 deals worth a total $1.9 billion.      Though digital assets are only part of TransactAPI and PPEX’s wider private securities trading capabilities, they do represent perhaps the most transformative point, from a technological aspect at least, Dowd said.      “The digital asset technology of blockchain technology really could offer a way to automate and to make more efficient some of the inefficiencies in private markets, and that's what got us excited about technology three years ago,” he said.

Authored by CoinDesk's head of research, Noelle Acheson, it goes out every Sunday and offers a recap of the week – with insights and analysis – from a professional investor's point of view. You can subscribe here.      It turns out commodity prices don’t have a floor. Who knew. To be fair, this is not the first time a commodity has traded below zero – natural gas prices have gone negative in the past as logistical problems make it hard to get to buyers, and many refineries see it as a waste byproduct of oil production. Outside the energy sector, dairy farmers across the U.S. are currently dumping excess milk rather than pay consumers to take it away.      What does this have to do with bitcoin? It sheds light on the nature of the asset itself, and on products built on top of it.      According to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and other regulators, bitcoin is a commodity. Technically, it falls into the category of financial commodities, which include currencies and indices. These do have a floor. They can go to zero, but not below – once at the minimum, they have neither a use nor a carry cost, so investors can write off their value and, after some gnashing of teeth, forget about them.      But what if a financial commodity’s value was based on an underlying commodity that traded at negative prices? USO is the largest exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the energy sector and holds near-dated WTI futures. This week those futures were trading below zero, since they involve physical delivery of oil that no one knows where to store. But the ETF is a financial commodity, and cannot trade below zero – therefore, it cannot reflect its underlying assets.      This week, USO scrambled to save its listing. It announced a reverse share split to push its price back above the Nasdaq minimum requirement, and it changed its investment strategy to focus on slightly longer-term futures. It also applied for authorization to issue more shares, since money is pouring in, reportedly from retail investors who hope to ride the recovery all the way up.      So, here you have an ETF whose value does not necessarily reflect the underlying asset, maneuvering to be able to sell more shares to retail investors in a dislocated market that is one of the most blatantly manipulated in the world. And yet, bitcoin ETF proposals are rejected as being too risky, opaque and manipulable.      A bitcoin ETF would be based on a financial commodity that runs on a global network accessible to all. Most of the main exchanges have market surveillance, and improvements in market liquidity should enable the ETF price to closely track the market value of the underlying asset, giving investors reassuring clarity and transparency. The same cannot be said of the most liquid listed bitcoin-tracking instruments today,* which have lock-in periods during which investors cannot sell and which trade at a significant premium to bitcoin. This is largely a result of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s reluctance to approve liquid and easily redeemable investment vehicles suitable for all types of investors.      Any change in SEC policy regarding bitcoin ETFs is unlikely in the short term because there are no current proposals under consideration. But the disconnect between the reasons given for rejection and the glaringly public characteristics of many approved ETFs that also don’t meet the quoted criteria could encourage the regulator to overcome its instinctive reluctance.      (*One of these is GBTC, managed by Grayscale Investments, which is owned by CoinDesk's parent, DCG.)    Anyone know what's going on yet?    There is no such thing as a boring week in the crypto asset sector (unfortunately – a boring week would be nice every now and then), but this week was particularly intense, with the price ranging 12 percent from low to high (data from the CoinDesk BPI).      According to my colleague Zack Voell, the sharp jump upwards may have been motivated by the futures expiry on Friday, as well as by investor sentiment primed for a move after the recent consolidation. And maybe – just maybe – it has something to do with mounting excitement over the upcoming bitcoin halving, expected in just over two weeks. (Download our recent report on the bitcoin halving for analysis of its potential impact.)      In the news, new crypto asset products keep flowing thick and fast, while increasing attention is being paid to enterprise applications including the handling of data in a post-COVID-19 world as well as central bank digital currencies. And DeFi continues its process of growing up.       Outside the crypto space, things are getting even weirder as disinfectant manufacturers plead with us not to inject their products, and traders eye their bathtubs and kitchen pots for possible oil storage. Tensions are rising in Europe as Italy, the European Union's third-largest economy, has been pity-spared a drop to junk bond status. Asian markets are dealing with the suspense over North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un’s health and the unrelated threat of a second wave of contagion. Markets are reeling between relief things aren’t even worse and fear they will be, with a dose of denial thrown in.      Bitcoin has outperformed the S&P 500 so far this week, month and year to date, although gold and long-term government bonds have done significantly better so far this year.      Next week will see a slew of economic indicators that will most likely be shockingly awful, but this week the futures actually went up on the news that more than four million people applied for benefits, because it seems confirmation of bad news is somewhat reassuring. You do have to wonder when the penny will drop that indices suspended from reality don’t stay afloat forever. On the other hand, some economies are tentatively eyeing a re-opening of some sort, which will bring a welcome if tentative respite to restive animal spirits.    Chain links    The Economist magazine dives into the options available to governments trying to figure out how to guide their economies out of this crisis. The options, none of which look good, include following the “financial repression” policies of the post-war economies of the previous century, which could take the form of capital controls, fixed exchange rates, rationed bank lending and caps on interest rates. It acknowledges such changes would be “politically demanding,” but that these are politically demanding times. “But if governments did enact such changes,” it goes on, “they would spur responses unavailable to investors of the 1950s and 1960s, such as investment in cryptocurrencies and other immaterial products.” TAKEAWAY: Exactly. The modern economy has gone through hardship before that required ideological sacrifices, but not at a time when there were alternatives to central bank currencies, and not at a time when it was possible to move wealth without using the established system. Does that make governments weaker at the expense of empowered citizens? Or could the governments use cryptocurrencies to become empowered themselves?      I’ve mentioned in this newsletter before that I worry about a sustained uptick in inflation once we have emerged from the worst of this crisis, and how that could be good for bitcoin’s value given its limited supply. But what if I’m wrong and we enter a world of deflation? Does that mean bitcoin will underperform? Not necessarily. The resulting boost in its purchasing power and its parallels to gold, which has traditionally done well in times of deflation, could give it fuel to outperform. TAKEAWAY: Bitcoin was born during the last financial crisis, so its reactions and correlations have not been tested. We do not know under which scenario it will perform best, and economic theory can justify swings either way.      Crypto asset platform Coinbase describes the current stablecoin landscape, with a focus on use cases. TAKEAWAY: The power of stablecoins to encourage liquidity, facilitate transactions and act as collateral is just beginning to be understood. The growth this year is likely to continue to be staggering, driven largely by both transaction demand and a surging global demand for dollars, of which stablecoins are a relatively convenient and liquid representation. (For more on this topic, see Michael Casey’s newsletter, “Money Reimagined,"" from last week.)      A research paper funded by University of California Berkeley’s Haas Blockchain Initiative concludes stablecoin issuances do not push up the price of cryptocurrencies. TAKEAWAY: This contradicts a controversial paper from last year that aimed to prove tether manipulated the bitcoin market. The new paper separates tether in circulation from tether held in treasury, and shows the stablecoin’s premium to the dollar depends largely on the market volatility.      More nuance on last week's news that Renaissance Technologies has submitted regulatory filings showing its flagship fund Medallion can invest in bitcoin derivatives – as we hinted last week, it’s not as bullish as the media initially painted it. TAKEAWAY: My colleague Ian Allison asked several industry insiders for their take on the news. All agree Renaissance is not necessarily going “long bitcoin.” The story and the potential are not what drives their decisions; those are based on algorithmically generated numbers.      Starbucks and McDonald's are reportedly among 19 restaurants and retail shops that will be involved in testing China's central bank digital currency in the country's Xiong'An new district. TAKEAWAY: Why is this potentially relevant for portfolios? Because mandated change is usually more powerful in overcoming resistance to new habits than the pull of innovation on its own. A national digital currency would get people comfortable with the idea of digital wallets, for instance, and from there it’s a relatively short step to incorporating other tokens and services. This is potentially significant because of its indirect relevance to the adoption of crypto assets in one of the largest economies, in which almost one billion people have a smartphone.      Wolfie Zhao walks us through changes to the bitcoin mining industry in China over the past year, going into the impact of the coronavirus, how the March crash shifted sentiment, and the outlook for the new machines hitting the market. TAKEAWAY: As we talked about in our Halving Report, the bitcoin mining industry is not only fascinating, it’s fundamental for the health of the network. Shifts in technology, economic conditions and political environment determine profitability which in turn impacts the protocol’s resilience. For more on this intriguing sector, at the intersection between business priorities, technological innovation and ideology, check out Christine Kim’s podcast series on miner economics.      The CFTC has given crypto startup Bitnomial Exchange approval to offer physically settled futures and options contracts. TAKEAWAY: Not that long ago a lot of us got excited about the pending launch of physically delivered derivatives on Bakkt, which ended up having a disappointing launch and an even more disappointing trading record. Bitnomial’s fee and margin structure might end up being more attractive to investors and traders, but, unlike Bakkt, for now it lacks the blue-chip backing of a market incumbent.      Crypto asset and blockchain data provider Amberdata lays out a detailed explanation of the stock-to-flow (S2F) model that predicts a bitcoin price of $100,000 by the middle of 2021. TAKEAWAY: The S2F model has adherents and skeptics – it seems to hold historically, but that’s not generally a good basis for forward investing, especially in these strange times. Check out our Halving Report for a look at some competing theses. The bottom line is the bitcoin market is so different now than during the previous halvings that no one knows what features or developments will carry more weight in price impact.      Vishal Shah, founder of bitcoin derivatives exchange Alpha5, points out that, with 100x leverage available on some exchanges with relatively light oversight, bitcoin won’t interest “traditional” capital, especially in these uncertain times. TAKEAWAY: It’s unlikely that 100x leverage is actually used by most traders, however – the few brave souls that do so are likely to get wiped out pretty soon, leaving the more sensible traders who push the boat out to maybe 35x, if that. “100x leverage” is more a worrisome marketing gimmick than a wealth accumulation strategy.      Security token platform Openfinance has asked its users for revised terms to defray costs in a bid to avoid having to suspend trading. TAKEAWAY: After intensifying in 2018, interest in security tokens has been muted over the past year or so because investor demand failed to materialize and contract frictions set back some high-profile projects. This development is an extension of the damped enthusiasm but should not be taken to mean that the concept has no merit. It’s early, the advantages so far have not been enough to overcome inertia and the fact that traditional markets are more liquid and have greater regulatory assurances. Given the recent market stress exposing a range of fault lines, though, we might – once things start to settle down a bit – start to see a renewed interest in an alternative capital markets system.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | MARKET | TRADING,Noelle Acheson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/27/crypto-long-short-how-oil-going-negative-could-open-the-door-for-bitcoin-etfs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/43c42a19f4e23c6d63446aeb47ee12a79be889b9-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
