42386171,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBRd1x,1615501838,The Graph to Host Protocol Governance on Decentralized GitHub Alternative Radicle,"Web 3.0 analytics and querying platform The Graph announced Radicle, a peer-to-peer software building stack, will host its governance protocol, the Graph Improvement Proposal (GIP) Process. All future protocol governance will also be hosted on Radicle, which is akin to a decentralized GitHub.    The GIP process is meant to make sure protocol upgrades are frictionless and to allow the decentralized community and stakeholders to contribute to the overall development of the Graph protocol.  It lays out how contributors can propose an idea and provides a methodology for the The Graph Council, which governs The Graph Foundation’s Treasury, to assess not only if proposals are viable but also the level of community support from indexers, delegators, curators, and subgraph developers.  Radicle can be seen as a decentralized peer-to-peer version of a platform like GitHub, but without the middlemen or, ultimately, centralized control.  Radicle does not have any centralized servers and therefore cannot be unilaterally censored.  The Radicle protocol participants enable collaborative permissionless code, and the process of editing and merging code requests is decentralized.  According to a blog post announcing the development, “The GIP process includes both the stages and acceptance criteria that a proposal hits as it is fleshed out in The Graph’s Radicle repo.”  “Radicle is putting developers back at the heart of code collaboration and providing an alternative to the centralized gatekeepers and data silos that control most git repositories today,” said Brandon Ramirez, co-founder at The Graph, in the blog post.  “This strongly aligns with The Graph’s vision of an open internet built on public infrastructure and was the natural choice for the GIP process.  The two projects have future plans to collaborate, including “storing subgraph repositories on Radicle and indexing Radicle projects using The Graph.”  “Radicle was designed with decentralized communities like The Graph in mind and its core properties of security, sovereignty, and permission-less nature make a great fit,""said Eleftherios Diakomichalis, co-founder of Radicle in the post.

42433907,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP6Dxh,1615499626,"Start9 Labs to Build on Its Self-Sovereign, Private Internet Solutions With $1.2M in Funding","Most people never even see the server that runs the internet network in their houses. But Start9 Labs is working to change that with its latest upgrades to the Embassy Server, a self-sovereign, private internet server and operating system for your home.      It’s an ambitious project to make self-sovereign computing viable for consumers, but one that offers a way out of the centralized internet people know.      To expand on their efforts, Start9 Labs recently closed a $1.2 million funding round spearheaded by Collider Ventures, Ten31 and Erik Voorhees, CEO of the decentralized exchange ShapeShift. The money will drive additional Embassy developments including additional apps for its decentralized app store, further open-source development by contributors and the “killer of all messaging apps.”      ""Self-sovereignty in a digital age is impossible when all applications and data are served by a handful of centralized custodians,” said Voorhees. “Start9 is building an ambitious alternative and it’s arriving upon the world stage at just the right time.""    Creating a self-sovereign, private internet network    Start9 Labs’ Embassy server and operating system (OS) creates its own private internet network. It comes with its own operating system as well as an expanding range of services such as bitcoin transactions, messaging and password management that cut out middlemen and use the Tor network to communicate.      Read more: Start9 Labs Pitches a Private At-Home Server. And It Works      Start9 Labs is not building on Web 2.0; rather, it is hijacking that existing infrastructure so people can run their own private networks. To build a new internet from the ground up would require a physical hardware device in every single home Hill told CoinDesk last year. The Embassy OS and server is hosted on Raspberry Pi delivered preset by Start9, or it can be set up on its own by any user, given the OS is open source.      What makes the Embassy interesting is it takes a generalized approach to running self-hosted software in an easy-to-use way. While terms such as “sovereign computing” and “self-hosted server” might seem opaque to the general public, the Embassy lets users set up a server and make it easy to use. It’s pretty much a plug-and-play device.      Internet service providers (ISPs), such as Verizon, for example, have some of the most invasive views into, and surveillance of, network traffic on the networks they provide. They’re hard to escape because there are only a handful of companies in the U.S., for example, that offer internet services.      Privacy and independence are hard to achieve in such an environment, particularly for people in authoritarian countries where private internet services would be a boon to its citizens. Self-sovereign computing offers one way around these methods of control.      There aren’t huge profits to be made in this area, and that’s what makes the funding round important. It’s rare to see hundreds of thousands dollars being put behind an entirely new ecosystem like this.    Where the Embassy is headed    Since launching in January 2020, the availability of services has only expanded.      “The 0.3.x architecture is radically different from 0.2.x,” said Matt Hill, co-founder of Start9 Labs. “It introduces external drive support, such that Embassy users can choose which service to install on which drive and use as much space as they want. This also results in dramatically faster sync times.”      A marketplace redesign will also allow users to search for new services by category, such as ""Bitcoin/Lightning,"" ""Messaging,"" ""Storage,"" ""Social, and ""Blockchains."" Start9 Labs’ software development kit makes it easy for anyone to package a service for distribution on the Embassy Marketplace, meaning Start9 will become less and less involved with the service roadmap.      “For instance, both Monero and Haven will soon be available, thanks entirely to their enthusiastic communities,” said Hill. “We believe very strongly that people should be able to run whatever software they want to run on their own server.”      See also: Becoming Self-Sovereign: How to Set Up a Bitcoin Node, With Lightning      ""Bitcoin's vision of sovereignty is not complete without a computing platform that makes it easy to run a node alongside other self-hosted software,” said Ofer Rotem of Collider Ventures. “Start9 Labs has developed this platform with great [user experience], and is a great fit for our thesis and portfolio. We are excited by their progress so far, and for what's to come.”    A hundred services by end of year    Hill expects upward of 100 services to be available on the Marketplace by the end of the year. He said the biggest deal of Q2 is Matrix, “the killer of all messaging apps.”      “Matrix is the holy grail of messaging: an open, federated protocol that can accommodate all the advanced messaging and voice/video features consumers are accustomed to, but with no third-party servers, no middlemen, no chance of corruption in the form of back doors or censorship, totally self-served and accessible over a private, end-to-end encrypted, onion-routed channel,” said Hill.      Start9 Labs is also planning to introduce Tor relay-node functionality into the Embassy itself, meaning users can choose to have their Embassy serve as a Tor relay node. That would allow users to get fast initial load times when connecting to the websites of their Embassy while simultaneously enhancing the robustness and efficiency of the Tor network itself.      “We are about to flood the Tor network with thousands of new relay nodes, making Tor bigger and faster than ever,” said Hill.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | XMR,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/03/11/start9-labs-to-build-on-its-self-sovereign-private-internet-solutions-with-12m-in-funding,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1b4186ec38276b5e8871362582e5b4f3cee6dbb5-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Climbing 2.11% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $54,323.61-$57,632.81 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC trades above its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the hourly chart, a bullish signal for market technicians.    The bitcoin market is back in bull mode but for one key attribute, almost like a missing tooth: low trading volume.      Bitcoin’s price on Thursday extended its winning streak to a seventh day as a renewed appetite for risk-taking in traditional markets sent U.S. stocks to new record highs. The catalyst was a U.S. government report on Wednesday showing a slower-than-expected inflation rate in February, which assuaged investors’ concerns that fast-rising consumer demand might send prices shooting higher as the economy reheats.

Overall, that creates upwards pressure.”      Kruger warned that investors should stay cautious in the short term before the Federal Reserve’s meeting next week, when U.S. central bank officials led by Chair Jerome Powell are expected to clarify their latest thinking on monetary policy.

While giving the annual National Budget Debate address before the national legislature on March 9, Jamaica’s Minister of Finance, Nigel Clarke, announced the CBDC will be piloted in December ahead of launch.      The government of Jamaica views the accelerated transition to a digital society and economy as vital to economic recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic, Clarke said, adding that a CBDC can greatly improve financial inclusion by making financial services available to the Caribbean nation’s unbanked population.      “It is therefore the policy of this government, Madame Speaker, to introduce a central bank digital currency,” Clarke said, addressing the Speaker of the House.      He also clarified that a CBDC issued and backed by the central bank of Jamaica (BoJ) is not a cryptocurrency.      “It is not to be confused with cryptocurrency, which is privately issued and not backed by a regulatory authority,” Clarke said.      The CBDC will be legal tender and interchangeable with the Jamaican dollar in cash on a one-to-one basis, according to Clarke.      Last month, the governor of the Bank of Jamaica, Richard Byles, said the bank had been laying the groundwork for cabinet approval of the initiative for the last couple of months. At Tuesday’s budget debate, Clarke said “procurement of the system” had been approved by the cabinet the previous day.      Jamaica has been working on a CBDC project since early 2020. In May 2020, the Bank of Jamaica tweeted it is researching CBDCs internally as it introduced its new fintech regulatory sandbox. The following month, the bank formally invited interested CBDC providers to “develop and test potential CBDC solutions” in its sandbox.      According to Clarke, with the government-issued CBDC, households and businesses will be able to make payments and store value at no cost, while customers can do business with other people directly using their mobile phones, bringing “tens of thousands of Jamaicans” into the formal financial system.      “You’re going to be able to pay for the sky juice, Madame Speaker, with your phone,” Clarke said, referring to the colorful shaved ice beverage sold by street vendors in Jamaica.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/11/jamaica-to-pilot-cbdc-later-this-year,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a6eeb06882f1da056917c7406dd14117bbdc6358-1500x851.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433906,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP6Dzh,1615489063,Bitcoin Leaves Social Media Stocks 'in the Dust' With Market's Inflation Pivot,"Bitcoin (BTC) is proving its flexibility as an investment, rising along with tech and social-media stocks when those securities are rallying and still managing to eke out gains when traditional-market investors suddenly go cold on the technology trade, according to ByteTree Chief Investment Officer Charlie Morris.      The secret? Bitcoin's investment narrative deftly shifted toward its potential use as an inflation hedge as a risk-off mood in recent weeks on Wall Street triggered a retreat from tech stocks and related investments such as Cathie Wood's ARK Innovation exchange-traded fund.      ""Bitcoin enjoys the current macroeconomic environment as it is a hard asset that benefits from rising inflation,"" Morris wrote Wednesday in a weekly newsletter. ""It also likes risk-on conditions, which are reflected by rising bond yields. In contrast, tech prefers risk-on conditions when inflation is low, often described as 'goldilocks.'""      The discussion fits into the broader investment questions surrounding bitcoin, a 12-year-old asset (and technology) whose price seems to just keep going up. It's nearly doubled already this year after quadrupling in 2020 and doubling the year before that. Is it a digital version of gold? An alternative to government currencies? A commodity? A unit for peer-to-peer payment? A decentralized network? Just something to speculate on? Estimating its value or even simply trying to pinpoint its essence can be elusive.      Bitcoin has proven in the past to be remarkably correlated with social media stocks, according to Morris. So it might stand to reason that, recently, as the stocks have retreated amid concerns that higher bond yields might hit earnings or reduce the appeal of risky investments, bitcoin might take a hit as well.      Instead, investors pivoted to reemphasizing bitcoin's potential worth as an inflation hedge, and prices for the cryptocurrency have continued to rise.      As of Thursday, bitcoin had gained for seven straight days, its longest winning streak this year, with prices currently around $57,500, just shy of the all-time high above $58,000 reached last month.      “I have long argued that bitcoin has links to tech and social media stocks in particular,"" Morris wrote. ""That’s hardly a revelation, nor controversial, because bitcoin is a network effect situation that rose from the internet.""    Will Bitcoin detach itself from tech? This is the most important question.Charlie Morris, chief investment officer, ByteTree    Investors are now seeing bitcoin as both an inflation hedge and risk asset – a double positive that could break its correlation with tech stocks.      “Tech stocks are expected to make huge profits in the future. If those profits are inflated away, that’s less interesting than in a hard money environment,” Morris says. Bitcoin ""benefits from rising inflation. It also likes risk-on conditions, which are reflected by rising bond yields.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Damanick Dantes,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/11/bitcoin-leaves-social-media-stocks-in-the-dust-with-markets-inflation-pivot,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8e687c3217e2efa932362e5ed821ef14925ca984-1732x1026.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433896,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP6Dfh,1615487006,People Keep Tokenizing Other Users' Art. Here's How Artists Can Protect Their Work,"Art theft is nothing new: As long as artists have posted their work online, thieves have appropriated them to try and profit off others’ work. Now, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), in theory a tool to give artists greater control over their creations, might be making it easier for malign actors to sell other people’s art.      This matters, not least because there is real money at stake. NFTs continue to draw headlines, with one selling for nearly $70 million Thursday in an auction on Christie’s. Smaller sales on various platforms continue as well, with NFT creators selling everything from jokes in tweet format to pieces of art – including art they didn’t actually create.      Numerous Twitter users have reported seeing their art appear on NFT platforms, minted by “fans” online.      While NFTs may look like the WIld West, artists do have legal protections when their work is stolen, said Collins Belton, managing partner at Brookwood P.C.      “There’s your standard copyright and [intellectual property] laws that apply to these things,” Belton said. Users who believe their art is being appropriated can try filing Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedown notices against the sites selling these NFTs, Belton said.      The DMCA was passed in 1998 for the specific issue of addressing the dissemination of copyrighted material online.      “If these content creators do own valid copyrights … then they could just go to these platforms and send them DMCA takedown requests. Eventually, people would decide it’s not worth dealing with right now,” he said.      Olta Andoni, an attorney with Zlatkin Wong LLC, noted that artists or other copyright holders have to make sure they file these takedown notices to the right parties, whether that is to the creator of the NFT or to the platform facilitating the sale.      Read more: State of Crypto: It’s Time to Talk About NFTs and Intellectual Property Law      ""It is up to the platform to ensure that the transfer of rights between the artists and the creator still protects the artists’ rights,” she said.      Belton said that while he believes tokenizing others’ art is unlikely to last as a trend, NFTs as a unique unit will continue.      “I don’t think selling isolated tweets of random 20-follower accounts is the future of this technology. Out of the absurd often comes real innovation. Just like CryptoKitties led to [NBA] Top Shot, I imagine tokenized tweets will lead to something else,” he said.    Legal protections    For those who do own the rights to the work they’re selling, it’s important to specify what it is they’re actually giving to buyers, Andoni said. For example, do buyers own the rights to the underlying art or just to a digital representation? And how can they resell the NFT or transfer the rights to it?      That could mean the platforms facilitating NFT sales have to structure their smart contracts to clearly include the rights that are being transferred.      “If we do not have an agreement on what the creators are giving and what the buyers are buying, this space is not going to offer the benefits we expect to,” she said.      Buyers and sellers should watch for both contractual and statutory rights, said Belton.      At present, it is legal to sell physical artworks if you own or have purchased, for example, a painting, Andoni said. Under the first sale doctrine enshrined in copyright law, anyone can sell an artwork after they’ve purchased it, without the artist’s permission. However, this might not apply to NFTs, as they are intangible, not tangible works.      Read more: NFTs: A Legal Guide For Creators and Collectors      It's not just art that is being tokenized, and users have more than just copyright law to watch out for.      Those creating NFTs should also watch out for the terms and conditions on the various services they use. Twitter, for example, would appear to prohibit others from permanently archiving tweets in its developer terms.      It’s unclear whether or how the platform would enforce these rules when it comes to tokenizing tweets, particularly given Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s auctioning of his first tweet as an NFT.      “If you look at Twitter’s terms, there’s a pretty good argument that even Jack’s activity was probably prohibited,” Belton said. “Obviously he’s the CEO but … if you squint you could say it’s not a commercial use, it’s a personal use but I’m not really sure how strong that argument would be or should be.”      A Twitter spokesperson did not return a request for comment.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/03/11/people-keep-tokenizing-other-users-art-heres-how-artists-can-protect-their-work,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7c94ff31f3cefa648e4d84cd6c6f6f3e951e0eab-1500x1005.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""We're not really short on funds. We're surviving OK and we're growing very healthily and organically so we don't have any plans for an IPO,"" he said.

Throughout the following 12 months of misery, misinformation and great societal change, the cryptocurrency industry has emerged to be fairly robust. The core stricture of decentralization – of money, of governance and of information – has been thoroughly vetted and found useful, if not, correct.      Societal change has been both small- and large-scale, from the acceleration of e-commerce and work from home to the loss of trust in experts and institutions. As we continue to adapt to this new world, whether permanent or temporary, crypto will play an increasingly important role.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    It shouldn’t be interpreted as gloating to say that some of crypto’s loudest proponents were early to sound the alarm on the novel coronavirus. Calls to “prepare for the worse” encouraged many crypto firms to preemptively switch to remote work. Some, like soon-to-go-public Coinbase, plan never to return to the office.      But it’s not just work that has gone digital. Under lockdown and other pandemic precautions shopping, socializing and entertainment have all become increasingly web-mediated. So has our awareness of the extractive nature of centralized internet businesses.      Deplatforming has been a far-too-common occurrence across the ideological spectrum, while researchers are increasingly cognizant that the perils of misinformation are directly related to the market structure of centralized internet monoliths. Tech backlash has taken many different forms, though one recent survey found that large majorities of people in the U.K. and U.S. support greater tech regulation.      Google, Zoom and Amazon have boosted returns, in some sense at the loss of consumer privacy and choice. These firms make their money through trading user data. And while they’ve become essential to daily life, they’re also fragile and prone to exploitation.      Decentralized alternatives to basic web services have yet to gain a foothold in the wider world. It remains to be seen whether this interconnected arena of protocols and apps, sometimes called Web 3.0, will be resistant to annoying occurrences like Zoombombing or even the more pressing threat of mis- or disinformation. But it will provide a genuine escape pod from the current web.      Censorship-resistance, user-owned data, persistent and securely pseudonymous digital identities have become important in a world where anyone can be knocked off a web platform for any reason.

42433901,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP6Drh,1615481219,NFTs: A Legal Guide for Creators and Collectors,"Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have taken the world by storm, empowered a new generation of digital artists and turned many into millionaires and household names. Beyond allowing artists to monetize their work without expensive middlemen, NFTs hold the promise of unlocking radical new ways of expression, fan engagement and information dissemination.      As valuations for NFTs continue to climb and established rights owners enter the fray, intellectual property (IP) considerations will undoubtedly take center stage. Creators and collectors are going to inadvertently give up rights if they are not familiar with basic IP law. They can also get into serious trouble if they unintentionally violate the rights of others. Further, they need to read between the lines of the marketplaces on which they launch. We don't want to replace one traditional middleman with another blockchain middleman.    Amy Madison Luo is general counsel of Centre, an international standards-setting body for fiat-backed stablecoins such as USDC. In her spare time she advises artists and teams working at the intersection of art, social and blockchain.    This article is intended to be a primer on some of the most important copyright considerations in the United States. It does not cover other equally relevant topics, such as trademarks and licensing considerations (including open-source and creative commons licensing), each of which warrant discussions of their own.    What do I get as a collector of an NFT?    The holder of a copyright has the exclusive right to copy, distribute, modify, publicly perform and publicly display the work. Unless specifically granted to someone else, these rights remain with the creator.      When collectors purchase an NFT, they are usually getting the right to utilize the copyrighted work depicted by the NFT for personal consumption and the “pride of ownership” of the actual NFT. The collector generally does not expect to make commercial use of the image (other than to resell the NFT). Take music, for example. The actual rights to the copyrights to the song and recording belong to the copyright owner(s) (generally the artist and/or the record label).      Depending on the marketplace, there may be additional terms attached. For example, Dapper Labs restricts the use of any purchased NBA Top Shots to “advertise, market or sell any third-party product or service.” Whereas, on its CryptoKitties platform, it specifically permits the commercial use of the purchased CryptoKitty up to $100,000 per year.      In the case of EulerBeats, a generative art platform, minters of an original NFT actually receive the exclusive right to commercialize their work, while purchasers of prints receive only the right to use, copy and display the original NFT for their own personal, non-commercial use.    How can I protect myself as a creator?    Creators face a different set of issues, including making sure they adequately protect themselves and don’t unintentionally violate IP laws that can get them in trouble.      Copyright protections kick into gear as soon as the work is “fixed in a tangible form of expression.” While registration is not required in the United States, it is necessary to bring a claim in court, to be eligible for statutory damages and recovery of attorney’s fees in successful litigation, and is generally good evidence of copyright ownership. Registration is also recommended if you have more than one creator.      See also: State of Crypto: It’s Time to Talk About NFTs and Intellectual Property Law      It is important for creators to read the terms of the marketplace they’re working with, and to make sure their rights are reserved to avoid ambiguity at a later date. Most of these marketplaces require creators to grant a right to them, broadly speaking, to use, reproduce, modify, publish, display and distribute your “content” on a worldwide, non-exclusive and royalty-free basis. Normally, this is so these marketplaces can actually post the NFT on their platform for sale, use the creation as a marketing and advertising to promote their marketplace, and occasionally embed the creation within indexes for better user experience and ease of search.      While most marketplaces limit the use to these purposes, some do not and even allow them to further sublicense these rights to third parties. This means that while creators largely retain their IP rights vis a vis the collectors of their NFT, they do specifically grant these rights to the marketplace on which they sell their art.      Furthermore, moral rights protect a creator’s right to attribution and integrity. The right of attribution refers to the right to have a work published anonymously or pseudonymously. The right of integrity prevents intentional distortion, mutilation or other modification of a work that is likely to harm the creator’s reputation and prevents the destruction of any work of recognized stature. Moral rights generally apply to single works of visual art or those produced in limited editions of 200 or fewer and signed and numbered by the artist.      See also: How NFTs Became Art, and Everything Became an NFT      Recently, a group minted a Banksy piece entitled “morons,” burned the original and sold the NFT for almost four times the original price. Banksy arguably would have a claim for copyright infringement for the commercialization of his or her work without consent. Had this been an original (rather one of 500 copies), Banksy would also have a claim for infringing on his or her moral rights.      If you see unauthorized use of your creations or an infringement of your rights in someone else’s work, most platforms have a process under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (usually found in their terms of service) where you can request the infringing content be removed.    What is fair use?    You can create anything your imagination can dream of, provided that it doesn’t infringe on the IP rights of another creator, contain illegal content and/or violate the content moderation rules of the platform you’re engaged with (including age-appropriate restrictions). Generally speaking, you can’t reproduce or create derivative works from someone else’s creation without the permission of the copyright owner. But there is one broad exception to this rule: fair use.      Fair use is an American doctrine that allows for the use of copyrighted material without the permission of the copyright owner for certain limited, “fair” purposes. At a high level, this means you can use a copyrighted work for the purposes of commentary, criticism, news reporting, teaching, research and/or parody.      See also: Burnt Banksy NFT Sells for $380K in ETH      In the NFT world, Beeple’s use of Homer and Bart Simpson or Buzz Lightyear can arguably be considered transformative works under the fair use doctrine because the artworks comment on the roles that such fictional characters play in popular culture and do not adversely impact the market for those property owners.      We’re in the equivalent of what I like to call, the “recipe printing phase of the internet.”      As we advance beyond simply minting existing media onto the blockchain and harness the real power of Web 3.0, we’re quickly going to see NFTs transform the value of data as they interact with decentralized finance, and enable novel revenue sharing arrangements and new dimensions of engagement that we’ve yet to fathom. As NFT values continue to smash records (Beeple’s “Everydays: The First 5000 Days” sells for $69.3 million), and pieces change hands in vibrant secondary markets (CryptoPunk sells for $7.5 million), the IP rights of the creators behind these works are going to be more important than ever.

(DCG, a cryptocurrency-focused investment conglomerate, also owns CoinDesk.)      Foundry's North America-based pool ranks among the 10 largest with over 4 exahashes per second of mining power, according to network data collected by BTC.com. An exahash represents a quintillion computations, or computer-generated guesses at the cryptographic puzzles that must be solved every 10 minutes or so to keep the Bitcoin blockchain running.      CEO Mike Colyer said his company wants to offer an experience ""tailor-made to fit the needs of institutional mining companies.""      Concurrent with the end of its beta phase, Foundry's pool has added Texas-based Blockcap to its growing list of clients. Using roughly 10,000 mining machines in Foundry's pool, Blockcap represents over 0.9 exahashes of computing power.      In mid-January, Foundry teamed up with Minnesota-based Compute North to launch a 14,000-machine mining facility, also targeting institutional miners.      The past six months of growth puts Foundry ""a step closer to its ultimate aim of securing a spot among the top 5 pools, which has historically been dominated by strictly China-based pools,"" according to a statement.      Last month, Foundry's pool mined 35 blocks, per the website BTC.com, and it's on pace to beat that pace in March, having already mined 22 blocks.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING,Zack Voell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/11/foundry-ends-bitcoin-mining-pool-beta-phase-adds-more-institutional-clients,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e628b5402da432e234da884a88ef97f5ace1ca32-1000x750.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433899,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP6Djh,1615477238,The Future of Everything Is Free,"Lately, free stuff has gotten a bad rap. It’s not uncommon to hear people say things like, “If you’re not paying, you’re the product not the customer.” It’s clever and thought provoking, but mostly intended as a put-down to the rubes getting their social media for free. (That includes me). But maybe it’s time to rehabilitate the idea of free stuff being a good thing, because nearly everything will be free soon.    Paul Brody is EY's global blockchain leader and a CoinDesk columnist.    I can still remember when, as a child, long-distance phone calls to family members on different continents was a special occasion for holidays and birthdays. Off-shoring information technology and outsourcing took off in the 1990s, in large part because telecommunications became so cheap as to be, for all practical purposes, free. Once phone calls and data communications were basically free, why not put developers and calls centers anywhere you can find great skills and low costs? Millions of people have been lifted out of poverty as a result.      Are phone calls really and truly free? They are not. Nor is bandwidth or CPU power, but in a very important sense, the marginal cost of additional bandwidth or compute power is really free. Once you have paid for a hard drive, for example, using space on it that was empty, really costs nothing at the margin. And in many cases, marginal costs have a much bigger impact on our behavior and our opportunities, than averages or up-front costs.      GPS is another good example of the power of truly free stuff. Because using GPS is free of charge to everyone worldwide, entire industries have been built upon this technology – there are thought to be around 8 billion GPS-enabled devices worldwide driving an economic impact of over $250 billion annually.      GPS, like social media, is also a powerful illustration of the idea that a completely free is much better than nearly free. Nearly-free things still come with transaction costs and impose cognitive load on users to figure them out, as well as operational complexity in getting payment. Nearly every user of an online social media service could afford to pay $1 annually for the service, yet charging even that small amount would result in a huge reduction in users.    Think about what your business will be like if everything is free (or very close to free).    Blockchains exist because software, CPU cycles, bandwidth and storage have at the margin, become so cheap as to be effectively free. This sounds counterintuitive when people are spending hundreds of millions on mining rigs, but those are an extreme and specialized case. Blockchains simply could not have existed in the 1960s and 1970s when my mother was programming mainframes and my father was using them for nuclear physics. Computing time was expensive and you booked it in advance.      Blockchains are an enormous waste of computing power by any reasonable historical standard. Everyone checking everyone else’s work? Insane, unless what has become free is computing power while what is valuable is trustworthy transaction processing.      When the marginal cost of computing power and connectivity approach zero, a lot of amazing things start to happen: mobile maps with turn-by-turn directions, always-available encyclopedias and phone calls that turn into all-day video hang-outs with friends and family. In competitive markets, the price of products gradually converges with the marginal cost of making them, which means that companies must constantly add more value to stay ahead of what will soon be entirely free.      See also: Paul Brody - Public Blockchains Are Set to Reshape Global Commerce      In the last year, the U.S. and quite a few other countries have embarked upon a whole new experiment in the real economy by going so far as to make money, in many respects, free. In addition to air-dropping (to borrow a blockchain term) trillions of dollars on the American public in the first COVID-19 stimulus package, interest rates remain at or near-zero in much of the world and central banks are directly injecting liquidity in the capital markets. This seems to have worked out very well.      The COVID-19 airdrop was our first-ever real experiment with what might be called trickle-up economics. It was a spectacular success. Some economists estimate that 18 million people in U.S. were saved from poverty by this package. Not everyone is on board, including many people in the blockchain community who believe free money will lead to high inflation. This did not happen in 2008 and it isn’t going to happen in 2020.      I believe scarcity should be for collectible kicks, not health care, food and education. I believe the greatest achievement blockchains have to offer to make even more things effectively free. Instead, I think the blockchain community should embrace the possibility of free capital as enthusiastically as it has embraced free software and air-drop payments.      Blockchains are about to make a lot of things that have historically been very expensive effectively free, and as a result they will transform how business and finance are done.      Initial public offerings are a good example. IPOs are expensive, ranging from hundreds of thousands of dollars to hundreds of millions when the full cost of going to market is totaled. Initial coin offerings (ICOs) did much the same thing, for a fraction of the cost. Some of these costs were related to what might be politely described as regulatory arbitrage, but much of the savings also came from bypassing the very complex system that currently controls access to public markets.      See also: Paul Brody - Why CBDCs Are Really Game-Changing      There are a few other things that blockchains are about to make much cheaper, perhaps closer to free than ever before. One of them is cross-enterprise system integration. Historically, tying together your enterprise systems with those of a supplier or partner is a project that runs into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. On a blockchain, using standardized smart contracts, it will be in the tens of dollars. This will make adding new suppliers or expanding globally a remarkably simple process.      Free capital is also transforming the world of blockchains. When the risk-free rate of return falls to zero, the attraction of taking risk suddenly goes up as investors pursue returns. Projects with more risk are now affordable, indeed, they are aggressively being pursued by investors. You can also use more capital in your projects. This is going to help speed along key technologies like optimistic rollups (a type of Ethereum scaling solution).      Optimistic rollups also benefit from near-zero capital costs and cut blockchain transaction processing costs. They tie up your capital for a week or so while the different participants verify their end of the transaction, but the lower the cost of capital the bigger the benefit of using this technology. This allows for far more transactions at a much lower cost on the Ethereum blockchain. If capital was expensive, embracing this technology would be a tough choice.      If you want to think about the future of your business, imagine what it will be like if a critical part of your business was suddenly free. And don’t stop yourself from ever thinking there are some things that cannot or will not one day be entirely free. Free labor? How would you describe the work of online reviewers? Free air travel? Have you flown with some discount airlines? The fare is nearly free because the entire trip is basically a guided tour through a series of shopping malls. I have solar panels on the roof of my house. The marginal cost of electricity on a sunny day for me is zero. Free might just work out for everyone.      So go ahead, think about what your business will be like if everything is free (or very close to free). And think about what your company will be like if you are the first to offer your product for free.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,Paul Brody,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/03/11/the-future-of-everything-is-free,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bd007399e50782ed6249ff53ce73452327da9cc9-1400x788.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433911,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP6E7h,1615476893,"Nano’s Network Flooded With Spam, Nodes Out of Sync","A transaction spamming attack has disrupted operations on the Nano network. Node operators throttled their bandwidth to deal with the issue but the network is out of sync and some transactions are obstructed, according to social media and Discord reports.      NANO is a cryptocurrency that uses so-called direct acyclic graphs (DAG), not blockchain, to settle transactions across the network. Unlike a blockchain, which includes one unified and continuous transaction history, Nano’s DAG ledger consists of multiple branches of asynchronous transaction histories.      The coin’s design guarantees very low transaction fees. But as evidenced by this attack, this comes at a cost of decentralization and Sybil resistance.      In Nano’s Discord on Thursday morning, users complained about unconfirmed transactions and out-of-sync block explorers.      “I've [sent] some nano this morning. Nault [wallet] reports it as sent. Destination hasn't confirmed it yet. ‘While the account address is valid, no blocks have been published to its chain yet. If NANO has been sent to this account, it still needs to publish a corresponding block to pocket the funds.’ What does this mean? Normally it shows up within minutes,” one user asked Nano’s Discord support channel.      The team for PlayNano, a Nano online casino, noted a discrepancy in block data between the two nodes they run.      Per an unverified Reddit post, the trouble began when Nano’s network was flooded with near-zero value transactions. In response to this, Nano’s creator, Colin LeMahieu, told node operators to lower their bandwidths to accept fewer incoming transactions.      This has resulted in effectively stymying the network, one Nano user, hanzyfranzy, suggests in the post:      “So yes, the network is globally down right now. Probably unlikely to change until node operators change their configs. Some transactions are getting through, but it's a small trickle.”      Nano creator Colin LeMahieu told CoinDesk that nodes were first knocked out of sync by the attack which stressed ""cpu and disk limits.""      ""Lowering the bandwidth limit,"" he said, ""preserves disk and cpu resources so they can stay in sync.""      ""The network was at a sustained 70+tps over a week and nodes were falling out of sync. When representatives lower the bandwidth cap it effectively reduces the network tps which allows them to catch up. Unfortunately the attacker was also exploiting a poor performance case in the node so resyncing is slow,"" LeMahieu continued.      LeMahieu believes the attackers targeted Nano, which has a full-time team of 5 working on it, during its v.22 release. The attackers have stopped for now and LeMahieu told CoinDesk that the network is ""slowly recovering"" but did not stipulate when it might be fully healthy again.

Investors bid up the cryptocurrency as a potential hedge against future inflation despite data showing little to worry about from the current pace of price increases.      As of 14:39 coordinated universal time (9:39 a.m. ET), bitcoin (BTC) was changing hands around $56,849, up 1.6% on the day near a two-week high. The price is approaching the all-time-high of $58,332 reached last month, and some analysts predict this rally could push bitcoin past $60,000 for the first time.      The European Central Bank on Thursday said it would accelerate a plan to buy as much as €1.85 trillion ($2.2 trillion) of bonds to keep bond yields from rising so fast that the region's economic recovery is derailed. The announcement came a day after the U.S. House of Representatives passed a $1.9 trillion relief bill, sending the bill to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature.      The largest cryptocurrency is viewed by a growing number of investors as a hedge against the potential inflationary impact of trillions of dollars of coronavirus-related economic stimulus, pumped into financial markets over the past year from governments and central banks around the world. But a recent climb in government bond yields in the U.S. and Europe had raised the question of whether central banks would tighten monetary policy to address the underlying inflation concerns, or merely use bond purchases to push yields back down. Bond yields move in opposition to their price, so extra purchasing demand for the securities usually puts downward pressure on the yields.      Read more: ECB Speeds €1.85T Stimulus Program as Lagarde Frets Over ‘Premature Tightening’      ""With the floodgates now open in terms of new liquidity for the market, we expect fresh record highs to be set for the major cryptoassets in short order,"" Simon Peters, an analyst with the trading platform eToro, said in emailed comments.      The cryptocurrency's price has almost doubled already this year after quadrupling in 2020 and doubling the year before that. The performance has garnered the attention of big investors because it's been so starkly superior to that of U.S. stocks, where the Standard & Poor's 500 Index is up just 0.7% on a year-to-date basis. Wall Street heavyweight Goldman Sachs has ranked bitcoin as the year's best-performing asset category, and the firm's chief operating officer, John Waldron, recently said that ""demand is rising"" from clients.      On Wednesday, a soft U.S. reading on consumer price increases for the month of February allayed any concern that higher inflation is imminent, prompting a drop in 10-year U.S. Treasury yields to around 1.5% and sparking a rally in assets viewed as risky, including stocks.      Despite its recent popularity as an inflation hedge, bitcoin gained, too, since it's still usually seen as a risky asset, due to the 12-year-old digital asset's notorious price volatility.

42406059,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAerd9A,1615474800,Former US Senator Joins Binance as Policy Adviser and Government Liaison,"Cryptocurrency exchange Binance has hired former U.S. senator and ambassador to China Maxwell Baucus as a government relations adviser.      The exchange announced Thursday in a press release it had hired the long-term government official to provide guidance and advice to the firm and work with U.S. regulators. The move could signal a shift in Binance’s approach to the U.S. market, which it currently doesn’t serve directly.      Baucus was an ambassador to China under former President Barack Obama between 2014 and 2017. Prior to that, he served in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives for nearly 40 years representing the state of Montana.      “His experience at the highest levels of government and intimate understanding of global regulation brings exceptional value to Binance and enhances our already strong compliance and policy team,” Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said in a statement.      While in the Senate, Baucus chaired the Committee on Finance, which oversees tax and tariff issues as well as some trade agreements.      In a statement, Baucus said cryptocurrencies could potentially drive “a revolution in how money is managed leading to a fairer and more equitable financial world.”      “Binance is one of the largest organizations involved in bringing these to the mainstream and it’s a privilege to assist in appropriately navigating the complex political and regulatory frameworks that hold the key to enabling wider adoption,” he said.      Binance doesn’t currently directly serve U.S. residents, having set up a San Francisco-based entity specifically for the purpose in mid-2019. Binance.US began operating in September of that year.      See also: Coinbase Calls Out Binance as It Bemoans Compliance Burden      The parent exchange has announced on multiple occasions that it was working to remove U.S. customers from its platform, citing its terms of use.

The accelerated bond purchases will come under the central bank's Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program (PEPP), a monetary-stimulus effort similar to the Federal Reserve's ""quantitative easing"" asset purchases in the U.S. The PEPP is set to end in March 2022, but the pace of the bond purchases will now accelerate, according to a press release from the ECB.      ""Market interest rates have increased since the start of the year, which poses a risk to wider financing conditions,"" ECB President Christine Lagarde said in prepared remarks. ""If sizable and persistent, increases in these market interest rates, when left unchecked, could translate into a premature tightening of financing conditions for all sectors of the economy.""      The extended bond purchasing program is expected to continue until the ECB Governing Council ""judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over,” the ECB said.      “Markets have been looking for clarity from the ECB in the past few weeks amid conflicting messages, and it seems as if the central bank has listened. The introductory statement now sends a clear signal that PEPP purchases will be increased through Q2, as we expected,” said Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, in an email.

42406028,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAerdB8,1615471292,OpenZeppelin's 'Defender' Gives DeFi Teams a Weapon Against Flash Loan Attacks,"OpenZeppelin, a cryptocurrency software and security firm, has just released a software suite for decentralized finance (DeFi) projects fighting against flash loan attacks and other exploits.      Defender is a software suite that provides teams with alerts when an exploit is taking place, as well as automated scripts to respond to that exploit in real time.      Since cropping up last summer, yield farming applications and other DeFi markets have populated the Ethereum blockchain and attracted billions in capital. These pools of capital have also become lucrative honeypots for cyberattacks.      Perhaps the most common is the flash loan exploit, wherein an attacker borrows tokens from several lending pools at once and uses each loan to pay down the others, all the while using the excess to extract value from other markets. To ensure the attack goes through quickly, the attacker(s) pay a much-higher-than-average transaction fee.      From Yearn to Compound to Cream, decentralized financial platforms have collectively lost nearly $150 million from these exploits since 2020.    Read more: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About the DeFi ‘Flash Loan’ Attack    Defender suite, OpenZeppelin CTO Jonathan Alexander told CoinDesk, is meant to mitigate the effects of these attacks and give teams automated tools to respond to them as they are happening – something that could help reduce losses in the future.      ""If you detect something you can notify the team, but you can also automate actions. You can call an admin function to pause the smart contract or move tokens from one place to another. Monitoring is great practice ... but now you can also respond with automated action.""    How does Defender work?    The key to Defender ensuring a proper response time to an exploit, Alexander said, is that it monitors and alters teams to exploits and offers them ready-to-deploy code to respond to the attack. These pre-coded scripts can do things like pause or upgrade a smart contract, or they can perform more menial, quotidien automated tasks, like transaction relays.      Two of the more important features, Defender Sentinel and Defender Admin, could help put a stopper in the flash loan attacks that have swindled hundreds of million in tokens in the past year.      In one $11 million exploit, Yearn attackers manipulated the exchange rate of DAI in Yearn vaults by taking out flash loans on Aave for USDT and USDC; these were then deposited into Curve Finance pools to fudge the exchange rate involving USDT, USDC and DAI, which affected the price of DAI in Yearn vaults causing liquidations and losses.      Defender would pinpoint these attacks as they are happening by scanning blocks for high transaction fees. If there’s an irregularity, the team receives a notification (on Slack, for example) and they can choose from one of Defender’s automated scripts to respond to the attack. One of these could halt all operations on chain, for instance, or blacklist addresses.      Right now, Defender can’t stop an exploit before it happens, but it could be used to stop it in its tracks before the exploiter takes off with a bunch of coins. In the future, OpenZeppelin hopes to release a version that can track malicious transactions in Ethereum’s mempool (a virtual holding tank for transactions), though this will take time.      ""We're monitoring block by block. Right as a block is mined, the Sentinels will run and fire autotasks, so we're talking about seconds reaction time. That still is after the fact,"" Alexander said, ""but quick reaction in past exploits could have saved millions of dollars.""      Whereas before response coordination to these attacks has relied on social media and message platforms, fixes took anywhere from minutes to hours. If Defender works as described, the minutes and seconds edge it gives teams in the race against the blockchain clock could add up to millions in saved funds.      In a demo shown to CoinDesk using a historical state of the Ethereum blockchain, OpenZeppelin replayed an old DeFi exploit to demonstrate Defender’s reaction and response. Alexander said that any team can replay their old exploits using the software to see how things could have gone differently.    A potential 'game changer' for flash loan mitigation    OpenZeppelin is already working with players like Yearn, dYdX, Synthetic and others to get their solution working in the wild.      “We are especially excited about being able to implement automation knowing that security best practices are built in. Above all, Defender has helped us tackle the unknown-unknowns of security so we can keep building,” said Aparna Krishnan, co-founder of Opyn, a DeFi options platform, calling the new tool a ""game changer.""      Brendan Asselstine, the CTO of prize pool DeFi protocol PoolTogether, said his platform uses Defender “to automate several aspects of our protocol” and “rely on it as a key part of our infrastructure.""      Give the rate of flash loan attacks on the DeFi ecosystem, now that Defender is launched, it may not be long before we see its capabilities in action.",POSITIVE,DAI,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | DAI,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/03/11/openzeppelins-defender-gives-defi-teams-a-weapon-against-flash-loan-attacks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/45950e4eed10a5540f1e59d47fb0962af87e67ce-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42406023,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAerd4F,1615471266,CipherTrace Releases Its FATF-Friendly AML Tools for Crypto Exchanges,"Blockchain analytics startup CipherTrace has released its anti-money laundering (AML) tool for cryptocurrency firms, called “CipherTrace Traveler.”      The CipherTrace solution is named after the so-called Travel Rule, a set of strictures that require funds over a certain amount being transferred between exchanges to be accompanied by personally identifiable information (name, date of birth, etc.) of the originator and beneficiary of the transaction.      Over two years in the making, CipherTrace Traveler is based around TRISA, or the “Travel Rule Information Sharing Alliance,” a non-profit collaboration of 150 cryptocurrency stakeholders. Traveler is aimed at all virtual asset service providers (VASPs), such as crypto exchanges, custody providers, over-the-counter trading desks, banks and other financial institutions.      “It’s a commercial offering but with an open-source and decentralized component that has involved 150 VASPs working on TRISA technical standards,” CipherTrace CEO Dave Jevans said in an interview, adding:    “There are large financial institutions that need a commercial product to base their business on, as well as many small VASPs and OTC desks that aren’t going to hire a programmer at $10,000 a month to build this stuff.”    In terms of the cost of deploying CipherTrace Traveler, Jevans said commercial arrangements work on a sliding scale, based on the size of the operation and its needs, adding that the solution is affordable for small firms.      It goes to show how far new VASP rules will reach.    Read more: Inside the Standards Race for Implementing FATF’s Travel Rule    A couple of years ago, global AML watchdog the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommended cryptocurrency service providers fall in line with the AML measures followed by the rest of the financial system, a difficult problem since crypto is pseudonymous by design.      The next FATF plenary meeting in June will see a review of progress made by countries and VASPs. While travel rule insiders emphasize this is not a hard and fast deadline, some jurisdictions, such as Singapore, already require firms to show a travel rule solution is in place, Jevans pointed out.      “As of this year, Singapore has said there’s no license if you don't have a solution,” said Jevans. “The U.S. has claimed that you should have been doing it already. However, they're also realistic and have said until there are solutions and people are using them, there’s not going to be fines for anyone, so you get a period of relaxed enforcement.”      There have been a number of proposed technical solutions, some using blockchain technology itself to create open directories of VASPs. CipherTrace Traveler and the TRISA VASP directory rely on battle-tested certificate authority technology widely used across the internet.    Read more: Group Backed by ING Bank, Fidelity and Standard Chartered Releases Crypto AML Tools    In terms of TRISA interoperability, or the extent to which the protocol can talk to other proposed travel rule solutions, CipherTrace has conducted tests with most of the other players in the market, including Switzerland’s OpenVASP, the Ethereum-based Shyft Network and the ING Bank and Standard Chartered-backed Travel Rule Protocol (TRP).      “On the TRISA side of things, I think there's pretty good interoperability with the TRP travel protocol and also a fair bit of work done with OpenVASP, the Swiss offering,” Jevans said. “When it comes to the U.S. Travel Rule Working Group, one of their members are on the TRISA weekly calls.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/03/11/ciphertrace-releases-its-fatf-friendly-aml-tools-for-crypto-exchanges,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0add337473202da6dfe7d86e85b3b44db9a3bb01-2560x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The contribution puts Nexo in line with other crypto and Bitcoin companies like Square, OKCoin, Gemini, Kraken, Coinbase and many others that have started contributing millions of dollars toward open-source development, particularly in the past year or so. The six-figure sum will go toward supporting another developer in the next round of Brink funding later this month.      ""Thanks to Bitcoin’s spectacular rally over the past months, we’ve reached that long-awaited stage where institutional investors and retail clients alike are flooding into the crypto space en masse,"" said Antoni Trenchev, co-founder and managing partner at Nexo.

Instead, they are able to donate funds to Brink, which then vets and trains developers and takes care of the grant administration.

Some crypto exchanges have already made the decision to go, Bloomberg reported Monday.  For example, Revix is shifting its head office to the U.K. and also planning a Germany-based location.  The Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) is seeking to regulate cryptocurrencies with more power to prosecute fraudsters, Head of Enforcement Brandon Topham told Bloomberg in January.  The looming changes come after the collapse of Mirror Trading Investments (MTI) in December 2020, which had collected over 23,000 bitcoin from investors before its CEO allegedly fled to Brazil.  Regulators will focus on better protection for consumers rather than businesses, according to Topham, who added more proposals are expected in coming months.  Until now, authorities in South Africa have been ""incredibly slow in terms of regulation,"" according to Sean Sanders, CEO of Cape Town-based Revix.

Investors in the Series D funding round valued the company at $3 billion, BlockFi announced Thursday. The round was co-led by Bain Capital Ventures and joined by a slew of others.      BlockFi is looking to cement itself as one of the leading lenders in the cryptocurrency industry, providing both trade execution services for institutions and opportunities for retail investors to get yield on their bitcoin holdings.      BlockFi currently has $10 billion in outstanding loans, $15 billion in total assets and has been “operating profitably for several months,” BlockFi CEO Zac Prince told CoinDesk in an interview.      The latest injection of capital will go toward doubling BlockFi’s 500-person team by the end of 2021, launching a bitcoin rewards credit card in the second quarter and expanding the focus of its retail products to markets outside the U.S., said Prince.    Read more: BlockFi Announces Early 2021 Launch for Bitcoin Rewards Credit Card    Plus, BlockFi wants to add services outside of just crypto. This could include digital securities, but Prince declined to comment further.      “I think that a crypto company or multiple crypto companies have the opportunity to replace traditional banks on a global scale for the primary banking relationship with consumers,” Prince said.      BlockFi said Thursday it has 225,000 users, up from 10,000 in late 2019.    BlockFi funding spree    With Thursday’s announcement, BlockFi has now raised more than $450 million in venture capital. The firm’s $50 million Series C was announced last August, when it had a mere $1.5 billion in crypto assets on the platform.      “We are interested in becoming a public company, and as you start to think about doing that the composition of your capital base and types of investors shifts towards folks that can consider holding their position through a public event,” Prince said of the firm’s future plans.      The new funding will also “provide capital for select acquisition opportunities,” BlockFi said in a press release.    Read more: BlockFi Raises $50M From Universities, NBA Star, Others as Crypto Lending Soars    This week, the lender came under fire on Crypto Twitter for arbitrage trading with shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).      BlockFi’s position in GBTC “is substantially less than 20%” of total assets, Prince said.      Last month, the firm launched a bitcoin trust to compete against Grayscale's offering, although it also increased its shares in GBTC in recent weeks and has used the premium on the fund to make money off arbitrage trades for its clients. (Digital Currency Group, the parent company of Grayscale, also owns CoinDesk.)

Speaking at an online event hosted by the Russian Economic School, a Moscow-based private college, Zabotkin explained the prototype would be available for people to ""kick its tires,"" but won't support any real money transactions.      ""Next year, based on that prototype and any additional developments needed, we will start testing it,"" Zabotkin said, as reported by news agency Prime on Wednesday.      The comments show that, despite the earlier controversy caused by the central bank digital currency (CBDC) project among regulators and Russia's financial industry players, the Bank of Russia is still moving forward with the idea.      ""The absolute majority of the feedback we got on our report, 83% of it, supported the idea of the digital ruble,"" the Bank of Russia's press office told CoinDesk in an email.      ""We're keeping on with the plan we earlier revealed. At this point, we're in the process of developing the design of the digital ruble, which will be public and discussed with the market participants. The decision on the launch will be made next year based on testing results,"" the press office added.      The project was unveiled in October, when the Bank of Russia published an analytical report outlining the possible design of a ruble-backed CBDC. The report suggested several scenarios for the digital ruble's operations and requested public feedback. Listed benefits of the project include the ability to track government spending more effectively and to provide digital payment options in areas where internet connections are scarce.      See also: What Is a CBDC?      Back then, Bank of Russia Chairwoman Elvira Nabiullina said it hasn't been decided yet if the digital ruble would actually be issued, but the concept was ""promising."" She also said the central bank would likely pilot the system for testing and public feedback in late 2021, and then take the decision on whether to move to a launch.      Following the publishing of the report, Russian banks and fintech companies expressed concerns the models proposed for the digital ruble were excessively centralized and could harm private banks' business, making them compete with the central bank.

In a report by Reuters on Wednesday, John Waldron said that, while Goldman was ""regulated"" on what it could do, the bank continues to ""evaluate"" bitcoin and ""engage"" with clients.      ""Demand is rising,"" said Waldron, who is also Goldman's bank president.      The comments come as the bank relaunched its cryptocurrency trading desk with the intention of supporting futures trading for bitcoin, three years after shelving plans to do so.      The move also opens the possibility for Goldman to pursue a bitcoin exchange-traded fund as it strengthens its push into digital assets. Meanwhile, the multinational investment bank has issued a request for information to explore digital asset custody, as CoinDesk previously reported.      See also: Goldman Digital Asset Lead Sees Mergers Ahead for Crypto Infrastructure Providers      Waldron said that while the bank can custody digital assets, it ""can't principal"" them and added Goldman was discussing with watchdogs how banks should be regulated in regards to digital currency, according to the report.

According to a prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Tuesday, the Simplify U.S. Equity PLUS Bitcoin ETF would invest in cryptocurrency indirectly via the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTCQX: GBTC), as well as equity securities of U.S. companies.      Up to 15% of the fund, from New York-based Simplify Exchange Traded Funds, would be invested in bitcoin, solely through the $35 billion Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, with the remainder in equities.      If approved, the ETF would trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker ""SPBC,"" and have a management fee of 0.5%. BNY Mellon would be the ETF's administrator, transfer agent, asset custodian and accountant.      In its investment strategy section, the Simplify prospectus states:    The Fund expects to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies indirectly by investing up to 15% of its total assets (measured at the time of investment) in a wholly-owned and controlled subsidiary, which is designed to enhance the ability of the Fund to obtain exposure to cryptocurrencies consistent with the limits of the U.S. federal tax law requirements applicable to regulated investment companies.    The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is the world’s largest bitcoin fund, offering investors the opportunity to gain regulated exposure to the leading cryptocurrency without having to take direct control of assets.

It turns out blockchain-based watermarks, or digital passports, to verify the authenticity of luxury items like high-value watches are a solid use case for the technology, often using the concept of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that are currently very much in vogue.      Arianee, which recently partnered with watchmaker Breitling, and whose technology is being used by Switzerland-based luxury brands conglomerate Richemont Group, did not come down with the last shower of NFTs, and has been working on its product for years. Also quietly exploring NFTs as proof of authenticity is LVMH, the French firm that owns brands like Louis Vuitton, Dior and Tiffany.    Read more: Breitling Goes Live With Ethereum-Based System to Put All New Watches on the Blockchain    The Arianee seed round will help create a track-and-trace, software-as-a-service (SaaS) offering. Previously, the startup did a token sale in 2018 and raised a little over 300 bitcoin, according to Arianee co-founder Luc Jodet. (The bitcoin raise is worth $17.1 million at current prices, though some has surely been spent.)      “It’s significant that an entity such as Bpifrance, which is partly funded by the government and also public savings, has touched tokens,” Jodet told CoinDesk in an interview. “Finally, a French public entity is recognizing the fact that tokens are something that you can invest in.”      Other investors included Cygni Labs, Noia Capital and a clutch of French tech entrepreneurs. All investors in the round are exposed to the ARIA20 utility token in addition to equity, said Jodet.      “Arianee is reinventing the customer relationship with fashion and luxury goods players through a unique value proposition based on the digital identity of an item,” Bpifrance’s Guillaume Simonaire said in a statement. “Bpifrance is very proud to support this French solution which will contribute to the acceleration of the digital and ecological transformation of our industry.”    Read more: OpenSea Adds ‘Collector Drops’ to NFT Marketplace With Shawn Mendes Wearables    NFTs, which seem to be at the heart of crypto’s latest retail renaissance, are a key part of the Arianee architecture, which the firm built some four years ago.
