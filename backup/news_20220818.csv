Follow CoinDesk Brasil on Twitter.  Ripple has introduced its crypto on-demand liquidity (ODL) service in Brazil in partnership with Travelex Bank, it announced Thursday.  The digital payment company's ODL uses XRP to accelerate the transfer and exchange of fiat currencies between countries.  Travelex is the first bank in Latin America to use ODL, Ripple said, adding that the bank was also the first one registered and approved by the Brazilian Central Bank to operate in foreign exchange.  “Brazil is a key market for Ripple given its importance as an anchor to business in Latin America, its openness to crypto and country-wide initiatives that promote fintech innovation,” Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said in a statement.  For now, Travelex will use ODL for payments between Brazil and Mexico, Travelex Bank Chief Operating Officer João Manuel Campanelli told CoinDesk, adding that the company is working to extend that service to the United States and Asia.  Other Brazilian companies including Banco Rendimento, Remessa Online, Frente Corretora, Banco Topazio and B&T Câmbio already use RippleNet, a cross-border payments system, said Ripple, which opened an office in Brazil in 2019.

42394905,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWNMk,1660859399,"Crypto Lender Celsius' Collapse Into Bankruptcy Should Be Probed, US Says","U.S. government officials asked that an independent examiner be appointed to look into crypto lender Celsius Network's collapse into bankruptcy, seeking the sort of investigation previously deployed in the high-profile restructurings of Enron and Lehman Brothers.  The U.S. Trustee office, which oversees bankruptcy matters, said there are ""numerous questions"" about Celsius' operations and its financial health, as well as how its management allowed it to enter bankruptcy, according to a court filing Thursday.  An independent probe, which the judge overseeing the case would have to approve, would answer questions about the company's financials and address ""significant transparency issues"" in the bankruptcy case, according to the filing.  ""There is no real understanding among customers, parties in interest and the public as to the type or actual value of crypto held by the Debtors or where it is held,"" the U.S. Trustee said. ""An independent examiner is necessary here to investigate and report in a clear and understandable way on the Debtors’ business model, their operations, their investments, their lending transactions, and the nature of the customer accounts to ensure public confidence in the integrity of the bankruptcy system and to neutralize the inherent distrust creditors and parties in interest have in the Debtors.""  In the controversial Enron and Lehman cases, an examiner dove into the causes of their spectacular falls. With Enron, the examiner concluded that senior officials at the Houston energy company were in ""a circle of responsibility for Enron's financial demise,"" according to a 2003 Associated Press article. As for the brokerage firm, ""Lehman Brothers used accounting sleight of hand to conceal the bad investments that led to its undoing,"" the New York Times said of a bankruptcy examiner's report in 2010.  Read more: Crypto Lender Celsius On Pace to Run Out of Cash by October  The U.S. Trustee noted that Celsius took out a third-party loan but did not identify who the lender was, what the collateral was or what kind of loan was issued. Moreover, this was even after the lender revealed it could not return the collateral.  ""No description of the types of claims the Debtors may have against this lender are made in the Mashinsky Declaration, nor is there an explanation for why legal recourse was not sought,"" the filing said, using the last name of Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky. ""There is also no description of any investigation by the Debtors into its legal recourse.""  Read more: Sky-High Yields and Bright Red Flags: How Alex Mashinsky Went From Bashing Banks to Bankrupting Celsius  Celsius' customers also do not trust the company, and have said so in filings published to the court docket, the Trustee's office said.  Appointing an independent examiner ""would be in the best interest"" of both Celsius, its creditors and equity holders, the filing said.  ""The Debtors’ professionals acknowledge many of these facts and circumstances and have provided information requested by the United States Trustee. Irrespective of such cooperation, however, the divergent interests of the various estates, the extreme financial irregularities that have taken place, and the extensive mistrust of the Debtors’ customers, all make the appointment of an independent and disinterested examiner in the best interests of creditors, equity security holders, and the bankruptcy estates,"" the filing said.  A Twitter account for Celsius' unsecured creditors tweeted that it objects to the request, saying an examiner will ""run up millions in costs when CEL should cut costs.""

42421109,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXZUMP,1660859115,"US Treasury's Tornado Cash Sanctions Are ‘Unprecedented,’ Warns Congressman","CORRECTION (Aug. 19, 8:56 UTC): Adds missing qualification clause at start of first quote; removes assertion that OFAC was wrong to sanction Tornado Cash from second paragraph.  The U.S. Treasury Department’s sanctioning of the Tornado Cash cryptocurrency mixer was an unprecedented move threatening privacy and innovation, according to one U.S. member of Congress. And he thinks Congress should start asking questions.  On CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” program Thursday, Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) lays out his concerns with the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) latest moves.  Read more: Tornado Cash Sanctions Are Spiraling Into Compliance Nightmares  “I didn't want to make it sound like I'm totally opposed to OFAC looking at this,” said Emmer. “My problem is that this software is controlled by code, not by any person or entity. So if you think about it, the sanctioning of Tornado Cash is an unprecedented shift in the Office of Foreign Asset Control in their sanctioning policy.”  “Their primary priority is protecting the United States national security,” he added. “So I think our role – Congress – can be most effective in inquiring with OFAC to find out if they believe the sanction addresses are controlled by people, not code, and what this means for privacy rights and innovation.”  The ban on Tornado Cash is driving internal debate on Capitol Hill regarding what regulatory agency should be responsible for oversight of cryptocurrencies, according to Rep. Emmer. He said government agencies now are “not doing the job they were assigned to do.”  When it comes to digital assets, it should be the job of Congress to define “what qualifies or fits the definition of cash, commodity and or a security,” and which agency should be responsible for regulating each, said Emmer.  The coin mixer’s sanction sent shockwaves across the industry, and reignited concerns about privacy and the use of open-source tools.  Congress now needs to get its “act together,” according to Emmer.  Emmer used the broadcast to once again slam the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for what he considers overreaching its authority.  Read more: CFTC Commissioner: Crypto Market Needs Clear Guidelines on Its Regulator  He said the SEC is not ""staying within their lane,"" using its position as more of a ""shakedown authority."" Emmer pointed to requests for information and subpoenas the agency has sent to crypto companies, including companies who believe they do not fall under the agency's purview.  With only 28 legislative days left this year, “it’s unlikely that any crypto legislation is going to move,” Rep. Emmer said, referring to bills clarifying which U.S. regulatory agency should oversee the cryptocurrency market. However, it’s “highly likely” next year the crypto community could finally get some sort of regulatory clarity, “so we hold not only regulators accountable, but they know what their lane is.”  Read more: Crypto-Mixing Service Tornado Cash Blacklisted by US Treasury",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/08/18/treasury-tornado-cash-sanctions-are-unprecedented-warns-us-congressman,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2667f11b25c9fbdab055c66d4c02a430a27f1f34-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Most recently, in a letter sent to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Energy (DOE), six Democrats led by Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) called the amount of energy used by miners “disturbing” and requested that the two groups require more reporting on emissions and energy consumption from the crypto mining industry.  The latest letter acknowledges that some miners are mitigating their need for excess amounts of energy by investing in renewable sources of power. However, they argued that some of the largest crypto mining companies in the country are still primarily relying on the electrical grid for their power, which can increase peak demand and potentially incentivize new fossil fuel generators.

42394919,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWNWa,1660854746,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Pauses Losing Streak but the Trend Is Still Not Bullish,"Price Action  BTC Pauses Its Recent Fall, Albeit Barely  Bitcoin’s price (BTC) increased 0.3% on Thursday, ending a streak of four consecutive negative days. Average trading volume was higher than usual. Prices initially declined 0.5% as U.S. equity markets opened in New York at 9:30 a.m. ET.  Ether’s (ETH) price rose 1.5% as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, outperformed bitcoin. Altcoins were mixed, with EOS falling 7% while SOL and ATOM increased 0.1% and 4%, respectively.  This article originally appeared in Market Wrap, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  In macroeconomic news, 250,000 Americans filed initial jobless claims for the week ended Aug. 13, falling short of expectations of 265,000. The four-week average for initial jobless claims dropped 2% to 246,750, falling short of forecasts of 257,000 jobless claims. The unexpectedly strong job figures offer the latest evidence the U.S. economy remains strong, even as other indicators show growth is slowing. Investors have been hoping recent U.S. Federal Reserve hawkishness will lick inflation without setting off a dramatic recession.  In line with the positive economic news, traditional markets were higher, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq index up 0.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and S&P 500 up 0.03% and 0.3%, respectively.  In commodities, crude oil’s price rose 2% while natural gas’ fell 0.1%. Gold, the traditional safe-haven asset, recently fell in price by 0.2%.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Technical Take  BTC Maintains Break Below Trendline; Small and Large Speculators Hold Steady  Bitcoin has broken below its trendline and continues to trade below $24,000.  The decline in BTC’s ATR (Average True Range) shows the reduction in BTC volatility, despite this week’s downward price trend.  ATR is a market volatility indicator that measures the spread of the opening, high, low and closing price of an asset over time. An expansion of ATR indicates increased volatility while a contraction in ATR implies reduced volatility.  BTC’s current price moves cluster around a high-volume node when plotting prices against the Volume at Price (VAP) indicator. A “node” refers to a cluster of volume around a price level. The VAP allows users to view areas where prices have occurred the most over a period of time. High-volume nodes indicate areas of widespread agreement. Low-volume nodes, by contrast, illustrate areas where trades are less likely to occur. The VAP is used in the same manner as the Visible Range Volume Profile (VRVP) referenced in earlier Market Wraps this month.  High-volume nodes can also highlight areas where prices are prone to stay for extended periods, resulting in little overall price movement. They may signal that BTC is set to trade flat in the near future.  Overlaying this Tuesday’s Commitment of Traders (COT) report with today’s chart shows that speculators both small and large are in a holding pattern. Published by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the weekly COT report provides a snapshot of positions held by traders in futures markets.  Positions of large speculators (i.e., asset managers) are denoted in green, while positions of small speculators (i.e., retail investors) are denoted in blue. In the July 11 Market Wrap it was noted that retail investors were becoming net long as they breached the center line (0.0). Large speculators became net short during that identical time period.  Since July 26, both speculator groups have shown little movement in their net positions. The market could be waiting for large speculators to add to their long positions as a sign BTC will rise again.  ETH continues to outpace BTC  While bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, generates the most attention, ETH’s price movement continues to outperform. The ETH/BTC price chart highlights a 45% move higher since July 13.  The increase stems partly from investor anticipation of The Merge, which will shift the Ethereum blockchain from “proof-of-work” to a faster, more energy efficient “proof of stake” protocol. Market participants also expect the conversion to have a deflationary impact on ETH, reducing its supply. Historically, the reduction of an asset’s supply leads to a higher valuation.  The increase has occurred on moderate volume, and ETH’s 10-day exponential moving average remains above both its 20- and 50-day EMAs, an indicator of bullish sentiment.  Arca Chief Investment Officer Jeff Dorman suggested in a note that ether’s price surge reflects investors’ belief in its wider usefulness.  “That ETH is the most pure play, generic way to express a ‘growth of blockchain’ theme, while BTC is now just a macro trade,” Dorman said. “Investors don’t care how blockchain succeeds, they just want to make money if it does – ETH gives exposure to smart contracts, [decentralized finance], Web3, [non-fungible tokens] and gaming.

Is Filecoin Network's Incentive Plan Sustainable? Crypto Analysts Want to Know  By Jimmy He  Filecoin is a blockchain project launched in 2020 to decentralize the data storage business, providing an alternative to industry giants like Amazon (AMZN) at nearly a thousandth of the cost.  At its core, the network connects storage providers with clients looking to stow their data. By offering storage space – ranging from extra capacity on desktop computers to large racks – and then running mathematical proofs to show that clients’ data is unaltered, providers can earn the network’s native FIL token as a blockchain reward.  Recently, activity has been increasing. According to a Messari report, active Filecoin storage deals between providers and clients surged 128% from the first quarter to the second quarter of 2022.  That has crypto analysts highlighting the incentive program offering storage providers 10 times the block reward that is linked to 99.7% of that growth – Filecoin Plus (Fil+) – and wondering whether it's sustainable.

The fund opened with just internal capital during what may end up being the depths of the bear market in the second quarter. The timing could turn out to be propitious, giving the fund the opportunity to put together an early record of outperformance, Portfolio Manager Chris Rhine and Global Head of Asset Management Steve Kurz told CoinDesk.  “The advantage of launching in an extremely volatile market is to build a track record in markets that aren't necessarily just going in a 40-degree angle up,” Rhine said, adding that the fund has been outperforming since inception in May.  The fund is on track to imminently hit $50 million in assets under management (AUM) raised from both domestic and overseas investors, said sources, with the expectation of passing $100 million by the end of the year.  “We’re looking for real fundamental stories,” said Rhine, noting that the fund will focus on larger, highly liquid cryptos for its investments, while avoiding short positions and any sort of speculative or meme-like tokens.  Unlike many current long-only products, the Liquid Alpha Fund doesn’t have any lockups on capital, and redemption frequency is monthly. Performance fees will kick in only on the alpha the fund can generate beyond the returns for bitcoin.  “What we're trying to do is to really enhance the Sharpe ratio for investors, so that they're getting more reward for every point of risk that they're taking relative to bitcoin,” Rhine said.

Funds will be used to provide blockchain infrastructure and build payment rails for financial institutions expanding operations in Central America, the company said.  “We want to remain at the forefront of redefining Latin America's financial system. A blockchain-based financial system inevitably results in faster, scalable and programmable financial products that will grant access to a broader segment of the population that is currently underserved,” Koibanx CEO Leo Elduayen said in a statement.  The company also plans to launch a beta version of a low-code platform in December to allow developers to create financial products on the blockchain, with the aim of reaching 10,000 developers by the end of 2023. The platform will include tokenization functions and integrations with crypto liquidity pools and exchanges, among other features.  The company, founded in 2015, has 70 employees in offices located in Mexico, Colombia, El Salvador, Argentina and Uruguay. It plans to open operations in Panama, Paraguay, Guatemala and Honduras in the next 18 months.  In August 2021, Koibanx signed an agreement with El Salvador’s government to develop the country’s blockchain infrastructure on top of the Algorand blockchain.

Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Have Dumped A Noticeable Amount In The Last Few Months According to the latest weekly report from Glassnode, the BTC LTHs have observed a sustained decrease of 150k BTC since the crash in May. The &apos;long-term holder&apos; (or LTH in brief) group is the Bitcoin cohort that includes all those investors who have been holding onto their coins since at least 155 days ago, without selling or moving them. The holders who sell earlier than this threshold are called the short-term holders (STHs). LTHs are generally the most resolute investors in the market and thus large selling from them doesn&apos;t happen too often.

42393786,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpAzTR,1660848634,"As SEC Leans on Enforcement to Regulate, Crypto Lawyers Study Every Word","What makes a crypto token a security? It’s the central question plaguing the industry, and while the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission isn’t volunteering an answer, the agency has showed some of its hand in enforcement documents crypto lawyers are studying like scripture.  A complaint against a company selling an alleged unregistered security this week – Dragonchain and its DRGN token – follows on the heels of a more expansive document last month in which the agency spent dozens of pages explaining how AMP and eight other cryptocurrencies should be registered securities. This stream of enforcement language offers a rudimentary guide for other companies wary of the same finding, according to interviews with several industry advisers.  The stakes are high, because any token that’s a security would need to be registered with the SEC and be traded on regulated exchanges – an infrastructure that doesn’t really exist, yet.  The agency is often accused of trying to regulate the digital-assets sector through the contours of how it punishes crypto companies. The SEC reinforced that notion when it used the innards of an insider-trading case against a former Coinbase (COIN) manager to tell the world that the tokens the insider and his associates were allegedly trading are, in fact, securities.  The notice had two immediate effects: Crypto platform Binance.US dumped the trading of the first one on the list, AMP, and industry lawyers began combing through the text of the SEC complaint to learn more about how the agency is interpreting securities laws for crypto.  “The lack of a clear and comprehensive regulatory framework in the U.S. is one of the biggest obstacles to this industry’s development,” said Dario de Martino, a partner at Allen & Overy.  The agency keeps regulating by enforcement, he said, but at least the Coinbase complaint “provides further insights into the SEC’s view.”  The Dragonchain case  You can’t have securities fraud without securities. For the SEC to move against an issuer, it first has to make a legal argument that a token is definitely a security, as it did in the Dragonchain action on Tuesday.  The Seattle-based company was targeted for its sale of dragon (DRGN), an initial coin offering (ICO) that was first pushed several years ago and that raised more than $16 million.  The SEC set out a claim that the firm made the case that the assets would increase in value and corralled online influencers to encourage investments. Those are hallmarks in the SEC’s view of tokens that are operating as securities without being registered and providing investors with the information they need.  Dragonchain countered the SEC’s position in a document posted online in May, which the company offered up again this week.  Unregistered 'securities' on Coinbase  But the agency also affixed the securities label a few weeks ago on the nine tokens central to its case against former Coinbase product manager Ishan Wahi, who pleaded not guilty to related criminal charges. What’s unusual there was that the SEC argued the tokens were illegally unregistered securities – a status disputed by some issuers – but didn’t formally accuse the firms behind them of wrongdoing.  The companies are wondering what’s next, as are the platforms they trade on. And because the document is only an initial complaint, and not a more fleshed-out legal brief or a judge’s ruling that could come later, the lessons lawyers take remain broad.  Still, there are some factors common among the examples, according to crypto’s legal advisers. The tokens’ developers or founders typically retained significant stakes, they designed the assets to appreciate over time, and they took actions in the hopes their coins would grab gains on secondary exchanges.  The Howey test  Expecting a profit is a key component of the so-called Howey test, which refers to a U.S. Supreme Court case that set the definition for what makes an investment contract. The SEC has often pointed to Howey as the standard by which it assesses whether cryptocurrencies are securities, though other laws could also be used.  Crypto lawyers tend to think the SEC is misinterpreting Howey – famously based on investments in an orange grove. The oranges themselves – which the attorneys equate with the digital assets – aren’t supposed to be securities, but the SEC incorrectly says they are, the lawyers contend.  “The SEC enforcement division is a big army of lawyers,” said Patrick Daugherty, who leads the digital asset practice at Foley & Lardner and who is set to teach crypto classes at Cornell University. “Even if you think they're wrong, you have to pay attention to what they do.”  He noted that Ripple has been fighting the SEC on this point, that XRP is not the unregistered security the agency contends. But Daugherty said Ripple has a war chest, which is needed for such a legal scuffle.  Despite his belief that today’s commission is overstepping the bounds of its legal authority, Daugherty said, “You have to be pretty rich to take that position when you're dealing with the SEC.”  The SEC’s nine are Flexa’s AMP, rally (RLY), the Rari governance token (RGT), derivaDAO (DDX), XYO, LCX, powerledger (POWR), DFX finance (DFX) and kromatika (KROM). In a statement shared with CoinDesk, a Flexa spokesperson said the company was “not contacted by the SEC” before the complaint and has “significant questions about the conclusions regarding AMP.”  By failing to directly accuse the issuers in an enforcement action, the regulator left them in limbo. Because an exchange where securities change hands needs to also register with the SEC, the platforms where those tokens trade have to ask themselves whether the agency is looking at them as unregistered exchanges.  Exchanges in the crosshairs  Coinbase may be the most prominent exchange to handle some of the tokens, but others traded on platforms, including KuCoin, Uniswap, DigiFinex and Bitget. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has already stated his belief that Coinbase needs to register.  ""The SEC is deeming nine tokens to be securities,"" Jaret Seiberg, a Washington-based analyst with Cowen wrote in a research note. ""That would suggest Coinbase and other platforms need to be registered as they are trading tokens that are securities.""  However, he continued, the SEC has let this happen for years without acting, and so that lack of enforcement could also be read as a ""tacit acceptance.""  And how will its reasoning about what makes a security play in court?  “I've analyzed a lot of different tokens,” said Joe Hall, a New York lawyer at Davis Polk who works with a number of major crypto firms. “There are usually arguments to be made on both sides” when deciding whether they may be considered securities, and he said that’s what the complaint against the former Coinbase manager is lacking – the “understanding of how they’ve weighed the contrary factors.”  Because the nine tokens were among many more that the SEC decided not to call securities in its insider-trading case, the agency may have dismissed some of those as outside of its jurisdiction – as it’s done openly with bitcoin, backed by a federal judge’s ruling in 2018 that the original cryptocurrencies are commodities.  Until the regulator explains why it didn’t name the other tokens as securities, it will be hard to nail down an understanding of the weight it gives each factor, Hall said.  “There's no broader analysis of all relevant facts and circumstances,” Hall said.  The SEC said it’s bringing on a flood of new lawyers, but not to write policy. Some 20 new enforcement lawyers were set to arrive to help the agency bring cases against crypto companies, which may further the SEC’s enforcement fences around crypto companies.  Meanwhile, several U.S. legislative efforts seem to be bent on shifting the balance of industry oversight into the authority of the SEC’s much smaller sister agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The SEC may have its territory scaled back by future laws, though the bills aren’t expected to clear Congress any time soon.  And the U.S. banking agencies are also moving to clarify their own reach into crypto – or at least the way their regulated lenders interact with the digital assets. The Federal Reserve offered more clarity this week about how bankers need to seek a sign-off from the regulator before doing anything with cryptocurrencies.  However, unless other U.S. financial agencies seize the sheriff’s badge – or have it thrust on them by Congress – the SEC remains the most influential authority.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/08/18/as-sec-leans-on-enforcement-to-regulate-crypto-lawyers-study-every-word,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9cbfcffaeb8d13eecba2cb7e250fb1f41ff94b62-1400x1050.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42421822,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwABB,1660848628,What Are Rollups? ZK Rollups and Optimistic Rollups Explained,"Blockchains, like Ethereum, can be slow and expensive. Having to spend $25 or more in gas fees for a single transaction is not ideal if you want to complete a decentralized finance (DeFi) trade.  That’s why layer 2 systems such as rollups have emerged. Rollups process transactions on another, faster blockchain (known as a layer 2), then port the transaction data back to the parent blockchain (the layer 1 or mainnet) at a fraction of the price. This means that users can benefit from the speed and cheapness of the rollup while also benefiting from the security of the bigger blockchain.  Rollups are one of several scaling systems, which are simply methods to make a slow blockchain faster and cheaper. Other scaling systems include sidechains and state channels.  Many scaling products relate specifically to Ethereum, the largest smart contract blockchain. The core Ethereum developers are trying to improve the blockchain’s speed and costs over the next few years through a series of updates. The first major integration, the much-talked about Merge, is expected to go live in September 2022. These upgrades will not necessarily diminish the importance of scaling solutions. Instead, scaling solutions are likely to complement the Ethereum upgrades.  Read More: What Is The Merge?  Two main types of rollups  There are two main types of rollups, Optimistic and Zero-Knowledge (ZK). The benefit of either is they cut down transaction costs considerably. The idea is that instead of waiting and paying for each transaction to process independently on Ethereum, dozens and dozens of transactions are recorded on the layer 2 chain, then “rolled up” into a single transaction that is then fed back to the more expensive, slower blockchain. By doing this, the cost of that one transaction is split across lots of users.  Optimistic rolllups  The first variety is called an Optimistic rollup. This is because it optimistically assumes that all the transactions contained within a rollup are valid. Optimistic rollups give everyone on the network a certain amount of time, usually a week, to contest fraudulent transactions. The benefit of the Optimistic rollup is that it’s quick; by assuming things are correct, the network doesn’t have to waste time confirming things. The drawback is that it usually takes about a week to officially withdraw your funds from popular networks like Optimism or Arbirtrum.  ZK-rollups  The second kind of rollup is a Zero-Knowledge rollup, also known as a ZK-rollup. These protocols use a complex piece of cryptography called a Zero-Knowledge proof to determine that a transaction is valid using only minimal information about that transaction. It’s privacy-preserving, sleek and, most important, fast and cheap. Compared with an Optimistic rollup, which requires funds to stay on the network until the dispute resolution period has closed, ZK-rollups allow users to withdraw their funds with less of a delay.  ZK-rollups hold a number of advantages over Optimistic rollups in terms of speed and security, but they are considerably more complex under the hood. So far, all of the ZK-rollups out in the wild have had specific applications, meaning they can only support a specific service or use case (like swapping non-fungible tokens or transferring crypto between addresses).  Thanks to recent advances in cryptography, teams from Polygon, Matter Labs and Scroll say they are close to launching the first zkEVMs – ZK-rollups that function identically to Ethereum’s mainnet. Like today’s popular Optimistic rollups, these newer ZK-rollups should be able to support virtually any application developers would care to build on Ethereum – making things vastly quicker and cheaper for end users.  Risks of rollups  Rollups, while they borrow Ethereum’s core security guarantees, still come with some risks relative to Ethereum’s mainnet.  For one thing, a rollup’s smart contracts can contain bugs – not unlike any other program built on Ethereum. While fail-safes and audits should help prevent exploits, relying on an external program to handle transactions will always carry some added risk.  Both types of rollups are also still in their infancy, and as such the networks on which they operate are often somewhat centralized. In some cases, the developing team behind a rollup maintains partial control over the network, and can theoretically pause or switch it off wherever they like.  Many rollups also continue to rely on centralized “sequencers” to efficiently coordinate transactions on the layer 2 chain. A sequencer can’t spoof or alter transactions, but it could technically censor or re-order them to extract some benefit for itself.  Rollups generally plan to decentralize in some form. Optimism began the transition to community governance earlier this year, and advances to rollup technology should ameliorate some of the issues around centralized network control.  See Also: Ethereum’s Rollups Aren’t All Built the Same  How to use rollups on Ethereum  Using rollups is easy. Both Optimistic and Zero-Knowledge rollups work pretty much the same way. The idea is that you bridge your funds to the layer 2 network and complete the transactions you want to do on the rollup, like buy and sell cryptocurrencies or NFTs, move funds between wallets or interact with DeFi protocols. Once the transaction is done, you can port your funds back to Ethereum. Here’s a brief guide on how that works.  First, you’ll need to fill your crypto wallet, such as a MetaMask, with ether (ETH) or ERC-20 tokens – tokens that are compliant with the Ethereum blockchain. Then you’ll have to switch your wallet to the layer 2 network. That’s the same process as with any DeFi protocol – just hit “connect wallet.” After you’ve connected your wallet to the layer 2, you’ll want to “bridge” your tokens – move them from one network to another.  There will be an Ethereum transaction fee you'll need to pay to bridge your funds to a rollup. Once your funds are on the rollup, you can trade as usual. Some networks, such as Optimism, charge you ETH for transaction fees, but they’re a lot cheaper than on Ethereum itself. Others, such as Loopring, charge barely any transaction fees at all.  Once you’ve completed whatever transactions you set out to accomplish, you can always bridge your funds back to Ethereum. That entails converting rollup funds back into ERC-20 tokens that are native to the Ethereum mainnet. The process is the same – head to the token bridge and withdraw your funds.

BlackRock’s new private trust will make bitcoin available to its institutional clients, tracking bitcoin’s performance, offering direct exposure to the price of the cryptocurrency and of course, trading options.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  “Despite the steep downturn in the digital asset market, we are still seeing substantial interest from some institutional clients in how to efficiently and cost-effectively access these assets using our technology and product capabilities,” BlackRock said in its press release.  The news comes shortly after the firm announced a partnership with Coinbase to provide clients of its Aladdin platform access to cryptocurrency trading and custody services. These developments highlight how traditional investors and institutions from banks to hedge funds are moving into the crypto market, indicating that digital assets are here for the long haul.  These fresh endorsements lend crypto ever-stronger legitimacy, bringing digital assets into the more traditional financial industry and therefore making them more accessible to both new and old investors.  But does advocacy from a multinational investment-management firm go against everything Bitcoin originally stood for? Especially when, just five years prior, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink called bitcoin an “index of money laundering.”  Bitcoin’s anarchic beginnings in 2009 heralded the potential democratization of finance. Blockchain technology promised a more open and secure approach to currency for everyone. So with bitcoin now trending in mainstream Wall Street investment portfolios, has the leading cryptocurrency betrayed its revolutionary roots?  See also: What Jack Dorsey's Beef With 'Web 3' Is Really About | David Z. Morris  At the end of June, Coinbase’s stock was at its all-time low of $47.02. But the announcement of BlackRock and Coinbase’s partnership may be partly responsible for the recent upward trajectory of the crypto exchange’s share price.  But Coinbase shares are still down 75% from their peak, and online skeptics feel BlackRock’s partnership with the once top-of-its-game Coinbase is nothing more than a power grab by a centralized financial institution.

42374038,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWvS5,1660841886,Is Filecoin Network's Incentive Plan Sustainable? Crypto Analysts Want to Know,"How long can it last?  That's what crypto analysts are wondering about the Filecoin incentive program, the driver behind the bulk of the blockchain project's growth.  Filecoin was launched in 2020 to decentralize the data storage business, providing an alternative to industry giants like Amazon Web Services at nearly a thousandth of the cost.  At its core, the network connects storage providers with clients looking to stow their data. By offering storage space – ranging from extra capacity on desktop computers to large racks – and then running mathematical proofs to show that clients’ data is unaltered, providers can earn the network’s native FIL token as a blockchain reward.  Recently, activity has been picked up the pace. According to a Messari report, active Filecoin storage deals between providers and clients surged 128% from the first quarter to the second quarter of 2022.  That has crypto analysts calling attention to the incentive program linked to 99.7% of that growth – Filecoin Plus (Fil+) – and wondering whether it's sustainable.  Under Fil+, storage providers can earn 10 times the block reward, or amount of FIL tokens, of a typical deal by working with “trustworthy clients” such as universities and research facilities. These clients apply to notaries, or community-elected trustees, to verify the data they are storing.  Fil+’s approval system weeds out storage providers who may negotiate deals with clients storing fake data just to reap block rewards.  Analysts say that Fil+ block rewards act as a subsidy for providers, making it feasible for them to slash storage fees (averaging $0.0000026 per gigabyte per year). Still, they wonder what might happen to Filecoin’s growth and activity once the incentive program tapers off.  “Over time, storage miners will have to start charging,” said Messari enterprise research analyst Sami Kassab. “What I think is going to be the most important thing to watch there is if the storage demand can still keep up when storing data is no longer free.”  New revenue streams  Filecoin project leaders say the network is set to roll out new functions to create additional revenue streams for data-storage providers, which would maintain growth and keep prices low even as the extra block rewards decrease.  Jonathan Victor, product lead for Protocol Labs, the open-source research and development lab that developed Filecoin, outlined five revenue sources for storage providers: block rewards, storage fees, retrieval fees, transaction fees and additional services.  Storage fees are what clients pay storage providers for the initial storage deal. Retrieval fees are what clients pay providers to fetch stored data. Transaction fees are what crypto brokers charge traders for buying and selling FIL.  While revenue from block rewards will eventually decrease, Victor argues that storage fees will remain low as long as providers can make up the lost revenue through retrieval fees, transaction fees and additional services.  According to Filecoin’s 2022 road map, the storage network plans to add a retrieval market during the third quarter that would increase the speed of blockchain data retrieval and allow storage providers to charge clients for retrieving the data they are storing.  Filecoin also launched the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) in July, which let clients run smart contracts from other networks and unlocked the potential for decentralized finance (DeFi).  In the fourth quarter of this year, Filecoin plans to implement a programmable storage market, which would allow clients to create customized smart contracts to meet their needs.  “Things like the FVM are going to drive transaction fees,” Victor said. “It will drive demand for Filecoin block space.”  FIL token price  Additional services that will generate revenue for storage providers include on-chain and off-chain computing functions, which Filecoin plans to add to allow clients to use their stored data for calculations. On-chain computing is done through smart contracts on the blockchain while off-chain computing temporarily takes data off of the blockchain.  One key question for digital-asset traders is what these changes all mean for the project's FIL token, which has more than doubled in price from a low point in June to a two-month high around $11.37 on Aug. 1.  The token is now trading at around $8.21, which is still about 96% down from its all-time high.  “What Protocol Labs’ main goal is, is to maintain and to increase block space demand,” Kassab said. “As long as you're doing that, then the FIL token continues to accrue value, which continues to incentivize the storage providers and all the other supply-side participants in the network.”",NEUTRAL,FIL,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIL | MARKET | RESEARCH,Jimmy He,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/08/18/is-filecoin-networks-incentive-plan-sustainable-crypto-analysts-want-to-know,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b60f006060d8eac2ce266698da56e375b89c4f77-3767x2825.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

On Twitter, Ethereum developer Lefteris Karapetsas asked Coinbase, Kraken and other centralized exchanges what they would do should the U.S. government demand that they comply with sanctions and block transactions related to blacklisted Ethereum addresses. The question has become a hot topic in the crypto community after last week's sanctioning of Tornado Cash, a crypto mixing service.  Centralized exchanges are among the biggest validators on Ethereum's proof-of-stake (PoS) chain, which is now in a testing mode but soon will become the main network as the platform's developers are planning to abandon the current proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism.  Karapetsas tweeted on Sunday:  ""If regulators ask you to censor at the #ethereum protocol level with your validators will you:  Three days later, Armstrong replied:  ""It's a hypothetical we hopefully won't actually face. But if we did we'd go with B i think. Got to focus on the bigger picture. There may be some better option (C) or a legal challenge as well that could help reach a better outcome.""  Armstrong also voiced support for Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev who was arrested in the Netherlands last week. The Coinbase CEO tweeted that ""no developer should be arrested for publishing open source software, even if that software is used by bad actors."".  But whatever he thinks about sanctioning open-source technology, ""hopefully obvious point: we will always follow the law,"" Armstrong said.  Read more: Tornado Cash Fallout: Can Ethereum Be Censored?  In proof-of-stake blockchains, validators lock up, or stake, their tokens in a smart contract as a guarantee they will behave honestly. For correct validation, they are rewarded with new tokens. If they fail to validate properly, their stake can be ""slashed"" by the protocol.  Some centralized exchanges, which already hold their users' tokens, also offer to stake clients' ETH for them within a larger staking pool for a share in the staking rewards. Coinbase, for one, will benefit greatly from its staking business after Ethereum switches to PoS, J.P. Morgan said.  However, recent efforts by governments to control even decentralized cryptocurrency projects and enforce sanctions, including the Dutch police's arrest of Pertsev, signal a potential hard choice for exchanges: to impose sanctions on the protocol level or forfeit their staking profits.  Eric Wall, chief investment officer at Arcane Assets, believes the community must force centralized exchanges to quit staking altogether, before it's too late.  ""Make Coinbase, Kraken, Bitcoin Suisse etc. understand that complying with OFAC is not an option. It will result in slashed stakes for all their customers and the end of their business. Make them unstake now if they don't plan to uphold censorship resistance,"" Wall tweeted, referring to the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control.",POSITIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/08/18/coinbase-ceo-suggests-exchange-wont-censor-transactions-on-pos-ethereum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0f6cd40a14561d28d125f3159852fd38004bf5e4-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Snook, the online multiplayer IO game, has developed a new solution to help more projects connect with their communities. The BBT-themed rooms are an exciting addition, and the venture has a strong lineup of initial partners. Snook Goes The Extra Mile Despite the popularity of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and GameFi, some industry inefficiencies still need to be addressed. For example, Snook acknowledges there is s degree of inflation that needs to be flattened sooner rather than later. In addition, the project has cracked the code to capture the value of skills and performance. That makes it different from the traditional buzz and speculation song and dance one would associate with NFTs. As a leading game on the Polygon blockchain, Snook has proven very successful since its launch. Measuring skilled work invested in the creation and development of NFTs is what brings out the true value of these non-fungible tokens. While artists deserve to make money, not everything they create will be valuable. It all comes down to applying oneself, getting better, and reaping the rewards from doing so. That different mindset enables the Snook team to tackle NFTs from a very different angle. The recent introduction of BTT-themed rooms illustrates that point rather well.

The link will allow Copper’s customers to connect with decentralized applications (dapps) and enables them to transact securely using the firm’s CopperConnect multi-party computation (MPC) technology, Copper said in a statement Thursday.  Decentralized finance (DeFi) is an umbrella term used for lending, trading and other financial activities carried out on a blockchain, without the use of traditional intermediaries. A dapp is an application that utilizes blockchain technology to keep users’ data out of the hands of the organizations behind it.  CopperConnect, which was introduced in November 2020, is a dedicated DeFi tool for Copper’s institutional clients to lend, borrow, stake and swap tokens. Access to Solana’s DeFi ecosystem is now live via CopperConnect, the company said.  “The launch of Copper’s digital asset custody provision will create a new avenue for users and institutional investors to access DeFi and digital assets,” Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko said.

42421113,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXZUPV,1660839304,CFTC Commissioner: Crypto Market Needs Clear Guidelines on Its Regulator,"Two bills in the U.S. Congress could set the direction for regulating the crypto industry in the coming months, said Kristin N. Johnson, a commissioner at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  Johnson, who was sworn in earlier this year, told CoinDesk TV on Wednesday the agency wants to give the crypto market clear guidance on which agency regulates it, and CFTC's regulatory role.  “It’s a question about oversight of the spot market,” Johnson said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover.” CFTC wants the authority to ""ensure market participants register and come into our ecosystem … and obtain for the customers they serve the protections that being part of the regulatory ecosystem means.""  Two bills in Congress would give CFTC that mandate. One is a bipartisan bill introduced by members of the Senate Agriculture Committee, which oversees the CFTC. It would give the agency “exclusive jurisdiction” to regulate cryptocurrency trades as defined by commodities laws.  The bill creates a definition of ""digital commodity"" that would include cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) but not anything that may be considered a security. Thus, the CFTC would have the ability to oversee both digital commodity transactions and force registration of digital commodity platforms.  The mandate under that bill gives the CFTC the green light to “actively and vigilantly” police the crypto markets, Johnson stated.  A separate and more wide-reaching bipartisan bill introduced by Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) also makes the CFTC the primary regulator for crypto spot markets and futures.  The bottom line, according to Commissioner Johnson, “is to get clarity around regulatory oversight.”  “It benefits market participants to know who their regulator is,” she added.  Johnson did not say whether the CFTC has the necessary resources to do that crypto industry regulation, but she did acknowledge any oversight will ultimately depend on “collaboration” with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Congress and state regulators.  Johnson added the U.S. is in a position to influence regulation on an international level. “The U.S. should be a leader in developing the regulatory policies that we will adopt [and] that would apply to markets globally,” she said.

42374029,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWvI1,1660838404,Helium Developer Nova Labs Buys FreedomFi to Accelerate Push Into Mobile Service,"Helium, the crypto-powered wireless network, has turned heads in the blockchain industry for building out a network of medium-range wireless hotspots fueled by cryptocurrency rewards that people might use as an alternative to hard-wired, centralized Internet service providers. The service has even been used to track crab pots.  Now, Nova Labs, the development company behind Helium, is pushing into the crucial, parallel realm of cellular networks.  On Thursday, Nova said it bought FreedomFi, a company which builds software for crowdsourced 5G networks, as part of Helium’s expansion into mobile communications.  In an interview, Nova CEO Amir Haleem declined to disclose the purchase price or comment on the terms of the acquisition.  “We had a desire to have more expertise in-house from FreedomFi and to be closer to accelerating what we are doing in 5G cellular,” Haleem said.  The Helium Network is a distributed network of long-range wireless hotspots, enabling anyone to own and operate a wireless network for low power Internet of Things (IoT) devices.  As part of the acquisition, FreedomFi team members will join Nova Labs. FreedomFi raised $9.5 million from semiconductor company Qualcomm and electronics corporation Samsung in March.  Helium 5G  FreedomFi is no stranger to the Helium ecosystem. In 2021 it was the first to introduce and receive approval for Helium 5G. Since then, the FreedomFi team has launched the world’s first Helium-compatible cellular base station, which allows consumers with zero knowledge of 5G technologies to set up a cellular network from their home and start mining the project's native HNT tokens.  The two entities started working together around 18 months ago, according Haleem.  FreedomFi co-founder and CEO Boris Renski said that joining with Nova opens the door for innovation that will have lasting impacts on the telecom industry.  “Using a crypto incentive model to crowdsource deployments of cellular networks has the promise of finally making community-driven mobile networks a reality, bringing affordable and ubiquitous connectivity to more people” said Joey Padden, chief technology officer and co-founder of FreedomFi.  The price for the HNT token, which is mined whenever the network is used, reached around $54 during the peak of the crypto bull market in 2021 but has struggled to pick up momentum since then (in line with the broader crypto market) and has tumbled to around $7.  When asked about the recent plummet in HNT's price, Haleem said, ""I like to use a longer horizon. When the token launched it was 1 cent. We are in a tough economic environment right now.""  Haleem said that Helium is still heavily focused on its IoT growth. He said about 30,000 hotspots are being added to the network every month across the world, down from 70,000 in early 2021.  “We are focusing on growing the usage side of the network as the coverage is looking good already,” Haleem said. “The IoT network is global. 5G is U.S. only at the moment, given network regulations in Europe.”",POSITIVE,HNT,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | HNT,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/08/18/helium-developer-nova-labs-buys-freedomfi-to-accelerate-push-into-mobile-service,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7a5673df322692cc6cd75c0b0d399e9e443e48c3-3038x2278.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Recoveries could be “between 50 to 60 cents on the dollar,” Braziel said Wednesday on CoinDesk's ""First Mover"" program.  In June, Celsius froze withdrawals, citing extreme market conditions, as it faced a liquidity crisis, and in July, it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the Southern District of New York.  During its first court hearing, Celsius proposed a restructuring plan focused on its mining operations and said it had a $1.2 billion hole in its balance sheet. It's not known yet whether mining bitcoin (BTC) can materially “increase or decrease recovery,” Braziel said .  If the price of bitcoin were to rise, it “could be a salvation to the estate,” Braziel said.  Still, it's unclear whether retail customers will be able to recover their funds, even as the lending platform tries to pay off its remaining decentralized- finance (DeFi) loans.  Braziel said while it’s a “high likelihood” that retail customers will “get something back,” questions of when that will happen have yet to be answered. He said that a typical bankruptcy proceeding could take six to 18 months.  Braziel, who bought claims from creditors during the bankruptcy of Tokyo-based hacked bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, said one difference between that situation and Celsius is the longer wait Mt. Gox creditors had to endure. Those creditors couldn’t sell their bitcoin but that ended up being to their benefit as bitcoin prices shot up astronomically during the bankruptcy proceedings.  “Forced 'hodl' can be a good thing,” Braziel said.

Follow CoinDesk Brasil on Twitter.  Mercado Libre (MELI), Latin America’s largest e-commerce company by market cap, started rolling out its own cryptocurrency in Brazil, the firm said Thursday.  The currency, Mercado coin, can be used to make purchases on Mercado Libre and receive it as cash back on purchases, the company said.  Mercado Libre expects the cryptocurrency to be available to its 80 million users in Brazil by the end of August, and said it plans to introduce it in other countries “soon,” without providing further details.  Mercado Coin will be tradable on Mercado Pago, the company's digital wallet, at an initial price of 10 cents, which will be subject to market conditions, the company said.  Mercado Libre will operate its cryptocurrency in partnership with the crypto company Ripio, which will provide custody and trading services on Mercado Pago.  The cryptocurrency was developed using the ERC-20 token standard on the Ethereum blockchain, the company said. During the first stage, users will not be able to transfer it to external wallets.  “The blockchain technology behind Mercado coin allowed us to develop an open and extremely secure solution,” Guilherme Cohn, senior manager of corporate development, said in a statement. “We continue to follow the evolution of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, as we believe in the potential of these tools.”  In December, Mercado Libre launched a crypto trading feature in Brazil, which reached 1 million users two months later. The company has plans to launch the same product across Latin America.  This article was translated by Andrés Engler, and edited by CoinDesk. The original Portuguese can be found here.

42421820,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwADF,1660832069,What Is Web3?,"Web3 – also known as “Web3″ or “Web 3.0″ – is a term you may of heard thrown around a lot lately. It simply refers to the next iteration of the internet that promotes decentralized protocols and aims to reduce dependency on large tech companies like Youtube, Netflix and Amazon. But what is it, and why is it on everyone’s minds?  Quick Takes  Web3, the next stage of the internet, promotes decentralization and individual user empowerment, reducing reliance on tech behemoths such as YouTube, Netflix, and Amazon.  Unlike previous versions of the internet, Web3 allows individuals to have more control over their data and content, moving away from the ""walled gardens"" created by large tech companies.  Cryptocurrencies serve as the native payment system in Web3, enabling decentralized peer-to-peer transactions. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) offer a way to establish ownership and trade unique digital assets, aligning with Web3's focus on user control and decentralization.  Criticisms of Web3 include unequal ownership over blockchain networks, ""decentralization theater,"" and high barriers to entry for creating blockchains, which are viewed as tasks for highly specialized engineers.  What is Web3 and how is it different from Web1 and Web2?  To understand Web3, it makes sense to understand what came before. The first version of the Internet – known as Web1 – arrived in the late 1990s and comprised a collection of links and homepages. Websites weren’t particularly interactive. You couldn’t do much apart from read things and publish basic content for others to read.  Brian Brooks, the CEO of Bitfury, put it smartly in a speech to the U.S. Congress in December 2021: “If people remember their original AOL account, it was an ability to look in a curated ‘walled garden’ at a set of content that was not interactive, but was presented to you on AOL, the way that Time Magazine used to show you the articles they wanted you to see inside of their magazine, just you could see it on a screen.”  Web2 came next. Some people call this the “read/write” version of the internet, in reference to a computer code that lets you both open and edit files rather than just view them. This version of the Internet allowed people to not only consume content, but create their own and publish it on blogs like Tumblr, Internet forums and marketplaces like Craigslist. Later, the emergence of social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram took content sharing to new heights.  After a while, the general public became cognizant about the way their personal data was being harvested by tech giants and used to create tailored advertisements and marketing campaigns. Facebook, in particular, has had the spotlight shone on it innumerable times for breaching data privacy laws and was hit with a $5 billion fine in 2019 – the largest penalty ever issued by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC.)  Although Web2 has brought the world amazing free services, a lot of people have grown tired of the new “walled gardens” these huge tech companies have created and want to have more control over their data and content. This is where Web3 comes in.  Web3 can be understood as the “read/write/own” phase of the Internet. Rather than just using free tech platforms in exchange for our data, users can participate in the governance and operation of the protocols themselves. This means people can become participants and shareholders, not just customers or products.  In Web3, these shares are called tokens or cryptocurrencies, and they represent ownership of decentralized networks known as blockchains. If you hold enough of these tokens, you have a say over the network. Holders of governance tokens can spend their assets to vote on the future of, say, a decentralized lending protocol.  Again, here’s Brooks: “The real message here is that what happens on the decentralized internet is decided by the investors versus what happens on the main internet is decided by Twitter, Facebook, Google and a small number of other companies.”  What can you do on Web3?  Web3 makes the proliferation of cooperative governance structures for once-centralized products possible. Anything at all can be tokenized, whether it’s a meme, a piece of art, a person’s social media output or tickets to Gary Vee’s conferences.  A great example of the paradigm shift is in the gaming industry. Gamers grumble endlessly about the bugs that developers leave in their favorite video game, or how the latest patch has upset the balance of their favorite weapon. With Web3, gamers can invest in the game itself and vote on how things should be run. Large Web2 companies, like Meta and Ubisoft, are creating virtual worlds powered in part by Web3. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) will also play a huge role in reshaping the gaming industry by allowing players to become the immutable owners of the items they accrue.  How is Web3 related to cryptocurrency?  Cryptocurrencies are a key component of the Web3 ecosystem.  One of the core ideas of Web3 as laid out by the Ethereum Foundation is that “Web3 has native payments: it uses cryptocurrency for spending and sending money online instead of relying on the outdated infrastructure of banks and payment processors.”  Web3 has native payments: it uses cryptocurrency for spending and sending money online instead of relying on the outdated infrastructure of banks and payment processors.  Within Web3, the idea of ownership of assets is key, and cryptocurrencies not only serve as a medium of exchange, but also allow for a “token economy,” where users can earn cryptocurrencies for contributing to a platform, arguably fostering a more equitable internet. Cryptocurrencies provide the financial infrastructure and incentive mechanisms that underpin Web3.  Finally, cryptocurrencies provide a direct, trustless method of payments and exchange and remove the third party control that Web3 strives to eliminate.  Read More: What Are Web3 Cryptos?  How is Web3 related to NFTs?  Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are another key component of Web3. NFTs are unique digital assets that are stored on a blockchain. Unlike crypto, every NFT has a distinct value and contains specific information that makes it unique.  NFTs enable the ownership and exchange of digital goods, such as digital art, music and even virtual real estate. NFTs provide a way to prove ownership and authenticity of digital content, which was not possible in the Web2 model. By allowing creators to tokenize their work, NFTs are democratizing the digital economy, arguably giving economic power back to creators and users, which aligns with the principles of Web3. Finally, NFTs can also allow players of games to own their in-game items such as outfits, weapons and other cosmetics, which they can then trade directly with other players without third-party intervention.  Read More: What Are NFTs and How Do They Work?  Web3 and the metaverse  The metaverse refers to a collective virtual shared space, which may or may not have Web3 elements. People often refer to games like Roblox or Minecraft as Web2 metaverses. What separates the Web3 version of these virtual worlds is the inclusion of NFTs and blockchain as an essential part of the world.  The inherent decentralization of Web3 enables a metaverse where users have true ownership over virtual assets, identities and data. These virtual assets, often taking the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), can be bought, sold or traded on a blockchain directly.  Read More: A Crypto Guide to the Metaverse  Criticisms of Web3  The main criticism of Web3 technology is that it falls short of its ideals. Ownership over blockchain networks is not equally distributed but concentrated in the hands of early adopters and venture capitalists. A public spat recently erupted on Twitter between Block Inc. CEO Jack Dorsey’ and various venture capitalists over Web3, bringing this debate to the forefront.  At the heart of the critiques is the idea of “decentralization theater,” where blockchain projects are decentralized in name but not in substance. Private blockchains, VC-backed investments, or decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols where just a few people hold the keys to hundreds of millions of dollars are all examples of decentralization theater.  And despite the supposedly leaderless community of protocols, there are clear figureheads. Izabella Kaminska, the outgoing editor of the FT blog Alphaville, pointed to the huge amount of power that Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, continues to have over the network, even though he’s no longer involved in its development:  “Vitalik is a funny and contradictory phenomenon in his own right. He operates as the spiritual leader of a de facto headless system, while holding incredible sway and influence over the headless system he created and oversees,” Kaminska told The Crypto Syllabus.  Things aren’t much better within decentralized finance protocols. They’re rife with voter absenteeism, often rely on centralized infrastructure and the barrier to entry in creating them is still high, given that creating blockchains seems to be arcane magic reserved for only the most highly specialized engineers.  But despite its problems, Web3 has a lot of potential. Whether it’s too idealistic to put into practice will be something that everyday users will discover over the next decade.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Robert Stevens,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-is-web-3-and-why-is-everyone-talking-about-it,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4b6eaca9c6dd7c4016f978737f7a927ca4d054c5-2869x2152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374042,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWvYN,1660829926,First Mover Americas: Fifth Day of Declining Bitcoin Price Has Some Traders Looking Out Below,"Price Point: Bitcoin was lower for a fifth straight day, dashing hopes that the largest cryptocurrency might soar past $25,000. Some traders are starting to worry about a move below $22,000.  Market Moves: A bullish trendline on bitcoin’s price chart has been breached on the downside, potentially a result of the Federal Reserve’s hawkish meeting minutes released Wednesday.  Chart of The Day: A key indicator in the bitcoin options market known as “skew” shows renewed demand for puts, or contracts offering protection from price drops.  This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Price point  Bitcoin (BTC) was trading relatively flat on the day, down 1%, in the fifth straight day of losses for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Ether (ETH) was also down.  BTC was recently trading at $23,500. It has lost momentum since it reached $25,000 on Monday. Traders are speculating that a move below $22,000 might suggest the rally has run its course for now.  ETH is moving in a similar direction, down 2% on the week and struggling to remain above $1,800 after hitting a high of about $2,000 earlier in the week.  Privacy token monero (XRM) was one of the only gainers in altcoins on Thursday, trading up 4% over the last 24 hours. Cosmos (ATOM) was up 3%.  Coinbase suspicious trading  In traditional markets, stock futures edged up as investors awaited economic data, including jobless claims, home-sales figures and major corporate earnings reports.  In the news, a new study found that insider trading was a bigger issue than previously thought at cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, suggesting market regulators seeking to police trading may have more work ahead of them.  The paper found suspicious trading in 10% to 25% of new crypto listings and said the problem goes beyond the instances in a U.S. Department of Justice case brought in July.  According to J.P. Morgan analyst Kenneth Worthington, Coinbase is in a position to benefit from the Ethereum Merge as institutional and retail customers get value from staking ether.  In Latin America, Colombia is considering a central bank digital currency (CBDC) to facilitate transactions and reduce tax evasion. As part of a tax reform program, the South American country also plans to impose limits on cash transactions.  And blockchain Solana’s biggest decentralized-finance (DeFi) lender is leaning into “permissionless” loan markets.

The cryptocurrency fell more than 2% on Wednesday, dropping below a bullish trendline drawn from July 15 and July 26 lows. The breakdown sparked concerns on social media of a deeper sell-off.  The Fed minutes released late Wednesday showed policymakers discussed the need to continue raising interest rates to keep borrowing costs at levels that restrict U.S. economic growth for long enough to tame inflation. The cryptocurrency is sensitive to changes in Fed policy and has halved since the central bank kicked off its tightening cycle in March.  The push for continued rate hikes and restrictive policy contradicts recent market pricing, which had indicated expectations of interest-rate cuts in 2023 and lifted bitcoin to a two-month high of $25,203. The surprise may also inject volatility into markets.  ""It seems reasonable that increasing and elevated rates are headwinds for bitcoin,"" said Lewis Harland, a researcher at Decentral Park Capital. ""The Fed appears to keep consistent in their inflation North Star and the cost seems like an economic contraction.""  According to Michael Kramer, founder of Mott Capital Management, traders of Fed fund futures no longer see the central bank switching to rate cuts next year. Traders expect rates to peak at about 3.7% by March and remain there until late 2023. Last month, the central bank raised the benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points (0.75 percentage point), lifting it to the 2.25%-2.5% range.  Read the full story here.  Chart of the Day  Bitcoin Skew Shows Renewed Demand for Puts  By Omkar Godbole  The one-month put-call skew, which measures the cost of puts (bearish bets) relative to calls (bullish bets) expiring in four weeks, is rising again, indicating renewed demand for puts.  Positive values indicate puts are pricier than calls, a sign of investors seeking downside protection.  The one-month skew turned neutral early this month after rising as high as 35% in June.

42374041,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWvX7,1660829400,Buzz Over Potential Ethereum Hard Fork Token Fizzles as Price Tanks,"Earlier this month, some cryptocurrency exchanges rushed to list ETHPOW, the token of a potential, duplicate Ethereum protocol, betting that crypto traders would want to speculate on the token's price even before its launch.  After more than a week of trading, their expectations have fizzled as crypto traders’ appetite have faded.  Data shows that daily trading volume dropped 66% to $4 million from $13 million after the first trading week. Meanwhile, ETHPOW’s price fell to $50 from as high as $140, according to cryptocurrency price tracker CoinMarketCap. Trading data on Poloniex and BitMEX, two exchanges that listed the token, also show low trading interest and falling prices.  ETHPOW’s declining fortunes underscore the unpredictability of forks and illustrate how fickle investor interest can be. The precedent may also discourage other crypto exchanges from listing the token too hastily.  The Merge  The Ethereum blockchain is gearing up for its highly anticipated upgrade to proof-of-stake technology known as ""the Merge,"" which would make ETH miners obsolete.  To counter that, Chandler Guo, a prominent crypto miner and investor, proposed crafting a duplicate of the Ethereum blockchain via a hard fork that would keep proof-of-work mining. When the fork occurs, every ether owner should receive the same number of ETHPOW tokens as their ETH holdings.  Read more: Who Will Mine Ethereum After It's Gone?  BitMEX analysts said earlier this month that ETHPOW “may generate a lot of excitement” and forecasted that ETH/ETHPOW “will be a popular trading pair post-split.”  Yet other than exchange listings and the support of Tron founder Justin Sun, the protocol has yet to build much momentum. Information about what applications ETHPOW would support or how it would generate users has been scarce.  “Pertinent details on its core functioning are few and far between,” Walter Teng, a crypto analyst at Fundstrat, told CoinDesk. “Will stablecoin providers fully or partially back coins on ETHPOW? Will decentralized finance protocol contributors maintain product development on ETHPOW, or will they require others to step in? Will non-fungible token (NFT) projects recognize IP (internet protocol) addresses in the fork?  “These are key questions in determining the value of the PoW fork after the Merge, yet they remain unanswered,"" he said.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING | FORKS,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/08/18/ethpow-buzz-fizzles-as-would-be-tokens-price-tanks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ec62b7678efd74a8ac2958d5b3e2c91422886df9-4680x3510.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

DAOs are blockchain-based governance bodies that have no central authority. Typically, members holding the organization's native crypto token have the power to vote on key decisions.  The proposed regulations are part of the Catawba Digital Economic Zone's (CDEZ) effort to attract blockchain and Web3 companies to the federally recognized 700-acre reservation. In July, the CDEZ passed a set of regulations defining digital assets. The zone closely followed Wyoming's efforts in setting up its own rules for DAOs, it said at the time.  Last year, Wyoming became the first U.S. state to pass legislation allowing DAOs to be recognized as limited liability companies (LLC). Drawing inspiration from Wyoming, the CDEZ seeks to allow DAOs to organize as LLCs. But the draft rules also add an alternative.  ""The draft regulation provides a 'menu' option for DAOs to be regulated as two different entity types: Limited Liability Companies (LLCs) or Unincorporated Non-Profit Associations (UNAs),"" the CDEZ said in a press release shared with CoinDesk.  The option to organize DAOs as non-profits provides the flexibility that the governance bodies ""crave,"" according to the CDEZ. It means a DAO would be free to govern itself almost entirely through its own principles rather than any statutory requirements.  ""These can be verbal, written or even software based rules. Unlike LLCs, UNAs do not require a registered agent. Yet, they are still protected by limited liability. And while the original UNA is mostly for non-profit purposes, the regulation leverages the UNA law's existing exemptions to allow UNA DAOs to provide compensation, including through staking,"" the CDEZ said.

Beginning Thursday, the firm will support staking MATIC on the Polygon network and will roll out support for ETH, AUDIO, SOL and DOT over the next few months.  Gemini’s announcement comes as other crypto firms expand their staking offerings ahead of the Ethereum blockchain’s much-anticipated Merge, which will shift the protocol from proof-or-work to a faster, more energy-efficient proof-of-stake model. After years of delay, The Merge is now scheduled to occur on Sept. 15.  Gemini Vice President of Product Layla Amjadi said investor interest driven by the Merge was integral in the firm’s decision to introduce its staking services.  “It's now more clear than ever that people are interested in staking, especially now that we're on the cusp of the Ethereum Merge,” Amjadi told CoinDesk. “With Ethereum being a staking option for them on Gemini soon and after the Merge, and with there being more liquidity and higher yields, staking is becoming more and more appealing for people.”  Read More: Winklevoss-Led Gemini Cuts 10% of Staff, Citing ‘Turbulent’ Crypto Market  Gemini’s support services will allow users to stake and unstake any amount of crypto without any fees, Amjadi said. The firm will cover infrastructure costs and gas fees associated with staking and unstaking, and will offer slashing protection and other reimbursement opportunities for penalties incurred during the staking process.  Support for the service will be available in the U.S., except for New York, where local laws prohibit staking, as well as in Singapore and Hong Kong.  Gemini’s expansion is part of a wider push by large crypto exchanges to create opportunities for retail and institutional investors to collect staking rewards. Coinbase (COIN), Binance, Kraken and Crypto.com have all launched staking services of some kind, with Coinbase Prime announcing this month that it would add Ethereum to its growing list of staking options for U.S. domestic institutional clients ahead of the Merge.

42411390,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNXYy,1660827000,Ethereum’s Merge Will Increase Its Use Cases and Drive Its Investment Narrative,"The most widely used blockchain, Ethereum, is set to undergo a major upgrade to its protocol, from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, sometime next month.  The upgrade will bring significant changes to the Ethereum network and potentially change the investment outlook for the popular blockchain.  For that reason, advisors should be prepared to educate their clients on the transition. This includes first educating them on what Ethereum is – including some of the basic plumbing behind the network – and then on how the transition could affect their current crypto holdings.  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.  What is Ethereum?  As the largest cryptocurrency behind bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) has a current market cap of over $180 billion.  Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain powered by its native currency, ether. Ethereum is responsible for the creation of smart contracts, which power many of the most most important crypto initiatives, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), decentralized apps (dapps) and non-fungible tokens (NFT).  Ethereum is currently powered and secured by a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which incentives network participants to solve arbitrary mathematical puzzles. Under the current PoW system, Ethereum miners earn 2 ETH per block mined, which occurs approximately every 10-19 seconds.  What will the merge do?  The Ethereum Merge will shift the Ethereum security mechanism from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake (PoS) and greatly impact the tokenomics of the blockchain.  Proof-of-stake is a consensus mechanism (currently being used by many protocols such as Cardano), which is powered by users staking their coins in exchange for the ability to validate new transactions on the network. Once the requirements of the network are met by validators, a new block is created and participants are awarded native tokens for their assistance in securing the network.  Under the new PoS mechanism, Ethereum will be secured by validators instead of miners. These validators will create blocks when chosen by the blockchain and confirmed by others, in turn helping secure the network. When a new block is added to the network, rewards will be distributed in ETH in proportion to each validator’s stake.  Read more: What Is the Ethereum Merge?  Although it will require significant technical knowledge to run an Ethereum validator, it will be made accessible to many investors through staking in a pool or with the assistance of a third party. The network will require a validator to stake 32 ETH in order to participate in the validation mechanism.  Ethereum will be secured by validators “staking” their ether. While it only takes 32 ETH in order to be a network validator, the more ETH that is staked, the greater the chance of being selected by the network. When a validator is selected by the network, that staker will earn a reward generated through transaction fees.  The transaction fees paid to validators are the “gas fees” that users pay in order to transact on the blockchain. Part of the PoS transition will introduce sharding – a technical upgrade that splits the Ethereum network into different pieces in order to increase transaction speed and reduce network fees. The introduction of sharding is expected to lower costs and increase transaction speed.  How the merge will affect supply  Investors have long believed that the 21 million BTC supply cap of bitcoin is one of the strongest features of the most popular cryptocurrency, unlike any fiat currency in existence. Investors have often referred to bitcoin as “digital gold” and have allocated capital to bitcoin based on its tokenomics and supply transparency.  Ethereum is currently unlike bitcoin in this aspect. The current ether inflation rate has been steadily increasing since the launch of the project, a topic that many crypto enthusiasts have often pointed out as a negative feature of Ethereum.  Ethereum has historically had a much higher inflation rate than Bitcoin and no theoretical cap on total supply. With the planned upgrade, the fundamentals of Ethereum are likely to change.  The Ethereum upgrade will likely decrease the total ETH supply and provide token holders with an opportunity to stake their tokens. Because of the expected yield generated through staking, it is likely that the total market interest in Ethereum will increase as an investor can participate in income generation for holding their ETH.  A decrease in the total supply of ETH will likely be seen as a positive change to the second largest cryptocurrency.  Christine Kim, research analyst at Galaxy Digital said, “Supply should contract rather than expand over time. And so I think that’s a huge boost to Ethereum’s investment narrative as a store of value and as a hedge against inflation.”  Increased participation  In order to successfully mine on a PoW blockchain, an individual has to make a significant capital allocation. Running a PoW mining operation is cost intensive, often requiring the purchase of hardware, power-supply upgrades, and logistical solutions.  The transition from PoW to PoS will reduce the capital barrier needed to secure Ethereum, allowing many new market participants to stake their ETH and help secure the network.  The current cost to run an Ethereum node is approximately $36,000 USD (per current prices), allowing retail investors to pool their ether and profit from staking.  Read more: How a Post-Merge Ethereum Could Attract Institutional Investment  How the merge will affect energy efficiency  The Ethereum merge will increase the efficiency of the Ethereum network.  The PoS upgrade will dramatically decrease the energy requirements of the Ethereum blockchain and therefore the overall consumption by the network.  Those wishing to secure the network will no longer be required to run expensive and energy inefficient mining hardware and will instead be able to run a validator node.  Although PoW blockchains are highly secure from a network perspective, the PoW consensus mechanism requires miners to use tremendous amounts of energy. The amount of electricity required to secure the Bitcoin blockchain has a comparable carbon footprint to many small nation-states, according to ConsenSys, a blockchain software company founded by Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin.  Many environmentally friendly investors have spoken out against the energy consumption of PoW blockchains. With ESG investing growing in popularity, many investors are simply not allowed to invest into projects that have a negative effect on the environment or climate. PoS blockchains are significantly more efficient and require a small fraction of the energy used to secure PoW blockchains. The merge will allow an investment into ether to be seen more favorably by those investing with strict environmental requirements.  Many investors, including large institutional investment firms such as endowments, family offices, and pension funds, are extremely interested in cryptocurrency investments. They are governed by environmentally conscious investment standards (ESG) and have expressed concern with the energy requirements of PoW networks. While PoW networks are secure, the Ethereum upgrade to PoS will likely satisfy the strict ESG requirement and allow new entrants into the market.  Use case benefits of the merge  The Merge will have many significant implications on the crypto market. Ethereum’s transition from PoW to PoS will prove that a decentralized and permissionless network can operate in an energy-efficient manner. Successful transition to PoW will likely cause a renewed interest in Web3 projects aiming to build on top of the Ethereum network.  Looking at the macro picture of crypto markets, we are currently seeing tremendous interest in Web3. Non-fungible tokens (NFT), decentralized finance (DeFi) and decentralized apps (dapps) are growing significantly, despite the overall bear market in crypto prices. Venture investment into Web3 has been accelerating, with many developers continuing to enter the blockchain space.  There are two main concerns stalling Web3’s development: (1) energy-efficient blockchains that are secure and decentralized enough to build upon and (2) recruiting talent and developers to the space to help build these ambitious projects.  In other words, the current Ethereum blockchain is unable to handle additional high-volume projects due to the high transaction fees and environmental concerns the current PoW mechanism limits.  The Ethereum upgrade will likely address these concerns in a way PoW networks have been unable to, allowing many Web3 companies to build their projects on an incredibly efficient and secure network. The increased efficiency of the network will provide a solid and efficient foundation to build upon.  Read more: Reminder: The Merge Won’t Solve Ethereum’s Scaling Woes by Itself  The merge will improve nearly all metrics of the Ethereum blockchain, paving the way for future innovation of applications and experimentation. Ethereum’s smart-contract capabilities have been used to create thousands of dapps, have attracted millions of users, and have generated billions of dollars for investors and users.  Because of the capabilities of Ethereum, we have seen the creation of many significant projects including:  Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO)  Decentralized finance (DeFi)  Initial coin offerings (ICO)  Security token offerings (STO)  Non-fungible tokens (NFT)  Stablecoins  How investors can prepare  Ethereum’s transition to a PoS mechanism will increase diversification of Ethereum, change its tokenomics and decrease its energy requirements.  When comparing the tokenomics of ether to those of bitcoin, it is important to note that the Ethereum upgrade is still not entirely confirmed. The upgrade has been planned for years and further delays are certainly possible.  Investors need to understand that this upgrade is incredibly complex and it is likely to be delayed and there are possible issues that may arise. Announcements of further delays could not only negatively affect the price of ether but could affect bitcoin and other cryptos as well.  Bitcoin, by comparison, is incredibly transparent and is the most secure blockchain in existence. Investors preferring less volatility ahead of the upgrade may find Bitcoin a safer bet.  Whether or not investors stand to benefit by positioning themselves in ETH ahead of the upgrade will depend on a variety of factors, especially the overall market climate. Advisors should be prepared to educate investors on these risks.  Read more: Crypto Derivatives Traders Bet on Ether Staking Yields Doubling to 8% Post-Merge  However, assuming a successful upgrade on Ethereum, investors will need to look at an investment into Ethereum through a different lens than they have historically, as many features will have changed significantly.  Ethereum is currently the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, behind only bitcoin, and is currently the biggest and most established smart-contract enabled cryptocurrency. Ethereum has many competitor blockchains, such as Solana and Cardano. These programmable smart contract networks have already adopted the PoS mechanism and are aiming to attract new users, many of whom have migrated away from Ethereum.  The Merge will position Ethereum in direct competition with these other layer 1 networks while also allowing for a robust layer 2, or companion, ecosystem to be built on top of the network. While the upgrade has been delayed multiple times, successful implementation will ensure that Ethereum remains the leading smart-contract network and position it for future growth.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET,Jackson Wood,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/08/18/ethereums-merge-will-increase-its-use-cases-and-drive-its-investment-narrative,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/60e639c61660494c1d1a59b9da72dff9681b27e6-2133x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374031,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWvGl,1660823504,Bitcoin Loses Bullish Trendline as Fed Sees Restrictive Rates Needed for Some Time,"Bitcoin (BTC) lost a key price support after the minutes of the Federal Reserve's July meeting dashed hopes that looser monetary policy is set to return to the U.S. next year.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value fell by more than 2% on Wednesday, dropping below a bullish trendline drawn from July 15 and July 26 lows. The breakdown sparked concerns of a deeper sell-off on social media.  Fed minutes released late Wednesday showed policymakers discussed the need to continue raising interest rates to keep borrowing costs at levels that restrict U.S. economic growth for long enough to tame inflation. The cryptocurrency is sensitive to changes in Fed policy and has halved in value since the central bank kicked off its tightening cycle in March.  The push for continued rate hikes and restrictive policy contradicts recent market pricing, which had indicated expectations of interest rate cuts in 2023 and lifted bitcoin to a two-month high of $25,203. The surprise may also inject volatility into markets.  ""It seems reasonable that increasing and elevated rates are headwinds for bitcoin,"" said Lewis Harland, a researcher at Decentral Park Capital. ""The Fed appears to keep consistent in their inflation north star and the cost seems like an economic contraction.""  Traders of Fed fund futures no longer see the central bank switching to rate cuts next year, according to Mott Capital Management's Michael Kramer. Traders expect rates to peak around 3.7% by March and remain there until late 2023. Last month, the central bank raised the benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points (0.75 percentage point), lifting it to the 2.25%-2.5% range.  While the tightening may end next year, as traders predict, the timing of renewed liquidity easing is unclear. That could cap the upside in risk assets.  ""The liquidity contraction is still underway. The Fed's remarks in the minutes of its July meeting indicated that the liquidity contraction may end in 2023, but the timing of the re-addition of liquidity is unknown,"" Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader from crypto asset management firm Blofin, said.  ""The Fed rate hike in September and the uncertainty about by the [Ethereum] Merge [stemming from the possibility of a blockchain split] will further suppress investors' bullish expectations,"" Ardern said.  Some observers, including former Fed trader Joseph Wang, read the minutes as somewhat less hawkish because the transcript revealed concerns about overdoing tightening to contain inflation. The also said policymakers judged it would be appropriate to slow rate hikes at some point. It remains to be seen if markets agree with Wang's assessment and reverse Wednesday's losses.  Bitcoin traded near $23,500 at press time, indicating a slight recovery from Wednesday's low of $23,180. However, the cryptocurrency remains well below the former-support-turned-resistance level of the rising trendline.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | FORKS,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/08/18/bitcoin-loses-bullish-trendline-as-fed-sees-restrictive-rates-needed-for-some-time,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/df49eaa2d6fd9a947f27564450f4d1a055d39a6c-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Korea Financial Intelligence Unit (KoFIU), part of South Korea's Financial Services Commission (FSC), said the firms had advertised crypto and offered services to Koreans without obtaining the requisite registration.  The firms it said were conducting ""illegal business activities"" are KuCoin, MEXC, Phemex, XT.com, Bitrue, ZB.com, Bitglobal, CoinW, CoinEX, AAX, ZoomEX, Poloniex, BTCEX, BTCC, DigiFinex and Pionex.  The country's registration requirement for crypto firms took effect in September with the enactment of the Financial Transaction Reports Act. Efforts to crack down on the industry have intensified following May's fall of Terraform Labs, founded by Korean native Do Kwon. Prosecutors have raided seven exchanges since Terra's collapse. Earlier this month, the FSC said it will help expedite new rules to rein in the crypto industry.  The KoFIU has notified authorities the 16 firms allegedly violated their ""registration duties"" and that it plans to alert financial authorities in the countries where the companies are based. Violation of the registration requirements carry a maximum sentence of five years in prison or a fine of up to 50 million South Korean won (US$38,000). The firms will also not be allowed to register as a virtual asset service provider (VASP) in the country for an unspecified period of time.  ""The KoFIU has requested the Korea Communications Commission and the Korea Communications Standards Commission to block domestic access to the websites of unregistered VASPs to prevent the use of virtual asset services provided by unregistered entities,"" the statement said.  Credit card transfers and transfers of crypto assets to and from the unregistered firms will be blocked ""to disable their use in domestic market.""

On Thursday, Beijing-based Canaan reported that its revenue in the second quarter rose 53% from the year-earlier period to 1,653 million yuan ($247 million) and that earnings were 53 cents per American depositary share. That was 3.53 yuan per ADS, up from 1.46 yuan per ADS a year ago.  In the earnings press release, CEO Nangeng Zhang described the quarter as a ""challenging period"" because bitcoin's price tumbled below $20,000 in June and China locked down some cities due to COVID-19. The lower bitcoin price ""will bring prolonged headwinds to our performance in the coming quarters,"" Zhang added.  Bitcoin miners' margins were slashed following a market crash that pulled the world's largest cryptocurrency below $20,000 in early June. Miners have also been faced with soaring energy prices in recent months, brought to a head by the war in Ukraine.  Computing power sold fell to 5.5 million terahashes per second from 5.9 million TH/s. Canaan responded by dropping prices on spot sales, which it said will lead to a dramatic decrease in gross margin during the second half of the year.  ""Looking forward to the coming quarters, we see a tougher market environment from the lower bitcoin price level, overall increased energy price and various pandemic and geopolitical uncertainties globally, which may all jeopardize the demand and price for our products,"" Chief Financial Officer James Jin Cheng said in the press release.  Canaan's Nasdaq-listed shares rose 4.6% to $4.09 in premarket trading on Thursday.

The event followed the positive report on CPI (Consumer Price Index) given by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in July. This announcement became the major push on the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum. The CPI as of July dropped lower than the anticipated 8.5%, according to past reports. However, this doesn&apos;t seem to contribute positively to potential inflation. To this effect, experts are now expressing concern about what they consider sticky inflation. The Managing Principal at Enduring Investments LLC, Michael Ashton, has revealed what he thought to be the reason for the reduced CPI. According to Ashton, the significant factors that contributed to the reduced CPI were flexible items. He stated that some examples of such flexible items are apparel and airfare.

It is trading as low as 89 cents against the USDC stablecoin on decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Curve Finance. The so-called depeg occurred 16 days after crypto exchange FTX removed HUSD from its basket of support USD stablecoins.  A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency designed to hold its value against another asset. This can be in the form of algorithmic stablecoins or reserve-backed coins, of which HUSD is an example. The stablecoin sector has been under intense regulatory scrutiny this year following the implosion of algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD (UST), which saw $18.71 billion evaporate alongside the collapse of Terra's LUNA token.  A year ago, HUSD published a breakdown of reserves that showed every issued token was backed by U.S. dollars held in cash in money market accounts. At press time HUSD has a market cap of $149.5 million.  HUSD is issued by Stable Universal and can be redeemed on a 1:1 basis against the U.S. dollar, according to the company's website.  Typically, when redemptions are live the price will gravitate toward the peg because if it's lower, traders can purchase tokens at a discount on an exchange and redeem for a full dollar through the company's website.

Key Technical Points: The Polkadot price has dropped by 13% in the last week. The price actions show a bearish breakout of a rising wedge pattern. With a market cap of $9.377 billion, the intraday trading volume of Polkadot has increased by 16% to reach $459 million. Past Performance of DOT As we mentioned in our previous analysis, the DOT prices retest the $8.75 mark, but the downtrend continues instead of a bullish reversal. Currently, resting at the 50-day EMA, the prices sustain above $8, avoiding a drop to the $6.55 support level. Moreover, the higher price rejection in the daily candles retests the broken resistance trendline. Source - Tradingview DOT Technical Analysis The DOT price action reflects an increase in the underlying bearishness as the selling pressure increases, evident by the spike in trading volume. Hence the possibility of a 50-day EMA breakout increases to test the bottom support at $6.55. After the recent sideways shift into EMAs, the downfall restarts the bearish influence over the EMA.

Should you consider an early bullish entry? Key Technical Points: The Ethereum Classic price has increased 22% in the last two weeks. The bull run inchoates a flag pattern in the daily chart. With a market cap of $5.584 billion, the intraday trading volume of Ethereum Classic has increased by 54% to reach $1.324 billion. Past Performance of ETC As we mentioned in our previous analysis, the ETC prices displayed a successful post-retest reversal from the $33 mark to reach overhead resistance of $45. However, the bullish rally reverses from the $45 mark to retest the $38 breakout resulting in the formation of a rising wedge. Furthermore, the increasing wedge forms a bullish flag pattern with an 80% bull run in July 2022. Source - Tradingview ETC Technical Analysis The ETC price action forms a morning star pattern in the daily chart as prices take a reversal from the support trendline. Hence a short-term buying opportunity arises as the trend may shortly reach the $45 mark close to the resistance trendline. After the recent Golden Crossover, the bullish influence over the 100-day EMA increases, projecting a crossover possibility with the 200-day EMA.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Bitcoin and Ether Fall Again  By James Rubin  What happened to the rally?  Bitcoin and ether dropped for a fourth straight day as investors continued to puzzle over recent, often opposing economic indicators and corporate earnings reports. On Wednesday, markets wrestled with U.S. Federal Reserve's minutes from last month's meeting of its Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which in central bankers' typically obtuse language indicated that the Fed would continue raising interest rates but seemed open to downward adjustments in the near future.  Cryptos already bleeding red initially responded with a big shrug.  BTC was recently trading at about $23,400, down about 2.5% over the past 24 hours and well off the $25,000 level it reached on Sunday for the first time since late spring. ETH was recently trading hands at about $1,850, off roughly 2.8% over the same period after topping $2,000 multiple times over the past week.  The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been soaring in recent weeks amid hot anticipation of the Merge, which will shift the Ethereum blockchain from proof-of-work to the faster, more energy efficient proof-of-stake protocol. Other cryptos were largely in the red. AAVE was down more than 8% at one point, and the popular meme coins, DOGE and SHIB, which had surged over the past few days, were each off more than 5%.  ""In the last 24 hours, we've had a little bit of a pullback,"" Joe Orsini, director of research at Eaglebrook Advisors, told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program. ""When you consider the move that's been made with bitcoin up around 30% from June 18 lows, ether up about 115%, profit taking without FOMO, and some traders kind of taking some off the table makes sense. It doesn't change the long-term story [of] $25,000; regaining that level should provide some psychological positivity around the market.""  Orsini added: ""Things under the surface in the macro situation, have started to feel like they are improving. I wouldn't take too much into the short-term price action. We've had a great bounce. And let's see what could happen over this quarter.  Equities  Stocks also slogged through a dreary day with the technology-focused Nasdaq tumbling 1.2% and the S&P 500, which has a strong tech component, and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) declining 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively. Equity markets that have roared back to life amid faint hopes that the Federal Reserve's recent monetary hawkishness was subduing inflation without casting the economy into steep recession have lost momentum this week as investors chewed on the latest economic signs.  U.S. retail sales ticked up slightly in July, a reflection of falling gas prices that encouraged consumers to continue shopping despite ongoing inflation. The retail figure also suggests that even if the economy is slowing, it remains strong. Gas has fallen to $4 a gallon from $5 over the last month, a 20% decline.  Crypto news  The crypto industry continues to struggle with misleading and sometimes inaccurate information. Late Wednesday, the native token for Ethereum layer 2 blockchain Optimism briefly crashed in price on after Twitter-based rumors spread that its multisignature wallet had been hacked.  Optimism’s core team insisted there was no hack. Still, the OP token fell 10% in a matter of minutes at 5:15 p.m. ET, according to data from CoinMarketCap, before rebounding. On messaging platform Discord, the team clarified that the fund movements were preplanned Coinbase Custody-related transfers to investor wallets. The value of the funds transferred is around $450 million, according to Etherscan data. The token subsequently rebounded.  Other crypto news was mixed. Earlier in the day, a Ukraine senior official tweeted details of weapon purchases the government has made with some of the $60 million in crypto donated after Russia invaded the European nation earlier this year.  But a new academic study found that insider trading was a bigger issue than previously thought at cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (COIN), suggesting market regulators seeking to police trading may have more work ahead of them. A giant like Coinbase listing a token can give cachet and dramatically boost liquidity for a token, causing its price to rise. Someone could – illegally – profit from that by purchasing a cryptocurrency before its listing is made public.  Eaglebrook's Orsini was upbeat about crypto's potential pricing, given institutional investors' growing interest in the asset. ""The technology continued to move uninterrupted throughout all of the problems block by block day by day, and that should be the consideration for true long-term investors again, three to five plus years out,"" he said.

Recent reports state that Celsius could run out of cash as early as October, which has dented recovery hopes among investors who stored their funds on the platform. A Tuesday filing, submitted to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York in advance of an upcoming hearing, also stated that the crypto lender holds $2.8 billion less in crypto than it owes to depositors.  The crypto lender filed for bankruptcy in July and said at the time it was working on recovery plans to make its users whole.  Against this backdrop, market participants would logically expect the company’s poor fundamentals should have led to a steep drop in CEL prices. Instead, the reverse has happened: CEL’s value has nearly doubled in the past 30 days and surged as much as 50% in the past week before a sell-off following Tuesday’s filing.  A short squeeze?  Still, there’s no, apparent strong reason for growth, analysts say. Pawel Laskarzewski, co-CEO of blockchain bridge platform Synapse Network, told CoinDesk that CEL tokens previously gained value in July after rumors of blockchain network Ripple and institutional bank Goldman Sachs (GS) wanting to buy Celsius gained traction among crypto participants.  “This led to huge speculation on the token and the token price increase as this built some confidence that the company will eventually survive,” Laskarzewski explained.  But Laskarzewski added that recent price movements were likely driven by a short squeeze. “The biggest factor that influenced the price in the last weeks was a short squeeze. Traders on FTX alone closed some 300,000 short positions in just two days between Aug 11 and 13,” Laskarzewski said. “Usually, short squeezes cause big corrections as they are not organic trades but panic ones – and we can see one right now – from $4.60 to $3.10.”  A short squeeze is a financial market term used to describe an asset’s prices moving sharply higher as market volatility prompts highly leveraged traders who bet its price would fall to buy that asset to avoid greater losses. This scenario leads to a price increase caused more by market activity than the asset’s fundamentals.  Dean Peng, vice president at crypto asset manager Metalpha, also stated that the price’s dislocations were likely caused by market dynamics rather than fundamentals.  “The contract price for late September settlement is at $2.60, which is more than 20% lower than the spot price earlier this week,” Pang said. “At the same time, the price of the perpetual contract is also lower than the spot price, and the negative rate has remained for some time.”  “It seems the market is retaining its negative judgment on Celsius' fundamentals,” the crypto trader added.

According to a report from the Financial Times, the fund is the second-largest in Canada and has signaled the write-off as being indicative of the funds&apos; expeditious decision to have exposure to crypto assets. Canadian Fund&apos;s &apos;Disappointment&apos; Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, or CDPQ, is Canada&apos;s second-largest pension fund in the country, according to the Times, managing over $300B in funds in Quebec. The fund&apos;s stake in Celsius was written off &apos;out of prudence,&apos; according to the report, signaling that the fund has no expectation of Celsius Network achieving any semblance of a recovery. The move comes less than a year after the fund described it&apos;s investment into Celsius as being indicative of it&apos;s &apos;conviction&apos; in blockchain technology, and serves as another unfortunate domino in the Celsius downfall. Chief executive of the fund, Charles Emond, said that the fund &apos;went in too soon into a sector that was in transition, with a business that had to manage extremely quick growth.&apos; While the fund outperformed benchmarks, it still recorded a loss of nearly 8% in the six months ending in June.
