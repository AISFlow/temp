13169062,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=536546,1686008473,Bitcoin Weekly Momentum Crosses Bearish For First Time In 2023,"In a significant development this week, Bitcoin price has crossed bearish on the weekly LMACD (Logarithmic Moving Average Convergence Divergence), marking the first time this has occurred in 2023. Does this mean further decline for BTCUSD, or do bulls still have a chance to save the recent uptrend? Bitcoin Momentum Takes A Turn For The Bears Last night, the weekly candle in BTCUSD opened with a bearish crossover of the LMACD. Today, we saw a key support level fail at $27,000, prompting the cryptocurrency’s value tumble to $25,000. This bearish crossover and selloff interestingly coincides with an announcement from the SEC about enforcement action against the cryptocurrency giant, Binance. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) A Security? Price Collapses On SEC v. Binance Lawsuit The SEC claims that Binance allegedly provided trading of unregistered securities to US traders. The list of securities included several top altcoins. The timing of the legal action, technical indicator crossover, and selloff, gives weight to Sir John Templeton’s axiom, “show me the chart and I’ll tell you the news.” In other words, major news events often appear to be reflected in price movements and can be predicted by watching chart patterns. There is a bearish cross on the weekly LMACD | BTCUSD on TradingView.com Why The Crossover Might Not Crater Crypto However, while the crypto market may be responding to immediate news, it’s essential to interpret these developments within a broader context. If momentum continues to descend from the zero line, we may witness a resumption of the prior bearish trend, which could pose challenges for Bitcoin investors. Nevertheless, as seasoned traders will recall, the last time Bitcoin experienced a similar momentum downturn from this level on the LMACD was just before the 2020 bull run. Despite the initial bearish crossover, the downtrend proved to be short-lived, paving the way for significant upward price appreciation. Related Reading: Why This Is The Most Important Bitcoin Chart You’ll See This Week Looking at historical precedent, it’s possible that the current bearish turn may not be as dire as it initially seems. However, investors and traders should continue monitoring BTCSD weekly LMACD along with other technical indicators and major news events, maintaining a balanced and comprehensive perspective of the market.

42410495,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdXBCj,1686005679,Apple's New Headset Could Change the Way We Design the Metaverse,"Apple on Monday announced its new Vision Pro mixed reality headset, tossing its hat into the already-saturated arena of immersive digital technology. Taking on heavy-hitting competitors like Microsoft's Hololens, Meta's Oculus and Magic Leap, Apple has pegged its device as ""a revolutionary spatial computer that seamlessly blends digital content with the physical world, while allowing users to stay present and connected to others.""  The sleek device, an expansion of Apple's existing hardware lineup, is controlled by a user's eyes, hands and voice inputs. Most impressively, Apple says that the device will ""interact with digital content in a way that feels like it is physically present in their space,"" meaning its high-resolution device can seamlessly project content into a user's physical space.  ""Vision Pro is years ahead and unlike anything created before – with a revolutionary new input system and thousands of groundbreaking innovations,"" said Apple CEO Tim Cook in a press release. ""It unlocks incredible experiences for our users and exciting new opportunities for our developers.”  The device carries some impressive specs: it boasts 23 million pixels across two displays, features a custom Apple silicon chip and introduces VisionOS, a spatial operating system that offers a three-dimensional interface, releasing applications from the boundaries of traditional screens and bringing them into real-world spaces. To start, Apple says that users can play over 100 Apple Arcade games, though the Silicon Valley giant says that the device ""makes new types of games possible with titles that can span a spectrum of immersion.""  Additionally, the device includes what Apple has dubbed ""EyeSight,"" which allows the user to see other people while also displaying the user’s eyes, taking away the creepiness that often comes with wearing a headset.  While some purists may say that the product borrows ideas from existing devices, its upcoming release is meaningful for the development of our immersive digital future. Not only is the Apple App Store one of the most lucrative platforms for developers, Apple also has an expansive and passionate customer base, recently announcing that it has surpassed two billion active devices.  Apple explicitly avoided the use of words like ""augmented reality"" or ""metaverse"" in its marketing materials, though it's clear that this technology represents a new paradigm for immersive digital experiences and will likely shape the way we build in Web3.  Designing the Blueprint for a digital future  Previous discussions about the metaverse have been vague, maybe intentionally so, and typically centered on the idea of a single immersive, digital space where users can converge. The term, originally coined in 1992 by science-fiction author Neal Stephenson, has been co-opted by brands and virtual world-building platforms to point to their version of this concept, though data suggests that none of these versions have yet to stick.  As my colleague Cam Thompson wrote in April, the execution of the metaverse so far has been ""multiple spaces, centralized or decentralized, where users can access multiple different metaverse experiences, each siloed away from the other without interoperability.""  Many blockchain-native companies and funds are still invested in its development and continue to make meaningful progress, though it appears that the path forward for the conceptual metaverse remains paved with potholes, as evidenced by Web3 giant Animoca Brands recently scaling back its metaverse funding target.  Apple's entry into virtual tech may signal a meaningful shift for an otherwise stagnant space. It is among the largest tech companies in the world, though historically it has been quiet when it comes to discussions about blockchain technology or the future of Web3. While its App Store supports some blockchain games,it has simultaneously signaled a rejection of Web3 by refusing to exempt NFTs from its 30% “Apple Tax” on in-app purchases.  Cook has previously expressed skepticism over the concept of the metaverse – or at least the amorphous way in which the metaverse has thus far been described.  ""I always think it’s important that people understand what something is,” Cook told Dutch publication Bright in September 2022 when rumors first began to swirl that Apple was eyeing virtual reality. “And I’m really not sure the average person can tell you what the metaverse is.”  Cook has previously dismissed immersive digital and virtual technology as something that can be used for short periods but ""is not a way to communicate properly.""  ""I don't think you want to live your whole life that way,"" he told Bright, though he has been more bullish on the idea of augmented reality (AR), calling it ""a profound technology that will affect everything.""  Without using the word, the Vision Pro is Apple's decisive statement on the future of the metaverse. By creating the technological framework, Apple has set the bar for what immersive digital experiences can – and should – look like, opening the door for developers within and outside of the Web3 space to create products that fit within its realm.  ""Apple's Vision Pro shows that the future of the Internet is 3D,"" said Kenneth Landau, CEO and co-founder of cloud-based metaverse platform Mytaverse. ""Tim Cook cemented this theory when he compared Vision Pro to the next wave of computing, following the Mac and iPhone.""  ""It builds upon theories built by the metaverse industry over the past few years,"" added Mytaverse co-founder and CTO Jaime Lopez.  For example, at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday, the company introduced its take on digital personas, a concept central to Web3. The device uses machine learning and the front sensors on the device to create a natural-looking and dynamic digital avatar that mimics a user's facial and hand movements.  The Disney connection  In addition to rolling out its new device, the company announced a partnership with The Walt Disney Company, allowing users to interact with Disney sports, shows and movies in a newly-immersive way.  ""This platform will allow us to bring Disney to our fans in ways that were previously impossible,"" said Disney CEO Bob Iger during the WWDC presentation.  The integration of Disney media onto Apple's new device is likely a continuation of its metaverse strategy that it first began touting in mid-2022. At the time, Disney announced it had picked blockchain Polygon and brought on executives to lead its foray into immersive virtual experiences. They followed this with a push to ramp up resources for Web3 efforts via a job posting for a specialized in-house counsel for NFTs and decentralized finance (DeFi).  But Disney appeared to put a nail into its plans in March, reportedly laying off 7,000 staff members, including those on its metaverse team.  Disney's renewed interest in virtual technology may signal a reopening of that chapter, albeit alongside Apple's resources. It further legitimizes the emerging technology and shows the depth of its possible use cases for billions of Disney fans around the world.  Mainstream appeal?  While the Vision Pro certainly has the potential to transform our future digital landscape, experts say the device in its current state is not meant for mainstream consumption, limiting the scope of its impact, at least initially, to early adopters willing to pay the $3,500 price tag.  “They know this is an evolution that’s going to take some time,” Jeff Fieldhack, a research director at Counterpoint Research, told The New York Times.  But experts also acknowledge that this is a major technological leap forward that will impact many industries to come. It's not yet clear if the new device will inspire Web3 developers to create new wearables with similar functions or if Apple will eventually allow Web3 platforms and applications into its expansive, multi-dimensional ecosystem, though it has certainly laid the groundwork.  Cathy Hackl, chief metaverse officer at Journey, believes the Vision Pro ""will take entertainment and communications to the next level.""  Hackl, who previously worked at both Oculus and Magic Leap, told CoinDesk, ""This is the most advanced tech product ever created.""  ""It’s a supercomputer. This device is a stepping stone toward a future AR device that Apple will continue to work on.""",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY | AR,Rosie Perper,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/06/05/apples-new-headset-could-change-the-way-we-design-the-metaverse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/27e4471e595a7f1a9ae0eeca7efd81ed68df720c-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Top of the list, the regulator said, was that Binance allegedly allowed the trading of several crypto assets, including BNB, the platform’s native currency; Cardano’s ADA; and MATIC, the token priming the Polygon ecosystem. XRP Not A Security? The SEC didn’t mention payment company Ripple, the native currency of the XRP Ledger, a platform through which the company bases its flagship products. The two entities have been entangled in a legal fight since late 2020, when the regulator accused the payment company of allegedly selling an unregistered security, XRP. It should be noted that despite the regulator mentioning XRP, the coin’s price is lower and weighed by the market-wide collapse that has so far wiped billions in value from the total crypto market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap (CMC), a coin tracker. Related Reading: Ethereum Top 10 Whales Now Hold 31.8M ETH, A New All-Time High When writing on June 5, the total cryptocurrency market cap had contracted by over 5% to $1.09 trillion. During this time, the XRP price has been down 7% in the past 24 hours. However, comparing the current performance to how XRP faired last week, the coin is the only one in the green territory, adding 3%. This means XRP has outperformed all the top-10 cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum and Bitcoin. The failure of the SEC to mention XRP in their lawsuit could be a huge boost for the token and its ecosystem in the days and weeks ahead. This is especially considering the ongoing case. Ripple Supporters Remain Bullish Despite SEC’s Accusations The case is ongoing, but there have been rulings in recent weeks that make XRP supporters optimistic. The presiding judge has denied SEC’s motion to seal the Hinman documents. Although the SEC vehemently campaigned for these documents to remain private, claiming they were deliberative and privileged, the judge said the public had the right to know since they are relevant to the case. These documents are critical in the case as they detail internal communication by the SEC on how they classified XRP as a security. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) A Security? Price Collapses On SEC v.

42410484,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdXAZ3,1685999831,"Optimism 'Bedrock' Upgrade to Speed Confirmations, Cut Gas Fees, Set Path to 'Superchain'","Optimism, a layer 2 to the Ethereum blockchain, is set to implement on Tuesday its “Bedrock” upgrade, designed to improve the usability of the chain by lowering gas fees and cutting deposit-confirmation times by 90%.  The goal for Optimism is that the network will move a step closer toward its ambition of becoming a “Superchain” of many interoperable and composable blockchains. The big U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase announced plans earlier this year to build its new Base network using Optimism, and the crypto-friendly venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) is backing a new client software for the project.  “Bedrock was named Bedrock for a reason,” Karl Floersch, CEO and co-founder of OP Labs, which supports development on Optimism, told CoinDesk. “It is the foundation for the Superchain.”  The Superchain would constitute a network of chains all built with Optimism’s OP Stack. The Superchain will combine these mini-chains together so that they are able to communicate amongst each other in one environment.  “The Superchain is the long-term vision, which is essentially many OP chains, which all work together using the OP Stack standard,” Floersch said.  Bedrock aims to lower gas fees by 40% by implementing “an optimized data compression strategy,” and will introduce support for reorgs, which is when a blockchain produces two blocks at the same time and it temporarily creates a duplicate blockchain. The code change in Bedrock will mitigate reorgs by reducing confirmations for deposits to 1 minute from 10 minutes.  Bedrock aims to lower gas fees by 40% by implementing “an optimized data compression strategy,” and introduces mechanisms that will mitigate reorgs, which is when a blockchain produces two blocks at the same time and it temporarily creates a duplicate blockchain. The code change will reduce confirmations for deposits to 1 minute from 10 minutes.  The upgrade, sometimes technically referred to as a hard fork, will also improve proof modularity for its OP Stack, which is an open-source toolkit for developers so they can build in customizable environments on Optimism, as well as introduce other code changes that will improve node performance. Improvements to proof modularity means that after the upgrade, validity proofs and fault proofs can both be used with the OP Stack.  In addition, Bedrock will help move Optimism to a multi-client ecosystem, meaning there would be at least two versions of software used to interact with the network; according to Floersch, Optimism is the first layer 2 protocol to have multiple clients – seen as bolstering the system’s resilience by eliminating single points of failure.  Client software is used to run the blockchain, and layer 1 blockchains like Ethereum rely on multiple clients to help maintain the security of the network. (If there’s a bug in one client, then the chain can rely on other clients to keep the blockchain running.)  The upgrade is expected to take place at 16:00 UTC on Tuesday and should last two to four hours. Deposits and withdrawals will be unavailable during the period, and the chain will halt temporarily.  Read more: Optimism, Scaling Solution for Ethereum, Sets June Date for Biggest Ever Upgrade, ‘Bedrock’  What is Optimism?  Optimism is a scaling solution for Ethereum, where users are able to transact for cheaper on the blockchain while inheriting the underlying security of Ethereum.  Optimism uses a type of technology that is called an “optimistic rollup,” which “rolls up” a bunch of transactions into a single transaction. This then increases the speed of the transaction and lowers gas fees, and then is posted back to the underlying, more expensive blockchain.  Optimistic rollups assume that all transactions that go through are valid, and give the network a certain amount of time (usually a week) to dispute transactions that are spoofed with.  The layer 2 landscape on top of Ethereum has seen some intense competition over the past few months. According to L2Beat, Arbitrum, another optimistic scaling solution and Optimism’s biggest rival, leads the way with $5.69 billion total value locked (TVL), a measure of collateral socked into decentralized-finance (DeFi) protocols on the network, while Optimism has $1.68 billion TVL.  Bedrock is supposed to make Optimism more competitive with Arbitrum.  ZK Rollups – an alternative to optimistic rollups – have also gained momentum, giving users more choice on how they might transact for faster and cheaper on top of Ethereum. Polygon and Matter Labs both came out with their zkEVMs, which is a type of ZK Rollup that is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine.  “This is a big deal for OP mainnet,” said Floersch.

The SEC action led to large declines across the board for crypto markets on Monday, including Coinbase, which closed the session down about 9.1% to $58.71.  In March, Coinbase itself received a warning from the SEC that it may soon receive enforcement action tied to its listing of potential unregistered securities. ""We estimate that at least 37% of COIN's net revenue would be at risk if the SEC were to target the company's crypto token trading and staking operations,"" noted Palmer, who continued with a hold rating and $55 price target on the stock.  Coinbase currently has 11 buy ratings, 7 holds and 6 sell ratings, according to FactSet data.  ""We believe investors should be focusing on whether COIN would have the ability to successfully pivot its business model and geographic focus if it were forced to curtail or cease a large portion of its business activities in the U.S. as a result of an SEC enforcement action,"" wrote Palmer.

13166416,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=536535,1685998806,Crypto Clash: Bitcoin Bulls And Bears Wrestle For Control At Key Support Level,"Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies have taken a hit in the wake of recent news regarding Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. The market has reacted with concern to the disclosure of a complaint against the exchange, which has sparked a wider downtrend throughout the cryptocurrency industry. As of this writing, Bitcoin has declined by over 5% in response to the news, trading at $25,700. This drop in value mirrors the current market sentiment as investors grapple with the implications of the complaint against Binance. Related Reading: Cardano Founder Urges ADA Investors to Beware of New Scams The Bitcoin MA Standoff According to the analysis firm Material Indicators, their popular Fire Charts tool shows approximately $6.3 million in bid support defending the 200-week moving average (MA) placed at $25,200 for Bitcoin. If the bid support can maintain its strength and consolidate above this level, it would be a bullish sign for Bitcoin’s prospects. However, Material Indicators notes they are not confident that the 200-week MA will hold without additional bid support. The 200-week MA is crucial for Bitcoin, representing a long-term trend line historically supporting the cryptocurrency. A breach of this level could signal further downside for Bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency market. Furthermore, Market analyst Maartun has reported $650 million of Bitcoin open interest flushed from the market, resulting in a 5% price decline. Open interest is the total number of outstanding contracts not settled in the Bitcoin futures market. These contracts represent positions taken by traders who are betting on the future price of Bitcoin. The $650 million of open interest flushed from the market suggests that traders were caught off guard by the sudden decline in Bitcoin’s price, highlighting the ongoing volatility of the cryptocurrency market. However, the market will likely remain volatile in the short term as investors continue to digest the news surrounding Bitcoin and the wider regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies. It remains to be seen how this will impact the industry in the long term, but for now, investors are bracing themselves for further turbulence in the cryptocurrency industry. Crucial Moment For The Crypto Market The total market capitalization of the cryptocurrency market has been volatile in recent months, experiencing significant ups and downs as the market reacts to various news and events. However, many analysts remain bullish on the market’s long-term prospects, citing increasing adoption and institutional interest as factors that could drive prices higher in the future. However, according to trader and analyst Michael Van De Poppe, the total market capitalization of the cryptocurrency market is currently undergoing a test of its 200-week moving average and exponential moving average (EMA). This is a significant technical indicator that traders and analysts closely watch as it provides insight into the market’s long-term trend. Van De Poppe explains that if the market can hold above the 200-week MA and EMA, it could signal the current correction’s end and a new bullish trend. On the other hand, if the market fails to hold above the 200-week MA and EMA, it could indicate a continuation of the bear market. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) A Security? Price Collapses On SEC v.

42410486,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdXAff,1685996864,Binance Lawsuit Could Be ‘Huge Mistake’ or Bring Needed Clarity to U.S. Crypto Industry,"The Securities and Exchanges Commission’s (SEC) suit against the biggest crypto exchange in the world, Binance, could be a huge misstep if other countries allow the crypto industry to develop and it eventually replaces the traditional banking sector, Jim Bianco, president and founder of Bianco Research said.  “If crypto is the design of the next financial system, this [lawsuit] is a huge mistake,” Bianco told CoinDesk via email, saying that the enforcement action against Binance is another attempt by U.S. lawmakers to “drive crypto out of the [country].”  On Monday, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Changpeng Zhao’s crypto exchange on allegations that it has been offering unregistered securities and staking services to the general public, violating U.S. securities laws.  This comes after the Commission sued Justin Sun and three of his companies earlier this year for the unregistered offer and sale of crypto asset securities, similar to the action it brought against Binance.  Read more: Binance Withdrawal On Track to Be Largest Since March Crypto Banking Crisis  “This meaningful action from the SEC signals the beginning of a shift in the U.S. towards regulated market infrastructure for crypto, which ultimately should help the industry move forward,” said Aaron Kaplan, co-CEO and co-founder of Prometheum Inc, the parent company of SEC and FINRA-registered digital asset securities trading platform Prometheum ATS and SEC-qualified custodian Prometheum Ember Capital.  “The competitive landscape will look quite different, but I anticipate it will result in a net benefit for U.S. investors and should allow innovation to thrive,” Kaplan added.  In a statement to CoinDesk, a Binance spokesperson confirmed that the exchange had received a Wells Notice, a warning from the SEC, earlier this year that ultimately led to a suit. U.S.-based exchange Coinbase also received a warning in March that it may face an enforcement action due to its listing of potential unregistered securities.  While Coinbase is still committed to the U.S., this led to the exchange doubling down on its operations elsewhere, including Canada and Seychelles. Coinbase (COIN) shares dropped 10% on Monday following news of the Binance lawsuit.  “Ongoing lack of regulatory clarity is creating a situation in which digital asset ventures are leaving the United States for friendlier jurisdictions, potentially depriving the U.S. of jobs and innovation at home,” said Richard Mico, the U.S. CEO and Chief Legal Officer of Banxa, a payment-and-compliance infrastructure provider.  While the action against Binance signals a further crackdown on the industry, some experts welcomed the SEC’s suit.  Read More: Coinbase Shares Drop 10% Following SEC’s Suit Against Binance  “The SEC's legal action against Binance in the United States seems not only warranted but also somewhat overdue,” said Steve Rosenblum, founder of Libertify.com, a risk management platform, said. “Binance has attracted criticism for its perceived lack of operational transparency. High-ranking executives within the company seem to be largely inaccessible, further contributing to this concern.”  Similarly, Valerii Brizhatiuk, co-founder of Swisstronik, an identity-based L1, said that “players such as Binance have a wide range of features, products and investing services. Sometimes directing these products and services to support the global user base, but still adhere to the U.S. regulation, could pose a challenge.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/05/binance-lawsuit-could-be-huge-mistake-or-bring-needed-clarity-to-us-crypto-industry,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/84f7fb3d1f88c5c7abba6894e4fd7809b062b254-3914x2017.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

13165443,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=536506,1685995243,Bitcoin Ordinals Releases Upgrade to Address ‘Cursed Inscriptions’ Problem,"The Bitcoin Ordinals protocol developers have introduced a new upgrade to rectify over 71,000 invalid inscriptions previously untradeable. These inscriptions often result from incorrect usage and were rendered useless and untradeable until now. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Poised For Significant Breakout: Here’s What To Watch Out For However, with this recent development, developers have taken the first step toward addressing this long-standing problem. Developers Unleased the New Ordinals Protocol Version 0.6.0 Bitcoin Ordinals refer to nonfungible asset artifacts that allow data to be inscribed onto the smallest unit of Bitcoin, known as a satoshi. According to Dune Analytics, $45.5 million have been generated from 10.8 million ordinal inscriptions since the beginning of this year. On June 4, a notable developer, Raphjaph, announced that Ordinals’ latest version, 0.6.0 is available. He added that this development would mark a turning point in recognizing these previously unrecognized inscriptions enabling them to be traded once again. Essentially, “Cursed Inscriptions” was coined to describe inscriptions generated through improper usage or manipulation of opcodes during the creation. As a result of these processes, the inscriptions became invalid and unacknowledged by the system. Ordinals creator Casey Roadarmor first proposed to fix the issue in late April by recognizing and converting these cursed inscriptions to “Blessed” ones. Related Reading: Ethereum Top 10 Whales Now Hold 31.8M ETH, A New All-Time High Roadarmor desired to modify the ordinals protocol to recognize multiple inscriptions per transaction, inscriptions with unrecognized even headers, etc. As such, the enhancements in the latest version optimize the “ord” system, streamline inscriptions, and ensure client agreement, enhancing efficiency, flexibility, and compatibility. Meanwhile, Ordinals promoter LeonidasNFT said that the “cursed inscriptions,” as recognized by the Ordinal’s latest version, act as a “stepping stone,” offering a pathway for previously invalid inscriptions to become visible. Ordinals Spark Controversy and Record Transaction Costs Since the inception of the Bitcoin Ordinals protocol in January 2023 by Casey Rodarmor, there have been multiple speculations concerning its transaction costs and slower speeds. One of the most significant concerns raised by the community is the undeniable and undesired impact of Ordinals on Bitcoin’s network capacity and scalability. There has been a sharp increase in BTC transaction fees caused by the surge in BRC-20 activity which relies heavily on Ordinal inscriptions. The trading frenzy surrounding BRC-20 meme-coins like Pepe (PEPE) pushed transaction costs to their highest levels since 2021. The blockchain has been experiencing massive congestion as users continue to pour BTC into minting new tokens settled via Ordinals inscriptions. On May 7, the congestion reached a critical point when Binance halted BTC withdrawals temporarily due to approximately 400,000 pending transactions congesting the mempool. Balancing the innovation brought by Ordinals with the need for a scalable Bitcoin network poses a challenge that must be addressed to ensure the continued success of the cryptocurrency.

The relevant indicator here is the “entity-adjusted UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD),” which, in simple terms, tells us about how the cost basis of the investors is distributed right now. The cost basis here refers to the price at which they bought their coins, so this distribution shows us at which price how many coins were acquired by the holders. Note that this indicator has been adjusted for entities, meaning that all internal movements between the wallets owned by a single investor are removed from this data (an “entity” refers to a collection of addresses that Glassnode has identified to belong to the same holder). Naturally, this adjustment has been made because any movement between the addresses of the same entity would otherwise count as a sale. Thus, a fresh cost basis would be given to the investor (when in reality, it wouldn’t be so). Related Reading: Bloomberg’s Senior Macro Strategist Predicts More Pain Ahead For Bitcoin Now, here is a chart that shows what the URPD in the Bitcoin market looks like right now: Looks like the levels around the current price have a large amount of coins concentrated | Source: Glassnode on Twitter As highlighted in the above graph, the levels around the current spot price of the cryptocurrency seem to be the largest center of cost basis in the market right now. In total, 780,000 tokens were purchased at these prices, which amount to around 4.6% of the entire circulating supply of the cryptocurrency. Because of this reason, the current price range that Bitcoin is trading in might be crucial for where the asset could go from here. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Topside Bias Vulnerable If It Continues To Struggle Below $28K “With such large swathes of Bitcoin concentrated within a tight price range, a move in either direction would send a significant amount of coins into a position of profit or loss, highlighting the acute sensitivity of our current position,” explains Glassnode. Major cost basis centers have historically played a notable role in the market because they act as important psychological levels. During bearish trends, investors prefer to sell when the prices fall to their cost basis, as they want to avoid getting into a loss. Similarly, holders prefer to buy more at their cost basis during bullish trends, considering it a profitable buying opportunity. It remains to be seen how the market will respond to the current situation in the coming days. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $26,000, down 5% in the last week.

The move further roiled crypto prices, with bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) down 2.6% to $26.48K and binance coin ( BNB-USD ) off 6.6% to $286.29 as of shortly before 12:00 p.m. ET. Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) also extended losses to new intraday lows, retreating 2.4% to $1.85K. The Wall Street regulator alleged that Binance mishandled customer funds and secretly sent them to a separate entity controlled by Zhao. 13 charges were filed against Binance and CZ, as he is known, including deceiving investors about the sufficiency of its systems to detect and control manipulative trading. The SEC also accused the platform of taking insufficient steps to prohibit U.S. investors from accessing its unregulated exchange. “As alleged, Zhao and Binance misled investors about their risk controls and corrupted trading volumes while actively concealing who was operating the platform, the manipulative trading of its affiliated market maker, and even where and with whom investor funds and crypto assets were custodied,"" said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. ""They attempted to evade U.S. securities laws by announcing sham controls that they disregarded behind the scenes so that they could keep high-value U.S. customers on their platforms,"" he added. The company is ""disappointed"" with the SEC suit, a Binance spokesperson told Seeking Alpha via email, adding ""we will vigorously defend our business and the industry. We respectfully disagree with the SEC’s allegations that Binance operated as an unregistered securities exchange or illegally offered and sold securities, including by offering BNB ( BNB-USD ), or the BUSD ( BUSD-USD ) fiat-backed stable coin."" (Added at 2:45 p.m. ET) This marks the second high-profile suit against Binance and Zhao since the end of March, when the Commodity and Futures Trade Commission accused the platform of breaching certain trading and derivatives rules. In 2019 and 2020, Binance controlled five bank accounts belonging to its independent U.S. affiliate, Binance.US, including one that held U.S. customers' money, Reuters reported , citing bank records.

According to Hoskinson, the scammers impersonate him to send messages to members of the ADA community. Related Reading: Bedrock Upgrade: How Optimism Game-Changer Could Impact OP Price In the post, the Cardano founder reiterated that he would “never email ADA holders directly.” He also disclosed that scammers have been trying different tactics to impersonate him and defraud ADA investors of their funds. Scammers Target ADA Community Members Hoskinson discovered the ongoing scam tactic through an unknown ADA enthusiast who contacted him about the malicious scheme. The ADA user reported that while impersonating him, the scammers sent emails concerning a newly launched project, the “Hoskinson Health and Wellness Clinic.” The scammers wrote that the launch of the medical facility is part of Hoskinson’s vision to build a “strong” ecosystem for Cardano. They also noted that the medical center, based in Wyoming, will include ADA as a payment option. The scammers’ emails mentioned that lives are easily lost when people fail to disclose their medical details on time. So, they stated that easy availability and accessibility of medical information through innovative technology like Cardano would help to save more lives promptly. Related Reading: XRP Climbs 12% As Crypto Celebrates 11-Year Milestone Further, the malicious email stated that the newly launched medical facility is the first medical multichain on the Cardano network. It mentioned that the impact of such a project on the blockchain ecosystem and in life could scale quite high once this kind of project reaches its peak. Finally, the email persuaded ADA investors to research the medical chain project more while increasing their investment holdings in ADA. Hoskinson Offers Some Tips To Identify Scammers While notifying the investors about the ongoing scam, Hoskinson laid out some tips on identifying scammers. Hoskinson noted that the tips would help to fish out those impersonating the Cardano founder. The founder advises members of the ADA community to verify the identity of senders of suspicious emails by requesting them to do so. To ensure security, the verification process should involve obtaining Hoskinson’s Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) key signature. Hoskinson has confirmed that scammers cannot replicate this signature. PGP keys are public encryption keys designed for the specific purposes of encrypting or signing emails, files, and directories. When you create a PGP key, the system generates a public and private key pair, enabling you to receive an encrypted message and open it. But you can send the public key to the sender and use your private key to decrypt the message when it comes. In that case, someone impersonating you cannot produce your public key, as Hoskinson pointed out. Meanwhile, ADA is trading at around $0.3748 when writing, indicating a drop of 1.78% over the past 24 hours. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that its market cap is about $ 13.07 billion.

Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Poised For Significant Breakout: Here’s What To Watch Out For Cardano (ADA) trades at $0.35 as of this writing, recording a 6% loss in the last 24 hours. In the last week, the cryptocurrency recorded a 7% and stands amongst the worst performers in the top 10 by market capitalization, only surpassed by Binance Coin (BNB). SEC Fight Against Binance Splashes Cardano (ADA) According to the complaint filed by the U.S. regulator in the District of Columbia, Binance has been offering “unregistered securities” since its inception. These alleged securities under U.S. laws include Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), Solana (SOL), Filecoin (FIL), Cosmos Hub (ATOM), Algorand (ALGO), and others. On the document, the SEC classifies ADA as a “crypto security,” a term which they coined in the last two years. The regulator provides an overview of the token’s history, claiming the following and potentially arguing against ADA’s decentralization: Today, three entities are responsible for Cardano: (1) the Cardano Foundation, a Swiss entity that is the legal custodian of the Cardano protocol and owner of its brand; (2) IOHK, an engineering company controlled by Hoskinson and Wood responsible for designing, building and maintaining the Cardano blockchain; and (3) Emurgo (…). To sustain their argument, the SEC claims that these entities hold over 16.7% of ADA’s total supply or 31.1 billion ADA. The regulator also claims that the companies sold the token to fund development, marketing, business operations, and other critical project areas. As of this writing, there is no official reply from these entities, or IOHK (IOG), the company behind Cardano’s development. Crypto Market Participating Over-reacting To Binance Lawsuit? Despite the lawsuit, some crypto community members call the event a “nothing burger.” The U.S. regulator is still to provide a clear legal framework for what constitutes a security in this country. In that sense, legal expert Collins Belton believes that today’s bad news could turn into a positive development for the long haul. Via his Twitter account, the expert stated: (…) this should actually be seen as a bit of a tension reliever for anyone that hasn’t been wildly deluded on Hopium. This complaint has been hanging above us like a sword of Damocles and letting it fall now in the depths of a bear is probably the best we could hope for.

On Monday, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accused cryptocurrency exchange Binance of allegedly mishandling customer funds and lying to investors and regulators about its operations. The SEC also sued Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, alleging that he and the exchange failed to restrict US customers from its platform and mislead investors about its market surveillance controls. The regulator further accused Binance of operating as an unregistered securities exchange, Reuters reports. In a press release, the SEC said: The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Binance Holdings Ltd. (“Binance”), which operates the largest crypto asset trading platform in the world, Binance.com; U.S.-based affiliate, BAM Trading Services Inc. (“BAM Trading”), which, together with Binance, operates the crypto asset trading platform, Binance.US; and their founder, Changpeng Zhao, with a variety of securities law violations. In a case filed in federal court in Washington, DC, the SEC said the exchange has been mixing “billions of dollars” in customer funds and secretly sent them to Merit Peak Limited, a separate company controlled by Zhao. The SEC’s complaint details that Binance and Zhao controlled customers’ assets, allowing them to mix and divert funds and that Binance created separate US entities “as part of an elaborate scheme to evade US federal securities laws.” Gary Gensler, Chair of the SEC, said: Through thirteen charges, we allege that Zhao and Binance entities engaged in an extensive web of deception, conflicts of interest, lack of disclosure, and calculated evasion of the law. Adding: As alleged, Zhao and Binance misled investors about their risk controls and corrupted trading volumes while actively concealing who was operating the platform, the manipulative trading of its affiliated market maker, and even where and with whom investor funds and crypto assets were custodied. They attempted to evade US securities laws by announcing sham controls that they disregarded behind the scenes so that they could keep high-value US customers on their platforms. The public should beware of investing any of their hard-earned assets with or on these unlawful platforms. CZ Dismisses Charges Zhao dismissed the charges on Twitter by saying “4,” a popular reference in the Binance community that urges users to ignore FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt). 4.Our team is all standing by, ensuring systems are stable, including withdrawals, and deposits. We will issue a response once we see the complaint. Haven't seen it yet. Media gets the info before we do.🙏 — CZ 🔶 Binance (@cz_binance) June 5, 2023 Zhao assured the community that Binance’s systems are stable, with deposits and withdrawals operating per usual. Binance published its response to the suit shortly after the news broke. The exchange said: We are disappointed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chose to file a complaint today against Binance seeking, among other remedies, purported emergency relief. From the start, we have actively cooperated with the SEC’s investigations and have worked hard to answer their questions and address their concerns. Most recently, we have engaged in extensive good-faith discussions to reach a negotiated settlement to resolve their investigations. But despite our efforts, with its complaint today the SEC abandoned that process and instead chose to act unilaterally and litigate. We are disheartened by that choice. Crack Down on Binance Continues The newest suit adds to the list of regulatory action taken against the exchange by US regulators. In March, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) sued Binance and Zhao, accusing the exchange of trading on its own platform and alleging that the founder partook in insider trading. CZ outright denied the allegations stating that Binance does not and will never trade for profit or “manipulate” the market. Despite CZ’s denial, users withdrew around $400 million in 24 hours from the exchange. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42410526,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdXGNS,1685982381,Binance Withdrawal On Track to be Largest Since March Crypto Banking Crisis,"Cryptocurrency traders are withdrawing funds from crypto exchange Binance at highest level since banking crisis in March, after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued the company and its CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao for violating federal securities law on Monday.  Blockchain data shows that the exchange endured some $503 million in net outflows on Monday, according to a Dune Analytics chart by crypto investment product provider 21Shares. Traders have withdrawn more than $1 billion of digital assets during this period, compared to the $546 million in deposits, per the chart.  This is on track to be the largest daily net outflow since at least mid-March, when investors worried about failing crypto-friendly banks destabilizing crypto exchanges, according to data by 21Shares.  Crypto intelligence firm Nansen's data showed that at one point Binance recorded $231 million more withdrawals than deposits within a one-hour period following the news about the lawsuit. The data excludes bitcoin (BTC) transfers.  While outflows are rising, this isn't necessarily out of the ordinary yet. In February, Binance weathered some 830 million of net outflows over a 24 hour period as New York state regulators cracked down on Binance-related stablecoin BUSD, CoinDesk reported.  Binance's crypto wallets hold some $55 billion of digital assets, according to Nansen data on exchange reserves.  The outflows came as the SEC lawsuit alleges that Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, breached multiple federal securities laws. The suit said that Binance offered unregistered crypto securities, including BNB and BUSD tokens, to the general public and allowed for commingling of customer funds.  The SEC also alleges that CZ, the company’s chief executive officer, was “secretly” in control of Binance.US, an ostensibly separate entity operating in the U.S., and a CZ-owned entity had inflated Binance.US’s trading volume.

42410511,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdXFgT,1685982310,Coinbase Shares Drop 10% Following SEC’s Suit Against Binance,"Shares of Coinbase (COIN) were down 10.3% after news broke that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was suing Binance on allegations of violating federal securities law on Monday.  “Coinbase shares are down sharply as it looks like U.S. regulation will deem many cryptos as securities,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange Oanda. “Coinbase wants regulatory clarity and it seems the SEC is going to cripple large parts of the cryptoverse.”  Coinbase stock fell more than 5% right after the filing was released and then continued to fall. Meanwhile, the price of bitcoin (BTC) fell more than 5% to below $26,000. Shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR), which holds a vast amount of bitcoin on its balance sheet, fell almost 9%, while the shares of several bitcoin mining stocks dropped as well. Riot Blockchain (RIOT) and Marathon Digital (MARA) both fell more than 9%, while Bitfarms (BITF) dropped more than 6%.  The SEC is accusing Binance of offering unregistered securities and staking services to the general public, among other allegations, as U.S. lawmakers double down on enforcement actions against crypto companies.  In March, Coinbase itself received a warning from the SEC that it may soon receive enforcement action tied to its listing of potential unregistered securities. The exchange has since doubled down on its presence in Canada, which it says has clearer rules for crypto firms than the U.S., making it easier to operate in the country.

42410512,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdXFjm,1685982087,The Lightning Network Doesn’t Fix Everything Wrong With Bitcoin,"The Bitcoin layer 2 protocol, the Lightning Network, is aptly named because, when it works, it works lightning fast. People love the Lightning Network.  And it makes sense that they do. Although it has some potential issues and shortcomings, it has much promise and could very well help solve Bitcoin’s scaling problems. But because it is promising, the Lightning Network has been pitched as the solution for everything.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Transaction fees too high? Lightning Network.  Blocks too small? Lightning Network.  Blocks too slow? Lightning Network.  Governments censoring transactions? Lightning Network.  Soup too hot? Lightning Network.  Soup too cold? Lightning Network.  No spoon? Lightning Network.  You get the point.  With bitcoin fees skyrocketing amid the recent Ordinals and BRC-20 craze, which so luckily lined up perfectly with the annual bitcoin pilgrimage to Bitcoin Magazine’s Bitcoin 2023 conference in Miami, the same answer found its way into conversations about some of Bitcoin’s problems on- and off-stage and on social media again and again.  The Lightning Network.  But not everyone thinks Lightning is a panacea for every Bitcoin problem. Some question whether it will be able to solve the problem it was intended to solve.  Which is to say, but say it softly: Maybe the Lightning Network isn’t the way Bitcoin can enable fast, cheap, casual, peer-to-peer transactions.  Read more: As Bitcoin Scales, We Need Better Custodial Solutions  There’s also a group of people who do and don’t want layers built on Bitcoin at all and think the base layer should ossify or stop changing.  Putting that aside for now, there’s a growing pragmatic view that the Lightning Network is or probably will be good for certain types of payments, but not all types of payments. That doesn’t mean either side is completely correct, but at least the hivemind doesn’t appear to be in control anymore.  Lightning Network might not solve everything and that’s okay. We should still try.  The Lightning Network very much was and still is an experimental technology. Proponents warn to this day to exercise caution when committing hard-earned bitcoin to the Lightning Network since you can easily lose funds if you aren’t experienced. And even then, a lot of the more popular Lightning-enabled wallets, like Wallet of Satoshi, work really well mostly because they are custodial.  The Lightning Network spurred many promising Bitcoin startups: THNDR Games, Voltage, CashApp, Strike, River, Amboss, Zebedee, IBEX, to name a few. Many Lightning proponents have even positioned the layer 2 protocol as a way to make bitcoin accessible to billions.  They may be right. In the future, when many people are using bitcoin, it will be theoretically cheaper to use the Lightning Network for everyday transactions which necessarily makes it more accessible, especially as wealth distribution varies so much across countries.  But the idea that Bitcoin can scale to billions isn’t taken for granted these days, and some see it as an outrageous proposition. More people using bitcoin could be a problem. Nobody knows if the Lightning Network will continue to be cheap if transaction fees start to rise.  There are no panaceas. Not the Lightning Network, not Stratum V2, not your favorite Bitcoin thing.  The end of investing every hope and dream in one Bitcoin spinoff is a good thing. Investing in false gods never works.  Bitcoin is decentralized and, so, it requires decentralized diversity of thought. It’s okay to champion the Lightning Network or Liquid or Ark or whatever your other thing might be. But there’s always a new project to come on Bitcoin, because it’s open-source, and that’s a good thing.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TECHNOLOGY,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/06/05/the-lightning-network-doesnt-fix-everything-wrong-with-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/85752456d7c27d65ab0f97de286f5cd80db9c88f-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ethereum Holdings Of Top 10 Whales Have Now Surpassed August 2015 ATH According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the largest ETH whales have grown their supplies recently. The largest whales here refer to the ten largest addresses on the Ethereum network that aren’t associated with a centralized platform. Santiment has identified such self-custodial addresses, and entities like exchanges have been excluded here because their role in the sector is different from that of the normal whales. As the whales hold huge amounts in their wallets, they can significantly influence the market since their movements may produce noticeable effects on the price. Thus, The ten largest whales are the most powerful investors on the network. Naturally, since their behavior may impact the market, their movements are worth watching. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Becoming Greener At An Unexpected Pace, Good For BTC Price? Now, here is a chart that shows how the combined balance of these large Ethereum whales has changed since the cryptocurrency first started trading back in 2015: Looks like the value of the metric has observed a sharp uptrend recently | Source: Santiment on Twitter As you can see in the above graph, the largest players in the Ethereum ecosystem have been constantly growing their supplies in the last few years. However, there was an exception to this trend when the bear market started in 2022 and crashes like the LUNA collapse and the 3AC bankruptcy occurred. These investors’ holdings had shrunk during this period, implying that they may have been participating in the market selloff. It wasn’t long, however, before these humongous holders started accumulating again. Their buying spree has also continued into the rally this year, and interestingly, the last couple of months have seen the supply of these investors observing an even sharper uptrend. The chart also shows the data for the Ethereum exchange supply, which is the total amount of ETH currently sitting in these platforms’ wallets. It seems like when the whales started accumulating a few years back; the exchange supply had started heading down instead. This may imply that the coins being withdrawn towards self-custody were being absorbed by this cohort. Though, while the exchange supply has continued to decline recently, its drawdown has been much weaker. As the top ten Ethereum whales have rapidly accumulated during the same period, it would appear that the source of their fresh buying isn’t from the exchange-held tokens anymore.

On the flip side, EOS (EOS), another prominent player in the crypto space, is projected to face a challenging future, potentially slipping below the crucial $1 support level. Meanwhile, Sparklo, a newcomer in the crypto arena, is making remarkable strides, demonstrating rapid progress that has captured the industry's attention. 2023 Forecasts: Sparklo's Impressive Growth Trajectory Sparklo is set to revolutionize how we invest in precious metals in the digital realm. Making waves with its groundbreaking model, Sparklo allows investors to buy parts of a Non-Fungible Token (NFT), each one representing a physical asset. Additionally, the platform enables purchasing a complete NFT, with the tangible precious metal delivered to the owner. Currently progressing through its second presale phase, Sparklo positions itself as a lucrative venture for aspiring investors. With a current price tag of just $0.030, renowned crypto analysts predict an impressive rise in Sparklo's value. Forecasts indicate an extraordinary 1,500% increase by the end of 2023, highlighting the potential rewards on offer. The Sparklo smart contract's robustness has received the nod of approval from the Interfinetwork after rigorous auditing. To prevent any potential rugpull situations, the Sparklo team has committed to locking the liquidity for a hundred years, demonstrating their long-term vision. Backed by extensive research and promising prospects, Sparklo is shaping to be a promising investment contender for 2023. Interested investors can purchase tokens via the platform's linked partners. >>>> BUY SPARKLO TOKENS Aave (AAVE) 2023 Forecast: DeFi Surge Bolstering Bullish Trajectory In light of the escalating popularity of decentralized finance (DeFi), Aave's (AAVE/USD) 2023 trajectory seems promisingly bullish. With predictions indicating a top between $700 and $750, Aave (AAVE) is set to harness the power of this newfound adoption of digital currencies and their decentralized protocols. Further supporting this bullish trend, experts forecast a potential peak at $1,500 within the next two years, suggesting a sustained growth phase for Aave (AAVE) that could push trading values as high as $2,500 by 2026. These Aave (AAVE) projections are based on historic price trends and the increasing embracement of cryptocurrencies. Founded in 2017 by Stani Kuchelov, Aave (AAVE) has evolved into a robust decentralized lending and borrowing protocol. Aave (AAVE) has paved the way for quicker loan processing with a revolutionary DeFi model that eliminates the need for matching lenders and borrowers. EOS (EOS) in 2023: A Decline Towards Sub-Dollar Territory Entering 2023, EOS (EOS), a popular cryptocurrency, faces challenging market dynamics. Ranked 49th in the crypto industry, the resilience of EOS is evident despite the 2022 crypto fallout. The strength of the EOS (EOS) network - a thriving and well-knit community of traders - ensures that EOS (EOS) maintains a foothold in the industry, irrespective of market fluctuations. However, EOS (EOS) current trajectory reveals a downward trendline, suggesting a dip below the $1 psychological support level. As of May 25th, 2023, EOS (EOS) to USDT trades at $0.861996, showing a decrease of 0.74% from the previous price. By the end of 2023, EOS is projected to hover around the $1.14 mark, with a bottom lineexpectation of not less than $1.10. Although this shows signs of a possible return to its 2021 value of $2.77, it's essential to consider the market conditions and the factors affecting the cryptocurrency. Like other cryptos, EOS undergoes similar fluctuations, and the future growth patterns largely depend on the coin's inherent features and the broader crypto market sentiment.

42410521,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdXG0J,1685978110,"SEC Sues Crypto Exchange Binance and CEO Changpeng Zhao, Alleging Multiple Securities Violations","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued crypto exchange Binance, the operating company for Binance.US and Binance founder and CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao on allegations of violating federal securities laws on Monday.  Binance, Binance.US and CZ offered unregistered securities to the general public in the form of the BNB token and Binance-linked BUSD stablecoin, said the suit, which also alleges that Binance's staking service violated securities law. There are similar charges against BAM Trading – the operating company for Binance.US – and Binance itself, including failure to register as a clearing agency, failure to register as a broker and failure to register as an exchange. The SEC also alleged that Binance allowed for commingling of customer funds, that CZ was ""secretly"" controlling Binance.US and that a CZ-owned and operated entity was inflating Binance.US's trading volume.  Read More: Binance Endures $69M in Net Outflows Within an Hour, Amid SEC Charge: Nansen  The suit also alleged multiple times that Binance allowed U.S. persons (meaning U.S. citizens or people living in the U.S.) to trade on its platform, despite saying it wasn't.  ""As a second part of Zhao’s and Binance’s plan to shield themselves from U.S. regulation, they consistently claimed to the public that the Binance.com Platform did not serve U.S. persons, while simultaneously concealing their efforts to ensure that the most valuable U.S. customers continued trading on the platform,"" the suit said. ""When the Binance.US Platform launched in 2019, Binance announced that it was implementing controls to block U.S. customers from the Binance.com Platform. In reality, Binance did the opposite. Zhao directed Binance to assist certain high-value U.S. customers in circumventing those controls and to do so surreptitiously because – as Zhao himself acknowledged – Binance did not want to 'be held accountable' for these actions.""  The SEC also alleged that a number of other tokens, including the native coins for the Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), Coti (COTI) and Algorand blockchains (ALGO), Filecoin network (FIL), Cosmos hub (ATOM), Sandbox platform (SAND), Axie infinity (AXS) and Decentraland (MANA) are securities.  Binance's own Chief Compliance Officer told another employee in 2018 that ""we are operating as a fking unlicensed securities exchange in the USA,"" the suit said.  Commingling and diverting funds  Binance and its poor financial controls meant that customer funds were diverted, including potentially for personal uses, the suit said. Merit Peak Limited, a market maker previously tied to Zhao, had access to ""billions of U.S. dollars of customer funds,"" while Sigma Chain, another CZ-controlled entity, received nearly $200 million from BAM Trading and a BAM Trading custody account, the SEC alleged. CZ himself allegedly ""personally received $62.5 million from one of the Binance bank accounts"" between October 2022 and January 2023.  ""Lacking regulatory oversight, Defendants were free to and did transfer investors’ crypto and fiat assets as Defendants pleased, at times commingling and diverting them in ways that properly registered brokers, dealers, exchanges and clearing agencies would not have been able to do,"" the suit said.  Sigma Chain also bought a yacht for $11 million from the account that had access to customer funds, the SEC said.  According to the suit, CZ owned 100% of an entity called ""CPZ Holdings Limited,"" which in turn owned 100% of ""BAM Management Company Limited,"" which for its part owned 81% of ""BAM Management US Holdings Inc.,"" with the remaining equity going to seed investors and former employees. BAM Management US was the parent company to BAM Trading Services, which in turn operates Binance.US.  The SEC revealed internal struggles U.S. CEOs had with CZ and top Binance officials controlling the U.S. operations despite assurances of independence. The U.S. operations complained of ""shackles"" that demanded its managers get approval from the global company for basic functions.  Read More: Coinbase Shares Drop 10% Following SEC’s Suit Against Binance  ""I realized, huh, I'm not actually the one running this company, and the mission that I believe I signed up for isn't the mission. And as soon as I realized that, I left,"" former U.S. CEO Brian Brooks – who took over after running the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency – is quoted as saying, though he's identified only as ""CEO B"" in the suit. Brooks resigned after just three months at the helm of Binance's U.S. arm.  Brooks had particular worries about what Merit Peak and Sigma Chain were doing on the Binance.US platform.  ""Our customers couldn't, you know, clear orders without the presence of those makers on our platform, I thought that was a real problem,"" Brooks is quoted as saying. ""It suggested that the company was, in fact, heavily dependent on CZ, not just as a control person but also as an economic counterparty.""  Catherine Coley, who was the U.S. operations' first CEO, complained internally at one point that her ""entire team is at their breaking point,"" according to the suit, which identified her as ""CEO A.""  At one point, Coley tried to pursue what she called ""Project 1776"" – a reference to the American Revolution. She told a fellow employee it was ""for our independence,” according to the suit.  Evading regulation  Part of the SEC suit references the so-called ""Tai Chi"" documents, which Forbes originally reported on in 2020, which appeared to be a plan for Binance to officially exit the U.S. while still maintaining a presence through an affiliate.  The suit quotes Binance employees discussing ways to allow U.S. customers to trade on binance.com.  Also of concern: Binance had access to Binance.US's wallets and assets, and had access to the U.S. entity's custody tools and private keys, the SEC alleged.  The company also tapped market makers – specifically Merit Peak and Sigma Chain – to boost trading volume on Binance.US. This created conflicts of interest between CZ and Binance.US's customers, the SEC alleged.  ""To create and maintain liquidity on the Binance.US Platform, BAM Trading recruited market making firms and other institutions, often offering low fees as incentives. Zhao and Binance were intimately involved in these efforts, which placed Zhao’s financial interests at odds with those of the customers trading on the platform he controlled,"" the SEC said.  The suit also noted that Binance.US operates its own OTC desk, and over a two-year period, its only counterparty was Alameda Research, which was founded by FTX creator Sam Bankman-Fried. Alameda, alongside the rest of the FTX empire, collapsed last November.  'Vigorously defend'  In a long tweet, Binance.US called the suit ""the latest example of regulation by enforcement,"" and said it believed the suit was ""baseless.""  Binance shared a statement on its blog, saying the company had ""actively cooperated with the SEC's investigations and have worked hard to answer their questions and address their concerns,"" as well as work toward a settlement.  ""To be clear: any allegations that user assets on the Binance.US platform have ever been at risk are simply wrong, and there is zero justification for the Staff’s action in light of the ample time the Staff has had to conduct their investigation. All user assets on Binance and Binance affiliate platforms, including Binance.US, are safe and secure, and we will vigorously defend against any allegations to the contrary,"" the statement said.

An SEC spokesperson referred CoinDesk to a press release shared by the agency. A Binance spokesperson sent CoinDesk a similar statement to its blog post, saying the tokens named by the SEC are not securities.  The SEC lawsuit adds to allegations brought in March of this year by the U.S. regulator Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) that Binance and its founder Changpeng Zhao knowingly offered unregistered crypto derivatives products in the U.S. against federal law. Many of the allegations in the SEC's lawsuit also resembles the CFTC's complaint.  In a tweet, CZ tweeted ""4,"" essentially calling the news ""fud,"" (for fear, uncertainty and doubt).  Penalties  The SEC is seeking to halt Binance, Binance.US and ""each of their respective agents,"" etc. from continuing to violate federal laws, disgorge any ""ill-gotten gains"" with prejudgement interest and pay civil penalties.  The SEC also wants to bar CZ from being an officer or director of any securities issuer, and block Binance, Binance.US and CZ from participating or trading any securities, ""including crypto asset securities.""  This would also include blocking the defendants from acting as an unregistered broker, clearing agency or exchange with any crypto asset securities, the suit said.  Read the full suit at this link.

Hailed as Apple's first major product release in a decade, the tech giant's share price has risen by 7.4% in the past two weeks, a trend that has been matched by virtual reality and metaverse crypto tokens today.  Decentraland (MANA) is considered the largest VR-related token with a market cap just shy of $1 billion, and is up by 5.4% over the past 24 hours despite the wider crypto market shedding 1.5% of its value over the same time period, according to CoinGecko.

Goldman Sachs noted in a research report last year Apple is one of two companies leading the way in virtual and augmented reality.  The tech giant is expected to mass release a mixed reality headset in Q4 of this year, according to a recent Morgan Stanley investor note.  The wider metaverse sector has suffered during the crypto winter, with several assets falling more than 80% from their all-time highs. However, the recent bounce indicates that the tide may be shifting.

The price of VELO has dropped around 8% in the past 24 hours to $0.088 at press time.  Velodrome - the largest decentralized exchange (DEX) on layer 2 network Optimism (OP) - will upgrade June 15 to its second version, an entire redesign of the protocol aimed at improving end-user experience and security as well as simplifying smart-contract architecture.  The second iteration of Velodrome will include several new features, including a frontend that was rebuilt from scratch, customizable pool fees that allow for dynamic voting rewards and concentrated liquidity pools.  The price of VELO - the native utility token for Velodrome used to reward liquidity providers - has declined about 8% in the past 24 hours to 8.8 cents at press time, data from CoinGecko shows. Velodrome’s total value locked stands at more than $230 million, a roughly 4% decrease in the past week, per DefiLlama.

Governments can’t be trusted to build public digital money without using it to conduct surveillance on their citizens, many participants said in roundtable discussions held during the April conference. This cautious sentiment was echoed by the broader Consensus audience.  Among 169 attendees who answered an electronic survey during the three-day April conference, only 9% answered that it was unequivocally possible to design and build a surveillance-free government-backed digital currency. The largest proportion, 39%, agreed that doing so was technically possible but worried governments wouldn’t allow digital currencies to operate with a guarantee of privacy.  This article is excerpted from CoinDesk’s inaugural Consensus @ Consensus Report, the product of intimate, curated group discussions that took place at Consensus 2023. Click here to download the full report.  The crypto sector is “generally negative and worried when it comes to CBDCs, especially around privacy,” said Arry Yu, co-chair of the U.S. Blockchain Coalition, one of the participants in the roundtable discussions who chose to speak on the record. (The session, which drew 135 participants, was conducted under the Chatham House rule.)  Some participants in the discussion at Consensus argued that embracing a digital dollar is vital for the U.S. to maintain the dollar’s dominant role as the global reserve currency. Many suggested the nation will be forced to catch up to competitors that are already far ahead.  “The world will have CBDCs and stablecoins whether we like it or not, and whether the U.S. chooses to lead or follow,” said J. Christopher Giancarlo, the former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, during a keynote address at Consensus.  “Digital currencies that effectively protect financial privacy in lawful transactions will be the world’s most desired,” said Giancarlo, now executive chairman of the Digital Dollar Project, a group encouraging research and discussion of a virtual greenback.  Read More: The U.S. Should Lead the Digital Future of Money  Privacy was at the center of the discussion at Consensus, and participants hit on several suggestions for dodging a future dystopia.  Discussants at Consensus proposed that CBDCs use open source code, inspectable by anyone, and a transparent minting process that would discourage stealth inflation measures.  The group argued that sovereign digital money should strive to share the same privacy benefits as cash. One popular idea was that users maintain control of data that’s collected about their financial activity, while the discussion also touched on the possibility that smaller, lower-risk CBDC transactions could be granted the highest level of privacy….

42410515,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdXFth,1685974515,Introducing CoinDesk’s First-Ever ‘Consensus @ Consensus’ Report,"The cryptocurrency community has a great story to tell, but it urgently needs to tell it.  At least, that is a recurrent theme throughout CoinDesk’s first-ever Consensus @ Consensus report, out today. Based primarily on intimate group discussions that took place at Consensus 2023, it covers a wide range of pressing issues challenging the digital assets industry. These include the newly urgent subject of regulation, the competing demands of privacy and law enforcement, the difficulty of bringing self-custody to the mainstream, the future of crypto media, and more. The discussion groups, which convened largely offstage in Austin, Texas, from April 26-28, 2023, represented a cross-section of interested parties – including developers, investors, government officials, entrepreneurs, and nonprofits.  Amid that variety of topics and diversity of perspectives, the one clear through-line, the refrain that I kept reading over and over as I edited the 11 chapters, was that this global movement has to remember why it exists in the first place – and clearly explain that purpose to the wider world.  This article is excerpted from CoinDesk’s inaugural Consensus @ Consensus Report, the product of intimate, curated group discussions that took place at Consensus 2023. Click here to download the full report.  Following the crypto crash of 2022, governments and the general public are apt to view this technology as a get-rich-quick scheme, a hive of hucksters and fraudsters. This perception is understandable, in part because such unsavory characters always flock to crypto during bull markets, and especially because the last boom-bust cycle drew in institutional and mainstream retail investment as never before, causing more widespread damage when the bubble inevitably burst.  As I’m fond of saying, the casual observer could be forgiven for missing the beauty of a horse when there are so many flies buzzing around its behind.  Despite a relatively upbeat mood among the 15,000 attendees from 97 countries who attended Consensus 2023, the specter of Sam Bankman-Fried’s failed FTX exchange loomed large over the event. Bankman-Fried explicitly said he was in the business to make a fast fortune (albeit because he supposedly wanted to donate his winnings to good causes). Thanks in no small part to his deceptions, along with similarly reckless behavior by less prominent figures during the febrile period from 2021-2022, life savings have been lost, politicians are out for blood, and the U.S. securities and banking regulators have gone from lukewarm to hostile in their stance toward the industry.  See also: 5 Consensus 2023 Takeaways | CoinDesk Chief Content Officer Michael Casey  Overshadowed by all this drama are the developers, creators and entrepreneurs who still believe in crypto’s foundational ideals of openness, transparency (for the powerful), privacy (for the weak) and decentralization. They stick around after the price charts turn red and build for the long term. Whatever the future holds, it belongs to them.  However, the consensus at Consensus, as it were, is that they need to get the word out about how their projects benefit (or will benefit) everyday users, in order to mitigate the inevitable, ongoing tightening of the regulatory screws.  “I think what the industry could benefit from is affirmative efforts at positive narratives,” is a representative quote from a participant in one of the private roundtable discussions….

One of the investors is Tether, the issuer of stablecoin USDT, according to a separate press release shared with CoinDesk.  The mining site will be powered with 169 MW of solar and 72 MW of wind energy to bring computing power of over 1.3 exahash/second (EH/s), the press releases said. It will be located in Metapán, Santa Ana, in the country's northwest.  The government will play ""a crucial role"" in planning and execution and has secured a ""preferred participation equivalent to 23% of revenues,"" said Volcano. The outside investors will own 27% of the venture and the remaining 50% will be ""reinvested"" to expand energy production and mining capacities, the firm said.  Earlier mining initiatives have been focused on El Salvador's geothermal energy potential, but it was unclear how this new solar and wind energy park would be connected with volcanic activity. In its press release, Volcano mentioned that this mining site is intended as a ""pathway to our geothermal future,"" but didn't clarify the roadmap.  Tether has been trying to diversify its ""strategic ecosystem"" and Volcano Energy represents one of ""the most ground-breaking"" initiatives it has backed, said Chief Technology Officer Paolo Ardoino. The stablecoin issuer has been busy on the investment front in the past few weeks, including on bitcoin mining in Uruguay and purchasing bitcoin to add to its reserves backing USDT.  As opportunities for new developments have been limited in North America, mining firms and others have been looking elsewhere for investments in places such as Latin America and the Middle East.

Binance.US had to ask Chen and her team to process payments, including the firm's payroll, according to the report, which also cited company messages.  Binance.US has always claimed to be independent from Binance.  Christian Hertenstein, a spokesperson for Binance.US, told Reuters that since Brian Schroder became CEO of the company in late 2021, ""no one other than Binance.US officials have had control or access"" to its accounts.

The stablecoin, which began trading Monday, uses both hard- and soft-peg mechanisms to keep its price around $1, according to the protocol’s documents. The hard peg depends on arbitrage to maintain a stable price, while the soft peg relies on incentivizing users to act based on “the expectation that the peg will be kept in the future.”  Raft’s stablecoin is “the first stablecoin collateralized by Lido Staked Ether (stETH),” according to a statement.  While the biggest stablecoins, Tether’s USDT and Circle Internet Financial’s USDC, are backed by conventional assets like U.S. Treasurys, those backed instead by crypto assets have had mixed success. MakerDAO’s DAI, which is collateralized by a combination of Ethereum-based tokens, stablecoins and real-world assets such as U.S. government bonds, has accumulated about $4.6 billion of market capitalization. Meanwhile, Do Kwon’s UST – which was backed by his LUNA token – collapsed spectacularly a year ago.  Both DAI and this new R product differ from Kwon’s costly experiment because, while they don’t hold old-school bonds, their assets are issued by unrelated entities, whereas Kwon’s was his own token.  Following the U.S. banking crisis in March that depegged multiple stablecoins including Circle’s USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, a slew of crypto protocols have been focused on avoiding fiat assets as collateral to shield from ongoing regulatory pressures and exposure to banks.  Raft’s deployment of its lending protocol allows users to deposit stETH and borrow a minimum amount of $3,000. ""This strategic design choice is not only about attracting larger players in the liquid staking ecosystem, but it also ensures a healthy balance in the protocol, providing adequate incentives for coverages in the rare event of a position requiring liquidation.” said Raft’s Head of Marketing Tony T., in an exclusive interview with CoinDesk. He declined to give his last name.",POSITIVE,USDT | DAI | USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | USDT | DAI | USDC,Sage D.

42410507,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdXFTF,1685970852,3 Reasons Why Beauty on the Blockchain Makes Sense,"In the beauty and fashion worlds, creative collaborations are everything. Look no further than New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art, which through the years has partnered with several iconic beauty brands — including the time it released a custom-designed Estée Lauder eyeshadow palette for the art institution’s 150th birthday.  A good collaboration in any industry pushes boundaries, inspiring customers to experiment with new ideas and forms of self-expression. So it’s no wonder that skincare and makeup brands are entering Web3 with the same aspirational energy that the beauty industry has always served.  Through new forms of digital artistry and cutting-edge technological innovation, today’s leading beauty companies hope to reach Web3-native consumers, create meaningful experiences and perhaps even clean up their supply chain.  It helps brands expand to new audiences  Yann Joffredo, Global Brand President at NYX Professional Makeup, said that the L’Oréal-owned cosmetics brand has always championed inclusivity through its collaborations with independent content creators, bloggers and makeup artists. Joffredo sees Web3 as the next evolution of this mission, with the added benefit of connecting with new audiences.  “As the brand continues to evolve, it is important to advocate for this same representation in Web3,” said Joffredo. “Additionally, we understood the untapped territory within beauty in the metaverse.”  In early 2023, NYX launched GORJS, the world’s first beauty-focused decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to spotlight creators building beauty experiences within the Web3 ecosystem.  “GORJS integrates Web3 artists and beauty enthusiasts to lead the cultural conversation around what digital makeup artistry will be in the metaverse and beyond,” Joffredo said.  It fosters meaningful opportunities for self-expression  Joffredo also said that transparency and self-expression in the metaverse is a natural extension of NYX Professional Makeup’s brand values, adding that digital spaces give beauty enthusiasts unique avenues to express themselves and interact with products.  More poignantly, digital spaces can also provide physical safety amid a politically polarized physical world. Last year, NYX partnered with inclusive avatar company People Of Crypto (POC) and The Sandbox, a user-generated virtual environment, to launch a week-long Pride Month celebration. The event featured gender non-conforming NFT avatars donning makeup styled in a pixelated, or rather “voxelized,” fashion using colors representing the Progress Pride flag.  In a recent panel at the extended reality (XR) industry conference, AWE Live, NYX vice president of digital innovation and e-commerce Maya Kosovalic spoke to how the Pride event foreshadowed a more immersive digital future: “Self-expression is really the core tenant of future gaming platform experiences, which are no longer singular, solitary game loops but very immersive, engaging social experiences where younger generations can engage with their in-real-life friends.”  Celebrating one’s personality and identity through skins and digital goods, she added, is what makes Web3 so interesting for both beauty and fashion brands.  Also on the panel was Agustina Sartori, senior innovation director at the American beauty store chain Ulta Beauty. “Beauty is a way to be yourself and be who you want to be,” she said. “Why wouldn't we care about the same thing in the digital world?”  According to Sartori, Ulta Beauty has been experimenting with digital activations on Roblox since 2022. Roblox is a popular user-generated gaming platform that does not utilize blockchain or cryptocurrency but nonetheless appeals to major brands interested in building virtual worlds for customers. Ulta’s virtual Roblox world is called the “Ultaverse.” In May, Ulta Beauty partnered with the cruelty-free eyeshadow brand Urban Decay to throw a virtual party inside the Ultaverse. Makeup influencers Emmy Combs, Leilani Green and Manny MUA hosted the event, which attracted some 500,000 visitors to the platform, said Sartori.  Ulta Beauty was also one of the first beauty brands to announce its participation in the upcoming Metaverse Beauty Week, which will take place from June 12 to 16 in three different metaverse environments (Decentraland, Roblox and Spatial). Interested participants can learn how to set up the necessary crypto wallets and create their first avatar by reading instructions on the event website.  It could solve trust issues  Last, blockchain offers potential solutions for one of the most consistent challenges faced by the beauty industry: greenwashing. Amid growing market pressure to be cruelty-free, eco-friendly and natural, clean beauty brands have been on the receiving end of increased scrutiny in recent years.  It’s almost impossible for consumers to track their favorite brands’ ingredients sourcing. But now, there are many supply chain-related use cases for blockchain — most of them still new. The blockchain-based platform created by French luxury skincare company Clarins allows customers to trace their products’ manufacturing journeys on chain. By scanning a QR code on each package, people can trace ingredients’ origins and learn about how the product was made and even packaged.  Another way blockchain can help boost trust issues is by weeding out counterfeit products, which is a growing issue in the world of “superfakes.” Luxury fashion giant LMVH launched a blockchain to help prove the authenticity of Louis Vuitton bags and Parfums Christian Dior.  Unrelated to supply chains, other beauty brand blockchain experiments include experimental bitcoin “cash-back” programs that incentivize consumers by rewarding them with satoshis for each purchase.  Blockchain-based beauty is exciting, but still experimental  As we see in all facets of Web3, the beauty industry is still experimenting with how to most seamlessly use new technology to create lasting impact among its existing and emerging customer base.  “This is a process and it will take time,” said Leya Kaufman, head of brand, publisher and senior vice president of sales at media company Coveteur. “We will need to cultivate and engage audiences in this new arena while simultaneously maintaining our core consumer base,” she said.  Alongside leading Web3 infrastructure provider, MoonPay, Coveteur partnered with hair care company Wella Professionals to launch The Wella Generator, a gamified digital sweepstakes hosted on the Ethereum blockchain.  “It was important for us to create a program that was seamless for existing and new Web3 users,” Kaufman said, adding that the partnership with MoonPay made this vision possible.  Despite growing pains, as digital identity becomes an increasingly important factor in our lives and personalities, it makes sense that people want to feel good about how they look and shop, both on-chain and off, and it looks like blockchain is very on-trend for beauty brands in the future.

According to the statement, Elliptic expects that they “will be able to synthesize and organize intelligence on new risk factors in higher volumes and at a quicker speed than ever before.” Elliptic has been at the forefront of cryptocurrency risk management and security. It recently published a report (commissioned by Nikkei Asia) on the cryptocurrency losses inflicted by North Korean hackers from 2017-2022. The report said that Asian countries, with Japan at the top, made up three of the four hotspots of hacking. Japan is estimated to have lost $721 million in cyberattacks. Now, Elliptic has taken steps to improve their solutions with the help of ChatGPT. With the ChatGPT integration, Elliptic aims to bolster its capabilities in risk analysis and threat detection. According to CEO Simone Maini, their continuous pursuit of cutting-edge technology is crucial to their mission. ""We pride ourselves in being on the forefront of blockchain innovation, and incorporating cutting-edge technologies to enhance how we work without compromising the high standards for which we are known is part of our DNA,” she stated. The success of ChatGPT has attracted the attention of many in the crypto space and see a world full of potentials enabled by the LLM. Solana (SOL) has recently announced their plans to integrate the LLM through a plug-in and enable user interaction with the Solana network itself. The plug-in will enable users to ask questions and have them promptly answered by ChatGPT. At the same time, Solana has also announced a grant program for AI-focused projects built on the network. The use of AI for crypto projects, and especially for risk management and security is not without its risks. Many have noted the LLM’s shortcomings and limitations especially when dealing with more complex queries.

42410524,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdXGK9,1685966851,First Mover Americas: Is Bitcoin Heading Below $26K?,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin (BTC) is down almost 2% over the last 24 hours and back below $27,000 at $26,700 as investors continue to weigh the implications of the U.S. debt ceiling deal and last Friday’s strong employment report. U.S. stock index futures are little-changed Monday morning following last week’s strong rally in equities.Laurent Kssis, crypto advisor at CEC Capital, sees bitcoin dropping below $26,000 this week. “With summer getting closer, no obvious catalysts, dealers are not keeping inventories and any large selling order may trigger selling pressure,” he said, noting that long liquidations are currently triple those of short liquidations.  Retail demand for bitcoin is likely to remain strong over the coming year ahead of the next halving event for the world’s largest cryptocurrency, JPMorgan said in a research report Thursday. Recent increase in retail demand can be partly attributed to the advent of Bitcoin Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens, wrote the bank’s analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglo, but the more important boost in strengthening investor interest will be thanks to the approach of the April 2024 “halving.” Part of bitcoin’s original code, halvings occur every 210,000 blocks, or roughly every four years. At these events, bitcoin mining rewards are cut by 50%. This effectively doubles bitcoin production costs, according to the JPMorgan team, and creates “a positive psychological effect.”  The appointment of Richard Teng to oversee Binance’s regional markets outside the U.S. has positioned the one-time Abu Dhabi regulator as the most likely successor to Changpeng Zhao, who founded the world’s largest crypto exchange in 2017. The enhanced role follows a report last month that Zhao, commonly known as CZ, is looking to reduce his ownership of Binance.US, the firm's American arm – a move that's seen as something of an appeasement to U.S. regulators. Teng's knowledge and experience as a regulator will come to bear in his new role overseeing Asia, Europe, the Middle East and North Africa as the exchange, often targeted by authorities, attempts to draw a line under mounting enforcement actions related to conduct during crypto’s early years. Prior to heading up the Financial Services Regulatory Authority at Abu Dhabi Global Market, Teng was chief regulatory officer of Singapore Exchange (SGX) and spent 13 years with the Monetary Authority of Singapore. In an interview with CoinDesk, Teng sidestepped the idea that he’s being groomed to take the reins from the 46-year-old CEO.

Bitcoin is scarce with a fixed supply. Do the Maths. Purchasing power is dwindling fast For the average Joe and Jane, finding enough money (currency) to pay the bills always seems to get more and more difficult with each passing year. Both of them probably work, unlike their parents or grandparents who seemed to get along on just one wage. The last few years had seemed much worse. Since the Pandemic, when bank accounts were pretty flush with government handouts, things have begun to get more problematic. Now, many families are not able to save, and if they had to find just a few hundred dollars for an unexpected shortfall, they probably wouldn’t be able to produce it. What has happened is that governments have printed their way out of the Pandemic, and if we are really being factual, they have been printing more and more currency for many decades because that is the only way this debt-based system stays afloat. The countries of the world all use a fiat monetary system, and since the US dollar came off of its gold backing in 1971, they have remained pegged to a currency that is being printed with gay abandon at the expense of the purchasing power of all citizens. There is only one destination for all fiat currencies and that is zero, just like every fiat currency in the history of the world. The average lifespan of a fiat currency is only 27 years. Since the creation of the US Federal Reserve system in 1913, the dollar has fallen in purchasing power. One dollar at the time of the Pandemic in 2020 was worth more than $26 back in 1913. With trillions being added since the outbreak of Covid in 2020, that figure has become far worse. Also, with the Federal Reserve probably loosening its monetary policy as the US heads towards recession, and given that the debt ceiling has no ceiling for the next 2 years, at least another $4 trillion will be added to the debt pile, and will further eat away at the purchasing power of all. Bitcoin is the way out Bitcoin will only ever have a supply of 21 million coins. It is hugely decentralised, incredibly secure, and well out of the reach of any government to confiscate or manipulate. The average Joe and Jane have a way to get any savings out of failing banks and into Bitcoin. The mainstream narrative on Bitcoin is a cover to prevent people from doing the obvious thing. Education is the only way to help people protect themselves from what is to come. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42410522,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdXGAE,1685959000,Bitcoin Retail Demand to Remain Strong Ahead of Halving Event: JPMorgan,"Retail demand for bitcoin (BTC) is likely to remain strong over the coming year ahead of the next halving event for the world’s largest cryptocurrency, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report Thursday.  Recent increase in retail demand can be partly attributed to the advent of Bitcoin Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens, the report said, but more importantly “retail investor demand for bitcoin is likely to strengthen as we approach the April 2024 halving event.”  Bitcoin halving, when mining rewards are cut by 50%, “would mechanically double bitcoin production cost to around $40,000, creating a positive psychological effect,” analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.  This is because historically the production cost has acted as an effective lower boundary to the cryptocurrency’s price, the report added.  Previous halving events in 2016 and 2020 “were accompanied by a bullish trajectory for bitcoin prices” that accelerated after they occurred, the bank noted.  In contrast, institutional demand for bitcoin has been falling, with investors discouraged by “fraud, heightened volatility and a year-to-date U.S. regulatory assault” that has led to increased uncertainty.  JPMorgan previously argued that gold and bitcoin both rallied strongly following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank as investors regarded these asset classes as “hedges to a catastrophic scenario,” with institutional investors buying gold and retail buying bitcoin.

Decentralized storage is a staple subsector of the cryptocurrency market, offering users secure and reliable methods to store large amounts of data without trusting a centralized actor. Major competitors include Arweave, Storj, and Siacoin, each offering different user interfaces and storage methods. Filecoin ( FIL-USD) , Arweave ( AR-USD ), Storj ( STORJ-USD ), and Siacoin ( SC-USD ) all have seats at the table in the decentralized storage race with the potential to capitalize on a key crypto trend: future blockchain and crypto adoption will require exponential storage demand for blockspace. Decentralization, one of the pillars of blockchain technology, will be required of storage just like any other critical blockchain function. The problem is storing data on blockchains like Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) can be expensive and inefficient. Storing data with a centralized provider like Amazon or Alphabet creates a single point of a failure, going against everything blockchain technologies stand for. Further, and maybe most important, decentralized storage solutions are already far cheaper than the large, centralized data storage providers like Alphabet and Amazon. Therefore, as blockchain goes so too does decentralized storage. All of these tokens previously mentioned create value from their network of storage providers and storage demanders; all actions on the networks require their respective, native tokens. The more storage is demanded on each network, the more their token is demanded. Decentralized Storage Players (Messari) The Leader in the Clubhouse: Filecoin One thing to note right off the bat: the decentralized data storage world is Filecoin's to lose. However, Filecoin's revenue slid from $596 million in 2021 to just $13 million in 2022. This is a 98% drop, although the numbers are deceiving. Filecoin's network was expensive to use in 2021, which while great for generating revenue in the mania of the 2021 bull run, is unsustainable for long term client retention. As the crypto market collapsed, Filecoin was making their network more efficient and cheaper to use. The revenue drop is significant, but Filecoin is still generating significantly more revenue than their competitors. More importantly, they're playing the long game and sacrificing revenue now for long-term, sustainable demand down the road. Messari Filecoin revenue is generated by both the supply and demand side, meaning fees are taken from users purchasing file storage and users accessing their stored files. See image below for clarity:​​ Filecoin Revenue Sources (Filecoin) Around $1.3 billion in token incentives were paid out in 2022 as a way to incentivize network adoption, a common method in the crypto universe. Look at the trailing 12-month chart of Filecoin revenue (green) versus Filecoin Earnings (Purple). They are basically subsidizing their growth with token incentives now to establish market dominance and generate positive earnings in the future. This is no different than Amazon sacrificing profits early on in order to dominate the online retail space as we know it today. Filecoin Revenue (green) and Earnings (purple) (Token Terminal) While the above chart is ugly, earnings looks to be trending in the right direction towards profitability. So the question is, is the massive cost of adoption worth it for Filecoin? The best way to evaluate this is storage demand, and the following two charts are promising: Filecoin Usage (Messari) Filecoin Daily New Deals (Messari) Storage demand is on the rise, which is the only trend that matters for Filecoin in their quest for data storage domination. At the time of writing, Filecoin stores over 740x the data than any of the three competitors in this research. On top of that, research from CoinGecko indicates that Filecoin has the cheapest storage available for both centralized and decentralized options. Filecoin is already significantly cheaper than any centralized players (Coingecko) One Last update on Filecoin; they launched the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) in March 2023. We believe this has massive potential given how bullish we are on Ethereum. Developers can now port over smart contracts and code almost seamlessly to Filecoin. The FVM is a catalyst that could quickly double or triple network demand. Management claims that the recently launched FVM has the potential to ""10x the networks functionally"" with use cases such as tokenized datasets, data DAOs, smarter storage markets, and Layer 2 bridges. Competitors 1. Arweave Arweave is a bit more private with its financials than Filecoin. Arweave adopts a unique revenue model by charging clients a single, upfront fee for data to be stored in perpetuity. The potential of Arweave seems as high as any of their competitors, but at this point in time there is an elephant in the room: Arweave generated under $1 million in revenue over the past two calendar years, yet trades as a circulating market cap of over $315 million. This is an extremely expensive multiple, especially as revenue is trending downward on an annual basis. Taking a look at the fees paid for storing data, an important metric in studying overall revenue growth, we can see that Arweave has yet to break past the all-time high set back in December 2020. Fees have been on a downtrend since September 2021, coinciding with the overall cryptocurrency bear market. Arweave's next test will be in the next crypto adoption cycle; will Arweave capture enough data storage from existing and new players? Arweave Data Fees (Arweave Explorer) On the adoption front, the size of their data storage network (""The Weave"") has continued to grow (see below). All metrics are showing growth for Arweave, but revenue generation needs to improve to be considered for investment. Arweave network Size (Arweave Explorer) Arweave has one key strength that should be noted: making deals. For instance, the Arweave team struck a deal with Meta (Facebook) as a part of the company's effort to introduce NFTs to Instagram. However, reports indicate Meta won't move forward with its Web3 initiatives until 2024, so the effects of this deal have yet to be seen. Regardless, it bodes well for Arweave's management to make such a deal with a tech-giant. Solana Labs paid out a $15,000 bounty to create the SOLAR Bridge, which went live 2 years ago. This bridge makes Solana the first blockchain to move and store its transaction history on a dedicated storage network. Solana's success now directly benefits Arweave. Arweave also made a deal with Internet Archive, a non-profit dedicated to archiving almost all information on the internet. Arweave stores the torrent files for them to ensure the information is always accessible to the public. If deals like this keep up, Arweave has potential to grow much faster. 2. Storj One of the key revenue streams for Storj is through the use of STORJ as a means of payment for storage and bandwidth on the network. Users pay for storage and bandwidth using STORJ, which creates a demand for the cryptocurrency. Node operators earn STORJ tokens by renting out storage space and bandwidth to users. The more storage space and bandwidth a node operator provides, the more STORJ they can earn. Storj also generates revenue through the use of the platform's enterprise offering. The enterprise offering provides a suite of tools and services to businesses that need to store and manage large amounts of data. This includes features such as dedicated support, compliance reporting, and API access. The enterprise offering generates revenue for Storj through subscription fees paid by businesses that use the service. On a relative basis, Storj is clearly #2 behind Filecoin. Starting with valuations, Storj generated 73% of the revenue that Arweave generated in 2022 while trading at 38% of Arweave's market cap. Further, Storj stores five times as much data as Arweave. If we were an arbitrage trader, we would buy Storj and sell Arweave. Since Storj is mostly enterprise focused, it lacks transparent metrics for potential investors with the exclusion of its revenue. The most recent report from the firm was in Q3 of 2022 for its tokenomics, seen below. STORJ Token Balances and Flows Report: Q3 2022 (STORJ) A significant advantage of crypto investing, typically, is greater transparency into on-chain data. The lack of transparency with Storj data is a concern, but we can clearly see Storj is positioning itself as more of a private firm than a cryptocurrency. Storj has a low valuation given its revenue which makes it more attractive to invest in than Arweave or Siacoin, but not advised at this time. 3. Siacoin Siacoin, the token that supports the Sia decentralized storage platform, has the lowest revenue of the competitors. Making matters worse, they lost some third party user interface providers in the first quarter causing revenue and network usage to plummet. Check out the charts below: Network storage usage: Siacoin Storage Contracts Plummet (Messari) Financial Metrics: Siacoin Key Financials Plummet in Q1 (Messari) Siacoin is to be avoided for the foreseeable future until they show signs of turning these numbers around. Filecoin Price Action Filecoin Price Collapse from All Time Highs (Coinmarketcap) Filecoin achieved its all-time high of $236.84 on April 1st 2021. As of late May 2023, it's right around $4.70. It's down a lot, but close to its all-time low of $2.43 on December 16, 2018. Throughout 2018 and 2019, when the crypto market was lackluster and Filecoin was virtually unheard of, the token traded between $2.50 and $8.10. The network, revenue, and prominence has grown significantly since then, and yet it's still trading in the same price range today. If you feel like you missed out on the 100x it saw in 2021, well, now's your chance to try again. Conclusion, Recommendations, and Risks Siacoin is to be avoided and Arweave looks overvalued. Storj looks like a decent value relative to competitors, but still needs to show significant adoption growth before being able to justify their valuation. Then there is Filecoin. To use an analogy, Filecoin is to the decentralized data storage world what Ethereum is to the layer 1 blockchain world. Filecoin is leaps and bounds beyond their competitors in terms of pricing power, adoption, and network expansion, and they are looking to build a moat around their leadership position with Filecoin Plus. Filecoin Plus is essentially subsidizing growth, driving down storage costs, attracting higher quality clientele, and establishing economies of scale that will make it difficult for competitors to compete. This subsidized growth comes with a key risk: token inflation. Filecoin is following the below token distribution, and while it levels out over time the current Filecoin circulating supply is only a quarter of eventual total supply. An investor should go in with a long-term mindset to withstand the inflation headwind, but then again if crypto experiences another mania then it may be a shorter timeframe to turn a profit. Filecoin Token Supply Schedule (Coinlist) Portfolio Positioning Diversification is important, so we often build crypto portfolios around subsectors of the industry. Some of these include Layer 1s, DeFi, cross-chain, entertainment, and infrastructure. In this case, it's file storage. We recommend having around 5% of your crypto portfolio in file storage, with Filecoin as the primary (or only) token. As always, Bitcoin and Ethereum should make up the vast majority of your portfolio with smaller positions built around them for the upside potential. For those without any Filecoin tokens: now is a good time to start buying.",POSITIVE,FIL,BUSINESS | FIL | ICO | ZRX | AR,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4609381-filecoin-dominating-decentralized-storage-wars?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/13157078.jpeg

42410508,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdXFWY,1685955787,Binance Hands Rising Star Teng Key Role to Replace CEO Zhao at Largest Crypto Exchange,"The appointment of Richard Teng to oversee Binance’s regional markets outside the U.S. has positioned the one-time Abu Dhabi regulator as the most likely successor to Changpeng Zhao, who founded the world’s largest crypto exchange in 2017.  The enhanced role follows a report last month that Zhao, commonly known as CZ, is looking to reduce his ownership of Binance.US, the firm's American arm – a move that's seen as something of an appeasement to U.S. regulators.  Teng's knowledge and experience as a regulator will come to bear in his new role overseeing Asia, Europe, the Middle East and North Africa as the exchange, often targeted by authorities, attempts to draw a line under mounting enforcement actions related to conduct during crypto’s early years. Prior to heading up the Financial Services Regulatory Authority at Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), he was chief regulatory officer of Singapore Exchange (SGX) and spent 13 years with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).  In an interview, Teng sidestepped the idea that he’s being groomed to take the reins from the 46-year-old CEO.  “To speculate on such things would be premature,” Teng, 52, told CoinDesk. “Let me just stress we have a very strong management team in place and many strong leaders looking after different parts of business. I’m just happy to be part of that and to try and support the company’s agenda and aspirations.”  His new role, he pointed out, is not even a promotion, “just expanded responsibility to help [CZ] look at certain things.”  But it’s worth remembering that CZ himself said the firm had a succession plan in place when he hired Teng back in August 2021. Teng initially joined Binance as CEO of the Singapore business, and quickly rose through the ranks during a turbulent period in the digital assets sector.  A former Binance employee, who asked to remain anonymous, told CoinDesk via direct message: “Both senior leadership and regulators have discussed behind closed doors that Richard Teng is the only leader that could step into CZ’s shoes and both continue building the company in his vision while helping bridge the existing gap between the industry and regulators.”  Teng believes Binance is “open and candid about things in the past,” pointing out the firm is still very young. Binance, which will soon celebrate its sixth birthday, started as a technology firm, Teng said, at a point in time when most jurisdictions had no regulations or proper guidance. Today, it has some 750 compliance officers, more than any other exchange, he added.  “If you look at the past 18 to 24 months, the company has pivoted very strongly in terms of the direction of travel on compliance,” Teng said. “But we acknowledge there are past issues. We want to solve all those policy issues in a responsible manner with the respective parties and move on to demonstrate that we are a new organization.”  Meanwhile, crypto continues to evolve, both in its technological development and in terms of tectonic shifts at a level of jurisdictions. In that global context, it could be argued that a clampdown from U.S. regulators will see crypto hubs sprout and flourish elsewhere.  The ambition to set up a dedicated crypto regulatory agency is demonstrated in Dubai, for example, Teng said. Europe is also striding ahead with its Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework, strengthening France's strategy of trying to attract crypto companies.  “If you look at what Paris is doing, it is very conducive for businesses. Not only ourselves, a number of crypto players are trying to use Paris as their base for expansion within Europe,” Teng said.  He also said Binance is “excited” about Hong Kong opening up to crypto trading and offering licenses to firms. Asked if Binance is underway setting up shop in the territory, he said: “That’s an announcement we will make when the time comes.”  CORRECTION (June 5, 10:58 UTC): Corrects spelling of Zhao in first, second paragraphs.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | BNB,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/06/05/binance-hands-rising-star-teng-key-role-to-replace-ceo-zhao-at-largest-crypto-exchange,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b82c4976b4725029511f9ba8ea6033b9f0c55a16-1123x746.webp?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

On May 1, Judge Sean Lane appointed Randall J. Newsome to mediate talks about the contribution Genesis owner Digital Currency Group (DCG) should make to any restructuring plan. DCG is also CoinDesk’s parent company.  30 days later, Genesis sought to expand Newsome’s mandate by a further two weeks. That has prompted a belated response from 3AC, the crypto hedge fund whose dramatic collapse in 2022 heralded the current crypto winter, and which has asserted claims of over $1 billion for transfers made to Genesis prior to bankruptcy.  “[Genesis’] mediation and plan negotiation efforts will be unable to address consensually the claims of all stakeholders and thereby maximize the value of the Debtors’ estates without the participation of the [3AC] Joint Liquidators,” according to the filing made by Russell Crumpler and Christopher Farmer, appointed to represent the 3AC wind-up in the British Virgin Islands.  In March, 3AC reached an interim deal to limit Genesis’ ability to transfer stocks and cryptocurrency while claims are settled, but Crumpler and Farmer now say they haven’t been sufficiently involved in Genesis talks despite being one of the biggest creditors.  The proposal to extend mediation is set to be discussed at a hearing in the Southern District of New York on Monday. It has also been objected to by a range of individual users of the Gemini Earn program, seeking to speed up the return of their funds.  On Jan. 20, the three affiliated companies Genesis Global Holdco LLC, Genesis Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd and Genesis Global Capital LLC filed for bankruptcy. At the time, DCG said it owed Genesis Capital $526 million, due in May 2023, plus $1.1 billion under a promissory note due in June 2032.

42420291,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUevRF,1685953070,UK Lawmakers Call for a Dedicated Government Role to Oversee Crypto Regulation,"A group of U.K. lawmakers is calling on the government to introduce crypto financial services regulations sooner rather than later and to appoint a dedicated official to oversee the process.  In a report published Monday, the Crypto and Digital Assets All Parliamentary Group (APPG) said cryptocurrency is here to stay and needs immediate regulation. The group, which includes lawmakers from different political parties and both houses of parliament, made 53 recommendations for regulating crypto in the country.  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s government recently closed a consultation proposing that the U.K. regulates crypto by bringing it into the scope of existing financial services regulations. CryptoUK, a lobby group affiliated with the APPG, said in its response to the consultation that it wanted the U.K. to have specific crypto regulations in place within a year, a target the government has said it hopes to deliver.  Bills are already being debated in parliament to give lawmakers more powers over the crypto sector as well as help law enforcement agencies seize and freeze crypto.  Currently, crypto companies have to be registered with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) if they want to operate in the country.  ""Given the rapid growth of cryptocurrency and digital assets, the timing of this report is vital to protect consumers whilst ensuring the U.K.’s leadership in this sector can be realized,” Lisa Cameron, chair of the APPG said in a press release on Monday.  The crypto APPG inquiry was launched in August last year. It followed an April announcement by Sunak, then the country’s finance minister, that the government wanted to make the country a crypto hub. As part of the inquiry, the APPG acquired views from members of the crypto industry, regulators and the general public.  In their report, lawmakers laid out recommendations for the government official's role and around the current approaches of regulators like the Bank of England, the Advertising Standards Authority and the FCA.  “Given the broad nature of cryptocurrency and digital asset regulation, Government will need to ensure that it has a joined up and coordinated approach across all governmental departments and agencies that will be impacted by the growth of cryptocurrency, digital assets and blockchain technologies,” the report said.  Many crypto companies have said they had “seen lengthy delays,"" or had their applications for registration rejected by the FCA without clear explanations as to the reasons why, the report said.  Read more: UK Crypto Firms and Regulator Blame Each Other for Industry Exodus  The lawmakers expressed in the report that they had concerns around whether or not regulators had sufficient resources to deliver on its crypto responsibilities and recommended that U.K. regulators have dedicated units for digital assets.  Other recommendations in the report included ensuring stablecoins are backed by high quality assets, ideally with fiat currency, so that they can be used as a form of payment, and that the environmental impact of crypto should be properly looked into by the government.  The APPG report comes after a call from the House of Commons Treasury Committee to regulate crypto as gambling instead of as financial services. The call was met with instant backlash from the local crypto industry. With Monday's report, the APPG aligned with the government's plans.  “We're very supportive of government's position that regulation should move forward in terms of financial services regulation, as has been depicted in the report for three main reasons. One is... I like people to pay tax when they make gains in the U.K. and it's very important that that's harnessed and that can only be achieved under the financial services regulation rather than gambling,” Cameron said at an event on the report at Thames Pavilion on Monday.  The lawmakers called for a new comprehensive tax framework for crypto and for the government to address issues such as U.K. banks limiting interactions with crypto companies, risks to financial stability and crypto-related economic crime.  The APPG also explored ""the potential"" of a central bank digital currency, which the government is consulting on before it makes its decision on whether to issue one.

AngelBlock revealed SOLA-X as its first raise in a blog post last month, tempting investors with the promise of much greater oversight and control over the project’s progress, thanks to its clever “post-raise governance” mechanisms that ensure it must achieve specific goals prior to unlocking capital. On its website, AngelBlock explains that too many investors have been burned in the past due to a lack of transparency and governance on traditional crypto launchpads. Once the funding has been raised, crypto projects are basically left to their own devices, with no checks on their progress or control over how they use the capital they have generated. AngelBlock aims to change this with its post-raise governance, which dictates that projects must establish a series of milestones that must be met, to the satisfaction of its investors, before the next chunk of capital can be accessed. Once the project completes a milestone and files a report, investors will have the opportunity to vote on it and can either approve it and unlock the next pot of funds, or reject it and ask the team to make improvements. This way, AngelBlock says the interest of the project’s founders and investors become better aligned, increasing the prospects of success. To prevent any single investor, or groups of investors, from having a disproportionate influence on these votes, AngelBlock has created options that can define the maximal voting power of a single token holder. The idea with this is that it reinforces democratic decision-making throughout the process. “While giving investors access to exclusive deals yielding high returns and saving time, we want to shape the future of crypto by making the lives of founders and entrepreneurs easier, while protecting investor capital and driving more transparency and benefits to community members of these particular startups,” AngelBlock explains in a blog post. Regarding the first project to launch on AngelBlock, SOLA-X looks like an interesting one. It’s a DeFi protocol that has developed an “advanced liquidity management system”, wherein users can provide a single crypto asset that will be distributed across multiple liquidity pools. Its key promises are to simplify the process of providing liquidity while minimizing the risk of impermanent loss, and to do so it has created an innovative system to manage liquidity in real-time. Through this, it will be able to generate additional yields for investors. The SOLA-X protocol will be fully decentralized, with token holders able to participate in its governance and also stake them for additional rewards. You can read more about SOLA-X on its official website, and on its AngelBlock profile page. AngelBlock has developed a unique staking tiers system that grants priority access and larger ticket sizes to investors based on the amount of $THOL tokens they stake. First priority is given to institutional investors, or those who stake at least 500K $THOL, who will have a 24-hour window in which they get first dibs on the token sale. Next will be angel investors, who stake between 100K and 499K $THOL, with their own 24-hour window, followed by value investors who stake between 20K and 99K $THOL. Once that third 24-hour window closes, standard users (who can stake between 0 and 20K $THOL) will have their own opportunity to snap up whatever tokens remain. AngelBlock’s SOLA-X raise will take place at the end of this month. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

In March, Kwon, along with former Terra executive Han Chang-joon, were arrested in Montenegro for allegedly attempting to travel with falsified documents. Authorities in South Korea had been searching for Kwon after his multi-billion dollar crypto enterprise collapsed in May last year. Since his arrest, both South Korea and the U.S. have requested Kwon's extradition to face criminal charges following his trial in Montenegro.  The basic court in the capital city of Podgorica had already approved a bail request from Kwon's lawyers for the same amount, but it was annulled after prosecution appealed the decision, and a higher court found that the first approval was not based on a sound assessment of the defendants' property based on ""concrete evidence.""  ""The court appreciated the fact that they are persons who are not Montenegrin citizens, which is why it accepted their statements about the value of the property they own, which were supported by concrete evidence,"" the basic court said in Friday's statement.  The case also requires authorities in Belgium to verify the authenticity of travel documents Kwon and Han had in their possession, and the accused could face a prison sentence of up to five years, the court said. Contrary to the prosecution's opinion, the court said a sum of 400,000 euros ""cannot represent an insignificant part of their property.""  The two South Korean nationals are due back in court on June 16. The prosecution has three days to appeal the bail decision.

13155388,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/potential-ripple-ipo-on-the-cards,1685951100,Potential Ripple IPO On The Cards?,"According to Eleanor Terrett, Ripple and its underwriters met Wall Street investors as they look to generate interest in a potential IPO. An IPO On The Cards? Several rumors suggest that Ripple may go the IPO route following the conclusion of its long-running lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission. This became a topic of discussion on Twitter, where it was revealed that the company held a private roadshow event in April, during which company executives met Wall Street investors with the goal of generating interest for an IPO. Eleanor Terrett, Fox Business Journalist, picked up the news, tweeting, “In April, @Ripple hosted a private “road show” (a marketing event where a company and its underwriters meet with potential investors to generate interest in an IPO). I’m told it was attended by just about every reputable institutional investment firm on the Street.” John Deaton, a pro crypto attorney, noted that Ripple could be in a relatively good position depending on the outcome of the summary judgment. Deaton believes that an outright win for Ripple or a mere slap on the wrist could show that ongoing and future sales of XRP are not securities. “If @Ripple wins the SEC lawsuit or gets the functional equivalent of a slap on the wrist, along with a ruling that ongoing and future sales of #XRP are not securities, the lawsuit will prove a blessing in disguise for Ripple.” Long Running Lawsuit Nearing The End Deaton also commented on the potential outcome of the lawsuit, stating that there is a minimal chance (less than 3%) that the Securities and Exchange Commission can score an outright win against Ripple. Deaton has been a vocal supporter of Ripple’s fight against the SEC, and was speaking during the June 3rd episode of the Good Morning Crypto podcast. Apart from his predictions about an outright Ripple victory, he also added that there was a 50% chance that Ripple could emerge victorious through a “splitting the baby” ruling. The last option is a reference to Judge Torress drawing a line in the sand, potentially ruling that XRP was offered as an unregistered security before 2018. However, following the Hinman documents, it could be possible that cryptocurrencies could make the transition from securities to commodities once they are sufficiently decentralized. Deaton added, “I think that XRP itself is going to be deemed not a security and that I think that secondary market sales show comment. Even if [Judge Torres] does rule finding that Ripple violated the law, that doesn’t apply to secondary market sales.” Decision Before the 30th of September Ripple’s executives have been predicting an end to the lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission for a while. Deaton also believes so and predicted that Judge Torres would likely make a final ruling before the 30th of September. He pointed to what he called a “six-month list” that district judges have to file before Congress and added that Judge Torres has never been on the list. The list contains details of all summary judgments that have been pending for longer than six months. Deaton has also given his predictions about the price of XRP following a positive ruling, stating that the token’s value could hover between $2 and $10. He also urged the Ripple community to mark the 13th of June, which is when investors would discover if XRP was the topic of discussion between the SEC staff before the Hinman speech. The Hinman files will be unsealed on the 13th and could dramatically impact the case. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Amsterdam-based fintech Dusk Network rebrands itself as Dusk. The company has matured over the last 5 years, and after focusing on research and development, it is now time to begin disclosing pilots and partnerships, and ramp up business adoption. The old brand was more associated with technological pioneering, while the new visual branding of Dusk has been designed to appeal to the financial industry without reneging the blockchain foundation. After 5 years of research and development, Dusk Network rebrands into ‘Dusk’ Dusk shifts focus to pilots and onboarding partners A more business-oriented approach and international expansion plans for adoption Dusk was created in 2018 with the ambition to use blockchain technology for financial empowerment and economic inclusion. The vision was to create a ‘network’ - hence the name - where institutions would create instruments inexpensively, and users would harvest them directly. Neither vision nor ambition have changed, but it takes a lot of commitment and a mature legislative framework. In the past years, the focus was on research and development; how to provide the technology to realize all this? Groundbreaking research and codes were one of the results, with the launch of a first testnet in 2022. Regulated and Decentralized Finance By dropping ‘Network’ from the name, and adding the tagline ‘Regulated and Decentralized Finance’, the brand represents both its ambition and vision in a clearer way. The transition into a more mature company blends in seamlessly with three key pillars when it comes to realizing their ambitions; bringing real-world assets to people's wallets, compliance, and privacy. These three pillars underscore everything Dusk has been building and is the driving force behind all decisions made. These pillars are key for everyone to have access to real-world financial instruments and to exert complete control over that which they own. Without compliance, mass adoption remains a fantasy. This is why Dusk is such a strong proponent of Regulated Decentralized Finance (RegDeFi). Without compliance with well-made regulations, crypto can never leave the crypto sandbox. “Dusk Network was founded in 2018 and in that time we’ve worked tirelessly to create the technology to unite the worlds of crypto and real-world assets and to bring financial freedom and inclusion to everyone. With the rebranding of Dusk, it feels like we’re entering a new era, moving forward as a scale-up and can finally trial our tech stack with the onboarding of pilots. Besides that, we focus on new partnerships and business development”. - says Emanuele Francioni, founder & CEO at Dusk. Onboarding partnerships and embarking pilots During an exclusive network and relationship dinner, a sneak peek of the new brand was revealed. It was part of an engaging moment of connection with partners, prospects and game-changers in the industry. During the event, Emanuele Francioni, founder and CEO of Dusk elaborated on recent business developments. Dusk made a strategic investment in the London-based startup OutDID, as part of the development of self-sovereign identity and to tie in with its own KYC products, Citadel and Shelter. All these will contribute to smarter use of and access to data, tying back to the three main pillars of Dusk. A partnership with NPEX, the licensed MTF exchange, to participate in the European Union Distributed Ledger Technology Regime (DLTR). Together with a top-tier financial institution, the aim is to make the first MTF for asset tokenization under this exemption. Also new upcoming partnerships with Mavryk (tokenized real estate), Cosimo X (already an investor), and IPwe (intellectual property-backed debt instruments) were mentioned. The new brand identity accelerates the more mature direction of the company, with a cadence of business development announcements coming up in the next months.

In recent weeks, the coin has exhibited minimal volatility, leaving many investors wondering about its future direction. However, despite the apparent inactivity, various indicators hint at the possibility of a substantial price movement in the near future. As the path ahead for SHIB seems somewhat restricted, it raises the question of where the coin may head next and what potential opportunities or hurdles lie ahead. Related Reading: Bedrock Upgrade: How Optimism Game-Changer Could Impact OP Price Shiba Inu (SHIB) Liquidity Woes During the peak of the 2021 bull market, Shiba Inu (SHIB) emerged as a prominent player, spearheading price rallies that garnered significant attention. As a result, ShibaSwap, the decentralized exchange associated with SHIB, experienced a surge in Total Value Locked (TVL), reaching an impressive $1.75 billion. However, the previously soaring TVL has taken a massive hit, plummeting to just $25.16 million, according to DefiLlama. At first glance, this dramatic decline in TVL may raise concerns about a potential liquidity crisis. Yet, a closer examination suggests that this situation may be temporary rather than a long-term predicament. Recent data indicates a notable increase in SHIB purchases across various time intervals, and a closer look at wallet data reveals a mixed picture, with some ranges displaying an increase in holdings while others demonstrate a decrease. SHIB total market cap currently at $5.1 billion on the daily chart: TradingView.com SHIB Investors Show Confidence in Long-Term Potential Upon analyzing on-chain data, Santiment’s chart reveals a notable pattern among SHIB token holders. Specifically, investors with SHIB holdings ranging from 1 to 1,000,000 tokens have demonstrated a consistent increase in their balances. This upward trend suggests that a considerable segment of the retail cohort holds a certain degree of belief in the long-term performance of this meme-inspired cryptocurrency.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: As Asia's trading day begins with a minor rise in Bitcoin and dip in Ether, experts predict a pre-FOMC market correction, underlining digital assets' resilience amid US regulatory and debt challenges.  Insights: The decline in the bitcoin options put/call ratio suggests that crypto investors are less worried than they were in June as U.S. lawmakers clashed over raising the country's debt ceiling.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,185 +3.1 ▲ 0.3% Bitcoin (BTC) $27,109 +39.7 ▲ 0.1% Ethereum (ETH) $1,890 −2.9 ▼ 0.2% S&P 500  4,282.37 +61.4 ▲ 1.5% Gold  $1,965 +12.5 ▲ 0.6% Nikkei 225  31,524.22 +376.2 ▲ 1.2% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,185 +3.1 ▲ 0.3% Bitcoin (BTC) $27,109 +39.7 ▲ 0.1% Ethereum (ETH) $1,890 −2.9 ▼ 0.2% S&P 500 4,282.37 +61.4 ▲ 1.5% Gold $1,965 +12.5 ▲ 0.6% Nikkei 225 31,524.22 +376.2 ▲ 1.2% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  Bitcoin and Ether Are Still Thriving  As Asia begins its trading day, bitcoin is up 0.1% to $27,109, while Ether is down slightly to $1,890.  BitBull Capital’s Joe DiPasquale says the theme this week will be correction and consolidation before the next FOMC meeting minutes are released on June 14.  “We had been expecting a correction and consolidation between $25K and $27K levels, and that’s what we have been witnessing over the last month,” he told CoinDesk in a note. “While we haven’t had a major test of $30K, another attempt of the key resistance level would not be surprising.”  Mark Connors, head of research for digital asset manager 3iQ, points out that it's impressive that the digital asset market is still thriving despite the hostile regulatory environment in the U.S. This is all thanks to a market that continues to be concerned about the unprecedented debt issuance within the U.S.  “With equity and debt markets wondering how much the U.S. Treasury's renewed debt issuance will impact liquidity and thereby market prices, digital assets are taking matters into their own hands,” he wrote to CoinDesk.  Connors writes that despite 2023's focus on Bitcoin's increased dominance and surging fees amid a challenging U.S regulatory environment, Ethereum's post-merge performance, including an unexpected non-impact of staking 'unlock,' increased staking demand, and realized deflationary promise with over 250k ETH 'burned,' is garnering market attention.  “So while the fate of the $500 trillion equity and debt markets hinges on the ability of central banks and treasury departments to provide much-needed liquidity, the bellwether digital assets bitcoin and ether are taking care of business, and the market is responding – even if institutions and regulators are not,” he told CoinDesk.

The bitcoin options put/call ratio across exchanges is currently 0.47, down from 1.34 to begin in June.  The buyer of a put has purchased the right to sell the asset at a specified price, while the buyer of a call is purchasing the right to buy the asset. The relationship between the two can indicate investor sentiment, particularly when rising or falling to extreme levels  The volume of purchased puts and calls is measured over the most recent 24 hours, with levels above one signaling bearishness, and levels below one implying the opposite.  The recent decline indicates that fewer traders are looking to purchase downside protection against future price declines. The spike in protection toward the end of the prior month, was likely tied to concerns about the debt deal recently agreed to by Democrats and Republicans.
