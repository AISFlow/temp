42426356,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJMxbh,1432678429,Case Against Controversial Student Bitcoin Project Comes to Close,"The New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs has settled with the developers behind Tidbit, a student hackathon project that experimented with bitcoin mining as an alternative to online advertising.  Under the terms of the settlement, Tidbit's developers have agreed not to access New Jersey computers unlawfully for a period of two years. Should the developers be found in violation of the provision, a release from the government said they would be assessed a $25,000 penalty.  The resolution marks the end of a controversial court case that began when MIT student Jeremy Rubin received a subpoena in December 2013. At issue was the question of whether Tidbit was ever operational enough to be in violation of the law.  New Jersey officials maintain that their investigation found that Tidbit accessed computers owned by individuals without their consent. The non-profit Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), which represented Rubin, says that this assertion is false.  EFF senior staff attorney Hanni Fakhoury told CoinDesk:  ''As the settlement agreement makes clear, the students have not admitted to any wrongdoing. Indeed, as the court presiding over the case found, there was no 'inherently improper or malicious intent or design' behind Tidbit.""  The EFF maintains the code was operational for ""two days"", and that no bitcoins were mined when the program was live. New Jersey continues to allege that the developers' activities constitute violations of the state's Computer Related Offenses Act and Consumer Fraud Act.  ""Innovations that affect consumers must operate in compliance with the law,"" Attorney General John Hoffman said in a statement. ""No website should tap into a person’s computer processing power without clearly notifying the person and giving them the chance to opt out.”  No ill intent  Hoffman acknowledged that New Jersey does not believe Tidbit was created for the purpose of invading user privacy. However, he inferred that New Jersey's actions were justified, citing the state's need to protect the privacy interests of its citizens.  ""This potentially invasive software raised significant questions about user privacy and the ability to gain access to and potentially damage privately owned computers without the owners’ knowledge and consent,"" Hoffman continued.  According to the state, Tidbit's code was found to to be active on three websites that were registered and located in New Jersey.  Such findings conflict with the opinions of the EFF, which maintains the code was not operable and that Tidbit's developers never actually profited from program.  Government overreach  In interview, Fakhoury expressed his belief that the government ""overreached"" in its prosecution of the Tidbit developers. While no monetary penalties were assessed, Fakhoury still expressed a fear that the action would deter innovation within the digital currency space in the future.  ""We worry this is going to send a message that will chill people from engaging in research and innovative projects,"" he said.  Fakhoury suggested that he doesn't believe the resolution means a similar program to Tidbit couldn't be lawfully developed. However, he indicated that the students involved in the project have since had to deal with the negative consequences of the protracted ordeal.  The case, according to Fakhoury, put a strain on the friendships of those involved and collapsed negotiations between the developers and venture capital firms that might have otherwise invested in the project.  ""I think the most unfortunate about the whole thing is that it stunted their ability to develop it further,"" Fakhoury continued, concluding:  ""I think there's an interesting way for a type of project like this to go forward and maybe one day it will.""

42426366,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJMxth,1432674173,Official 'Life on Bitcoin' Documentary Trailer Released,"Nearly two years after initial filming began, the official trailer for the documentary Life on Bitcoin has been released.  Starring Beccy and Austin Craig, the long-awaited film follows the newlyweds as they embark on a 100-day quest to pay for all their needs with bitcoin. The Craigs became a media sensation in 2013 for their exploits, garnering headlines and eventually raising $70,000 on Kickstarter to promote the film.  The preview opens with a montage of scenes from the couple's travels interspersed with news clips of anchors analyzing the technology. Elsewhere, Fusion senior editor Kashmir Hill makes an appearance to build suspense for the narrative.  Hill states:  ""When I first heard that Austin and Beccy were going to live on bitcoin for three months, I was pretty worried for them.""  Also included are interviews with bitcoin luminaries such as Jeffrey Tucker that aim to perhaps exaggerate the government's supposedly hostile stance toward digital currencies, and scenes that showcase the couple persuading merchants to accept bitcoin.  The Craigs indicated that they hope to travel in support of film screenings to be held this summer.  For more on the trials and tribulations of the Life on Bitcoin journey, revisit our 2013 interview.

42426360,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJMxfh,1432669568,Bitcoin Center Opens in Brazil's Capital City,"BitcoinToYou has opened its newest franchise location in Brasília, the capital city of Brazil.  The announcement marks the fourth physical location to open under the Brazil-based bitcoin and litecoin brokerage's brand in the last year.  BitcoinToYou  aspires to launch bitcoin centers across Brazil that can serve as meeting places for enthusiasts in the same way as the New York-based Bitcoin Center NYC.  In a blog post, BitcoinToYou CEO Andre Horta described the launch event as one compromised of IT professionals, civil servants and local businesspeople. Further, he used the occasion to highlight what he believes is the importance of physical locations that promote interest in bitcoin as a technology.  Horta wrote:  ""We need to go beyond the obvious and see the important role of having physical presence in major cities of the country, thus promoting bitcoin, breaking barriers and showing that bitcoin is here to stay even to those who are skeptical.""  BitcoinToYou charges customers a percentage fee for completed trades on its exchange, and offers a monthly membership for more extensive services available at its locations.  The first BitcoinToYou location launched in Curitiba in June of 2014. At the time, the company suggested it had plans to establish presences in major cities such as São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, Brasília and Florianopolis.

42426359,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJMxjh,1432667153,Accenture: UK Government Should Regulate Bitcoin Wallets,"The UK government should apply the same regulation and identification requirements to bitcoin wallets as it does to bank accounts, Accenture has suggested.  Documents obtained by CoinDesk through a Freedom of Information request show the multinational management consulting company's response to the Treasury’s call for information on digital currencies.  Dated December 2014, the company takes a very positive stance on cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, highlighting their potential.  Accenture states:  “Digital currencies are at an early stage of development and usage, but they are here to stay and the technology has the potential to reinvent many aspects of financial services.”  However, the document also recognises the risks associated with these currencies, including price volatility, lack of consumer protection and the potential loss of funds, for example by forgetting a private key, or through a fraudster gaining access.  Suggested regulation  Accenture believes bitcoin’s biggest problem currently is its association with, and use in, money laundering. It claims the identification requirements applied to bank accounts should also be applied to bitcoin wallets.  “In the same way that governments require identifiable bank accounts (through named accounts and know-your-customer checks), a requirement for named, identifiable digital currency wallets would be a core component of a safe, legitimate digital currency economy,” the document reads.  It goes on to suggest a centralised authority may need to be established to “supervise and monitor the use of digital currency wallets”.  Accenture stresses repeatedly in the document that regulation should be limited to digital currency wallets, rather than applied to digital currencies more broadly.  Any regulation that is created, needs to be “reasonable and proportionate”, with clear guidance on the rules and responsibilities for the participants of digital currency wallet schemes.  The submission goes on to say:  “Heavy regulation (or application of historical frameworks) could stifle innovation – to avoid this, an agile regulatory regime should be set up to be flexible and develop specifically for digital currencies as the digital currency economy grows.”  Limited actions  In the 16-page document, Accenture suggests the government take limited actions, which could include:  Regulating so that digital currency wallets can be identified uniquely and recognised eg through KYC checks  Recognising and authorising organisations (Authorised Digital Currency Wallet Institutions – eg banks) that can provide identity checks and verification services to enable identifiable digital currency wallets  Providing a framework of clear rules and responsibilities for the participants of the digital currency wallet market on how to place controls on the digital currency wallets to help prevent financial crimes (AML and sanctions).  The document claims that the above measures would “catalyse the development of the safe, legitimate digital currency economy”.  The black economy  The submission notes that, under the proposal, bitcoin users would still be able to open and operate anonymous digital currency wallets, but these would fall outside of the “legitimate economy” and reside in the “black economy”.  Because the blockchain acts as a ledger, recording all bitcoin transactions, even those that occur in the black economy will be noted.  “Not only will this help with law enforcement and forensic analysis of anonymous transactions, it will be difficult (if not impossible) for digital currency used in the digital currency black economy to be laundered undetected back into the legitimate digital currency economy,” Accenture said.  Authorised Institutions  Accenture proposes the creation of an Authorised Digital Currency Wallet Institutions list, similar to the list of Authorised Payment Institutions.  These institutions would be authorised and regulated by a central authority, such as the FCA and they would be required to:  Issue digital currency wallets and identify the digital currency wallet owner through KYC checks  Maintain a compliance status of each digital currency wallet  Monitor digital currency wallet usage to check payments are between other identifiable digital currency wallets  Monitor transactions for adherence to sanctions lists  Be able to freeze digital currency wallets where they are being used for suspicious activity.  Encouraging bank participation  Accenture believes that, without Government intervention, UK banks are not likely to provide digital currency businesses with support, which will further hamper payments innovation and drive cryptocurrency companies abroad.  The document claims banks are “very supportive” of fintech startups, but are just reluctant to be exposed to fines from UK and international regulators for AML and sanctions breaches. It adds:  “The potential upside from taking on startups as customers with possible AML exposures pales into insignificance compared to the fines they risk.”  Experimenting with blockchain tech  In an interview with CoinDesk, an Accenture spokesperson explained why the company had decided to participate in the government’s call for information.  She said cryptocurrencies are important for the firm’s financial services clients, so Accenture has developed points of view on this area. The spokesperson added:  “We are currently experimenting with blockchain technologies in our Technology Labs to test use cases relevant to our clients’ interests. The consultation was an opportunity to share our thought leadership with the government and contribute to the debate.”  Last week, CoinDesk revealed Citi’s response to the call for information, which suggested the UK government should create its own digital currency.

42378178,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7MdJt,1432651797,Xapo Adds Former Visa and Citibank Execs to Board of Advisors,"Bitcoin services provider Xapo has appointed a number of notable businessmen to its recently inaugurated board of advisors, including founder of Visa, Dee Hock.  Joining Hock on the Xapo board are John Reed, the former chairman and CEO of Citibank; and Lawrence H. Summers, Secretary of Treasury under Bill Clinton's administration.  The newly appointed board members praised digital currency's potential, with Hock claiming ""bitcoin represents not only the future of payments but also the future of governance"".  ""We live in the 21st century but are still using command and control organisational structures from the 16th century. Bitcoin is one of the best examples of how a decentralised, peer-to-peer organisation can solve problems that these dated organisations cannot [...] it presents incredible opportunities for new levels of efficiency and transparency in financial transactions,"" he added.  A real opportunity  Reed said bitcoin represented a ""real opportunity"" for changing the existing financial structure, which he claims has remained largely untouched by the digital revolution.  Reed, who described bitcoin as ""the best iteration of a universal ledger"", concluded:  ""The mere fact that there will never be more than 21 million bitcoins and that each bitcoin can be divided into 100 million units makes it a significant improvement on any historical form of currency.""  Summers spoke about the digital currency's long-term potential, noting that real-time bitcoin transactions could eventually mean people would be able to send digital currency as easily as they currently send a text message.  The announcement follows Xapo's relocation of its headquarters to Switzerland. Speaking to CoinDesk, Wences Casares, Xapo's CEO cited the country's history of neutrality as a decisive factor behind the move.  Talent outreach  Xapo is not the only crypto startup recruiting talent from the White House. In January this year, Ripple Labs named Gene Sperling, an economic advisor to former President Bill Clinton and current President Barack Obama, to its board of directors.  A couple of months later, in March, the San Francisco-based startup behind the digital payment network Ripple, appointed Anja Manuel, a former US Department official as an advisor.  Notable Wall Street executives have also entered the crypto space in recent months. Ex JP Morgan Chase & Co executive Blythe Masters swapped Wall Street for Digital Asset Holdings LLC – which is believed to operate a decentralised wholesale settlement system in a bid to overhaul the traditional finance model – as chief executive.

42378181,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7MdNf,1432643325,EBA Chairman: Banks Must Understand Blockchain Tech,"Banks need to understand blockchain technology and explore its long-term benefits, according to the head of group payments and operations at the Bank of Ireland and chairman of the European Banking Association (EBA) working group.  Speaking at EBA 2015, a networking and research event which gathers European payment professionals, Vincent Brennan told Finextra:  ""We see [the blockchain] as a technology that while relatively novel and new is one that if you look into two years, five years or 10 years, would be very important for banks and now is the time to start understanding it and looking at what its opportunities could be.""  During the interview, Brennan outlined the advantages of a decentralised ledger such as the blockchain in terms of foreign exchange remittances, faster payments and collateral management.  Brennan's statement follows the publication of the EBA's Crypto technologies, a major IT innovation and catalyst for change report, which highlighted the blockchain's potential to improve banking, reduce costs and improve product offerings.  Notably, the EBA's report, released earlier this month, largely dismissed digital currencies such as bitcoin, but acknowledged its application was essential to gain a wider understanding of crypto technology.
