42433148,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO3QPh,1605652161,Crypto-Friendly Brooks Gets Nod to Serve 5-Year Term Leading Bank Regulator,"Outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump has nominated Acting Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brookshttps://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/president-donald-j-trump-announces-intent-nominate-appoint-following-individuals-key-administration-posts-111720/, an advocate for crypto-friendly reforms, to lead the national bank regulator on a more official basis.    Brooks, a former bank executive who joined the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in March after a stint as general counsel at Coinbase, has headed the federal agency on an acting basis since May. One of his first actions at the agency was to propose a federal licensing regime for fintech startups, which would spare them from obtaining state-by-state money transmitter licenses that all crypto exchanges currently need to do business.      Since being named Acting Comptroller by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Brooks has made a number of moves to integrate crypto with the historically gun-shy banking sector. In July, his office published a letter telling nationally regulated banks they could offer crypto custody services, while announcing in September that these same banks can provide services to stablecoin issuers.      Brooks has been serving as Acting Comptroller after his predecessor, Joseph Otting, announced his decision to step down in early May. The U.S. Senate Banking Committee oversees the OCC and will likely hold a confirmation hearing before the entire Senate votes to confirm or reject Brooks’ nomination.      This means that timing could be a deciding factor. Trump lost November’s election to Democratic challenger Joe Biden, meaning Biden can nominate someone else to the position if Brooks isn’t confirmed before Jan. 20, 2021.      It’s unclear whether the Democratic senators on the committee would vote for Brooks. He has been criticized by some congressional Democrats for his focus on crypto, with several members of the House Financial Services Committee asking him a series of questions about his work on crypto and arguing he should spend more time addressing financial inclusion and minority banking issues, especially given the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.      In addition, the Democrats in the Senate may wish to let President-elect Biden name his own choice to the OCC to serve a five-year term, rather than let Trump confirm another regulator.      Brooks’ nomination comes on the same day a vote to confirm Federal Reserve Board of Governors nominee Judy Shelton failed. The former Trump adviser was a controversial pick, with three Republican senators saying they would vote against her, citing concerns about her views on the gold standard and the independence of the Fed board. A new vote is expected to occur at a later date.      In a statement, Brooks said it was ""a great honor"" to be nominated, adding:    It is a great honor to have President Donald J. Trump announce his intent to nominate me to serve our nation as the 32nd Comptroller of the Currency.The mission of the Comptroller of the Currency benefits each American by ensuring our national banks and federal savings associations operate in a safe, sound and fair manner. The OCC aims to promote fair access to capital and credit for the hundreds of millions of customers the federal banking system serves. We strive to make sure banks remain capable of providing the financial services that businesses and communities depend on to conduct their important activities each day. The more than 3,500 men and women of the OCC tirelessly work to keep the U.S. banking system the most respected in the world and a powerful source of strength for our economy and the nation.As Acting Comptroller of the Currency, I am proud to contribute to this 157-year-old mission. If confirmed, I will work ceaselessly to ensure the agency continues to fulfill its critical mission and the men and women of this agency have the resources, training, and leadership they need to succeed in their duties.  A tall order    The hurdles to confirmation appear to be high for Brooks.      For starters, the Senate is in a lame-duck session, the Banking Committee would need to schedule a hearing and hold a vote, and Congress is about to go on its Thanksgiving break and won't return until December.      While the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett showed the Senate majority can push something through if it is committed, ""Republicans have to really want it,"" said a longtime analyst of financial policymaking, noting that Shelton's nomination failed to advance.      Further, even if Brooks were to be confirmed, incoming President Biden could take the unusual but statutorily permitted step of firing the comptroller, which members of his party would likely encourage if not insist upon. All he would be required to do is notify the Senate of the rationale for the firing.      Brooks' nomination ""is a last-minute move to install someone at the OCC for five years,"" said the Washington analyst, who requested anonymity because his employer does not want to be caught up in controversy. ""The Democrats are likely to view it as a shady trick.""      UPDATE (Nov. 17, 23:20): Added background on hurdles facing nomination.      CORRECTION (Nov. 17, 23:40): A previous version of this article stated Sen.-elect Mark Kelly of Arizona would replace Martha McSally on the Senate Banking Committee.

42433175,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO3Qxh,1605648995,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Breaks $17.8K, Outperforming Ether in November So Far","Spot volumes and futures open interest pushed bitcoin’s price up Tuesday, beating ether’s performance so far this month.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $17,688 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 5.3% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $16,560-$17,862  BTC above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s bull mode continued Tuesday after opening the week hitting highs not seen since early 2018. The world’s oldest cryptocurrency traded as high as $17,862 as of press time, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      Read More: Bitcoin Slices Through $17,000 as Market Cap Nears All-Time High      The last time bitcoin was at this level was back on Dec. 19, 2017, a volatile day that saw the price per 1 BTC range between $16,862 and $18,984.      Promising news Monday of a second possible coronavirus vaccine lifted most markets, and bitcoin simply continued its run with very positive trading fundamentals, noted Jason Lau, chief operating officer for San Francisco-based exchange OKCoin. “Bitcoin had already gained Monday prior to the vaccine news, reflecting its recent strength,” said Lau. “This rally versus 2017 is different because it is more institutional-driven.”      Bitcoin futures open interest on institutional investor venue CME is at a record high Tuesday, hitting $976 million, according to data aggregator Skew.      “Bitcoin has continued to power on, but behind the raging bull there is a growing level of sophistication and capital allocation techniques,” said Denis Vinokourov, head of research for crypto brokerage Bequant.      Read More: Traders Brace for Major Volatility as Bitcoin Price Nears Record Highs      “Bitcoin has gone parabolic, with traders piling in from all sides – retail, institutional, Main Street and Wall Street,” said Guy Hirsch, U.S. managing director for multi-asset brokerage eToro. “FOMO is back and it feels like 2017 again, only this time the market is backed by real fundamentals rather than the [initial coin offering] mania of three years ago.”      Spot volumes on major USD/BTC exchanges were booming Tuesday, at over $1.1 billion daily volume as of press time and much higher than the $413 million daily average the past month.      Aside from major trading platforms that exchange dollars for bitcoin, Hirsch also noted that many retail investors now have another venue in the form of PayPal (PYPL), which opened crypto purchases up to $20,000 for all U.S. residents this past week and could increase the potential for the price to hit new records.      “Given the increased exposure to mom and pop investors through platforms like PayPal, we may be at a crescendo, with bitcoin surging into entirely new territory as it potentially pushes past the all-time high,” said Hirsch.      Another factor to consider: The slumping value of the U.S. dollar. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.25% Tuesday and continues to be in the doldrums versus a basket of other fiat currencies.      “Another big variable is the devaluing of the U.S. dollar,” noted Ilia Maksimenka, chief executive officer of decentralized finance startup PlasmaPay. “This causes people to be less confident in the dollar, so people rely on other investment vehicles.”    Ether lagging bitcoin in November    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Tuesday trading around $482 and climbing 4.5% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Read More: As DeFi Grows, Investors Look to Polkadot to Be the Next Ethereum      Bitcoin’s price performance is actually beating ether in November as of press time, up 28% versus 24%.      However, ether is still killing it in 2020, up 270% versus bitcoin’s 146% year-to-date gain.      Brian Mosoff, chief executive officer of investment firm Ether Capital, said that in this bull run bitcoin has name recognition that ether doesn’t – at least not yet. “It's easy to understand why bitcoin is leading the month in the digital asset space. To traditional investors it has by far the biggest brand,” Mosoff told CoinDesk. “That said, I believe both bitcoin and ether will perform well in the upcoming months and years. Ethereum's programmable flexibility is technically an order of magnitude improvement over [the Bitcoin blockchain] and has by far the largest and most diverse group of developers.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly green Tuesday. Notable winners as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET):    ethereum classic (ETC) + 9.6%  cardano (ADA) + 6%  xrp (XRP) + 6%    One notable loser:    orchid (OXT) - 0.70%    Equities:    The Nikkei 225 ended the day in the green 0.42%, boosted by gains in Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which rose 7% Tuesday.

Open interest, or the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, on CME Group's bitcoin futures market reached its highest level since mid-August as iconic players in traditional markets, like Stanley Druckenmiller and Bill Miller, expressed optimistic opinions about bitcoin.  The previous record high of $948 million came shortly after another famed investor, Paul Tudor Jones, said he owns bitcoin and planned to take positions in bitcoin futures.  So far in 2020, bitcoin has rallied 144%, according to Messari market data.  Expanding on the growth craze in CME's bitcoin market, a spokesperson for the firm told CoinDesk, ""The number of large open interest holders (LOIH) is once again at a record 102 holders and we are averaging 101 holders so far in November.""  CME's surge in bitcoin futures positions also comes as incumbent, crypto-only exchanges including BitMEX and Huobi face ongoing regulatory challenges and flat or declining open interest through Q3 and Q4.  CME's growth relative to other exchanges is ""indicative of institutional investors wanting exposure to bitcoin,"" said Phillip Gradwell, chief economist for the blockchain surveillance software firm Chainalysis, in an email to CoinDesk.

42433137,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO3Mhh,1605636835,This $29B Asset Advisory Is Giving Wealth Managers and Clients a Bitcoin On-Ramp,"Somewhere between the Coinbase hawk and the institutional bitcoin whale lies a growing class of high-end retail investors pushing their money managers to join the bull run.      Their calls grew loud enough for Mariner Wealth Advisors to take action. Now, the registered investment advisory (RIA) whose network of independent financial advisors (FA) manage $29 billion, is giving its 23,000 clients a way to jump in.      On Tuesday, Mariner Wealth announced its 346 FAs will soon have access to the bitcoin markets through a separately managed account (SMA) set up by crypto firm Eaglebrook Advisors. The bitcoin SMA will let Mariner FAs trade bitcoin, custody it and calculate tax burdens on their clients' behalf when fully rolled out later this year.      ""Clients have been asking questions as bitcoin has grown and gained popularity. Late last year, we decided we should begin looking at potential solutions,"" said Mariner Wealth CEO Marty Bicknell.      Eaglebrook CEO Christopher King told CoinDesk the partnership is a first step in tapping a huge potential class of investors worth between $5 million and $10 million that he said did not participate in the record-setting bull run of 2017. These high-end retail types route their trades on stocks, bonds and funds through FAs, but more often than not, the traditional firms behind those FAs lacked the infrastructure to execute on bitcoin, King said.      Read more: This Crypto Custody Breakthrough Will Bring Banks Closer to Digital Assets      ""No one was building for the independent registered investment advisor market that I know manages trillions of dollars,"" he said. (TD Ameritrade estimates that RIAs manage more than $4.7 trillion in client assets).      King created an SMA for FAs to enter the bitcoin markets, buy, hold, custody, sell and calculate tax burdens just as they do for other asset classes. He spent 12 months integrating the SMA with Mariner Wealth's existing portfolio reporting systems. The idea was to make bitcoin allocations a seamless part of FAs' wealth management strategy, he said.      ""It's really important for including bitcoin in [clients'] wealth plan and estate plan, as well as allowing advisers to bill on the assets, the same way they would for an Apple stock or Tesla stock or Amazon,"" he said.      Eaglebrook is offering bitcoin custody services through Gemini Trust Company at launch. As of Tuesday, Mariner is Eaglebrook SMA's only customer.

42433132,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO3Mdh,1605636363,Traders Brace for Major Volatility as Bitcoin Price Nears Record Highs,"Bitcoin traders expect a significant increase in volatility as the leading cryptocurrency continues to recoup nearly all its losses since topping out just below $20,000 in late 2017. Whether the volatility comes from increased buying or selling is a matter of disagreement.      Through bitcoin’s current rally, volatility has remained low. Since late August, 30-day volatility has remained below 0.03 and 180-day volatility has steadily decreased from 0.05, according to data from Coin Metrics.      Over the same period, bitcoin has gained nearly 80% after a brief dip to $10,000 at the beginning of September.      As bitcoin closes in on the much-anticipated all-time-high mark, some responsive selling should be expected, said Mike McGlone, senior commodity strategist for Bloomberg Intelligence, in an email to CoinDesk.      But a “wave of institutional flows appears to be just getting started and offsetting the relative youth of bitcoin's past, keeping its upward trajectory intact,” McGlone added. Any selling at record highs should only “act as a speed bump” to bitcoin’s long-term trajectory, he said.      Regardless of which side of the market investors choose to pile onto, “elevated” volatility in the very near future seems likely, according to Sam Trabucco, quantitative trader at Alameda Research.      Some selling could come from investors looking to realize some paper gains after reaching a historic price level as the number of bitcoin addresses in profit surpassed 98% Monday, according to Glassnode. Not since early December 2017 were there this many addresses in profit on paper.      To Joseph Todaro, partner at Greymatter Capital, reaching a new all-time high will probably trigger significant selling as the market is likely to repeat its reaction to previous all-time highs given that “traders lean heavily on historical price action,” he told CoinDesk in an email.      In 2016, for example, bitcoin’s approach to the then-all-time high was “met with significant sell-side pressure,” Todaro explained. He expects the same response as bitcoin nears $20,000, followed by consolidation and then renewed upward momentum.      The previous all-time high represents a significant inflection point in mainstream interest for bitcoin, said Kyle Davies, co-founder of Three Arrows Capital, in a direct message with CoinDesk. At that point, he expects mainstream interest to accelerate.      But mainstream attention should trigger significant upside volatility, not downward, according to Davies. “We will not see resistance. We will see price discovery,” he said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Zack Voell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/17/traders-brace-for-major-volatility-as-bitcoin-price-nears-record-highs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/69c7bfb83a74194230e53c017d874eccf102cc8d-877x603.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Anchorage has applied with the OCC for a national bank charter. Community members have proposed a vote to reinstate Unsiwap’s liquidity mining program.    Top shelf    15% below Bitcoin traded above $17,000 Tuesday at 12:00 UTC for the first time since Jan. 7, 2018, according to the CoinDesk 20 price index. This move puts the cryptocurrency 15% below its all-time high of $20,000 set in December 2017, and up nearly 130% on the year. The rise also pushes bitcoin’s total market capitalization to over $315 billion, just short of its $335 billion record. Despite BTC’s strong performance, exchange trading volumes remain relatively unimpressive. Take Coinbase’s BTC/USD trading pair for instance, which has seen flat monthly volumes since June.      Origin unknown Stablecoin project Origin Dollar (OUSD) lost nearly $7 million worth of crypto in the latest sophisticated exploit of a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol. At 00:47 UTC Tuesday, an unknown attacker utilized a flash loan and flaws in OUSD contracts to initiate what is known as a “rebase,” according to the protocol’s team. The attack artificially inflated the supply of OUSD tokens within the protocol before swapping the newly printed tokens on SushiSwap and Uniswap for USDT. The team has since disabled deposits and the price of the project’s native token was down 85% on the news.      Crypto-native bank Crypto custodian Anchorage is looking to convert a part of its business into a nationally chartered bank. In a notice dated Nov. 9, Anchorage applied to the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for a national charter to become, if approved, the first crypto-native bank regulated at the federal level. Nathan McCauley, Anchorage’s co-founder and CEO, told CoinDesk the company is looking to “serve the emerging needs of large banks looking to integrate crypto” with the license, which would give Anchorage the clear authority to act as a “qualified custodian” for institutional investors in all 50 states.      Galaxy’s fund Crypto merchant bank Galaxy Digital will launch a bitcoin fund in Canada, called the CI Galaxy Bitcoin Fund. According to a Monday press release, the fund’s preliminary prospectus has been approved by the nation’s securities regulator for a public offering. Designed in collaboration with CI Global Asset Management, the “closed-end” investment fund will invest directly in BTC and be targeted towards institutional investors. Last week, Galaxy disclosed it had acquired two crypto businesses in a bid to become the ""go-to"" firm for such investors.      Chump change? Providing insight into a proposed rule change that would lower the threshold to report crypto transactions to the international regulatory body, a Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) policy specialist said criminals are conducting cross-border payments using smaller amounts of cryptocurrency. Last month, authorities submitted a proposal to amend the “Travel Rule” requiring banks and digital asset service providers to collect and store information related to crypto or fiat transfers of at least $250 that go outside the U.S. (down from $3,000). That said, FinCEN is seeking comment “from the industry as we are examining all the different technologies and business models operating in this space, whether it’s decentralized exchanges or related applications,” the agency expert said.

(CoinDesk)  Market intel    Outshining gold Bitcoin is outshining gold by a significant margin. While the top cryptocurrency by market value has risen 22% to cross $17,000 this month, the precious metal is up just 0.5% at the current price of $1,890 per ounce.      'Digital silver' flips Litecoin jumped to nine-month highs early on Tuesday, replacing bitcoin cash as the seventh-largest cryptocurrency by market value. The cryptocurrency, sometimes called “digital silver,” rose approximately 10% to $75.77 during the Asian trading hours, a level last seen on Feb. 24, according to the CoinDesk 20. With the jump, Litecoin now has a market capitalization of $4.90 billion, higher than bitcoin cash – which underwent a hard fork on Sunday – at $4.67 billion.    At stake    Governance vote Uniswap, the decentralized market maker at the center of this year’s DeFi boom, has ended its liquidity mining subsidy.      Instituted in September in a bid to regain market share from the upstart protocol SushiSwap, Uniswap allocated approximately 20 million UNI to four mining pools – ETH/USDT, ETH/USDC, ETH/DAI, and ETH/WBT.      SushiSwap, a genetic clone of Uni, burst on the scene as a fully decentralized (read: not venture-backed) market maker, offering the one thing Uniswap lacked: a governance token.      Sushi planned to attract Uniswap users by offering steep rewards for those that migrated to its platform. Uniswap responded to the threat by airdropping some 1 billion UNI governance tokens to community members, team members and investors, and instituting the liquidity mining program.      Since launch, Uniswap’s token has been an experiment in community governance. Recently, a proposal with popular support to further disseminated UNI tokens to those kept out of the initial airdrop fell short by less than 2.5 million “votes.”      Now, the community is facing another vote to reinstate the liquidity mining program. On Monday, Audius strategy lead Cooper Turley and pseudonymous “monet supply” Monday presented a proposal to reinstate the program at a diminished scale.      The proposal will have to pass a series of governance polls before farming restarts Dec. 4. Uniswap’s total value under lock (TVL) first broke $1 billion in September after introducing UNI rewards. The AMM peaked at just over $3 billion in TVL on Nov. 13.      Now, facing a tough governance vote, total value on the platform tanked nearly 55% to $1.4 billion at press time, according to DeFi Pulse.

42433138,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO3Mlh,1605632717,Blockchain Startup Raises $12M Series A to Turn Brands Into Cellular Networks,"OXIO wants to use blockchain to make “Telecom-as-a-Service” as common as SaaS.      To that end, the New York-based startup is announcing Tuesday a $12 million Series A funding round, led by Brazilian VC monashees and Atlantico Capital, with participation from FinTech Collective and Multicoin Capital. It takes the firm’s total fundraising to $20 million since late 2019.      OXIO allows big brands to offer telco-type services by turning mobile data into a tradeable digital asset using tokens on blockchains. Tokenized data packages will be particularly useful in emerging markets like Mexico where mobile internet is relatively expensive, the company says.      The big picture for OXIO is a reboot of the mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) model (U.K.-based Virgin was a well-known exponent of this original trend). It’s not an entirely novel idea: Hong Kong-based DENT Wireless, which is backed by Samsung Blockchain, also offers a token to foster mobile data trading.      OXIO allows firms to piggyback on the best local telecom or satellite infrastructure via an API. It also opens the door to much more in the way of differentiation of services rather than simply offering a branded version of the host’s internet or WiFi, according to OXIO co-founder and CEO Nicolas Girard.      “It’s less about becoming a telco and just providing exactly what Verizon and others have been doing, and more about brands adding their own spin while getting closer to their customers,” said Girard. “So if a brand becomes a mobile operator, it can differentiate and offer plans that tie into what it does as a business, whether it’s e-commerce, or retail, or the gig economy.”    Mobile data tokens    Wireless data is a $2.5 trillion industry and yet there’s no obvious way to trade it, Girard said. This is where blockchain comes in; it’s just one component, but an important part of the vision, he said.      OXIO has been running trials using the Stellar blockchain and, most recently, is testing out Solana and Andreessen Horowitz-backed Near Protocol, Girard added.      “The best way to think about the role of the blockchain is around a wireless data token, so harnessing wireless as an asset class,” said Girard. “You’ve never traded wireless because there’s no instrument to address it.”      Read more: Ocean v3 Brings Wave of Data Monetization Tools to Ethereum      Wireless data varies in terms of cost and coverage depending on which country and also on the technology, such as hotel room WiFi or on a plane. In Mexico, for example, where mobile users consume just over 2GB a month (the average U.S. user consumes 2.5x that), that mobile data costs about $4.77 for 1 gigabyte. This places Mexico 158th in the world in terms of affordability.      This is why OXIO embarked on pilot programs with some of Mexico's largest companies across retail, convenience stores, food and beverage, and drugstores, Girard said.      “The big picture is we are trying to build the first global network as a resource,” said Girard. “So we are saying wireless can be a tradable asset, and in order to get mainstream global adoption of that network there can be a token that represents that fungible wireless data.”      As in classic crypto-economic theory, tokenizing mobile data could help align the interests of different stakeholders, said Girard.      Looking ahead, blockchain can also play a part in how the “gold mine” of accumulated user data can be handled in such a way as to protect customer privacy while mining the value of that data, he said. (The Ocean project has taken this idea of monetizing data furthest in the blockchain world, using the concept of decentralized data marketplaces.)      “If you’re creating new business models to subsidize connectivity, basically that means the user can pay with money or pay with data. And that’s also where the blockchain comes into play,” said Girard.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | NEAR,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/11/17/blockchain-startup-raises-12m-series-a-to-turn-brands-into-cellular-networks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7740e2fb4a0a7972cd94e39aa133c63b522419c1-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433136,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO3Mjh,1605626270,The Smart Money Economy,"Over the last several weeks, crypto asset prices have climbed to new heights. Bitcoin alone has broken the $300 billion market capitalization barrier, equivalent to the M1 money supply of a number of countries – from Poland, to Belgium or Austria. We can point to multiple underlying causes, including the U.S. election, the deployment of the Chinese CBDC and its $300 million in volume, and continued growth in decentralized finance and dollar-denominated stablecoins. But these symptoms are more complex than mere asset appreciation.      To understand what 21st century money looks like, let’s review the payments value chain, and in particular the relationships among a monetary instrument, financial infrastructure, the payment rail, the current assortment of payment companies and networks, and software ecosystems. In parsing the difference between the developments in these adjacent categories, we can more clearly see what progress looks like, as well as the potential destinations for our future.    Lex Sokolin, a CoinDesk columnist, is global fintech co-head at ConsenSys, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based blockchain software company. The following is adapted from his Fintech Blueprint newsletter.    It is not merely that value is being digitized into an online crypto wallet. Rather, the software economy will be anchored to programmable blockchains, and those blockchains will function as the payment rails and payment networks on which sovereign and decentralized currencies are deployed.    Payments on today’s networks    The usual comparison for payments rails is the Visa card network, sitting at about $420 billion in market capitalization. That valuation is not money supply, but a market valuation of the discounted cash flows of owning a payment network. The crypto equivalent would be the revenue pool accruing to miners and validators participating in securing the Bitcoin or Ethereum blockchains. The card network provides the payments infrastructure in the sense that it allows for money to move around on its network of nodes.      Those nodes are financial or economic in nature and speak in the language of money – banks, card issuers, e-commerce sites, point of sale terminals, regulators, and so on. You can send a little bit of messaging around, but primarily you are sending a financial instrument. Value accrues to the network shareholder due to the small rent you take across all transactions.      Therefore, your incentive as Visa is to maximize the organizational share of all transactions by broadening the network across the world and into every technological sphere. Through scale, your network gets better for participants. A payments infrastructure is a naturally occurring monopoly, like Facebook and Google. Arguably, blockchains follow similar winner-take-all dynamics. The stated Visa strategy is to build a ""network of networks"" and to pay $5 billion for startups like Plaid. Therefore it is likely that the traditional card networks will plug into, or overlay on top of, blockchain-based payments. This game played out in an analogous way across credit cards, e-commerce, and mobile point of sale.      See also: Lex Sokolin - Software Ate the World, Here’s How It Eats Finance      Another adoption vector for crypto assets is through existing payment gateways and processors. PayPal connects to more than 25 million merchants and 350 million users. Perhaps the recent BTC price run is in part driven by the much-discussed move by PayPal to finally incorporate bitcoin into its currency options. While we think the PayPal news is interesting and promising, it is still a nascent development. Allowing the purchase and sale of a commodity using a third-party trust company (Paxos) for capital gain is quite different from adopting a currency for exchange in economic activity.      PayPal sits one layer higher up the stack from Visa. It is the checkout experience for a meaningful portion of the internet. Square is the checkout experience for a meaningful portion of terrestrial small business. What's nice about PayPal and Stripe and Square and generally that footprint of modern payments companies is they are software-native and have APIs and UIs. They integrate into things and are part of the modern world. Most still ride the Visa or Mastercard ""rails"" and all prioritize the financial instrument of sovereign money. Their value accrues from aggregating the consumer or merchant footprint, and giving economic activity a way to flow in novel patterns.      The type of economic activity is key. Increasingly, it is software-based and embedded in workflows that reside in the cloud. Weaving payments and financial experiences into media and commerce is then a next frontier for traditional payments companies.    CBDCs    Governments are aware of the digitization happening in their national industries. Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are one way for them to participate more directly in software-based economic activity, by moving the instrument of money onto emerging networks. Such action pre-empts public crypto assets from taking on the shape of money. A recent spate of projects across Thailand, Australia, France and Hong Kong highlights the race towards figuring out the right model.    The blockchain is not just a record of transactions. It is also a programmable environment that can execute software.    That model is often discussed in the context of Facebook's Libra private stablecoin network and China's deployment and expansion of itsr national digital currency. The projects split into (1) wholesale CBDCs, which largely reinforce and optimize the role of banking institutions relative to the central bank's money management authority, and (2) retail CBDCs, which would bypass the banks and go directly into the wallets of consumers. The first option is about efficiency and industry cost mutualization. The second is more deeply transformative, and analogizes closely to owning bitcoin and using it to transact.      In many of the projects above, there is a combination of a financial institution, a technology consulting firm and a blockchain company coming together. The enterprise blockchains split between IBM/Hyperledger Fabric, R3/Corda and ConsenSys/Quorum (an Ethereum protocol). The current requirements from central banks focus on the software protocol as the ledger, determining where transaction information actually lives and how it is hosted and processed. Making sure the network functions and reflects the requirements of a central bank and other industry constituents is the work of standing up a CBDC.      But this initial view is missing a large part of the story. The blockchain is not just a record of transactions. It is also a programmable environment that can execute software. We will see that this has deep implications for payment industry structure.      See also: Michael Casey and Sheila Warren - Understanding China’s Fast-Approaching Digital Yuan      Look at the recent developments in China. Its digital yuan DCEP project has over 20 companies involved in development and launch, with a preferred spot given to the state-run banks. China's government has been giving out free money to citizens in the form of the new currency to prove the viability of the concept and drive adoption, and volumes are in the hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars. But the key part to understand is the relationship of this digital currency to the commerce ecosystems of the payments companies, WeChat and Alipay. DCEP is the money – when it sits in a wallet on the phone, it is merely a financial instrument. When you transfer it around between participants, you are reconciling financial data with the data hosted by the central government.      Financial institutions hold accounts at central banks and already do this all the time. Don't get us wrong, it is certainly disruptive. You could build taxation directly into consumer transaction flows or implement universal basic income or deliver COVID-related distributions with ease. But still, money is an instrument. It is not the economy.     The smart money economy    Ant Financial was going to have the world's largest initial public offering of $34 billion, which was 870x oversubscribed. The company is a fantastic story of innovation, global payments technology, and the digital growth of 80 million Chinese small businesses. It is precisely that small business economy that Alibaba was able to package into the mobile phone and deploy to 700 million people on the Ant Financial payment rail. To engage with Chinese commerce requires Ant’s payments rails, in the same way that apps on the iPhone need Apple’s operating system.      And yet, the Chinese authorities shut down the IPO and are forcing the company to return money to investors. Perhaps it was Jack Ma, the country's wealthiest private businessman ($50+ billion net worth), not sufficiently following the party line about regulation. Or perhaps, as the country tries to launch a national digital money, one must flex against the largest digital storefront in which that money must be used. If the Chinese government is trying to close down competition related to its digital yuan, removing stablecoins and other cash equivalents to scale out its national solution and having Ant (and Tencent) under clear instruction becomes paramount.      See also: Lex Sokolin - DeFi Protocols Should Act More Like Fiduciaries      In other words, what is interesting about money supply is not the money, but what you can do with it. Ant Financial gives us an example of how a financial rail can live within mobile commerce and become worth $250 billion in enterprise value as that commerce grows. A programmable blockchain like Ethereum is similarly able to incorporate the functions and business logic of the payments companies, as well as the digital economy of Apple’s operating system, assuming scaling works out of course. Today, examples already include decentralized finance, crypto art and various virtual worlds. A blockchain-based CBDC will lead to even deeper integration between money, payments infrastructure and digital commerce.      Remember that this happened to the internet on a 20-year time horizon. The trillion-dollar valuations supported by emergent business models – the operating system of the iPhone and the shopping footprint of Amazon – give us the necessary patience and proof. Neither commercial path was yet available when people were trying to figure out the protocols to stitch together the Web.      The CBDC projects today ask the question of how to move money around. Bitcoin has answered this question, and perhaps an applied architecture like permissioned Ethereum will solve this for national currencies. The deeper question is, what does an economy connected to a CBDC look like? What is the shape of merchants and applications that accept digital currency? Where do they perform their economic functions? If we think the venue for computing will increasingly be on blockchains, that suggests CBDC rails should come not just with pre-installed national money but also pre-installed applications for the use of that money. A payment rail will only be adopted if it is useful, and if it is applicable to a meaningful portion of human economic activity.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY,Lex Sokolin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/11/17/the-smart-money-economy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/94b0abb5cdc52cb08d4d968c08a1419694667b1f-1420x982.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

That’s 10 times more than the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of large U.S. stocks.       “Bears are in disbelief,” the digital-asset market analysis firm Arcane Research wrote early Tuesday in a report, noting that the cryptocurrency is on track to post its sixth straight weekly gain. “It seems like there is nothing stopping bitcoin at the moment.”       In traditional markets, European shares slid and U.S. stock futures pointed to a lower open as investors worried that the potentially economic scarring from a resurgence in the coronavirus. Gold weakened 0.1% to $1,888 an ounce.      Read More: Bitcoin Slices Through $17,000 as Market Cap Nears All-Time High    Market moves    Look no further than the rapid growth this year in the white-hot arena of decentralized finance, or DeFi, and it’s clear why the Ethereum blockchain is dominating so many conversations right now in the digital-asset industry.      The second-largest blockchain’s native cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), is up 266% this year – twice as much as mooning bitcoin (BTC).      But a lot of savvy digital-asset investors are hedging their bets, buying tokens associated with upstart blockchains that could potentially grab market share from the Ethereum network, often referred to as a “world computer” due to its versatility and programmability.      One such token is dot (DOT), of the Polkadot blockchain, whose co-founder Gavin Wood was a co-founder of Ethereum. Wood wrote the original project white paper for Polkadot in 2016, just a year after the Ethereum network launched.      Since going live in mid-August on exchanges after the Polkadot network performed a 100:1 split, the dot token is up over 44%. Over the same period, Ethereum’s ether has only climbed a bit over 8%.      “The market and investor appetite has been really strong for Polkadot’s dot token,” said Keld van Schreven, managing director of the investment firm KR1, which includes Polkadot in its portfolio. An initial valuation from a pre-network launch fundraising was priced around $3, he said. “So to consistently trade above $4 since then has been really encouraging.”      - Daniel Cawrey      Read More: As DeFi Grows, Investors Look to Polkadot to Be the Next Ethereum    Bitcoin watch    Bitcoin's strong rally continues with demand outstripping supply amid the heightened expectations of swift global economic recovery on potential coronavirus vaccines.      The top cryptocurrency by market value rose to fresh 33-month highs above $17,000 during the early U.S. trading hours. Prices are up 20% this month alone.      Bitcoin has been characterized by some investors as ""digital gold"" due to a belief the cryptocurrency can serve as an effective hedge against inflation. But in recent weeks, bitcoin prices have gained as gold has struggled, following the news that two drugmakers, Pfizer and Moderna, had announced promising results in developing coronavirus vaccines.      The possibility that a vaccine might arrive early next year, helping the global economy to return toward pre-pandemic output levels sooner than expected, has triggered a rotation of money out of defensive assets and into risk assets, according to Ole Hansen, head of the commodity strategy at Saxo Bank.      Bitcoin, however, has stayed bid on strong holding sentiment and the supply shortage. “Since bitcoin was at $11,400 a month ago, miners have been selling an average of 11 bitcoins per hour on exchanges. In comparison, 214 coins per hour have been scooped off exchanges,” Willy Woo, an on-chain analyst and the author of The Bitcoin Forecast newsletter, tweeted early Tuesday.      With the global stockpile of negative yielding bonds at record highs and the U.S. dollar expected to depreciate on coronavirus vaccine optimism and continued money printing by the Federal Reserve, the odds appear stacked in favor of a rally to record highs above $20,000.

42433130,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO3MVh,1605621644,"Balaji Srinivasan, HashKey Back $2M Round in Twitter Privacy Tool Mask Network","Mask Network, the protocol that allows users to send encrypted messages, cryptocurrencies and even dapps over Twitter and Facebook, announced a $2 million funding round Tuesday co-led by HashKey and Hash Global.      Other participants included Alameda Research, Sino Global and personal investors including Balaji Srinivasan, who touted the network back in September.      “Yes, you’re using Twitter, Facebook or eventually Reddit, but you’ll realize your picture and your file never existed on those platforms,” Mask Network founder Suji Yan told CoinDesk in an interview, translated from Mandarin.      The company recently engaged its Twitter community with random draws of 538 election-themed non-fungible tokens (NFTs). (The number of Trump and Biden cards issued mirrors the number of Electoral College votes each U.S. presidential candidate ended up winning.)      “We got into this election NFT game to prove to more users that Web 3.0 can be used on Web 2.0,” Yan told CoinDesk.      The protocol currently has over 800,000 downloads across its product suite but only 30,000 active users. Yan says that’s because only crypto-native experts really understand the product.      Mask Network currently partners with companies such as Arweave to send encrypted files and MakerDAO for users to send DAI via Twitter “red envelopes,” which founder Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin took advantage of this Chinese New Year.    Growth plans    Yan told CoinDesk the funding round will help the company to decentralize and partner with other companies to add more functions over the next two quarters.      “Imagine how powerful it would be if Square built their function on Twitter through MetaMask,” Yan said. “When we’re fully decentralized, they won’t need us to build that.”      Becoming a fully decentralized company would also enable the Shanghai-based startup to attract more Chinese users, by building MetaMask’s current features onto Chinese social media apps like WeChat or Weibo.      Read more: MetaMask Gets Into the Decentralized Exchange Aggregation Business With Token Swaps      “Our current centralized operating model is very dangerous in China,” Yan told CoinDesk. Through a future launch of a governance token, the Mask team hopes to ease the risk of being deplatformed.      “They can kill us but they can’t kill a DAO or a file on Arweave,” Yan said.      This current funding round also included many Chinese investors. Yan said the reason for that may be because “U.S. VCs seem to be afraid that Facebook is involved.”      The company also has plans to launch “Initial Twitter Offerings” before the end of this year. It will allow users to discover new token launches and purchase the tokens – all without leaving Twitter.      Lead investor HashKey said via Telegram, “We firmly believe that the Mask team will keep this amazing world by pursuing liberty of encryption and privacy.”      Indeed, Yan said the company’s ultimate goal is to achieve a declaration of independence in cyberspace.      “Today in 2020, we finally saw an awakened need for independence of governance on social media,” Yan said. “The only thing that’s missing is a portal to a new, open internet.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | AR,Doreen Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/11/17/balaji-srinivasan-hashkey-back-2m-round-in-twitter-privacy-tool-mask-network,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/988fda36d47574bd7df4ba633a45fdecf6a20786-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433129,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO3MXh,1605618000,New Mac Update Leaves Users No Room to Escape Data Collection,"Apple's most recent update, Big Sur, makes a feature that logs device activity for offline (and online) applications practically impossible for privacy solutions to bypass.  The monitoring is yet another example of Apple’s privacy-compromising design choices, despite the company’s efforts to present itself as a privacy ally.  VPNs and other firewalls cannot circumvent the feature.  Security researchers suggest that users who care about their digital privacy explore other, open-source alternatives.    On Nov. 12, Mac users complained their computers were acting sluggish. This sluggishness coincided with the release of Big Sur, the latest Mac update from Apple.      After the update was released, a technical error disrupted the servers Apple uses for OCSP requests, the packets of data that verify a computer’s SSL certificate when it accesses online applications. Apple devices were shutting down because these OCSP requests weren’t reaching Apple servers.      As some users looked closer, it became very clear why the devices failed when the OCSP servers were failing: Every time a user opens an application (even an offline one), that action is being tagged and traced by Apple’s OCSP servers.      This feature was introduced in Apple’s Catalina update, but certain tools (like Little Snitch) could be used to bypass it. Now, with Big Sur, there’s no practical way for average Mac users to thwart the feature.      Apple has touted itself as pushing privacy as the core of its mission, perhaps most publicly by rebuffing law enforcement demands to unlock one of the San Bernardino, Calif., shooter's iPhones after the December 2015 attack.      But these new revelations demonstrate some of the inherent flaws in centralized data collection – you have to trust Apple not to share this information (or trust them to not be coerced into revealing it to a government agency). In this case, though, Apple’s siloing of data through Big Sur may not even be the primary issue because these OCSP requests are transmitted unencrypted, meaning the contents can be read by any surveilling party that intercepts them.      Thus, if Mac users want out from under Apple’s eye, they’re going to need to explore alternatives.    Mac update enables offline activity logging    “On modern versions of macOS, you simply can’t power on your computer, launch a text editor or eBook reader, and write or read without a log of your activity being transmitted and stored,” hacker and security researcher Jeffrey Paul writes in a blog post.      Paul told CoinDesk in an email he doesn’t think “Apple has ill intent here,” but that its goal is to monitor malware and other illicit software on its devices.      The problem, though, is these OCSP requests are unencrypted and so “vulnerable to passive monitoring.” This leaves the data open to collection and parsing at the hands of “large-scale passive monitoring organizations"" such as the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA).      “This is, of course, terrible practice, and despite being the industry standard, Apple should know better, as they are cryptography experts (who run their own certificate authority and regularly use relatively advanced cryptographic tools like client certificates and cert pinning),” Paul wrote over email.      Telemetry is a diagnostic process by which servers track how a device is used. Apple’s systems now broadcast an open, ""inadvertent telemetry"" that any entity tapped into the internet's communication channels can access, Paul explained.      “The real privacy risk here is not that Apple might be collecting this data. They're likely not, as I believe that this is an attempt by Apple to prevent malware from being able to execute on their platform. The problem is that it serves as *inadvertent* telemetry to anyone who's listening on the wire, which, in the United States, is every major ISP and the national military,” he continued.      These kinds of concerns have led to arguments against centralized servers for contact tracing in the European Union. They’ve also encouraged recent pushes for mixnets, which mix network traffic specifically to avoid passive metadata observation.      Apple’s devices have always been a walled garden of sorts. Applications and software from unverified publishers, for instance, must be manually approved by users. The ostensible aim of such controls is to protect the user, but as Cory Doctorow recently emphasized to CoinDesk over email, these controls can override agency in certain scenarios (for example, when Apple removed thousands of apps from its Chinese app store).      “I think this is a great example of what Bruce Schneier calls ""feudal security,"" Doctorow told CoinDesk, commenting on the activity logging feature. “The idea that our systems no longer give us the power to protect ourselves, but rather require us to surrender our destiny to one of the great techno-warlords of the age (Facebook, Google, Apple, Msft, etc.), who will protect us ... from everyone except [t]hemselves.”    Data privacy solutions    For any Mac users hoping to escape the surveillance, solutions are going to have to come from outside Apple’s locus of influence.      Before the Big Sur Mac update, VPNs or firewalls like Little Snitch would have kept your computer from leaking information. But Big Sur trumps this, said Valdas Petrulis, co-founder and lead software engineer at Mysterium Network, a decentralized VPN protocol..      “MacOS Big Sur (version 11.0) allows traffic to bypass usual routing and firewall rules. Which simply means Little Snitch won’t be able to monitor and block this, and neither can a VPN be able to help or hide you. MacOS has now simply forbidden that.”      Sean O’Brien, the principal researcher at ExpressVPN’s Digital Security Lab, said that ultimately a VPN will not “prevent Apple from being able to collect this data, but [it] “would at least protect it from other network intermediaries as it travels over the internet.”      There is a way to disable the feature, though Paul said only MacOS experts should try this. Apple changes which system services you can disable with each update, Paul said, so this may be changed in the future.      “Really, though, the #1 thing that consumers can do to protect their privacy when using Apple devices is to *never* use iCloud, and to not use iMessage,” Paul continued. iCloud data is unencrypted, he said, allowing “the FBI or U.S. military to read pretty much everyone's complete iMessage history without ever touching the device.”    Alternatives?    The only way to escape Apple’s panopticon, according to Paul? “Open-source software that doesn't spy on you.” This used to mean tools like Little Snitch, Tor and VPNs, but now that Apple has a tighter grip on personal privacy, those seriously worried about their privacy can only change hardware and software providers.      Perhaps as testament to users making a change, Mysterium CMO Sharmini Ravindran said the service has experienced “8 to 10 times as much interest” in its Windows application versus its Mac version.      Of course, Microsoft is no privacy saint either, meaning the free and open-source Linux software, long the choice of most privacy advocates, could be the safest bet.      But that’s only going to work if your typical Mac user cares enough about the privacy-leaking feature. And if he or she does care, there’s also the matter of knowing enough about computers to boot and maintain Linux. One of Apple’s key selling points is that it’s user friendly for even the most tech-averse individuals, which can be appealing given privacy tech is sometimes full of friction for people who are used to logging into everything using Face ID.      Then again, Apple has also been praised as a privacy-conscious company, and public perception is always changing.      “Not only is Apple exposing its customers to risk from the company's own executives and corporate decisions, but it's also creating a moral hazard for governments, inviting them to coerce Apple into (ab)using this facility to harm – not help – its users,” said Doctorow.",NEGATIVE,없음,REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media, Benjamin Powers",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/11/17/new-mac-update-leaves-users-no-room-to-escape-data-collection,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/98be6306762956e674f70449fa443a9e4c044d55-2560x1962.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433139,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO3Mnh,1605616523,Gold Lags Far Behind Bitcoin as Vaccine Optimism Buoys Markets,"Bitcoin is outshining gold by a significant margin in price terms as expectations soar of a swift global economic recovery enabled by promising coronavirus vaccines.      While the top cryptocurrency by market value has risen 22% to cross $17,000 this month, the precious metal is up just 0.5% at the current price of $1,890 per ounce.      The demand for traditional haven assets such as gold has declined this month as two Big Pharma firms, Pfizer and Moderna, announced positive results for their experimental coronavirus vaccines.      The resulting speculation that the global economy may well return to normality as soon as the second half of 2021 has triggered a rotation of money out of defensive assets and into risk assets, according to an outlook from Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank.      Bitcoin, too, is considered ""digital gold"" by many. However, the increased risk appetite in traditional markets and the record high in U.S. stocks have so far failed to put the brakes on bitcoin's rally.      The cryptocurrency managed to keep gains above $15,000 last Monday despite the Pfizer news, and jumped nearly 5% to $15,885 yesterday, even as Moderna's announcement bolstered the stock markets. On both days, gold suffered notable losses.      Bitcoin's resilience may be associated with strong holding sentiment and a supply shortage. ""Since bitcoin was at $11,400 a month ago, miners have been selling an average of 11 bitcoins per hour on exchanges. In comparison, 214 coins per hour have been scooped off exchanges,"" Willy Woo, an on-chain analyst and author of ""The Bitcoin Forecast"" newsletter, tweeted early on Tuesday.      The market has been buoyed by increased institutional participation and technical charts showing little resistance ahead of the 2017 record high of $20,000.      Moving forward, the odds look stacked in favor of rallies for both bitcoin and gold because the U.S. dollar is expected to weaken on the vaccine optimism and other factors.

The rise pushes the leading cryptocurrency's total market capitalization to over $315 billion, just short of its $335 billion record.      Since its yearly lows below $4,000 in March, when prices crashed over 50% in a single day, BTC has rebounded by more than 330%. Since Jan. 1, the leading cryptocurrency has gained 130%.      BTC's ""spectacular surge"" in 2020 largely mirrors its 2017 trajectory, Ben Zhou, co-founder and CEO of derivatives exchange Bybit, told CoinDesk in an email. One key difference this time, however, is the ""infusion of institutional money.""      With Monday's rally, BTC is now trading roughly 15% below its all-time high of almost $20,000 set in December 2017.      Alternate cryptocurrencies (altcoins) are following in bitcoin's wake. Leading altcoin ether (ETH) is trading at $465 at last check, up 20% this month. Litecoin (LTC) has gained around 30% month to date. Even dogecoin, which stayed quiet after its short-lived TikTok craze in July, spiked nearly 10% Monday, before giving back some of its gains in the afternoon trading hours.      Despite BTC's strong performance in a predominantly spot market-driven rally fueled by North American buyers, exchange trading volumes remain relatively unimpressive. For example, monthly volume of Coinbase's BTC/USD trading pair has stayed nearly flat since June.      November could mark a shift in that trend, however, as over-the-counter trading is growing at a steady clip. Halfway through November, volume at the industry-leading desk B2C2 was roughly equal to the whole month of October, said founder Max Boonen in an email.

A closed-end investment fund, it will invest directly in bitcoin and will be priced using the Bloomberg Galaxy Bitcoin Index.  The firms aim to bring fund investors access to bitcoin via an ""institutional-quality"" platform.

42433143,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO3Mth,1605610800,"As DeFi Grows, Investors Look to Polkadot to Be the Next Ethereum","Look no further than the rapid growth this year in the white-hot arena of decentralized finance, or DeFi, and it’s clear why the Ethereum blockchain is dominating so many conversations right now in the digital-asset industry.      The second-largest blockchain’s native cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), is up 266% this year – twice as much as mooning bitcoin (BTC).      But a lot of savvy digital-asset investors are hedging their bets, buying tokens associated with upstart blockchains that could potentially grab market share from the Ethereum network, often referred to as a “world computer” due to its versatility and programmability.      One such token is dot (DOT), of the Polkadot blockchain, whose co-founder Gavin Wood was a co-founder of Ethereum. Wood wrote the original project white paper for Polkadot in 2016, just a year after the Ethereum network launched.      Since going live in mid-August on exchanges after the Polkadot network performed a 100:1 split, the dot token is up over 44%. Over the same period, Ethereum’s ether has only climbed a bit over 8%.      “The market and investor appetite has been really strong for Polkadot’s dot token,” said Keld van Schreven, managing director of the investment firm KR1, which includes Polkadot in its portfolio. An initial valuation from a pre-network launch fundraising was priced around $3, he said. “So to consistently trade above $4 since then has been really encouraging.”    Parachains and Moonbeam    At the heart of Polkadot is the concept of “parachains,” which are blockchains that can run higher transaction throughput than Ethereum because of more sophisticated design. According to Peter Mauric, head of public affairs at Parity Technologies, the term is short for “parallel blockchains.”      “Parachains can process more transactions than a single blockchain because the transactions are spread across multiple computers, similar to parallel processing,” Mauric told CoinDesk in an email.      A key player behind the network’s development is Parity Technologies, a for-profit European-headquartered firm building tools for the open-source Polkadot platform.      Parity also is the company behind Substrate, a set of tools for developers to create blockchain applications with Polkadot, often known as decentralized apps, or dapps.      Read more: Reef Finance Raises $3.9M for Cross-Chain DeFi on Polkadot      “Substrate packages everything the core developers at Parity have learned building, launching and maintaining Ethereum 1.0, Bitcoin, Zcash and now Polkadot,” Mauric told CoinDesk. “The hope is this creates a middle ground, where a high-quality development team can build and launch their own chain without the incredibly large overhead associated with building a blockchain from scratch.”      Polkadot backers say software engineers also utilize Moonbeam, a Boston startup that has built its own parachain to mimic a toolkit that would look familiar to Ethereum developers.      “The purpose of the Moonbeam parachain is that we're implementing, effectively, the closest we can make it to the Ethereum feature set at its core,” said Derek Yoo, the project’s founder, in a video conference call. Yoo has been actively engaging with Ethereum projects to adopt the technology. “If we’ve done our job well, we’re trying to make something that is low-friction and easy to adopt for an existing Ethereum project.”      Projects bringing use cases to Polkadot include Interlay, which plans to launch a wrapped bitcoin project called “PolkaBTC” in 2021, and cross-chain liquidity provider Equilibrium, which will be the first Polkadot project to be audited by Quantstamp.      KR1’s van Schreven says he is tracking around 230 projects being built on the platform.      When talking to Polkadot ecosystem stakeholders, they discourage the term “Ethereum killer” as many like to categorize it, because many see Polkadot as a complement to the overall ecosystem, not a rival.    Progression from or rival to Ethereum?    “We’re still Ethereum supporters,” van Schreven said. “But we see the Polkadot approach as being a kind of the natural progression of the whole ecosystem, really.”      The ability for Polkadot to spin up new blockchains is enticing from an investment perspective, van Schreven says.      Despite supporting Ethereum, van Schreven thinks Polkadot’s “clean sheet” will allow it to offer brand-new features in scalability, finality and governance that developers will adopt.      Read more: Parity Upgrades Polkadot’s Underlying Tech to Make Custom Blockchain Building Easier      Bottlenecks and throughput capacity have proved to be an issue for Ethereum, as evidenced by elevated congestion and transaction fees on the network in recent months.      And Ethereum’s governance seems to be centered more around its leader, Vitalik Buterin, than the rigorous systemized version of governance that Polkadot hopes to achieve, according to Schreven.      All of this could lead to adoption of the network by more developers – partly how Ethereum has achieved its success – and Polkadot’s parachains might take things to the next level.      “We're going to see a growth of economic activity from all these chains because of this cross-chain aspect of the Polkadot ecosystem,“ van Schreven added. “Obviously, some of that will take away from Ethereum.”",POSITIVE,BTC | DOT | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | DOT | ETH,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/17/as-defi-grows-investors-look-to-polkadot-to-be-the-next-ethereum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9a7aac4befaf11e187e82294dfc2743b28f0ed4d-2145x1370.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The move means U.S. customers with Cuban families or friends will now have to find alternate methods of sending money back home.      “Today we informed our customers they have limited time to send money to their loved ones from the U.S. to Cuba, due to a new U.S. Government rule that will take effect on Nov. 26, 2020,” Western Union said in a blog post.      The development is a reminder of cryptocurrency’s core value proposition: Decentralized networks know no borders and are open to all comers on the sending and receiving ends (though using centralized exchanges can bring the same issues).      U.S.-Cuba relations have been rocky since the Communist regime established itself in 1959 and reached a low in 1961 at the height of the Cold War.      After several years of normalizing relations between the two nations under the Obama administration, U.S. President Donald Trump started reinstating sanctions and travel restrictions in 2017.      Local YouTube influencer Erich García Cruz told CoinDesk previously that Cubans have been circumventing these monetary restrictions by turning to cryptocurrency.      “Thousands of Cubans buy cards at Bitrefill to consume those digital services by paying with cryptocurrencies. There is no other way,” said Cruz in an August interview referring to the lightning-centric bitcoin startup.      See also: How Bitcoin Fits Into Lebanon’s Banking Crisis      Still, Western Union said it would ""continue to explore every possible option to find a solution"" for its customers despite the U.S. remittance ban, which is intended to block funds from being sent to Cuban military, intelligence, or security services or staff.      According to Western Union, customers can no longer send U.S. dollars to Cuba as of Nov. 22, while Cuban recipients cannot receive funds after Nov. 23.

Once referred to as the silver to bitcoin's gold, litecoin has far fallen behind the top cryptocurrency in recent years. Bitcoin's market cap is now near $310 billion, over 60 times greater.      Litecoin's recovery from September lows near $40 picked up the pace on Oct. 21 after online payments giant PayPal announced support for the cryptocurrency alongside bitcoin, ether and bitcoin cash. Litecoin jumped over 13% at the news, confirming a bullish pattern on technical charts, and has remained bid ever since.      While litecoin is up 80% this year, bitcoin has gained over 120%. The first cryptocurrency reached a 33-month high of $16,885 on Monday and was last seen at $16,700. Prices have risen by more than $6,000 since early October, given a push by investments from notable companies.

As reported by Reuters on Monday, Peiter Zatko, a prominent white-hat hacker going by the handle ""Mudge,"" said he will take charge of security, site integrity and engineering on behalf of the social media giant.      ""Looks like the cat is out of the bag,"" said Zatko in a tweet on Monday. ""I’m very excited to be joining the executive team at Twitter! I truly believe in the mission of (equitably) serving the public conversation.""      Zatko will answer directly to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and will take over management of security functions at the social media site after a 45-60 day review, per Reuters' reporting.      The infamous hacker made a name for himself in the 1990s when he undertook classified work for a government contractor while also leading a hacking group known as the Cult of the Dead Cow with the aim of exposing security flaws in Microsoft Windows.      See also: New York Regulator Calls for More Social Media Oversight After Twitter Hack      The new hire comes as part of Twitter's attempts to increase its security after a group of teenagers compromised 30 high-profile Twitter users. In the breaches, hijacked accounts sent out messages to their millions of followers falsely promising to double the money of users who sent in bitcoin – what's known as a crypto giveaway scam.      In a separate attack in September, hackers hijacked a Twitter account of Narendra Modi, the prime minister of India, disseminating messages asking for cryptocurrency donations. Twitter is now looking to tighten its defense against future attacks and guard against the threat of regulatory action.      Zatko had recently been charged with maintaining security at the San Francisco-based electronic payments platform Stripe, and also brings a wealth of experience from his time at Google and the Pentagon’s Defense Advanced Research and Projects Agency (DARPA).",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | RESEARCH,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/11/17/twitter-hires-noted-hacker-as-head-of-security-months-after-bitcoin-scam,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a569d2bbd0664d157644ed61cd9b307c5100c824-1900x1268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The startup's trust company unit, based in South Dakota, has applied to the OCC to convert to a national bank, according to a notice dated Nov. 9 and posted to the federal regulator's website.      The notice contains little else in the way of detail, except that Anchorage is represented by Dana Syracuse of the law firm Perkins Coie. Syracuse is a former general counsel of the New York Department of Financial Services and helped that agency draft its landmark BitLicense regulation.      This year Kraken, a crypto exchange, became the first such business to obtain a U.S. banking license, albeit a special-purpose one from Wyoming (the same kind obtained by digital asset startup Avanti). If its application is approved, Anchorage would be the first crypto company to get a national bank charter, explicitly allowing it to do business in all 50 states.      A banking charter would give Anchorage the clear authority to act as a ""qualified custodian"" for institutional investors under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules. Most crypto custody firms in the U.S. have trust company licenses, but the SEC signaled last week that it is unsure whether such entities, regulated at the state level and less stringently than banks, make the cut as qualified custodians.      Anchorage's application also comes at a time when the OCC, an agency that has existed since the Civil War, may be unusually receptive to such requests. Brian Brooks, the acting comptroller since May, is a former chief legal officer for the Coinbase exchange and has been notably focused on clearing the way for banks to participate in the crypto market – so much so that he was recently criticized by lawmakers for spending so much time on this niche during a pandemic.      In July, for example, Brooks' agency issued a letter clearing the way for national banks to safeguard private cryptographic keys for digital currency wallets, a business that until now has been the province of specialist firms like Anchorage.      Read more: Crypto Custodian Anchorage Gets SOC 1 Security Certification With Big 4 Auditor EY      ""Anchorage is encouraged by the recent positive progress out of the OCC with respect to regulatory clarity around custody of digital assets,"" Nathan McCauley, Anchorage's co-founder and CEO, said in a Telegram message.

42405430,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMSLe,1605578792,Origin Protocol Loses $7M in Latest DeFi Attack,"Stablecoin project Origin Dollar (OUSD) sustained a re-entrancy attack at 00:47 UTC Tuesday resulting in a loss of funds worth $7 million, including over $1 million deposited by Origin and its founders and employees.      The team has disabled deposits and the price of the project's native token is down 85% since the attack, according to CoinGecko.      Origin urged people not to buy OUSD on Uniswap or SushiSwap as those prices don't reflect the token's underlying assets. As CoinDesk reported in September, OUSD is backed by deposits of USDT, USDC and DAI and is designed to act somewhat like a savings account.      Tuesday's attack utilized a flash loan and flaws in OUSD contracts to initiate what is known as a ""rebase,"" according to Etherscan and an updated blog from the team. The attack artificially inflated the supply of OUSD tokens within the protocol before swapping the newly printed tokens on SushiSwap and Uniswap for USDT, the blog states.      Origin wrote in an update:    ""The attacker was able to create a rebase event inside the second mint after funds had moved to OUSD from the first large mint, but before the supply of OUSD increased. This created a massive rebase for everyone in the contract, including the attacker. The attacker then also received their first large OUSD mint, giving them in total more OUSD than the contract had assets.""    Early reports indicated Origin Protocol had suffered a $3.5 million flash loan attack or pricing oracle attack. Although the attacker employed a flash loan, Origin has not cited oracle manipulation as the technical culprit.      ""This has been a rough day for everyone involved, but we're not going anywhere. We're still here and will be working to rebuild,"" Origin Protocol co-founder Josh Fraser told CoinDesk in an email at 06:16 UTC, adding:    ""We'll be continuing to post updates with our community as we learn more. We want to express our gratitude to the community for the outpouring of support. We ask for continued patience as we work to recover the funds and make things right.""    UPDATE (Nov. 17, 05:53 UTC): Adds Origin's confirmation of the attack, an updated figure and information on the attacker's technique.

The internet’s ubiquity has led to societal cracks, from users’ lower self-esteem to impacting elections, while data ownership and privacy were traded, often haphazardly, for the sake of convenience.      As a result, a movement of scholars, professionals and activists are exploring alternative ways to remedy the imbalance in power via a data dividend – a mechanism whereby companies share profits derived from the use of personal data directly with users.
