The announcement – revealed as part of Overstock's second-quarter results – was paired with a separate disclosure revealing that Hong Kong-based equity firm GSR Capital has agreed to invest as much as $400 million in both tZero and Overstock. TZero said earlier this week that it had completed its token sale, though the firm originally had set a goal of raising $250 million through the offering.  During an earnings call, CEO Patrick Byrne reiterated a previous claim that tZero received $100 million in commitments when it first opened its token sale, saying ""we did the very best we could ... eventually we went to Asia. In Asia it was quite different. The first three people we met ... all said 'we'd take $60 million' [but] it proved extremely difficult to get money out of Asia for many different reasons.""  ""That's what slowed things down so much,"" he said, referencing multiple extensions to the company's token sale.  Specifically, the deal would see GSR acquiring up to $270 million in tZero equity – at a valuation of $1.5 billion – as well as up to roughly $104 million in Overstock shares. As well, GSR has agreed to buy $30 million worth of tZero Security Tokens from Overstock, according to statements.  Overstock first announced GSR's intention to purchase equity in the firm in June 2018, according to a press release. At the time, Overstock said GSR would purchase $160 million in tZero security tokens.  The company said that it ended its sale ""raising $134 million in aggregate consideration,"" adding that ""this sum includes $30 million from repayment of intercompany debt between tZero and Overstock.""  GSR is purchasing the same security tokens from Overstock that Overstock bought from tZero as part of ""a repurchase agreement,"" according to Thursday's press release.  CEO Patrick Byrne said that the funding would help support tZero efforts, particularly when accounting for the amount kicked in by GSR.  ""When GSR completes its planned investments, we should have over half-a-billion dollars,"" Byrne wrote in a statement Thursday. ""We believe this will provide ample capitalization with which to build a company that can upend global capital markets.""

Binance, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges by trading volume, announced back in March that it plans to launch a new public blockchain for the purposes of developing the Binance Chain, a platform to transfer and trade different crypto assets without a centralized operator. This week, CEO Changpeng Zhao provided the first demonstration of the Binance Decentralized Exchange and the Binance Chain.  ""Today, I have something really exciting to share with you guys. This will be the first demo for the Binance Decentralized Exchange, the Binance Chain,"" Zhao told viewers.  Zhao explained that his team of developers is ahead of schedule, saying in the demonstration that ""I thought this would happen one to two months later or more but again, the team delivered early.""  While the majority of the demo is footage of a command line terminal voiced over by one of the Binance Chain developers, the various activities depicted outline the basics of issuing, listing and trading crypto assets on the decentralized exchange.  Zhao insists the product remains in ""early stage development,"" adding that:  ""There's still a ton of work to be done to turn [it] into a final product. The team's working on it very aggressively. Nevertheless, this is a major milestone for Binance Chain.""  Indeed, other competitors to Binance such as cryptocurrency exchange Huobi announced similar plans in June to fund the creation of an open-sourced blockchain protocol aimed at one day evolving into a standalone decentralized exchange.  And while there are decentralized exchanges currently in existence in the crypto markets, data by analytics firm Alethio reports that most have varying degrees of centralization built into their model.

42401754,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2Lod,1533835780,Ethereum Classic Is Down 30% Since Its Listing on Coinbase,"The price of ethereum classic (ETC) has depreciated more than 30 percent against the U.S. dollar since its listing on Coinbase.  Prior to the August 7th listing date, ETC's price surged on two recent occasions, the first of which began on June 11th when Coinbase announced its intention to add ethereum classic to its platform. ETC's price went from $12.19 to $16.40 over the next 48 hours, printing a 34 percent gain.  The next and most dramatic boost began on August 3rd, following another announcement from Coinbase which stated that ETC trading would finally go live on August 7th.  From August 3rd to the 7th, the price rose more than 50 percent in U.S. dollar terms, hitting a peak of $21.25, according to data from Bitfinex.    It's not exactly a surprise when prices rise significantly after news of this nature is released, as investors would regard an asset as undervalued when taking into account the potential for a large cash flow increase that may accompany an exchange listing.  That said, this period of volatility often causes prices to rise to an amount where the asset is no longer considered undervalued, setting the stage for a market sell-off.  Ethereum classic was no exception to this reality. After the recent price high of $21.25, the price has fallen more than 30 percent versus the US dollar and is currently trading at $15.  That said, it's worth noting that the entire cryptocurrency market has been in a major slump as of late, shedding billions of dollars worth of market capitalization value during Wednesday's trading session.  Ethereum classic emerged in 2016 following the divisive collapse of The DAO, the ethereum-based funding vehicle that failed following a debilitating code exploit. An eventual ""fork"" of the ethereum blockchain to unwind losses tied to the DAO resulted in two distinct blockchains.

42401758,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2LtY,1533834040,"Attacker Installs Crypto Mining Malware on Over 170,000 Devices","More than 170,000 devices in Brazil were targeted in a cryptojacking attack last month.  According to a blog post published by security firm Trustwave, a wide-scale cyberattack was launched on MicroTik routers. The effort led to the installation of the Coinhive mining software in a ""mass"" infection of more than 17,000 devices.  Trustwave security researcher Simon Kenin wrote that all of the devices used ""the same sitekey,"" indicating that one entity reaped the mined tokens from all of the devices.  He wrote:  ""This attack may currently be prevalent in Brazil, but during the final stages of writing this blog, I also noticed other geo-locations being affected as well, so I believe this attack is intended to be on a global scale.""  According to a previous post by Trustwave, also co-authored by Kenin, Coinhive gained traction in 2017 as a service that claimed to provide monetizing solutions for websites without using any advertisements. Instead, site owners were to embed JavaScript code that would take hold of the central processing unit (CPU) power of site visitors to mine the cryptocurrency monero.  However, mining reportedly ended up costing site visitors up to 99 percent of their CPU processing power, leading to further issues for consumers as their devices generated more heat and used up large amounts of electricity.  Trustwave has since released a detection tool to block the mining malware, and as Kenin explains in his most recent post, readers should heed his ""warning call"" and patch any MikroTik devices ""as soon as possible,"" emphasizing that the severity of the attacks could reach ""hundreds of thousands"" of consumers around the globe.

The blockchain-based Wikipedia competitor announced the launch on Thursday, allowing users to earn its IQ tokens for adding or editing articles to the platform. These tokens, in turn, will let users participate and vote on network governance issues.  Everipedia's developers hope that this type of model will ensure that the platform remains fully independent of donations or advertisements. At the same time, the push toward decentralization is aimed at making the platform itself ""uncensorable.""  While Everipedia was previously accessible by anyone with an internet connection, the mainnet launch means it will now move from a traditional Web hosting service to a blockchain with a new URL.  The platform is built on top of the EOS blockchain platform, with Everipedia having moved to the EOS network earlier this year.  Everipedia announced that it would initially distribute its IQ tokens through an airdrop after EOS went live. Any user who owned EOS tokens could receive IQ tokens, the startup said at the time.  The startup notably boasts Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger as its chief information officer, as previously reported by CoinDesk.  In a statement, Sanger praised the launch, saying ""we are elated to release our minimum viable network which allows users to vote on and create articles in a decentralized manner for the first time.""

42401751,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2Llg,1533828657,Blockchain Research Institute Report Calls for Crypto Regulation Clarity,"""Regulators would be wise to avoid the chainsaw when microsurgery could do"" when it comes to blockchain technology, says author Don Tapscott.  Tapscott, the co-founder and executive director of the Blockchain Research Institute (BRI) – a multi-million dollar global blockchain think tank – published a report Wednesday calling for increased regulatory clarity on blockchain and cryptocurrencies. The report also recounts the takeaways from a roundtable discussion held in May on cryptocurrency regulation.  The report identifies the four ""core issues"" of regulatory oversight as being a lack of regulatory clarity, obsolete statutes, a lack of dialogue between both regulators and other stakeholders, as well as, financial service providers and blockchain entrepreneurs.  The report does caution a clear ""Canadian slant,"" given that the majority of the near 70 participants were from Canada.  This would explain why some of the major takeaway items are explicitly geared towards a Canadian audience, with one such action item being ""establish a national regulator in Canada"" highlighting the lack of a central securities regulatory authority in the country.  Other such recommendations in the report include forming action committees, encouraging special interest groups and creating clearer distinctions between different types of cryptocurrencies.  All of these recommendations, however, seem to support the sentiment for a greater degree of clarity when it comes to blockchain technology, not just with government officials but with the broader public as well.  Tapscott explains:  ""The new oil of the digital age is data...We need to help educate the public to distinguish a cryptocurrency from the many amazing results that people are achieving with blockchain, and what they might do with a self sovereign identity secured on a distributed ledger""  Ongoing research by BRI on the impact of blockchain technology to society is supported by leading corporations and government agencies such as Microsoft, IBM, the Bank of Canada and more recently, Salesforce.  In February, it was reported that BRI would be taking on a new project with one of India's leading tech industry organizations to help developers in the country learn more about the use cases of blockchain technology and spur forth stronger digital economies.

In a judgement made on July 31 and released on Thursday, an intermediate Beijing court upheld a decision made by a district court early this year that a bitcoin trader named Li Jianfeng must return the proceeds he received from selling five bitcoins he obtained by accident.  The case reportedly stemmed from a system bug on a then China-based bitcoin exchange named Coinnice, which issued the bitcoins to Li on March 10, 2017.  Based on the court document, Li subsequently liquidated the bitcoins for around $6,100. After Li declined Coinnice's request that he return the funds, the company brought a lawsuit against him in a Beijing district court.  During the case, Coinnice argued that Li had no legal right to possession of the assets and, as such, should return the proceeds to the exchange.  The plaintiff further presented the bitcoin address that was assigned to Li on the exchange, proving the transactions to the court. The judge consequently ruled in favor of the plaintiffs in March 2018, saying that by signing up on Coinnice, Li agreed by default to the contractual terms listed on the platform.  However, Li later appealed to the intermediate court making the counter-argument that Coinnice was based in China and should have been be regarded as an illegal operation to begin with, since the People's Bank of China has explicitly prohibited bitcoin trading platforms from providing services to domestic investors. At the time of the incident, though, there was no such ban.  The judge in the appeal ruled that, based on China's civil law, anyone that has made profits without legal grounds and caused loss to other people must return the unauthorized assets.  The court went to explain:  ""In this case, whether or not Coinnice's establishment as a bitcoin trading platform has violated relevant rules, does not have any impact on Li's liability to return the profits he received with no legal basis. ... As such, the court denies his appeal and the decision is final.""  Although codified statutes predominate in China's civil law system, the judgement may still offer a window into the thinking of courts in the country when dealing with disputes involving cryptocurrencies.  In a similar case, crypto exchange OKEx is also facing a lawsuit in which a bitcoin trader is claiming for 38 bitcoin cash that he did not receive after the cryptocurrency's hard fork from bitcoin in August 2017. The divergence meant that anyone with bitcoins at the time would, in theory, also own the new bitcoin cash to an equal amount. However, not all exchanges passed the free coins onto customers.

Called ""proof-of-authority,"" the mechanism notably replaces the proof-of-work mining process that is common in public blockchains. However, it is only applicable in a permissioned network scenario – that is, on private or consortium blockchains where only invited parties may participate as nodes, Azure software engineer Cody Born wrote in a post on Tuesday.  The addition of proof-of-authority allows Azure's institutional clients to verify transactions more efficiently and maintains high levels of security, Born said, although ""the underlying ether has no value.""  He explained:  ""An alternative protocol, Proof-of-Authority, is more suitable for permissioned networks where all consensus participants are known and reputable. Without the need for mining, Proof-of-Authority is more efficient while still retaining Byzantine fault tolerance.""  Proof-of-authority consensus essentially requires the presence of invited parties as a proof of their participation in the decentralized network.  To that effort, the post said the mechanism allows ""each consensus participant to delegate multiple nodes to run on their behalf"" – the goal being to ensure that even if one node goes down, a consensus authority can still maintain its presence on the network.  It should be noted that proof-of-authority is not new, and was first conceived by developers from ethereum client Parity. It has also been deployed on the VeChain blockchain.  The addition follows Microsoft's May launch of the Azure Blockchain Workbench – a tool designed to streamline the process for enterprises building decentralized applications on the cloud computing platform.

Revealed Wednesday, the companies have already signed up 94 firms for the platform since it was spun off from Maersk in January. They have also finally given it a name: TradeLens.  Leveraging Maersk's leviathan-like scale, TradeLens has attracted a wide variety of entities, ranging from dozens of port operators and customs authorities to logistics companies and even rival ocean-going carriers, such as Pacific International Lines, all of whom have been testing the platform.  The pilot stage now complete, TradeLens is available for participation through an early adopter program and is expected to be fully commercially available by the end of this year.  And to drive home the message that TradeLens is an open and neutral platform, IBM and Maersk have updated their marketing strategy, now describing the project as ""joint collaboration"" rather than a joint venture.  ""At the time of the launch, we wanted to be clear that we were not offering a bespoke Maersk- or IBM-only solution,"" Michael White, head of global trade digitization at Maersk, told CoinDesk  While Maersk and IBM remain the only two shareholders, and both invested in the technology and jointly own the IP, White emphasized it is completely open to ecosystem participants.  ""It was never about a joint venture,"" he said, although the Maersk press release for the launch described it as such.  But an IBM spokesperson said the original 49/51 percent ownership split will no longer apply under the collaboration model the two are now going to market with, in response to feedback from the industry.  Both IBM and Maersk will sell access to the TradeLens platform. The selling party will contract with the customer and receive all the fees and revenue rather than sharing it with the other partner, the IBM representative added.  This new model allows them to bring the solution to market faster, and be more flexible than the previously planned joint venture model, the spokesperson said.  Common tongue  TradeLens is built on the IBM Blockchain platform, which uses the open source relative of Linux, Hyperledger Fabric, and this presents a possible interplay with other IBM and Hyperledger projects.  ""We have architected all of these solutions so that it's very easy for data to be exchanged between the two different blockchains – take TradeLens and IBM Food Trust for example – if clients were to be inclined,"" said Todd Scott, the vice president of global trade at IBM Blockchain.  To help foster this open supply chain ecosystem, TradeLens is pushing its open APIs for shipping as well as work being done with shipping standards bodies such as CEFACT and industry groups such as OpenShipping.org.  ""On top of the bedrock of blockchain technology we are working with standards, and also have 125 or so APIs, and we are going to give all that access to the developer community so they can even create additional technologies of their own on top of it, "" said Scott.  However, not everyone will see this as such a great and gregarious invitation to the industry.  ""It's fine for them [IBM and Maersk] to say 'we are open for everyone to join,' but all they are really saying is 'come and use our system,'"" said Sean Edwards, chairman of the International Trade and Forfaiting Association.  Edwards, who is also head of legal at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation Europe, said getting everybody to speak together is not a new problem and the answer, he said, has been to try and create ecosystems like Universal Trade Network (UTN), only they haven't really got off the ground yet.  Referring to other blockchain solutions aimed specifically at banks to optimize trade finance (which is related to but different than the supply chain processes TradeLens is digitizing), Edwards said the situation may become one where, just as consumers have a multiplicity of passwords and systems that we use, banks and other entities may have to be present on a number of different platforms.  ""Either there are common enough standards that all the different underlying technologies can actually speak to each other, or you have initiatives that are so big everybody uses it,"" said Edwards, adding:  ""I don't think somebody like Maersk is going to solve that.""  Courting HSBC  And notably, TradeLens is not the only boat in this race.  In addition to the well-established supply chain payments platform TradeShift, which connects over 1.5 million companies across 190 countries, banking giant Citigroup is in stealth with a combined trade finance and supply chain platform which will leverage not only distributed ledger technology (DLT) but also the internet of things (IoT) and artificial intelligence.  Hence, TradeLens is at pains to come across as neutral and therefore appeal to the widest possible audience.  Speaking to potential data privacy concerns for companies that compete with Maersk's subsidiaries, White said the Maersk side of the collaboration team is a distinct and separate entity with no involvement with the commercial activities of either Maersk Line (the shipping container business) or Damco (the logistics provider).  On top of these Chinese walls, the platform itself features privacy protections, White said. ""Sensitive information from other carriers are kept on separate nodes, so Carrier A cannot see Carrier B 's information or carrier C's information,"" he said.  Looking ahead, another possible blockchain interoperability play for TradeLens would be some of the trade finance blockchain platforms built on IBM Blockchain and Hyperledger, such as we.trade and Batavia.  Although it's probably still rather far off in the future, you could imagine an all-encompassing platform, so that if radio frequency identification (RFID) trackers indicate physical proximity to something, a payment can be released or a document signed, or similar.  On the subject of trade finance, IBM said banks were present among the 92 TradeLens pilot partners, but these were not being named. However, CoinDesk learned from a source in the trade finance arena that HSBC has ""met with TradeLens a couple of times and agreed to reconnect post-launch.""  And both IBM and Maersk agreed a world of opportunity awaits with regard to bringing trade finance banks, marine insurers and the like on to TradeLens as the platform takes to the waves.  Maersk's White concluded,  ""We have found is there are number of industries and institutions including financial institutions and insurance companies, that are looking to take advantage of this platform.""

42401768,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2M1Q,1533812402,Bitcoin Price Looks to Defend $6K as Sell-Off Slows,"Bitcoin (BTC) could defend the immediate support of $6,000 in the short-term as the recent sell-off is looking overstretched on the technical charts.  The world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization fell for the third straight day on Wednesday to hit a three-week low of $6,121 on Bitfinex and was last seen trading at $6,320 – down 26 percent from the July 24 high of $8,507.  Notably, almost half of the 26 percent drop witnessed over the last two weeks has happened in the last 48 hours, likely indicating investors have been left unimpressed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC's) decision to postpone any action regarding a bitcoin ETF proposal from VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust.  So, there is little likelihood of the bulls making a strong comeback in the short-term. Even so, the bears look to be reaching a point of exhaustion, having engineered a near 90-degree sell-off in the last two weeks.  The technical charts are also indicating the bitcoin market is nearing oversold conditions. As a result, we could be in for a bout of consolidation or a minor corrective rally.  Daily chart  As the above chart shows, BTC convincingly closed (as per UTC) below the ascending trendline yesterday, boosting the odds of a further sell-off.  The cryptocurrency has also found acceptance below $6,344 (78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from $5,755 to $8,507), which only adds to the overall bearish tone of the market.  Hence, a drop to $6,000 (psychological support) cannot be ruled out, although the bearish momentum is likely to wane as the relative strength index (RSI) is closing on the oversold territory (below 30.00).  Further, the short-duration charts are reporting oversold conditions.  4-hour chart  The RSI on the 4-hour chart fell back below 30.00 (oversold levels) and hit the lowest level since June 22 earlier today, meaning the cryptocurrency is at its most oversold in seven weeks. This also backs up the likelihood of a brief rally or period of consolidation ahead.  However, the sustainability of the gains is under question as the 50-candle MA has crossed the 200-candle MA from above (bearish crossover). More importantly, the stacking order of the three major MAs (50-candle below 100-candle below 200-candle) is a classic bearish indicator.  What's more, the 5-day and 10-day MAs continue to slope downwards in a bear-friendly manner.  View  The bearish momentum in BTC could wane in the next 24 hours, allowing the cryptocurrency to defend the immediate support of $6,000.  A corrective rally cannot be ruled out but is seen running out of steam around the downward sloping 5-day and 10-day MAs, currently located at $6,660 and $7,000, respectively.  A daily close (as per UTC) above the 10-day MA would weaken the bearish pressure.  Acceptance below $6,000 would shift risk in favor of a drop to $5,755 (June lows) and could be followed by a ""V-shaped"" recovery to current levels as the indicators are flashing oversold conditions.

42429504,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLzBzh,1533807056,GMO's Cryptocurrency Business Made $2.3 Million Profit in Q2,"Japanese IT giant GMO has just reported making an operating profit of 255 million yen (about $2.3 million) for its cryptocurrency business in the second quarter of this year.  The firm released its financial report following an earnings call on Thursday, which indicated that the company's crypto segment made a total of 2.6 billion yen, or $23 million, in net revenue.  The amount generated in the crypto segment was almost equally split between the mining and exchange businesses, which accounted for 47 and 53 percent of the net revenue, respectively.  That said, with operating costs mounting to $21 million in just three months, GMO recorded a relatively small margin of $2.3 million, or 10.95 percent. However, the figure looks more respectable when placed in the context of GMO's net loss of $6.6 million in the first quarter – mainly due to negative revenue suffered by its exchange business in the first two months of this year.  Although GMO didn't provide a breakdown of the operating costs for the crypto segment in Q2, it did indicate that a notable portion arises from the mining side of its business.  ""Although the expansion and mining equipment progressed as planned and recorded sales of 1.2 billion yen, mining profitability declined due to deterioration of the macro environment such as stagnation of bitcoin price as well as the increase of hash rate,"" the report said.  Indeed, according to GMO's latest mining report, dated Aug. 3, the firm appears to have increased its mining capacity in the second quarter. For instance, the company mined 512 bitcoins in the first quarter – less than the 528 bitcoins GMO mined in June 2018 alone.  Notably, those figures come soon after the launch of GMO's own 7nm bitcoin miners, which were touted as having higher hashing power alongside lower electricity demands.  Before now, the only previous profitable quarter for GMO's fledgling crypto business was Q4 2017, a time when bitcoin prices soared to a record high of nearly $20,000.

42429501,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLzBph,1533801607,Barclays Is Pitting Blockchains Against Each Other (For a Cause),"U.K. banking giant Barclays is challenging up-and-coming blockchain coders to help revamp the global derivatives market at a hackathon next month.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, DerivHack will take place simultaneously in London and New York on September 20-21 at Barclays' Rise accelerator spaces. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), Deloitte and Thomson Reuters are co-sponsoring the event.  Those taking part will be asked to apply ISDA's Common Domain Model (CDM), a set of process and data standards, using their choice of distributed ledger technology (DLT) platform, to efficiently model post-trade processing of derivatives contracts.  CDM attempts to harmonize the way data is presented and reported across different firms and platforms. As such, its adoption is widely viewed as a prerequisite for the financial industry to adopt DLT and smart contracts.  One goal of the hackathon is to suss out which of the commonly used enterprise DLT platforms – R3's Corda, Hyperledger Fabric or ethereum – handles derivative life cycle smart contracts most elegantly.  ""It's up to each team to decide what they code on,"" Dr. Lee Braine of the CTO Office at Barclays Investment Bank told CoinDesk, adding that it is a ""good, and genuinely open, question"" which will perform the most efficiently.  ""I think the sort of things that will come out of this hackathon will include exactly that,"" he said.  Braine said, by way of an example, there may be cases where existing blockchain platforms benefit from some enhancements to make them more naturally compatible with the CDM.  Referring to object-oriented computing languages such as Java, which use classes to define data formats and available procedures for a given type or class of object, he said, ""you could imagine this being equivalent to adding some extra classes to raise the level of abstraction closer to that of the CDM.""  Braine pointed out that the CDM, which is all about how you alter the data structure before and after each life cycle event in a trade (such as an amendment, modification or termination of a contract), will give the judges a neat way to assess those solutions.  ""Because it is the ISDA CDM, it will be very clear what are the inputs and expected outputs for each life cycle event – but it will be up to the hackathon coders to implement the smart contracts using a programming language and platform they think is appropriate,"" he said.  Fresh eyes  For ISDA, the hackathon presents an opportunity to get some feedback from members of the industry (and newbies) about the CDM.  ""Following the release of ISDA CDM 1.0, it is important that the model is explored and validated by a broad set of industry participants,"" said Clive Ansell, head of market infrastructure and technology at ISDA.  A key component in the standardization of smart contract-enabled post-trade processing of derivatives are smart oracles which pipe in data to the contacts. Thomson Reuters was the first large industry player to launch a smart oracle back in June 2017 with BlockOne IQ.  ""Making this capability available during the hackathon is a great opportunity to explore the evolution of standards for blockchain-based financial instruments, as they are a much-needed component in shaping the industry's future infrastructure,"" said Sam Chadwick, director of strategy in innovation and blockchain at Thomson Reuters.  Also, the two intensive days will give participants access to derivatives experts providing guidance on applying the ISDA CDM, said Braine, which should be useful whether the team is a fintech startup looking to implement derivatives smart contracts or a group of students looking to build skills and enhance their CVs.  Summing up, Sunil Challa from the business architect team at Barclays said:  ""If the industry is to realize potential efficiencies and reduce costs via the adoption of standards, then there needs to be greater compatibility across different solutions in capital markets.""

42429505,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLzC5h,1533794421,20 Thai Crypto Exchanges Have Applied for New Digital Assets Licenses,"Thailand's new licensing system for firms working with digital assets has seen a flurry of applications from companies seeking to offer token sales and exchange services just weeks after it went into effect, an official has said.  In a news report from Bangkok Post on Thursday, Rapee Sucharitakul, the secretary-general of the Thailand Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), said a total of 20 crypto exchanges had already registered for licenses.  As CoinDesk has previously reported, rules created to regulate ICOs took effect on July 16 after a royal decree was made public in May. As part of the scheme, projects that intend to offer crypto exchange services must also gain approval from the SEC before trading starts.  ""Many companies interested in opening digital asset exchanges have said digital assets and cryptocurrency trading in the Thai market are quite active,"" Sucharitakul said.  In addition, the SEC said around 50 ICOs have expressed interest in becoming registered to conduct compliant token sales in the country.  However, before the SEC can grant licenses to individual projects, it must first select the so-called ""ICO portals"" – online marketplaces where potential ICO issuers can operate their token sales. Sucharitakul said that, out of the five companies that have expressed interest in becoming ICO portals, three have already filed applications.

42429503,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLzC1h,1533787312,"Now a Nearly $1 Billion Blockchain, Tezos Is Slowly Building Up Its Security","The number of Tezos bakers is on the rise.  The protocol's term for a validator (its equivalent of bitcoin's miners), bakers are crucial to ensuring the nascent network's security. And that's all the more necessary given the value of the funds at stake.  Since raising $232 million in 2017, the protocol has had a very bumpy path to getting off the ground. Once live, though, it's become a top 20 blockchain by market capitalization, with a valuation consistently above $1 billion. Furthermore, there's been little out of the ordinary happening on the new blockchain.  Watching the amount of tokens staked to validate and the number of people taking part is probably the best way early on to assess the stability of the new network.  ""I've been particularly impressed with the role the community has played in this process,"" Mike Reinhart of Obsidian Systems, which is building software for bakers, told CoinDesk in an email.  So far, it's been a smooth increase in bakers overall.  There are 108 bakers working on Tezos, as of this writing, besides the nodes run by the Tezos Foundation, according to TzScan.io, a block explorer for the protocol. At launch, all validation was run by the Tezos Foundation, but that opened up with the seventh cycle (each cycle runs roughly every three days).  This is only the third week that the protocol has been operational. It's difficult to draw any big conclusions from either the limited growth or the limited attrition so far.  But the number seems to be growing as services come along to make it easier for holders of XTZ to participate. It takes 10,000 XTZ to serve as a baker (what the creators call a ""roll""), plus a little technical know-how and a good internet connection.  At current prices, that's roughly $15,000 in cryptocurrency, but if the holder has a long position in tezos, then baking gives them a way to earn additional income while they sit on their tokens.  The number of rolls staked for baking has been increasing steadily as well, helped in part by the growth in delegation services. For holders that don't have $15,000 in cryptocurrency to dedicate to baking, the protocol also allows for users to delegate their tokens to a service in order to earn rewards. TzScan lists 36 companies that offer baking services so far.  It also shows three bakers that have already dropped out of providing delegation services: TZ Baker, Tezos MX and, most recently, XTEZ.  Fear of a centralized protocol  Still, two bakers on the platform represent about 20 percent of all the staked XTZ.  On the other hand, the foundation's nodes have already dropped to less than 50 percent of the total network. In the current cycle, the other 107 bakers make up 32.8 percent of the xtz staked for validation.  However, due to the way delegation on Tezos works, there's a delay from when a user decides to delegate tokens and when they really start working. Tzscan makes it possible to look several cycles ahead, and five cycles down the road, at cycle 17, (about 15 days away) those large delegation services are losing market share.  ""First, they've shown a strong inclination to bake themselves: 46 percent (202/435) of all potential bakers in cycle 17 have only one-to-two rolls,"" Obsidian's Reinhart told CoinDesk.  Obsidian Systems makes secure software for secure baking, with support from the Tezos Foundation. It's currently command line only software, but a graphical user interface is in the works.  It's not the only member of the community to do so. Stephen Andrews has also built BakeChain, free software for Windows computers available on Github.  Nevertheless, there are those who suspect the current architecture will tend toward centralization. Meltem Demirors of CoinShares, has critiqued the concentration of xtz among the very largest holders.  ""There are a number of new services springing up, but we see the trend moving towards consolidation which is concerning,"" Demirors, who is a partner with a delegation service called Tezzigator, told CoinDesk.  Delegation ain't easy  ""What we're seeing is people beginning to grasp the real implications of being an aggregator of proxy votes – it's expensive and only works at scale,"" Demirors argued.  The delegates that have dropped out haven't provided a lot of visibility into their reasoning, but one company providing the service offered its perspective on the challenges of the business.  Awa Sun Yin of Switzerland-based Cryptium Labs has 47 rolls in its baking node, as of this writing. Sun Yin identified three categories of challenges faced by a new delegation service, not all of which might be obvious out the outset. She broke them down into legal, infrastructure and development categories.  Not every new delegator might immediately realize that it's better to establish a legal entity. Once they have, that might persuade some to pull out.  Here in the early days of Tezos, she also pointed out that there's a lot of software updates to the protocol coming quickly that delegation services have to keep up with. Couple this with the fact that there aren't enough open source tools to automate all processes that could be automated for a delegator yet.  ""The biggest struggle with maintaining the baking infrastructure is related to software upgrades,"" she wrote. ""These releases are hard to foresee and sometimes the releases are critical, as they might have patched a security vulnerability.""  In other words, it's just not as easy as setting up some code on a computer and letting it run.  That said, she added:  ""As the technology has been recently launched, there is a lot of room for both development and community contributions. With time, and the right participation, it will get much better.""

42429510,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLzCFh,1533780001,Intuit Scores Patent for Processing Bitcoin Payments With Text Messages,"California-based business and financial software company Intuit has been awarded a patent for processing bitcoin payments via text message.  The patent, published by the U.S Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) on Tuesday, details how a system of virtual accounts could enable two users to transfer funds using mobile phones. The company first filed the patent in 2014, shortly after it launched its QuickBooks Bitcoin Payments service, a bitcoin transaction processor which small businesses could use to accept bitcoin in lieu of fiat currencies.  As the application states:  ""The invention relates to a method for processing payment. The method includes receiving, by a payment service from a payer mobile device of a payer, a payment text message comprising a payment amount and an identifier of a payee mobile device.""  It goes on to explain that validation of a payment text message would be done in a number of different ways.  One requires sending through ""a password request associated with an account of the user"" in order to process payment. Another takes into account the use of voicemail as further validation by sending through ""a voice phone call [that] is automatically disconnected by the payment service without answering.""  Such unanswered voice calls would act as confirmation of all credible payment texts aimed at distinguishing from the potential threat of ""random message or spam message sent by a machine.""  The company has long been looking into improving access to bitcoin payment processors. While it launched QuickBooks in 2014, the company continued developing its payment platform, most recently partnering with payment provider Veem to enable international cryptocurrency payments.
