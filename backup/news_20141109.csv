42377784,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73XNb,1415557920,All Things Alt: Feathercoin Forks and a Collaborative Crowdfund for Charity,"What's happening in the altcoin community this week? Though the market volume doldrums of the past few months don't seem to be clearing away too quickly, development on many projects continues to move forward and the ecosystem diversifies even further.  Read on to see some of the latest happenings from around the altcoin space.  Litecoin and dogecoin team up for charity  A joint effort to raise money ahead of the holiday season is currently underway, combining the crowdfunding capabilities of both the litecoin and dogecoin communities.  The LiteShibes 4 Christmas campaign follows previous efforts to raise money to provide holiday gifts to impoverished children in the Philippines. Organized by several moderators of the dogecoin subreddit, the group – comprised of both dogecoin and litecoin donors and supporters – has raised roughly 290,000 DOGE and 267 LTC. Combined, this amounts to nearly $1,000 that has been raised at press time.  The project represents the latest crowdfunding initiative from the digital currency community. Previous efforts to raise funds for African well projects have been successful, although the debate over using the technology as a vehicle for donations continues today.  The organizers said in a message on the dogecoin subreddit that the effort is the first joint donation drive since dogecoin instituted auxiliary proof-of-work and merge mining with litecoin began.  “This is a milestone in crypto history, to show that we can bridge the gap between communities to really make a difference and help those less fortunate,” the organizers wrote.  Feathercoin hardforks to new mining algorithm  Late last month, feathercoin officially switched over to NeoScrypt, a new type of memory-intensive hashing algorithm that supporters say will protect the coin from the influence of ASIC miners.  The move, announced at the beginning of the summer, comes amid both the broadening deployment of second-generation scrypt ASICs and a shift away from coin projects based on litecoin’s approach. According to a post on the official feathercoinhttps://forum.feathercoin.com/index.php?/topic/7856-feathercoin-0870-released-the-neoscrypt-update-hardfork-block-432000/ forum, founder Peter Bushnell outlined why the team wanted to push out the new algorithm.  Beyond the risk of network disruption by big mining players with ASICs, Bushnell noted that the project benefits in the long-run by taking proactive steps to stem future issues:  “As the majority of people buying Scrypt ASICs are not doing so to mine feathercoin and the fact that some very large ASIC suppliers will be releasing products soon it seems sensible to move algorithm now before we face the challenges that hit many SHA-256 alts when the SHA-256 ASICs hit. We are moving to a new tier of hashing where feathercoin can be the leading coin.”  As outlined in the NeoScrypt press release, the algorithm seeks to make it economically impractical to develop mining products that can generate large hash rates. Other algorithms like X11 and Scrypt-N seek similar aims, although some reports indicate that ASICs for these algorithms are in the process of being developed and built.  Strange alt of the week  The rising tide of scamcoins and pump-and-dump schemes has led to suggestions that altcoin investors need to be more proactive in their research, scrutinizing of new coin launches and, in general, more careful about what they do.  Despite the risks, some continue to invest in coin launches and initial coin offerings that carry all the warning signs, including inflated returns and unrealistic expectations of public acceptance. Other initiatives that can be seen, like rektcoin, go in the opposite direction and make no bones about the risks involved.  With the slogan “Got rekt? Get rekt!”, rektcoin previously sought to serve as an example of why investors need to be better at what they do. After an initial hype period, the price of rektcoin has collapsed, with the developer suggesting on The Bitcoin Talk Forum that such an outcome was not only expected, but intended.  Claiming they lost money in the process, which began with a high-volume mining launch that saw as much as 35 GH/s in hashing power, the developer said that those who bought in were likely aware that they might be left holding the bag, so to speak:  “All bagholders just bought rektcoin and hoping for a pump and quick profit, just like all other shitcoins you are buying: it doesn't matter what the coin brings....you are just hoping for a whale who will pump it and you can make a quick profit. I guess no whale pumped rekt so you all got rekt! Including us!”  At press time, the price of REKT is down roughly 75% from 24-hour highs. Some investors have taken to social media, noting wryly that the project, for better or for worse, has at least lived up to its name.    $Rekt keeps rekking people, lol. Finally a coin that delivers as promised.      — Dennis (@Dennahz) November 8, 2014    Have a tip about a notable happening in the altcoin world? Email CoinDesk at stan@coindesk.com.

42377768,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73X4j,1415550413,French Regulators Focus On Bitcoin's Risks Instead of Its Rewards,"A conference on the challenges arising with the emergence of new payment services and digital currencies was held last week in Paris by the Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution (ACPR). The goal of the conference was to clarify the regulatory body’s stance on licensing and reporting requirements faced by businesses in new payment services.  ACPR, which can be translated as 'French Prudential Supervisory Authority', monitors the activities of banks and insurance companies in France. It is directly linked to the country’s central bank, la Banque de France, with its president being the central bank’s governor.  France is famous for its risk aversion when it comes to innovation. Despite this, quite a few positive things have happened in the country around bitcoin, both in terms of business and regulations. Unfortunately, this particular conference wasn’t in line with this positive trend.  The ups and downs of bitcoin  Quite a few events this year have shown a positive trend in the French bitcoin sphere: the French Senate held hearings on bitcoin in January, which were followed in July by the publication of a report on the subject. The report underlined the digital currency’s risks, its “volatility, its anonymity and its lack of legal guarantee”, but also acknowledged bitcoin’s potential benefits and opportunities as a “payment system and ... a decentralised validation protocol”.  In terms of VAT taxation, the Ministry for the Economy and Finance announced a threshold on the margin tax of €5,000, so people can “try, invest and develop business with bitcoin” before the French government taxes it.  In May, the first European bitcoin center, la Maison du Bitcoin, opened its doors in Paris. Its inauguration was closely followed by a hackathon sponsored by Coinbase and Paymium – a French bitcoin company offering an exchange, wallet and merchant tools.  Paymium signed its first major merchant deal in September with showroomprive.com, a major online fashion retailer, which became the largest European merchant to accept bitcoin.  But a few events introduced worrisome elements that are very specific to France and its famous “principe de précaution” (precautionary principle): any new and unknown innovation is harmful until proven otherwise or made inoffensive enough by authorities.  One example of this was the closure of an illegal bitcoin exchange in July. The problem doesn’t lie in the shutdown of an illegal platform potentially laundering money, but in the police report that was released following the operation. According to this report, bitcoin and digital currencies are very likely to spark criminal activity because of “the lack of transparency around their existence and their functioning” and “the absence of regulation by the actors of the monetary market”.  Interestingly, these two bitcoin attributes that encourage criminal activity can be argued as a double-edged sword: bitcoin is indeed complex, but all the information required to understand it is available online, and its use as a currency is far more transparent than cash, as most transactions are available for anyone to see on its public ledger.  France will follow the EBA’s report  This report was followed by last week's ACPR conference. M. Jean-Claude Huyssen, director of licensing, authorizations and regulations, confirmed that France is following the European Banking Authority (EBA)’s recommendations issued in July.  One point the EBA made clear in its report is that the regulatory body is aware it needs to develop a “substantial body of regulation,” which is going to take some time. In the meantime, its immediate response is to “discourage credit institutions, payment institutions and e-money institutions from buying, holding or selling virtual currencies”.  During his speech Huyssen presented a slideshow, which mentions 70 risks associated with bitcoin, as listed by the EBA, and the mere possibility of a single benefit – lower transaction costs.  While the EBA analyzed both the risks and opportunities presented by digital currencies, Huyssen focused merely on the risks.  It seems reasonable for ACPR to assess bitcoin from a risk perspective, as its goal is to protect consumers and companies alike, but to be complete, this analysis needs to be balanced with the opportunities bitcoin can create: potentially new businesses and economic activities. In this regard, Huissen’s presentation lacked objectivity in its rendering of the EBA report.  Added to this lack of objectivity is the non-existent communication with bitcoin industry experts who could actually offer an informed view to regulators on what bitcoin truly is at its core.  Before Huyssen’s presentation, a short video of entrepreneurs building businesses in these new finance innovation domains was played. In this video, Gonzague Grandval, Paymium’s CEO, had the opportunity to ask the ACPR to clarify certain points. However, none of Gonzague’s questions were answered during the conference.  The European Bank Authority has yet to issue long-term regulatory guidance, which would be a helpful next step in assessing the legal environment of bitcoin in France with more clarity.

42377766,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73X0x,1415545232,How Can We Make Bitcoin Mainstream?,"All of the writing seems to be on the wall.  Bitcoin now has PayPal integration and dedicated global banking to go along with its natty logo. Regulators are taking notice of it, and noted retailers are accepting it.  If you think bitcoin is mainstream, though, think again. According to an analysis earlier this year, there were only 1.2 million bitcoin addresses holding anything other than dust as of February.  Even its advocates admit that it has a long way to go. Curtis Fenimore's attempt to promote bitcoin to the masses has stalled. Bitcoin Bigfoot, his grassroots effort to get posters and other materials promoting bitcoin out into the community, ""hasn't been all that active or relevant lately,"" he admitted.  Fenimore raised all of the bitcoins for his public awareness effort when the price was over $700. Then, he spent the funds on Bitcoin Bigfoot after the price fell under $700. It was just the luck of the draw.  In the meantime, many people are still blissfully unaware of bitcoin. ""We still have a very long way to go in absolute terms,"" he suggested.  The perception problem may have more to do with depth than breadth. Bitcoin entrepreneur Erik Voorhees argued that around half the people he spoke to are aware of bitcoin, but only a small fraction understand it.  This is normal and expected, said Voorhees:  ""Both the Internet and Paypal had a long period where people heard of it and sort of knew what it was, before they really tried it out.""  Conquering the learning curve  How will the understanding of bitcoin grow among the masses that have heard of it, but know little about it? We're still in the speculation phase, where people hope to make a fast buck. This early, immature phase could work to the cryptocurrency's advantage, said Voorhees.  Successive price bubbles create an effect called the 'tide theory'. When prices spike, people wake up, smelling a potential money-making opportunity, and flock to bitcoin hoping for profit. That may be a short-term reaction, but it sparks a new wave of user adoption.  When the price slumps again, many of the people who arrived in that wave will slide away, but some will stay. Those remaining will have gained a deep understanding of bitcoin and its technology. With each successive bubble, the pool of adopters that continue to use the payment network increases.  Where's the motivation?  What about those people who aren't investors? Like, say, the significant proportion of Americans living paycheck to paycheck? The bitcoin community faces multiple challenges getting these people interested.  Disregarding those political and ideological arguments that are difficult to communicate to exhausted parents working three jobs, one challenge is the 'why should I use it' problem. Many people are still wedded to credit and debit cards, or simple cash, and don't yet see the benefits of an alternative.  ""There are lots of use cases for bitcoin, but nothing yet that has captured the imagination of the general public, there hasn't really been the 'killer app,'"" admitted Voorhees.  Newly-appointed Bitcoin Foundation executive director Patrick Murck says that those applications are appearing.  Murck said:  ""Blockchain-based products are starting to emerge that solve real problems for people, that will drive adoption and grow the pie for the whole bitcoin community.""  All of this assumes that the average Joe or Jane understands what the blockchain is, or how to use a wallet. That's a work in progress, according to 'bitcoin Jesus' Roger Ver.  ""Bitcoin wallets are tolerable for techies to use today, but easier and safer designs are needed to help drive mass adoption,"" he said. ""Companies like Blockchain, Mycelium, and Bread Wallet are hard at work on this.""  Bad press  Bitcoin's road to mainstream adoption may also be hindered by some of the bad press it has received. Lots of people are still convinced that bitcoin went bankrupt back in February, mused Voorhees, arguing that the Mt Gox debacle was ""a huge net negative"" for bitcoin. The biggest problem was the reputational damage that it caused in the media, he said.  ""Because of poor reporting by the media, many people conflate Mt Gox with bitcoin itself,"" added Ver. ""This is a huge problem that needs to be corrected."" Headlines like ""Bitcoin goes bust"" and ""The end of bitcoin"" are good examples of misguided and reputation-damaging press for the digital currency.  Others will focus on the scandal surrounding Silk Road, rather than on bitcoin's benefits.  Silk Road may in the long run be good for bitcoin adoption, say commentators. Voorhees argued that it helped to bootstrap the bitcoin network's commercial use in the early days. Fenimore is convinced that Ulbricht's drug trafficking site helped to demonstrate bitcoin's capabilities as a value transfer system – and that its subsequent takedown confirmed bitcoin's legitimacy for many.  Public misconceptions of bitcoin won't disappear overnight, even if mainstream media outlets correct them. Instead, Fenimore consigns the uninformed to the 'late adopter' category which will be led to bitcoin gradually, as the opportunities emerge. This group of people won't adopt until they can be shown that doing so is significantly cheaper than being a non-adopter.  Promoting a decentralised concept  One of bitcoin's biggest strengths is its grassroots support. This is also one of its weaknesses, though, because it lacks a coherent narrative, which makes it difficult to present a single, strong message in the same way that, say, PayPal's founders did.  Voorhees concluded:  ""Ultimately we just have to accept that bitcoin won't get popular on the back of a slick corporate media campaign over five years. It will get popular person by person, in a messy, organic process.""  That doesn't mean that the community can't organise to help it on the way. What is the single, biggest thing that the bitcoin community can do to make the cryptocurrency mainstream? CoinDesk's interviewees all had different ideas.  Murck argued that funding core development was crucial. Voorhees wanted more remittance providers with larger marketing budgets. Ver suggested integrating bitcoin more closely with the financial markets, while Fenimore said that ""the biggest thing is the aggregate of all the small things"".  Is there one thing that you think will spur bitcoin to mainstream adoption? Let us know in the comments below.
