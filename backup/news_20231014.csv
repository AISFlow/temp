18832734,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=555407,1697324438,Crypto Analyst: Bitcoin To Surpass Gold And Silver Within A Decade,"On Tuesday, an anonymous crypto analyst from a popular YouTube channel InvestAnswer shared more light on the future of Bitcoin. The analyst revealed that Bitcoin (BTC) is set to surpass both Gold and Silver in market capitalization in no more than a decade. BTC Is A Safer Haven Than Gold And Silver Over the years, Bitcoin has been regarded as digital gold due to the fact that the cryptocurrency offers the same benefits as gold with even additional features. In times of economic and political turbulence, BTC has been seen as a safe haven. In the YouTube video, the crypto analyst was able to highlight the underlying difference between Bitcoin and Gold, since Silver is no longer a safe haven and gold has been a more reliable precious metal than Silver. Related Reading: What To Expect If Historical Bitcoin Halving Cycles Repeat According to the crypto analyst, there has been distraught among the crypto community on the idea of whether the paper versions of gold and Bitcoin can change their real-world prices and potential price manipulations by financial giants such as JPMorgan and Blackrock. However, the analyst was kind to shed more light on the growing issue in the YouTube video. He said, “For gold, it’s impossible to know if there is a gold backing to the paper that exists, which makes things very risky. On the other hand with Bitcoin, it’s much easier to prove and check making it much more trustworthy.” In addition, the analyst stated that he strongly believes that Bitcoin will surpass Gold in 8-10 years, not just because of the preceding reasons but because the cryptocurrency can be so easy to verify. “Believe me, forget the other 20 advantages that Bitcoin has over gold. I believe Bitcoin will smash gold performance over the next 8 to 10 years because you can verify. Therefore, I know a lot of people are worried about paper and manipulation by the JPMorgan and the BlackRocks of the world but they can’t because it can be so easily verified.” he stated. Another crypto analyst David Waugh, the lead analyst of Coinbits, has also backed the cryptocurrency. According to the analyst, Bitcoin’s technological developments make it a superior asset over gold. He further added that the crypto’s improvements in divisibility, portability, durability, verifiability, and scarcity make the digital asset a more efficient and reliable store of value. Bears gaining upper hand over bulls | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Grayscale Bitcoin ETF Approval Sparks Momentum Recently, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been given less than a day to file an appeal on the Grayscale plan to convert GBTC into a Bitcoin ETF or will be forced to approve the company’s plan. Related Reading: Man Makes A Fortune With $22 In Bitcoin: 3 Altcoins For October 2023 That Can Do This If the SEC fails to file an appeal before the end of the day, it could spark a possible bullish run in the crypto market as it means it is not contesting Grayscale’s win. Currently, Grayscale owns a significant amount of BTC, which it holds in trust and offers investors shares of the cryptocurrency as GBTC. If the company wins the case with the SEC, it could signal a possible bullish run for Bitcoin.

18826212,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=555425,1697313617,"Road To $1? Analyst Forecasts 1,500% Price Rally For Dogecoin","Recently, the price of Dogecoin (DOGE), the largest meme coin by market cap, has struggled alongside the general cryptocurrency market. However, the latest price action displays an exciting and positive outlook for the cryptocurrency. Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently shared a fresh insight on Dogecoin, speculating on a forthcoming price rally for the meme token. The Dogecoin Descending Triangle Formation Ali Martinez – via a post on the X (formerly Twitter) platform – put forward a $1 price target for Dogecoin. This price projection revolves around the multi-year descending triangle formation on DOGE’s weekly price chart. The descending triangle is a prominent technical analysis pattern that indicates a bearish market trend. Although it is often a bearish sign that suggests a downward trend breakout, it can also be a significant reversal pattern. In this particular scenario, the Dogecoin price has been in a continuous downward trend since May 2021. Prior to this sustained bearish run, the cryptocurrency had enjoyed a parabolic climb, with the price of DOGE claiming the $0.7 level (an all-time high) in April 2021. Related Reading: Bitcoin Path To $70,000? Analyst Shows What This ‘Head And Shoulders’ Pattern Reveals As already inferred, this positive run was short-lived, with the meme coin dropping to a low of $0.058 in October 2022. While the Dogecoin price has momentarily touched the $0.1 mark a couple of times since then, it currently trades in a range – and around the same $0.058 price. In the highlighted weekly chart, DOGE’s price is approaching the apex of the descending triangle pattern. Based on this formation, Martinez foresees a significant bullish run for Dogecoin if a weekly candlestick closes above $0.0835. According to the analyst, this fresh bull run could see the meme coin’s value skyrocket to as high as $1, implying a significant 1,580% rally from the current price point. Watch Out For This Level, Analyst Says While the chances of a new bull run seem strong for Dogecoin, the possibility of a fall still lurks. Specifically, Ali Martinez touted $0.0482 as a price level to look out for. Related Reading: Analyst Expects The Worst For Bitcoin: Will Bears Force Prices To $17,000? This price zone, which is at the base of the descending triangle, represents a significant support zone. The analyst said any weakness around this area could cause the DOGE price to reach a new yearly low. As of this writing, Dogecoin is valued at $0.059329, reflecting a 1.7% price jump in the past day. According to CoinGecko data, the meme token’s daily trading volume stands at $163.3 million, representing a negligible 0.2% increase in the past day.

This development comes amidst fears of the defunct crypto exchange liquidating a substantial portion of its SOL holdings and inducing a bearish trend. FTX Renews Bullish Interest In Solana With Latest Move On October 14, blockchain tracking platform Whale Alert reported that 5.5 million SOL had been transferred between two unknown wallets. Thereafter, a crypto analyst with the X username ashpool soon identified the FTX exchange to be behind this whale transaction. Using data from gelato.sh, ashpool revealed that the FTX exchange had delegated the said 5.5 million SOL to the Figment staking service, an active validator on the Solana network. In September, the management of the bankrupt crypto exchange obtained court approval to liquidate its crypto holdings, valued at $3.4 billion, as they look to pay off their creditors. Solana accounts for the largest part of FTX’s crypto assets, with the exchange reportedly owning 55.8 million SOL, worth $1.16 billion. However, the majority of this SOL are currently staked, with FTX reportedly having access to 7 million SOL as of September, most of which had been sold off. Related Reading: Cardano, Solana, And Ethereum Under Heat, Data Points To More Trouble For Altcoins On October 6, 9.1 million SOL, worth about $212 million, owned by Alameda Research – FTX’s defunct trading wing – were reportedly unstaked, prompting new fears of market sell-off by the FTX estate. However, FTX’s latest move to stake 5.5 million SOL shows the exchange is holding on to its SOL investments for now, which could be interpreted as a reassuring move for traders with fears of liquidation. Despite its bankrupt status, FTX is still considered a major player in the Solana ecosystem, owning 10% of SOL’s total supply. In addition to its SOL holdings, FTX also owns 20,500 BTC worth $560 million and 112,600 ETH, worth $192 million, among other crypto assets.

Most recently, there were circulating rumors that the defunct exchange could “switch off” the Solana blockchain if it found the need to liquidate the long position of traders. However, these rumors were soon debunked by multiple accounts as fake. In fact, Jacob Creech, Head of Developers at Solana, drew the community’s attention to the fact there is a $400,000 SOL bounty for anyone who can find a “switch off” for the network. At the time of writing, SOL is trading at $21.98, with a 2.34% gain in the last day. Meanwhile, the token’s daily trading volume is up by 10.18% and is valued at $267.07 million.

The token was trading at $4.20 Saturday afternoon, continuing a two-day rally that lifted the governance asset — BOND holders use it to vote on decisions at BarnBridge — to its highest price since May.  The rally began shortly after a BarnBridge insider cleared the way for founders Tyler Ward and Troy Murray “the authority to undertake all actions necessary to comply with the Order” from the SEC, including paying a fine.  A team-linked wallet controlling the project’s single-largest voting position provided the only vote in BarnBridge’s two-day poll on how to proceed.  “Is it in the spirit of crypto that a community binding proposal take effect, because of a 1 of 1 vote? Is this the decentralization we want to see?” said Nelson Rosario, an attorney who specializes in crypto law.

18809761,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=555408,1697286640,Bloomberg Analyst Predicts Likelihood Of A Spot Bitcoin ETF By January 2024,"Following notable changes to the ARK 21Shares Spot Bitcoin ETF application, Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas have predicted that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could approve a fund as early as next year. 90% Chance Of Approval In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Seyffart highlighted his team’s prediction of the 90% chance that a Spot Bitcoin ETF will be approved by Ark Invest’s January 10 deadline. January 10 is the day the SEC is expected to make a final decision (approval or denial) on ARK Invest’s Spot Bitcoin ETF application. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Breaks Down The Factors Behind The Bitcoin Price Decline Their latest prediction comes amid the recent amendment ARK Invest and 21Shares made to their Spot Bitcoin ETF prospectus. These updates include further context to the fund and additional risk disclosures. These analysts believe that this sort of amendment only happens when a fund is on its way to being approved. These Bloomberg analysts had earlier predicted (following Grayscale’s victory) that there was a 75% chance that the pending Spot Bitcoin ETF applications could be approved this year and that the odds would rise to 95% by the end of next year if these funds weren’t approved by then. Eric Balchunas noted on his X platform that Invesco Galaxy had also amended its Spot Bitcoin ETF prospectus following the ARK 21Shares amendment. He stated that he expects other applicants to update their applications soon. This suggests that the SEC could approve all applications simultaneously, similar to what it did with the Ethereum futures ETFs. BTC price looking weak | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Spot Bitcoin ETFs Given Huge Boost Following SEC’s Decision Meanwhile, these Spot Bitcoin ETF applications were given a huge boost following the SEC’s decision not to appeal the court’s ruling in its case against Grayscale. The SEC had until October 13 to appeal the Court of Appeal’s ruling that it had acted arbitrarily and capriciously in disapproving Grayscale’s application to convert its GBTC fund into a Spot Bitcoin ETF. Following its decision not to file an en banc application or appeal to the Supreme Court, Reuters reported that the appeals court is expected to issue a mandate laying out how the SEC could carry out its order, including the Commission reviewing Grayscale’s application again. Related Reading: US Mega Bank JPMorgan Predicts Harsh Drop In This Bitcoin Metric James Seyffart also noted that dialogue between Grayscale and SEC should begin next week. However, it remains uncertain if or when the SEC will approve these applications, especially considering that it has delayed its decision on all Spot Bitcoin ETFs till next year. Bitcoin has reacted positively to the news of the SEC’s decision not to file an appeal, currently trading at around $26,849.76, up in the last twenty-four hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Prince’s appearance provided valuable insights into the intricate relationship between BlockFi, FTX, and Alameda Research. BlockFi’s Bankruptcy Rooted In Alameda And FTX According to a Bloomberg report, Prince revealed that BlockFi had substantial exposure to Alameda and FTX, estimated at around $1 billion, at the time of BlockFi’s failure in November 2022. Prince asserted that if the loans to Alameda were still in good standing and the funds on FTX were available, BlockFi would not have filed for bankruptcy. This statement suggests that BlockFi’s financial troubles were closely tied to the collapse of Alameda and FTX. Related Reading: Have Traders Moved Past Dogecoin? Transactions Plunge 98% Since June Prince’s testimony diverged significantly from Caroline Ellison, the government’s star witness, who portrayed Bankman-Fried as the mastermind behind a fraudulent scheme using FTX customer funds for speculative trading at Alameda. Prince’s account positioned BlockFi as a victim of Bankman-Fried’s alleged schemes, claiming that BlockFi made loans to Alameda based on misleading balance sheets. Defense lawyers sought to emphasize that BlockFi willingly provided the loans to Alameda, with knowledge of the associated risks. Creditors Accuse BlockFi Of Inadequate Due Diligence Prince discussed BlockFi’s due diligence process regarding Alameda’s collateral, comprised of tokens affiliated with FTX. The judge requested plainer terms during Prince’s explanation, prompting an analogy using car loans. Per the report, the prosecution questioned the adequacy of BlockFi’s due diligence, as creditors accused the company of failing to recognize warning signs before offering substantial loans to Alameda. Prince’s testimony highlighted that providing “unaudited balance sheets” is an industry norm for borrowers seeking loans. The defense sought to establish that BlockFi knew the risks of lending to Alameda and acted within industry norms. Zac Prince’s testimony in the trial against Sam Bankman-Fried provided a deeper understanding of the intertwined relationships within the crypto industry. BlockFi’s exposure to Alameda and FTX and its subsequent bankruptcy offered insights into the potential repercussions of alleged fraudulent activities.

As the trial unfolds, the court will continue to examine the details surrounding BlockFi’s lending practices and the extent of Bankman-Fried’s involvement in the alleged schemes. It is important to note that BlockFi can no longer be utilized for crypto-related activities, as the company declared bankruptcy and suspended withdrawals in November 2022. The bankruptcy filing indicates that BlockFi owes between $1 billion and $10 billion to over 100,000 creditors.

Analyst Shows What This ‘Head And Shoulders’ Pattern Reveals","Bitcoin, the leading digital asset in terms of market cap and adoption, recent activity on its price chart has led to speculation and predictions about its future trajectory. Acclaimed cryptocurrency trader, known as Mags on the X (formerly known as Twitter) platform, recently shared his analysis on Bitcoin, suggesting a significant price surge for Bitcoin soon. Related Reading: Will October Be Bitcoin’s Golden Month Again? A Dive Into A Decade Of Bullish Trends The Bitcoin ‘Head And Shoulders’ Insight According to Mags, Bitcoin’s journey to a $70,000 price tag is foreseeable. His deduction stems from observing an inverted ‘Head and Shoulders’ pattern on Bitcoin’s price chart. Notably, this is a predictive tool in technical analysis that indicates potential price reversals based on prior movements. Mags highlighted that Bitcoin’s price is currently at the so-called ‘neckline’ of this pattern. If the pattern holds and Bitcoin breaks out from this neckline, it could be a bullish indicator for the flagship cryptocurrency. #Bitcoin is going to $70,000 ?? BTC is forming a massive Head and Shoulder pattern on the inverted chart price is currently testing the Neckline The Technical target of the pattern, if measured from the neckline, is around $70,000 pic.twitter.com/owLPorGK5j — Mags (@thescalpingpro) October 13, 2023 Mixed Reactions In The Community Sergey Stolyarov, a user on X, expressed skepticism over the said pattern’s significance. In Stolyarov’s view, the construction and structural reasons don’t qualify the observed pattern as a ‘Head and Shoulders.’ Stolyarov added that such formations could be discerned at any time and any part of the Bitcoin chart, implying the ubiquitous nature of pattern formation in volatile markets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Eyes Turnaround: Could A New All-Time High Be On The Horizon? Analyst Predicts Another user criticized Mag’s interpretation of Bitcoin’s price chart, emphasizing that a genuine “Head and Shoulders” pattern exists on the regular chart that predicts a price decline to 20,000. The user noted: nope – bitcoin actually formed a picture head and shoulders on the NOT inverted chart but you were so biased that you have to hunt for head and shoulders that it’s a shitty one on inverted bitcoin chart so you don’t have to look at the head and shoulders. It is also very large and points to a target of 20,000 short term. However, while some users sided with Mags, others took a more critical approach. Resham Singh, another member of the X platform, voiced appreciation for Mags’ analytical approach, deeming it “impressive.” Singh seemed to align with Mags’ projection, hinting that such a price movement would mark a milestone for Bitcoin.
