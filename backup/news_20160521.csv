42426910,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxSJh,1463846257,"Blockchain's Big Innovation is Trust, Not Money","Jason Leibowitz is a former Wall Street professional who pivoted careers in 2014 to focus full-time on digital currency.  In this opinion piece, Leibowitz discusses why the blockchain is now best perceived as an innovation in distributed, digital trust, despite its early connotations with the financial technology space.  It’s been referred to as a ""revolutionary technology"" by IBM, and a ""once in a generation opportunity"" by PricewaterhouseCoopers. But perhaps the most descriptive title came from The Economist when they dubbed blockchain ""the trust machine"".  It is a breakthrough in computer science that holds the promise of reducing the cost of establishing and maintaining trust for both individuals and organizations.  ""Blockchain"" is a relatively new term that refers to a specific type of computer database. The Oxford English Dictionary defines blockchain as ""a digital ledger in which transactions…are recorded chronologically and publicly"". The etymology dates back to 2008 when the creator of the cryptocurrency ""bitcoin"" called its ledger a ""blockchain"", or a chain consisting of blocks of transactions.  Since then, there have been many competing versions and iterations, but most operate on the same premise: they are open-sourced, run 24x7 and continuously update in real-time.  What makes blockchain technology unique and groundbreaking is that it's not controlled by any single entity; instead the ledgers are distributed among all parties involved (also referred to as a ""distributed ledger""). This means that no central party has ownership of the ledger, therefore no one can individually amend the entries already on a blockchain.  This makes the blockchain an immutable store of information.  Removing intermediaries  One of the primary values of blockchains in business is the role they assume by disintermediating middlemen.  Because blockchains are decentralized and immutable, counterparties can independently transact and verify the data on a ledger without the need to hire costly third parties to perform similar tasks. Often the role of third parties is to add trust and integrity to transactions, especially between unknowns.  For example, in real estate transactions, escrow companies act as one of the many third parties who sit between the buyer and seller to collect fees for the service of exchanging funds for documents. On a blockchain, individuals and businesses would be able to transact directly, peer-to-peer.  ""Standard practices that normally involve specialists, like title searches, legal, finance, etc will be less needed or in most cases totally unnecessary. [Using blockchains] the speed to transact will be shortened from days/weeks/months to minutes or seconds”, explains Jason Ray, CTO of the Urban Land Institute, a global real estate body.  The application of this technology in real estate will make waves by increasing transparency, expediting lengthy processes and overall reducing the costs of transacting.  Achieving trust  Over $1bn  of venture capital money has already been invested in blockchain-related companies around the world. Leading-edge businesses and investors across many industries have begun to recognize that this technology holds the key to revolutionizing the way money, assets and securities are transferred, accounted for and reconciled.  The goal is to harness blockchain technology to save time and money for businesses and their customers — the product of which will be increased trust and transparency in many currently opaque industries. One beneficiary will be the financial markets, where the pricing of complex derivative instruments (exotic options on securities, equities and commodities), including those on mortgage-backed securities, contributed to the 2008 financial crisis.  Trust is the key element of blockchain technology. When transactions are executed and settled on a distributed ledger, counterparties don't need to have an established trust relationship. If each participant in the transaction trusts the blockchain itself then they don’t need to directly trust each other. This opens up new avenues of customers for businesses operating on blockchains.  Here is a real-world example in the insurance industry:  SafeShare Global is a modern insurance company that has a unique edge: they employ blockchain technology to offer affordable insurance solutions specifically designed for the sharing economy. Companies such as AirBnB and Vrumi allow users to rent out space to interested parties, however, this means the hosts need to be comfortable letting complete strangers into their homes.  This is where insurance plays an important role: to protect the hosts from potential liabilities. (It is important to note that typical home insurance policies do not cover individuals or families when using residences as unregistered quasi-hotels, which forces space sharing companies to offer their own insurance).  Vrumi, a startup launched in 2014, has partnered with SafeShare Global because they cannot afford to self-insure like some of their competitors. Once a Vrumi host and renter are matched, and the host opts-in for insurance through the website, the material information about the policy gets directly uploaded onto a distributed ledger. At this point all logistics are essentially automated as Vrumi, SafeShare, the underwriter and all other parties involved behind the scenes simultaneously receive and can view the time-stamped information about each policy.  The use of a distributed ledger eliminates the need for these companies to employ labor-intensive middle and back offices to handle the details and coordination of each policy. What differentiates this from a typical database is the immutable and distributed aspect of the ledger. No one can amend or duplicate policy information, otherwise fraudulent policies would immediately be visible by all parties running the ledger.  The transparency of this distributed ledger virtually eliminates fraud, which further reduces the costs of doing business for all parties involved.  Early adopters grow  One of the parties running a node on this ledger is a UK governing body called the States of Alderney. While not necessary, they are adding an air of legitimacy to this pilot insurance program. To be fair, the relevant reason for the government’s involvement is to help protect one of their oldest insurance companies who has taken on the responsibility of underwriting SafeShare’s policies: Lloyd’s of London.  Lloyd’s has been vocal about their willingness to embrace new technologies to help streamline the insurance industry. Its director of operations, Shirine Khoury-Haq, elaborated that ""blockchain has the potential to improve the way insurers record risk, increasing the speed, accuracy and transparency of our processes.""  Lloyd’s recognized that once they approved of the way SafeShare’s distributed ledger operated, they were ready to enter into business with the startup. Expressed differently, Lloyd’s just needed to place trust in the blockchain and not directly in SafeShare itself to enter into this business relationship.  Blockchain technology adds transparency because it is essentially an open window into the inner workings of a business. Without the use of blockchain technology, Lloyd’s would have to trust the methodology in which SafeShare goes about its business, without any direct insight into the integrity of their operations. Blockchain technology reduces the barriers to entry for new market participants like SafeShare because the transparent nature of distributed ledgers means it is much harder for businesses to hide any dubious practices.  The blockchain-inspired relationship between all parties involved in this example is a microcosm of the impact that distributed ledgers will have on the overall economy. Successful new innovations generally save users either time or money, or they add convenience.  Blockchains do all three, and the applications of this technology have only just scratched the surface of their full potential.  Other implementations of the technology are currently found in banking, healthcare, notaries, digital rights, provenance and the Internet of Things. As the reach of blockchain continues to grow, more industries will feel the disruptive impact of this innovation in trust.

42426907,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxSPh,1463845257,The New Banking Standard,"Martin Hagelstrom is a bitcoin enthusiast, project executive and consultant working on IT projects at IBM.  In this op-ed, Hagelstrom touches on the slow but steady embrace of blockchain by the world's banks.  A few months ago I was writing a research paper centered on this question: Is there a use case for private blockchains?  I'll be honest, I started writing it with my conclusions already on mind. I was totally biased.  My thoughts were basically that private blockchains (and the lack of PoW) couldn't offer more security than a distributed database. And at the same time they were pretty limited and based on a much more immature technology.  So, why on earth a bank or any organization would use a private blockchain instead of a well known and proven technology?  Simple answer: fad.  Nevertheless, I did my homework and research into a variety of areas: private blockchain approaches, alternative consensus mechanisms, the economics behind bitcoin security, financial industry pain points, and the inefficiencies on the actual system. I even made a SWOT analysis to compare blockchains and distributed databases.  And then something happened. You should enjoy this, as you won't hear this often from a guy from Argentina.  I was wrong.  First, I was focusing on the wrong kind of problems a blockchain should solve for banks. The possibility of modifying a past record might not be a bug for a bank but a feature. Sure, it should not be easy, but probably neither completely tamper-proof depending on the circumstances.  If they can have a shared ledger to transact between several institutions without the inefficiencies of intermediaries, manual processing and system integration complexity, they will sign up right away. Even if the system is not completely tamper proof, as long as it can be audited, it might be good enough for their purposes.  But why a blockchain?  But I know what you are thinking. They can also do that with a database without the limitations of a blockchain.  And it's true, but I was missing a huge point in this regard. Limitations might be a good thing.  Imagine to seat 30 banks on the same table with a blank page to design the data model of their shared database. Consider that they would all have to change their actual custom developed, 30 year-old core systems, and that alone would cost millions of dollars, if not more.  So you guessed right – they would all try to propose the less impactful design for their organisation and that discussion would likely last for long periods of time, potentially to the point than an agreement is never struck.  But Blockchain limitations and the threat of bitcoin achieved what felt like an impossible task. Banks are moving to agree on a standard: the blockchain standard.  Of course, there are still lots flavors and types of applications to choose from, but for the first time in a very long time we have most of the banks at the same table with a half-done blueprint in front of them.  It remains to be seen if this will lead to a new kind of banking network, or an ""Internet of Banks"" as has been proposed.  Will this new network totally disrupt the current financial system? Of course not. But to be fair, we shouldn't expect disruption from the actual market leaders. That's someone else's job. The fintech and bitcoin startup ecosystem needs to work hard to become the Uber of the financial system.  But, in the meantime, if banks can derive some efficiencies from disintermediation, their customers will likely see some benefit as well.
