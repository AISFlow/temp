42376625,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bThR,1381927248,Bitcoin: the solution to startups' international banking issues?,"Banks and large corporations continue to view the concept of bitcoin as a problem. But for some businesses, virtual currencies can help to alleviate a thorny situation. This can be especially true for startups, which often have to operate by being creative and taking risks in order to survive. When you’re just starting a business, it can be important to think differently.  For the second-hand games and software exchange site Half Price Digital, an interesting legal decision led its founder to register his business in the United Kingdom.  By utilizing bitcoin on the site, users can quickly buy and sell digital goods. Plus, the digital currency has allowed this company to operate despite difficult-to-navigate international banking laws.  UsedSoft v Oracle  A decision in the European Court of Justice (ECJ)'s UsedSoft v Oracle case last year prompted Half Price Digital’s domain and business registration in the UK.  According to this ruling, if you pay a fee for a digital copy of something such as a piece of software and are granted a license for an unlimited period of time, then the copyright owner has exhausted their exclusive rights for distribution.  The bit of legal-ese means that even if a software license that someone purchases in Europe explicitly states that it cannot be resold, the purchaser is still allowed to do so if they wish. This includes both downloaded software as well as physical media.  Half Price Digital’s founder Michael McNeff took that court ruling as an opportunity for people to buy and sell digital goods, including iOS and Android apps. But as a US citizen, he experienced a lot of difficulty obtaining a bank account in the UK to start his website.  While it was easy for him to register as a business there, banks did not want to open an account for a US citizen. In order to accept a large amount of payment transactions via PayPal, its UK subsidiary requires a merchant to at least have a bank account in that country.  Recently tightened US tax reporting regulation has made European banks wary of servicing American customers and McNeff didn’t want to travel to Europe just to open an account, which was something that banks there were requesting from him.  Enter bitcoin  McNeff decided to accept bitcoin on Half Price Digital because he thought it would attract a valuable market: tech-savvy users interested in selling their digital goods.  “My site uses Coinbase as a way for bitcoin users to pay for auctions,” says McNeff. “I chose Coinbase because I needed essentially the PayPal equivalent for bitcoin allowing direct user-to-user payment transfers.”  And instead of having just PayPal for paying auction fees, users have the option to use BTC. Inadvertently, this solved McNeff’s international banking issue while trying to scale his site.  Another advantage to using bitcoin for Half Price Digital is that PayPal cannot influence any legal ramifications of the site. By using bitcoin, the site is keeping at bay any pressure by PayPal to freeze the merchant account even though the court ruling is a clear sign that this type of activity is legal in the European Union. McNeff said:  “I think that in the future many US entrepreneurs will choose to form their companies in the EU to avoid US patent trolls. Patent trolls are a big problem for any US tech company and being outside their reach is a big advantage.”  Buying used Steam games might be another big resale market in the future. There is currently a lawsuit in Europe regarding Valve’s prohibitions on reselling games within its platform.“For some reason with digital content, if you buy it you can't resell it and if you lease it (like having an Adobe Creative Cloud subscription) you also can't resell it [in the US],"" says McNeff.  Half Price Digital is a great example of being able to break down barriers of entry into a market. The resale of digital goods should be something that US consumers probably should have the right to do, and bitcoin is just one a tool that allows the site to be in business.  What other startup-related problems could virtual currencies solve? Do you feel you should be able to resell your digital items?

42376630,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bTnj,1381919424,Crowdcurity brings crowdsourced hacker testing to bitcoin,"Bitcoin websites are prime targets for cyber-attacks. Now, a company called Crowdcurity wants to apply the wisdom of crowds to make them more secure. How will it work?  Protecting against attacks isn’t optional if you want to keep your web-based bitcoin app in business. Bitcoin apps can often hold hundreds in individual coins, leaving their users incurring significant financial losses if they are compromised. This is particularly true in the case of exchanges.  For example, margin-trading site Bitcoinica was sued for $460,000 in 2012 after being hacked twice. US-based exchange BitFloor suffered major embarrassment after 24,000 bitcoins were stolen following a hack in September 2012 – a figure that represented almost ten years of transaction fees. That’s a difficult loss to bounce back from. This isn't the first instance, the problems go back further still: Vicurex saw its wallet compromised in 2011. And these are just examples from a far larger set.  Breaking into a web app  Not all of these bitcoin thefts are explicitly the result of website problems. Some stem from human error, and some are, as yet, unexplained. But one thing is for sure: badly-designed code doesn’t help, and is responsible for at least some of these issues.  How many ways can a person break into a web application? There are tens of them, but the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) breaks them down into ten broad categories. It updates the list each year, and 2013’s makes gruesome reading.  At the top of the list? Injection. This happens when someone injects code that shouldn’t be there into a web application, usually through a parameter passed to a URL. It can be used to execute unintended commands, including putting dangerous malware on a web page to infect visiting machines, or dumping customer details, for example.  Other potential attacks include exploiting poor security configuration (including configuration of hosting servers), and broken authentication, in which sessions are not properly managed, enabling attackers to hijack accounts. Another old chestnut is the cross-site scripting attack, in which bad data is sent to a browser using JavaScript, causing it to misbehave. The fact that these attacks are still possible years after they were first discovered is a discredit to the software development community.  The problem for a lot of software developers in the bitcoin space and elsewhere is that it is difficult to spot all of the bugs. Several bitcoin sites employ ‘bug bounties’ to solve the problem, offering eagle-eyed members of the community rewards to spot and fix problems.  Coinbase has one  , with a minimum payout of 5 BTC, and no maximum payout. At the time of writing, it had awarded bitcoins to 27 people, amounting to at least 135 BTC. Payward, which runs the Kraken margin trading site, is stingier about its bounty program, offering a minimum of a single bitcoin per bug. Another bitcoin trading site, 1Broker, also ran a program.  Enter Crowdcurity  Crowdcurity hopes to standardize the bug bounty concept by outsourcing the process. The online service connects companies that have software to debug with a community of around 250 software testers, which it has found via security forums.  The firm isn’t solely bitcoin focused, as its process can be applied to any web-based application. Nevertheless, it’s an important market for the firm. “Bitcoin companies are already very focused on security and they know that they need to focus on it,” says Jacob Hansen, founder of Crowdcurity, who is already negotiating with at least one large bitcoin-based business. “Traditional e-businesses don’t always have the same awareness.”  [post-quote]  Customers can create a reward program with the site, setting rules and amounts for bug programs. The challenge is then sent to the testing community, which works on reporting vulnerabilities. The customer validates the bugs in conjunction with Crowdcurity, and payouts are awarded based on bug severity.  More than half of the payouts have been made in bitcoins for the single customer that the firm had dealt with as of last week. “Many of these payments may be $25-$50 if the bugs are low criticality, and with bitcoins you have lower fees, and it makes payments faster,” Hansen says.  The site’s testers can target a test site, or an operational site that is already processing live data, Hansen explains. But sites shouldn’t just rely on external testers, he argues.  Crowdcurity is effectively a penetration testing service, in which a crowd of testers tries to hack a website. But what they don’t do is look at a site’s code. In one sense, this is a good thing, because closed source sites won’t want people ogling their intellectual property. In another sense, it leaves the analysis of the code up to the company, which then has to find the skills to do it.  “They should do security reviews of their code internally. Then, there are a lot of automatic tools out there which can look at your code and discover common vulnerabilities.” Crowdcurity uses tools like Brakeman for its own site, which scans for vulnerability in Ruby on Rails apps. There are more for other languages – but companies have to have the skills and discipline to use them.  As bitcoin grows up and companies get better funding, software developers will hopefully be in a better position to cover all of their security bases. And maybe we’ll see fewer disaster stories like Bitcoinica or Bitfloor.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2013/10/16/crowdcurity-brings-crowdsourced-hacker-testing-to-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/283e7b9b0e6ffd0ada4106a01563de86537e0954-1215x768.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
