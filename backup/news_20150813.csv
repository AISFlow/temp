42398596,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbcHHg,1439504454,ItBit Reveals Bankchain Project Won't Use Bitcoin,"ItBit has revealed new details about its formerly top-secret Bankchain project, a private consensus-based ledger system aimed at appealing to enterprise financial institutions.  With the formal unveiling, the New York-based bitcoin exchange has joined the number of blockchain firms seeking to compete for the attention of banks that want to utilize the efficiencies of distributed databases without using bitcoin or its blockchain.  In a new interview, Steve Wager, head of global operations for itBit, spoke at length about the project, rumors of which first began surfacing in late July. Speculation was followed by confirmation from the exchange it would host a private, one-day summit in New York to promote its release.  Called the Bankchain Discovery Summit, Wager said the event drew 100 participants from 25 leading financial institutions, including custodians, broker-dealers and those providing infrastructure support for the industry.  Wager said that itBit built Bankchain using insight from its team's history in the finance industry and input from Wall Street firms, who favor the idea of using a distributed ledger to tokenize existing assets.  Wager told CoinDesk:  ""It is a proprietary itBit protocol, not blockchain based, but is derived off of blockchain. We will also not be using bitcoin as the native token it will be an itBit proprietary token.""  As for market fit, Wager said Bankchain will seek to appeal to institutions seeking to leverage the blockchain for clearing, settlement and custody, though he was also scant in providing details as to any partnerships itBit has secured.  ""We've actually been focused on the custodian and broker-dealer community,"" he continued. ""We've had over 200 unique meetings in New York and California, where they have expressed interest in clearing and custody.""  One of the older bitcoin exchanges in the ecosystem, itBit was also one of the first to raise a significant amount of venture capital, garnering $3.25m in late 2013 from investors including Canaan Partners, Liberty City Ventures and RRE Ventures then as a Singapore-based firm.  ItBit most recently finalized a $25m Series A in May, at which time it relocated its headquarters to New York.  Inspired by the blockchain  Today, Bankchain remains in its infancy, with the platform being operated and used solely by itBit. Wager noted that Bankchain is being used for itBit's cash markets and that nodes on the Bankchain network are currently ""view-only"", meaning it is not yet accepting outside participants, as in the Ripple network.  Wager sought to underscore that Bankchain is ""inspired by"" bitcoin's blockchain, but that it is a consensus-based alternative system. Upon release, he said itBit has no plans to open source the code or distribute it outside of participants in the network.  Moving forward, Wager said Bankchain's underlying technology is currently being subject to peer academic review. Further, he asserted that itBit has received a ""soft commitment"" from as many as 15 firms that are considering implementing the technology.  Still, he cautioned that itBit's potential clients are still learning about the technology, emphasizing the need for a potentially lengthy education phase. In addition, he said, itBit is still determining how it would go about integrating with enterprise clients.  Wager expects any expansion of the project to be delayed until the end of 2015 or early 2016.  ""Eventually down the road, we're also looking at running our exchange through it, so we'll be able to use the consensus mechanism and then we'll be able to issue tokens,"" he explained.  Shifting strategies  While typically thought of as a bitcoin exchange, Wager said that itBit sees itself as capable of being competitive across multiple verticals.  ""We have our cash bitcoin exchange, we've rolled out an over-the-counter (OTC) marketplace and within our global community we will be offering a lending product for bitcoin,"" Wager said.  As itBit has the ability to act as a custodian for both fiat and bitcoin-denominated funds, Wager said he foresees this being broadly useful, allowing it to serve as a repository for assets held in retirement or other investment accounts.  Bankchain, however, aims to underlie all of itBit's services.  ""People who interact with Bankchain will have a modular selection of capabilities that they'll be able to chose from whether its trading, clearing and settlement or custody,"" he continued. ""We believe that the tying in of different business models will increase our competitiveness in the bitcoin space.""  Wager further characterized Bankchain as being capable of satisfying the growing demand for settlement solutions on Wall Street, adding:  ""Itbit is the only one who can allow true settlement finality on a tokenized basis for both assets as well as cash.""  Trust advantage  When asked how itBit will handle market competition in New York given its newcomer status to the state, Wager was quick to note that the exchange is the only entity currently operating with a New York banking charter, though rival Gemini has applied.  As such, he argues that itBit will be able to use this licensure to improve its Bankchain service, which in addition to tokenizing assets, will also allow these digital assets to be converted into US dollars.  ""Moving assets across the chain is relatively straightforward,"" Wager continued, ""But being able to settle to US dollars on the back of that is a different situation.""  Wager said that the banking charter allows itBit to ""tie into"" the existing financial structure in the US, and potentially other national financial services, should it seek to expand abroad. He added:  ""We can become a member of the national settlement service, and that's important because of the fact that most of the firms in blockchain tech have not been able to solve the problem in regards to delivery of a tokenized transaction.""  Wager was also quick to note that itBit is likely to benefit from the ongoing issues stemming from New York's enforcement of the BitLicense, its regulatory scheme for the industry.  ""We can continue to service clients in New York state as well as the US,"" he said, noting that other exchanges, including market leaders such as Bitfinex and Kraken, have chosen to avoid the market rather than bear the cost of licensing.  Still, while beneficial for itBit's prospects, Wager was sympathetic to the hurdle the regulation is likely to put in front of those seeking to compete in the ecosystem.  He concluded:  ""We of course feel for the other exchanges out there, but we do think regulation is a natural evolution for bitcoin as a business that can bring legitimacy to the system.""

42398583,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbcH4t,1439499952,Interpol Held a Dark Market War Game Using its Own Cryptocurrency,"International police organisation Interpol held an interactive training seminar in Singapore last month that utilized an internally developed cryptocurrency and a mock dark market.    The organization's Global Complex for Innovation (GCI) developed the cryptocurrency to use for modelling use cases related to cybercrime. At the time, GCI suggested that it would come to be used in subsequent trainings, the first of which saw 24 participants from law enforcement agencies from around the world.  Countries represented included Australia, France, Ghana, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Singapore, Sri Lanka and Turkey.  CoinDesk spoke with GCI researcher Christian Karam, who said that the exercise – conducted between 27th and 31st July – was the first of several planned events.  A training to be held in Brussels is scheduled for November, with future trainings planned to be conducted in the US and elsewhere.  Karam said that participants played a variety of roles during the game. These included law enforcement officials, dark market operators, vendors, buyers and scammers.  Specific exercises, according to the agency’s release on the training, included mock penetrations of dark web markets to practice searching for vulnerabilities.  The goal, said Karam, was to promote a general understanding of how these ecosystems work:  “We took great care in explaining the concepts in such a manner that police officers do not feel alienated by darknet, bitcoin or cryptocurrencies in general and look more towards accepting these innovations as part of the Internet and try to incorporate them in their daily strategies and tactics.”  Karam said the session produced several notable insights that will impact future trainings. He pointed out that it was initially thought that dark web usage was primarily focused on North America and Europe – a perception he said was changed after conferring with officials from other parts of the world.  “From what we learned most importantly from the group that was trained is that everyone has truly suffered in some way or another and all the countries have pending cases to be solved,” he said.

42398581,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbcH5s,1439494817,The Real Cost of Applying for a New York BitLicense,"In the aftermath of the BitLicense application deadline this week, a number of prominent bitcoin companies have ceased operations in New York.  Although the reasons behind startups' reluctance to apply for a license are varied, cost has played a significant part.  Of those who did apply – and fronted the $5,000 non-refundable application fee, most have alluded to an arduous process and high costs.  But just how much did their expenditure amount to?  CoinDesk has spoken to various companies in the space to breakdown the cost of the BitLicense application process both in monetary and non-monetary terms.  'Expensive and difficult'  ""Applying for the BitLicense is an expensive and difficult process, as many have noted. Some other firms have chosen to abandon the New York market entirely, rather than comply. We do not fault them for doing so,"" said George Frost, executive VP and chief legal officer at Bitstamp.  Frost estimated the application cost Bitstamp roughly $100,000, including time allocation, legal and compliance fees.  ""Our UK parent company has contributed a lot of time, expertise and money in the BitLicense effort, but much of this investment will benefit the entire Bitstamp group,"" said Frost.  Bitstamp, the world's third largest exchange in terms of BTC/USD trading volume, proceeded with the application for various reasons. Firstly, because, if approved, it would allow the company to offer a fully compliant trading platform for New York residents. Secondly, Frost said he expects to be able to offer a broader range of financial tools to customers – including Automatic Clearing House (ACH) deposits, domestic wire transfers and debit card transactions.  The application efforts, he added, included establishing a new operating subsidiary in the US, developing a business plan, establishing appropriate financial controls, hiring a US compliance officer – Lisa Dawson, former senior VP and compliance officer at Citi Group – and spending months ""analysing and agonising over"" the BitLicence's requirements and providing industry comments to the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).  He added:  ""We drafted a detailed risk assessment of Bitstamp USA and the Bitstamp group overall, and more than 30 policies, training manuals and internal procedures guides that we believe are compliant with the New York regulatory regime ... These included hundreds and hundreds of pages of plans covering every aspect of our intended operations. All of this internal scrutiny and drafting has made us a lot smarter company, albeit one with corporate tunnel syndrome.""  Although a costly and cumbersome process, Frost said he believed greater regulation for the ecosystem is inevitable.  ""Like others, we regret the loss of economic freedom occasioned by the onset of regulation. [But] by participating, we are better positioned to help create an industry – and regulatory environment – that achieves widespread adoption and preserves as much individual autonomy as possible.""  Manning the effort  Unlike Bitstamp, which claims to employ up 50 people, bitcoin exchange MonetaGo is sizeably smaller.  Also unlike, Bitstamp, the New York-based company is a relative newcomer to the bitcoin scene, but by no means less eager to comply with the New York State's regulatory framework.  ""Given that we are a new startup company we have been extremely diligent with our expenditures. In terms of hard costs we've spent approximately $50,000 ... by far the biggest costs have been the man-hours to date,"" said Patrick Manasse, chief compliance officer.    Manasse estimates that the team spent approximately 1,200 hours compiling the documentation for the BitLicense application, but noted that an additional 2,000 man hours had already been invested in developing MonetaGo’s global compliance program.    Efforts were spent on providing compliance training to all of the officers and directors, working with lawyers and consultants in various regions and communicating with banks and other relevant authorities.  ""Add to this programmers and developers putting in place systems and service providers, and you start to get a sense of the size and scope of the undertaking,"" he said, noting: ""If all the hours were added up, the total would easily be upwards of a quarter million US dollars.""  So, while putting the actual application together took MonetaGo's team members the better part of the past 45 days – the grace period following the publication of the BitLicense in New York's Register – the process, Manasse said, really began at the company's inception.  Manasse said the ongoing costs, should MonetaGo's submission be approved, are hard to estimate accurately. He believes they will depend on the approach taken by the NYDFS:  ""The Department could easily make it completely unfeasible for startups to continue operating in the space, but that is not the sense that we have gotten from our interactions with them thus far. It is our hope that a measured approach will be taken.""  However, Manasse suggested that being a relatively new company could potentially work to MonetaGo's an advantage in terms of cost.  ""A compliant company such as ours which is newly launched and has a limited operating history probably doesn't require the same amount of scrutiny as other players which have been around since the early days of bitcoin.""  Significant undertaking  A spokesperson for Coinbase confirmed that the San Francisco-based company had submitted its BitLicense application.  Although they declined to divulge specific details, the spokesperson noted the process was a ""significant undertaking"", but one the company had no problem carrying out because it had sufficient internal resources.  Meanwhile, Jaron Lukasiewicz, CEO and founder of Coinsetter, noted his company had spent approximately $50,000 on BitLicense-related expenses over the past two years. ""I think its bigger cost, though, has been in the uncertainty it created for investors looking to invest in our space – hopefully that will begin to reverse itself now.""  Bittrex, a cryptocurrency exchange, also applied for the license. Bittrex founder Bill Shihara told CoinDesk he estimated the process to have cost his company between $18,000 and $20,000, whilst employees spent approximately 80 hours compiling and reviewing the paperwork.  ""I am sure larger companies incurred much higher costs than we did ... we were lucky that we had a lot of the paperwork already available.""  Although he noted the BitLicense was a significant undertaking for companies, he said customers should welcome it:  ""Ultimately, I think customers should be happy about the BitLicense. While it is burdensome for us, the core of the paperwork involved consumer protection. The BitLicense requires background checks on the principals who handle your funds; detailed information of how the funds are stored and credited to our users; proof that the company is profitable; as well as security and incident response plans.""  ""If the BitLicense reviewers do their jobs right, passing the application process means the company holding your funds is a legitimate business that you should want to work with,"" he concluded.  Legal perspective  Marco Santori, counsel at Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, described the application process as ""consultative and iterative"".  ""The NYDFS will not simply take your $5,000 and deny you without ceremony. They will certainly accept the application fee, but if the staff takes issues with some of the applicant's responses, or find deficiencies, they will address them with the applicant. Their objective is to bring businesses into the BitLicense regime, not to block them out of it,"" he added.  The NYDFS, Santori said, has 90 days to grant or deny a BitLicense application, but the Superintendent may extend that period for a reasonable amount of time sufficient to enable compliance with the BitLicense regime. ""It is not clear whether that means compliance by NYDFS or the applicant. I expect that – certainly during the early stages – applications will take longer than 90 days to be approved.""  If an application does not satisfy all the criteria, the authorities may decide to grant a conditional license, which will entail periodic review. ""This is an amorphous thing. The are no criteria set forth in the regulation for what kind of company might qualify for a conditional license or what conditions might be attached for that license.""  ""Unilateral discretion in that regard,"" Santori added, ""is left to the Superintendent. Those seeking a conditional license should submit their application along with a cover letter explaining why they believe one should be granted, and what conditions they believe should attach. It will likely take a bit of advocacy.""

42398578,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbcGzy,1439488212,NYDFS Receives 22 Initial BitLicense Applications,"The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has revealed that it has so far received 22 applications from firms seeking to engage in virtual currency business activity in the US state.  The announcement, made exclusively to CoinDesk, follows the 8th August filing deadline for businesses previously offering such services to the New York market, and does not include firms that have applied for banking charters.  Speaking to CoinDesk, NYDFS deputy superintendent for public affairs Matt Anderson indicated that the agency believes this filing total shows there is ""substantial interest"" in complying with the BitLicense, which was passed earlier this year after months of public debate.  Anderson also addressed criticism of the law from the bitcoin and blockchain community, as well as the media, stating that the agency believes the BitLicense will ultimately lead to broader adoption of the technology by businesses and consumers.  Anderson said:  ""In the long term, we think this is going to be helpful and I think there'll ultimately be some sort of shaking the wheat from the chaff. We think that those companies that want to do business with strong consumer protections and strong regulatory requirements will continue to submit applications.""  Businesses that have since stopped services in the New York market, Anderson said, will be able to apply at a later date should they wish to comply with the licensing.  ""For companies that startup in or enter New York, the process remains. We're open to that. The amount of applications shows that this will ultimately be an important part of the bitcoin regulatory structure,"" he continued.  Anderson said the agency remains committed to keeping an open dialogue with companies who are seeking to understand if their business model is captured under the regulation.  Business that have applied can now expect to be notified that submissions were sufficiently completed before their pending approval is published in the New York State Register.

With the announcement, Ed Giorgio joins a board of advisors that includes Josh Rosner, managing director at research firm Graham Fisher & Co; Kang Global Investors managing partner Richard Kang; and Aitken Advisors founder James Aitken.  In addition to Giorgio, itBit also appointed Jim Manzi, former CEO of Lotus Development Corporation, to its board of directors. The software industry veteran joins former FDIC chairman Sheila Bair; former US Senator Bill Bradley and Stonegate Capital's Jim Manzi in a move that expands the board to six members.  In statements, itBit CEO Chad Cascarilla suggested the appointments will add expertise in key areas as the exchange seeks to expand its foothold in New York and the US.  Cascarilla said:  ""Ed’s expertise in cryptography and cybersecurity will help ensure that itBit’s bitcoin exchange and our next generation of blockchain-based products remain the safest and most secure in the industry.”  In May, itBit announced it had closed $25m in new fundraising, an announcement perhaps overshadowed by its acquisition of a New York banking charter that allows it to offer bitcoin exchange services in the state.  The move preceded an announcement by rival Gemini that it would pursue a similar path to the market and comes amid news that many of the current largest bitcoin exchanges don't plan to offer services in the US state, which is the third-largest by population.

42398594,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbcHFi,1439465171,Dutch Supermarket Bomber Demands Bitcoin Ransoms,"Police in the Netherlands are appealing for witnesses to find a person who is planting explosives and requesting a bitcoin ransom.  According to the policehttps://www.politie.nl/gezocht-en-vermist/dossiers/2015/01-jumbo-incidenten/de-zaak.html  , the first attacks took place in May, when the perpetrator placed explosive devices in three different Jumbo supermarkets – a chain of stores belonging to the Van Eerd Group – in Groningen, the largest city in the north of the country.  Subsequent attacks followed in June and July when the offender sent a congratulatory card containing a small amount of explosive substance to another supermarket in Zwolle, a small town in the province of Overijssel, also in the north of the Netherlands.  The explosions have so far only resulted in property damage and the police investigation is ongoing.  Bitcoin ransoms are also increasingly being used by online hackers who hijack users' computers in exchange for payouts in the digital currency.  A senior executive in Australia was allegedly victimised after their employer was pressured by hackers into paying $14,000 in bitcoin earlier this year.  Reports that two of Hong Kong's largest banks had been targeted with distributed denial of service (DD0S) attacks by perpetrators demanding bitcoin ransoms also surfaced in May.

In a blog post released yesterday, the cloud mining firm – which claims to serve over 50,000 customers – said it had no choice but to block anyone with a New York IP address from using its services.  ""While advocates for the BitLicense say they want to protect consumers, what the act really does is stifle innovation.

With the controversial legislation now in play, following its 8th August registration deadline, 10 bitcoin companies have announced their departure from New York, including Kraken, GoCoin and peer-to-peer marketplace LocalBitcoins. Some cite privacy concerns, while others have balked at the upfront costs and paperwork involved.  In its post, Genesis Mining compared the ""unnecessary"" legislation to the so-called 'Red Flag Acts' the UK imposed on early motor vehicles in the 17th century. While this red tape held back innovation in the country, elsewhere more permissive states benefited from a booming industry.

42398586,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbcH9o,1439460356,Startup Sabr.io is Helping to Catch Bitcoin's Criminals,"A new blockchain startup has claimed its software could help track down criminals faster and cheaper than ever.  Sabr.io  , one of 42 companies unveiled at 500 Startups' demo day in San Francisco this Tuesday, aims to shave valuable time off investigations into outfits such as illicit marketplace Silk Road.  The platform, which integrates data from public and proprietary sources, claims to provide law enforcement with intel on digital currencies that's ""otherwise inaccessible"".  It's unclear exactly what this entails, with CEO David Berger telling CoinDesk he was unable to disclose further details about Sabr.io's technology, given the ""sensitive nature"" of the firm's work.  What is clear however, is that the service is identifying and locating illegal activity happening on blockchains – and a number of agencies are already on board. Berger said:    ""Law enforcement has been and continues to be our partner in the development of this technology. They've shared their needs with us and we're building solutions to meet those needs. Our technology enables them to do their very important work.""            Blind spot  Although the wealth of successful prosecutions for bitcoin-related crimes highlight that digital currencies aren't above the law, it's an area that still requires highly specific investigative skills, which may be out of reach for smaller agencies.  Besides Sabr.io, a number of bitcoin firms, including Chainalysis and London-based custodian Elliptic, are creating whitelabel 'blockchain explorers' designed to bridge this knowledge gap.  Not everyone is happy, however. Companies have come under scrutiny from bitcoin's pro-privacy factions for offering law enforcement the tools to monitor and 'unmask' transactions.  Should running tests on an open, peer-to-peer network such as bitcoin require consent? Others in the space say 'no'. They see solutions like these as a crucial step towards legitimacy and interoperability for cryptocurrencies more broadly.  Berger said:    ""While some have suggested regulatory solutions, we were proud to present a technology-based solution that will lessen the need for regulation.""    Sabr.io's website notes that the utility of blockchain can only achieve further growth within the bounds of the law.  ""I am excited about the future of bitcoin and am determined not to let it be hijacked by criminals. I have no qualms about helping to put child pornographers, terrorists and arms dealers behind bars,"" Berger added.  500 Startups  Tuesday's event  , the climax to four months of intensive mentoring as the Silicon Valley accelerator's 13th batch, was a ""terrific experience"", Berger said.    ""We were overwhelmed by interest from the investors in attendance. I think the investors realise, as do we, that illicit use of digital currencies is a big problem for society.""    Investors have backed this up with cash, too. Alongside 500 Startups and the Digital Currency Group (DCG), Barry Silbert's bitcoin seed fund, the company has raised over $1m from Launch Capital, New Fund and Silicon Badia, among others.  Founded in 2010, 500 Startups provides between $10,000 to $250,000 in seed funding to early-stage startups. Since bringing on ex-MySpace VP Sean Percival as a venture partner to specialise in bitcoin, the incubator has moved to mentor the blockchain space.  Previous bitcoin alums include GoGoCoin, Bonafide.io, Coinalytics, Neuroware and Monetsu who each received $100,000 as part of Batch 9.  Sabr.io and the Digital Currency Council were the two blockchain-related startups in its most recent cohort.

42398582,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbcH1w,1439455532,New Cracking Tool Exposes Major Flaw in Bitcoin Brainwallets,"A white-hat hacker has released a new tool designed to illustrate the ease with which illicit actors can steal bitcoins from brainwallets, a type of bitcoin wallet iteration where passwords are not stored digitally – but in the memory of the user.  Originally conceived as a way to keep sensitive wallet data offline and make bitcoin addresses easier to remember, the brainwallet was partly undone due to how it interacts with the bitcoin blockchain. A brainwallet uses a single, long password or phrase, converts it to a private key, a public key and finally an address. Using an offline attack, it's possible to rapidly guess potential passwords to see if they're correct.    New research by Ryan Castellucci, a security researcher at digital fraud firm White Ops, indicates there is as major flaw in this method. He highlights that the final bitcoin address is recorded in the blockchain as a password hash. When used for website authentication, password hashes help determine whether the word or phrase supplied is correct, meaning this data can be used as a reference to bad actors looking for the password.    Released on 7th August at DEF CON 23, one of the world's largest annual hacker conventions, Castellucci's brainwallet cracker, called Brainflayer, is capable of guessing 130,000 passwords a second. Running on more powerful computers, $1 can be used to check 560 million passphrases, according to its creator.  When this firepower is applied to ASCII passwords, ones constructed from US keyboard characters, and XKCD passwords, those comprised of four common words, Castellucci suggested a botnet could check every bitcoin address that has ever received funds in a single day.  In an interview, Castellucci sought to emphasize that, while the tool he released could be used by criminals, he hopes its release will encourage bitcoin users to adopt better security practices.  Castellucci told CoinDesk:  ""You can scream from the rooftops that something is weak and vulnerable, but many people will just stay in denial without a working proof of concept. I think that the concept of letting humans choose their own passwords and passphrases for high security applications is fundamentally flawed.""  In this case, however, Castellucci's presentation didn't fall on deaf ears.  Following the release, BrainWallet.org, a website that used JavaScript to generate private keys for users, went offline. Though others services remain available, the closure was widely praised by members of the bitcoin security community.  Project beginnings  According to Castellucci, the genesis for the project came in mid-2013, when bitcoin users first began reporting issues with brainwallet security.  Around the same time, a vigilante Reddit user known as btcrobinhood began stealing from brainwallets, returning the funds to their rightful owners in an effort to expose the vulnerability of the technology.  Inspired, Castellucci created an original cracker able to issue 10,000 password guesses a second, a far cry from Brainflayer's capabilities. Still, as he recalls, he was able to feed the program simple word lists and achieve powerful results.  When he returned to his computer, he found the prototype Brainflayer had retrieved 250 BTC, then worth $20,000 from cracked brainwallets.  Castellucci said he was put into a difficult ethical situation as a result. He had two options – take some bitcoins as part of an effort to alert the wallet user that their security is vulnerable, or try to contact them through other means. Ultimately, he said he wasn't sure what to do.  ""For a while I just stopped my research,"" he said. ""I hoped the problem would go away. After all, many experts were saying that brainwallets were bad.""  When the problem didn't disappear, he decided to return to the research, arguing that it was his responsibility to disclose the vulnerability so people could take appropriate steps to keep themselves protected.  ""The idea is that if someone like me discovers a bug, they make a good faith effort to get the bug fixed before sharing it with the world. I've done this in the past, and I think it's generally the right approach,"" he said in a recent blog post.  Future of the tech  The issue with brainwallets, however, is also one that affects anything secured by password protection, according to Castellucci.  As such, he suggested that those who are using brainwallets consider WarpWallets, which are currently considered to be improved iterations of the idea. A warpwallet generator available from Keybase, for instance, allows users to never have to save or store their private keys anywhere, provided they pick ""a really good password"".  With WarpWallets, Castellucci said, a ""salt"", or random data used an input for hashing functions, is integrated into the equation. This means that if a user's salt was their email address, a potential thief would need to know both the salt and the password to compromise funds.  Still, Castellucci advises those who use such wallets to use diceware to generate passwords, a process by which passwords are created by a pair of dice and a random number generator.  ""It seems to be really, really hard to keep people from choosing their dog's name and their birthday as a password. Scrypt can't save people who use 'P@ssw0rd',"" he said. ""A lot of people seemed to think that a long passphrase was a secure passphrase, and I think I've proven that's not necessarily true.""  Lost and found  When asked how he plans to continue his work, Castellucci said he's still in the process of considering follow-up actions.  So far, he's considered adding support for other brainwallet-like tools to Brainflayer, including a mode that would scan with raw private keys. Still, he laments the stress that achieving any advance in bitcoin wallet security might bring.  ""I still dread the possibility of finding another large brainwallet,"" he said. ""Outside of cryptocurrency, if you found a bunch of money and weren't sure who it belonged to, you'd turn it into the police and let it be their problem.""  This process doesn't work yet in the bitcoin ecosystem. As Castellucci noted, online forms of cash have no lost and founds, places where funds could be stored with a reliable third party until they could be claimed by their owner.  Still, while he likes the idea, more questions remain:  ""Who would run such a thing? And what the legal implications would be? I am not sure.""  View Castellucci's full DEF CON presentation here.
