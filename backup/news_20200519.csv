42383776,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9yYUZ,1589921419,Market Wrap: Here's Why Ether's Price Has Jumped 65% So Far This Year,"While bitcoin (BTC) is often discussed as the cryptocurrency best suited for turbulent times, the price of ether (ETH), the second-largest digital asset by market capitalization, has been substantially outperforming bitcoin since the start of 2020. But ether has much different technical dynamics to consider than bitcoin.      As of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET), ether was trading at $211, a loss of less than a percent over the past 24 hours. The native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network was close to its 10-day moving averages, a technical indicator signaling sideways trading, with little price movement. Ether dropped as low as $209 earlier in the day on exchanges such as Coinbase, then hit $215 at 11:00 UTC (7 a.m. ET).      Amid the recent hype about the halving, a once-in-four-years event that reduced the supply of bitcoin and the proclamations of investors like Paul Tudor Jones II that bitcoin is a good investment in an extraordinary economic era, ether’s price has outperformed it. For the year to date, ether is up a whopping 65% while bitcoin has risen 35% for the same period.      A much smaller market capitalization for ether likely helps ignite larger price movements versus bitcoin, says Vishal Shah, a cryptocurrency options trader. “ETH's materially smaller market-cap, on a nominal basis, thus benefits on the margin.” Ether currently has a $23 billion market capitalization versus bitcoin’s $144 billion, according to data from CoinGecko.      “Ether has long been tracking bitcoin’s price action, albeit with higher beta. This means that when bitcoin surges in value, ether’s value usually increases as well by an even greater percentage,” said Michael Anderson, co-founder of Framework Ventures.      Anderson’s firm Framework is focused on decentralized finance, or DeFi, investments. DeFi uses the Ethereum network for various cryptocurrency services such as stablecoins, lending and derivatives.      Read More: The Government Won’t ‘Kill DeFi’ but FATF Might Compromise Anonymity      The prospect of decentralized financial applications helps fuel interest in ether as an investment, says Danny Kim, head of revenue for cryptocurrency liquidity provider SFOX. “To the extent that ether is outperforming bitcoin and becoming a more active network, a big factor to consider is the DeFi sector,” he told CoinDesk.      Ether holders can “lock” the cryptocurrency into a DeFi smart contract address to gain yields on various lending and stablecoin applications on the network. Locking ether into DeFi effectively reduces the supply of ether in circulation for trading, a dynamic that reduces liquidity. “DeFi has become incredibly popular, and large portions of ETH are getting locked up as collateral, removing them from the liquid market,” said Framework’s Anderson.      Indeed, at one time, ether users had locked up over 3.2 million ETH in network smart contracts this year, although that number is down from February highs, according to data analytics firm DeFi Pulse. There are nearly 111 million ETH outstanding.      Nonetheless, traders still prefer bitcoin’s liquidity, regardless of ether’s year-to-date performance. While ether has $42 million in daily volume on spot exchange Coinbase, bitcoin’s volume is almost three times higher, averaging $125 million on the San Francisco-based trading platform. Thus, traders have to carefully balance ether’s profit potential with the fact that its order books are thinner than bitcoin, which can lead to slippage and potential losses when price makes huge swings. In addition, the Ethereum network is planning to go through an ambitious technical transition, Eth 2.0, creating a degree of uncertainty.      Read more: ErisX Announces Launch of First US Ether Futures Contracts      Sweden-based over-the-counter trader Henrik Kugelberg, is bearish on ether and believes that while Ethereum is the DeFi leader for now, that could easily change.“I have a feeling Ethereum is a giant on clay feet. They have a very hard time agreeing on real important stuff and the technology really needs to move along,” he said.      “Ethereum, in my eyes, is at a much greater risk of being bypassed [by another cryptocurrency] than bitcoin.”    Other markets    Digital assets on CoinDesk’s big board are mostly down Tuesday. Bitcoin lost less than a percent in 24 hour trading, priced at $9,663 as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      “We've seen some bitcoin halving effects in the past few days as hashrates have begun falling off sharply and transaction fees rising in tandem, but nothing really having any effect on price thus far,” Singapore-based crypto quantitative fund QCP Capital wrote in an investor note Tuesday morning.      The biggest losers in 24-hour trading are bitcoin gold (BTG) dropping 1.8%, nem (XEM) in the red 1.1% and neo (NEO) slipping 1.1%. The lone cryptocurrency substantially gaining on the board today is cardano (ADA) in the green 2.7%. All price changes were as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET) Tuesday.

42383756,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9yYAR,1589916618,Bitcoin's Halving Is Nothing Like Quantitative Tightening,"Frances Coppola, a CoinDesk columnist, is a freelance writer and speaker on banking, finance and economics. Her book “The Case for People’s Quantitative Easing,” explains how modern money creation and quantitative easing work, and advocates “helicopter money” to help economies out of recession.      On May 11, block 630,000 on the Bitcoin network was mined. The rate at which new bitcoins are produced promptly dropped from 12.5 to 6.25 approximately every 10 minutes. Many people expected this “halving” to trigger a sustained rise in bitcoin’s U.S. dollar price, as it did after previous halvings in 2013 and 2017. And indeed, bitcoin’s price is now trending upwards after an initial sharp fall immediately after the halving. So is there going to be another bitcoin bull run?      The halving has come at a time when the U.S. Federal Reserve is creating unprecedented amounts of new money through “quantitative easing.” For bitcoiners, such profligate fiat money creation only serves to emphasize the soundness of bitcoin, with its built-in scarcity. Echoing the famous message that Satoshi left on Bitcoin’s genesis block, F2Pool, which mined the last block before the halving, etched this on the blockchain: “NYTimes 09/Apr/2020 With $2.3T Injection, Fed's Plan Far Exceeds 2008 Rescue."" The implication is clear: The Fed’s action is bullish for bitcoin.      See also: Bitcoin Halving, Explained      Highlighting the fact that bitcoin’s production rate has fallen just as the Fed’s production rate is wildly increasing, some people have dubbed the halving “quantitative tightening.” But I’m afraid this is wrong. Halving bitcoin’s production rate isn’t quantitative tightening.      Everyone knows that when the Fed does quantitative easing (QE), it is putting new money into the economy. It buys assets from the private sector, which it pays for with newly created dollars. These new dollars circulate in the economy, stimulating activity and raising inflation.      Quantitative tightening is the reverse. The Fed sells assets to the private sector, or allows assets it already holds to mature. It burns the money it receives in return for these assets. So the quantity of dollars in circulation actually falls, depressing activity and reducing inflation. Quantitative tightening is destruction of money.    The halving could both increase the rate at which Bitcoin’s price rises and bring forward the point at which it crashes    As recently as two years ago, the Fed was doing quantitative tightening. It allowed U.S. Treasury bonds on its balance sheet to mature, and burned the money the U.S. government paid it to redeem them. Between 2016 and 2018, the Fed cut base money – the dollars it directly creates - by half. But Bitcoin’s code doesn’t include any mechanism by which the supply of bitcoins can be reduced. Bitcoin can’t burn bitcoins. So it is just wrong to call the halving “quantitative tightening.”      The Fed ended quantitative tightening when international dollar shortages started to cause serious strains in financial markets. It has been putting new money into the system since last September. Now, with the coronavirus pandemic threatening to cause a global depression, the Fed has cut interest rates to zero and embarked on a mammoth QE program. The quantity of base money in circulation will soon be the largest in history. But the dollar exchange rate continues to soar as spooked investors rush into dollar-denominated assets. Despite the Fed’s best efforts, the world remains desperately short of dollars.      However, all that new money rushing round the system could result in high inflation once the economy emerges from its pandemic-induced slump. So bitcoin’s halving has come at just the right moment. Instead of investing in an asset that is being systematically inflated, why not invest in one that is scarce by design and set to become even scarcer?      See also: Third Halving Turns Out to Be Non-Event for Bitcoin’s Price      The problem with this is bitcoin isn’t becoming scarcer. The quantity of bitcoins in circulation is still increasing, just more slowly. The halving is equivalent to the Fed cutting the rate of QE asset purchases by half.      Currently, Bitcoin isn’t “hard money.” Its supply is not fixed, and will not be for a very long time. The famous 21 million limit won’t be reached for over a century, if it is ever reached at all. Diminishing returns may mean miners drop out before the last bitcoin can be mined. Bitcoin’s supply isn’t increasing as fast as the supply of dollars, true, but then it isn’t the world’s preferred savings vehicle at a time of crisis – and bitcoin supporters might want to think about why it still isn’t, after a decade of ultra-low interest rates, three rounds of QE and (now) the biggest money creation program the world has ever seen. Perhaps exorbitant Fed money creation isn’t quite as bullish for bitcoin as its advocates like to think.      So the halving hasn’t made bitcoins scarcer for investors. But there is a group for whom it is now scarcer than it was a couple of weeks ago. Miners.      The purpose of Bitcoin’s periodic halvings is to make bitcoins scarcer for miners. Halving the rate of production of new bitcoins represents a loss of about $58,000 per block mined. So we could call this a pay cut for miners. Or we could say the subsidy that network users pay to miners has been reduced by half. Miners have to work harder for their rewards, which forces out less efficient miners. And as the block reward diminishes, transaction fees make up a larger proportion of miners’ profits. By the time the last block is mined, nearly all of miners’ profits will come from transaction fees.      Sure enough, since the halving marginal miners have started to drop out, and transaction fees have become a larger proportion of the remaining miners’ profits. The halving is doing exactly what it was supposed to do.      See also: ‘History Has Repeated’: F2Pool Explains Message in Last Block Before Bitcoin Halving      The Fed’s behavior was driving up demand for bitcoin before the halving. A slower production rate will widen the gap between supply and demand, increasing the rate at which the price rises. But as anyone with a rudimentary grasp of economics will know, when demand exceeds supply, the price rises until either supply increases to meet demand or demand falls to meet supply.      In the case of bitcoin, supply can’t increase any faster than the code allows, and the code has just slowed it down considerably. Eventually, buyers will drop out and the price will fall. Given the rate at which transaction fees and confirmation times are rising, that could happen sooner rather than later. Paradoxically, therefore, the halving could both increase the rate at which bitcoin’s price rises and bring forward the point at which it crashes.      The Fed’s money creation is already pushing up bitcoin’s price, and bitcoin’s halving could accelerate this rise. There’s still time for a post-halving bull run. But the price rises after the last two halvings both ended in major crashes.

42431948,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN81Lh,1589913344,This  Metric Shows Bitcoin Is Undervalued Even After 150% Price Rally,"Bitcoin has witnessed triple-digit percentage gains over the past two months. Yet, one metric has turned quite bullish after the recent halving event, showing signs the cryptocurrency remains undervalued and still has room to run.      The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is trading near $9,700 at press time, up 150% from its March 12 low of $3,867.      And while that may cause some investors to think the cryptocurrency is overbought or overvalued, an on-chain metric called the “Puell Multiple”, which marked a price bottom in March, is suggesting otherwise.      The Puell Multiple is calculated by dividing the daily issuance value of bitcoins in U.S. dollar terms by the 365-day moving average of the daily issuance value. It is currently just below 0.5, according to the data provided by the blockchain intelligence firm Glassnode.      A reading below 0.5 indicates the value of the newly issued coins on a daily basis is quite low compared to historical standards. Historical data shows bear markets tend to end with the Puell Multiple’s drop below 0.50.      Read more: Bitcoin’s Impending Golden Cross May Bolster Bulls: Analysts      The Puell Multiple is usually influenced by gyrations in price. For instance, if prices drop the dollar value of the daily issuance declines, pushing the ratio lower.      Daily issuance refers to the number of coins added to the ecosystem by miners, who receive them as rewards for mining blocks on the cryptocurrency’s blockchain. Miners mainly operate on cash and cover the cost of mining by offloading their holdings by selling into the market.      However, reduced supply from miners can also weigh on the Puell Multiple. That seems to be the reason behind the ratio’s recent downward move.    Low reading from bitcoin halving    The latest below-0.5 reading on the Puell Multiple is the result of a programmed reduction in the daily issuance.      Bitcoin underwent its third reward halving on May 11, following which rewards per block mined fell to 6.25 BTC from 12.5 BTC. The non-price metric dropped from 1.13 to 0.41 immediately following halving and looks to have bottomed out at 0.37 on May 17.      To put it another way, daily miner supply has declined significantly since May 11 due to halving and the resulting miner capitulation - the small and inefficient miners are scaling back operations due to reduced profitability.      Read more: First Mover: Bitcoin Difficulty Adjustment Feels Like Post-Halving Easing Party      The seven-day average of the hashrate, or the mining power recruited to mine blocks on the blockchain, has declined from 120 exa-hashes per second to below 100 exa-hashes, according to data source CoinMetrics.      Lows in Puell Multiple seen following the previous halvings, which took place in July 2016 and November 2018, had marked the beginning of fresh bull runs in bitcoin’s price.      Bitcoin underwent its second halving on July 9, 2016, pushing the Puell Multiple lower from 1.59 to 0.72 in the four days to July 13. The metric eventually bottomed at 0.59 in mid-August. The price low of $450 seen in the first week of August has never been put to test till date.      Similarly, the Puell Multiple fell from 1.57 to 0.70 in the two days following the first reward halving of Nov. 28, 2012. The gauge bottomed out at 0.62 three weeks later.

According to Iranian news outlet ArzDigital, the parliament published a proposal this week to include cryptocurrency in existing “currency smuggling” and foreign currency exchange regulations. The result of this prospective regulation is Iranian entrepreneurs face a heightened risk of being jailed by local authorities or sanctioned by Americans.      The law would mean Iranian crypto exchanges must be licensed by the Central Bank of Iran and follow legacy foreign currency exchange guidelines, although it’s not apparent how existing exchanges should apply for licensing or adapt those fiat norms to blockchain technology. What is clear is the Iranian government is looking to quell capital outflow by preemptively justifying any moves to shut down or penalize local crypto exchanges.      However, the Iranian market doesn’t strictly consist of homegrown, over-the-counter traders. Unlike fiat currency exchanges, several crypto operations serving Iran are legally based in other countries. It is unclear how the new licensing guidance applies to decentralized ecosystems.      For example, the Binance-owned analytics site CoinMarketCap, officially based in the U.S. state of Delaware, listed the KingMoney token in Q1 2020. CoinMarketCap CSO Carylyne Chan said that “there were no glaring red flags that arose during the application process.” Yet, this bitcoin clone token is clearly promoted in suspicious ways. Social Forensics founder Geoff Golberg said the date of new follows indicates “inauthentic accounts were created solely to make their Twitter community appear more robust leading up to being listed by CMC.”      Read more: Iran Concerns May Be Driving Trump Administration’s Talk of New Crypto Rules      The crypto exchange UtByte and the KingMoney token project both appear to be registered in Sweden under an umbrella firm called Sweden Invest Group AB, led by Swedish-Iranian businessman Reza Khelili Dylami. (Dylami could not be reached for comment by press time.) Some Farsi blogs labeled both these projects as an interconnected “scam.” Regardless, it was obviously marketed to Iranians for the purpose of cross-border transactions.      According to Chainalysis, ""UtByte has received about $13.8 million of BTC and has strong transactional connections to Iranian cryptocurrency services and exchanges.""      The Trump administration’s concerns about Iranians using cryptocurrency to circumnavigate sanctions appear to be correct. It’s unclear how crypto exchanges would continue to bypass sanctions if, in the future, they are tallied and registered with the Central Bank of Iran.      On the other hand, even cryptocurrency projects that are fully based in Iran often benefit from foreign social media efforts. For example, over the past weekend Tron founder Justin Sun promoted Iranian crypto exchange operators like Cryptoland on Twitter.      Cryptoland co-founder Hassan Golmohammadi said the company is legally based outside of Iran but operates locally. When asked about Cryptoland in January 2020, a press representative for the Tron team said it does not directly work with the Iranian company, that any Farsi-language marketing of crypto projects is done “by the China/Asia team at Tron, not Tron US,” and there is “no actual marketing done” in Iran.      According to Babak Jalilvand, editor of the leading Farsi crypto blog CoinIran, there is a “significant” TRX community in Iran precisely because “the Tron team” uses “their marketing skills to attract people.”      Yet, it remains unclear how sanctions would apply to global crypto communities.      Although he’s not familiar with the Tron Foundation specifically, Dan Newcomb, a compliance expert at law firm Shearman & Sterling, said in January that U.S. economic sanctions applicable to Iran apply to any individual or organization doing business in the U.S.      “Marketing in Iran is soliciting business in Iran,” Newcomb said.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/05/19/iran-moves-to-restrict-crypto-exchanges-under-currency-smuggling-laws,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7d6dccc9e43a84f69b395618e1c7731bf9e2a275-1500x875.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The stolen data belonged to people from different countries, including the European Union and the U.S., the agency claimed.      The agency seized ""computer equipment with two terabytes of stolen information, phones with evidence of illegal activities and cash from illegal transactions,"" including about $10,000 in Ukrainian hryvnias and U.S. dollars, the release said.      See also: BlockFi Says Hacker SIM-Swapped Employee’s Phone, No Funds Were Lost      The seizures happened after SSU received a tip that Sanix is “probably a Ukrainian, a resident of [the] Ivano-Frankivsk region"" and searched his home.      Sanix now faces criminal charges for unauthorized interference with computers and unauthorized sale or dissemination of information with limited access. According to the Ukrainian criminal code, a combination of these two can lead up to eight years of prison time.      The breach was first reported in January 2019 by cybersecurity researcher Troy Hunt. Wired called it “a breach of breaches,” saying the 87-gigabyte database “claims to aggregate over 2,000 leaked databases that contain passwords whose protective hashing has been cracked.”      The first batch of stolen data had been followed by several more “collections,” offered by Sanix as well as another hacker named Oxa, Forbes wrote at the time.

42431939,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN81Jh,1589905889,PTJ on BTC: Bitcoin Is Now the Macro Big Bet,"Byrne Hobart, a CoinDesk columnist, is an investor, consultant and writer in New York. His newsletter, The Diff (diff.substack.com), covers inflection points in finance and technology.      The bull case for bitcoin as a store of value is simple: at first nobody owns it. Then it’s owned by people who are some combination of crazy and smart, but generally crazier than they are smart. Over time the craziness requirement drops, more investors buy it and it becomes dumb not to own a little. Since existing monetary systems are necessarily optimized for the status quo – and the dollar is, in fact, very well optimized for a globalized world with a hegemonic United States – an alternative system like bitcoin is necessarily a bet on a weirder world.      We certainly live in a weird world today.      And some sophisticated money managers are taking notice.      See also: Hedge Fund Pioneer Turns Bullish on Bitcoin Amid ‘Unprecedented’ Monetary Inflation      Paul Tudor Jones II, a well-regarded global macro investor, made headlines last week when he announced he’d bought bitcoin and planned to invest up to a single-digit percentage of his net worth in the currency. PTJ is not exactly a nose-ringed millennial day trading on Robinhood. He’s been running his fund since 1980 and has accumulated almost $40 billion in assets under management.      Jones is best known as a global macro investor, placing bets on interest rates, currencies and commodities. He founded his firm at the beginning of a golden age of macro investing, as the world worked through the implications of the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, volatility in oil and the rise of Japan. In one five-year period, Jones’ worst annual return was 99.2%. But since the heady days of the 1970s and 1980s, macro has gotten more challenging, and the pace has slowed. Aggressive traders used to be a powerful force (in the mid-1990s, U.S. President Bill Clinton was shocked by how powerful funds were, exclaiming to an adviser: “You mean to tell me that the success of the economic program and my re-election hinges on the Federal Reserve and a bunch of f---ing bond traders?”)      Since then, several things have changed. Central banks have gotten more powerful because declining inflation gave them more flexibility to raise and lower rates to stimulate growth, and their perceived success in averting crises gave them a broader mandate. Meanwhile, the macro market has gotten more competitive: There are more pure macro funds, and the banks and businesses that took the other side of their trades have gotten more sophisticated. Today, macro funds try to eke out modest gains instead of betting on the rise and fall of nations.    The endgame for Bitcoin as a reserve asset is that it has a place on central banks’ balance sheets, like gold and the Swiss Franc.    But their trading style remains intact. Paul Tudor Jones’ approach is well documented in interviews, including the classic documentary Trader. Jones’ approach boils down to two things: understanding fundamentals and believing prices. A purist might focus entirely on building the fundamental argument for why a given asset is a good purchase – looking at a company’s earnings growth and competitive position, or judging a currency based on its government’s fiscal and monetary policy. A pure speculator typically makes decisions entirely based on price action, ignoring the underlying reason. Jones’ approach synthesizes these: He assumes prices move for a reason, and that if you understand the reason you can accurately predict the rest of the move.      In bitcoin’s case, Jones starts with the premise that the money supply has massively increased but the supply of goods and services has declined. As he put it in his investment memo: “A large demand shortfall will prevent goods and services inflation from rising in the short term. The question is whether that will be the case in the long term with a central bank whose central focus will be repairing the worst employment crisis since the Great Depression.” (Emphasis added.)      If demand can’t meet supply – there’s money in your pocket but you can’t take a vacation or go out to a fancy dinner – the money still has to go somewhere. In most recessions, that money finds its way into savings accounts (in 2007, the average savings rate as a percentage of disposable income was 3.7%. By 2012, it had more than doubled to 8.8%). But savers are rational, and when rates are low they’ll look for somewhere else to put their money. Jones considers several vehicles for savings: stocks and bonds, cash, gold, and bitcoin. He ranks them according to criteria such as trustworthiness, liquidity, purchasing power and portability. He concludes that, based on those criteria, bitcoin is fundamentally the least desirable of all the savings vehicles, just based on its intrinsic traits.      But that’s a value judgment; the other question is price. And on price, bitcoin is the winner; its value is under 2% of gold’s and less than 0.1% of the value of all financial assets.      So after careful due diligence, the famous trend-chasing macro investor ultimately treated bitcoin as a value play.      That’s not as crazy as it sounds. Currencies are always odd assets because their value is a self-fulfilling prophecy: A dollar is worth a dollar because people treat it as being worth a dollar, and people treat it as being worth a dollar because other people do. This makes every currency by its nature a slow-motion momentum trade (with a vicious unwind when the country loses control of its currency). On most of the traits that matter for currencies – stability and liquidity – bitcoin scores poorly. But the higher its value, the better it looks.      Since a working currency is a slow-motion speculation and a new cryptocurrency is a hyperactive speculative asset, it makes sense to think of the progress a currency makes as a process of rising in value and slowing down in volatility. And one way that happens – the way it has to happen – is that larger speculators with slightly longer time horizons accumulate positions. The endgame for bitcoin as a reserve asset is that it has a place on central banks’ balance sheets, like gold and the Swiss franc: In case of emergency, break open the cold wallet. And the intermediaries in that process are institutional investors.      Part of the way macro funds work is by keeping close tabs on the economy, and that means talking to academics and policymakers. Depending on your outlook this is either reasonable behavior – politicians consulting with relevant subject matter experts on complex topics – or it’s a conspiracy in which speculators make trades and then lean on the government to make those trades profitable. It’s probably a bit of both: Traders do have good information and can spend all of their time mentally stress testing an investment thesis. But they also have a strong incentive to talk their book.      See also: The Great Monetary Inflation: Paul Tudor Jones’ Complete Case for Bitcoin      A macro fund with a bitcoin position is one step closer to a central bank with the same kind of position. And while Jones’ $40 billion under management certainly sounds like a lot of money, it’s a tiny amount compared to central bank balance sheets.      It’s important not to get too fixated on any one trader, of course. Jones says he actually owned bitcoin personally back in 2017 when he played the bubble and sold out near the top. “It is amazing how well one can trade when there is no leverage, no performance pressure and no greed to intrude upon rational reflection! When it doesn’t count, we are all geniuses,” he says. (That’s right: 2020 is so weird you just learned a billionaire hedge fund manager is jealous of your trading opportunities.) Given short-term performance requirements and high leverage, a hedge fund is a naturally weak hand in the market.      But it’s a good sign that more funds are looking at, and acting on, the bitcoin opportunity. As Jones puts it in his letter to investors: “Something appears wrong here and my guess is it is the price of bitcoin.” He closes more ominously: “One thing is for sure, these are going to be incredibly interesting times.” Indeed.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Byrne Hobart,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/19/ptj-on-btc-bitcoin-is-now-the-macro-big-bet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b119b7ec165184c6676f59661e34e56a15282d70-2186x1408.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

While customer funds are secure, BlockFi said, their names and addresses were compromised along with their activity histories.      This security breach comes on the heels of a cryptojacking exploit targeting European supercomputers researching COVID-19. Elsewhere, class-action lawsuits have been brought against Block.one and chip-maker Nvidia, while the little-known firm BMA is suing BitMEX for allegedly orchestrating the largest financial crime in American history. Here's the story:      You're reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they're significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk's newsletters here.    Top Shelf    BlockFi Hack BlockFi said an attacker got hold of users' data by compromising an employee's phone and taking control of the person's phone number through a SIM-swap attack. The New York-based crypto lending platform announced in a memo to users on Tuesday that a hacker – whose identity remains unknown – gained access to some of its retail marketing systems for just over an hour early on May 14. The hacker accessed confidential data such as names, dates of birth, postal addresses and activity histories but was unable to withdraw user funds or access other sensitive account information including bank account details, Social Security and tax identification numbers.      BitMEX Down The trading engine for BitMEX, formerly the largest bitcoin derivatives exchange measured by open interest, went down on Tuesday, according to the exchange’s status page. BitMEX supported roughly $2.2 billion in bitcoin futures trading volume over the last 24 hours, according to Skew, and is investigating the incident.      RICO Violations? BMA LLC, the Puerto Rican company that two weeks ago filed a lawsuit again Ripple, has accused the BitMEX derivatives exchange of orchestrating the largest financial crime in American history. The filing envisions a vast racketeering conspiracy designed to reap billions in illegal profit through wire fraud, money laundering, unlicensed money transmission, interstate transport of stolen property and violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO.      EOS Class-Action A cryptocurrency investment fund has launched a class-action lawsuit against Block.one and EOS' high command, arguing the ""fraudulent scheme"" failed to deliver on its primary promise of decentralization. In a recent filing, plaintiffs argue CEO Brendan Blumer, CTO Dan Larimer, former Chief Strategy Officer Brock Pierce and former partner Ian Grigg purposefully misled investors and artificially inflated the EOS token price during the yearlong ICO, which raised a total of $4.1 billion between June 2017 and June 2018. Last year, Block.one reached a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over running an unregistered security sale.      Misleading Games A recent filing shows that disgruntled investors are still pursuing action against Nvidia, the multinational chip-making giant, accused of under-reporting its sales of hardware used to mine cryptocurrency. The shareholder class-action lawsuit accuses CEO Jensen Huang, CFO Collette Kress and Jeff Fisher, senior vice president and head of gaming, of misleading investors by saying increased sales of its chips came from gamers rather than the unsustainable 2017 crypto mining boom.      Smashing Private Keys Tornado Cash, a privacy tool for obfuscating the history of ether transactions, is now fully permissionless. Developers used a cryptographic method known as multi-party computation (MPC), to eliminate their private keys and make the protocol completely trustless.      Monopoly Busting Blockchain Vitalik Buterin has called for lawmakers to be more accommodating to blockchain protocols, saying they can help antitrust agencies fight monopolies and anti-competitive behavior. Together with a Harvard economist, the creator of Ethereum argued in a newly-published paper that blockchain and antitrust agencies ""share a common goal"" in decentralizing economies.      Giancarlo Joins Former U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo is advising a coronavirus relief effort. The Open Initiative is prepared to grant more than $200,000 to tech-driven – and preferably blockchain – solutions to the current crisis.      Libra Hire Libra has added a former U.S. government official as its general counsel, its second add from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). Announced by the Libra Association Tuesday, Robert Werner joins the project with ""a wealth of regulatory, financial crime compliance and enforcement experience"" from his previous roles as FinCEN director and director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).      Cryptojacking European supercomputers programmed to search for a coronavirus vaccine were hijacked last week to mine the privacy crypto monero. The hackers had gained entry via stolen remote access credentials from individuals authorized to operate the machines, and many of the affected computers are still down pending investigation.      Black Market Mixing Bitfury’s crypto analytics unit Crystal Blockchain issued a report showing bitcoin mixing services are on the rise. According to the report, the share of bitcoin sent to mixers by darknet entities rose to 20% in Q1 2020 as compared to just 1% in Q1 2019, The Block reports.      Eying Blockchain Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), a giant of financial markets infrastructure, is studying whether distributed ledger technology (DLT) could accelerate its processing of securities. DTCC revealed two projects Monday aimed at integrating DLT with capital markets: Ion, a proof-of-concept alternative settlement service and Whitney, a security token method of private securities issuance and exchange. The corporation handles nearly $2 quadrillion in securities every year, almost the entirety of the U.S. securities market.      tBTC Bug After pausing the tBTC protocol, which brought Bitcoin onto Ethereum, developer Matt Luongo clarified his decision without going into detail as to what went wrong. The Thesis team said it discovered a bug, but will not disclose details until all funds have been safely withdrawn from this iteration of tBTC. The team is helping users withdraw deposited BTC.      Proof of Societal Value “Much ink has been spilled on the question of bitcoin’s energy footprint. But amid the clarifying details and the energy mix calculations we have lost sight of the most important questions,” CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter writes in his latest op-ed. Central to the debate are the inefficiencies baked into the global energy sector, including line-loses and the overbuilding of energy infrastructure in Chinese provinces, as well as bitcoin’s considerable consumption and CO2 externalities. Ultimately, it’s about tradeoffs. The Bitcoin network is an open system, “which is paid for,” both in fees and energy consumption.    Market Intel    Difficult Adjustments? Days after the biggest non-event of the year, the Bitcoin halving, holders are counting down to the next milestone on the blockchain: the latest ""difficulty adjustment,"" expected Tuesday around 5 p.m. ET. This automatic mechanism occurs roughly every two weeks, and is expected to make mining easier. “And like the halving, it's expected to be uneventful,” the First Mover team said. However, it's an essential way to regulate the network, enticing miners to stay on, reducing confirmation times and also ensuring more equitable payouts. You can get First Mover in yer mailbox here.      Bitcoin Burst Wrapped Bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain in the form of the WBTC ERC20 token has doubled to nearly $23 million worth in tokens in the last two weeks. This follows a vote at Maker to introduce the token as a form of collateral on the protocol. (Decrypt)      Untethered Yesterday, Tether, the largest stablecoin tied to the U.S dollar, had fallen below par value for the longest stretch since bitcoin hit 12-month lows in March. This deviation is partially explained by increased demand for bitcoin and bitcoin futures, with investors trading in stable assets for the cryptocurrency. Tether’s dip below $1 also coincides with a brief respite of new token issuances.

42431937,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN81Fh,1589904101,Base Layer Blockchain Harmony Adds Staking to Open Up Validator Set,"Harmony announced Tuesday its mainnet has now incorporated staking, allowing users to earn ONE tokens for locking in their current holdings. Harmony is built to be a very fast base layer blockchain for transactions and smart contracts.      ""Staking is the mechanism that will allow us to trust participants in our network without knowing them. Now that staking is complete, we can take a huge step towards decentralization by opening the protocol to the public,"" Nick White, a Harmony co-founder, told CoinDesk in an email. The blockchain is currently run by Harmony and trusted partners, but staking opens it to broader participation.      Currently, roughly five billion ONE tokens exist. The protocol emits 441 million ONE per year, all of which will go to stakers. More details on Harmony's token-economics can be found on its blog.      Harmony announced raising $18 million to build its high-throughput sharded blockchain in April 2019. Like many teams, it raised money with a token that originated on Ethereum, but that transitioned to a standalone blockchain. Harmony's market capitalization currently sits at $15.8 million, according to CoinMarketCap.      Read more: Apple, Amazon Alums Behind Sharding Startup Raise $18 Million      There are 16 staking partners who have committed to work with Harmony on running its validations including Staked, Stake.fish, Blockdaemon, Everstake, InfStones and others.      Harmony believes deploying staking is notable because it is doing so on a sharded blockchain.      ""Staking itself is a frontier technology within the blockchain industry. Projects like Cosmos took years to design and build a secure staking protocol for a non-sharded chain. When sharding is added into the mix with staking, the complexity increases dramatically,"" White wrote. ""Ensuring that such a system runs securely requires enormous theoretical rigor and practical engineering.""      Read more: Harmony Kicks Off Migration From Ethereum and Binance Chains to Its Own      The easiest way to participate would be to join one of Harmony's staking partners; however, the team encourages standalone staking. ""We designed the protocol to require very little computing power and token stake to make staking accessible for more people and to encourage decentralization,"" White wrote.      The minimum requirements to participate are:    A computer with two cores, 2GB of memory and 30GB of storage  10,000 ONE tokens (roughly $30) to run a validator    However, because validators will initially be limited to a slate of 320 (actually 80 validators for each of their four shards), White expects the pragmatic minimum to run a validator will be something like $22,000 worth of ONE.

42431926,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN80th,1589897729,The Last Word on Bitcoin's Energy Consumption,"CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter is partner at Castle Island Ventures, a public blockchain-focused venture fund based in Cambridge, Mass. He is also the cofounder of Coin Metrics, a blockchain analytics startup.      Much ink has been spilled on the question of Bitcoin’s energy footprint. But amid the clarifying details and the energy mix calculations we have lost sight of the most important questions. Anyone who wades into this muddy debate must consider the fundamentals before making a final assessment.    Energy: a local phenomenon    Let’s start with the basics. Many people, when decrying Bitcoin’s energy footprint, point out its energy consumption and presume that someone, somewhere is being deprived of electricity because of this rapacious asset. Not only is this not the case, but Bitcoin’s presence in many jurisdictions doesn’t affect the price of energy at all because the energy there isn’t actually being used. How could this be?      The first thing to understand is that energy is not globally fungible. Electricity decays as it leaves its point of origin; it’s expensive to transport. Globally, about 8 percent of electricity is lost in transit. Even high-voltage transmission lines suffer ""line losses,"" making it impractical to transport electricity over very long distances. This is why we talk about an energy grid — you have to produce it virtually everywhere, especially near to population centers.      When you consider Bitcoin’s energy intake, interesting patterns emerge. New data from the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance has confirmed what we effectively already knew: China is the epicenter of Bitcoin mining, with specific regions like Xinjiang, Sichuan and Inner Mongolia dominating. With the cooperation of mining pools, the Cambridge researchers were able to geolocate the IPs of a sizable fraction of active miners, creating a novel dataset giving us new insight into Bitcoin’s energy mix.      And the results are revealing: Sichuan, second only in the hashpower rankings to Xinjiang, is a province characterized by a massive overbuild of hydroelectric power in the last decade. Sichuan’s installed hydro capacity is double what its power grid can support, leading to lots of “curtailment” (or waste). Dams can only store so much potential energy in the form of water before they must let it out. It’s an open secret that this otherwise-wasted energy has been put to use mining Bitcoin. If your local energy cost is effectively zero but you cannot sell your energy anywhere, the existence of a global buyer for energy is a godsend.      There is historical precedent for this phenomenon. Other commodities have been employed to export energy, effectively smoothing out ripples in the global energy market. Before Bitcoin, aluminium served this purpose. A huge fraction of aluminum’s embodied cost is the cost of electricity involved in smelting bauxite ore. Because Iceland boasts cheap and abundant energy, in particular in the form of hydro and geothermal, smelting bauxite was a natural move. The ore was shipped from Australia or China, smelted in Iceland and shipped back to places like China for construction.      See also: Bitcoin Miners, US Energy Producers and Moore's Law      This led to an Icelandic economist famously stating that Iceland “export[s] energy in the form of aluminum.” Today, Iceland is hoping it can replicate this model with the export of energy via data storage. This is why smelters are located in places where electricity is abundant, and where the local consumers may not be able to absorb all that capacity. Today, many of these smelters have been converted into Bitcoin mines – including an old Alcoa plant in upstate New York. The historical parallels are exquisite in their aptness.    Ultimately it’s just a matter of opinion as to whether the existence of a non-state, synthetic monetary commodity is a good idea.    So to sum up, part of the reason Bitcoin consumes so much electricity is because China lowered the clearing price of energy by overbuilding hydro capacity due to sloppy central planning. In a non-Bitcoin world, this excess energy would either have been used to smelt aluminum or would simply have been wasted.      My favorite way to think about it is as follows. Imagine a topographic map of the world, but with local electricity costs as the variable determining the peaks and troughs. Adding Bitcoin to the mix is like pouring a glass of water over the 3D map – it settles in the troughs, smoothing them out. As Bitcoin is a global buyer of energy at a fixed price, it makes sense for miners with very cheap energy to sell some to the protocol. This is why so many oil miners (whose business results in the production of lots of waste methane) have developed an enthusiasm for mining Bitcoin. From a climate perspective, this is actually a net positive. Bitcoin thrives on the margins, where energy is lost or curtailed.    It’s about the energy mix    Another common mistake energy detractors make is to naively extrapolate Bitcoin’s energy consumption to the equivalent CO2 emissions. What matters is the type of energy source being used to generate electricity, as they are not homogenous from a carbon footprint perspective. The academic efforts that get breathlessly reported in the press tend to assume either an energy mix which is invariant at the global or country level. Both Mora et al and Krause and Tolaymat generated flashy headlines for their calculations of Bitcoin’s footprint, but rely on naive extrapolations of energy consumption to CO2 emissions.      Even though lots of Bitcoin is mined in China, it’s not appropriate to map China’s generic CO2 footprint to Bitcoin mining. As discussed, Bitcoin seeks out otherwise-curtailed energy, like hydropower in Sichuan, which is relatively green. Any reliable estimate must take this into account.    Silver linings    The prospects look even sunnier when you consider the changing nature of Bitcoin security spend. Eighty-seven percent of Bitcoin’s terminal supply has been issued already. Due to the path Bitcoin’s price took during the heavy-issuance phase, miners will have been collectively rewarded just over $17 billion in exchange for finding those coins (assuming simply that they sold their coins when they mined them), even though the coins are worth $160 billion today. This is because most of those coins were issued at cheaper price points.      If Bitcoin ends up being worth substantially more in the future than it is worth today (say, by an order of magnitude), then the world will actually have received a discount on its issuance. The energy-externality of pulling those Bitcoins out of the mathematical ether will actually have been very low, due to the historical contingency of when, price-wise, those Bitcoins were actually mined. In other words: Bitcoin’s energy expenditure may end up looking rather cheap in the final analysis. Coins only need to be issued once. And it’s better for the planet that they be issued when the coin price was low, and the electricity expended to extract them was commensurately low.      See also: Bitcoin Halving 2020: How the World's Largest Mining Pool Is Helping Miners 'De-Risk'      As any Bitcoin observer knows, issuance as a driver of miner revenue will decline with time. Last week’s halving cut the issuance side of miner revenue by half. If I had to make a guess, Bitcoin’s periodic halvings will at least offset its appreciation long term, making runaway growth in security spend unlikely. Fees will necessarily grow to account for a much larger fraction of miner income. Fees have a natural ceiling to them, as transactors must actively pay them on a per-transaction basis. If they become too onerous, users will look elsewhere, or economize on fees with other layers that periodically settle to the base chain.      Thus it’s unlikely that security spend results in the world-eating feedback loop that has been posited in the popular press. In the long term, Bitcoin’s energy consumption is a linear function of its security spend. Like any other utility, the public’s willingness to pay for block-space will determine the resources that are allocated to providing the service in question.    Is it worth it?    Now, despite all the caveats listed above, it’s undeniable that Bitcoin not only consumes a lot of energy but produces externalities in the form of CO2 emissions. This is not under debate. What Bitcoiners are often confronted about is whether Bitcoin has a legitimate claim on any of society’s resources. This question relies on a kind of utilitarian logic about which industries should be entitled to consume energy. In practice, no one actually reasons like this. The Bitcoin-energy supplicants are mum when it comes to the energy used to illuminate Christmas lights, to power the data centers behind Netflix or to distribute untold millions of single-serve meal kits. It’s clear that because Bitcoin’s footprint is so easy to quantify — and an object of revulsion among the chattering classes — it is singled out for special treatment.      Ultimately it’s just a matter of opinion as to whether the existence of a non-state, synthetic monetary commodity is a good idea. The truth is that blockspace is a service which is paid for, and that’s where its resource cost is derived. Something duly purchased cannot, by definition, be a waste. Its buyer derives benefit from its existence, regardless of anyone else’s subjective opinion of the merit of the transaction. These same arguments have been made countless times about perceived “costs” of the gold standard, and rebutted on similar grounds before. Fundamentally, millions of individuals the world over still value physical, bank-independent savings, so it still gets pulled out of the ground with regularity. As long as people value Bitcoin, so, too, will the block-space auction continue in perpetuity.      The Bitcoin-energy worriers need not despair, however. There is a solution. All they must do is persuade Bitcoin fans to use and value an alternative settlement medium. Their best bet will be to devise a system that is even more secure, offers stronger assurances, settles faster, is more privacy preserving and is more censor resistant – all without using Proof-of-Work. Such a system would be miraculous. I’m waiting with bated breath.

42431923,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN80ph,1589897039,Libra Taps Another Former FinCEN Official as General Counsel,"The Switzerland-based entity managing the Facebook-led Libra project has added a former U.S. government official as its general counsel.      Announced by the Libra Association Tuesday, Robert Werner joins the project with ""a wealth of regulatory, financial crime compliance and enforcement experience"" from his previous roles as director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).      Werner has also acted as senior counsel for the Under Secretary of the Treasury, Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, and assistant general counsel for Enforcement and Intelligence in the Office of the General Counsel.      The new addition marks Libra's second hire of a former FinCEN official after Stuart Levey was brought on board as its first chief executive early in May. Levey – who is leaving HBSC for the new role – is expected to join ""later this summer"" to oversee Libra's efforts to ""combine technology innovation with a robust compliance and regulatory framework.""      In mid April, the Geneva-incorporated Libra Association kicked off the process of applying for a payment system license with the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority – a move it said was ""an important milestone as the Libra Association moves to a more operational phase of the project.""      See also: Libra’s Long Road From a Facebook Lab to the Global Stage: A Timeline      The project has had its issues to date, however. After a tidal wave of regulatory kickback for its original concept of a stablecoin linked to a basket of fiat currencies, the plan was watered down somewhat in April, and it will now develop a number of stablecoins each representing a different fiat currency.      Prior to joining Libra, Werner was also the founder and CEO of GRH Consulting and had held senior positions at financial firms including HSBC, Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch.      ""I am grateful for the opportunity to join the Libra Association, as we work to transform the global payments landscape to empower billions of people,” Werner said in the announcement. “I have dedicated my career to combating financial crime and helping complex organizations achieve regulatory compliance, both in government and in the private sector.

Announced Tuesday, the project helmed by former JPMorgan blockchain leads has inked a deal to use Chainlink’s existing set of off- and on-chain oracles for pricing Kadena-based assets, beginning with kadena (KDA), co-founder Stuart Popejoy said in a phone interview.      For Kadena, which markets itself as a high-throughput alternative to both the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains, Chainlink will provide developer tools for decentralized applications (dapps) based on Kadena’s Pact smart contract language.      KDA itself has yet to be listed on any secondary markets, but Popejoy said the token should be listed on two top-ten cryptocurrency exchanges by the end of Q3 2020.      Read more: Kadena Goes Live, Announces New Token Sale Aiming for $20 Million      “Chainlink has figured out how to incentivize an ecosystem of multiple players with their LINK token. They’re already able to enforce certain concepts of governance and data quality, just [by] having a diversity of vendors,” Popejoy said.      For Chainlink, the Kadena integration amounts to another non-Ethereum blockchain subscriber to its price feeds. Tezos and Polkadot announced integrations earlier this spring.      “Chainlink is a blockchain-agnostic oracle network that works equally well with both public and private blockchains, and is therefore capable of providing off-chain connectivity to Kadena’s unique approach to enterprise-grade blockchain infrastructure,” Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov told CoinDesk. “Our decentralized oracle network allows access to high-quality data that is valued by institutions using Kadena’s enterprise-focused hybrid blockchain.”      Read more: Tezos Becomes Latest Blockchain to Tap Chainlink for Oracle Services      Popejoy said the Kadena blockchain is both sharded – meaning data is siloed across databases yet still communicative – and runs in parallel for optimum speed, technical features he believes mainstream markets will demand as the blockchain industry grows.      In fact, Popejoy sees a future where nodes are too complex for the average user to manage, a value not shared by the leading public blockchains.      “We don’t have a resistance to the network getting large enough that you really need professional services to run a node because we think that’s where blockchain is headed,” Popejoy said.      Launched in January, Kadena raised $15 million in a 2018 funding round joined by Multicoin Capital and the venture arm of the owners of Fidelity Investments.

42431934,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN817h,1589892502,"Block.one Failed to Decentralize EOS, Argues New Securities Fraud Lawsuit","A cryptocurrency investment fund has launched a class-action lawsuit in a U.S. court against Block.one and EOS' high command, arguing the ""fraudulent scheme"" failed to deliver on its primary promise of decentralization.      The Crypto Assets Opportunity Fund (CAOF), along with individual investor Johnny Hong, has accused Block.one, CEO Brendan Blumer, CTO Dan Larimer, former Chief Strategy Officer Brock Pierce and former partner Ian Grigg, of trying to ""capitalize on the investor fervor for cryptocurrencies"" in 2017 to host an illegal securities sale.      In a strongly worded filing with the Southern District of New York, plaintiffs argue defendants purposefully misled investors and artificially inflated the eos token price during the yearlong initial coin offering (ICO), which raised a total of $4.1 billion between June 2017 and June 2018.      The filing reads: ""This case arises out of a fraudulent scheme, fueled by a global frenzy over cryptocurrencies and unchecked human greed, to raise billions of dollars through sales of a cryptocurrency called EOS – an unregistered security – to investors in violation of the United States federal securities laws.""      Both COAF and Hong are seeking damages, to be agreed on by the federal court, from the defendants.      See also: On EOS Blockchain, Vote Buying Is Business as Usual      The suit, filed Monday, has six counts. These include well-worn accusations such as Block.one aggressively marketed its token sale in the U.S. without first registering it with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).      But the case's linchpin is the accusation Block.one and its representatives made ""dozens of materially false and misleading statements"" about EOS, especially in attempts to promote it as a superior new type of decentralized protocol.      In the filing, plaintiffs say EOS was always publicly described as decentralized, and that this formed a crucial part of the whitepaper and broader ICO pitch.      But, they claim, this turned out to be false as soon as the protocol launched. It was the 21 block producers (BPs) who really controlled the ecosystem rather than the community itself, the filing reads. Key parts of the governance system such as the arbitrator, who could reverse and freeze transactions at will, were never disclosed at the time of the sale, the plaintiffs claim.      As proof that EOS was not the decentralized protocol investors had been led to believe, the filing cites a statement Pierce made in 2019 – after he had left Block.one – when he claimed EOS was effectively controlled by a ""Chinese oligarchy.""      ""Block.one did not have the ability to create a decentralized EOS blockchain,"" the suit concludes. The plaintiffs say the failure to deliver on one of the sale's key promise – as well as the costly Voice pivot – has had a negative impact on the eos token price, which materially harmed investors like themselves.      See also: Block.one Plans to Start Voting on EOS, the Blockchain It Birthed      CAOF is an Illinois-based pooled fund set up in 2017 under the umbrella of Victoria Capital – a blockchain-specific investment and advisory fund. There is very little public information about individual investor Johnny Hong besides that he resides in Solvang, California.      It isn't clear when CAOF bought into the EOS ICO or for how much, although a Medium post by CEO Brandon Elsasser, who is also Victoria Capital's chief investment officer (CIO), said in a July 2018 update that the fund had forsworn further ICO investing as it presented more risk than was deemed prudent.      Block.one reached a settlement with the SEC last September, agreeing to pay $24 million in damages for running an unregistered securities sale in exchange for a waiver on the legal restrictions that would usually be applied.      At the time, SEC Division of Enforcement co-Director Steven Peikin said in a statement that Block.one had failed to provide investors with the information typically included in a securities sale.      Considering the $24 million penalty represented 0.58% of the initial raise, some criticized the settlement as little more than a slap on the wrist. Earlier this year, investors filed another complaint requesting damages against Block.one after participating in the token sale.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/05/19/blockone-failed-to-decentralize-eos-argues-new-securities-fraud-lawsuit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bef73d06b014882924b2956088801e5111f5618d-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Christopher Giancarlo.      The Lykke-led Open Initiative will give four grants of 50,000 Swiss francs ($51,300) to projects in four areas: a digital vouchers platform for small businesses to receive government funding; a supply chain platform; a real-time economic information system; and a research initiative geared toward crisis management.      “Seeing the pandemic I realized that governments were taking reactive measurements and I soon realized there was a big gap to be filled by doing proactive measures,” said Lykke CEO Richard Olsen.      For example, the voucher platform might solve issues around government loans to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), Olsen said. Many governments have difficulty tracking the uptake and progress of such programs, and smaller governments have issues distributing loans in the first place.

With the Open Initiative, the ex-CFTC chair wanted to participate in something “very cross-border and very international,” he said.      While blockchain-related technologies are preferred, Lykke hasn’t set any rules as to what kind of technologies applicants propose. Lykke is currently assembling a team of international experts who will serve as a jury to judge each proposal, Olsen added.      “These projects will help the official sector better understand how financial markets are changing marketplaces, changing delivery systems and changing modern life,” Giancarlo said in an interview. “It will also help regulators do better at jobs that have been set out for them by national legislatures and international bodies.”",POSITIVE,없음,COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | RESEARCH,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/05/19/ex-cftc-chair-chris-giancarlo-joins-swiss-effort-to-fund-covid-19-relief-projects,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/82f7202312cf4bdbf3b55b56f4d5257ee4b6b2ff-1280x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42431946,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN81Rh,1589889346,First Mover: Bitcoin Difficulty Adjustment Feels Like Post-Halving Easing Party,"At its core, the Bitcoin blockchain is a sprawling global machine – a human-created network of human-operated computers.      And for bitcoin traders, it's bullish that key events on the blockchain network over the past couple weeks have gone smoothly, showing that the machine is working well. Or, at least, exactly as it was designed.      You're reading First Mover, CoinDesk's daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      On May 11, the Bitcoin blockchain underwent the third ""halving"" in its history, a once-every-four-years occurrence when the pace of new issuance of bitcoin gets automatically cut in half. The much-hyped event passed so unobtrusively that it got panned as anticlimactic, even dull.      Now, bitcoiners are counting down to the next milestone on the blockchain: the latest ""difficulty adjustment,"" expected Tuesday. Occurring roughly every two weeks, it's another automatic mechanism built into the network to keep things operating smoothly. And like the halving it's expected to be uneventful.      ""It's validating that bitcoin is just like a perfect little clock and it just keeps ticking, and we can rely on it,"" Tuur Demeester, founder of Adamant Capital, said in a video interview published Monday by data provider Messari.      Demeester drew a contrast with another human-designed construct, the traditional monetary system, where central banks led by the Federal Reserve this year have unilaterally injected trillions of dollars of coronavirus-related stimulus into the global financial system. The central banks say the moves aim to keep the economy and markets from collapsing, but the officials are effectively just making up monetary policy on the fly.      ""It's just such a contrast with this craziness in the central banking world, where all bets are off,"" Demeester said. ""Who knows what's next?""      Bitcoin prices rose Monday to about $9,700, and are up 36% to date this year. That contrasts with an 8.6% gain in 2020 for the Standard & Poor's 500 Index of large U.S. stocks, even after a rally Monday fueled by optimism that a coronavirus vaccine might be showing signs of promise.      Just like the bitcoin halving had several ""countdown clocks"" erected by cryptocurrency data providers, the difficulty adjustment has its own countdown clock – the Bitcoin Difficulty Estimator.      According to the tool, the difficulty adjustment is supposed to take place Tuesday around 5 p.m. New York time. And it's supposed to make the difficulty of finding new bitcoin about 5 percent easier.      The difficulty adjustment will be the network's first since last week's halving, and its significance this time can't really be understood outside of that milestone.      The new bitcoin produced by the blockchain every day are the rewards for computer operators known as ""miners"" who agree to help maintain the network and keep it secure. So when the rewards were cut by half last week, the miners suffered an immediate reduction in their daily revenue.      True to the incentives built into the bitcoin blockchain, less-efficient and high-cost miners – primarily those with older-generation computers or in regions where electricity is more expensive – dropped off the network, to avoid losing money.      The defections were evidenced by a reduction in the ""hash rate,"" which is the number of new computations sent to the network each second.      Average times to confirm new data blocks increased to about 18 minutes after the halving, well above the 10-minute average targeted in bitcoin's original programming, according to Delphi Digital, a cryptocurrency research firm.      The slowdown caused transactions in the network to back up. That's apparent from a chart of the ""mempool,"" which is the aggregate size in bytes of transactions waiting to be confirmed on the blockchain:      Since transactions got backed up, any senders wishing for faster confirmation times had to increase their fees to get priority. So average transaction fees rose to $4.91 from $2.38, the highest in 11 months, according to Delphi.      This is where Tuesday's difficulty adjustment comes in. By making it easier for miners to find new blocks, the network should automatically bring block times back down to around 10 minutes and ""should result in more mining power coming back on line,"" according to Delphi.      The ""difficulty adjustment should help to clear the log and return the fees to normal,"" Mati Greenspan, founder of the foreign exchange and cryptocurrency analysis firm Quantum Economics, wrote Monday in a note to clients.      Just like clockwork. And refreshingly dull.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $9,770 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,817 | 24-Hr Low: $9,473      Trend: While bitcoin has recovered from lows below $9,500 seen earlier on Tuesday, the immediate bias remains neutral with prices are still trading within Monday's price range.      The top cryptocurrency witnessed two-way business on Monday, printing a high and low of $9,966 and $9,451, respectively, before ending the day (midnight, UTC) on a flat note at $9,720.      Essentially, the cryptocurrency created a ""doji"" candle, comprising of long upper and lower wicks and a small body. The candle is widely considered a sign of indecision in the market place. In such cases, traders usually wait for strong directional bias to emerge in the form of a move outside of the doji's high or low.      So, Monday's doji candle has made Tuesday's UTC close pivotal. A close above the doji candle's high of $9,966 would mean the period of indecision has ended in a bull victory. That could cause more buyers to join the market, leading to a stronger rise toward $10,500.      Alternatively, acceptance under doji's low of $9,451 would confirm a bearish reversal and shift risk in favor of a drop to the 200-day average located at $8,050.      The longer duration indicators like the weekly chart MACD histogram and the 14-week relative strength index are reporting bullish conditions. Additionally, the previous weekly candle violated a long-term descending trendline in favor of continued upward move. As a result, a bullish daily close looks likely.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/19/first-mover-bitcoin-difficulty-adjustment-feels-like-post-halving-easing-party,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/88d1a03109646901431ffd8ef6c639bfe8564d7c-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431940,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN81Nh,1589886820,Bitcoin's Impending Golden Cross May Bolster Bulls: Analysts,"A widely tracked bitcoin price indicator is about to turn bullish – potentially accelerating the recent uptrend of the top cryptocurrency by market value.      The 50-day moving average (MA) of bitcoin’s price looks set to cross above the 200-day MA within two to three days. The resulting ""golden crossover,"" a long-term bull market indicator, would be the first since Feb. 18 and only the seventh in bitcoin’s lifetime, as per CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.      “The golden crossover will catch the attention of classical trend followers,” said Su Zhu, CEO of Three Arrows Capital.      Trend-following traders do not predict or forecast specific levels but simply join the trend (bullish or bearish) when they feel a strong directional bias has been established. They often employ moving average crossover strategies to decide whether a trend is developing. This is because averages, which are based on past data, crowd out the noise created by intraday fluctuations and paint a better picture of the broader trend.      When a short-term MA moves above a long-term MA, a bullish cross is confirmed. That is considered a buy signal by trend followers. Alternatively, a bear cross is taken as a sell signal.      Thus, the impending golden cross, once confirmed, could bring in additional buying pressure from traders who employ MA strategies, leading to stronger price gains.      “I think MA strategies often work because they are self-reinforcing,” said Anthony Vince, head of trading at GSR. That viewpoint has logic as averages follow price and produce a bull cross following notable price gains. Once the cross is confirmed, more buyers join the market, potentially pushing prices higher.      See also: First Mover: Bitcoin Difficulty Adjustment Feels Like Post-Halving Easing Party      Lennard Neo, lead analyst at Stack, also expects the upcoming golden cross to bode well for the cryptocurrency. “Moving averages tend to be one of the best-performing strategies when applied to crypto, at least for the past couple of years. We expect the same to happen in this potential golden cross, as BTC should see some upward price pressure,” said Neo.      Indeed, the golden cross that took place last April yielded more than 130% returns over just a 64-day period. Meanwhile, the golden cross witnessed in October 2015 was followed by a quickfire 64% rally in just eight days.      Some observers, however, are of the opinion that moving average crossovers are lagging indicators and often trap investors on the wrong side of the market. After all, MA studies are based on past data and tend to lag prices.      In the past, there have been instances where the golden crossover turned out to be a bull trap.      ""The last golden cross was confirmed before Black Thursday (March 12) and the last death cross was confirmed before the April rally,"" said Darius Sit, co-founder and managing director at Singapore-based QCP Capital.      “The July 2014 cross for instance, yielded -23% returns from cross up to cross down,” crypto research firm Digital Assets Data told CoinDesk.      So, if history is a guide, golden crossover is an unreliable indicator of price trends.    Different this time?    What makes the upcoming golden cross different from some previous ones is the fact that it is supported by bullish fundamental developments.      The rewards per block mined on bitcoin’s block chain were cut to 6.25 BTC from 12.50 BTC last Monday. Most analysts expect the supply cut to put bitcoin into a long-term bull market, similar to the one seen in the months following the second reward halving, which took place in July 2016.      Additionally, the challenging macro environment brought on by the coronavirus outbreak and the unprecedented monetary stimulus launched by major central banks is expected to boost haven demand for bitcoin.      Hence, some analysts see a low probability of the upcoming bull cross turning out to be a bull trap. “Fundamentals and technicals are lining up well for the markets now, “ said Zhu.      See also: Bitcoin Demand Pushes Tether Below $1 for Longest Stretch Since March      Meanwhile, Neo said that “the fundamentals of bitcoin remain strong, which contemplates every reason for a break upside.”      The on-chain activity does show a strong holding sentiment in the investor community. “The number of bitcoins held on exchanges has been steadily decreasing since the crash in March, and is now approaching a one-year low. This is the largest and most prolonged BTC exchange balance downtrend in Bitcoin's history,” Glassnode, a blockchain intelligence firm, noted in its weekly report.      Investors typically move bitcoins from their wallets to exchanges when they expect prices to drop. On the other hand, coins held on exchanges are withdrawn when the cryptocurrency is expected to see a sustainable price rise.      At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $9,800, representing a 0.6% gain on the day. The cryptocurrency found bids below $9,500 early on Tuesday, but is yet to cross above $10,000. The area around that level has proved a tough nut to crack over the past few days.      With both fundamentals and technicals biased bullish, a move above $10,000 may happen soon. ""A successful break higher and the next significant level overhead would be the 61.8% Absolute Fib at $12,160 area,"" said Eddie Tofpik, head of technical analysis and senior markets analyst at London-based ADM Investor Services International Ltd.      However, over the past few days, the buyers have consistently struggled to keep gains above $9,840, as seen on the daily line chart. ""Another failure there could see the forming of a possible double top and contemplation of the $6,000 area,"" said Tofpik.

According to The Register, the computer processing giant stands accused by a group of shareholders of attempting to pass off the sales of as much as $1 billion in graphics processing units (GPUs) used for cryptocurrency mining as gaming hardware.      The shareholder class suit accuses CEO Jensen Huang, CFO Collette Kress and Jeff Fisher, senior vice president and head of gaming, claiming they knew the spike in GeForce GPU sales was related to the crypto mining boom and could not be sustained over the long term.      The lawsuit dates back to the height of the crypto fervor in 2017, but an amended suit was filed in California last week (see below).      The joint plaintiffs claim the ""defendants opted for a strategy that would capitalize on miners’ fervent demand for GeForce GPUs while falsely telling investors that the spike in GeForce sales came from gamers, not miners."" They then allege the company made it appear its revenue was sheltered from the ups and downs of the cryptocurrency markets.

According to a report by ZDNet, multiple supercomputers across the European Union were compromised by a string of malware attacks that required a shutdown after it was discovered they were being used for crypto mining – also known as cryptojacking. The hackers had gained entry via stolen SSH (remote access) credentials from individuals authorized to operate the machines.      Security researcher Chris Doman, co-founder of Cado Security, told ZDNet the malware was designed to use the supercomputers' processing power to mine monero (XMR). It is also believed a number of the compromised supercomputers were being used to prioritize research for a coronavirus vaccine, although details surrounding the hacks and the computer's purpose appear to have been left deliberately vague.      See also: Cryptojacking Malware Devs Sentenced to 20 Years in Prison      Security incident reports came from Germany, the U.K. and Switzerland, with a potential hijack also said to have occurred at a high-performance computer located in Spain.

""Due to a security exploitation on the ARCHER login nodes, the decision has been taken to disable access to ARCHER while further investigations take place,"" the university announced in a public update.      To date, the ARCHER supercomputer is still down pending further security purges, as well as a reset of its system and passwords. ""The ARCHER and Cray/HPE System Teams continue to work on ARCHER and getting it ready to return to service. We anticipate that ARCHER will be returned to service later this week,"" the university said.    Spate of breaches    Germany-based bwHPC, an organization that coordinates research projects across supercomputers in the state of Baden-Wurttemberg, declared five of its high-performance computing clusters had to be shut down due to similar ""security incidents.""      A supercomputer located in Barcelona, Spain, was also impacted on May 13, with researcher Felix von Leitner declaring in a blog post the computer had a security issue and had to be shut down.

42431936,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN81Dh,1589871600,DTCC Considers DLT Use in Securities Trading With 2 New Studies,"Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), a giant of financial markets infrastructure, is studying whether distributed ledger technology (DLT) could accelerate its processing of securities.      DTCC revealed two projects Monday aimed at integrating DLT with capital markets: Ion, a proof-of-concept alternative settlement service and Whitney, a security token method of private securities issuance and exchange.      Ion in particular envisions a radical future for a company whose already-speedy clearing and settlement pipework routes nearly $2 quadrillion in securities every year – almost the entirety of the U.S. securities market.      Perhaps digitized assets might flow smoother with DLT, DTCC opined in a project brief. It argued that improving the settlement cycle would have cascading benefits for market participants.      Whether DLT is the right answer appears to be a matter DTCC has not yet fully addressed.      By DTCC’s own telling, Ion is a proof-of-concept that has not yet proved its core concept: that DLT can function at scale.      “To effectively convey proposed business concepts, UI/UX was prioritized over a scalable architecture,” DTCC said in the brief. Later in the brief, it said it is looking for the “appropriate technical stack” for Ion.      See also: ASX’s Long-in-the-Works DLT Plan on Ice Amid Coronavirus Concerns      Much closer to functioning prototype – though still likely far from implementation – is DTCC’s Whitney. This project tries to broach the haphazard private securities market with security tokens.      Regulation D securities are not subject to the same rules or party to the same trading infrastructure as their public counterparts. That makes the markets for them far messier, according to Jennifer Peve, managing director of business Innovation at DTCC.      ""The private markets are ripe for increased levels of automation and lack much of the infrastructure that has supported the public markets for decades,” Peve said in a statement. “Project Whitney presents an exciting opportunity to leverage emerging technologies and develop completely new solutions from the ground up.”      DTCC hypothesized that a comprehensive platform security tokens could provide a better private security marketplace. Issuance, distribution and exchange would happen on-chain – as would compliance checks – and everything would also be stored in off chain records, too.      Whitney ran this concept for 12 weeks on the public ethereum network.

Together with Thibault Schrepel, an antitrust academic and Harvard faculty associate, the creator of Ethereum argued in a newly published paper that blockchain and antitrust agencies ""share a common goal"" in stopping the overt centralization of economic clout. In another word: decentralization.      Titled: ""Blockchain Code as Antitrust,"" Buterin and Schrepel argue antitrust agencies promote decentralization by punishing anti-competitive behaviors to prevent ""harmful concentrations,"" similar to a blockchain that puts decentralization at its very core layer of functioning.      See also: Vitalik Buterin Clarifies Remarks on Expected Launch Date of Eth 2.0      But on a more pragmatic level, the report argues that allowing blockchains to flourish will actually benefit antitrust agencies. As anyone can transact on them, irrespective of location, they can create fairer environments in places where there is either ineffective or non-existent antitrust enforcement.      The paper, published Monday, argues that in the short term antitrust agencies – which include bodies such as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in the U.S. – should support initiatives such as sandboxes, sanctified spaces where blockchains can grow and function with less regulatory oversight.      Speaking to CoinDesk, Schrepel elaborated this could include ""not going after the potential anti-competitive practices of blockchains which are designed in a highly decentralized way"" as well as ""not regulating these blockchains too strictly (especially, not their key characteristics).""      See also: The Netherlands’ AMLD5 Interpretation Appears to Be Killing Crypto Firms      In the long term, antitrust agencies could even try and help foster a new regulatory framework for the technology to operate within, including the legal sanctioning of things like sandboxes. The report says this could form part of a process of ""re-conceptualization"" where regulators are directed ""toward technological issues in exchange for not going after other anticompetitive practices.""",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/19/vitalik-buterin-blockchains-will-discourage-monopolies-not-create-them,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/00b773babe1f9d1a45457c8e14bfabbfb5f11caa-2048x1536.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
