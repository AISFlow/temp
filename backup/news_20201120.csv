Shares of the publicly traded bitcoin mining company Riot Blockchainhttps://hashrateindex.com/stocks/riot rose 50% this week, trading hands just below $6.00 at week’s end. Bitcoin gained nearly 17% over the same period.    Riot shares surged even higher in early hours Friday, reaching $6.60, a level not seen since early September 2018.      CoinDesk reported that the Castle Rock, Colo.-based firm posted its lowest per share loss in Q3 since the company fully deployed its cryptocurrency mining infrastructure, over two years ago.      Public mining companies like Riot that emphasize their bitcoin reserves have seen strongly positive reactions from the market, said Ethan Vera, co-founder of Seattle-based mining company Luxor Technology. “Companies that liquidate to fiat every day didn’t see as strong of gains,” he said.      Riot continues to outperform bitcoin through 2020, with investors enjoying a 390% year-to-date return compared to bitcoin’s 168% gain.      The firm plans to continue expanding its already aggressively growing mining capacity through 2021 and beyond, reporting a 450% increase in hash power for Q3 over the same period in 2019, reaching 556 petahash per second (PH/s).      “With the current market momentum many of the mining companies who have never broken a profit will likely report positive EBITDA heading into 2021,” Vera said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING,Zack Voell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/20/bitcoin-miner-riot-blockchain-ends-week-up-50-after-tapping-2-year-highs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/77a03f653974acbb6273942e6bb3016b19ea4d1d-902x621.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433197,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO3gdh,1605907547,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Hits $18.8K as Total Crypto Locked in DeFi Passes $14B,"The price of bitcoin hit new 2020 highs as the “alternative to gold” narrative increases. Meanwhile, smaller crypto tokens might be helping push DeFi to new heights.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $18,638 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 3.5% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $17,723-$18,813 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price made gains Friday, going as high as $18,813, according to CoinDesk 20 data. The world’s oldest cryptocurrency then dropped a bit, to $18,638 as of press time. The last time bitcoin traded at the $18,800 level was back on Dec. 19, 2017, when the price went as high as $18,984.      Some analysts see $19,000 as certainly within reach, but bitcoin won’t shoot straight up getting there, noted John Kramer, a trader at crypto firm GSR. “It feels more and more like we’re hitting a bitcoin tipping point,” Kramer told CoinDesk. “That’s not to say that the price will rocket past $19,000; in fact, a cooldown is to be expected.”      Read More: BlackRock’s Chief Investment Officer Says Bitcoin Could Replace Gold      Despite any cooldown that may occur, bitcoin is certainly hotter than gold so far in 2020, with bitcoin up 147% year to date versus the yellow metal’s 22% performance.      ""I expect a lot more media coverage and reinforcement of the narrative around bitcoin being a better alternative to gold in the near future as more and more prominent Wall Street investors like BlackRock are openly sharing their positive views,” said Jason Lau, chief operating officer for San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange OKCoin.      Read More: Y Combinator, Pantera Backs $3M in New Crypto Derivatives Exchange      Lau was referring to an appearance on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” by Rick Rieder, fixed income CIO at BlackRock, the $7 trillion assert manager. ""Do I think it's a durable mechanism that ... could take the place of gold to a large extent? Yeah, I do, because it's so much more functional than passing a bar of gold around,"" Rieder said of bitcoin during the program.      In the derivatives market, options traders are betting on some bitcoin uncertainty for December expiration. Traders expect a 54% chance of bitcoin staying over $18,000, a 44% chance of $19,000 per 1 BTC and a 35% chance of $20,000.      Denis Vinokourov, head of research at digital asset prime broker Bequant, said many are dismissing the impact ether could have on the derivatives market heading into 2021.      “If one goes by the notion that bitcoin will become a more commonly held asset in traditional space, then there is little that would prevent [ether] in following suit,” Vinokourov told CoinDesk. “Expect the CME to launch ether futures and options in due course, as the current market positioning and flow clearly show growing demand.”    TVL in DeFi going up, but not from BTC, ETH    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Friday, trading around $510 and climbing 7.5% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      The total amount of cryptocurrency “locked” (TVL) in decentralized finance, or DeFi, has passed $14 billion for the first time, at $14.1 billion as of press time.      However, the amount of ETH locked has been declining, perhaps because some stakers are moving the asset over to Ethereum 2.0 contract.      In addition, the amount of bitcoin locked is also dipping in DeFi.      It seems that smaller tokens are seeing major gains along with BTC and ETH, likely contributing to TVL gains, although as of press time DeFi Pulse did not respond to a request for comment on how it accounts for those tokens in its metrics.      “The substantial recent price run-up in ETH and BTC have caused in nominal dollar terms the TVL to balloon as the smaller absolute number of tokens of each is still representing a much larger dollar amount,” noted John Willock, chief executive officer of crypto custody provider Tritium.

42433183,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO3gFh,1605904258,"Central Bankers, Experts Outline Possible Scenarios for CBDC Adoption","Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) can have broad implications for the global balance of power in both finance and politics, but the optimal scenarios for adoption have yet to be found.      These are some of the ideas voiced by the panelists discussing China’s digital yuan project on Wednesday. The panel was arranged by Policy 4.0, a Bangalore, India-based think tank, which has recently released a series of reports on the digital yuan.      The discussion featured Policy 4.0 founder Tanvi Ratna, CoinDesk’s Chief Content Officer Michael Casey, Governor John Rolle of the Central Bank of the Bahamas, Tomasso Mancini Griffoli of the International Monetary Fund, Dave Birch of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF) and the chairman of VeriFi Pindar Wong.      Griffoli outlined three scenarios for adoption for future digital currencies issued by central banks: a limited usage just for remittances, currency substitution for countries with weaker currencies, and a multipolar world using different CBDCs as reserve currencies.    Monetary glitches    The currency substitution scenario would be a continuation of an already ongoing trend, Griffoli said. Some 18% of countries around the world already see half of their population’s deposits in foreign currencies.      The issue here may be the loss of monetary policy control for such countries, “especially in countries where the business cycle is not aligned with the business cycle of the [CBDC] issuing country,” Griffoli said.      At the same time, the issuing country can also face issues if its digital currency gets popular abroad, possibly leading to significant swings in capital inflow, exchange rates, banks’ balance sheets and asset prices.      But Griffoli noted that various countries issuing digital currencies could bring global benefits.      “A greater use of CBDCs can lower cross-border financial frictions, so markets can be deeper and more integrated,” he said. “There is the possibility that rebalancing towards a more multipolar world can be accelerated by the CBDCs, and that can be a good thing.”    Threat for the dollar’s domination    Nations issuing CBDCs should be cognizant of the political implications of CBDC use, said OMFIF’s Birch.      “You can’t pretend that CBDCs don’t have a political component,” Birch said, pointing out that a huge number of U.S. dollars are circulating outside of the U.S. because people around the world use it for savings or for criminal purposes such as money laundering. This, in turn, allows the U.S. to exert significant soft power on other countries, Birch said.      Widespread adoption of CBDCs around the world could reduce the dollar’s domination, leading to unpredictable effects if, for example, those non-dollar CBDCs are used for sanctions evasion, Birch added.      For the countries willing to introduce a CBDC, it’s important to think through the design of such systems. The main goal should not be reducing the cost of transactions – which many countries have already achieved – but creating “a platform for innovation and economic growth,” in which a CBDC might be even not the only kind, but one of the many digital assets integrated into a new-generation payment system, Birch said.      The money of the future will not only be used by humans, and that’s important to consider while designing the CBDCs, said Verifi’s Wong. In the smart cities of the future that are driven by data, we will see “architectures that have people’s money, machine’s money and algorithms’ money,” Wong said.    Digital cash for the Bahamas    For the Bahamas, the issue is no longer an abstract discussion: the country is actively working on issuing its own CBDC. The new payment system should help to better connect the scattered archipelago population financially.      One of the main issues the Central Bank of the Bahamas is trying to solve is how to make the new digital cash available to everyone in the country, includiung the undocumented population immigrating from Haiti, without neglecting know-your-customer and anti-money laundering protocols, Rolle said.      Another important question is data protection, especially for young people who might leave an additional digital financial footprint by using new digital coins.      “We also focus on the education of potential users,” Rolle said, including “understanding how you can be as safe in this space as with cash.”",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/11/20/central-bankers-experts-outline-possible-scenarios-for-cbdc-adoption,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/049f1bed620700f72c62c4816e9030c7901dda7b-2048x1362.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433180,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO3g9h,1605900976,US Government Enlists USDC for 'Global Foreign Policy Objective' in Venezuela: Circle CEO,"Payments startup Circle is getting political.      The stablecoin issuer is working with the U.S. government to bypass Nicolás Maduro and support the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela led by Juan Guaidó.      Circle is using USDC, the dollar-pegged stablecoin it issues with Coinbase, to distribute relief funds to medical workers and other Venezuelan locals, it announced Friday.      CEO Jeremy Allaire told CoinDesk this was his company's first government partnership.      “The partnership, obviously, is with the exiled government,” Allaire said in an interview. “The history here is many countries, including the United States, recognize President-elect Juan Guaidó as the president of Venezuela. Maduro did not accept the results of an election and maintained power.”      Maduro was declared an “usurper” by Venezuela’s national assembly, which named Guaidó the interim president in January 2019, according to BBC News.      “As that happened and sanctions were imposed, funds that belonged to the government were seized,” Allaire said.      The U.S. Treasury Department has been trying to send these funds directly to Venezuelan residents, but this task has been made difficult after Maduro tried blocking the distribution of these funds. Peer-to-peer payments startup Airtm has been working to solve this issue, with limited results so far.      Allaire declined to identify which part of the U.S. government is working with Circle and Airtm, but said Circle had been licensed to distribute funds using USDC.      According to the company's blog post, the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve deposit funds seized by the U.S. into a bank account in the U.S. tied to the Guaidó government, which converts the funds into USDC that Circle then sends to Airtm.    How it works    Airtm has a business account with Circle under the terms of the arrangement. Funds flow through Circle to Airtm, which can then distribute USDC to any of its mobile digital wallet users. Airtm currently has “half a million users in Venezuela,” Allaire said.      “This is, in a sense, a way to bypass the state-controlled banking system and just directly distribute to people,” Allaire said, adding:    “This, I believe, marks really a first where the U.S. is effectively executing a global foreign policy objective with stablecoins for foreign aid because the existing dollar banking system can’t do the job.”    By using USDC, these Venezuelans can spend in dollars, which are currently far more stable than Venezuela’s native bolivar, he said. The bolivar has seen 2,358.5% inflation in 2020 alone.      Read more: Here in Venezuela, Doctors Struggle to Access Aid From Crypto Platform      Like with Airtm’s previous efforts, all local residents need to receive the stablecoins is a mobile phone and some way of accessing the internet.      “In this case, because it’s a dictatorship, you also have a VPN and you have digital currency. You can go over the top of the internet and bypass those controls,” Allaire said.

Institutional buyers are loading up on BTC puts, Deribit analysts say. Goldman Sachs thinks the “digital yuan” could be in a billion hands in a decade.    Top shelf    BlackRock Squawks A top BlackRock executive, in charge of where the world’s largest asset manager invests its fund, said that bitcoin could take the place of gold, because it is “so much more functional than passing a bar of gold around.” Appearing on CNBC's Squawk Box, BlackRock CIO of Fixed Income Rick Rieder also said, ""I think cryptocurrency's here to stay, I think it is … durable."" While this is a vote of confidence of digital payment systems, and a leading bitcoin ""narrative"" as an inflation hedge, Rieder said he's not particularly a bitcoin bull and doesn't include it much in business and corporate portfolios. Further, it's not clear if bitcoin is worth its current price of over $18,000 price, he said.      Options, options Investors are buying bitcoin put options, possibly signaling future volatility or a market drawdown. The one-month implied volatility, which is influenced by the demand for call and put options, jumped from roughly 55% to a four-month high of 70.5% in the past two days, suggesting increased expectations for price turbulence over the next four weeks. Further, Deribit Insights found several institutions have bought put options. This doesn’t necessarily signal a correction, CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reports, “but could be a hedging strategy against a long or bullish position in the spot market.”      Taproot support Bitcoin mining pools representing over 54% of the network’s current hashrate have signaled support for the scaling and privacy protocol upgrade Taproot, merged into Bitcoin Core last month. Bitmain’s Antpool backed the protocol upgrade Thursday morning, joining five other pools in a collective Taproot Activation initiative. Taproot aims to improve transaction privacy and enhance Bitcoin’s smart contract functionality. It’s also designed to keep Bitcoin’s blocks small, with block space as accessible as possible.      1B users Goldman Sachs analysts think China's digital yuan could account for 15% of total consumption payments in 10 years. “In ten years we expect DC/EP to reach 1 billion addressable users, 1.6 trillion rmb ($229 billion) in issuance, 19 trillion rmb ($2.7 trillion) in annual Total Payment Value (TPV) and account for 15% of total consumption payments,” a Nov. 17 report reads. This gain in users could help commercial banks gain back ground from fintech companies, which currently dominate the payment scene in China.      Star struck Mingxing “Star” Xu, founder of OKCoin and CEO of OK Group, has been reportedly been released from detention by Chinese authorities. According to a report by Bloomberg Thursday, Xu appeared on a private social media platform to post that he had been cooperating with an investigation relating to an equity merger that OK Group had finalized years prior. “The authorities have clarified the matter and proved me innocent,” Xu wrote Friday on his WeChat feed.

Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency has jumped to 28-month highs, taking year-to-date gains to nearly 290%, CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reports. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market value crossed above $500 this morning around 9:00 UTC, pushing it to the highest price level since July 18, 2018, according to the CoinDesk 20. Ether is now 185% short of its record high of $1,433.    At stake    Data costs Filecoin, the decentralized storage network incubated by Protocol Labs, has seen explosive growth a month following its mainnet. Since going live in mid-October, the network has surpassed one exabyte of storage capacity.      An exabyte is equal to 1,000 petabytes, or about 15 Library of Congresses (at last count). Filecoin’s blockchain-based network creates a market for data storage by enabling users to rent out unused storage space to those looking to backup their data.      When first pitching the idea, Protocol Lab CEO Juan Benet said, ""They laughed at me directly, saying, 'You'll never get a decentralized network to exceed a few petabytes, maybe 10 petabytes,'” at Decrypt's Around the Campfire virtual conference Thursday. So, to achieve an exabyte is a real achievement.      To be sure, not all of this information came online in just the past month. The Filecoin team has been seeding the network with various experiments over the past year, including sending out physical hard drives of data to likely miners and launching an incentivized testnet called Space Race, which was ported over into the live version of Filecoin.      Like other blockchains, Filecoin creates immutable versions of select types of data. For some, this may raise environmental concerns – especially considering how much of the internet appears to be dark and redundant, obsolete and trivial (ROT).      Addressing these concerns during the conference, Benet said Filecoin’s environmental concerns are “not very deep relative to other computing systems.” He mentioned Bitcoin, which is often criticized for consuming a vast amount of energy to power its consensus model, and said Filecoin’s consumption is a “tiny fraction.”      And, considering it does “something useful” in storing data, it might be a price worth paying.

42421784,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXqDfB,1605893883,Bitcoin Is the Biggest Big Short,"Short-sellers, who make money when the price of a targeted financial instrument declines, aren’t always popular with corporate or government leaders. Those on the receiving end of contrarian bets against stocks or currencies tend to portray them as sharks undermining people striving to build, grow and create value.  This, if you’ll excuse the pun, is short-sighted.  Short-selling is a necessary part of any functioning, efficient financial system. It provides liquidity, ensuring there’s a seller on the other side of each bid. And when viewed in totality, those occasions where the short-seller ends up winning offer invaluable signals on how society should better allocate resources.  I say this because at a time when its price is again soaring, bitcoin should essentially be viewed as a massive short position against the entire financial system. (Even bigger than the “The Big Short.”)  Bitcoin is more than a hedge against inflation. Indeed, amid an extended period of historically low rates of increase in the consumer price index, there’s currently no clear correlation between bitcoin’s rising price and mainstream measures of inflation.  Rather, bitcoin’s core value lies in its decentralized governance design being divorced from the political system, a feature no other asset of its size and liquidity can claim, perhaps with the exception of gold.  Its positioning against inflation is an outcome of that, not its essence. If people lose confidence in their government’s capacity to sustain the trusted, social covenant on which fiat money is founded, the value of that money collapses, resulting in hyperinflation. Because of its depoliticized status, bitcoin gains in value in that environment.  So if you’re long bitcoin, you are positioned to benefit if the system of governance on which the entire world depends for security and well-being collapses. Still feel good about it?  I’m here to tell you it’s OK. Just as short-sellers of stocks have not destroyed the stock market, neither will bitcoin investors bring down that system.  Instead, what they’ll do, I hope, is pressure policymakers to reform the system in ways that better serve their constituents and sustain the social covenant of money.  Reading the signals  I don’t know about you, I like thinking the success of a long-bitcoin bet can lie in driving a constructive improvement in the incumbent system rather than destroying it entirely. After too many episodes of “The Walking Dead,” I can say with assurance that dystopia is not for me.  But let’s be clear: Bitcoin’s nice fat gains do reflect people’s rising fear that our century-old governance model for the global financial system is failing.  There are reasons: unsustainable debt levels; anemic growth despite masses of quantitative easing; economic inequality; the COVID-19 shock; and how, in a decentralized, social media information system where truth is being questioned, people sense a loss of agency in their and their communities’ lives.  Part of the problem is that elite conversations around the solutions are mired in the assumption the old system of government will continue as is. This feeds an expectation of failure, which bit by bit leads more and more people to believe that, even if they’re not “all in” on a bet against that system, they should hold some bitcoin in case the worst arises.  With all of that just-in-case hedging activity, the global short position grows and bitcoin’s price rises.  We need policymakers to recognize what those market signals are telling them: that the existing model is both failing and fragile. Currently, they do not. Let’s hope they get it soon because we all should care that the solution is not violent, destructive revolution but constructive evolution.  A new reserve asset  This is not an anti-establishment argument. It’s most definitely not an endorsement of the nihilistic ethos of Trumpism.  It’s a call to recognize that bailouts (socialized corporate losses) and monetary stimulus (put options for stock market speculators) have papered over deep problems in the economy and done little to raise the happiness of the world’s citizenry. It’s saying we need a new approach to secure an effective market economy, one that empowers everybody to seize opportunities on a level playing field.  And if we achieve that, if the national government-run system evolves to a point where it regains popular support, what role does bitcoin play in that modified system? What is its larger purpose beyond being a hedge against systemic meltdown? It’s hard to see where the sustained value would lie in an asset whose only purpose is to hedge against that worst-case outcome if that outcome doesn’t eventuate.  I think bitcoin’s purpose lies in it becoming a kind of societal reserve asset.  This is a concept beyond both the ideas of a government-held reserve currency and of gold’s long-running status as a citizens’ hedge against monetary meltdown. The early elements of it can be seen in how bitcoin has been incorporated into decentralized finance (DeFi) as a kind of uber form of collateral.  While we might not use bitcoin to buy cups of coffee, for which dollars or yen or something else will suffice, it could become a fundamental store of digital value upon which the overarching financial system rests.  Right now, if you look at the global bond market, that role is occupied by U.S. Treasury bills, notes and bonds. Those U.S. government debt instruments provide the base-layer collateral upon which Wall Street has built a hierarchical system by which financial institutions extend all other forms of credit to the outside world.  But in the future, once crypto ownership and market participation is sufficiently wide and digital asset markets are sufficiently liquid and sophisticated that price volatility declines, bitcoin could play a similar role. Its protocol-assured scarcity, along with its programmable qualities and its future capacity to interoperate with central bank digital currencies, stablecoins and other digital assets, will ultimately make for a superior underlying store of value than anything a trust-compromised government can offer up.  Don’t be distracted by strong worldwide demand for dollars. Confidence in the U.S. government-led global financial system is eroding, as the bitcoin short position itself demonstrates. Once that loss of trust reaches a tipping point, society will need another form of base-layer collateral to replace U.S. government debt.  Therein lies a post-crisis role for the world’s most important cryptocurrency.  Podcast: stablecoins in Africa and South America  This week’s accompanying Money Reimagined podcast looks at the adoption of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins in emerging markets, which over the past year has seen real signs of life. Is this finally the moment to realize one of the great hopes of this technology: to enable financial empowerment in developing countries where traditional finance is constrained?  To explore that question, my co-host Sheila Warren and I are joined by Elizabeth Rossiello, the founder and CEO of AZA, which has for seven years been developing digital payment solutions in African markets, and Sebastian Serrano, the founder and CEO of Ripio, which has been doing similar work in Latin America for more or less the same amount of time.  Joe Six-Pack, where are you?  It has been a huge week for bitcoin, whose price is now closing in on the all-time high it hit in 2017 and whose market capitalization has already surpassed the high of that period. But in one very important way, this rally is quite different from that of three years ago. There’s a relative absence of the “FOMO” crowd, the retail investors who don’t want to miss out on the big winnings others are enjoying. And the following chart gives a pretty good representation of that. Unlike 2017, Google search activity around the term “bitcoin” – a proxy for the curiosity of the general population – has hardly budged from the levels of the past few years, even as the price has surged.  Instead of the retail investor commentary, this time the news around this up-cycle is dominated by big-name, deep-pocketed investors discovering bitcoin. It involves people like MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor, hedge fund veteran Stanley Druckenmiller, Citibank analyst Tom Fitzpatrick and, earlier today, BlackRock CIO for Fixed Income, Rick Rieder, who hinted on CNBC that the world’s largest asset manager, with more than $7 trillion under management, now sees bitcoin as a better hedge than gold. This is a Wall Street rally, in other words, not a Main Street rally.  “Once bitten twice shy” may be the reason retail investors are sitting on the sidelines this time. Too many people lost their shirts by piling into the trade at the peak of the 2017 bubble. Another may be that without the initial coin offering (ICO) boom that fueled an accompanying surge in hundreds of ERC-20 tokens alongside bitcoin, the buzz around the crypto rally generally isn’t as loud.  But I think it’s also worth recognizing the logic of the rally is quite different. This one comes amid a backdrop of concern about the outlook for inflation, fiscal debt and political stability. Those concerns are being addressed by professional investors who are taking a long-term look at bitcoin’s potential as a hedge against all that (as per the column above.) This is less of a get-rich-quick rally, and more of an insurance play.  That’s not to say those bigwigs aren’t also looking to make a killing. It’s also not to say that at some point this “professional” rally doesn’t excite another round of FOMO among the masses. While some investors are starting to protect themselves against a correction, the fact that Joe Six-Pack has yet to jump in could suggest there’s still upside in this for bitcoin.  Global town hall  DIFFERENT KIND OF SAME. “Innovation” is a magic buzzword that conveys progress and daring. That quality makes it ideal for obfuscation. Case in point: a piece on the website of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF) this week with the title “The second wave of central bank policy innovation.”  If you’re looking for descriptions of radical new digital currency projects in places like the Bahamas, Thailand and China, you won’t find them in this report. What’s meant by “innovation” here is a variety of new means by which central banks are really just extending an existing playbook into new areas, specifically by buying a wider array of assets to pump money into their financial systems. It’s a more extreme, riskier version of the same new policy “tool” that arose after interest rates had been pushed to near zero after the 2008 crisis: quantitative easing.  The problem with endless “QE” is central banks are running out of government bonds to buy; fiscal debt issuance calendars can’t keep up. So, to keep the money expansion going, they are reaching into riskier asset classes, including municipal and corporate bonds. The U.S. Federal Reserve has set the example with its Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility, with which it buys corporate debt, and with a separate program for buying municipal bonds. Now, we learn from OMFIF that after the Bank of England “introduced a term funding scheme for small- and medium-sized enterprises” in March, the same model has been adopted by central banks in Australia, Taiwan, New Zealand and elsewhere.  With these schemes, central banks, which are supposed to be politically independent, become creditors to entities whose interests can be politicized. If these new debtors face default in the post-COVID debt reckoning, they will be tempted to call on the support of politicians they’ve backed to pressure the central bank to forgive or restructure those debts. This is what will ultimately undermine fiat currencies. Those bonds, now sitting garishly on central banks’ balance sheets as private or political assets, are supposed to more than offset the principal liability: the monetary base. Politicizing those assets will raise concerns about their future value, which will weaken confidence in the currency.  So, whereas the OMFIF piece says these efforts show that “Central banks have shown a continued willingness to reinvent their monetary policy toolkits,” you could equally say they’ve shown a continued willingness to double down a 10-year old bet that’s reached the end of its usefulness.  ELITE FACTORIES. Biologists offer a unique perspective on complex systems such as economies. In studying how ecosystems and species populations can reach breaking points caused by dynamics of the supply and consumption of resources, they find patterns that human societies tend to mimic over time. In that context, the latest observations by Peter Turchin, a pine beetle expert turned cultural theorist, are somewhat alarming.  As laid out by Graeme Wood in The Atlantic, Turchin believes the hierarchies in Western societies like the U.S. are fueling tensions due to an “overproduction of elites.” Societies that have geared their education and professional systems toward rewarding a privileged but relatively large minority are struggling to find constructive uses for them, while the majority who lie outside of that elite bubble have no upward mobility.  This, Turchin suggests, is the root cause of the angst playing out in events such as the still unresolved 2020 election. It’s leading to a breakdown in trust and the failure of institutions.  What does this have to do with cryptocurrencies and blockchains? Well, in theory at least, those systems are supposed to reward people for their participation in open-source, collaborative development and, in their purest form, require no identification to participate. Crypto-based bug bounties, for example, can reward whichever developer finds vulnerabilities in software code without consideration of their identity or educational credentials.  To think a blockchain development community is utopian is, however, naive. There are all sorts of ways in which the privilege of circumstance and upbringing rewards certain people and not others. It is no accident that the vast majority of crypto engineers are white males. It’s a product of a societally formed superstructure – the very same hierarchical system that Turchin said is powering toward its own oblivion. The trick is to figure how to take the best of these open development models while proactively seeding them with newcomers from outside the existing elite production facilities at top-ranking universities.  THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG. The debt crisis fueled by the COVID-19 shutdowns remains in suspended animation. It will get worse once stop-gap measures like rent suspension and mortgage forbearance run out next year as stretched creditors start to demand what is theirs.  In fact, as shown by this Wall Street Journal examination of the U.S. government’s aggressive Payroll Protection Program loans to small businesses, the fallout may already be starting. The reporters found that “about 300 companies that received as much as half a billion dollars in pandemic-related government loans have filed for bankruptcy.”  These numbers will surely rise. And as any student of debt crisis knows, bankruptcies beget bankruptcies. Each debtor’s default leaves their creditors with less funds to pay their debts. A self-perpetuating cycle takes hold.  I think this looming problem is the core driver of why big-name investors are gravitating toward bitcoin. Governments the world over will be confronted with delayed bailout demands far bigger than those they’ve already faced. Can they afford to raise taxes to pay for those bailouts? Hardly. So, many will call on their central banks to do even more than they’re already doing to try to keep their economies afloat. (See the column and the item above for why that will be problematic.) The social covenant of money is at stake. Bitcoin offers an alternative.  Well, that’s a gloomy GTH this week! (My editor, Ben Schiller, suggests rebranding the section to “Apocalypse Watch.”) Sadly, soaring bitcoin prices tend to correlate with bad news for everyone but crypto investors.

The Dark Future Where Payments Are Politicized and Bitcoin Wins. I really don’t mean to take issue with JP Koning regularly. He is truly an excellent writer whose clear, BS-free thinking on money adds great perspective to our understanding of how it is evolving. But this is the second week running I feel compelled to counter one of his CoinDesk columns. As I lay out in this week’s column, I think it’s overly alarmist to assume that the only way bitcoin “wins” is for society to go into dystopian meltdown. It’s not an all-or-nothing bet. This is, as always, a good read, though.  Lightning Network’s New Liquidity Marketplace Attracts a ‘Surprising’ Mix of Individuals, Enterprises. The Lightning network has long been promised as a “layer 2” solution to increase the throughput and lower the cost of bitcoin transactions by removing them from the space-constrained main blockchain.

Now, it looks like there’s a decentralized system for resolving those moments when the bitcoin isn’t there. Colin Harper reports.  CoinDesk Daily News.

42433194,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO3gbh,1605893714,First Mover: Bitcoin ‘Rich List’ Grows as Whales HODL and Price Retakes $18K,"Bitcoin reached fresh 35-month highs above $18,400 during the European trading hours. The cryptocurrency has failed to keep gains above $18,000 in the previous two trading days. It will be interesting to see if prices establish a foothold above that level on Friday.      ""The market showed a lot of resilience and dip buying interest to shake off any immediate questions about the sustainability of the recent upside. So much so, that bitcoin has moved back above the $18,000 level and remains on track to retest the highs from earlier on in the week,"" Denis Vinokourov, head of research at the London-based prime brokerage Bequant said.      Other cryptocurrencies also rallied, with ether penetrating the psychological hurdle of $500 for the first time since July 2018.      In traditional markets, European stocks advanced, ignoring the fading prospect of additional U.S. fiscal stimulus and rising coronavirus crises. U.S. stock futures, however, dropped and gold eked out gains as the Treasury secretary announced plans to let several of Federal Reserve's emergency lending programs expire on Dec. 31.    Market moves    Bitcoin has climbed for seven straight weeks, the longest streak since early 2017, when prices began their push toward the all-time-high near $20,000 in December of that year. And crypto traders are wondering how long this latest rally can last.      The move higher started in early October when prices were around $10,700, and bitcoin is now changing hands around $18,000. On a year-to-date basis, the cryptocurrency has gained an astounding 150%, the most since the 14-fold gains witnessed in 2017.      The ascent has been so rapid and powerful that analysts are starting to use terms like ""parabolic,"" where increases turn exponential.      ""Bitcoin's recent continuous uptrend displays stark similarities to the 2017 bull run, where a parabolic trend took it up to $20,000,"" Lennard Neo, head of research for the cryptocurrency-focused structured-products firm Stack Funds, wrote Thursday in a weekly report.      For clues on what comes next, some cryptocurrency analysts are looking to data extracted from the blockchain, making inferences about what types of buyers are coming into the market, and who's selling, if anyone.      Those indicators appear to show just how few investors are willing to part with their bitcoin, even with signs mounting that a growing number of big institutional fund managers from traditional markets are seduced by the outsize gains, during a year when few other trades appear to be producing big wins. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index of large U.S. stocks is up 11% this year, and fixed-income returns are hard to come by, with 10-year Treasury notes yielding less than 1%.      ""Bitcoin’s price is rising because demand for [b]itcoin is increasing at a time when there’s relatively few bitcoin available to buy,"" the blockchain data firm Chainalysis wrote Thursday in a report.      The firm produced a chart tracking what appear to be ""investor-held"" wallets – those whose coins rarely if ever move – versus ""trader-held"" wallets, where sales take place more frequently. The number of bitcoin in trader-held wallets, or those theoretically more likely to take profits as prices rise, has declined this year. The amount of investor-held bitcoin, meanwhile, has risen steadily.      Another blockchain data firm, CryptoQuant, is tracking bitcoin ""whales"" – those accounts big enough to send a giant sell order to an exchange, typically swamping buy orders from smaller traders.      The ""exchange whale ratio,"" calculated by dividing the value of the largest 10 deposits on exchanges by the total amount of deposits, is currently below the 90% level, which would signal an extreme likelihood that a big price drop is looming. The gauge currently sits around 85%, where ""the chance of prices continuing to rise is high,"" CryptoQuant wrote Thursday in an email.      ""Looking at the movement of whales, it appears that the rise in prices will continue,"" according to the report.      Hong Fang, CEO of the San Francisco-based crypto exchange OKCoin, wrote Thursday in an op-ed for CoinDesk Opinion that ""the burning question is whether bitcoin is becoming overpriced.""      She argued that it's not unreasonable to expect a price around $100,000 next year, assuming 1%-2% of total U.S. household wealth of $112 trillion gets allocated to bitcoin.      ""This is a timing risk,"" she wrote. ""It is quite possible that it may take much longer than expected for bitcoin to go mainstream.""      The whales represent a shorter-term threat. If bitcoin continues its parabolic rise, they might come splashing around.      - Bradley Keoun    Bitcoin watch    Bitcoin's rich list, or the number of addresses holding at least 1,000 BTC, continues to rise along with the price, suggesting increased interest from institutions and high-net-worth investors.      The metric recently reached a record high of 2,237, marking a 5.6% increase on a year-to-date basis, according to data source Glassnode. The rich list has grown by over 2.5% alongside bitcoin's rice from $10,000 to $18,000 seen in the past six weeks.      A single person can hold multiple addresses. Crypto exchanges also store coins belonging to traders in multiple addresses. As such, the rich list is not an accurate metric of increased institutional participation or user adoption.      That said, there is strong reason to believe the recent rise in the number of large addresses is the result of influx of high-net-worth individuals. Several public companies such as MicroStrategy and Square have made a foray into the bitcoin market in the past eight weeks or so.      With strong hands backing the price rally, the cryptocurrency looks set to challenge record highs before the year-end, as anticipated by some analysts.

The platform announced Friday a $3 million funding round from the likes of Pantera Capital, Y Combinator, Tim Draper and others.      “We’re seeing a wave of interest in crypto assets from major banks, fintech companies and portfolio managers,” said Pantera partner Paul Veradittakit. “Globe has built the platform and products that these sophisticated market players need and expect.”      The bells and whistles 100x leverage on DeFi perpetuals, a product built around a prominent crypto volatility index and other features.      “Globe is on a mission to unlock frictionless access to global alpha for everyone,” said CEO James West, adding:    “We’re building solid infrastructure, solving the overload problems that have wrecked the fortunes of so many traders, pushing up the standards of integrity in the space and building out new products – like VIX – that traders like ourselves want to see.”    Following the regulatory problems seen on existing exchanges, Globe hopes to deliver a safe and fair platform for fresh institutional capital to enter the space, he added.      “The Globe team has been building quietly and we think now’s the perfect time for them, with incumbents like BitMEX facing new challenges and DeFi catching the attention of sophisticated market players,” Pantera’s Franklin Bi said via email.      Silicon Valley accelerator Y Combinator saw success in picking Coinbase as an early bet (among a number of other crypto-sector investments).

Cryptocurrency associated with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)-compliant plans will be held in New York-regulated Gemini Trust's cold storage custody.

Companies can switch to the bitcoin plans from their current provider if desired.

Winning Poker Network, which operates a number of online poker sites, said it has been forced to buy millions in bitcoin a day to meet the demands of exiting players.      As reported by Bloomberg on Thursday, 90%–95% of Winning Poker's payouts are in bitcoin because of the recent price rise, said the company's CEO, Phil Nagy. “We are constantly having to go out and buy bitcoin, lots. Lots. More than we’ve even had to before.”      See also: Bitcoin Options Investors Are Starting to Hedge Against Potential Price Pullback      According to Nagy, the business is clocking over 60% of its transaction volume in bitcoin, roughly $100 million a month. Geographically, the majority of the bitcoin demand derives from the U.S., despite online poker being illegal in most states.      So far this year, bitcoin's price has risen 155%, buoyed by bullish cryptocurrency fundamentals, inflation of fiat currencies and the global coronavirus pandemic.      Nagy noted his company doesn't hold bitcoin, instead preferring to convert to fiat without delay due to the digital asset's volatility. However, he also said that when bitcoin is down, players will pay with the cryptocurrency as a way to liquidate quickly, meaning his company has been ""kind of stuck with it.""",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TRADING,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/20/players-prefer-cashing-out-in-bitcoin-amid-rally-says-online-poker-giant,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/973ae05ebfe9b7aaee8bba1c14af93062d77e69c-2046x1174.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The equity investee was the target of a ""complicated"" legal case, Xu said, choosing not to go into further detail.

A report in Chinese newspaper Ciaxin said the key holder was Xu, based on sources ""close to"" the company.      Xu's temporary detention and subsequent release closely coincides with the period the mystery key holder also became unavailable. The exchange said Thursday it would restart withdrawals by next Friday because the key holder had been released from ""assisting the authorities"" and ""has now returned to his normal business functions.""

MUFG and Akamai aim to provide cheaper and more efficient payment services via their joint venture Global Open Network (GO-NET). The network will integrate payment terminals from electronic device manufacturer Seiko Holdings with the bank’s credit card company MUFG NICOS in February, CoinDesk Japan reported. GO-NET initially announced the launch of the payment services to be in the first half of 2020.      The network also plans in July of next year to start a service allowing customers to buy canned and bottled beverages at some vending machines in Japan by placing a credit card on a machine reader. GO-NET said its payment platform can process 100,000 transactions per second, which exceeds Visa's processing capacity of about 70,000 per second. According to GO-NET, the platform can be expanded to reach as high as 10 million transactions per second for small payments.      Read more: ZenGo Joins Visa Fast Track Program to Get Non-Custodial Crypto Card Off the Ground      Founded in May 2018, GO-NET is a joint venture between MUFG and Akamai, with the bank owning 80% of the firm’s stake. The collaboration between the two companies in developing the payment platform started as early as 2016, according to CoinDesk Japan.      While MUFG can leverage its existing financial services to increase the adoption of the network, Akamai helps GO-NET build its infrastructure with around 280,000 servers in 136 countries and the blockchain technology that comes with a native wallet.      MUFG has been working on its own digital currency, MUFG Coin, for several years. It is unclear if the blockchain payment network is related to the bank’s coin initiative.
