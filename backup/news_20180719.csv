42381062,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93Pin,1532035802,You Can't Ban Math: Crypto Unites to Call Out Congressman,"In the span of a few hours, it became Crypto Twitter vs U.S. Representative Brad Sherman.  On Wednesday, Congress hosted a pair of back-to-back hearings on the topic of cryptocurrencies (read CoinDesk's coverage here and here), which notably saw Rep. Sherman – no stranger to controversy among crypto circles – call again for a blanket ban on ""buying or mining cryptocurrencies.""  And while Sherman is just one lawmaker among more than 400, social media observers quickly turned their sights on the California Democrat. For example, Sherman was accused of bias because his largest donor this past election cycle is a credit card payments firm based in Los Angeles (where his district, California's 30th Congressional, is based).  Sherman's declaration – and indeed, the wider social conversation around the twin hearings – led to a boost for the #CryptoCongress hashtag. According to data from Twitter analytics site Keyhole, the hashtag had a reach of over 1 million accounts and more than 2.7 million impressions from the start of the hearings yesterday to today.  As for Sherman himself, whether the member of Congress has any remarks on the hubbub remains to be seen – as of press time, Sherman's office hadn't responded to a request for comment.  From the moment that Sherman issued his remarks, the response was, to put it bluntly, unsparing:  And as might be expected, the oft-used criticism that the U.S. government is endlessly printing dollars came to the fore (likely in light of Sherman's partial focus on mining, a process by which units of cryptocurrency are created).  Some of the harshest words came in the form of accusations of a conflict of interest, given the Allied Wallet connection.  A few of them even probed deeper into this matter, highlighting how Allied, back in 2010, forfeited $13.3 million to the U.S. government as part of a settlement over payments linked to illegal online gambling.  But could the uproar lead to actual political repercussions for the California Democrat? In the wake of the hearing, the hashtag #UnseatSherman2018 began to appear, and several observers claiming to be from the Golden State said that they wouldn't vote for him in the next election.  What's resoundingly clear is that the crypto social sphere – often a scene of acrimony and sniping over a variety of subjects – largely came together in light of Sherman's remarks.  As the saying goes, ""having an enemy is a great way to unite a community.""

42381060,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93Pf1,1532033128,Barclays Seeks Twin Blockchain Patents for Banking Services,"Barclays Bank may be looking to blockchain to streamline fund transfers and know-your-customer processes, according to newly-released patent applications.  The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office published two applications by the U.K.'s second-largest bank Thursday, both of which revolve around account security. Perhaps most notably, however, was an application for a patent which outlined a blockchain-platform which could facilitate cryptocurrency transfers. The bank also proposed streamlining know-your-customer processes by storing identifying information on a private blockchain.  Though the existence of a patent application does not necessarily mean the bank is planning to develop any products with the technology, the releases indicate members of the bank are examining the nascent technology.  As one document explains:  ""The use of a block chain provides at least several benefits. These include its public nature, allowing any other party or entity from viewing the data and cryptographic verification of the data enabled by the digital signatures, hashing and layered nature of the block chain. The transaction is a complete and verified unit of data in a form that may be added to the block chain ... Further or duplicate checks and work may be avoided, which can improve the efficiency of computer networks.""  As such, Barclays' proposal would provide ""a more reliable form of verification without substantially increasing technical overheads and improves the operation of computing environments and telecommunications networks.""  And that's not all. The application details a ""super"" user authority, which would have the right to migrate old information to present blocks, and perhaps even delete old ones with sufficient support from other user authorities in the system. This use could theoretically mitigate blockchain size and storage issues.  The other patent is even more direct - it suggests generating a blockchain to transfer ""digital currency from a payer to a recipient.""

42381049,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93PTh,1532029066,It Took Just A Day for Tron's Founder to Win His Own Blockchain's Election,"An unconventional candidate has triumphed in tron's ongoing blockchain elections: its own founder Justin Sun.  After announcing his candidacy to become a tron ""super representative"" (a node on the software elected by token holders to validate transactions, create blocks in the network and compete for its rewards) just one day ago, Sun has successfully garnered enough votes to run one of just 27 nodes that will operate the $2.5 billion tron network.  As of press time, Sun had acquired over 120 million votes according to tron's Tronscan feature. Candidates must receive over 100 million votes to be elected, with each TRX counting for one vote. (For context, it took other candidates several days to a week to be elected, and only 11 representatives have been elected thus far.)  As reported by CoinDesk, tron kicked off its election in June as part of the launch of its own proprietary blockchain. The project was originally meant to run on the ethereum blockchain, and is currently in the process of migrating its TRX tokens from that network to its new platform.  Sun wrote in his Wednesday announcement on Twitter:  ""I hope that my candidacy will make all the TRX holders, supporters and believers see the significance embedded in voting. I hope it will enable all of us to contribute to the establishment of a truly democratic, decentralized tron community.""  Sun's decision was not wholly unexpected, as it was foreshadowed in an April Medium post in which he wrote, ""I myself will participate in the tron super representative election along with all other candidates.""  Later, Sun clarified in his statement that his candidacy was ""a completely personal action"" and will not represent the Tron Foundation, of which he is the CEO. He previously promised that the foundation would not use its 34 billion tokens to vote in the election, though he did not disclose his personal TRX holdings in the announcement.  At the time, Sun largely sought to downplay the potential impact that his influence in the community could have on the election. ""I am determined to go through the selection process like everyone else, which displays tron's inclusiveness and openness as a decentralized and autonomous community,"" he said.  Unlike other super representative candidates, Sun did not publish an election ""manifesto,"" which typically contains information on the candidates and the hardware they plan to use to run the node.  New 'democracy'  Still, tron's ongoing election is part of a broader trend among public blockchains, one that finds notable projects experimenting with novel ways to coordinate stakeholders to update the software.  Most recently, neo, the 12th largest blockchain by total value, saw its founders take on a prominent, almost exclusive, role in its election, despite claims the process was decentralized or democratic.  As such, Sun's announcement was greeted with some skepticism by tron users. ""Hey Justin that's not good for us, this is unprofessional,"" one Twitter user commented on Sun's post.  A Reddit user questioned Sun's rhetoric of democracy, commenting: ""Create democracy. People love it. Huge media presence and influence. People love you. Run for head office. Everyone follows. Easy win. Now in control of said democracy. Seem strange? No? I give up.""  Others suggested that Sun's candidacy would bolster criticism of the project, which was previously accused of plagiarizing its white paper and failing to properly attribute code in its Github repository.  However, with the results only recently concluded, it remains to be seen whether the move will have any lasting impact on the project, which after making global headlines by acquiring BitTorrent in June, remains one of the more prominent to have emerged over the last year.  The Tron Foundation and Justin Sun did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

42381050,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93PWD,1532019647,Ethereum Scaling Solution Raiden Releases Last Testnet Before Launch,"A new test network has been launched for Raiden, the ethereum payments channel project.  Announced at the Dappcon developer conference in Berlin on Thursday, the release features a minimal implementation of the scaling solution that will allow ethereum tokens to be traded on off-chain payment channels. Notably, this particular testnet will be the final one to battle-test the tech before it goes live for everyday users.  ""It's the first step towards going to the mainnet,"" Lefteris Karapetsas, core developer of the project, told CoinDesk.  While Raiden saw a testnet deployment late last year, Karapetsas said the new release is an early implementation of the mainnet release itself and features newly rewritten smart contract code and payment channels that are recoverable in the case of an accidental closure.  Presenting the release at Dappcon, Karapetsas urged developers to use the testnet to help discover any potential bugs. A bounty program will also be announced to incentivize this, he added.  ""We really want people to really test this so we have a user interface, we have an API and we've created an open Github for everything they could find, so if we go hopefully bug-free on the mainnet,"" Karapetsas told CoinDesk.  Seeking to bypass some of the scaling hurdles faced by ethereum and other blockchains, the release date for the implementation is not yet confirmed. However, the Raiden team plans to remain close to its original promise of a summer launch.  ""Until the end of August it's still summer,"" Karapetsas said. ""Feature-wise the plan is to just launch with the same features that have on the testnet right now.""  Going forward, Karapetsas said regular code updates and optimizations will continue following the mainnet release, adding that the software will work in tandem with other scaling technologies toward a more optimized ethereum.  ""Raiden is essentially the payment channel network for ethereum, it's supposed to help us scale token transfers,"" Karapetsas explained, adding:  ""The long term goal would be to have people use Raiden from a mobile device and be able to make off-chain token transfers just from their phone. That would be the long term vision, it would probably work in combination with various scaling solutions, sharding, plasma, a sort of hybrid.""

The report further added that ""blockchain platform software will be the largest category of spending outside of the services category and one of the fastest growing categories overall, along with security software.""  This spending trajectory is largely expected to be led by the financial sector, with banks being early adopters of the technology. The report explains that data shows a total of $552 million was spent on blockchain by the financial sector alone in 2018. The distribution and services sector is not too far behind, having invested a reported $334 million.  Further, the report covers developments in the blockchain industry for eight different regions across the globe with the potential addition of China as a ninth in forthcoming reports.  As the scope of the analysis currently stands, the United States delivers more than 36 percent of worldwide spending on blockchain technology with cross-border payments and settlements being the most popular use case for the technology. A total of $193 million has reportedly been spent on this field.  Looking ahead, Jessica Goepfert, program vice president for the International Data Corporation, said certain use cases for blockchain technology are not going away anytime soon, saying:  ""We continue to see the greatest spending and growth for blockchain around lot lineage and asset and goods management ...

42381061,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93PgH,1532005230,Ethereum's Most Heated Tech Debate Is Proving It's Far From Over,"Ethereum's most polarizing debate is back – and, arguably, as complex as ever.  Largely undiscussed since April, the question of whether the world's second-largest blockchain would consider a system-wide software upgrade as a way to return $239 million lost due to a mishap at a major startup resurfaced with a new round of infighting among stakeholders this week.  Sparked in the days prior to a meeting in Berlin meant to address decision-making challenges on the decentralized network, the issue revolves around a code proposal called ethereum improvement proposal (EIP) 999 and the specific way in which it has been reviewed.  At issue is not just how ethereum developers will handle this contentious code change, but those that may arise in the future as the platform grows and expands.  Still, this week's events began on a smaller scale, with the planned meeting of the Council of Ethereum Magicians, a developer group launched in early 2018 as a forum for discussion on how ethereum should handle technical updates and code disputes.  Following the discussion Saturday, Afri Schoedon, communications manager at Parity Technologies, the startup whose code snafu caused the widely publicized fund freeze, suggested a change to EIP 999 – a proposal that seeks to reactivate the 584 wallets in which much of the lost funds remain.  A relatively minor suggestion, Schoedon asked to advance EIP 999 within the parameters of ethereum's process for code review. Due to what he perceived as a lack of technical objections to the proposal, he inferred it should be set to ""accepted"" status.  But the move had wider repercussions, with sometimes vitriolic debate surfacing on Twitter, Github and Reddit. The reaction was swift, with those against the code even proposing a rival pull request to move the proposal to the ""rejected"" state.  ""I wish people would stop using the EIPs repository for political grandstanding,"" core developer Nick Johnson tweeted.  The move has sparked a heated reaction from those who don't want to see the funds restored out of fear these requests will become too commonplace.  As the rationale goes, if ethereum users and developers are able to act like market managers, how are they different from today's central monetary authorities?  ""The Parity bailout EIP was just stealth 'accepted' by the Ethereum Foundation despite community rejection. Apparently the community found out and now the pull request has been closed,"" one observer tweeted: ""Ethereum is completely centralized.""  Backtracking the code  But if the implications of the move have been lasting, the inciting incident was arguably brief.  Schoedon has since asked for the pull request to be closed, stating that his actions stemmed from a misunderstanding of how others believe the EIP process should be conducted (the subtleties of which are still being debated).  Complicating matters was that Schoedon, who initiated the pull request to move the proposal to ""accepted,"" is also the author of EIP 999.  More broadly, however, the issue appears to have exacerbated the very problems that many ethereum developers have acknowledged for some time – despite attempts to coordinate in person, digital communications hold the potential to vastly polarize users.  On top of this, there are concerns that, on the internet, competing projects could deliberately add fire to the controversy, swarming social media with fake accounts to create the illusion of outrage.  In an effort to ease the impact this could have on core developers tasked with accepting code changes, the controversy has forced developers to consider how to clarity the EIP process, the formal way by which code changes are organized in the ethereum repository.  One user summarized:  ""EIP 999 is a great example of stalled governance and it just won't go away, and it is consuming every discussion to the point of exhaustion.""  Ritual magic  But in response to the uncertainty produced as a result of Schoedon's pull request, efforts to further clarify the EIP acceptance process have been attempted.  Micah Zoltu, a developer from prediction market Augur, submitted a pull request to clarify that the process should ""focus on technicals not community sentiment,"" in order to liberate core developers from becoming trapped in political debates.  The pull request sparked concerns on social media, though, with one Reddit user warning that ""changes are being made to the EIP process which remove the need for gauging community opinion and bypass a core [developer] vote.""  Speaking on a forum, Zoltu explained that he wished to avoid the situation of ""ritual magic or tribal knowledge"" being relied on to produce agreement among developers.  ""What I'm trying to avoid is the situation where the process looks something like: do X, do Y, ritual magic or tribal knowledge, do Z,"" Zoltu said.  Such discussion echoed the Magicians meetup in Berlin, where talk centered on how, to reduce political gridlock, core developers should evaluate proposals purely based on technical merit – a sentiment that informed Schoedon's decision to submit a pull request to move EIP-999 to ""accepted.""  According to attendees, if the EIP review and acceptance process is heralded as purely technical, it can relieve core developers from the role of social adjudicators.  Still, when it comes to proposals like EIP 999, the boundaries between such things are more opaque. As one attendee of the Magicians meetup noted:  ""It is a very clear technical proposal with also profound social implications.""  Initiated as a way to allow a wider group of stakeholders to coordinate on technical changes, the Magicians group has a wider scope than the fund recovery question.  However, because it provides an outlet for more complex discussions, the question of fund recovery has long been associated with the group – which was created in part to address the governance concerns that the recovery debate had revealed.  In the days prior to the meeting, Ryan Zurrer, principle and venture partner at Polychain Capital, published a blog post urging the Magicians specifically to a produce a roadmap for recovery, stating that ethereum's ability to remain adaptive was at stake.  The post led to bickering on social media, with researcher Dean Eigenmann going so far as to warn that the Magicians group was being ""hijacked"" to serve the needs of those who lost funds.  ""You thought we were all done with EIP 999,"" Eigenmann tweeted, ""It will lead nowhere.""  With much at stake, and many affected parties present at the meeting, the question of recovery haunted the event – so much so that Peter Mauric, head of public affairs at Parity Technologies, called it the ""8,000-pound elephant in the room.""  EIP 867  A roadmap for recovery was discussed, but not without recognition of the fact that the Magicians group is an informal body only.  ""There is no finality in the room here,"" Boris Mann, co-organizer of the event, reminded everyone. ""We know that humans meeting face-to-face is a good way to get a job done, but finality in any decisions will be made in a much more open and accessible forum than this discussion.""  As such, Mann posited that rather, the Magicians should be used as a forum to discuss the development of EIPs that are then handed over to the core developer team for review.  In order to assist this process, the Magicians members vowed to coordinate in smaller working groups, or ""rings."" These rings, and the EIPs they produce, will be supported by a signalling website led by Griff Green, that measures a wide group of ethereum stakeholders in an attempt to add legitimacy to changes to the protocol.  Rather than just measuring ether holdings – as is the case with the current signaling tool, Carbon Vote – the new signaling system would try to measure responses from miners, developers and even non-technical stakeholders as well.  ""This is a really, really important topic and, I think, the foundational layer for us to make decisions on ethereum,"" Green said.  In order to simplify the review process for core developers – the body of developers that are tasked with maintaining the ethereum core base – fund recovery proposals would require a process like ethereum improvement proposal EIP 867, that offers a generic framework for recovery proposals.  While fiercely debated at its inception, such a framework would allow anyone who has lost funds on ethereum, not just from the Parity multisig, to apply for fund recovery.  Mann told CoinDesk:  ""I think that people feel unstuck in the sense of, 'Hey, EIP 867 needs to get turned into an actual process.'""  Risks of inaction  That's not to say that progress at the in-person event couldn't help mitigate future issues with controversial code proposals.  Speaking on a forum subsequently, Mann summarized the situation, saying that, once EIP 867 is improved, it could be submitted as an EIP alongside a ""request for signaling.""  ""Signaling gets done, signaling results inform core dev decision, core devs decide whether to schedule into next planned [hard fork],"" Mann continued.  Speaking at the Magicians meeting, other pro-recovery participants suggested that such proposals could conform to a process suggested by Vitalik Buterin in a recent interview, in which the network's founder hinted that developers could initiate a one-time ""clean up"" recovery fork.  ""That said, I do not think it is my place to make that decision or even heavily influence it,"" Buterin said in June.  According to attendees at the meeting, no matter which direction is taken, the decision would need to come with a strict social contract that defines ethereum's attitude to fund recovery far into the future – such that the debate doesn't impinge on ethereum indefinitely.  Still, the question of governance is still far from being solved and remain an issue that is frustrating users on both sides of the debate.  ""I get emails and phone calls on a very regular basis,"" Mauric from Parity told CoinDesk, ""The reality is these are good projects that have committed to building distributed tech. These are builders funds, and its difficult to come back to the people behind these projects and say 'Right, we understand, but we need to figure out governance first.'""  As a result of the stasis, some ethereum developers even urged the Ethereum Foundation to take a stronger leadership position when it comes to the debate.  Zoltu concluded:  ""Choosing to not implement EIP-999 is making a decision. So is choosing to completely ignore it. I'm generally against [the Ethereum Foundation]/Core Devs using the 'bury head in sand' approach to governance. I don't think it is healthy at all. It favors stagnation over moving forward, and eventually leads to calcification.""

42381055,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93PbF,1532001629,Vietnam Inches Closer to Suspending Imports of Cryptocurrency Miners,"Vietnam has moved a step closer to halting cryptocurrency miner imports, a local new source reported on Thursday.  According to Viet Nam News, State Bank of Vietnam (SBV), the country's central bank, has now agreed to a proposed plan to halt imports of the specialized mining devices since the country has already banned the use of cryptocurrency as a payment method.  The decision is a response to a proposal from the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MoIT) last month.  The ministry said at the time that since cryptocurrency miners are currently not on the list of prohibited imports, it has become difficult for local authorities to enforce the current restrictions on cryptocurrencies.  The MoIT proposal also followed a request from the Ministry of Finance in May that argued for a temporary suspension, given a recent crackdown by local authorities' over an alleged $660 million cryptocurrency fraud.  According to a news report from Xinhua last month, Vietnam imported more than 6,300 application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) devices – used to mine cryptocurrencies like bitcoin – in the first four months of 2018. Over the whole of 2017, over 9,300 crypto miners reportedly entered the country.  Most of the imports went to Ho Chi Minh City and the national capital Hanoi, the report added, citing data from the General Department of Vietnam Customs.

42381059,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93PhX,1531998012,Bitcoin Price Prepares to Test $8K After Bull Breather,"Bitcoin's (BTC) minor price pullback yesterday has likely recharged the bulls for a rally towards $8,000, technical charts indicate.  The leading cryptocurrency has spent a better part of the last 15 hours trading in the $7,240–$7,440 range, having clocked a 40-day high of $7,588 at 18:00 UTC yesterday.  Moreover, BTC was looking overbought at multi-week highs, hence a minor correction was expected.  More importantly, the price pullback and the subsequent consolidation, when viewed against the backdrop of the high volume inverse head-and-shoulders breakout, indicate that BTC has likely gathered steam for a more sustainable rally towards $8,000.  At press time, BTC is changing hands at $7,400 on Bitfinex – up 0.2 percent on a 24-hour basis.  Daily chart  While BTC's rally has stalled in the last 24 hours, the bias remains bullish since prices are holding well above the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline support (former resistance) of $6,838.  The relative strength index (RSI) is hovering above 50.00 (in bullish territory).  The 5-day and 10-day moving averages (MAs) are trending north, indicating a bullish setup. The chart also shows a bullish crossover between 5-day and 50-day MAs.  What's more, the Bollinger Bands (standard deviation of +2, -2 on the 20-day MA) are beginning to rise in favor of the bulls and the upper Bolliger Band is offering price support.  Clearly, bitcoin remains on the hunt for $8,000 and the short duration chart indicates the move could happen in the next 48 hours.  Hourly chart  The Bollinger Bands narrowed at 00:00 UTC yesterday, meaning price volatility (as represented by the gap between the Bollinger Bands) has remained low for more than 24 hours.  As a result, we could in for a big move in either direction as an extended period of low volatility is often followed by a period of high volatility.  That said, the big move will likely happen on the higher side as the RSI is beginning to rise, after having built a base around 46.00 in the last 15 hours.  Meanwhile, the major moving averages (50-hour, 100-hour and 200-hour) have caught up with rising prices, which indicates BTC markets are no longer overstretched. The averages are located one below the other, indicating the path of least resistance is to the upside.  View  Bitcoin's price pullback last night has likely recharged the engines for a rally to $8,000 and the psychological resistance could be put to test in the next 48 hours.  The short-term outlook remains bullish as long as BTC is trading above the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline of $6,838.  A deeper technical correction, if it occurs, could be short-lived as the daily chart and the hourly chart are biased towards the bulls.

According to a local news report on Thursday, the blockchain trial will initially allow the auditing firms to conduct so-called external confirmation – the process of obtaining and evaluating audit evidence – for a group of selected companies that are publicly traded on the island.  Traditionally, external confirmation is conducted manually by auditing firms to verify the authenticity of public companies' financial transactions with third parties.  Developed by Taiwan's Financial Information Service Co. (FISC) together with the 20 banks, the new platform moves the public firms' transaction data onto a blockchain, where the banks participate as validators.  The goal is to allow auditing firms to view the transactions through a traceable and tamper-proof chain of data in distributed manner, streamlining and automating the confirmation process. FISC expects the new technology to reduce the confirmation time from typically ""half a month"" to ""within a day.""  Initially founded by the island's Ministry of Finance as its information technology arm, FISC was later incorporated as a company with both private and public capital.  The firm announced its move into blockchain in January 2017, together with the 20 major banks, as part of a wider effort to revamp financial technologies in Taiwan. The firm said in the report that, following the trial, it expects to roll out the auditing service to the 1,400 public companies listed on the island next year.

42381045,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93PNP,1531980055,Government-Backed Blockchain Trade Platform Launches in Singapore,"CrimsonLogic, a Singapore-based e-government service provider owned by a government agency and a major port operator, has announced the launch of a blockchain platform focused on cross-border trade.  The firm's fully-owned subsidiary GeTS launched the service on Wednesday, according to a press release. Dubbed GeTS Open Trade Blockchain, the platform is a permissioned network that is run and validated by accredited trade compliance firms acting as nodes.  On top of the open infrastructure, companies in the cross-border supply chain industry can develop decentralized applications for specific needs. The goal is to enable different parties, such as ports, shipping companies and customers, to view and transact trade-related documents in a distributed way to improve supply chain efficiency and transparency.  Eugene Wong, chairman of CrimsonLogic and GeTS, said in the announcement:  ""We believe that our blockchain technology can help create greater trust amongst cross-border traders in ASEAN and along China's Belt Road Initiative and Southern Transport Corridor. Trade volume between ASEAN and China would become the single largest transaction between two regions and we hope to facilitate this.""  Currently, CrimsonLogic's biggest shareholder (with 55 percent ownership) is IE Singapore, a government agency under the Ministry of Trade and Industry, which fosters the growth of Singaporean businesses overseas.  In February, PSA International, which operates ports in South America, Southeast Asia and Europe, became the other major stakeholder of CrimsonLogic through an acquisition of the remaining 45 percent of the firm.  The blockchain effort follows a pilot program conducted by PSA and IBM last year that tested a proof-of-concept aimed to automate trade document transactions via a distributed network for supply chain partners.  Earlier this year, the companies claimed the proof-of-concept successfully tracked and transacted trade information during a cross-border shipment from China's Chongqing city to Singapore.

42401638,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd1yKV,1531974635,"These Digital Monsters Live on Ethereum, But They'll Fight on Zilliqa","Before my one and only ""mon"" reached level 4, I was out of ether.  Such was the end result of my first experience with Etheremon, a game inspired by Pokemon and built on the world's second-largest blockchain, ethereum. I had around $15 worth of ether to spare, so I decided to try it out, eventually arming myself with a cute, fire-themed creature called Kyari.  But I quickly ran into an issue with the blockchain game. Namely, with $15, I never got a chance to move on to more interesting gameplay: battling other users' mons, ""evolving"" my mon into more powerful forms, laying eggs or making trades.  Every action, from ""catching"" the mon (in reality a non-fungible ERC-721 token) to ""training"" it in gym sessions with other mons (i.e., altering the data associated with that token), had cost the equivalent of a dollar or two.  The reason is that every update to Etheremon's smart contracts calls for ""gas,"" part of a complex fee mechanism that incentivizes the miners who maintain the ethereum blockchain. Making matters worse, these transactions often took several minutes to complete.  Such problems – transactions that cost too much and take too long – are known by the shorthand ""scalability"" in the blockchain world, and they've caused severe headaches for game designers who want to use a decentralized platform like ethereum.  Poor user experience – which also involves having to buy ether and install a browser extension that can connect to the blockchain – has stunted adoption. Etheremon is the second-most popular ethereum-based game, but that's not saying much. At the time of writing, it's had just 209 users over the previous 24 hours, according to DappRadar.  At one point, gas costs rose so much that Etheremon's developers had to take drastic action.  ""It became super, super expensive, and we saw our daily active users drop a lot,"" co-founder and business development director Nedrick Ngo told CoinDesk.  As a result, the team moved ""battles"" – in which users pit their mons against others' for experience points and bragging rights – off the ethereum chain and onto centralized servers.  Partially re-centralizing a decentralized game seems like it's missing the point, however, so Etheremon announced earlier this month that it is planning to move much of the gameplay to a new, soon-to-be-launched blockchain protocol called Zilliqa (both Zilliqa's and Etheremon's teams are based in Singapore).  But in a decision that may reflect an emerging trend in the development of decentralized applications (dapps) such as Etheremon, the designers don't plan to move the game's assets. The tokenized ""mons"" that encode data such as level, experience points and evolutionary form – data that gamers have earned through many slow and costly actions – will stay on ethereum for the time being.  In other words, Etheremon will be one game on two blockchains: a zippier, more scalable chain on top, allowing users to play the game quickly and cheaply; and an (arguably) more secure chain below, providing users with the reassurance that their hard-won assets are safe from attack.  As Ngo put it:  ""Zilliqa would work as a side-chain for us.""  Zilliqa: sharding from launch  Ethereum's developers have a number of scalability projects in the works. But according to Ngo, Etheremon's team and its users can't wait around for those to be implemented.  ""They have to commit Casper and then proof-of-stake and then sharding, so it will take a long time,"" he told CoinDesk.  Zilliqa, by contrast, is rare if not unique in the world of blockchain protocols, in that it is integrating sharding, a technique that's been used to manage more traditional databases for decades, from the get-go.  Amrit Kumar, Zilliqa's co-founder and head of research, said the technique has allowed the network to process 2,488 transactions per second in tests, whereas ethereum, right now, can manage perhaps a couple dozen.  Kumar explained how sharding works in a blockchain network using an example.  Given a network of 10,000 computers (known as ""nodes""), he said, a sharding protocol would split those up into 10 smaller networks (or ""shards"") of 1,000 nodes each. Each shard would then process a subset of the total transactions. Every time Alice sent some cryptocurrency tokens, for example, shard A would process the transaction. Every time Bob sent some, the transaction would go to shard B.  This technique is relatively new territory for blockchains, but Zilliqa's team brings serious academic credentials to bear on the problem.  Two authors of an early paper laying out a blockchain sharding protocol are involved: Zilliqa chief scientific advisor Prateek Saxena, and Kyber Network CEO Loi Luu, who advises the project.  Kumar said Zilliqa, which is expected to launch before the end of the third quarter, aims to be ""the go-to platform for applications which require high throughput and high scalability.""  Bedrock ethereum  Scalability and throughput are not the only considerations for Etheremon's developers, however.  Users want gameplay to be fast, but they want to be sure there's no risk of losing their lovingly bred, trained and evolved monsters. The mons represent a good deal of accumulated time and expense for some users, and therefore there are currently no plans to migrate these tokens over to a new chain.  Instead, the data from gameplay on Zilliqa will periodically be synced over to these tokens.  ""We actually feel that keeping all the in-game assets on the ethereum network is very secure,"" said Ngo.  Kumar said he understood why Etheremon would keep in-game assets where they were:  ""Ethereum is certainly an established network and we do understand that there's still some benefit of using ethereum.""  He argued, however, that in certain ways Zilliqa offers more security than ethereum, because Zilliqa's non-Turing complete language, Scilla, means ""you won't be able to write a buggy contract like [the] DAO,"" the ethereum-based victim of an infamous 2016 hack. According to Kumar, because Scilla is not as complex as ethereum's language, Solidity, it is easier to test for vulnerabilities.  On the other hand, Zilliqa's method of reaching network consensus, practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT), is potentially more vulnerable to certain kinds of attacks than ethereum's proof-of-work method. Unlike bitcoin or ethereum, which are theoretically secure so long as the majority of the nodes follows the rules, PBFT presents a potential limitation, in that it requires two-thirds of nodes to be ""honest.""  In other words, PBFT runs the risk not just of 51 percent attacks, but 34 percent attacks. Although, Kumar argued that the situation is actually more complicated, since it's possible to attack a proof-of-work blockchain without controlling a majority of nodes.  Whatever the actual security advantages of keeping Etheremon assets on ethereum versus moving them to Zilliqa, this sort of architecture – in which a slower, battle-tested chain is used to store assets while a top layer processes transactions – may be catching on.  Loom Network offers tools to build dedicated sidechains for decentralized games that are anchored to ethereum, and has begun exploring shared sidechains that host multiple games.  ""It's really important to have that decentralized base layer of ethereum,"" Loom Network co-founder James Duffy told CoinDesk in May, ""because then you can use it like the high court.""  At the moment, Etheremon and Zilliqa have yet to figure out how exactly to juggle two chains, but Ngo was optimistic, telling CoinDesk this is ""just the first stage of the collaboration.""

""The first markets have successfully resolved,"" the project tweeted Wednesday. Payments of ether worth around $20,000 are now going out to the first brave crop of users, who used the betting platform without knowing for sure whether it would work as advertised.  The handful of early markets ""seem to have resolved fine,"" Augur co-founder Joey Krug told CoinDesk. ""A few [user interface] bugs I saw but nothing major.""  Augur is a peer-to-peer platform where anyone can pose any question for anyone else to bet money on, such as the result of an election or the price of an asset on a given date.  It went live on ethereum last week, nearly three years after the initial coin offering (ICO) that funded its development concluded. Two of those years were spent in rigorous beta testing, which – so far – appear to have paid off, since the application has experienced only minor hiccups.  Only a couple of the markets that have now settled had any money staked on their outcomes. The most valuable market was for the outcome of the France-Belgium World Cup semifinal game. (France won).  More than one user in a community forum expressed relief and congratulated the Augur team on Wednesday.  One of these, Kitsana Dounglomchan, confirmed that he'd received the ether fees he was owed – users earn these fees for creating or reporting the outcome of a prediction market – as well as the ""reputation"" or REP tokens he'd staked. If users report an incorrect outcome, they risk losing their REP tokens, so there's an incentive to tell the truth.  ""Hats off to the entire Augur team,"" Dounglomchan wrote.  Just getting started  The first round of market settlements on Augur was relatively small, Krug said, because ""it was basically only markets where the event actually happened in the first 17 hours or so after launch.""  Krug estimated that just over $20,000 worth of ether had been paid out, based on data from Predictions.Global, a site that displays Augur betting markets. He did not include the value of REP token stakes.  The amount of money staked on Augur prediction markets has ballooned in recent days. Predictions.Global shows 1,963 ether in total ""open interest,"" worth nearly $1 million at the time of writing. That figure has nearly tripled since Monday.  For that reason, Krug believes the next round of settlements will far exceed this week's total. He told CoinDesk:  ""Next week should be bigger.""

42401639,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd1yLU,1531958410,Pop Icon Peter Gabriel Has Invested in a Blockchain Startup,"Legendary musician Peter Gabriel is backing UK-based blockchain startup Provenance, though the full amount of Gabriel's investment has yet to be disclosed.  Gabriel, formerly the lead singer of rock band Genesis, invested in Provenance along with Working Capital Fund, Digital Currency Group, Merian Ventures and Plug and Play, according to a news release. The funding round comes months after the startup raised $800,000 in seed funding in 2017, as previously reported.  Provenance's blockchain is aimed at creating transparency in food transportation, a problem it has been looking into since the firm was first established in 2013. The company plans to use its funding to establish a blockchain-powered supply chain platform with more than 1,000 clients by 2025, according to the release.  In a statement, Gabriel endorsed the startup, saying he believes the funding will be put to good use.  He added:  ""We need to be able to trust the source and distribution chain, particularly when it comes to guaranteeing that things are produced ethically and in an ecologically sound way. I am convinced that the service Provenance provides, using their blockchain data system, is going to find a big role going forward and will be of great use to the consumer and provide a level playing field for smaller, independent producers on which to compete with the big players.""  Prior to Provenance, the Genesis frontman has invested in a number of other startups, including Ctrlio, a marketing startup that helps price comparison websites create customized promotions. However, this appears to be his first investment in a blockchain-focused company.  Moreover, Provenance announced new members to its board of directors. Alexsis de Raadt-St. James, founder and managing partner of Merian Ventures, will join the company as chairperson of the Board of Directors, while Working Capital partner Chemain Sanan will join as a director.
