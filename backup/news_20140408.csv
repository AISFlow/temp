42397528,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbAoj9,1396993948,"Inside Bitcoins NYC Day 2 Showcases a Maturing, Legitimate Industry","The second and final day of the Inside Bitcoins NYC conference took place on 8th April at the Javits Center in Manhattan, and built further on themes discussed in the conference's informative first day.  Although the topics that were discussed ranged from decentralized autonomous corporations (DACs) to merchant adoption of digital currencies, the conversation frequently returned to the issue of regulation, and a particular focus was given to Wall Street’s involvement with bitcoin through institutional investments.  Wall Street debates the fair value of bitcoin  The opening keynote for the day featured a panel of speakers who work on Wall Street. Panelists such as SecondMarket Founder and CEO Barry Silbert and Wedbush Securities’ Managing Director Gil Luria provided insight on how bitcoin is viewed by the big players in New York’s financial district.  ""@Wedbush has decided to embrace bitcoin [...] and we plan to continue being involved."" - @gilluria at bitcoinconf — CoinDesk (@coindesk) April 8, 2014  Throughout the morning, Bloomberg's World Stock Index was cited as an influencing factor regarding institutions on Wall Street ultimately investing in bitcoin.  Dan Morehead, CEO of Pantera Capitalhttps://panteracapital.com/about/, weighed in on the subject during a panel entitled 'Birth of a New Asset Class: The Institutional Investor View on Bitcoin':  ""The reality is that there's a lot of people on Wall Street who won't trade in something that's not on Bloomberg. It may be arbitrary, but it's the truth.""  This stance seemed to be echoed by panel members during the opening keynote. Luria also referenced Bloomberg's stock index and shared some news that received an audibly warm response from the room:  ""I called my Bloomberg rep to ask when they'd start quoting bitcoin. The answer was soon."" - @gilluria of @Wedbush#bitcoinconf — CoinDesk (@coindesk) April 8, 2014  After telling the audience that in the world of Wall Street, ""if it's on Bloomberg, then it's real"", Luria continued to postulate the fair market value of bitcoin, concluding with a prediction that received a mixed response from panelists and attendees.  Said Luria:  ""I think that if a lot things happen right, the price could reach $500,000 to $1m per bitcoin.""  Among the factors that need to ""happen right"" for this valuation to be realized was, of course, regulation.  The topic of governmental regulation pervaded the discussion about Wall Street's involvement with bitcoin, and even became the primary focus of a seemingly less-related panel titled 'Creating and Funding the Next 100 Great Bitcoin Companies'.  Regulation steals the show  While there was a vocal minority of attendees in opposition of the regulation of digital currencies, it was evident that most people in attendance have warmed up to the notion that some level of governmental regulation is inevitable for bitcoin to be sustainable in the long term.  Texas Congressman Steve Stockman took the microphone and was immediately met with applause from the room.  Rep. Stockman surprised the crowd with an announcement regarding the IRS' recent classification of bitcoin as property, which was a hotly debated topic throughout the conference:  BREAKING: Texas Congressman Steve Stockman will introduce a bill that will ""take bitcoin out of the IRS' hands, reclassify it as currency"" — CoinDesk (@coindesk) April 8, 2014  Rep. Stockman continued to say that he values the feedback of the bitcoin community, and reassured the crowded room that his office works to serve the public – including the bitcoin community – and not the other way around.  'Learning curve' for regulators  One of the more poignant talks of the day was delivered by John G. Collins, who serves as a professional staff member on the US Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.  Collins works as an advisor to US Senator Tom Carper, and opened his lecture with a refreshing level of transparency, telling attendees that he hopes to learn more from the bitcoin community so that ""when [members of Congress] do make decisions, they're thoughtful and informed.""  [post-quote]  Referring to the technical and financial complexities that underlie bitcoin and other digital currencies, Collins admitted that public policy in the US can often move at a slow pace, and said that it's natural for there ""to be a learning curve in the government, and for there to be a lot of questions"".  Collins explained the fundamental challenge that the US government faces in dealing with bitcoin: the government is concerned about consumer protection and doesn't want to ""chase [their] tails on the law enforcement side"", but regulators also want to avoid stifling innovation and driving jobs and capital overseas.  An emphasis was placed on fostering collaboration between the bitcoin community and regulators. Collins conceded that ""regulators only know as much as [the community is] willing to educate them about"", but asserted that the bitcoin community needs to acknowledge the political, legal and consumer protection issues that cause concern for regulators.  Moving forward  The general tolerance of regulation among attendees of Inside Bitcoins NYC signals what many consider to be the next phase in bitcoin's penetration into mainstream adoption.  With institutional investors from Wall Street showing interest in bitcoin – a higher calibre of entrepreneurs entering the scene and a general warming up to regulators – Inside Bitcoins NYC made it clear that the digital currency industry is quickly maturing, and as such, it demands to be taken seriously.

42397525,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbAol7,1396989762,Charlie Lee Proposes Merged Mining of Litecoin and Dogecoin,"The surprising success of dogecoin has changed the way that miners view the scrypt algorithm. And that's not good for litecoin or doge, according to Charlie Lee.  On the dogecoin subreddit, the litecoin creator has proposed merged mining of the coins in order to ensure better security:  ""Litecoin's security is a lot less than it could be. So merging mining with dogecoin would make both litecoin/dogecoin almost impossible to 51%.""  What does '51%' mean?  When Lee refers to this 51%, he's talking about a '51% attack', an exploit that could be made possible if a miner or a pool could take control of over half of a cryptocurrency's network power.  Bitcoin Foundation Chief Scientist Gavin Andresen has a brief post on his blog outlining what such an attack entails.  Essentially, it means that block transactions could end up being controlled without the consensus users expect from these networks today.  Mining is an important distributed method for confirming transactions, but it ultimately costs money to do so in equipment, electricity and time.  So, the reality is that scrypt miners point their mining rigs to the coin that they think has the highest potential for profit.  As miners have become interested in dogecoin at the expense of litecoin, this has meant that there is less hashing power growth in LTC. However, at 174,000 total MH/s for LTC versus 71,000MH/s for doge, litecoin is still a much more powerful network.  Merged mining  In the past, dogecoin had been retargeting only every four hours. This meant opportunistic miners could move to other scrypt-based coins and cause difficulty to be misrepresented as a test of that network's hashing power.  In order to prevent this, the difficulty retargeting now happens during doge's block generation, which is roughly every minute. This has helped to better secure dogecoin's hashing power and made it less volatile.  The idea of merged mining two independently successful coins is a colorful concept.  ""Merge mining only affects mining and nothing else,"" Lee says in his post. In addition, he tries to allay the fears that litecoin and dogecoin could become tangled with one another rather confusingly – a problem that could affect the technical and mainstream communities around both.  Says Lee:  ""[It] doesn't merge the blockchains, the clients, economics of the coins, the dev team, or the communities. All it does is make it so that you mine both coins at the same time, and secure both coins at the same time.""  Hard fork  Lee's idea is to 'hard fork' dogecoin in order to allow for merged mining.  At least one of the coins would need to do so for the idea to work. And the ideal coin to fork is dogecoin, according to Lee:  ""This [merged mining] can be accomplished by a hard fork in either coin. You've likely seen my take on why hard forking litecoin is too dangerous today. Not so for dogecoin.""  Dogecoin was hard forked in March, as users were required to update to the 1.6 version of the client that added features such as a four-hour maturing period for mined coins.  Jackson Palmer  , one of the co-founders of dogecoin, believes that litecoin's size could make a fork quite difficult:  ""As for the fork, they have a larger market cap and hash rate, and are hence more scared about getting 51% of their users to update to a new version.""  Speculative assets  Cryptocurrencies exist in a unique predicament, as most aren't used for anything other than speculation. Litecoin is accepted by some merchants, including those using GoCoin, a payment processor. But dogecoin's success has been because of microtransactions on reddit, not because of merchant acceptance, mining or trading for profit.  It is fundamentally a transactional currency for tipping on reddit, something Palmer ideally wants to continue focusing on:  ""Essentially, I don’t think merged mining is the answer for dogecoin right now. It’s less than five months old and to say that anything needs to be done right now comes down to pure speculation.""  Would merged mining help to maintain both litecoin and dogecoin? Probably, but the two currencies are in such different stages that it might be better to let each thrive in its own way.  Added Palmer:  ""Brashly changing [proof-of-work] algorithms, merged mining and all other solutions I’ve been presented with are simply band-aids to the fact that a currency requires active use and demand to succeed.""

42397516,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbAoVN,1396987495,US Congressman to Submit Bitcoin Tax Bill,"US Congressman Steve Stockman of Texas is preparing to introduce a new bill, the 'Virtual Currency Tax Reform Act', which, if passed, would tax bitcoins as currency instead of property.  Currently, the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) views bitcoin and other digital currencies as property. When someone sells their bitcoin or makes a purchase in bitcoin, they are subject to a 15% capital gains tax. Any wages paid out in digital currencies must also be reported to federal tax authorities.  (Readers can learn more about the IRS decision here.)  Stockman's proposal recognizes bitcoin and other digital currencies as legal tender. Instead of triggering capital gains taxes for each transaction, purchases made with bitcoins would require sales taxes instead.  In a brief statement, Stockman said that policies regarding bitcoin should be aimed at spurring innovation, rather than imposing restrictive levies:  “This is a nascent industry. Along with 3D printers and nanotubes, cryptocurrency is the future. We need to encourage it, not discourage it. There is risk associated with every budding industry in America.”  When reached for comment, Stockman's office said that more information regarding the bill is forthcoming, and that a public version has not yet been released.  According to an official press release, Stockman is expected to comment on the bill during an 8th April meeting at the New York City Bitcoin Center.  Earlier this year, Stockman made headlines by accepting bitcoin-denominated campaign donations in his race for US Senate.  US Congressional interest in bitcoin grows  Stockman's legislation would constitute one of the first major efforts by Congress to regulate bitcoin usage in the United States. Since late last year, Congress has shown an increasing level of interest in the oversight and regulation of digital currencies.  Earlier this month, the US House of Representatives Committee On Small Business held a hearing which included testimony from George Mason University's Jerry Brito and market expert Mark T. Williams.  On a less serious note, Colorado Congressman Jared Polis responded to calls to ban bitcoin with his own proposal to ban the US dollar.

42397522,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbAofD,1396979476,US Attorney General Eric Holder Keeping an Eye on Bitcoin,"US Attorney General Eric Holder believes bitcoin criminals pose a new set of challenges for law enforcement. During his testimony this morning before the House Judiciary Committee Holder said the US Justice Department is keeping track of bitcoin-related developments.  Of course, this does not mean that the Justice Department is treating all bitcoin transactions as suspect. Holder stressed that the department is working with financial regulators in an effort to weed out the bad apples.  Bitcoin can pose challenges for law enforcement  Holder’s interest in bitcoin is focused solely on “bad apples” and cyber criminals who are taking advantage of bitcoin’s pseudo anonymity.  He said the Justice Department is committed to innovating alongside bitcoin in order to ensure criminal investigations are not impeded by technological advances. This is nothing new in the world of cyber crime. Authorities have been engaged in a technological arms race with cyber criminals for decades.    Holder told the House Committee:    “As virtual currency systems develop, it will be imperative to law enforcement interests that those systems comply with applicable anti-money laundering statutes and know-your-customer controls.”  Holder issues stern warning  Holder warned that digital currencies wouldn't stay safe havens for cyber criminals, drug traffickers and other bad actors and said that the difficulty of tracking digital currency transactions wouldn't protect them forever.  Said Holder:  “Those who favour virtual currencies solely for their ability to help mask drug trafficking or other illicit conduct should think twice.”  Criminals are looking beyond anonymity  While it is encouraging to see the Justice Department pledging to keep up with technological developments and undermine criminal activities that could benefit from cyptocurrency transactions, Holder did not mention other forms of crime associated with bitcoin and other digital currencies.  Such crimes range from attacks aimed at bitcoin exchanges to hacked wallets and mining malware. The temptation of using a pseudonymous payments system is proving too much for many cyber criminals out there.  Bitcoin ransomware  is on the rise, along with malware that targets bitcoin wallets and even elaborate mining botnets.

42397513,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbAoXL,1396978198,"Brazil to Tax Bitcoin Investors, Not Everyday Users","The Receita Federal, Brazil's tax authority, has established how it will treat the holding and usage of bitcoin and other digital currencies.  The news, first reported by Valor and Folha de S. Paulo, confirms that the Brazilian government does not view bitcoin as a currency.  The Receita Federal is taking a stance similar to the one announced by the US Internal Revenue Service last month. However, there are some key differences that sets Brazil's stance toward digital currencies apart from those of other governments.  Tax limit  Like the United States, Brazil is treating digital currencies as financial assets, with the Receita Federal imposing a 15% capital gains tax at the time of sale.  However, those who sell less coins with a value of less than 35,000 reals (R$), which is almost $16,000, will not have to pay the tax. This means that bitcoin users in Brazil won't have to calculate capital gains taxes when making small consumer purchases.  The Receita Federal is also requiring annual account declarations from those who possess more than R$1,000 in digital currency holdings.  The rules outlined by the tax authority fit within the current framework established by Brazilian law. Furthermore, the government has said that it does not foresee a need to craft regulations geared specifically toward digital currencies.  Positive reaction  Brazilian small business owner and bitcoin supporter José Benchimol saw the news in a positive light, saying that the tax treatment will not impede consumers from adopting digital currencies as a method of payment.  ""Considering the circumstances and comparing this decision to other countries' decisions, I consider it good news. Most consumers and investors will not hit the R$35000 in transactions, which tend facilitate its use as a currency and investment tool. For the bigger investors, the government will charge a tax rate of 15% on capital gains, which is in line with capital gains from major investments in the county – stocks, bonds, real estate and so on.""  BitWifi co-founder Bernardo Quintão remarked to CoinDesk that, in spite of the government's declaration that bitcoin is not a currency, the tax guidance represents forward progress:  ""Personally, for the Brazilian pattern of dealing with novel technology, I think it is a positive approach indeed. It will be a long way before cryptocurrencies are accepted as currency here and this is a good first step.""  Taxation trend  Other governments worldwide have begun establishing their tax guidance policies regarding bitcoin in recent weeks. Earlier this month, Bulgaria's National Revenue Agency declared that bitcoin sales would trigger a 10% income tax.  In late March, Denmark announced that owing to the ""private"" nature of bitcoin trading, taxes would not be imposed. Additionally, the Danish National Tax Assessment Board declared that losses on bitcoin holdings are not tax-deductible.

42397524,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbAok8,1396975718,Survey: People Who Know Least About Bitcoin Want to Ban It Most,"The less people know about bitcoin, the more they want to ban it. That’s according to a Reason-Rupe survey, which found that 56% of those in the survey knew “nothing at all” about bitcoin.  With only 19% claiming to know “a lot” or “some” about bitcoin, the results demonstrate just how little general understanding there is about bitcoin, despite the increase in media coverage.  A Bloomberg poll in December 2013 found 46% of people didn’t know what bitcoin is, with 6% guessing it is an Xbox game. A UK survey in February found a similar figure for awareness of the digital currency.    Age concerns    Of the 1,000 Americans surveyed, those who admitted knowing “nothing at all” about bitcoin were more likely to want to ban it than those who said they had some or a lot of knowledge about it.  After being told that bitcoin is “a new online digital currency that is not connected to any particular country’s currency system and is not controlled by any government”, 54% of Americans who had previously known nothing at all about bitcoin said that their government shouldn’t allow it to be used to purchase goods and services.  Said Reason-Rupe's Director of Polling Emily Ekins:  ""Some people, when they don't know what something is, want to ban it. Other people, if they don't know what something is, they think it should be allowed unless it's causing someone harm in some way. And this question really delineates who those individuals are that favour choice and favour prohibition.""  Age seems to be a factor too: older Americans were more likely to be opposed to bitcoin than young Americans. Only 22% of respondents over the age of 65 were OK with other people using bitcoin. Among 18-24 year olds, 59% said it should be allowed.  The results match up with a previous survey by Harris Interactive, which found a similar reduction in support among older people, and another survey by GfK, which found that 57% of 18-25 year olds thought bitcoin benefits the global economy.    Young and independent    Generally, bitcoin supporters were likely to be young and politically independent, with people identifying as Democrats or Republicans less likely to say that bitcoin should be permitted than people identifying as independent.  “This is part of a larger trend we’re observing with this generation: socially liberal with undecided economic views, but cares deeply about personalization and individual autonomy,” said Ekins.  As might be expected, a majority of people identified by Reason-Rupe as libertarians supported the use of bitcoin.  Surprisingly, though, 39% of libertarians said they would not allow the use of bitcoin – a result that may arise from the fact that Reason-Rupe grouped people under political labels based on questions about the “appropriate scope and power of government,” instead of asking people to self-identify, which may have included people who don’t necessarily consider themselves libertarian.  The survey also found that people who identified as gamers were more likely to support bitcoin. Good for you, gaming community.

42374509,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvlCWL,1396973904,Bitcoin's Carbon Emissions: It's All Relative,"In this, the second of a three-part series, Danny Bradbury explores the impact the bitcoin network is having on the environment. Part One uncovered exactly how many pounds of carbon each bitcoin produces. Here, this figure is compared to the broader financial sector.  📷  Yesterday, we explored how much carbon the average fossil fuel-using miner emits when they produced a bitcoin. 16 gallons of gasoline sounds a lot, but in the broader context, just how bad is it, and how can we frame that argument?  As some people pointed out in the comments, it's all relative.  Bitcoin advocates are quick to defend the high carbon output from mining bitcoin. For one thing, it can only be 'high' if it's compared to something else, points out Bitcoin Foundation chief scientist Gavin Andresen, who this week stepped down as lead developer on bitcoin. ""High compared to what?"" he asks.  Another core developer, Jeff Garzik, says that a proper comparison would at a minimum determine the carbon cost of securing the US dollar, including ""all those data centers and secret service agents and high-technology, anti-counterfeiting printers,"" he points out.  The US Treasury  The closest entity we can think of that manages those things is the US Treasury, which calls itself ""the steward of US economic and financial systems"". According to the EPA, the US Treasury uses 60,454,100 kilowatt hours (kW·h) of green power each year (that is, the equivalent of 60,454,100 kilowatts of power, running for an hour). That represents 18% of its energy usage, which means that it uses 335,520,255 kW·h of energy each year.  Yesterday, institutional bitcoin miner Dave Carlson said that it takes 240 kW·h of energy to produce a bitcoin. So if we divide that into the US Treasury's fossil fuel-based energy usage, that gives us 1,398,000 bitcoins. The bitcoin network spits out 150 coins an hour on average. So if we took the annual fossil fuel used by the US treasury in a year, it would produce bitcoins at the current difficulty for around 9,320 hours, or 388 days.  [post-quote]  In other words, if we took the entire US treasury's (self-)reported carbon emissions, they would keep the bitcoin network running for just over a year.  But the US Treasury isn't the entire financial system. ""On top of that, add the carbon footprint/cost of all the data centers involved in running a US dollar payment network,"" says Garzik.  ""And what about all the other stuff?"" asks Andresen. ""Using coins?"" he says. ""Printing paper money? Using a credit card and getting mailed a statement and sending in a paper check every month? Traditional electronic banking?"" And so on. There are many ways to ask that question. Like this one:  — Ken Tindell (@kentindell) April 7, 2014  The carbon footprint of a single credit card  Before you even get to what's involved in processing a transaction made with your credit card, even the physical plastic has a carbon footprint. The production and transport of the plastic alone in that card could account for between 20g and 50g of carbon emissions, said a 2009 report from sustainability consulting firm TruCert.  20 grams of carbon output per credit card may not seem like a lot, but there were 14.4bn of them in circulation globally in 2012. At the lowest estimate, then, there are 317,466 tons of carbon emissions tied up purely in the manufacture and delivery of all the credit cards out there, which is enough to make just over two million bitcoins, according to our figures from yesterday.  The carbon footprint of a single bank  Extrapolating out to broader financial institutions, we can see large carbon emissions from the banking sector. Just one single bank, HSBC, emitted 963,000 tons of CO2 in 2012, according to its 2012 corporate sustainability report.  That reporting focused purely on the energy usage and business travel, for a single bank. One problem with measuring the footprint of an entire financial system is that there are so many constituent parts to it, which is perhaps why not much seems to have been written about it. In a 2008 report analysing the carbon footprint of banking products, French social and environmental business thinktank Utopies pointed out that there are different categories of carbon emission.  Many companies analyse their own direct emissions. These are the emissions produced by their own factories (where applicable), boilers, and so on. They might if they're enlightened, take into account the indirect emissions, from the electricity that they purchase.  But there are also induced emissions, including everything from the employees' trips to work, through to the energy used to produce the ATMs that the bank uses, and even the carbon emissions made by the companies they invest their customers' money in. Utopies believes that induced emissions could drive up a bank's carbon footprint by a factor of 1,000. Should we include those in the study?  The carbon footprint of the broader financial system  What about more broadly speaking, for the whole financial sector? Carnegie Mellon's Economic Input-Output Life Cycle Assessment model (EIO-LCA) offers an analysis of the carbon produced by various sectors in finance, one of which - ""Nondepository credit intermediation and related activities"" - seems most related to banking.  According to that model, every $1m in activity contributes 14.2 metric tons (which are around 10% heavier than the short tons used by other sources in this article). Studies suggest that the size of the banking sector relative to GDP differs from country to country, but a good overall average for the contribution of the overall financial system to GDP is around 5%, according to this study.  The bottom line is that rising difficulty rates are pushing up bitcoin's environmental impact, and we have a pretty good shot at estimating that impact, because the bounds of the argument are relatively well defined.  The bounds for assessing the environmental impact of the fiat banking and payment system are less well defined, because they include many different physical aspects of maintaining those institutions and their assets. But working with the figures we have, we know that they outclass the bitcoin network manyfold.  So, is bitcoin is worth the carbon emissions it is producing? That's a judgement each person will make individually. One factor that might affect that judgement is whether bitcoin is really likely to replace or mitigate the operation of the current conventional banking system.  But in the meantime, there is another discussion to be had: tomorrow, in the third and final article in the series, we will look at potential ways to mitigate the problem of bitcoin's rising environmental impact.

42397507,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbAoTP,1396973291,Butterfly Labs Faces Class Action Suit Over Pre-Pay Orders,"Bitcoin miner maker Butterfly Labs (BFL) is facing a class action suit, brought by customers from across the US.  The class action was filed through Wood Law Firm LLC by a group of BFL customers challenging the sales and advertising practices of the Kansas-based mining outfit.  Customers claim they ordered and paid BFL mining gear which they never received, or which they received long after BFL's promised shipping date.  Not the first time for Butterfly Labs  Disputes are quite common in the world of mining hardware. Manufacturers are often keen to accept as many pre-orders as possible, often months ahead of the actual shipping date. The money is then used to complete development and manufacture the mining rigs.  Designing ASICs is a tedious process and from the design to tape-out and production, it usually takes on the order of several months – and that’s provided that everything goes according to plan.  In the world of silicon mistakes happen quite often. If the tape-out goes wrong, new chip designs need to be re-spun and put through the same process again. This often happens to big chipmakers, let alone small ASIC designers.  Even a minor glitch can result in a huge setback and due to the nature of bitcoin mining, and a short delay can result in a lot of lost revenue. BFL was forced to delay its 28nm Monarch mining ASIC last month. This was the last straw for many customers, as the ill-fated Monarch was delayed several times since it was announced in August 2013.  The second problem is not of a technical nature. Many companies accept bitcoin payments, which can prove quite risky in the long run. Price swings are just part of the story, as many consumer protection regulations simply do not apply to bitcoin purchases.  This already led to one lawsuit against BFL earlier this year. The company was sued by Martin Meissner, who ordered a couple of miners for $62,000 in March 2013. The order was delayed and there appears to have been a lot of miscommunication between BFL and Meissner, who eventually decided to get a lawyer and sue the company for damages.  Meissner sued BFL  for $5m worth of lost revenue, but the company insists the claim is “highly speculative.”  Class action alleges BFL mined for bitcoins  Meissner was not alone. The new complaint, filed before the United States District Court for the District of Kansas, is seeking to recover pre-payments made to Butterfly Labs and the losses incurred by the customers due to the company’s conduct.  The lawsuit alleges Butterfly Labs required customers to pre-pay for orders of ASIC-based bitcoin mining hardware, and used portions of customer pre-payments to make loans to shareholders and purchase a house and automobile for a shareholder.  Obviously the whole point of taking pre-orders and pre-payments is to develop the actual products, not to buy cars and homes, so understandable that consumers have no understanding for BFL’s excuses. Attorney Noah Wood, one of the lawyers for the customers, stated:  ""Bitcoin is an exciting and promising new technology. Unfortunately this also makes it an attractive area for people running scams and frauds. Stopping the bad actors and staying vigilant against consumer fraud is absolutely necessary for the successful development of the bitcoin ecosystem.""  The customers allege BFL may have collected over $25m in pre-payments.  Furthermore, the complaint states that Butterfly Labs violated an agreement with customers by mining bitcoins itself. The company told customers that it would not use its own gear to mine bitcoins, but it allegedly did so under the guise of testing new hardware. It is alleged that the “testing” was actually done to generate cash for BFL at the detriment of customers, as BFL used customers’ hardware to mine for bitcoins, increasing the overall mining difficulty in the process.  BFL strongly denies the allegations. A company representative told CoinDesk:  ""Butterfly Labs does not believe this lawsuit has any merit, and we are working with our attorneys to clear this up as quickly as possible.""  The complaint alleges that by the time consumers actually received their equipment it was rendered useless by the increase in computational difficulty.  It remains to be seen whether customers can prove BFL actually used the rigs for more than just “testing”. Both sides appear confident that they will have the upper hand in court.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION | TRADING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/08/butterfly-labs-faces-class-action-suit-over-pre-pay-orders,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f4df61194c5fea15fbcce2365003d5c40f9d28a2-1010x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397515,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbAoZJ,1396970370,Bank of Japan Governor: Bitcoin is Too Unreliable to be a Currency,"Governor of the Bank of Japan Haruhiko Kuroda has cast doubts on bitcoin's future as a currency.  ""Without safety or stability in its value, there would be no demand. In that sense, it cannot be a currency,"" he told reporters after a central bank policy meeting.  Kuroda added:  ""It is not a currency, and I don't think it is a general means of settlement,""  Kuroda's comments, which were reported in the The Economic Times, come after nationwide shock in Japan at the bankruptcy of the now-infamous exchange, Mt. Gox, which was based in Tokyo, and other recent bad news for bitcoin, such as possible fraudulent activity at Cyprus-based Neo & Bee.  The central bank chief's mention of stability also indicates that the perceived volatility of bitcoin is an issue of concern.  After a tremendous price spike to over $1,100 late in 2013, the value of bitcoin has since dropped, often fluctuating strongly at news reports or even rumours, and currently stands at around $450 on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index.  In time, bitcoin's volatility is likely to diminish as more merchants start accepting payments in the digital currency and it becomes less a store of value for flighty investors and more a means of buying and selling products or services.  Mt. Gox shock  When the oldest and biggest bitcoin exchange of them all, Mt. Gox imploded in spectacular fashion in late February, citing the loss by theft of 750,000 of its customers’ bitcoins, it took the nation by surprise.  The institutions of government had seemingly little knowledge of bitcoin and how to deal with the bitcoin business that had brought such unwelcome attention to the country's capital.  Initially, the government seemed unsure whether it should act on the failure of Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles to keep his customers funds safe from hackers, before finally investigating the affair.  Further, consideration caused Japan’s senior regulators to call for international regulation on bitcoin, with the Senior Vice Finance Minister Jiro Aichihttp://www.kantei.go.jp/foreign/96_abe/meibo/fukudaijin/index_e.html stating: “If we regulate [bitcoin], international collaboration would be necessary” to prevent criminals from exploiting loopholes or weak points in international law.  Later, perhaps feeling the pressure of the international media spotlight over Mt. Gox, the country's ruling party, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) – while saying that bitcoin was not a currency – launched an investigative committee into bitcoin, and blocked banks from “brokering bitcoin transactions or opening accounts holding the virtual unit”.  The latest comments from the Bank of Japan head seem a more considered response, although not entirely positive for bitcoin as a whole.

42397521,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbAodF,1396965820,Crisis in Ukraine Displays US Power Over Payment Systems,"Ukraine has returned to the top of the news agenda, with pro-Russian separatists occupying government buildings in the east of the country.  But using the levers of global finance, the conflict, with Europe and the US on one side and Russia on the other, is as much an economic battle as a physical one.  And with Russia now set on creating a new national payment system (NPS) to replace Visa and MasterCard, this fight is a reminder of the fundamental difference between the new world of decentralized digital currencies and the old world, where governments use payment systems as weapons of war.  The American monopoly on transactions  Visa and MasterCard accounted for 85% of the market share of global transactions in 2013. Although both are private companies, they are subject primarily to American law, which includes political sanctions against other countries.  The two effectively represent a de-facto monopoly on US transactions, and reminded Russian president Vladimir Putin of it after Russia annexed Crimea, when they halted credit card services to four banks linked to Russians targeted by US sanctions.  Services later resumed, but for the Russian government, whose statements on decentralised digital currencies have stood out as particularly hostile, the freeze gave them a taste of what happens when another government controls its payment infrastructure.  A Russian national payment system  In an alternative universe, the sanctions might turn Putin into a fan of Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of the original Bitcoin protocol, but in the real world it reignited plans for a Russian NPS – and the only thing worse than using a tool your enemy controls is using a tool that citizens control.  Few people outside of financial circles had heard of the Kremlin plans for an NPS before the recent political crisis in Ukraine.  First announced back in 2011, the Russian NPS is linked to an ambitious plan to create a Universal Electronic Card (UEC). The UEC is basically a personal ID, bankcard, medical insurance, social security and pension card all in one. The initiative was launched in 2010 as has slowly been rolled out since.  The recent crisis and subsequent move by Visa and MasterCard have lit a fire under Putin’s plans for financial independence. It is likely that the NPS will be up and running before the year is out, with Russia’s two largest banks, Sberbank and VTB Bank, already competing for the project.  A different name, but fundamentally the same  Russian citizens will probably not even notice the switch to a Russian NPS, as it is mainly a software change than a hardware one. ATM terminals and cash registers will be reprogrammed and people will still be able to use their current Visa and MasterCard.  The main difference is that Russia will be able to mitigate the impact of external financial sanctions on internal money transfers. It wouldn't be the first to build a national payment system. China has also built its own system, UnionPay.  But there is a clear advantage to the global use of a single payment system: international trade is lubricated by the quick and easy flow of money.  In the case of the US and Russia, opposition to America’s using the monopoly by Visa and MasterCard to enforce sanctions may lead to an alternative system in Russia. One day, it might trigger a large-scale shift to a decentralized system like bitcoin.  The consequences of that, good or bad, will be seismic.

42397519,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbAoeE,1396958698,Cryptex Bitcoin Debit Card 'Works on 90% of US ATMs',"Hong Kong startup Cryptex has launched a new 'bitcoin ATM debit card' that the company claims should work with as many as 90% of US ATMs, plus thousands more worldwide.  The Cryptex Card is an unusual hybrid that allows users to take out cash on standard bank ATMs, but with the source of the funds being, indirectly, your bitcoin wallet.  The user does not actually make direct bitcoin-to-fiat exchange transactions via the card, however.  First the card user must send bitcoins to a linked Cryptex bitcoin address. Next, a specified amount of these bitcoins are converted into fiat currency, which can then be withdrawn from regular ATMs (see the company's promo video below).  Coverage  Cryptex is a Hong Kong outfit, and unsurprisingly its ATM debit card is tied to UnionPay – China’s only domestic bank card organization.  The company says its card can be used to withdraw cash from more than 90% of ATMs installed in the US via the Discover Network.  In addition, it should work with different ATMs in 80 countries worldwide – although which networks it uses is not clear. Effectively, if the ATM accepts UnionPay, the card should work.  Pros and cons  The prospect of having a standard bitcoin card that can be used on most ATMs sounds tantalising to say the least, but there are pros and cons to consider.  Bitplastic  launched a similar card a while ago. It charges $1.50 per ATM transaction, with a daily limit of $200, which means the fee on that amount is 0.75%. However, the Bitplastic card advertises a yearly limit of just $3,500.  Cryptex has not yet revealed any fees or limits, other than to say:  ""We provide competitive exchange rates based on the amount of bitcoin you want to convert.""  However, rather than the fees, bitcoin's volatility is more of a concern when it comes to such debit cards.  Operators may offer competitive exchange rates, and conversion occurs when the withdrawal request is processed, but depending on how the price fluctuates, you can end up with more or less cash than you bargained for.  The debit card approach does have clear advantages over dedicated bitcoin ATMs, most notably the ability to withdraw from the many thousands of ATMs that already exist globally. However, they cannot process bitcoin transactions and you can’t top up a bitcoin debit card from a standard ATM.  UnionPay abuse  UnionPay has been named in a few tax-dodging schemes in China. Last month Reuters reported that state-backed bank cards, including UnionPay, are used to illegally spirit billions of dollars abroad.  Much of the money ends up in Macau and Hong Kong, where number of 'merchants' allow Chinese nationals to make fake purchases in Macau and simply turn over cash in exchange for the 'purchase'.  This is done to get around China’s strict currency export controls. Authorities in China, Macau and UnionPay officials agree that the practice is widespread and the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) is also aware of the problem.  UnionPay says its simply cannot do anything to crack down on abuse, as it has no authority over the matter.

42397487,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbAY54,1396953411,Major Security Flaw 'Heartbleed' Puts Critical Services at Risk,"Over half the internet could have been compromised by a two-year-old security flaw that also could affect a number of online bitcoin services, it was revealed today.  The vulnerability, named 'Heartbleed’, affects versions of OpenSSL, an open-source implementation of the SSL and TLS internet security protocols that encrypt and secure internet traffic, including: passwords, messages, e-commerce and banking, and other sensitive data including Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). OpenSSL is the most popular software library used for this purpose.  Two years old  The Heartbleed flaw has reportedly been known to researchers since 2011, and even 'black hat' hackers since 2012, meaning critical data on a large portion of the internet has been openly available for years. There have been no confirmed reports of exploits, though attacks leave no trace.  Security admins around the world are now hurriedly applying a fix, and changing certificates and secret keys on the off-chance they could have been compromised.  Since it weakens any site using the 'secure' https protocol, the threat isn't specifically to bitcoin services like wallets and exchanges. But given authorities' tendency to ignore bitcoin thefts or inability to investigate them effectively, it could leave bitcoin services more vulnerable than 'traditional' online financial or other critical ones.  Test your services' sites  Italian security expert Filippo Valsorda built a web-based test that allows anyone to enter a server's hostname to see if it is affected or not. He also posted open-source code for the test on GitHub.  At the time of writing, entering major bitcoin services addresses on Valsorda's site showed that Blockchain, Coinbase and BitPay were safe, but that the world's most popular exchange, Bitstamp, remained vulnerable.  Valsorda too was more concerned about online bitcoin services than anything inherent in other implementations, saying it was ""simple to exploit and not that quick to patch"".  ""It's fundamental to tell everyone to check all their servers and update ASAP [...] I can't obviously be positive about it, but bitcoin-specific software (local wallets, etc.) should not be affected even if they use OpenSSL, since the bug is only triggerable in live TLS connections.""  ""However almost everything public facing in the Bitcoin ecosystem is (rightly) secured with TLS (think all web wallets, exchanges but also APIs and Mail servers) and potentially (probably) affected.""  Rushing to patch software, rotate certs  It's estimated over 50% of internet servers use some form of OpenSSL (and probably a lot more). The thought that over half the internet's sensitive data could have been exposed for two years has left security departments sweating.  Exploiting Heartbleed, an attacker could access the RAM of affected systems, allowing them to see up to 64 kilobytes of data at a time – enough to build up enough knowledge to access a system's secret keys. Those keys are used to encrypt and decrypt sensitive traffic and identify service providers.  Once secret keys are gained, attackers could read any traffic to and from a server openly or impersonate services and users.  Attacks on a vulnerable system do not require man-in-the-middle techniques and leave no trace, leaving sysadmins with no sure way to know if their systems have been compromised.  The extent of the potential damage left some reeling:    Heartbleed is a rare bug: a failure in a crypto library that leaks data beyond what it's protecting. So worse than no crypto at all.      – matt blaze (@mattblaze) 8th April 2014        Mike Hearn  , developer and chair of the Bitcoin Foundation's Law and Policy Committee, said he hoped the impact on bitcoin services would be limited, but noted that bitcoin services didn't always employ best practices for security:  ""I'm hoping the impact will be limited. Major sites will have to rotate their SSL keys after upgrading [...] Most sites should have the private keys for their wallets in a different server process where the data cannot be extracted this way. However it will not surprise me if a few sites are not working this way for whatever reason and might suffer thefts.""  Companies react  Following the news, many bitcoin and altcoin exchanges took to twitter to issue official responses and update users on their progress tackling the flaw.    #Bitstamp turns off its accregistration, login & all virtual currency withdrawal functions as a precaution following recent OpenSSL news.      — Bitstamp (@Bitstamp) April 8, 2014        In an interview with CoinDesk, Bitstamp CEO Nejc Kodrič revealed that although the company had patched its servers successfully, its DDoS mitigation provider, Incapsula, must do the same to ensure full security.  Hence, the exchange has chosen to remain ""on the safe side"" and temporarily deactivate account registrations, account logins and all virtual currency withdrawal functions.  Other exchanges have since issued similar statements via the platform, including Bitfinex – a recent addition to CoinDesk's BPI.    Heartbleed bug fixed on Bitfinex, withdrawals are disabled for now until we make sure everyone is safe      — Bitfinex.com (@bitfinex) April 8, 2014        Meanwhile, platforms like localbitcoins.com and Bitcurex have reported greater success:    We are up again, heartbleed bug fixed. http://t.co/OwP9Ft1dE7      — LocalBitcoins.com (@LocalBitcoins) April 8, 2014    Blockchain.info also released a statement via its website stating that it upgraded services a week ago. The company also emphasised that wallet passwords are never sent to its server.  It added: “We’ll be continuing to investigate as needed and provide you with any necessary updates.""  Public information release  News of Heartbleed's existence was released by Finnish IT security consultancy Codenomicon, who published the description after trying the exploit for itself. A Google Security engineer, Neel Mehta, reported it to the OpenSSL team while Adam Langley and Bodo Moeller prepared a fix.  The name comes from the bug's existence in OpenSSL's 'heartbeat' extension, and does not represent any flaw in the SSL/TLS protocol itself.  Codenomicon said exploitation was 'easy' and that it had successfully attacked its own services, gaining access to secret keys for X.509 certificates, user names and passwords, and other 'business critical' communications.  OpenSSL's security advisory said Heartbleed affected 1.0.1 and 1.0.2-beta releases of the software library, including 1.0.1f and 1.0.2-beta1.  ""A missing bounds check in the handling of the TLS heartbeat extension can be used to reveal up to 64k of memory to a connected client or server,"" it read, advising users to either upgrade immediately or remove heartbeats from their version of OpenSSL by recompiling it with -DOPENSSL_NO_HEARTBEATS.""

Costing €2,900 (around $3,993), the stand-alone machine offers a generous 17-inch touchscreen and has the ability to accept any fiat currency. Additionally, it can accept or dispense any digital currency, according to the company’s website.  Operators of the Sumo Pro are able to link up with any exchange partner's API to facilitate the supply of digital currencies, improve liquidity and enhance security.  The machine offers a web-based back-end, so owners can keep an eye on cash flow, profits, or change settings such as the fiat-to-bitcoin exchange rate from their web browser. Furthermore, proprietors can opt to receive SMS notifications for things like transactions or fund balance.  For businesses that need to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) laws, the machine provides an identification check on customers using the device’s ATM function, which can be further enhanced with an optional fingerprint scanner.  How it works  As illustrated in the video below, the Sumo Pro offers a quick and easy method for customers to pay for products or services using their mobile devices.  In the restaurant example shown, the waitress sets up a transaction at payment time by logging into her staff account and entering the bill total, then prints out a paper receipt for the customer.  The customer then scans the QR code on the receipt into his or her digital wallet, checks the amount, then clicks ‘send’. The transaction indicates it’s complete soon after on the Sumo Pro screen, and the customer is free to go – or do the washing up if they don't have sufficient funds.  The process looks very simple – certainly as easy as paying with a credit card – and the Sumo Pro also provides a reassuringly professional looking front end that should help to inspire confidence in new bitcoin customers possibly made wary by recent media gloom surrounding cryptocurrencies.  The BitXatm machine also offers merchants the chance to bring in some extra income via interest on transactions when the Sumo Pro is used in its ATM mode.  Competitive market  The Sumo Pro is manufactured in Romania, according to BitXatm. It will start shipping machines in May. If they sell out, there will be a 30-day pre-order window for new purchases.  The company faces increasing competition from other startups in the bitcoin ATM arena: Robocoin has seen great success and sends machines all over the globe, as does Lamassu, who also plans to enhance its machines for other bitcoin services, such as remittances. Other companies are also gearing up for the fray.  However, the unique selling proposition of the Sumo Pro is its user-friendly POS feature. If it really is as simple as the video would have us believe, it may be a product that will start finding its way into the mainstream.  BitXatm also aims to carve itself a decent slice of the market with the very competitive €2,900 price tag. Robocoin (at $20,000) and Lamassu (at $5,000) are both pricer and offer fewer functions – for now. Yesterday’s announcement of a €1,000 ATM from PayMaQ may worry the company, but their machine lacks the attractive POS function of the Sumo Pro.  This is the kind of technology that many have been pushing for: easy-to-use, with elegant systems to ease the on-ramp for consumers and businesses alike entering the world of digital currencies.
