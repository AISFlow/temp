42397326,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapZnf,1387393186,Russia's Biggest Search Engine Launches Bitcoin Conversion Tool,"Russian search engine Yandex has started tracking the exchange rate of bitcoin for the US dollar, the euro and the British pound, but oddly enough not the Russian rouble.  Yandex is by far the biggest search engine in Russia, with a 60% market share. It also has a big following in several of the countries that are part of the Commonwealth of Independent States. In 2011 Yandex managed to raise $1.3bn in a NASDAQ initial public offering, the biggest IPO since Google went public seven years earlier. The company also operates an e-commerce payment system, dubbed Yandex.Money.  As of this week, the search engine allows users to check the bitcoin exchange rate directly, simply by typing in specific requests like bitcoin rate or bitcoin price in the search box. The converter springs into action, showing how many euros, pounds or dollars the specified amount of bitcoin is worth, based on the current exchange rate. It appears that the tool uses the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index in its calculations.  Yandex employs a very similar converter for all major currencies. As we said, the Russian rouble is conspicuously absent from the list of supported currencies, at least for the time being. Digit.ru asked Yandex why the Rouble was not included and the answer was simple – the main trading floors in Russia report the BTC rate against the US dollar, not the national currency.  As soon as the traders convert to roubles, Yandex will include roubles in its block information based on SERP, to address the matter and extend support to roubles, the company told Digit.ru.  It is interesting to point out that Yandex.Money launched a couple of years ago as a universal internet payment solution for merchants, businesses and other organisations. The service is limited to Russia and a handful of other countries, but it allows users to add most popular payment methods to their websites with relative ease.  There is still no word on bitcoin support though and it is unclear whether true digital currencies will ever be embraced by Yandex.Money.  At the moment, the service supports MasterCard and Visa and it allows users to make cash payments via 170,000 payment terminals throughout the country. Mobile payments are also supported on select carriers and customers pay no fees if they make payments using cards, cash or e-money. Yandex.Money is currently the largest internet payment system in Russia, with more than 14 million users as of mid-2013.

42397325,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapZlh,1387386313,OKCoin's New Bitcoin and Litecoin Fees Cause a Stir on Social Media,"OKCoin's decision to reinstate user trading fees this week has caused a stir among bitcoin traders.  The bitcoin and litecoin exchange became the second major Chinese exchange to reinstate user trading fees this week, announcing on Monday (16th December) that a 0.3% fee would be charged on each bitcoin transaction made and 0.2% for litecoin transactions.  Many bitcoin traders took to social media platforms such as Sina Weibo to complain about the perceived injustice of it all.  In response, Star Xu (Xu Mingxing), founding CEO of OKCoin, issued a statement on 17th December. In an emotionally-charged article that was published on the exchange's forum, Xu alerted users that the speculative craze could cause serious harm to bitcoin's prospects.  Xu added that the purpose of the fee policy is to alleviate speculative activities and is in compliance with the Chinese Central Bank's spirit of strengthening regulation on bitcoin exchanges.  The CEO also noted that some traders have been engaged in program-controlled speed trading in efforts to manipulate the bitcoin exchange rate, which has, in effect, exacerbated the currency's volatility.  When highlighting the danger of over-speculation, Xu cited an example of an accountant who told him that she spent her company's entire month's salary to buy bitcoins to make a quick profit.  The article concludes with a rather idealistic-sounding plea:    I want to reiterate what I have said in many other occasions: Bitcoin is a social experiment and every experiment carries the risk of failure.      If you are joining because someone told you that its value will double, please go away; If you have no idea what bitcoin is, please go away; if you are a big-time international investor, please have some restraint, don't put bitcoin in a situation that will have no return.    We like its elegant mathematical design, and believe in the great ideal behind it. We want to protect the experiment as we can.    When BTC China reinstated its fees, it published this statement:  Dear BTC China valued customer: To stabilize the recent turbulent Bitcoin market and minimize potential market manipulation, BTC China will end the 0% trading fee promotion, effective immediately, and revert to the 0.3% trading fee. We deeply apologize for the sudden change. BTC China, December 16, 2013  The companies took this action after news emerged that the People's Bank of China had met with the country's third-party payment companies and told them they can no longer do business with bitcoin exchanges.  This news seemed to cause a wave of panic selling, with the price of bitcoin falling from around $880 early on Monday morning (GMT) to $422 at around 11:00 today.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | LTC | TRADING,Eric Mu,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/12/18/okcoins-new-bitcoin-and-litecoin-fees-cause-a-stir-on-social-media,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ca47418cb42ad9557f7cd4f9ecd30962940abab6-1079x722.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397312,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapZYu,1387383040,Coincove Uses Bitcoin to Make Remittance Easier in Latin America,"Money remittance can be expensive, difficult and time consuming. However, currency market Coincove hopes to change this for its Latin American customers.  Using the Localbitcoins platform, Coincove allows its customers to take their fiat money to a local bitcoin dealer in-person.  From there, Coincove translates their currency into a USD value on its website so that customers can move money to different countries around the world.  Entry and exit nodes  The company plans to allow users to see the BTC value of their accounts in the future, but right now bitcoin is simply the conduit or 'pipe' through which the money moves. Tomas Alvarez, CEO of Coincove, told CoinDesk:  ""We are basing Coincove in local marketplaces, and using them as entry and exit nodes.”  To start, the company has chosen four countries to operate in: Argentina, Mexico, Spain and Chile.  “We picked Argentina because they tend to be a forward-looking country, and their current economic situation makes them more willing to try new ideas,” said Alvarez.  “Mexico, Spain and Chile were picked because they have important Argentinian communities that need to be linked economically to their homeland.”  Industry competition  Coincove has some serious competition in the money remittance industry. Alvarez pointed to “really established ones like Western Union and MoneyGram as well as newer ones such as Xoom,” as his company's biggest rivals.  Many of the big remittance players have had issues in Argentina. Yet, this is exactly where Coincove hopes to succeed.  “Another reason we picked Argentina is that all these services have been seriously restricted or completely shut down, which allows us to enter a market relatively free of competition.”  Coincove sees some risk in using local bitcoin markets. This is especially true given that a lack of liquidity may create price points that don’t represent bitcoin’s market value.  “On a system-wide level, we worry about bitcoin liquidity in local markets. The exchange rate people can expect when they come in and out of the system relies on a healthy choice of local exchangers,” he said.  “Fortunately, since the conception of our idea a few months ago, we have seen the local bitcoin communities in our target countries grow at a fast pace.”  Regulation is also a concern for Alvarez, given that his company is operating in several different countries and hopes to expand in the future. “Our greatest concern is the regulatory environment,” he said.  “None of the countries we have picked have passed any ruling regarding bitcoin. We are convinced that this legal situation won't last long and that eventually most countries will pass laws covering bitcoin.”  Coincove is one of three bitcoin-related startups currently operating at the Boost VC incubator in San Mateo, California.  They will be pitching their business to investors during Boost’s Demo Day in February 2014.

42397310,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapZWw,1387377654,Europe's First Bitcoin ATM Installed in Finland,"Helsinki, Finland. A place best-known for islands, forts and Linux pioneer Linus Torvalds, has made the news as the official home of Europe’s first bitcoin ATM.  Earlier this month, Swedish bitcoin exchange Safellohttps://safello.com/en/index.xhtml announced that it would deploy the first bitcoin ATM in downtown Stockholm.  However, it appears that Finland beat them to the punch, which is hardly surprising, given the long rivalry between the Scandinavian nations.  Railway tracks  According to Finnish exchange Bittiraha, who run the back-end systems, the machine has been installed in a record store at the Helsinki Railway Station.  Of course, this is not the first bitcoin ATM in Europe, as similar units have been deployed in Sweden and Slovakia, but this appears to be the first permanent ATM in Europe.  The railway station is one of the busiest spots in the city: an estimated 200,000 people walk through the lobby every day. The record store, Levykauppa Ax, has a habit of experimenting with new marketing techniques.  Some might argue that the decision to install a bitcoin ATM is just another publicity stunt. Levykauppa Ax commercial director Jyri Lipponen said:  ""Actually, we aren't sure about anything when it comes to bitcoin, but we most definitely want to participate in anything which could shake up the traditional foundations of society.""  The company also says it is looking into bitcoin integration for its e-commerce platform. The ATM will allow customers to make purchases in bitcoin and to buy bitcoins for cash in the store.  Lamassu overseas  The ATM is, of course, a Lamassu unit. The company shipped its first bitcoin ATMs back in October, but these were destined for the US market.  However, Lamassu has also shipped units to Bratislava, Shanghai, Paris, Montreal, Sydney, Nimbin, Auckland, Copenhagen, Sao Paulo, Helsinki and Stockholm.  The second batch, which was scheduled to ship in late November, included 25 units.  Lamassu CEO Zach Harvey told CoinDesk that the company is accepting orders for its third production run, which is scheduled to ship in the first quarter of 2014.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/12/18/europes-first-bitcoin-atm-installed-in-finland,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/43745f9954669923301f171d415aaf63b5344ba0-1024x768.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397327,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapZoe,1387372532,Litecoin Price Mirrors Bitcoin's Plunge After China News,"Over the past 48 hours of trading, bitcoin has experienced one of the biggest crashes in its history. At press time bitcoin is hovering around the $500 mark.  The price dive was precipitated by Chinese regulators, who recently moved to ban third-party payment firms from dealing with bitcoin exchanges.  The price began tumbling on 16th December, briefly dropping south of $700 and recording a 22% loss in just 24 hours.  Since then, it has lost an additional $200 and earlier this morning the currency hit a low of $479. At press time bitcoin was trading at $542, 20% down from Tuesday’s close of $682.  Bitcoin price drop takes its toll on litecoin  Although some investors believed investing in litecoin would help to broaden and stabilize their portfolio, the events of the last 24 hours appear to have proven them spectacularly wrong.  Litecoin crashed too, almost as if it was pegged to bitcoin, which in some sense it is.  Many exchanges do not offer LTC/USD services and as a result much of the volume is coming from LTC/BTC trades. In other words, when bitcoin goes down, it drags litecoin down with it.  In fact, litecoin charts from the past 48 hours look like a carbon copy of their bitcoin counterparts.  In the early hours of Monday (GMT time) litecoin was trading in the high twenties, but by the end of the day it was going for as little as $22.60.  On Tuesday litecoin shed more value, dropping to $18.53 before it briefly bounced up to $23.30, albeit on relatively light volume.  Wednesday saw another tumble. Although litecoin opened at $19.80 and it quickly passed the $20 mark, this was once again on light volume.  However, five hours later, with volume skyrocking – the price tumbled first to $18.90 and then a low of $13.00 at press time.  In essence, the numbers mimic those of bitcoin, with a slight delay. Volume remains heavy, but the LTC/BTC rate is relatively stable, in the 0.029 to 0.034 range.  The rate is holding steady for now, indicating that litecoin is no safe haven for bitcoin investors.  How bad can it get?  Bitcoin appears to have stabilized north of $500, but at this point it is hard to make any predictions.  The Chinese market is crippled, although some exchanges are still taking deposits. It remains to be seen whether these exchanges can remain open for business.  Judging by volume and price over the past two days, litecoin is effectively linked to bitcoin, so it may stabilize, provided bitcoin does not slide further.  At press time, litecoin is bouncing back, with recent trades in the $14-$15 range on six-digit volumes.  It's also important to note that recent bitcoin warnings issued by central banks and regulators in several major markets do not apply solely to bitcoin, they address all digital currencies including bitcoin.  In other words, even if it weren’t for the relatively stable LTC/BTC rate, moves made by regulators are bound to affect both currencies in exactly the same way.

42397319,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapZeo,1387368609,SnapCard's Founders Talk Bitcoin Volatility and Early Adopters,"San Fransico-based startup snapCard was founded earlier this year by Michael Dunworth and Ioannis Giannaros, with the aim to make bitcoin an everyday, liquid currency.  The Boost-funded company provides a service which lets bitcoin enthusiasts shop online with their cryptocurrency. It promotes itself as: ""The easiest way to buy anything on the Internet using bitcoin.""  In their interview with CoinDesk, Dunworth and Giannaros discuss e-commerce, the holiday season and how early adopters have fuelled the company’s recent success.  What is snapCard?  Michael Dunworth: SnapCard is a simple way for people to buy things online using their bitcoins. It helps make merchants aware of the demand from the bitcoin community for merchants to start accepting bitcoin. So that’s what we do. We are basically a facility where people can go and place orders with all the major websites, so that they can start spending their bitcoin.  Are we talking about the United States or Globally?  Ioannis Giannaros: Right now it’s globally. We’ve shipped out products to Germany and the UK.  So there’s no actual “card” as the snapCard name suggests. You’re more of a “cart”?  IG: Yeah. So, essentially you can go on all of these websites, add products into your snapCard account and press 'purchase'. In the back end, we send you an invoice within 20 minutes. After that, you pay the invoice (in BTC) and we process the order.  Let’s talk about the back end. Does this work with only certain shopping carts?  IG: It’s a bookmarklet that overlays every single site. Obviously, we can’t get all sites perfect. But I think we’re doing a pretty good job making alterations to work with all the sites.  Does it use JavaScript?  MD: Yeah, it’s a JavaScript-based bookmarklet.  Are you using Coinbase or BitPay for this?  IG: There’s two options. You can attach your Coinbase account and it automatically debits your account. Or, as an alternative, a lot of people wanted an invoice option. They wanted to see the transaction fees and our 2% fee. Sometimes (customers) want to see how it breaks down. We send them an invoice, they see the breakdown and then they pay with a QR code address. We use BitPay for the order processing for that.  Do you know when your time at Boost ends? When will you be pitching?  IG: The first week of February. And that’s going to be exciting, all the companies in here are super cool, they’re doing super awesome stuff. The weekly metrics are very, very impressive. Obviously, ours are pretty high right now, just because of the holiday season. But we have options. We have different ideas on how to maintain in the future.  How are you going to do that? Because you’re riding a good wave right now. What are you going to do when there’s the hangover in January?  IG: We have some options. Definitely some referral programs to keep momentum going. And just expanding marketing. We are pretty confident we can maintain steady growth.  MD: The thing that’s going to happen is that the growth is going to shift. The userbase will grow, but the dollar amount might not so much. So, while the spending will decrease once the holidays end, the userbase will grow. So I think that retaining our current position is not unattainable.  You guys are coming into this at a time when the price is going up. How do you think bitcoin's volatility could affect you?  MD: I don’t think it’s going to have that much of an impact, to be honest.  IG: Not at the moment.  MD: It’s not going to affect early bitcoin adopters. If they go to buy a computer with bitcoin, and bitcoin was at $1,300, and now it’s at $950, they are still only going to be paying 1.5 BTC or 1 BTC.  So the price, even if it dips a lot, isn't going to affect early adopters. It may affect the new people who just bought in at around $300 or something like that.  But the very early adopters, which is sort of the type of people we have on board (as snapCard customers), those people are not so much affected by these minor swings.  So you have a bunch of early bitcoin adopters as customers?  IG: From their spending habits, it seems like they are. I’ll be completely frank, we have over 950 active users right now, and I believe that the majority of them were early adopters.  MD: We’ve not been promoting it, but sort of spreading word that we exist through the reddit bitcoin community. Reddit, along with Bitcoin Talk, are at the forefront of what’s going on.  IG: That CoinDesk article about us helped as well.

42376766,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eGMJ,1387361073,Bitcoin Price Falls Further as BTC China Exchange Shuts Off Fiat Deposits,"UPDATED on 18th December at 17:10 (GMT)  BTC China told CoinDesk it is expecting to reinstate deposits in RMB soon. Bobby Lee said he is now working with another third party payment company to try and reinstate RMB pricing, and is hoping to make an announcement on the Weibo account in the next few hours.  This will now be the firm’s third payment provider relationship inside a week. Lee brushed off worries that the new relationship could also be placed in jeopardy by PBOC’s most recent move.  “If this keeps happening, ten times later, will I keep going? I don’t know. I can’t predict the future. But for now we’re going to try one more time, to see,” he said.  ------------------------------------  The price of bitcoin plummeted still further this morning, after news emerged that at least one exchange in China had blocked deposits made in RMB (Chinese yuan), the national fiat currency.  China’s and indeed the world's largest bitcoin exchange, BTC China, announced that it would disallow those deposits in a post on its verified Weibo account.  Bobby Lee, CEO of BTC China, said: ""This morning, we got notice from our third-party payment provider YeePay that it would cut off deposits for us at 12 noon and sure enough, we got cut off today.""  YeePay had given the company two hours’ notice, he said. The exchange had only just signed a deal with the third party payment provider on Monday, following an abrupt termination of its agreement with third party payment firm TenPay on Sunday.  ""We all know the reason – it's as plain as daylight – they cut us off because of what happened at the meeting on Monday,"" he added.  Lee was referring to the meeting between the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) and third-party payment companies, in which the payment firms were told to stop dealing with bitcoin exchanges.  No official statement has been issued by PBOC or any of the third-party payment processors about this, and Lee thinks it is possible that this will remain the case. ""If they wanted to issue something official, they would have done already.""  Earlier this month, banks had also been told not to deal with exchanges, removing the ability for customers to use web-based payment systems directly integrated with the exchanges via APIs.  [post-quote]  ""Right now we, as a bitcoin exchange, have suspended taking all deposits in RMB. But, on the withdrawal side, people still have the ability to withdraw RMB. There should be no worries – all the money is safe, secure and is all accounted for,"" said Lee.  Customers are also still able to deposit and withdraw bitcoins from BTC China.  The news had a severe effect on bitcoin pricing over a few hours, forcing it down to levels not seen in a month. At the time of writing, the price was bouncing back from a low of $488, down from a high of $990 last week, putting it at its lowest point in the past few weeks.  Jack Wang, a bitcoin entrepreneur about to start a virtual currency company in Beijing, said that this would force the market to find alternative ways to develop.  “Without exchanges, the market will have to find different business models that use bitcoin, which the government has acknowledged to be legal and property.""  We asked Bobby Lee what's next for BTC China. ""At this point, it's too early to speculate. We're taking each day at a time. We are a startup, we are nimble and flexible and we will adjust to the marketplace,"" he said.  Editor's note:  Previously, this article stated that, up until today, customers wanting to deposit RMB into their bitcoin exchange accounts were able to do so in two ways: via an Internet transaction, and as a direct deposit over the counter. CoinDesk said that after Dec 5, the first option had been removed, while the second was still valid until today.  CoinDesk has since spoken to Bobby Lee again, who clarified that all payments from banks require third party processor involvement, and that Internet payments from banks had been possible until his relationship with TenPay and subsequently YeePay were severed. Without these relationships, it was unable to process RMB payments into its customers’ accounts.  “That’s where the problem showed up. If we’re not allowed to deal with third party payment companies then they can’t take deposits for us on behalf of customers, and then we have this catch-22 where we can no longer operate our bitcoin exchange as before,” Lee said.

Membership of the Australian Bitcoin Association is open to Australian citizens only. The ABA's constitution stipulates that the organisation has eight board member positions, seven of which are already filled. The remaining seat is open to both corporate members and individuals.  Membership fees are in line with the US bitcoin Foundation, with whom the Australian association has signed an affiliate agreement. This makes it the first national association outside the US to do so.  Board members  The board of directors currently includes three programmers who are working on a Bitcoin Client, as well as legal and PR experts. They have indicated that they are looking for a legal researcher to join as the final board member.  According to founding member Tristan Winters, the Association is a non-profit organisation whose main function will be to act as a first point of contact for government; liaising with them to help craft a coherent and functional policy towards bitcoin users and businesses.  They also aim to hold the first Australian Bitcoin conference in Sydney next year.  Currently, they have one business and one individual on their books, but remain optimistic that more members will sign up in the future.
