Meanwhile, the ether options market suggests a roller coaster ride ahead for the world’s second largest cryptocurrency.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $11,868 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 1.8% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $11,528-$11,915  BTC above 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish signal for market technicians.    It’s been a positive week for bitcoin so far. The world’s oldest cryptocurrency is continuing its rebound from a Sunday price crash, appreciating 12% on a bullish run that isn’t showing signs of slowing down.      Read More: Bitcoin Rises More in One Day Than Stocks Have Gained All Year      “Bitcoin reached above $12,000 on Aug. 2, but its ascension was stopped short,” said Jean-Baptiste Pavageau, a partner at quantitative trading firm ExoAlpha. “However, the impact on bitcoin was short-lived, and a breakout above $12,500 on high volume would definitely put BTC on the way.”      For Pavageau, history may never repeat but it does often rhyme. “If one looks at how the price of bitcoin moved after the second halving in 2016, the path taken so far is highly similar: A sideways period of six to eight weeks post-halving, followed by a run-up and a correction before heading to all-time highs a few months later.”      Read More: Bitmain Delays Bitcoin Miner Shipments by Three Months      Henrik Kueglberg, a Sweden-based over-the-counter bitcoin trader, says the grim realities of the global economy continue to make the case for investment in cryptocurrencies over the next few months as well. “Let’s get real. Stocks will fall and interest rates will be kept low. I expect another bitcoin all-time high in September and increasing prices all through Q4.”    Record ether options open interest    Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization (ETH), was down Thursday trading around $397 and slipping 0.45% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Read More: Ethereum Classic Suffers Second 51% Attack in a Week      The ether options market is on an absolute tear and seeing huge amounts of bets. Open interest is now approaching $400 million. Most of it is on Netherlands-based platform Deribit, which leads the way with $351 million, according to data from aggregator Skew. Options give owners to the right, though not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset.      “Open interest is now 2.5 times higher than it was just a few weeks ago, touching a new record,” noted Chris Thomas, head of digital assets for broker Swissquote.      “There’s almost zero real institutional volume through these exchanges,” said Thomas. He indicated those using ether options are high-net-worth individuals or small cryptocurrency funds preparing for increased ETH volatility. “The options market has now caught up with the underlying (ether) and is anticipating further moves in the near future as implied volatility is now greater than realized volatility,” he added.      When implied volatility is greater than realized volatility, it generally means that the market expects increased price fluctuations are ahead.

42432458,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNZm1h,1596730708,"Blockchain Bites: Bulls Reborn, Backrunning Bots, Bitmain Blowout","Ethereum Classic was hit again, Instagram is seeing a proliferation of crypto scams and shipments of Bitmain's latest bitcoin mining machines have been delayed.      You’re reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they’re significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.    Top shelf    Double Trouble Ethereum Classic has suffered its second 51% attack in a week after more than 4,000 blocks were reorganized Thursday morning. A chain reorg occurs when a party gains more hashing power than the rest of the network miners, allowing them to rewrite the chain’s history and “double-spend” its crypto. Bitfly and Binance reported the reorganization, announcing all Ethereum Classic payouts, withdrawals and deposits had been suspended due to the attack. The network has suffered major reorg attacks at least twice in the last two years. In late July, hackers moved more than 807,000 ETC from an unspecified crypto exchange to several wallets, according to Bitquery.      Crypto-Gram Scams Crypto scams are running rampant on Instagram, and attempts at moderation sometimes adversely affect real crypto influencers on the platform. There are more than 1.3 million Instagram posts using #Coinbase, an overwhelming number of which display inauthentic behavior. In July, at least three crypto influencers were temporarily locked out of their platforms as Instagram attempted to stymie scams. Still, Instagram has become a conduit to inform and engage with audiences – particularly in the developing world, where many people rely on mobile phones to access the internet.      Power Struggle An internal power struggle between Bitmain’s founders has delayed production by months. Orders of the mining giant’s latest machines expected in June and July will now arrive in September and October, the company said via one of its official WeChat accounts. The delay is caused by ""external interference over the company's management,"" the official account said. Bitcoin miners are typically sold via pre-orders that are placed two to three months in advance – meaning customers who ordered the machines due this summer could have placed their orders as early as March.      ""Test Case"" Conflict-ridden Ukraine is embracing cryptocurrency. “Our political situation is somewhat unstable, and Ukrainians are tech savvy, so this combination creates incentives for people fleeing from fiat to crypto,” Gleb Naumenko, a Ukrainian Bitcoin developer who recently got a $100,000 grant from BitMEX, said. With the national currency losing value, people are exploring technological means, he said, but that doesn’t mean the government is trying to squash development. Regulators are working with crypto entrepreneurs to develop a framework to support crypto, which could remain a competitive jurisdiction for crypto startups, Alex Bornyakov, deputy minister for digital transformation, said.      EOS Ethics A judge choosing the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit against Block.one has expressed concern over the motivations of some parties. The case, which alleges EOS’ creator committed securities fraud, could stretch on for many years, making it a lucrative prospect for the lead plaintiff's legal team, District Judge Lewis Kaplan said. A class-action lawsuit for five investors showed a distinct lack of diligence and commitment that made them unsuitable to become the lead plaintiff in the Block.one lawsuit. Known as the ""Williams Group,"" Judge Kaplan said the plaintiffs had submitted incomplete, inaccurate and unsubstantiated trading data that failed to show how much money they lost from investing in the EOS initial coin offering (ICO).    Quick bites  Investors suing over Status ICO can’t find the executives to serve papers.  Reflexer Labs raised $1.7 million to build a somewhat-stable coin for DeFi.  U.S. Congressman Tom Emmer says “Bitcoin ain't going away.” (The Block)  Crypto venture firm Draper Goren Holm goes big on DeFi. (Decrypt)  At stake    Three days ago David Portnoy, founder of Barstool Sports, invited the Winklevoss twins to explain bitcoin to him.      Portnoy, who the New York Times christened “the captain of the day traders,” transitioned from sports media to market commentary during the coronavirus crisis. He’s become the face of the growing crowd of Robinhood and fin-twit investors, who gather around daily livestreams where Portnoy picks stocks and “half screams into a microphone.”      Portnoy is clear he’s not offering investment advice. In fact, it’s unclear what he’s offering. His catchphrase of “stocks only go up” walks the line between parody and a sincere appraisal of irrational markets during this age of monetary expansion and experimentation. Facetious or not, Portnoy has a band of loyal followers with enough weight to move markets.      “What all these new market gamblers seem to have in common is utter contempt for the system – almost any system,” the Wall Street Journal wrote in a profile of Portnoy.      If that statement were true, Portnoy likely would have found himself to bitcoin sooner. As it is, a recent market move towards $12,000 caught his eye – hence his invitation to the Winklevii. “I want to buy all the bitcoins,” he added later.      ""Amazing,"" Messari’s Ryan Selkis tweeted. Many in the crypto industry see this as a bullish opportunity. The real benefit may be in the mirror Portnoy holds up to crypto, exposing irrationalities, just as he does in fintwit.      As Nathaniel Whittemore noted, Portnoy admitted he didn’t know how to buy bitcoin, found wallets confusing and claimed he may have already lost his stake – all potential barriers to entry to less-savvy individuals.    Market intel    Hedge Trimmings Bitcoin prices surged 5% on Wednesday, outpacing stocks and gold amid calls for more government stimulus. Bitcoin rose to $11,755 and is now approaching $12,000 for the second time in a week, a level that bitcoin hasn’t sustainably traded above for more than a year. Bets are growing that governments and central banks will have to pump trillions of dollars more into the financial system to stimulate the economy out of the worst recession since the 1930s. Gold surged this week to a new record above $2,000 – a 35% gain this year that falls short of bitcoin’s 63% price increase. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index is now up 3% on the year, with some traditional investors arguing that stocks have become detached from reality. This insight comes from First Mover, which you can subscribe to here.      Dollar's Decline Publicly traded business intelligence company MicroStrategy said it will invest $250 million of its excess cash in bitcoin, gold and other “alternative assets” over the next 12 months as a hedge against U.S. dollar (USD) inflation. CEO Michael Saylor said the weakening USD is no longer a tenable place to park MicroStrategy’s $500 million cash reserves. Near-zero interest rates, infinite helicopter money and the specter of coming inflation are all forces Saylor said are chipping away at the dollar.    Tech pod    Backrunning Bots An architectural quirk in the most-used software version of Ethereum, Geth, has led to an uptick in spams, according to Certus One co-founder Hendrik Hofstadt. Transaction spamming is one reason the average Ethereum user fee has increased some 800% since May. Algorithmic trading firms have created bot swarms to watch the Ethereum transaction queue (called the mempool). These bots wait for large trades on DeFi platforms such as Uniswap. After they go through, the bots quickly place orders to take advantage of price movements in what is called “backrunning.”    Op-ed    Bulls Reborn Anil Lulla, COO of Delphi Digital, thinks crypto is due for a bull run. Converging forces of the larger, inflationary economy is the test case for bitcoin and a trend of investors reallocating capital away from “ghost protocols” (the dying token projects from the last bull cycle) into more promising DeFi applications. “The foundation for the base infrastructure of the decentralized economy is being laid as we speak. The composability between projects allow teams to iterate much faster than traditional software companies and opens up experimentation going forward,” he writes.      Lessons Learned Lex Sokolin, CoinDesk columnist and Global Fintech co-head at ConsenSys, thinks the U.S. can learn from China’s experimentation with open-source technologies. “Competition in the next century is going to be far more complex than intellectual property ownership. It is going to be waged over multinational open-source networks, reintegrating finances and economies into a digital global superstructure. We have to develop clearer ways of thinking about this competition, and in this entry we will discuss one such framework,” he writes.    Podcast corner    Going Stag Keith McCullough, CEO of financial media and research firm Hedgeye, sits down to talk about stagflation, Bitcoin and why the “Old Wall” media distracts rather than educates in the latest episode of The Breakdown.

42394464,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvkhKX,1596727565,Bitcoin's Patronage System Is an Unheralded Strength,"CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter is partner at Castle Island Ventures, a public blockchain-focused venture fund based in Cambridge, Mass. He is also the cofounder of Coin Metrics, a blockchain analytics startup.  A quietly important phenomenon has gained steam in the last few months. And I’m not referring to Grayscale gobbling up all the new coins or Cash App’s bitcoin volumes exploding.  Bitcoin’s patronage system – how future network development is funded – has gained unheralded strength, with many more entities signing on as sponsors. These groups recognize that sponsoring the core developers who keep the system running is profoundly important to keeping this public infrastructure moving ahead.  See also: Nic Carter - The Last Word on Bitcoin's Energy Consumption  For a long time, Blockstream, Chaincode and the MIT Digital Currency Initiative were the major patrons sponsoring core developers. Thanks to their support, a handful of the most critical and engaged developers were able to commit their time fully to Bitcoin. However, many more developers active on the Bitcoin codebase or ancillary projects remained unfunded and had to split their time between Bitcoin development and day jobs.  In 2019, Square Crypto burst on the scene and announced its intention to fund a variety of Bitcoin projects, both relating to the main codebase but also targeting less conventional improvements to Bitcoin’s design and user experience. Notably, its first grant was to BTCPayServer, a project dedicated to facilitating bitcoin acceptance among merchants. This signaled a broadening of the universe of grant-worthy projects and inspired several other organizations to throw their hat into the ring.  Today, the Bitcoin patronage environment is encouragingly vibrant and diverse. Numerous organizations have recognized the favorable economics of supporting Bitcoin development. In 2020 alone, BitMEX has added to its commitments, venture fund Paradigm has jumped into the ring with a sponsorship of Anthony Towns, exchanges Kraken, BTSE and OKCoin made material grants to BTCPayServer, and Square Crypto made a blizzard of grants to a wide variety of entities.  No other public blockchains have Bitcoin’s combination of industry buy-in, accumulated credibility, and neutrality from inception.  For a fuller accounting of Bitcoin patronage initiatives, see this piece from BitMEX Research, with supplemental information here. In short, Bitcoin’s patronage environment has gone from one in which a half dozen core developers were subsidized by a handful of institutions, to a setting where dozens of individuals and projects – many of which lie entirely outside the domain of “Core” – are able to obtain financing from a much larger variety of donors.  Until recently, it had been virtually impossible for individuals to make tax-deductible donations to Bitcoin development (one shudders in recollection of the Bitcoin Foundation). This changed when the Human Rights Foundation announced its Bitcoin Development Fund last month, which comes wrapped in a helpful 501(c)(3) format. For individuals who want to donate directly to core developers, several Bitcoin developers have signed up to Github’s new Sponsors program.  This is incredibly encouraging. Not only is essential but costly security review being funded, but non-Core public goods like BTCPayServer and Lightning are now supported. And critically, the broadening of the donor base means that allegations of capture or co-option ring hollow. Gone are the days where Blockstream faced allegations of hoarding all the most influential developers.  See also: Nic Carter - After the Twitter Hack, We Need a User-Owned Internet More Than Ever  One imagines that the fundamental logic – firms that rely on Bitcoin should support development, not because it’s the right thing to do, but because it’s the economically rational thing to do – will eventually persuade even the most recalcitrant among them. At this point, large exchanges, custodians and brokers who resist giving back to the protocol which powers their businesses face a PR black eye.  For those versed in the dynamics of open source, Bitcoin’s patronage system as a funding model should come as no surprise. Bitcoin works in ways that are not short-term expedient, but pay dividends in the final analysis. Of course, a protocol-derived pool of rewards with which to pay developers would have been much more convenient, but it would have completely undermined the political neutrality of the monetary system.  Every now and again, critics bemoan the lack of a protocol-financed slush fund with which to pay for improvements and public goods. Such pools of capital, derived either through pre-mines or the ongoing diversion of block rewards, exist in Ethereum, XRP, EOS, Zcash, Dash and many other Bitcoin alternatives. But far from enhancing the prospects for these networks, these funds are a source of bickering, self-dealing and graft. They endow the protocol-proximate individuals who control the purse strings with total discretion to direct funds to allies and friends. Governance controls are generally weak and token holders lack the effective ability to monitor and police these expenditures.  When it comes to monetary neutrality, projects with protocol financing are no better than the deeply politicized USD.  These projects choose the unfortunate path of granting fiscal privileges to network administrators, effectively creating poorly-run bureaucracies. Corruption and malinvestment have been the predictable result. For networks aspiring to become critical financial infrastructure on a global scale, this constitutes a significant liability. When it comes to monetary neutrality, projects with protocol financing are no better than the deeply politicized U.S. dollar.  Even projects that do not currently expropriate validator revenue for development funds are not immune. The siren song of cheap money for development constantly rings in their ears. One notable example is Bitcoin Cash, which is currently embroiled in an ugly civil war over protocol financing.  Due to a paucity of developers on BCH, the most influential among them can effectively extort the community into granting them remuneration financed by the protocol itself. As such, major BCH stakeholders proposed an “Infrastructure Financing Plan” that would divert block rewards to a fund dedicated to development. This would constitute an effective redistribution from the already-questionable security budget towards a fund controlled by a small handful of individuals doled out to cronies.  Because BCH never developed a meaningful patronage system, token holders can now be shaken down to divert funds to certain developers. Even if this plan is rejected, the idea will linger. The only remedy is a stable patronage system. But no other public blockchains have Bitcoin’s combination of industry buy-in, accumulated credibility, and neutrality from inception, so the emergence of similar patronage models appears unlikely.  This is one of Bitcoin’s underappreciated advantages: by committing to a stable set of rules, Bitcoin has insulated itself from the expropriation of its supply for political expediency.",POSITIVE,BCH,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE,Nic Carter,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/08/06/bitcoins-patronage-system-is-an-unheralded-strength,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7affb845c6c7350dfc99a0b86460d7fca6f81d58-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432449,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNZllh,1596723934,TikTok and the Great Firewall of America,"Emily Parker is CoinDesk's Global Macro Editor.      On Wednesday, the Trump administration announced The Clean Network program, which is supposed to protect Americans’ private information from “malign actors,” namely China. The basic idea is that barring Chinese apps and companies will make America safe again. “Building a Clean fortress around our citizens’ data will ensure all of our nations’ security,” the State Department statement said.      This is similar to the language lawmakers are using against TikTok. “A U.S. company should buy TikTok so everyone can keep using it and your data is safe,” U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) recently tweeted. “This is about privacy.”      The argument is that the Chinese-owned app TikTok, which has access to the personal data of millions of Americans, could pose a threat to national security. Taken at face value, that position is not unreasonable. The problem is the assumption that U.S. companies can be trusted to keep personal data private and safe. This is not necessarily true.      See also: Money Reimagined: China’s ‘Cold War’ Blockchain Strategy      No, this isn’t ""whataboutism,"" or “America does bad things, too.” It’s simply to say we don’t even know for sure TikTok is mishandling personal data or surveilling ordinary citizens. We do know American companies are. So why aren’t more people talking about this national security threat?      Last week, President Trump threatened to ban TikTok in the U.S., raising the bizarre specter of a world in which teenagers jump over the Great Firewall of America to use a Chinese app. Trump walked this back a bit, saying the U.S. would shut down TikTok on Sept. 15 unless Microsoft or another “very American” company bought it. He also said that the U.S. government should get a cut of the sale.      Just for argument’s sake, let’s give the White House the benefit of the doubt and assume this isn’t election year China-bashing or old-fashioned protectionism. The idea of a foreign-owned company holding a honeypot of personal data on millions of Americans – data subject to a third-party hack or pressure from a government – is not a great scenario.    The problem is the assumption that U.S. companies can be trusted to keep personal data private and safe.    But American companies are also vulnerable to these threats. Last year the New York Times published a deep dive into how mostly unregulated companies use mobile phones to trace the movements of tens of millions of people – and also store that information.      “Within America’s own representative democracy, citizens would surely rise up in outrage if the government attempted to mandate that every person above the age of 12 carry a tracking device that revealed their location 24 hours a day,” the article noted. “Yet, in the decade since Apple’s App Store was created, Americans have, app by app, consented to just such a system run by private companies.""      The Times was also able to use that same data set to track, within minutes, the location of President Trump. If that’s not a national security issue, then what is? If journalists can use this kind of data to find a U.S. president, foreign spies could probably do the same.      ""Here we are freaking out about TikTok, when people's cell phone carriers are doing things that are frankly compromising our security in much graver ways,"" said Rebecca MacKinnon, founding director of Ranking Digital Rights, a research program at the think tank New America.      Nor is excessive data collection limited to cell phone companies. Google’s data hoarding is well known. It was not long ago that Facebook allowed the data firm Cambridge Analytica access to the private data of 50 million users.      In a widely viewed TED Talk from 2017, the academic Zeynep Tufekci reminded the world how Facebook tracks every status update, Messenger conversation and log-in location, not to mention all the information it purchases from data brokers. Her talk concluded with the plea: “We need a digital economy where our data and our attention is not for sale to the highest-bidding authoritarian or demagogue.”      In the case of TikTok, the fear is Beijing could demand data on American users, and TikTok owner ByteDance would have no choice but to hand it over. Especially at a moment of heightened U.S.-China tensions, many Americans would be uncomfortable with this, and understandably so.      But some of those same Americans probably wouldn’t want their own government keeping tabs on them either. Yet, the data stored by U.S. companies has facilitated precisely that situation. As the cryptologist Bruce Schneier wrote in his book, “Data and Goliath”:    The [National Security Agency] didn’t build a massive internet eavesdropping system from scratch. It noticed that the corporate world was already building one, and tapped into it ... [S]ometimes those corporations work with the NSA willingly. Sometimes they’re forced by the courts to hand over data, largely in secret.    Governments, of course, are only part of the problem. Non-state hackers can also wreak considerable havoc, as evidenced by the 17-year-old in Florida who allegedly broke into some of the most prominent Twitter accounts in the world. Stories of massive data breaches are becoming all too familiar. Researchers found 2019 to be the worst year on record, with almost 8 billion records exposed.      Data honeypots are dangerous, regardless of their nationality. Campaigners have proposed solutions, including breaking up the tech giants. Ranking Digital Rights recommends a federal privacy law that would include strong data-minimization and purpose-limitation provisions.      Ideally, ""collection, retention and data sharing could only happen with very explicit consent and opt-in by the user,"" MacKinnon said. ""But that is not the case. We have very lax legal protections for users about what is happening to our data.""      See also: Lex Sokolin - China’s Open Source Development Has Lessons for the US      ""Congress’ failure to pass a strong federal privacy law is a national security failure,"" MacKinnon added.      Another solution would be the popularization of decentralized social media platforms in which users control their own information. The idea is to store personal data on a distributed ledger rather than in a centralized entity like Facebook. This would, in theory, help address the honeypot problem. While this idea is often talked about in the blockchain and crypto community, we’re still some ways off from seeing a platform like this unseat the incumbent tech giants.      Now that data security is back in the headlines, it’s a good time to refocus on this issue. We can start with U.S. lawmakers acknowledging this problem is much bigger than TikTok and won’t be solved by simply putting more data in the hands of U.S. companies.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | WALLET | RESEARCH,Emily Parker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/08/06/tiktok-and-the-great-firewall-of-america,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2d298ae85836e02d87b2b283233d7e6f2d11ea8c-1700x1145.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The blockchain system is designed for trade finance transactions, including exchanging letters of credit, the bank's press representative told CoinDesk Thursday.      Anatoly Popov, Sberbank’s deputy chair, told the Russian newspaper Vedomosti on Wednesday the bank is also planning to launch its own stablecoin, pegged to the price of the ruble, that could be used to buy digital assets.      However, Sberbank’s press office told CoinDesk there is no concrete plan for the stablecoin yet. The bank is waiting for a new digital assets law to come into force in January 2021, and after that will talk to its partners and make the final decision.      Russian President Vladimir Putin signed the first of two bills on digital assets into law on July 31.      A stablecoin would be a logical component of the blockchain platform for faster payments and settlements, which Sberbank is planning to launch during Q3.      Read also: ‘Disappointed’ by Central Bank Blockchain, Russia’s Largest Bank Eyes Alternatives      The system is built on Hyperledger's Fabric blockchain framework, with nodes hosted in Sberbank’s own cloud computing service, SberCloud. According to Sberbank, the system will be open, so any firm would be able to join and set up its own node.      “Any company will be able to use smart contracts created by Sberbank right away or create their own,” Popov told CoinDesk through the press representative. “Payments via smart contracts go through automatically and the vendors receive funds in a matter of seconds.""      Trade finance is just one potential use case for the platform. Sberbank is planning to put a number of its existing services on its blockchain as well.

The Ethereum-based hybrid exchange said Thursday the $2.5 million would go to launching IDEX 2.0, a new, more liquid platform.  The money came in a seed round led by G1 Ventures and Borderless Capital, with other commits from Collider Ventures and Gnosis.  IDEX's creator, Panama-based Aurora Labs, raised $6 million in an initial coin offering (ICO) in early 2018.  Market makers and algorithmic traders (a prominent subset being high-frequency traders, or HFTs) will be able use the new exchange. They have previously been shut out because of high transaction costs.  In a statement, the exchange said this new group of traders will tighten spreads, making IDEX cheaper and more seamless for its users.  HFTs use powerful computers to process thousands of transactions in fractions of a second, earning revenue from exploiting minuscule disparities in listed prices. They are controversial: some allege they manipulate markets, but advocates say they improve liquidity and market performance.  IDEX is a hybrid exchange in that settlement and storage are decentralized, while trade executions and deposits are processed centrally. This makes it fast enough to be usable while offering the security of a fully decentralized exchange.  The hybrid aspect of IDEX's design will remain unchanged with the IDEX 2.0 launch, expected in the next few weeks.

The funds will be used for further development of blockchain games including the eventual launch of NBA Top Shot out of private beta, Dapper Labs founder and CEO Roham Gharegozlou told CoinDesk in a phone interview.      “Sports are our most important vertical now,” Gharegozlou said.

Dapper Labs has raised $51 million to date in seven rounds, according to Crunchbase.    NBA Top Shot    As first reported by The Block, NBA Top Shot broke $1.2 million in revenue three months after Beta trial launch. The app allows basketball fans to purchase officially licensed digital tokens of NBA player rosters similar to a trading-card game.      “Flow can create the vehicle for consumers to enter the space through products like NBA Top Shot where they have fun, but at the same time create a new self-sovereignty,” Dinwiddie said in a statement.

42432454,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNZlzh,1596717084,"Bitcoin Entering 'New Adoption Cycle,' Coin Metrics Exec Says","Bitcoin user adoption looks to be gathering pace as its price rises amid a coronavirus-induced rush for assets with safe-haven appeal.    The number of bitcoin addresses holding at least $10-worth of cryptocurrency recently rose to a record high of 16.6 million, according to data source Coin Metrics  That number is now up 14% from the previous peak of 14.5 million reached in January 2018, soon after the cryptocurrency's all-time price high of $20,000.  Essentially, there are now more addresses with a small balance than were seen at the height of the previous bull market.  The data suggests ""a new bitcoin adoption cycle is brewing,” according to Lucas Nuzzi, network data product manager at crypto data provider Coin Metrics.  Address growth is not a precise indicator of bitcoin's user base because a single individual or entity can hold multiple addresses.  Adoption has gone up by 27% in the 4.5 months since the major crash in mid-March.  Bitcoin’s price has rallied by over 200% during the same period, and is up 64% year to date.  Relatively scarce assets like bitcoin and gold seem to have benefited from fears of a dwindling U.S. dollar and the inflation-boosting policies of central banks and governments.  Looking ahead  Some analysts expect bitcoin’s price to challenge record highs by the end of December.  Continued price gains could have an exponential effect on user growth as FOMO (fear of missing out) hits consumers.  Bitcoin may have a tough time scaling $12,000 in the short run if traders and crypto miners take advantage of the recent price rise and liquidate holdings.  As per Chainalysis Market Intel, 230,000 BTC (worth around $2.6 billion) with an on-paper profit of 25% or more were sent to exchanges last week.  It's not known whether, or how many of, these coins were liquidated during Sunday’s sell-off.  Bitcoin is trading near $11,700 at press time, representing a 0.5% drop on the day.

OKCoin is awarding Falke an Independent Developer Grant, which is the ""equivalent of a developer salary for the year,"" though Falke requested that the exact amount not be disclosed for the sake of his financial privacy.      Read more: OKCoin, BitMEX Sponsor Bitcoin Core Developer Amiti Uttarwar      With his grant, Falke will continue his work as maintainer of Bitcoin Core, the key software underpinning Bitcoin, which he's been heads-down on since 2016. His work helps to ensure that changes to Bitcoin Core are merged, helps to organize developers that are spread out over the globe, and runs tests to ensure the code is working properly, among other tasks.      When asked about his personal accomplishments, Falke emphasized that Bitcoin Core is a team effort, with developers from around the world making it what it is. ""I am proud to see what Bitcoin Core is today and how everyone's contributions shaped Bitcoin Core for the future,"" Falke told CoinDesk.    'Maintenance' work    Falke is one of a handful of Bitcoin Core maintainers. Maintainers are sometimes described as the leaders of sorts of Bitcoin's code. But, while maintainers are crucial to Bitcoin, the role isn't as authoritative as has been painted.      ""Some of my days are surprisingly unexciting maintenance work,"" as Falke put it.      Testing ensures code works as intended. He spends a lot of time keeping tests of the code in line, ensuring that any issues they expose will be fixed. ""On top of that, I am running my own nightly test runs, code coverage runs, benchmarks and fuzzers,"" Falke said.      In addition, he reviews proposed code changes and merges them into Bitcoin Core ""when they have been sufficiently vetted.""      Read more: Hard Fork vs Soft Fork      Helping to speed up this maintenance process is what he believes is his ""most useful"" contribution to Bitcoin Core.    DrahtBot    He created a little bot for GitHub, where Bitcoin Core's code is stored, and where developers propose code changes, and discuss them. The bot, called DrahtBot, ""does all the automatable things that I used to do,"" Falke said.      Many Bitcoin Core developers are working on the code at the same time. It's easy for little code clashes to arise. Once a change is approved and ""merged"" into the code base, it might impact other people's code. DrahtBot notifies developers of these conflicts. ""The bot will also list all future conflicts, assuming a pull request was merged, to aid maintainers planning ahead,"" Falke added.      DrahtBot also ""builds"" the Bitcoin Core code into binaries that bitcoiners can run on their devices, among other tasks.      This bot frees up ""a lot more"" time for Falke to focus on other more difficult tasks, which can't be automated and taken over by a robot.    Fleeing COVID-19    One reason Falke is happy to be receiving this grant is that he is leaving Chaincode, a startup in New York City that funds developers and researchers dedicated to improving Bitcoin.      He decided to move back to his farm in Germany. ""Given that I grew up on a remote farm, away from big cities, NYC was definitely a new, lasting and exciting experience. Nonetheless, I couldn't see myself settle down in NYC long-term,"" Falke said.      Then, coronavirus hit, making New York City an even less attractive place to live for Falke.      ""Even before COVID, I saw many of my friends and colleagues leave NYC. Then with the COVID situation happening, and seeing politics and immigration policy becoming increasingly hostile towards immigrants and visa holders, it convinced me to move back to Germany,"" he said.      Read more: Here’s How to Expand Who Contributes to Bitcoin Core      Chaincode only employs people who live in New York City. When Falke decided to depart, Chaincode’s head of special projects Adam Jonas helped him find new funding at OKCoin.      ""I'd like to thank Adam Jonas from Chaincode for reaching out to various companies in the space and showing them the importance of supporting Bitcoin developers,"" Falke said.    OKCoin: Funding Bitcoin Development    With a global health crisis that's far from over and a feeble world economy, 2020 has been a disaster of a year. The sliver of a silver lining, though, is that 2020 has been the best ever in terms of funding developers tinkering to make bitcoin better after a long dearth of funding.

Many open source Bitcoin developers work on the code as a side project, essentially improving the digital currency for free, despite their contributions helping everyone in the industry, including the companies profiting from it. But now, more exchanges and other bitcoin organizations are beginning to support this work financially.

42432467,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNZm7h,1596713116,First Mover: Bitcoin Rises More in One Day Than Stocks Have Gained All Year,"Bitcoin prices surged 5% on Wednesday, outpacing stocks and gold amid calls for more government stimulus, as the economic toll of the coronavirus mounts.      The oldest and largest cryptocurrency rose to $11,755. The price is now approaching $12,000 for the second time in a week, a level that bitcoin hasn't sustainably traded above for more than a year.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      Bloomberg News went so far as to declare in an article Wednesday that ""bitcoin mania appears to be almost back in full bloom.""      Bitcoin is seen by many digital-asset investors as a hedge against inflation, and the bets are growing that governments and central banks will have to pump trillions of dollars more into the financial system to stimulate the economy out of the worst recession since the 1930s.      Gold, historically seen as a reliable inflation hedge, surged this week to a new record above $2,000.      Yet, even gold's 35% gain this year is no match for bitcoin's 63% price increase. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index is now up 3% on the year, with some traditional investors arguing that stocks have become detached from reality, merely propped up by the roughly $3 trillion of freshly created money that the Federal Reserve has pumped into the global financial system this year.      ""Bitcoin and the crypto markets are once again able to claim independence from the traditional markets,"" Mati Greenspan, co-founder of the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency analysis firm Quantum Economics, wrote Wednesday in a newsletter.      The U.S. government's budget deficit this fiscal year is projected to soar to $3.7 trillion, far surpassing the previous record of $1.4 trillion in 2009, according to the Associated Press.      An extra $600-per-week federal benefit for laid-off workers lapsed last week, threatening the economic recovery, and U.S. lawmakers are wrangling over the details of a new spending measure that could range from $1 trillion to more than $3 trillion.      ""Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition as a hedge against fiat currency debasement only grows stronger,"" Anil Lulla, of cryptocurrency research firm Delphi Digital, noted Wednesday in an op-ed for CoinDesk.      The International Monetary Fund warned this week in a blog post that ""another bout of global financial stress could trigger more capital flow reversals, currency pressures and further raise the risk of an external crisis for economies with preexisting vulnerabilities, such as large current account deficits.""      All that just plays to bitcoin's strengths, as more investors start to extrapolate the likely stimulus needed to recover from a protracted economic downturn. According Bloomberg News, analysts for the U.S. bank JPMorgan wrote Tuesday that while older investors are buying gold, younger investors are buying bitcoin.      The analysis firm Coin Metrics noted that over the past week bitcoin had averaged over 1 million daily active addresses for the first time since January 2018. That was in the wake of the cryptocurrency hitting an all-time high around $20,000 in 2017.      And Norwegian cryptocurrency-analysis firm Arcane Research noted in a report this week that bitcoin daily trading volumes have been ""growing strongly,"" with several days topping $2 billion. The number of open bitcoin futures contracts on the CME exchange has jumped to a new record around $850 million.      ""The strong momentum in the market continues,"" Arcane wrote. ""The sharp rise in open interest at CME is a clear indication of increased institutional demand for bitcoin.""      Chris Thomas, head of digital assets for broker Swissquote, told CoinDesk's Daniel Cawrey on Wednesday that bitcoin could break past $12,000 by Friday.      The signs certainly appear to be pointing in that direction.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $11,700 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $11,807 | 24-Hr Low: $11,380      Trend: Bitcoin is looking north after twin bullish cues were activated by a 5% rally Wednesday.      Firstly, with the UTC close at $11,755, bitcoin marked an upside break of a narrowing price range witnessed Monday and Tuesday.      In addition, Wednesday’s UTC close established a strong foothold above $11,400. The bulls had repeatedly failed to keep gains above that level on Monday and Tuesday.      The combination of range breakout and convincing move above a key hurdle has opened the doors for a re-test of recent highs above $12,100.

Earlier this week in New York, U.S. District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan said a class-action lawsuit for five investors showed a distinct lack of diligence and commitment that made them unsuitable to become the lead plaintiff in the Block.one lawsuit.  Known as the ""Williams Group,"" Judge Kaplan said the plaintiffs had submitted incomplete, inaccurate and unsubstantiated trading data that failed to show how much money they lost from investing in the EOS initial coin offering (ICO).  For example, trading data submitted from one of the plaintiffs shows he allegedly sold more than 3,000 eos tokens than he had actually bought.  Judge Kaplan added that Token Fund I, one of the plaintiffs, failed to provide evidence of trading losses and was only set up two days before it filed a motion to become lead plaintiff, suggesting it was created as a vehicle specially for this lawsuit.  A decision to remove a couple of plaintiffs at the last minute ""raises further concerns that the application is being driven by the lawyers, rather than the plaintiffs,"" Judge Kaplan added.  The lead plaintiff's case represents all other plaintiffs with similar suits and is the only one that goes to court, meaning the lead plaintiff's lawyers pick up the legal fees.  In the Block.one case, which alleges the EOS creator committed securities fraud, Judge Kaplan said it was possible the suit could stretch on for many years, making it a lucrative prospect for the lead plaintiff's legal team.  Instead of the Williams Group, Judge Kaplan chose the lawsuit from the Crypto Assets Opportunity Fund (CAOF), which was filed in May, as lead plaintiff, saying the fund had a bigger financial interest and had actually supplied accurate and evidenced trading data.

Court documents are typically served via mail or delivered in person to defendants, but plaintiffs bringing the case against Switzerland-based Status filed a motion Monday asking the court to allow its top executives to be served through the firm’s attorneys, or via email and social media accounts.  Status CEO Jarrad Hope and Chief Communications Officer Carl Bennetts were named as individual defendants in the class-action lawsuit filed in April.  The suit alleges the $100 million raised in its initial coin offering (ICO) through the sale of Status’ native SNT token in 2017 was an unregistered securities sale and demands a trial by jury.  According to Monday’s motion, plaintiff’s counsel undertook “exhaustive efforts” to locate Hope and Bennetts who are supposedly residing in Switzerland.  They were, however, unsuccessful in retrieving an address for either executive, despite expending resources searching through social media, registries and even employing a private investigator.  The letter also specified an attempt to serve them through the 1965 Hague Convention, on the service of judicial documents abroad. This effort fell through because the defendants’ addresses were unknown.  The motion alleges Status executives have been avoiding being served, after attorneys for the plaintiffs attempted to serve the executives through Status' counsel.  “Indeed, Mr. Nagy, counsel for Status, has represented that he spoke to one of the Individual Defendants by phone about accepting service in this suit, but this individual did not authorize Mr. Nagy to accept service on his behalf,” the motion said.  The lawsuit against Status is one of a number of token offerings accused of violating the U.S. federal and state security laws, with the Securities and Exchange Commission taking two messaging apps (Telegram and Kik) to court over similar allegations in the last year.  The plaintiffs will now await a court order approving alternative means of service to let the suit proceed.

For example, there are more than 1.3 million Instagram posts using #Coinbase, an overwhelming number of which display inauthentic behavior. Coinbase declined to comment on any past influencer campaigns, with the short statement: “We don't have an active influencer campaign right now.” Instagram isn’t tackled specifically in the company’s blog post about social media scams.      Efforts to curtail this trend sometimes harm entrepreneurs like influencer and educator Rachel Siegel, better known as Crypto Finally. She was temporarily de-platformed from Instagram in July. For several days she was among at least three real crypto influencers, all young women, who temporarily lost access to their accounts.      “I think that the policies for banning over impersonation should be looked at, there are dozens of fake accounts impersonating me that are kept up on Instagram,” Siegel said. “I'm glad that they were able to reinstate my account, but I believe new preventative measures should be taken to protect their users from falling victim to scams and impersonators. Banning the original creator just makes the problem worse.”      Along with Siegel, the Argentinian influencer Catalina was also suspended. Instagram spokesperson Raki Wane told CoinDesk, “The accounts were taken down unintentionally, when the mistake was discovered we overturned.”      Read more: Your Property Rights Should Extend to Social Media      To be fair to Instagram, it’s clear COVID-19 fraud trends are outpacing current moderation practices.

There are many authentic influencer accounts doing giveaways on Instagram as part of their COVID-19 marketing strategies.      Despite this climate, Instagram still does provide an important networking platform for the crypto industry. Especially in Latin America, some entrepreneurs rely on Instagram to communicate with customers about their products.      Brazilian entrepreneur Edmilson Rodrigues, of both Bonnum and Lovecryptonet, often serves Venezuelan refugees who rely on mobile apps for communication. He said he uses Instagram to both “show pictures of my family and to publish updates about our product.” He said he interacts with product users via Instagram at least once every few weeks, especially when his startup launches a new feature.    Insta-Brazil    Yet another crypto company operating in Brazil, the Abakus Group-supported exchange Novadax, shows how startups leverage Instagram for customer relations during COVID-19.      Chinese investor turned Novadax CEO Beibei Liu said thousands of Brazilians used her exchange to buy bitcoin for the first time over the past few months. Out of roughly 150,000 user total accounts, she said surveys indicated 20% were new to crypto.      “We do a lot of basic educational content on Instagram,” Liu said, adding they also do Instagram Live sessions to answer user questions. “Instagram is a very important channel in Brazil, it’s a large population that is pretty young.”      Read more: Crypto Influencers Are Following the Beauty Playbook – Even if They Don’t Know It      More than half of the exchange’s Brazillian users are mobile-only, Liu said, so mobile-friendly customer support options are crucial. Even for the minority of professional traders using the platform, such as Portugese-speaking liquidity providers in Europe or the United States, Instagram marketing helps the startup establish trust.      “They are more skeptical, they have concerns. So we post a lot of things related to our company background and team background,” Liu said about how the startup uses Instagram for customer relations with experienced traders. “It shows we are a trustworthy company. We show that we continue to update our products.”      Indeed, the company is officially opening support for European traders in August, after months of limited onboarding, to help boost liquidity and create a complementary flow between institutions and the emerging retail market. This is why authenticity on social media platforms like Instagram, which is so difficult for moderators to safeguard, is a key factor influencing cryptocurrency adoption patterns.      Speaking to the global dynamics of Crypto Instagram, where some users struggle to identify authentic accounts, Siegel said she hopes Instagram “will create a new model for a more active effort to protect their users.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/08/06/crypto-instagram-is-becoming-a-thing-scams-and-all,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a34b3e2763fc93b65caa2095e384dfd84d0cf337-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404893,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAe8QZg,1596700235,Bitmain Delays Bitcoin Miner Shipments by Three Months as Co-Founders Battle On,"The escalating internal power struggle at Bitmain is starting to have a more serious impact on its business and customers.    The Beijing-based bitcoin miner maker said via the official WeChat account of its AntMiner brand Thursday that customers whose equipment were due in June and July will have to wait until September and October.  The delay is caused by ""external interference over the company's management,"" the official account said.  It's important to note that bitcoin miners are typically sold via pre-orders, which must be made two to three months in advance.  That means customers who ordered the June and July batches could have placed their orders as early as March and April.  The delay comes amid the escalating fight for control of Bitmain between its two co-founders, Wu Jihan and Micree Zhan Ketuan, which has essentially ""hard-forked"" the firm's bitcoin miner production.  Currently, the official WeChat account of the AntMiner brand is controlled by Wu's faction within the firm.  Zhan was ousted by Wu in October, but returned to power in June and has controlled Bitmain’s Shenzhen-based factory since then.  The situation threatens to become a kind of stalemate: Zhan's side will likely not have an easier time with shipments either, as Wu also controls the miner chip supply chain via Beijing Bitmain's parent entity in Hong Kong.  Bitmain is now offering two mutually exclusive options for customers whose orders are delayed.  The first option is to send Bitmain a written request to speed up the delivery. If they still don't receive their machines 60 days after the notice, they can request a refund.  The second is to wait patiently until the actual delivery, with Bitmain saying it will compensate customers with their theoretical mining revenue between now and delivery in the form of cash coupons to be used in future purchases.

42404895,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAe8QYh,1596690615,Ethereum Classic Suffers Second 51% Attack in a Week,"Ethereum Classic has suffered its second 51% attack in a week after more than 4,000 blocks were reorganized Thursday morning.      Mining pool Ethermine’s parent entity Bitfly and crypto exchange Binance reported the reorganization, announcing all Ethereum Classic payouts, withdrawals and deposits had been suspended due to the attack.      The reorganized transaction history is currently the longest chain on the network. However, the majority of Ethereum Classic miners – such as mining pool Ethermine – are continuing to mine on the shorter version of the network.      Developers behind Ethereum Classic said in a tweet minutes before Bitfly’s report that exchanges and mining pools are advised to “significantly raise confirmation times on all deposits and incoming transactions” in light of “recent network attacks.”      A chain reorg occurs when a party gains more hashing power than the rest of the network miners. The adversary can then rewrite the chain's history and “double-spend” the blockchain’s native currency (in this case, ETC). Hashing power on Ethereum Classic looks to have decreased considerably since Monday, August 3 dropping nearly 20% from 1.6 TH/s to 1.3 TH/s as of press time.      Read more: Ethereum Classic Suffers Reorganization That Resembles 51% Attack Amid Miner Complications      This fresh attack to Ethereum Classic’s network follows on from a recent attack that occurred between July 29 and Aug. 1, according to blockchain analytics firm Bitquery.      While Ethereum Classic developers initially said the network did not suffer from a reorganization or a 51% attack in that previous attack, Bitquery said Wednesday that an attacker double-spent a little over 800,000 ETC (about $5.6 million), and paid about 17.5 BTC ($204,000) to acquire the hash power for the attack.      The monetary value of Thursday’s 51% attack in terms of the double spends is not yet known. However, at $23.44 per block reward on Ethereum Classic, the attacker has most likely earned $93,760 from block rewards alone.      The attack follows the deprecation of the OpenEthereum client on July 16. Nearly half of the network’s nodes – including important mining and exchange connections – operated on OpenEthereum software which became immediately outdated following the first chain reorg on July 31.      Ethereum Classic developers have urged node operators to switch to Besu or Core-geth implementations as soon as possible.      Ethereum Classic’s price was $7.03 as of press time, down less than 1% over 24 hours.    Not the first    The network has suffered major reorg attacks at least twice in the last two years.      In the more recent attack, the perpetrator moved more than 807,000 ETC from an unspecified crypto exchange to several wallets between July 29-31, according to Bitquery.      The attacker then started mining blocks after purchasing the hash power from a user on cryptocurrency mining platform Nicehash.      On July 31, the attacker sent money to their own wallet address via private transactions and then implemented the transactions into the blocks they were mining.      The attacker then sent back money to a crypto exchange, which Bitquery alleges belongs to Malta-based OKEx.      By August 1 the attacker published their blocks and initiated the chain reorg.      As of press time, none of the funds compromised in the 51% attack have moved from the OKEx exchange, according to Bitquery.
