42420633,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqPXx,1683069053,"Bitcoin Climbs Above $28.5K as Investors Weigh Fresh Bank Woes, Cool Jobs Data","Bitcoin (BTC) rose during U.S. trading hours on Tuesday as investors contemplated the latest banking unrest and seemed to regain interest in crypto and other assets that hold value.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at around $28,775, up roughly 2.6% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data. BTC’s price had hovered around $28,000 for most of the past day before jumping early Tuesday after shares of two regional banks, Los Angeles-based PacWest Bancorp (PACW) and Phoenix-based Western Alliance Bank (WAL), tumbled 27% and 15%, respectively. Meanwhile, the latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) arrived weaker than expected.  The failure of four U.S. banks, including First Republic earlier this week, has buffeted the economy but seemed to buoy crypto prices. The cool jobs data suggested that the economy was weakening and that inflationary pressures might subside, another potential boon to digital assets.  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, also edged higher, by 2.5%, to change hands at around $1,877. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which measures the overall crypto market performance, was up over 2% for the day.  Equities headed south during Tuesday's closing, with the S&P 500 trading down 1.1%. Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped roughly 1%.  In bond markets, the yield on the two-year Treasury note – a gauge of near-term interest rate expectations – fell 16 basis points to sit around 3.94%. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note also fell, by roughly 14 basis points to 3.42%.  An April survey of 37 investors by CoinShares found that 64% believe the Federal Reserve has made a policy error, with another 22% saying “not yet,” implying that it is “quite possible the Fed may make a mistake in the near future,” according to CoinShares.  The study also found that despite a flurry of regulatory actions during the first quarter of the year, digital asset weighting in portfolios has risen to around 1.6%, up from 0.7% in October.  Ether remains the favored asset, a finding little changed from the last survey in January. “This is encouraging, having endured uncertainty surrounding the [Ethereum blockchain's] Shapella upgrade,"" CoinShares said.  Meanwhile, funding managers believe that BTC and ETH offer the most compelling growth outlook, with less of an appetite for altcoins, the survey said.  “Should the economy weaken further (risk-off) this would hurt ETH, causing ETH to underperform to the downside,” Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at crypto analytics firm Amberdata, noted in a recent newsletter. “A recession would cause the Fed to pivot and cut rates later this year (good for gold and BTC).”  Magadini said BTC should continue to outperform and increase market share.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/02/bitcoin-climbs-above-285k-as-investors-weigh-fresh-bank-woes-cool-jobs-data,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e7c87cbcec01b49e92f12f42ef3be2e2bcf4ce23-1132x564.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

12303357,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=529491,1683068428,Is Meme Coin Season Back? Here’s What The Numbers Say,"Meme coins are rallying once more with 1,000% increases in a matter of hours now becoming the order of the day. With so many new meme coins performing well in the market, it is starting to look like a repeat of the infamous 2021 meme coin season. However, unlike in 2021, a whole new set of tokens are leading the charge this time around. Pepe Coin (PEPE) Triggers New Meme Run Before Pepe Coin (PEPE) launched in mid-April, meme coins had become another fixture in the market, just moving along with the general crypto market trend. However, PEPE would rise from a $50,000 market cap to over $600 million in less than three weeks and what followed was euphoria that triggered another meme coin bull run. Since PEPE’s success, a number of other meme coins have entered the market and many have found success as well across multiple chains. An example of this is the AIDOGE meme coin that launched on the Arbitrum blockchain around the same time as PEPE and in the two weeks that followed, the price of the cryptocurrency rose over 100x. Related Reading: Ripple’s Q1 Report Shows That Investors Are Still Bullish On XRP, Here’s Why Following the performance of both of these meme coins, activity spiked significantly on both blockchains with new coins entering the market. The next two weeks saw the entrance of new players such as WOJAK and SHIBAI, both of which have been listed on multiple centralized exchanges as well. Ethereum’s decentralized exchange trading volume is now dominated by these new meme coins, as well as the newly listed token pages on both on-chain data aggregators Coinmarketcap and CoinGecko. OG Meme Coins Take A Back Seat While it seems the meme season is back in full bloom, the original meme coins are not enjoying any of the action. Instead, cryptocurrencies such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are still seeing losses during a time when these new meme coins are performing incredibly well. For example, DOGE is changing hands at a price of $0.07822 at the time of this writing, with 24-hour losses of 0.84% and 7-day losses of 0.08%. In the same vein, SHIB is down 1.28% in the last day to be trading at $0.000009875. It has performed even worse on the weekly timeframe with a drawdown of 2.97%. DOGE seeing losses on the 24-hour chart | Source: DOGEUSD on TradingView.com Obviously, investors are looking toward newer meme tokens in a bid to catch the next 100x, and coins like DOGE and SHIB have already grown too much to give such returns. Hence the reason why new meme coins are getting all of the attention right now. Related Reading: Kaspa (KAS), Render (RNDR), Injective (INJ) See Upside Amid Market Crash, What’s Going On?

42420614,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqPYz,1683064698,White House Pushes for Punitive Tax on Crypto Mining,"U.S. President Joe Biden is looking to impose a punitive tax on crypto mining operations for the “harms they impose on society,” the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) said Tuesday in an online post.  The administration’s blog entry made the case for a U.S. tax equal to 30% of a mining firm’s energy costs – an unusual industry-specific penalty that could threaten the profits of such businesses.  “Currently, crypto mining firms do not have to pay for the full cost they impose on others, in the form of local environmental pollution, higher energy prices, and the impacts of increased greenhouse gas emissions on the climate,” according to the CEA’s description of the levy it calls the Digital Asset Mining Energy tax.  While other energy-intensive industries wouldn’t be similarly saddled with the new tax, the CEA contends that “crypto mining does not generate the local and national economic benefits typically associated with businesses using similar amounts of electricity.”  The Biden administration first proposed the excise tax in a March 9 document published by the U.S. Treasury Department. The so-called Greenbook lays out the administration's proposals and priorities for generating revenue over the next year, but such proposals often fail to survive the process as Congress finalizes the nation’s spending plans.  The tax could raise up to $3.5 billion in revenue over the next 10 years, the post said.  Some of the largest U.S. mining firms include Riot Platforms (RIOT), Marathon Digital (MARA), Cipher Mining (CIFR), Greenidge Generation (GREE), BitDeer (BTDR) and CleanSpark (CLSK).  The administration's Council of Economic Advisors also published a report in March detailing its wider concerns with the industry, and it highlighted the possible economic effects of mining as one such issue. These concerns include possible pollution and the cost to local communities of having mining firms move in. Even mining firms that use clean energy might raise the overall energy costs and usage of the community around them, the post said.  Congressional Republicans have resisted efforts from regulators and the administration to penalize the crypto sector, so the Republican-controlled House of Representatives may not be likely to embrace taxes that punish the industry.

The former chief technology officer at crypto exchange Coinbase and a former partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, Srinivasan in mid-March – shortly after the failures in short order of Silvergate Bank, Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank – said he expected a banking crisis to trigger a sizable devaluation of the U.S. dollar, hyperinflation and a surge in bitcoin to $1 million by mid-June. He put up $1 million to back his prediction.  ""I just burned a million to tell you they're printing trillions,"" he tweeted Tuesday afternoon. ""I spent my own money to send a provably costly signal that there’s something wrong with the economy, and that it's not going to be a 'soft landing' like [Federal Reserve Chair Jerome] Powell promises – but something much worse.""  He noted that current U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen was at the Federal Reserve ahead of the 2008 global financial crisis and failed to sound any alarms, nor did the then-chairman of the Fed, Ben Bernanke. Today's crop of leaders, Powell among them, are similarly in denial, argued Srinivasan.  Crises, he reminded, can move far more quickly than anyone imagines. Srinivasan claimed that it took two days for the Fed to print $300 billion following the Silicon Valley Bank failure, two weeks for $500 billion to leave the banking system, two months to go from ""patient zero"" to national lockdown during COVID-19, two quarters to go from mild recession to financial crisis in 2008 and two years for the Soviet Union to go from superpower to collapse in 1991.  Others have a different interpretation of the $300 million growth in the Fed's balance sheet post-Silicon Valley Bank. Economist and former Fed staffer Danielle DiMartino Booth argued at the time that the quick jump was not money printing, but instead a surge in Federal Reserve discount window and other borrowings by the nation's banks.  In closing out his $1 million bet, Srinivasan made three $500,000 donations, one to fund Bitcoin Core development at Chaincode Labs, one to Give Directly and one to pseudonymous Twitter user James Medlock, who back in March offered to bet $1 million that the U.S. would not experience hyperinflation.

42420625,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqPkL,1683061222,"Bitcoin, Ether Rise Sharply Immediately Following JOLTS Jobs Data","Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) responded positively following Tuesday’s Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) data, each increasing close to 2% during the hour of release.  The report showed that job openings in the United States declined to 9.6 million in March, below expectations of 9.775 million, and their lowest level since April 2021.  Crypto market observers have recently considered weakening jobs data as positive for asset prices because:  The Federal Reserve will continue to raise interest rates until it feels comfortable inflation has calmed.  Interest rate increases are a negative for asset prices (crypto included).  Labor markets must cool for inflation to decline.  In short, “bad” employment data is “good” for markets, at least in the current environment.  In general, pinning price increases and decreases to macroeconomic reports with 100% certainty is difficult. But the timing of Tuesday’s spikes in bitcoin’s price and volume suggests strongly that BTC responded to the jobs report. Prices moderated throughout the remainder of the day following the initial move higher.  Crypto markets may also be making an early move ahead of Wednesday’s more highly publicized U.S. central bank interest rate decision, although the expected 25 basis point increase is likely already priced in.  One curious development is that other risk assets, most notably equities, did not react similarly to the jobs data. The S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), each declined following the data release.  Correlations between crypto and equities have weakened this year, with a once-strong correlation of 0.80 between BTC and the S&P 500 declining to a relatively benign current correlation of 0.27.  On-chain metrics indicate that markets may be quiet over the next couple of days, as the Federal Reserve mulls its rate decision. Exchange balances for both BTC and ETH remain close to where they stood at the beginning of 2023.  BTC and ETH balances on crypto exchanges often increase when investors are preparing to reduce their positions in the asset. The relative lack of movement following respective 73% and 56% year-to-date increases implies that investors are continuing to hold, even in the face of higher prices.

The less than one-month-old meme token has nothing at all to do with Bitcoin, yet shockingly is displaying nearly exact price patterns. Don’t miss this incredible and unusual chart comparison between BTCUSD and PEPEUSDC. A Quick Recap Of Pepe Coin And Its Runaway Crypto Success Pepe coin is one of the biggest new meme coins, prompting a massive wave of more meme tokens of all kinds. If you couldn’t tell by the name, much like Dogecoin is associated with the Doge meme, this one features the Matt Furie-created Pepe the Frog. Related Reading: Can Meme Coin PEPE Get Into The Top 100? Read This Before Buying Anyone who invested in Pepe coin over the last couple of weeks “feels good, man.” That is because it has risen in value by over 2,500% in 14 days — numbers that are high even by crypto standards. Most of the supply of holders at this point is in substantial profit. But if the Bitcoin chart is any indication of what’s to come, some serious profit taking could be ahead. In the comparison below, we have put the 4-hour PEPEUSDC chart up against the weekly BTCUSD chart. The left chart features two weeks of price action, while the chart on the right shows four full years. Yet they are extremely similar. Bitcoin versus the frog king of the memes | PEPEUSDC on TradingView.com The Unusual Bitcoin Comparison Explained According to study of Elliott Wave Principle, markets are fractal and form self-similar, repeating patterns across various degrees of timeframes. Simply put, the same price action and behavior can appear on an hourly or 4H chart as it does on a much higher timeframe. Related Reading: Sad Frogs: Why The Parabolic Pepe Coin Could Flatten By 80% The study focuses on mass crowd behavior and human psychology, particularly how it can create clearly definable turning points in financial markets. The two charts looking and behaving so similarly could be due to the same type of speculative behavior. Importantly, if the comparison is accurate for the reasons discussed, it could indicate that Pepe coin is due for some profit-taking and a correction soon enough. Of course, the meme coin could be nowhere near done and anyone who sells now could be a very, very sad frog. Did you buy Pepe? Tell us on Twitter. Did you buy #PEPE?

The collapse of First Republic Bank, the largest U.S. bank failure since 2008, has sent shockwaves through the financial sector, prompting experts to warn that a “confidence crisis” could happen to any bank in the country. Investors have reacted quickly to the news, with shares of PacWest Bancorp, Western Alliance Bank, and KeyCorp plummeting by as much as 30%, 21%, and 10%, respectively. The KBW Regional Banking Index has also taken a hit, falling by 5.2% and its lowest since December 2020. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) Climbs Higher: Q1 2023 Results Show Impressive Growth US Banking Industry In Peril, Half Of America’s Banks Nearing Insolvency Mario Nawfal, a renowned financial expert, has expressed concern over the recent plummeting of bank shares in major U.S. regional banks, signaling a deepening banking crisis in the country. In the aftermath of the collapse of First Republic Bank, the largest U.S. bank failure since the 2008 financial crisis, shares of PacWest Bancorp, Western Alliance Bank, and KeyCorp fell drastically, with the KBW Regional Banking Index hitting their lowest level since December 2020. Nawfal warns that if a confidence crisis can happen to the First Republic, it can happen to any bank in the country. He attributes the current state of the US banking industry to “insatiable greed and reckless” money printing, which have had dire consequences. The collapse of First Republic Bank is just the tip of the iceberg, and things could get much worse if the Federal Reserve doesn’t pivot, Nawfal claimed. The implications of JPMorgan being the government’s first line of defense in a banking crisis are also a cause of concern for analysts from Evercore ISI, a global independent investment banking advisory firm. Nawfal further stated that the US banking industry is in peril, and urgent measures must be taken to prevent a complete collapse. Major US Banks Experience Significant Share Price Falls, Halting Trading PacWest Bancorp and Western Alliance Bancorp, two major players in the US banking industry, have halted trading in their equities after experiencing significant share price falls of 24% and 20%, respectively. This follows the recent sale of First Republic Bank to JPMorgan, which occurred after the US regulator, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), took control of the struggling San Francisco-based lender. First Republic Bank’s share price had collapsed by a staggering 97% this year following the crisis of confidence triggered by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March. According to a report by The Telegraph, First Republic Bank’s deposits plunged by $100 billion in the first quarter of the year, highlighting the severity of the crisis. The sale of the bank to JPMorgan indicates the dire state of the US banking industry and the need for urgent action to prevent a complete collapse. Furthermore, according to The Telegraph, The US Federal Reserve has begun a two-day meeting to determine whether it should raise its benchmark lending rate for the tenth time. Since March last year, the Fed has aggressively increased interest rates to combat high inflation, which remains above its long-term target of two percent. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is widely expected to raise its base rate by a quarter-point on Wednesday, bringing the interest rate to between 5 and 5.25%, the highest level since the global financial crisis. The situation is not just concerning for investors but also the wider US economy. The banking industry plays a critical role in the economy, and a collapse could have severe repercussions, including a credit crunch and a recession.

12297884,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=529556,1683052705,Avalanche (AVAX) Climbs Higher: Q1 2023 Results Show Impressive Growth,"According to the latest report by Messari, Avalanche (AVAX) has shown a strong rebound in the first quarter of 2023. The market cap of the blockchain platform increased by 65.8% quarter on quarter (QoQ), reflecting the broader market trend and the thaw of the crypto winter that took by storm the crypto industry in 2022. Related Reading: Uniswap (UNI) Tanks As Bears Take Charge, Will The Bulls Come To Rescue? Avalanche’s Q1 2023 Performance According to the report, Avalanche experienced a decline in daily average active addresses and transactions during Q1 2023. The 20.7% and 31.9% decline followed an anomalous spike and a high growth period of subnet activity in Q4. However, the report also highlights that Avalanche’s supply of Bitcoin BEP2, a token on the Binance chain (BTC.b), increased by 64% during Q1, reaching over $250 million in market cap. This is a positive sign for the platform’s growth and demonstrates the increasing interest in Avalanche as a blockchain platform. The report further notes that mainstream interest in Avalanche network infrastructure continued to grow during Q1, with partnerships with blockchain services (AWS) and Tencent Cloud, a secure, reliable, and high-performance cloud computing service. This demonstrates the growing recognition of Avalanche as a major player in the blockchain space. In addition, Avalanche launched several notable developments during Q1 aimed at ushering in developers. These include the launch of HyperSDK, Glacier API, and integration with The Graph. These developments are expected to increase the adoption of Avalanche as a blockchain platform and attract more developers to build on the platform. The Avalanche Effect According to Messari, Avalanche’s Total Value Locked (TVL) denominated in USD increased by 4.2% QoQ in Q1 2023, following the crypto market relief rally in January. However, TVL denominated in AVAX declined by 34.3%, suggesting that the increase in USD was due to asset price increases rather than new capital inflow. Despite this decline, liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) and yield farming platforms supported Avalanche and its DeFi ecosystem. Benqi liquid staking TVL grew by 88.6% QoQ to $100 million by the end of Q1, and Vector Finance, a yield optimization platform, increased by 50% QoQ to $36 million. Collectively, these two protocols finished Q1 in the top 10 by TVL, with ~$136 million in TVL. Avalanche’s most prominent protocol by TVL denominated in USD, Aave, was down slightly 5% QoQ, but Benqi Lending, Trader Joe, and GMX grew by 49%, 24%, and 70%, respectively. However, there remained concentration risk in the leading application, with Aave making up 43% ($432 million) of Avalanche’s DeFi TVL by the end of Q1. Avalanche Validators Show Volatility According to the report, Avalanche’s network health remained stable in Q1 2023, with the average number of validators, total stake, and average engaged stake remaining consistent. However, the average number of delegators grew by 26.1% QoQ, indicating increasing participation in the network. Despite the stability of stake across a greater number of validators and delegates, there was some volatility in the number of validators that went offline during Q1. Both the average amount of unresponsive stakes and the number of unresponsive validators increased by over 70% QoQ. However, the percentage of unresponsive stakeholders and validators remained high enough to sustain block production. Overall, the Messari report indicates that Avalanche’s network health remained stable in Q1 2023, with consistent numbers of validators, total stake, and average engaged stake. The growth in the number of delegators also suggests increasing participation in the network. While there was some volatility in the number of validators that went offline during Q1, the percentage of unresponsive stakes and validators remained high enough to sustain block production. These findings demonstrate the continued growth and resilience of the Avalanche network and its potential for further expansion and adoption in the blockchain space.

Will It Expand Even More by Disregarding the SEC?,"Coinbase has launched a new derivatives exchange in Bermuda, a totemic act showing the largest U.S. crypto exchange means business when it says U.S. crypto regulations are increasingly nonviable. The exchange, which has been publicly feuding with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over a range of issues, received its license to operate in the island nation last month as it looks to test the international waters.  Founded by CEO Brian Armstrong in 2012, Coinbase has grown to become the second-largest crypto exchange – trailing only the HQ-less Binance – by trading volume, largely by working closely with U.S. regulators. Its IPO in 2021 came at the end of a lengthy diligence process with the SEC, leading many to think that the agency had endorsed its business model. But over the past couple of years, under Gary Gensler’s regime as chairman of the SEC, the company has found itself at an impasse with the regulator.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The watchdog agency has blocked a number of new services Coinbase wanted to bring to market, including a crypto lending program called Earn and a “staking-as-a-service” platform that would offer U.S. users dividend-like yield payments. Despite being asked numerous times to “register” with the SEC as an official securities exchange, Coinbase has instead fought a definitional battle over which crypto tokens do and do not count as securities (the exchange maintains it does not list “investment contracts”).  The new Bermuda-based Coinbase International Exchange is starting small – an attempt to gain a sliver of the share of professional investors and traders outside the U.S. At writing, the “exchange” is basically just an API, without a dedicated app or website, Axios reported. Only bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) derivatives contracts will be offered at launch, with leverage option capped at 5%.  But the new vertical is also a sign of the exchange’s increasingly global perspective. Although Coinbase has operated across Europe and parts of Asia, Africa and Latin America for years, it has recently become more vocal about building internationally. In an April blog post, the exchange said it has begun talking with financial regulators in Abu Dhabi (which is building a crypto/fintech tech sandbox) while Armstrong, following a conversation with the U.K.’s Economic Secretary and City Minister, Andrew Griffith, said the country is “moving fast on sensible crypto regulation.”  Other exchanges have pulled out of the U.S. such as Bittrex, which recently shuttered its stateside operations shortly before being sued by the SEC. Eric Voorhees’ Shapeshift didn’t exactly exit the country, but did move further into the ether when it closed its corporate entity to become a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).  However, by most accounts, many have seen Coinbase’s messaging as an empty threat.  Despite attempts to diversify its revenue streams, the exchange essentially only makes money by charging U.S. crypto users above-average trading fees (which people seem to happily pay for Coinbase’s trusted brand reputation and easy-to-use interface). In its most recent SEC filing, the exchange said the U.S. represents roughly 40% of its customer base, with another 25% in the EU and U.K.  ""As more and more markets are moving forward with regulatory frameworks to become crypto hubs, we believe the moment is right to launch this international exchange,"" Coinbase said in its most recent announcement. ""We would like to see the U.S. take a similar approach instead of regulation by enforcement, which has led to a disappointing trend for crypto development in the U.S.""  It’s worth saying that Coinbase spelled out in plain language that it has no immediate attempts to flee the U.S. ""Rest assured that Coinbase is committed to the U.S.,” its blog post said. This might be because the exchange thinks it has a sound argument when it comes to its increasingly fraught relationship with the SEC. The agency recently sent Coinbase a “Wells Notice,” tipping it off that the agency is building a case against the exchange.  Coinbase said it would fight the SEC in the courts if it is sued. But at this point the exchange’s lawyers may just be attempting to wait out Gensler's tenure. Although there’s no guarantee the next SEC chair would be any less lenient, the exchange does have allies at the securities agency.  See also: Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Says Exchange Will go to Court if Necessary | CoinDesk TV  SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce, for instance, broke ranks and recently published her dissenting opinion stating the commission’s attempts to redefine what an “exchange” legally means to apply it to crypto firms was an attempt “to solve problems that do not exist.” Further, she said the SEC’s antagonistic stance against crypto would drive the industry overseas or towards harder-to-police areas of decentralized finance (DeFi).  Coinbase can prefer to continue operating in the U.S. while building up operations elsewhere. But the SEC needs to get the message soon that at some point the U.S. market may just not be worth it. This is especially as other jurisdictions take a more collaborative approach towards regulating crypto.

Big Inc, a 15,000-unit sequel to the Goblintown collection, has not publicly released a date or time for the mint. The collection is looking for “the worst traders in NFT land,” a spokesperson from Truth Labs told CoinDesk, and will prioritize collectors based on their “rekt activity,” or poor trades in the space.  “If you are one of the top 1,000 worst traders in NFT land you get 24 hours to mint your Big Inc acceptance letter for free,” Truth Labs said. Holders of other Truth Labs NFT collections, including Goblintown, Grumpl and Illuminati, will also have special privileges to mint their Big Inc tokens for free.  Process Grey, co-founder and artist at Truth Labs told CoinDesk that Goblintown Season 2 aims to celebrate the culture and community that has created Web3, whether times be bullish or bearish.  ""Currently everyone is down and to a lot of folks it feels like only the influencers survived the past year,"" Process Grey, co-founder and artist at Truth Labs told CoinDesk. ""Goblintown originally celebrated on the collective doom of the first wave of collapse -- and Big Inc wants to now reward those who have stuck around!""  Goblintown Season 2 is based on the narrative of Big Inc, a large corporation in the fictional Goblintown that has brainwashed animals to become its employees. The collection’s artwork features profile pictures (PFP) that depict the animal heads with “super serious” expressions.  Interested collectors can apply to mint and Truth Labs will analyze wallet data to determine the quality of a trader’s NFT transactions. This will place traders on the “Down Bad Board,” or leaderboard of the worst traders in the space.  Additionally, the collection plans to capitalize on the popularity of meme coin PEPE, whose price has increased by 2,100% in the last month, increasing its market cap to $502 million. Goblintown Season 2 will allow traders to receive a discount on the token mint if they pay in PEPE, giving utility to the token.  Mint participants can pay 0.096 ether (ETH), or about $175. Traders that choose to pay for the collection in PEPE will receive a 50% discount, with NFTs dynamically priced at 0.048 ETH, or about $88.  When Goblintown opened its mint in May 2022, the collection generated $7 million in sales and defied standard NFT market trends at the time.  According to data from OpenSea, Goblintown has a floor price of 0.33 ETH, about $600. Its trading volume stands at 63,422 ETH, over $116 million.",POSITIVE,ETH | PEPE,ETH | MARKET | MINING | TRADING | PEPE,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/05/02/nft-collection-goblintown-will-prioritize-the-worst-traders-in-second-season-mint,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c9f5a888153f82d9bd9e85c6cbc7d566d9067744-1158x886.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ethereum Exchange Inflows Have Shot Up During The Past Day According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, this increase in the supply on exchanges is the largest observed since the day before the Merge. The “supply on exchanges” is an indicator that, as its name already implies, measures the percentage of the total Ethereum supply that’s currently sitting in the wallets of all centralized exchanges. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: Miners Continue To Sell When the value of this metric increases, it means investors are depositing some coins to exchanges right now. This kind of trend can have bearish consequences for the asset’s price as one of the main reasons why investors transfer their coins to exchanges is for selling-related purposes. On the other hand, decreasing values of this indicator imply a net amount of ETH is exiting these platforms currently. Such withdrawals can be a sign that the holders are accumulating the cryptocurrency, which can naturally be bullish for the asset’s value in the long term. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Ethereum supply on exchanges over the last few months: Looks like the value of the metric has shot up in recent days | Source: Santiment on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum supply on exchanges has observed a sharp rise in the past day, meaning that investors have deposited a large amount of ETH to these platforms. In the chart, there is also the data for another ETH indicator: the “exchange flow balance.” This metric measures the net number of coins that are flowing into or out of exchanges, meaning that the exchange flow balance essentially tracks the changes happening in the supply on exchanges indicator. During the past day, this metric has seen a large positive value, suggesting that inflows have far surpassed the outflows in this period. According to the metric, around 320,000 ETH ($584.6 million at the current price) has entered into the wallets of the exchanges with this spike. This net increase in the exchange supply is in fact the largest that the cryptocurrency has seen since September 14, 2022, the day before the transition towards the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism took place. Related Reading: Internet Computer (ICP) Social Dominance Hits 23-Month High, Top In?

It’s uncertain whether the whale has made this deposit with the intention to sell, or for using any other of the services offered by the platform. However, if selling is truly the goal here, then this massive inflow can be bad news for the asset’s price.

The announcement on Tuesday says it will be the world's first complete NFT ticket service, allowing event owners, organizers and promoters to use Box Office to build further engagement opportunities into tickets, such as highlights, collectibles and offers through a feature called ""Super Ticket.""

The use of NFTs as tickets to live events has often been touted as a potential mass-market use case of Web3 technology. A major name such as Sports Illustrated weighing in to the sector may give NFT ticketing some additional momentum.  “Blockchain technology offers significant benefits for consumers, particularly ticketing, including enhancing payment security, and eliminating scalping and fraud,” said Brian Trunzo, head of business development, North America, for Polygon Labs, in the press release, who added that this launch would help grow consumer adoption.

As the market opened, the price dropped to $5.30, where UNI found little support. Bulls are trying to regain control, but selling pressure is quite strong. The coin started exhibiting bearish momentum after April 19, 2023, when sharp crashes were observed in the chart. As of today, May 2, it has continued the bearish trend. UNI Price Trend In April Uniswap opened in April at $6.0603 and t traded around the same price level at the start of the next day before recording a pullback to $5.9461 at the close of the market. Luckily, UNI regained its grip above $6 on April 4. Related Reading: Terra Classic Recent Efforts Could Benefit LUNC’s Growth Potential UNI maintained the same price level from April 4 to 7 before dipping to $5.9191 on April 8.

It remained at the level until April 20, when it lost the grip falling to the $5 price range and continuing till today, May 2. Will Uniswap (UNI) Recover From This Downtrend?

Related Reading: AVAX Smart Contracts Hit 6-Month High – What This Means For Its Price The 1-day price chart for Uniswap price analysis indicates that the UNI bulls are doing their best to control the price decline. However, the bears are still in charge of today’s price trend. But despite being under selling pressure today, the value of UNI/USD has only decreased by 1.74% percent over the past 24 hours. UNI price is in a zone where investors or traders are afraid to buy UNI, and holders will likely sell due to the current market sentiment. As such, the downtrend might continue, except the bulls build back the bullish momentum. UNI Key Price Levels Based on the Uniswap chart today, the coin directly supports $4.628. If the bears continue this momentum, the next significant level is $3.341. The coin will have trouble breaking past the $7.761 resistance level with this low momentum. Since April 18, 2023, when the price of Uniswap fell below its 50-day SMA, this indicator has been indicating a SELL signal.

Kraines became CFO two years ago. DCG has engaged Heidrick & Struggles for a new CFO search, according to a letter to shareholders, and President Mark Murphy and Chief Strategy Officer Simon Koster will run the finance department in the meantime.  Also in the letter, DCG, which is CoinDesk's parent company, reported first-quarter revenue of $180 million, up 63% from the fourth quarter as crypto prices soared, though still down from a year earlier. It also reported a $6 million loss last quarter, based on adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda).  The company was hit hard by the collapse of the crypto market last year, and its Genesis lending division ended up in bankruptcy court. DCG lost $1.1 billion in 2022 amid citing plunging crypto prices and the restructuring of Genesis.  DCG said that based on its first-quarter performance, it's headed toward 2023 revenue and Ebitda of roughly $620 million and $140 million, respectively – excluding the Genesis business, which remains in Chapter 11.

According to Ethereum block explorer etherscan, PEPE has around 75,000 holders with several wallets – excluding centralized exchanges – holding in excess of $5 million worth of the tokens.  The PEPE token surged by a 350% over the weekend alone, and derivatives exchange BitMEX on Tuesday said it is listing perpetual swaps for the token, which will allow traders to trade the volatile asset with as much as 50 times leverage.  While hype around the meme token continues to build, some early investors have been cashing out. One trader sold $2 million worth of the token using MetaMask swaps. They ended up losing $350,000 as they were hit with 25% slippage due to minimal liquidity.  Another trader temporarily tanked the price of PEPE by almost 50% as they cashed out $678,000 worth of the token.  PEPE's price action is reminiscent of dogecoin over the years, with intense volatility being caused by an absence of liquidity or sustainable demand.

In the current environment, altcoins in general continue to show weakness across the board. However, one altcoin that is exhibiting relative strength, backed by on-chain activity, is ARB. Arbitrum is an optimistic L2 rollup with the main purpose of helping Ethereum scale by enabling L2 transactions with much faster confirmation time. The project has established itself as one of the top names in decentralized finance (DeFi) in recent months. Remarkably, it also houses the most popular perpetual DEX with GMX. ARB Price Shows Relative Strength A look at the ARB/BTC chart (2-hour chart) shows that the altcoin has formed an uptrend in recent days. The ascending triangle has its resistance line at 0.00004737. If ARB writes further higher lows against BTC despite the generally pressured altcoins market, it could ultimately break through the resistance and rally towards 0.00004850. The 4-hour chart ARB/USDT reveals that Arbitrum is currently holding just above the most crucial support level at $1.29. If the price level is breached to the downside, the $1.20 to $1.24 range would be key. Related Reading: Bullish Momentum Expected For ARB As Arbitrum Completes DAO Airdrop To the upside, the key resistance is at $1.42. However, on the way up the 200-day EMA, currently sitting at $1.35, could also provide some minor headwinds. Fueled by a Bitcoin rally, however, the resistance at $1.42 seems within reach without further ado. Should BTC break above $30,000, ARB bulls could even target a move up to $1.56. Arbitrum On-Chain Activity Remains Ultra Strong Arbitrum’s current technical strength on the charts coincides with its on-chain activity. Most metrics for Arbitrum are at an all-time high. Most importantly, the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem has remained solid after the airdrop, showing increased activity, as researched by analyst Francesco, who states: Contrary to what was expected after the airdrop, TVL is rising: GMX still remains the best perpetual DEX, and Arbitrum still remains the home of DeFi due to its composability, cheap fees, and fast confirmation times. Related Reading: Arbitrum Soars 44% To Record Highs As Whales Splash Millions On ARB Tokens Arbitrum leads on almost every metric, especially TVL. The fact that more users have switched to zkSync is most likely due to airdrop hunters. Arbitrum’s TVL is currently over $2.2 billion, an increase of over 100% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. The primary reason for this is the perpetual DEX called GMX, which is Arbitrum’s leading protocol with over $500 million or 26% of TVL. However, with Radiant, Stargate and Camelot DEX, Arbitrum based projects also occupy three more places within the top 6 decentralized exchanges, underlining the growth of the entire ecosystem. Furthermore, Arbitrum ranks 4th among all blockchains by TVL, just behind the layer-1’s Ethereum, Tron, and BSC.

42420617,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqPd7,1683032401,Decentralized Exchange Maverick Rolls Out Liquidity Incentives for Price Stability,"Decentralized exchange (DEX) platform Maverick Protocol has unveiled a novel incentive system that can help stablecoins and ether (ETH) liquid staking derivatives keep their price pegs, the protocol said in a press release on Tuesday.  The incentive system allows token issuers such as liquid staking protocols or stablecoin issuers to create so-called “boosted positions,” offering extra rewards to liquidity providers in a customized price range in Maverick’s liquidity pools.  Maverick is built around an automated market maker (AMM) algorithm, where traders can swap digital assets without any intermediary in liquidity pools. Token holders can also deploy their assets in the pools to provide liquidity for trading while earning a share of the trading fees.  The protocol’s latest upgrade comes as decentralized exchanges (DEX) are fiercely competing to attract traders and traffic onto their platforms as crypto investors seek decentralized trading venues after multiple blowups of centralized marketplaces and increasing regulatory stranglehold.  To do so, some DEXs offer extra rewards on top of the transaction revenues to liquidity providers to deploy their capital, such as Curve Finance’s “gauge” system. These rewards are generally paid by the token issuers in the liquidity pool.  However, “current incentive systems are too blunt,” Bob Baxley, core developer of Maverick, said.  Maverick’s tool is more efficient than existing offerings because it allows token issuers to concentrate reward payouts to a certain price range and build price walls, Baxley explained in an interview.  This can also help pegged assets such as stablecoins and liquid staking derivatives keep their prices more stable, while liquidity providers can earn additional revenue, according to the press release.  Token issuers, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols or stablecoin issuers, can pay out rewards in the form of any token of their choice over a period between three and thirty days, the press release said.  For example, Lido Finance, the largest ether (ETH) liquid staking protocol and issuer of the stETH token, has already approved to deploy incentives to Maverick’s wstETH-ETH liquidity pool in May, paid out in Lido’s governance token LDO, according to a Lido governance forum post.  Baxley said the development would help position Maverick as the go-to marketplace for ETH liquid staking derivatives after the highly anticipated Shanghai upgrade, which allowed users to withdraw locked-up tokens from the Ethereum blockchain. Liquid staking lets investors earn staking rewards while maintaining their ability to borrow and lend with a derivative token representing their locked-up assets in staking.  Liquid staking protocols have become increasingly popular among investors and analysts forecast further growth for the sector following the Shanghai upgrade.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | SPONSORED | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/02/decentralized-exchange-maverick-rolls-out-liquidity-incentives-for-price-stability,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a14390d38e93e191721bb6e0ee1b10b541182953-2858x1596.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420631,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqPlN,1683031337,First Mover Americas: BRC-20 Tokens Skyrocket,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Interest in ""Bitcoin Request for Comment,"" or BRC-20, tokens built with Ordinals and stored on the Bitcoin base chain has skyrocketed, lifting their market value by several hundred percent. As of writing, the combined market cap of more than 8,800 BRC-20 tokens was $137 million, a staggering 682% rise from $17.5 million seen a week ago, according to data tracked by Ordspace. A pseudonymous on-chain analyst named Domo created the BRC-20 token standard in early March to facilitate the issue and transfer of fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. The experimental invention came weeks after Ordinals Protocol went live, allowing users to inscribe digital art references into small transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain.The BRC-20 standard sounds like the popular ERC-20 standard, but the two are different, with the former lacking the ability to interact with smart contracts.  Crypto lender Celsius Network is seeking to mingle its U.K. and U.S. entities as court filings allege the distinction between the two was a “sham.” The bankrupt crypto firm is the latest to face allegations of poor record-keeping in its corporate structure, in a court fight which is pitting its customers against Series B investors. In 2021, the firm – whose Celsius Network Limited arm had been warned to cease U.K. operations by that country's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) – set up a limited liability company (LLC) in Delaware and sought to transfer assets through a series of financial transactions.  Tron founder Justin Sun on Monday said that he has arranged a full refund of a $56 million transfer to exchange platform Binance after a warning from the latter's CEO against a potential token grab of the new SUI token. After the substantial transfer made in trueUSD (TUSD) got flagged by Whale Alert early Monday, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao took to Twitter to say his platform has warned Sun it will take action if he used any of the funds to buy up large amounts of SUI tokens from Binance's Launchpool. ""Binance LaunchPool are meant as air drops for our retail users, not just for a few whales,"" Zhao said. The SUI token drop, the native token of layer1 blockchain Sui, is set to take place once the mainnet goes live on May 3. On Sunday, Binance announced the SUI token will be available via its Launchpool, which allows users to stake their crypto assets to provide funds into a liquidity pool and get rewards in return.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the net inflow of ether into centralized exchanges going back to November.  On Monday, exchanges registered a net inflow of more than 285,000 ETH, the biggest single-day tally since Dec. 9.  Exchange inflows are often equated with investor intention to sell or use coins as a margin in derivatives trading.

The bank cut its rating on the exchange's stock from buy to neutral and cut its price target to $65 from $80. Coinbase shares dropped 1.2% to $49.54 in premarket trading.  “Coinbase’s notions of redomiciling outside of the U.S., the company’s public responses and now a formal suit against the [Securities and Exchange Commission] are indicative that the [Wells Notice's] process has not (yet?) been productive,” analysts led by Peter Chistiansen wrote.  “The failure of Signature Bank and whether it was crypto related along with other events of the past year are all fodder for the SEC,” the analysts wrote.  Citi says that Coinbase remains a category leader and “one of the better positioned platforms should broader integration with traditional finance occur,” but the exchange is now being “tasked to advocate for a reputationally damaged industry and pave a sustainable pathway towards regulatory compliance.”  Read more: Coinbase Will Be ‘Best Investment’ Over Next 5 Years: Boost VC’s Adam Draper",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Will Canny,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/05/02/coinbase-faced-with-too-much-regulatory-uncertainty-rating-cut-to-neutral-citi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5bf975ebdaec00fd12fc7eb65ea20ff741790bc6-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to its daily chart, the bearish trend began two days ago, following three-day bullish moves. The turn in the market sentiment has resulted in the recent plunge in ICP price. Aside from this, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is also down by 1.89% over the past 24 hours. This could also be a factor affecting ICP’s price at the moment. While a reversal is not certain, some technical indicators can show whether or not the chances are high. Internet Computer (ICP) Price Outlook Judging from the ICP price of $3.9309 at the start of 2023, the token has made more bullish moves than bearish ones. ICP currently trades at $5.719, showing a 24-hour price decline of 5.99%. Related Reading: Terra Classic Recent Efforts Could Benefit LUNC’s Growth Potential The token’s market cap has dropped by 6.50% in the last 24 hours to around $2.46 billion. The trading volume within the same period has also declined by 20.69%, hovering around $60,208,714. The plummeting value of the trading volume indicates more selling pressure among investors and traders. If this trend continues, ICP may likely see its price fall to the $5 price level before the end of the day. Moreover, data suggests that the general price prediction sentiment of the Internet Computer token is bearish. Based on its findings, 17 indicators signal a bearish trend, while 11 technical indicators display bullish signals. But let’s consider some major indicators from the daily chart to confirm its potential move further. ICP Technical Analysis The price of the Internet Computer token is currently above the 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages. While that is supposed to indicate a buy tendency, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) negates it, as it stands at 50.42. This figure suggests a neutral state in the ICP market but with higher odds of selling pressure. The token made a Death Cross several days back which lead to a significant drop in its price. The market may create a Golden Cross later on, but this might come after a major decline in its price, considering the interpretation of the technical indicators. Related Reading: AVAX Smart Contracts Hit 6-Month High – What This Means For Its Price The chart also shows that ICP’s price fell from a resistance level of $6.339. Crypto traders and investors can expect its price to fall further to hit the closest support level of $4.996. Other resistance and support levels are $7.449 and $4.525, respectively. Note that even while the technical indicators can be a helpful tool for analysis, investment decisions shouldn’t be made solely based on them. Traders should also consider various factors and risk management strategies.

42393618,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj1VGx,1683024834,Number of Stablecoins Held on Exchanges Slips to 2-Year Low,"The number of stablecoins, or dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies, held in addresses tied to centralized exchanges extended its decline to reach the lowest since May 2021 in a sign of increasing investor aversion to risk.  As of Monday, the balance was 21.06 billion, according to Glassnode data. The blockchain analytics firm tracks exchange balances for BUSD, GUSD, HSUD, DAI, USDP, EURS, SAI, sUSD, USDT and USDC.  The tally has more than halved since reaching a record high of over 44 billion in mid-December. It gathered pace following the U.S. regulatory crackdown on Paxos' BUSD in February and the subsequent USDC volatility in March.  ""It's a reflection of risk aversion towards stablecoins following Paxos being told by regulators to stop issuing BUSD and the recent de-pegging of USDC,"" said Dick Lo, the founder and CEO of quant-driven trading firm TDX Strategies. ""There has also been a steady decline in the market cap of BUSD and USDC.""  Paxos stopped minting the centralized dollar-pegged stablecoin BUSD in February, complying with the regulatory order from New York. USDC, the world's second-largest stablecoin, experienced price volatility in March after issuer Circle revealed it held cash balances at the-then crisis-stricken Silicon Valley Bank.  Tether (USDT), the world's largest stablecoin by market value, has become more dominant amid the decline in the exchange balance, while BUSD and USDC have lost ground.  Lack of new money inflows  Investors have increasingly preferred stablecoins to fund crypto purchases over the past three years because they help bypass price volatility associated with other tokens.  A dwindling stablecoin balance coinciding with a bitcoin price rise suggests the rotation of money out of stablecoins and into BTC has been the major driver of the cryptocurrency's 70% rally this year. The market has yet to see new money inflows.  Investors parked money in stablecoins last year as the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate-hike cycle aimed at controlling inflation boosted the appeal of the U.S. dollar (USD) and equivalents. However, the motivation to hold USD has weakened since late last year amid hopes for renewed liquidity easing.  ""Activity-wise, stablecoin balances on CeFi [centralized] exchanges continue to dwindle with little new incremental capital entering the ecosystem,"" SignalPlus, a tech firm focused on democratizing crypto options, said in a daily market report.  ""Furthermore, user activity on DeFi/[non-fungible tokens]/GameFi remains heavily depressed despite the recovery in spot prices, reinforcing our cautious view on crypto prices in the near future,"" SignalPlus said.",NEGATIVE,BTC | USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | USDC,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/02/number-of-stablecoins-held-on-exchanges-slips-to-2-year-low-of-2106b,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/819300889f62d42bf0899444187c74cfad0d5427-2463x1496.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42393613,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj1UrJ,1683024479,"UK Crypto Tax Advisers Welcome Proposed Changes to DeFi Lending, Staking Treatment","Tax advisers in the U.K. have welcomed proposed rules for decentralized finance (DeFi) lending and staking activities, calling it a positive step that offers some “certainty” for the crypto industry.  On Thursday, the U.K. government's tax branch, His Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC), announced it will be consulting crypto stakeholders for the next eight weeks on its plan.  The new framework proposes that capital gains tax charges for DeFi lending or staking be triggered only with some activities – and not for all transactions.  ""This is a positive step for the crypto asset industry in the U.K. Whilst regulators may appear in the U.S. to be creating confusion, these moves aim to provide certainty for the U.K. industry,” Dion Seymour, crypto and digital asset technical director of U.K. tax service provider Andersen, said in an emailed statement to CoinDesk.  “We applaud HMRC for being the first tax administration to provide specific rules for DeFi,” Seymour added.  David Lesperance, managing director and tax adviser at Lesperance Associates, called the HMRC’s proposal an “excellent result,” in a statement. Meanwhile, lawmaker Lisa Cameron, chair of a cross-party group for crypto in Parliament, said she was hopeful this would be the first step towards a comprehensive tax framework.  Simplifying crypto taxes  The government said in its consultation that it agreed with industry members who had previously called for specific rules for DeFi markets, similar to those for repo and stock lending.  Ian Taylor, board adviser at industry lobby group CryptoUK, told CoinDesk in an interview in July that the crypto industry and its advocates were calling for new crypto tax rules for DeFi lending as the old ones triggered too many taxable events and were “outdated” policies.  However, while Lesperance believes this will simplify things for the industry, Seymour does not.  “An opportunity to simplify the rules may have been lost,"" Seymour said.  He pointed to another – in his view, simpler – option in the HMRC’s original call for evidence, which proposed treating the transfer of crypto for lending and staking as “no gain no loss” transactions, “deferring the tax liability until the assets are economically disposed of.”  By going with the authority’s proposed approach – that leans on repo and stock lending rules and would only remove some lending and staking activities from the scope of capital gains tax – complicates the tracking of taxable events, according to Seymour.  In its consultation, the HMRC said the “no gain, no loss” option would impose a larger administrative burden, while offering less flexibility to accommodate future legislative changes to match new developments in the DeFi world.  Seymour also noted the potential danger in people thinking there aren’t going to be any taxable events in DeFi.  “The general public who already have a very scant knowledge about how tax works and are even less inclined to actually read HMRC guidance, so the education side is still going to be quite critical,” he said.

The letter was sent on April 18 to OPNX's Kyle Davies and Su Zhu, who were the founders of 3AC, after two cease-and-desist orders for marketing the exchange to residents of Dubai and the United Arab Emirates were issued by the regulator in February and March.  “VARA is continuing to actively monitor the situation and investigate OPNX's activity to assess further corrective measures that may be required to protect the market,” Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority said in a statement.  The reprimand was also sent to OPNX founders Mark Lamb and Sudhu Arumugam and to Chief Executive Officer Leslie Lamb, the regulator said.  OPNX, which allows investors to trade bankruptcy claims for companies such as FTX and CoinFLEX, has had a rocky start, with under $2 traded in its first 24 hours of opening. Trading firms Susquehanna International Group (SIG) and DRW, as well as venture-capital firm Nascent – all claimed by OPNX to be “major investors” in the project – have have denied involvement.

12286241,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=529451,1683016234,"Bitcoin Market Update: Up Or Down, What’s Next As Fed Rate Hike Looms?","Bitcoin bears have gained control over the last few weeks, at least in the short term, and the battle seems to be on. After Bitcoin failed again at the $30,000 level on Sunday as part of a “weekend pump,” the bears are pushing towards $27,000. As of press time, Bitcoin was hovering around $28,000, having already tested key support at $27,800 yesterday evening (EST). The long-term trend continues to be clearly in favor of the Bitcoin bulls, for which a price above $25,000 speaks. However, in the short term, the key is to defend the $27,800 level to avoid a deeper correction to $25,000, as also indicated by analyst XO. $BTC pic.twitter.com/OKS791fYEi — XO (@Trader_XO) May 1, 2023 Bitcoin Remains In Trading Range For technical analyst Michaël van de Poppe, founder of Eight Global, breaking through $28,400 on the shorter time frame is the trend-setting price level. “Breaking through $28.4K and we could be back to $30K in a few days. Not breaking and folding coming days, $25K next. Big volatility on the horizon,” the analyst warns. However, the current weakness that Bitcoin is displaying with hovering around $28,000 could be an indication that another sweep of the lows is needed to generate new upside momentum. “Still eyeing $27.8K for a potential long here, or a break and flip of $28.4 for Bitcoin,” van de Poppe notes. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds At $29,300 As PCE Comes Out Neutral Glassnode co-founders Yann Allemann and Jan Happel write in their latest analysis that Bitcoin’s April monthly close was a major sign for the bulls. BTC closed in green for the fourth consecutive month. According to the analysts, the short-term trading channel is between $27,000 – $29,200. [B]ut we are confident that we will be over $30k in no time. Our thesis solidifies the longer we’re above the highly active $28 – $28.2k level. Notice the large horizontal bar. All Eyes On The Fed Key to the price action in the coming weeks may be the FOMC meeting tomorrow, Wednesday, and the subsequent press conference by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. The market expects a final hike of 25 basis points. This will put the U.S. benchmark interest rate at the same level as before the financial crisis in 2007. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Crashing, But Why Are Transactions At New All-Time Highs However, the decision is likely to be priced in already. More important will be the FOMC press conference at 2:30 pm EST, when Powell will give his remarks for the coming months. The market will be hoping for a comment from Powell that this was the last rate hike and that the first rate cuts will come later this year (very unlikely). The focus will also be on Powell’s comments on the banking crisis and how the credit crunch is intensifying. Most likely, Powell will play both sides, as he did at the March FOMC meeting. Comments such as “inflation is not quite where we want it to be,” “monitoring developments in the banking sector,” and “data dependence” are virtually guaranteed. On the bullish side, Powell could signal a pause in June and leave a door open for rate hikes if data grants it. Lol … volatile day coming tomorrow, and perhaps a decisive trend setter for the coming weeks. The start of a new #Bitcoin rally? https://t.co/Dd8FWOjsDa — Jake Simmons (@realJakeSimmons) May 2, 2023 At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $28,100, below the mid-range after rejecting at the range high again. Until the FOMC decision, it seems rather unlikely that BTC will make a major move unless there is another short or long squeeze due to the madness in the futures market. A recapture of the upper range would be a bullish sign going into the FOMC.

As of writing, the combined market cap of more than 8,800 BRC-20 tokens was $137 million – a staggering 682% rise from $17.5 million seen a week ago, according to data tracked by Ordinals-builder Ordspace. (For a brief moment early Tuesday, the website showed the total market cap at $2.93 billion. Ordspace said the figure wasn't accurate and likely resulted from low liquidity in some of the tokens.)  A pseudonymous on-chain analyst named Domo created the BRC-20 token standard in early March to facilitate the issue and transfer of fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. The experimental invention came weeks after Ordinals Protocol went live, allowing users to inscribe digital art references into small transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain.  ""Ordinals on Bitcoin have had unintentional consequences. Of these is the invention of the BRC-20 fungible token standard. It’s now possible to create fungible tokens on BT,"" pseudonymous analyst and yield farmer Dynamo DeFi said in the latest edition of the weekly newsletter. ""Since inception, BRC-20s have accounted for nearly 6% of all Bitcoin activity.""  The BRC-20 standard sounds like the popular ERC-20 standard, but the two are different, with the former lacking the ability to interact with smart contracts. The ERC-20 is the technical standard for fungible tokens created using Ethereum, the premier smart contract blockchain.  ""This [BRC-20] is not a token standard like you’re accustomed to with [Ethereum Virtual Machine] chains, which create smart contracts that manage the token standard and its various rules. Instead, it’s simply a way to store a script file in Bitcoin and use it to attribute tokens to satoshis and then allow them to be transferred between users,"" crypto exchange Binance said in an explainer.  Most active BRC-20 tokens fall into meme coins – cryptocurrencies originating from an internet meme or humorous characteristic. At press time, the top three coins minted using the BRC-20 standard were ORDI, OG and PEPE.  According to Boolean Fund's Mark Jeffrey, the launch of BRC-20 tokens has eliminated the need for crypto exchanges.  ""With BRC-20s, the Bitcoin blockchain is the exchange. There is no Binance, no Coinbase required. Just a bitcoin wallet. You create, buy and sell with sats.

In 2021, the firm – whose Celsius Network Limited arm had been warned to cease U.K. operations by the country's Financial Conduct Authority – set up a Limited Liability Company in Delaware and sought to transfer assets through a series of financial transactions.  “The migration resulted in intercompany chaos,” a May 1 filing by Celsius said, adding that internal records are “sorely lacking,” making it hard if not impossible to disentangle each entity’s affairs.  Regular customers, misled by management, didn’t understand the implications of this transfer – but more sophisticated Series B investors were well aware of deficient record keeping, the filing added, arguing that the two entities should be treated as one for bankruptcy purposes.  Parallel filings by a committee of Celsius’ creditors say the reorganization was a “sham” and a “facade,” and that the billions of dollars transferred between the two entities were fraudulent – implying they should be disregarded by the New York court that is attempting to restore funds to creditors.  That echoes claims made about FTX, whose attorneys described the bankrupt crypto exchange as a “digital Potemkin village,” whose slick front-end disguised a messy and ill-governed reality.  In a March 9 opinion, Judge Martin Glenn found that customers only had claims against the Delaware LLC entity – a finding which increases the chances that Series B preferred equity holders could recoup some of their investment, which would normally be downgraded under bankruptcy law.  In the week of July 24, Glenn will now consider Celsius’ argument that the two entities should be “substantively consolidated,” merging assets and customer claims.  Celsius filed for bankruptcy protection in July 2022. An auction of Celsius’ assets is scheduled to continue on Wednesday, with favored bidder NovaWulf now facing competition from Fahrenheit LLC and the Blockchain Recovery Investment Committee.

The charts of both cryptocurrencies turned green on April 28, but the situation went south over the following days. The Terra ecosystem is currently struggling to maintain its positive momentum, and the decline in LUNC’s price is indicative of this struggle.

The new divergence mechanism proposed is expected to stabilize the value of USTC and help the Terra ecosystem regain its former glory. While the recent decline in LUNC’s price is a cause for concern for some investors, the implementation of the new mechanism is likely to restore investor confidence in the Terra ecosystem. As the L1 team works towards implementing the mechanism in four phases, investors can look forward to a more stable and robust Terra ecosystem. -Featured image from Unsplash",NEUTRAL,AVAX | LUNC,AVAX | BUSINESS | LUNC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/lunc-proposal-11487-49-voter-nod/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/12282594.jpeg

42393626,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj1W17,1682988762,Volatile Price Moves on Monday Contrast to Recent Calm Waters,"Bitcoin’s decline on Monday contrasts to the asset’s lack of movement over the past six weeks. Bitcoin (BTC) recently fell nearly 4% over the past 24 hours to trade just above $28,000, but spent a good portion of the day below that level.  The decline follows lower prices in two of the last three trading days.  But prior to these drops, starting in mid-March, BTC price fluctuations have been more uneventful.  Indeed, since March 20, when bitcoin was changing hands at $28,270, BTC has moved only about .002%.  The weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) for BTC actually declined by 8% over the same period, giving birth to competing interpretations of that development. The first is that momentum is diverging from price, a traditionally bearish event for prices.  An alternative interpretation is that BTC has gotten cheaper, even as prices have risen. Which interpretation one chooses to anchor to is likely based on a number of factors, including portfolio size, cost basis and risk management.  Still, given BTC’s relatively low weekly trading volume since March, the aforementioned price-momentum divergence does not appear to have a lot of negative conviction behind it. On the contrary, it fits within a narrative of a recently tame crypto environment.  Admittedly, the consecutive weeks starting April 10 and April 17 provided a bout of excitement as the 7% increase in the former was offset by a 9% decline in the latter. Bitcoin’s push above $30,000 on April 11 pushed the asset through a significant psychological barrier, but with new catalysts being relatively scant, BTC retreated slightly.  A lack of catalysts applies to the bearish side as well for BTC. Outside of concerns regarding the Securities Exchange Commission’s (SEC) stance towards crypto and the potential for prohibitive legislation, a lack of catalysts applies to both sides of the trade at the moment.  What also appears to be lacking for bitcoin, despite its reputation to the contrary, is volatility. The Average True Range (ATR) for bitcoin has fallen 65% year to date, even as bitcoin's price has soared 75% over this period.
