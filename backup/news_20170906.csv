42379895,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Kxbf,1504728926,ICOs Welcome: Isle of Man to Unveil Friendly Framework for Token Sales,"The Isle of Man is opening its doors to entrepreneurs looking to launch initial coin offerings (ICO).  In an interview today, Brian Donegan, head of operations for fintech and digital development at the Isle of Man's Department of Economic Development, told CoinDesk that the British Crown dependency has created a regulatory framework – dubbed the Isle of Man Registered Designated Business ICO – that it believes will allow for token sales that are compliant with anti-money laundering and know-your-customer regulations.  The Isle of Man's government has yet to formally announce the development, though it's been moving in this direction for some time. The framework itself is based on anti-money laundering rules put in place in 2014 and 2015, Donegan said.  While regulators in places like Canada have offered some on-ramps for ICO organizers, the Isle of Man's move perhaps goes one step further in opening the door to a range of token sales. Adel, a fintech incubator that launched an ICO after incorporating on the island, effectively served as a test-bed for the concept.  As for why the dependency is moving to capitalize on the interest in ICOs today, Donegan's explanation was simple: there's a significant opportunity for governments that are early movers in creating accommodative environments for ICO organizers.  Donegan said:  ""Our understanding and analysis of the ICO market is that it represents a massive vertical market for us.""  Businesses looking to launch an ICO in the Isle of Man would be required to register with the relevant authorities within the dependency and follow the applicable regulations. That said, officials would play a supportive role for businesses as they move through the token sale process.  The move comes several years after the Isle of Man introduced legislation outlining rules for businesses that handle or exchange cryptocurrencies. The Isle of Man first revealed its plans to put rules in place for cryptocurrency businesses in 2014.  The government there later embraced the tech behind bitcoin for possible public-sector applications, launching a digital registry pilot in May 2015 that was later followed by work in other areas like IoT.  China reaction  This week saw the dramatic move by regulators in China to effectively outlaw ICOs, a decision that's had an impact on both domestic and international activity around the funding model.  When asked to comment on the move, Donegan said it highlights ""a real, absolute need for AML/KYC compliance specifically tailored for ICOs"" – something that he believes the Isle of Man can provide.  He went on to reveal that the Isle of Man's government has already been seeing strong interest from token sale organizers, and that the move to develop a regulatory environment for ICOs was driven in part due to the prevalence of scams in the space.  ""I have to tell you, for every 10 applications we've had from ICO promoters over the last several months, I'd say only one of those gets through because there's a lot of scamming going on in the industry,"" he said, concluding:  ""What we're about is keeping consumers safe and keeping crime out.""

As previously reported, regulators issued a statement over the weekend which declared that ICOs constitute an illegal form of fundraising in China. The government ordered that ICO organizer refund investors, demanding that any related activities ""shall cease immediately.""  Signs indicate that China's exchange ecosystem – which earlier this year moved to accommodate new rules from the country's central bank – is quickly adapting to the guidance. Domestic exchanges Yunbihttps://yunbi.zendesk.com/hc/zh-cn/articles/115000146822-%E9%83%A8%E5%88%86%E5%8C%BA%E5%9D%97%E9%93%BE%E8%B5%84%E4%BA%A7%E4%B8%8B%E7%BA%BF%E7%9A%84%E5%85%AC%E5%91%8A, Yuanbao and Dahonghuo have all issued statements to this effect, moving to deactivate markets that trade ICO-derived tokens.  Perhaps most dramatically, BitBays announced that it would stop operating its digital asset exchange entirely, later stating on Twitter that it is shifting its resources to another platform.  ""Due to the new regulatory changes led by China's central bank, the British company BitBays decides to cease operations of its digital asset exchange 'Bi Bei Wang' in China,"" the company said.  CoinDesk reported earlier this week that exchanges that offer ICO services have been moving to return money to select customers, citing the government decision. Signs also indicate that some blockchain projects that have hosted ICOs, including EOS, have moved to distance themselves from China entirely.  Indeed, the situation has led some platform operators to question whether they’ll be able to keep running in the long term.  ""We [are] just waiting for regulators more instructions. If they want to close all ICO platforms, we don't have another choice,"" James Gong, founder of ICOage, told CoinDesk earlier this week.

42379856,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KxHX,1504712411,"DLT Not Ready to Replace Settlement Systems, ECB and BoJ Say","The central banks for Japan and the European Union have published the results of a months-long assessment of distributed ledger tech (DLT).  Launched in December 2016, ""Project Stella"" was aimed at exploring whether a distributed ledger-based system could be used to replace the real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems employed by the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank (ECB). That specific application has been weighed by other central banks, mostly notably the Bank of England, which said earlier this year that it would pass on replacing its RTGS system with blockchain but would make it compatible with the tech.  The 23-page report, published today, ends with a similar conclusion: that, as it stands, the tech shouldn't be used to replace the systems being used by either central bank. That said, the two institutions dubbed the results ""encouraging evidence"" that some degree of application could happen in the future.  As stated in the report:  ""Findings in relation to efficiency show that,with regard to the specific aspects of RTGS services tested to date, a DLT-based solution could meet the performance needs of current large value payment systems.Given the nature of DLT arrangements, in which the process of validating transactions and reaching consensus is more complex than in a centralised system, this is encouraging evidence.""  Among the findings, the report details, were that an increased number of nodes led to an overall increase in the time it takes to settle transactions across the network. Conversely, investigators also noted that ""the distance between validating nodes has an impact on performance"".  Yet an accompanying statement from the central banks ultimately highlights the ""immaturity"" of blockchain for this purpose, and that the question of whether the Bank of Japan or the ECB will one day move to adopt blockchain remains an open one.  ""In conclusion, while the test series produced promising results, it should be taken into account that no direct conclusions can be drawn from the test set-up with respect to a potential usage in production,"" the central banks said, adding:  ""Given the relative immaturity of the technology, DLT is not a solution for large-scale applications like BOJ-NET and TARGET2 at this stage of development.""

Citing the huge volumes of individuals' data being held on databases, and the wave of recent cybercrime attacked worldwide, the state said it plans to protect government-recorded data using WISeKey's blockchain technology. The partnership will see the development of various pilot projects across different departments of the state government, as well as potentially an expansion into other fields such as smart cities.

42379898,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Kxcv,1504706409,"Litecoin Price Retreats From All-Time Highs, But Is $100 in Reach?","The litecoin price [LTC to US dollar exchange rate] surged to an all-time high of over $90 on September 1, taking its year-to-date gains above 2,000 percent.  But while the cryptocurrency was riding high on technological advances, China’s abrupt ICO ban delivered a blow to momentum. Ethereum, bitcoin, bitcoin cash and so on tanked, and litecoin was no exception, dropping more than 15% on Monday to a 5-day low of $64.  Since then, the cryptocurrency seems to have regained poise. Tuesday’s bullish inside day candle has been followed by a rise to $80 levels today.  The development is notable as an inside day candlestick pattern occurs when a security trades within the high and low range of the previous day. It works as a bullish signal if the price action on the following day is positive. On the contrary, a negative price action on the following day is read as a bearish signal.  As per CoinMarketCap, litecoin has seen the third biggest gains among the top 10 cryptocurrencies over the last 24 hours, ranking only below bitcoin cash [up 15.37 percent] and IOTA [up 13.72 percent]. LTC/USD traded at $78 at press time.  Week-on-week, the currency is trading largely unchanged. On a month-on-month basis, LTC is up 75.46%.  What's behind the rally?  Litecoin's rally is best seen not as an isolated event, but part of an increased institutional interest in the cryptocurrencies, triggered by a major rally in bitcoin this year. As it remains best known as the ""silver to bitcoin’s gold,"" the focus of the team behind litecoin has been to promote it as a payment method, especially as bitcoin continues to underperform in this area.  As LTC creator Charlie Lee said recently, ""Litecoin will provide a niche where it will be more used for payment, whereas bitcoin will be more used for storing.""  Yet, while it has a smaller network, with fewer merchants and miners, it's also showing signs its technology is advancing more quickly.  Litecoin was the first major currency to activate a code upgrade called SegWit on May 10, moreover, SegWit activation opened doors for the Lightning Network on litecoin, which would allow for faster and cheaper transactions.  On September 1, Litecoin Foundation tweeted that the first Lightning Network-based litecoin transaction was successful.  Will the rally continue?  In the short-run, everything depends on what bitcoin does next. In the long run, as with all cryptocurrencies, the fate of litecoin depends on how efficiently it creates a niche for itself.  Many are also of the opinion that litecoin acts as a bitcoin-hedge. However, a crash in bitcoin will be a net negative for cryptocurrencies as bitcoin is the gold standard in the nascent market.  Looking ahead, however, there are few signs of stress on technical charts.  Daily chart  Disclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

42421070,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXEhP3,1504703290,Historic Quarter: CoinDesk Launches Q2 State of Blockchain Report,"CoinDesk's Q2 2017 State of Blockchain report summarizes key trends, data and events in the public and enterprise blockchain sectors in the second quarter of 2017.    To download the full State of Blockchain Q2 2017, visit CoinDesk Research.    Q2 at a glance:  Cryptocurrencies hit all-time valuations.  ICOs emerge as an industry force.  The asset class diversifies and bitcoin's total dominance wanes.  1. Crypto prices rally  The story of Q2 begins with a rally that saw the total value of all cryptocurrencies rise to $100 billion, up from $25 billion at the start of the quarter.  Another way to put it is that the total market value of blockchain tokens skyrocketed 4x to an all-time high above $100 billion.  At the same time, industry search queries gathered immense attention, with Google searches for the technology hitting an all-time high in Q2.  2. ICOs emerge as 'killer app'  ICOs helped propel this growth and established a powerful trend in Q2.  The supply of new tokens exploded and crowdfunding and investment returns stunned the world. (To track the escalating funding totals, CoinDesk even went so far as to launch its own dedicated ICO tracker, a free tool that tallies fundraisings via the mechanism).  One useful metric that underlines ICO dominance is how much more successful ICOs were versus traditional VC funding in the blockchain industry.    As part of the State of Blockchain, CoinDesk conducted a sentiment survey designed to leverage the insights of its global readership.  This quarter's survey had over 1,300 respondents, and it served to capture the unease some investors felt as the blockchain use case took off.  In 2017, bitcoin's total domination of the ecosystem shrunk considerably.  At the start of the year, bitcoin represented almost 90% of all the value in cryptocurrencies. By the end of Q2, that number tracked down to almost 41%.  While the market diversified, bitcoin's growth remained impressive with all metrics we track up. Ethereum continued its run with growth across its network as State of Blockchain tracked spikes in transactions, trades, hash rate, block sizes and total distinct addresses.

42379883,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KxP5,1504701028,Ethereum's Raiden Scaling Solution Just Passed Another Milestone,"A test network has been deployed for the Raiden project, a proposed scaling solution for ethereum designed to allow faster payments and lower fees.  Revealed on the Raiden GitHub page yesterday, the testnet is a major milestone for the project, one that will lead to the next phase of development before the code is ready to launch on the live ethereum network.  As with bitcoin, scaling is becoming an issue for the number two cryptocurrency by market capitalization. As more users make more transactions, the amount of traffic has the potential to slow up the network. Compounding the issue is that many ICO tokens are being launched on top of ethereum, bringing in sudden floods of traffic as sales take place.  Raiden – which has been in discussion since 2015 – is one part of ethereum's solution to that problem. Inspired by bitcoin's Lightning Network, the technology would shift the majority of transactions off of the ethereum blockchain to create an alternate network of peer-to-peer payment channels.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, the network is intended to massively increase transaction speeds, potentially enabling over a million transactions per second.  Raiden also accommodates the exchange of tokens and features an API to facilitate interactions with decentralized applications.  Reactions to the news of the testnet on Reddit were generally positive, though some raised the specter of centralization, with Raiden being likely to operate via payment hubs. Others responded that institutions are most likely to require the transaction throughput of off-chain payments, and that most private transactions would remain on-chain.

In seemingly off-the-cuff remarks at a panel discussion in New York on Tuesday, SEC co-director Steven Peikin claimed that such sales could pose a threat to retail investors, a problem which the SEC is now trying to address according to Reuters.  Most notably, he compared those seeking to leverage the blockchain use case improperly to cockroaches.  Peikin reportedly told attendees:  ""As with any kind of newsworthy event, roaches kind of crawl out of the woodwork and try to scam money off of investors.""  The comments follow an escalation of regulatory announcements on ICOs, with the SEC recently ruling tokens may be be classified as securities (though such decisions are being made case-by-case). Since then, Canada, China and Hong Kong have followed suit, with only China taking aggressive steps to ban ICOs altogether.  On the heels of those announcements, the SEC is said to be targeting bad actors in the space, with Peikin indicating this responsibility has fallen to the agency's distributed ledger technology group, launched in 2013.  In recent weeks, that group has taken action against ICOs still in development, with the SEC putting a particular emphasis on publicly traded companies. Various other SEC investigations on fraudulent ICOs are underway, Peikin reportedly stated.

42379887,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KxU7,1504692030,Is Blockchain Ready for Fiat? Why Banks See Big Promise in Crypto Cash,"Central banks could soon see a wave of technological breakthroughs – that is, if the newest members of the Utility Settlement Coin (USC) project have anything to say about it.  Initially designed as a way to minimize the role of clearinghouses by letting financial institutions pay each other directly using collateral-backed crypto tokens, the implications of the work could have a broad impact. Since the collateral associated with those tokens is to be held by central banks, the project is increasingly being seen as a step toward reimagining how fiat currency could be issued.  But the potential improvements go far beyond faster transactions with less risk to counterparties, according to several members of the consortium.  If both an asset and the currency used to pay for it are issued on a blockchain, entirely new financial products could result, they argue.  Lee Braine of the Barclays investment bank told CoinDesk:  ""By focusing on new collateralized digital currencies linked to major fiat currencies, the Utility Settlement Coin project could potentially create new asset-backed regulated digital cash instruments on distributed ledger technology.""  Echoing Braine's enthusiasm was the head of blockchain research and development at Banco Santander, Julio Faura.  In interview with CoinDesk, Faura framed the benefits another way, emphasizing the power of using distributed ledgers to run encrypted, self-executing agreements:  ""The idea of having a fiat-backed proxy of central bank money issued on smart contacts for financial institutions to exchange liquidity globally seems a very powerful concept,"" he said.  Eliminating risk  The idea of central banks issuing fiat currency on a blockchain also has the attention of Emmanuel Aidoo, the head of Credit Suisse's distributed ledger and blockchain program, who says the change could do more than streamline post-trade processing.  Aidoo said he'd been monitoring the USC for 18 months before concluding that the time was right for his bank to get involved. Indeed, it was his belief that the project could impact financial stability on the largest economic scale, that eventually led him to ""help drive momentum"" for its support.  He told CoinDesk:  ""The applications of USC extend beyond payments, and could ultimately optimize efficiencies in margin and collateral obligations and reduce systemic risk.""  Already, central banks around the world are exploring how blockchain technology could assist in a wide range of applications.  Central to such large-scale, diverse promise, is the ability to minimize risk between each of the individual counterparties involved in an agreement.  For example, currently, there's substantial risk in an exchange process called ""delivery versus payment,"" which is designed to ensure securities are only moved down the value chain at as close to the moment of payment as possible, minimizing possible exposure to loss due to sudden changes in price.  Another new USC member, digital product manager of cash solutions at State Street bank, Swen Werner, said that ""ensuring the settlement of financial instruments follows a strict delivery-versus-payment process is of critical importance to the industry and the success of new distributed ledger solutions.""  Similarly, the head of fintech partnerships and strategy at HSBC, Kaushalya Somasundaram, explained how the solution developed with the help of blockchain startup Clearmatics, could help reduce the number of times such risky exchanges occur.  ""It would be a lot more efficient to actually link up the digital currency to the central bank collateral and to be able to transfer the digital currency across,"" she said. ""Ensuring the cash fungibility happens at once across all the legs of the transaction, and not multiple times, across each leg in a sequential manner.""  Pushing interoperability  Currently, the USC platform is being designed so that the value of the token is derived from collateral stored by Utility Settlement Coin members in central banks – but use of the platform itself is not contingent on central bank adoption.  However, as with any distributed ledger technology, the solution can only be only as powerful as the number of parties who adopt it. At every point of exchange between a blockchain-based asset and a centralized asset the element of risk increases, minimizing the potential benefits of a partial implementation, according to Hyder Jaffrey, the head of strategic investment and fintech innovation at UBS.  In order to minimize those vulnerabilities, Jaffrey joins many of his fellow USC members in his belief that fiat currency issued on a blockchain is essential. To help increase the chances that adoption occurs, several members said they aim to leverage their membership as a way to engage directly with central banks.  ""In order to see the benefits on-ledger, you really need the breadth of [central bank currencies] available in similar time frames,” he said.  Still, he concluded with a cautious afterthought:  ""That's probably going to be some time before we see that.""

As CoinDesk reported in June, the General Services Administration (GSA) is in the early stages of developing a blockchain prototype that could one day replace FAStlane, a procurement system dedicated to IT projects. The initiative forms part of a wider bid within the GSA to investigate distributed ledger use cases, which itself constitutes one part of the U.S. government's wider blockchain effort.  Speaking with public sector IT website MeriTalk, Jose Arrieta, a director within the GSA's Federal Acquisition Service who oversees work on IT procurements, struck a bullish tone on the tech's prospects as it relates to the acquisitions process. He said that work continues on the FAStlane prototype, pointing to September 30 as a milestone in the proof-of-concept process.  Perhaps most notably, he suggested that approvals – which can take as long as a month, if not more – could happen in a matter of days should the tech be more widely implemented.  ""The single most important thing about blockchain is that it creates transparency and accuracy between two entities,"" he told the publication, adding:  ""We believe with blockchain we might be able to reduce the number of days to single digits.""  Part of the equation, according to Arrietta, is the ability to ""sew together"" the different parts of the IT procurement process, with the idea being that different parts of that system can communicate with one another more effectively.

Far from imposing penalties and refunds, Quebec's regulator for financial institutions, the Autorite des marches financiers (AMF), is seeking to better understand the blockchain use case – if not altogether encourage it. In fact, the AMF has not only determined that a token sale by Impak Finance, a platform for investing in socially responsible enterprises, is a security, it has gone so far as to accept the company into its regulatory sandbox.  With the news, Impak Coin becomes the first project to launch in the AMF's sandbox, announced earlier this year, and the first regulated ICO based in Canada.  Most notably, however, the AMF is also showing a willingness to bend certain rules for the sale, relieving Impak from several requirements securities issuers would normally be subjected to for investor protection purposes.  And according to Patrick Theoret, a director in AMF's corporate finance division, the regulator believes that's the best strategy for approaching new and novel tech.  He told CoinDesk:  ""It’s in the spirit of the sandbox that we are willing to alleviate some of the requirements on, sort of, a test case basis. It's a test run to see whether there are investor protection [issues] with the relief that we grant.""  Looking ahead, AMF will serve as the principal regulator to the token, and Canada's other provinces and territories will honor the decision via the Canadian securities passport system, which allows the startup access to all markets in the country while only complying with their principal regulator.  Catching up  Announced earlier this year by the Canadian Securities Administration – a consortium of provincial securities regulators – the sandbox is meant to jumpstart fintech projects that don't easily fit within the confines of a legacy framework. And ICOs, a nascent fundraising mechanism by which new cryptocurrencies are created and sold to investors, fit this definition.  In this light, Paul Allard, president of Impak, said the decision to participate in the sandbox was straightforward.  ""I had been working with the regulators for several years prior to Impak Coin, and I knew that they were keen in adapting their regulatory framework to catch up with the cryptocurrency sector,"" he said.  But the decision was also a necessity since AMF determined Impak Coin – which will be used to power Impak's platform – met its definition of a security. Specifically, it's a contract in which there is an investment in a common enterprise with the expectation of profit on the efforts of others.  Yet, as this ruling could come down on other ICO projects in the country in the future, AMF representatives said Impak Coin is serving as a de-facto test for a new kind of business onramp.  Granting relief  But while impactful for regulators, it's the relief granted to Impak that might be most notable for innovators and entrepreneurs.  Firstly, Impak will not have to register as a securities dealer, provided certain terms and conditions – such as know-your-customer screenings – are met, according to Sophie Jean, director of supervision of intermediaries at AMF.  Plus, because of its categorization as a security, the token distribution is supposed to come with a prospectus – a printed document describing a commercial enterprise in order to inform investors – but the AMF waived that requirement also, Jean said.  So far, Impak's token has been approved as a test case for a two-year window, after which, the stakeholders will reconvene and decide how best to proceed with Impak and future ICO projects.  Theoret emphasized that, in the absence of any investor complaints or problems, the agency would be willing to potentially extend the relief on a more permanent basis, stating:  ""If nobody has made a complaint [asserting] that they weren’t protected enough in the sense of the securities and regulatory environment, then we’ll consider granting permanent relief to the filer. Or, if we have [multiple proposals] of a similar nature, then maybe we can consider permanent regulatory amendments so that our regulations are changed to permit this.""  Learning by doing  AMF officials further emphasized that working through the regulatory sandbox approval process was critical because it enabled them to better understand a business model much different than what they're accustomed to seeing.  Jean explained that while it's a ""traditional ICO"" in the sense that there's a white paper and a new cryptocurrency, the regulator didn't have a past precedent for the filing.  ""This was very, very novel because we had to apply the principles of regulation to the filer and provide the filer with a tailor-made order providing terms and conditions for the distribution of the digital currency,"" she said.  In this way, officials from AMF see their work with Impak as in line with guidance issued by CSA on August 24, which attempts to clarify the circumstances under which a token will be considered a security. Both developments, they said, send a signal about how Canada is responding to the potential promise of blockchain technology.  More crucially, though, they also help bridge two communities who some have sought to portray as at odds.  Theoret concluded:  ""A lot of these startups and blockchain-type companies might not have the level of sophistication in securities law to understand all these ramifications. It’s meant for everybody to take notice. Don’t forget about securities laws if you're endeavoring a project.""

Heading into Wednesday's trading session, the value of all publicly traded cryptocurrencies was once again on the rise, climbing 17% from a low of $134 billion observed Tuesday. At press time, this figure had recovered to $157 billion, a gain of over $20 billion in just 24 hours.  Showcasing the extent of the rally, all top-10 cryptocurrencies were displaying double-digit gains at time of publication, with litecoin, iota and monero seeing the biggest increases.  Such market movements are notable as they come just a day after an announcement from China's financial regulators that initial coin offerings (ICOs), or the sale of new cryptocurrencies to fund blockchain project development, had been deemed illegal.  Assets including bitcoin and ether, the currencies of choice in most sales, declined on the news. However, the short-lived drop suggests a bullishness in the market remains.  Most telling is that a similar increase was observed in the market for crypto assets, which saw its total investment recover to $8.5 billion, up nearly 20% from a low of $7 billion just a day before, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  Indeed, some of the largest ICO tokens already appear to be recovering investment dollars, with OmiseGo rebounding above the $1 billion mark after declining to a low of $718 million on the news.
