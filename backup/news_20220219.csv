The blockchain-cryptocurrency sector is a little more than a decade old and still fighting an uphill battle for widespread acceptance. Those who have closely followed the industry&apos;s rise know its potential to solve the biggest problems plaguing legacy financial systems, but before crypto can go truly mainstream, it must first reckon with some of its own inherent shortcomings. For starters, crypto-based transactions are considerably slower than conventional payments, with the exception of some cross-border use cases. Faster transactions are possible, but not without a hefty price tag out of reach for many users. This sluggish speed often means long waits for transactions to settle, resulting in network congestion. As we witnessed with CryptoKitties in 2017, scalability is a serious concern for existing blockchains and protocols running on them. Beyond these technical limitations, myths and misunderstandings abound in the blockchain-cryptocurrency domain, which presents significant obstacles to onboarding. Those skeptical about cryptocurrencies often perceive it as &apos;magic internet money&apos; with little or no value in the real world, or worse, a means for criminals to transact shady business outside of the watchful eye of financial regulators.

Other names for the blockchain gaming industry include GameFi and play-to-earn, which refer to the new monetization strategies that have emerged in this era of gaming. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or other tokenized assets are commonly used in blockchain gaming and traded for cryptocurrencies on blockchain-facilitated exchanges. As a result, sales of tokenized assets and subsequent royalty proceeds represent the key monetization strategy. In this new business model, game creators and players have aligned motivations because both gains as the game&apos;s tokenized assets increase in value. The idea is that gamers should own the content they earn, or at the very least, have more ownership in the digital environments in which they spend a considerable amount of their time and money.

It ranks as the third amongst all NFT markets, with OpenSea leading at $100 million. Tiffany Huang, a former Marriott International Asia Pacific Brand Director, joined Magic Eden in early October to oversee marketing. The Budding Growth of NFTs According to Huang, one of the major challenges in carrying out the purpose of supporting the Web3 community is that NFTs are still in the nascent stage. Particularly when it comes to onboarding women into the crypto space. Huang mentioned that just last week, she spent over an hour with a young acquaintance, elucidating how to receive an NFT to her. Huang realized how difficult it is to navigate through the procedure alone. From obtaining a Phantom wallet and Twitter account to using an index such as HowRareIs to shop an NFT, and finally joining discord for verification. &apos;I think the challenge to getting more people into space is that NFTs are really nascent. Men are in certain communities like gaming or in subcultures that enable them to get in faster and assimilate into the NFT culture. However, for women, it&apos;s a taller order,&apos; says Huang.

UAE Plans to Issue Crypto Licenses Next Quarter According to a Bloomberg report, the UAE Securities and Commodities Authority is planning to issue federal licenses to virtual asset service providers (VASPs) by the end of the first quarter. The securities regulator is already in the final stage of setting up a framework that would allow crypto companies to set up their base in the region. Such a nationwide crypto licensing regulation would help the region become a global leader in crypto-friendly jurisdictions. The regulators reportedly considered the guidelines of the Financial Action Task Force as well as regulatory strategies used in the United States, United Kingdom, and Singapore for framing its crypto license legislation. The new crypto regulation would reportedly take a hybrid approach where the chief regulatory body SCA will regulate the crypto industry with input from the central bank while local financial centres can develop their own licensing guidelines. Apart from crypto licenses, the government of the UAE is also planning on regulating the crypto mining industry.

However, the THETA cryptocurrency organized its fall wave even when it was not mainstream. After setting historical highs in April 2021, buyers decided to give up the global initiative and watch from the sidelines. It is from April 2021 on the weekly timeframe that can find a strong and stable downward trend. Though, while the global range of $4.38 was under the control of buyers - investors were not particularly concerned. In fact, this mark repulsed 4 attacks by sellers in 8 months. But, the 5th sellers&apos; attack hit the $4.38 range and lowered the THETA price by 40%. https://www.tradingview.com/x/VqXT3bGX/ However, there is a positive moment in this action. After the breakdown of $4.38 in mid-January, trading volumes in the THETA market increased significantly. Before this breakdown, such volumes in the weekly timeframe were rare and only in places of global price reversal. The increase in trading volumes at local highs indicates the probable beginning of a reversal of the fall. Though, are buyers ready to start active growth right now? On the weekly timeframe, you can see an attempt by buyers to take control of the $4.38 range. The result is two weekly candles with pins up.

In an interview Friday at the ETHDenver conference, Buterin, who grew up in Canada, did not condone the ""freedom convoys"" that have been blaring their horns in Ottawa for the last week in opposition to COVID-19 restrictions.  ""If the truckers are blocking the roads and that's breaking the economy, fine, blocking the roads is illegal and there are laws against that,"" he told CoinDesk TV anchor Christine Lee.  But he described the government's response as heavy-handed, and crypto as a potential check on such overreach.  ""If the government is not willing to follow the laws ... [and] give people a chance to defend themselves ... and they just want to talk to the banks and basically cut out people's financial livelihoods without due process, that is an example of the sort of thing that decentralized technology is there to make more difficult,"" Buterin said.  In this way, crypto is not so much a radical technology as a restorative one, he argued.  ""It's not about being lawless. In some ways, it's about bringing rule of law back,"" Buterin said. Governments and police can still act lawfully and pursue suspects ""as they always have"" without conscripting financial middlemen, he said.  ""This concept of going after intermediaries and using intermediaries to bypass all that, it is dangerous,"" Buterin said. ""Having decentralized alternatives to an intermediary is a good way to limit the damage.""  This week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government invoked never-used emergency powers in an effort to quash the protests. Banks and other financial service providers were authorized to freeze or suspend accounts associated with the trucker convoy without a court order and were shielded from civil liability for doing so.  Supporters of the truckers have tried to circumvent the blockades by raising cryptocurrency donations. The government has blacklisted a number of crypto addresses associated with these efforts, and a court injunction ordered the funds frozen pending the outcome of a private class action law suit. It remains to be seen how effective these measures will be because crypto transactions cannot be vetoed, and wallets are controlled by whoever possesses the cryptographic private keys.  On the other hand, to use the funds to buy food or gasoline, the recipients would likely need to convert the crypto into fiat currency, which usually requires going through a regulated exchange subject to the government's directives.  During the sit-down with CoinDesk's Lee, Buterin also discussed Ethereum's challenges, gas fees, ETH inflation and competition Ethereum faces from newer layer 1 blockchains.
