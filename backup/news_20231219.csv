21604674,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=565982,1703026815,"Matrixport Says 95% Chance Of Bitcoin Spot ETF In January, Sets BTC Price Target","The anticipation around a potential approval of a Spot Bitcoin ETF is still high among crypto investors. This anticipation has been one of the main drivers of the price rally that has been witnessed over the last two months. Despite the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) postponing its decision on multiple spot ETF filings, industry experts remain very positive that the regulator is on the verge of approving the first Spot Bitcoin ETF. Bitcoin Spot ETF Coming In January 2024 Many experts have revised their expectations for if and when the SEC would approve a Spot Bitcoin ETF. At first, expectations were low. But as time has gone on, the expectations have risen quickly and analysts at Matrixport are part of the camp that believes a Spot Bitcoin ETF is on its way. Related Reading: Crypto Founder Predicts XRP Price Will Hit $22, Here’s When In a report released on Monday, December 18, Matrixport Head of Research Markus Thielen reveals a 95% chance that a Spot BTC ETF will be approved in January 2024. January carries the deadline dates for most of the 13 filings so far, and Thielen expects that the SEC will approve a spot ETF on January 10. The report points to the fact that BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, reviewed its S-1 filing with the SEC. Here, the regulator had given the asset manager instructions which included monitoring unusual price movements, storing all private keys in cold storage, and having procedures in the event there are Bitcoin forks. Additionally, the SEC also responded to Franklin-Templeton’s filing in November despite having until January to do so. This move, the analyst says, “gave the impression that the SEC is lining all issuers up to get approval by January 10, 2024.” Thielen explains the importance of the meeting the regulator had with BlackRock, saying, “The SEC has never actively engaged with potential ETF issues and appears to have given all ETF issuers with whom it had discussions the same instructions.” BTC price shows high level of volatility | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com BTC Price Expectations After Approvals Given that Matrixport expects approvals to come in January, the analyst also gave their expectation for price when this happens. Thielen expects that Bitcoin will go on another rally once this happens and the price could rise as high as $50,000 in the first quarter of the year 2024 as a result. Related Reading: Dogecoin On-Chain Metrics Explode, Can DOGE Price Reach $0.2? “We expect this correction to switch back into another leg higher in Bitcoin prices after Christmas as investors take advantage of the recent correction and position themselves for the likely Bitcoin Spot ETF approval period – January 8 to January 10, 2024,” the analyst said, alluding to the decline in price that Bitcoin has recorded over the last week. As for Grayscale, the analyst doesn’t believe that the SEC would allow for a conversion of the Bitcoin trust into a Spot ETF on January 10. However, they do expect 20% of precious metal demand to switch to Spot Bitcoin ETFs following the approvals.

Van de Poppe has now set his sights on new heights for the flagship cryptocurrency. In a recent post, the analyst expressed confidence that Bitcoin has concluded its corrective phase and is primed to test the $47,000-$50,000 range soon. Van de Poppe’s optimism stems from a critical market development: the potential approval of spot BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF) by major financial entities like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark Investment. This anticipated move, widely supported by industry experts, could catalyze BTC’s leap.

Ali, another market analyst, has raised concerns over Bitcoin’s recent slip below a crucial supply zone, ranging from $41,200 to $42,400. Leveraging on-chain data from IntoTheBlock, Ali pointed out that this zone is a stronghold for 1.87 million addresses, cumulatively holding around 730,000 BTC. He warns that a breach below this level could trigger a sell-off, potentially pushing Bitcoin down to the next demand zone between $37,500 and $38,700. #Bitcoin has slipped below a key supply zone, ranging from $41,200 to $42,400. In this area, 1.87 million addresses had accumulated 730,000 $BTC. This downturn might trigger these holders to sell, aiming to cut losses. If selling pressure increases, watch for a possible decline… pic.twitter.com/aTX1RWarkb — Ali (@ali_charts) December 18, 2023 However, in a positive twist, Bitcoin has shown signs of recovery, surpassing the $42,400 mark. In the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has witnessed a near 3% rise, trading around $42,548 at the time of writing. This resurgence is a strong indicator that Bitcoin has re-entered and solidified its position in the critical supply zone identified by Ali. Bitcoin Path To $200,000 By 2024 Beyond these immediate forecasts, Dan Tapiero, Managing Partner at 10T Holdings, envisions a broader transformation for Bitcoin and the crypto market. Tapiero, echoing insights from Real Vision’s CEO Raoul Paul, predicts that BTC could surge to over $200,000 by May 2024. This bullish trajectory is not just mere speculation. Still, it is backed by the anticipation of a significant liquidity influx into the BTC market, especially with the potential SEC approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Introducing these spot ETFs, especially from traditional finance stalwarts like BlackRock, is poised to be a game-changer. It offers institutional investors a regulated avenue to dive into BTC, thereby enhancing the coin’s liquidity and, consequently, its market value.

Dogecoin Whales Have Made Many Moves During The Last 24 Hours According to data from the cryptocurrency transaction tracker Whale Alert, a few large DOGE moves have been spotted on the blockchain during the past 24 hours. All four of these transfers are on the scale of millions in USD, suggesting that whale entities may have been behind them. The whales refer to the largest investors in the sector, who can hold some influence due to the size of their holdings. Related Reading: Santiment Breaks Down “Most Trending” Altcoins Of Past Week Because of this reason, transfers from this cohort can be something to keep an eye on. How a whale moves could affect the market depends on what the whale intends to achieve with it. Generally, it’s hard to say with certainty about such a motive, but depending on the types of wallets involved and the direction of the coins’ flow, some hints can be gathered. The two oldest transfers from the past day involved the movement of $5.1 million and $7.5 million worth of Dogecoin to the Robinhood platform. Below are the details for the older of the two transactions. Looks like the transaction needed a fee of just $0.41 to go through | Source: Whale Alert As is visible, an unknown wallet was the sender of the transaction. Such wallets are unattached to any known centralized platform and will likely be investors’ self-custodial addresses. When an investor shifts their coins from their wallets to exchanges, there is always a possibility the move has been made for selling purposes. As such, this deposit from the whale could be bearish for DOGE. The same would go for the other Robinhood deposit from the past day. Besides these two deposits, there has been one more exchange inflow transaction in this same window to the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. The Coinbase DOGE deposit from today | Source: Whale Alert This $5.9 million deposit comes after Dogecoin recovered from its recent lows, so the whale may be looking to sell while some gains remain. The final transaction from the last 24 hours is the largest of the four, as it has seen DOGE worth a whopping $41.5 million shift across the network. However, this transfer is unremarkable because only unknown addresses have been involved in it. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crash To $38,000: Here’s What Could Trigger It It’s hard to say what this transaction was made for, as it could be anything from a peer-to-peer (P2P) transfer to a simple change of wallets.

42409157,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcEJLN,1703017045,7 Predictions About the Crypto Lending Landscape in 2024,"As bitcoin begins another ascent upwards, competition among existing crypto lenders will continue apace. That means more innovation in lending products and offerings, as new market entrants from traditional finance and crypto look to take a piece of this high-demand industry as well as risks. Much of the market turmoil during the last bear market was caused by bankruptcies and business failures of overextended or otherwise shady crypto lenders.  This post is part of CoinDesk's ""Crypto 2024"" predictions package. Mauricio is the co-founder of Ledn.  But the rebirth of the crypto lending market will also bring exciting opportunities for end users and investors alike, and drive continued changes to the digital lending ecosystem as we currently know it. Here are my seven key things to consider for the year ahead:  Beware the rise of overnight lenders  As more users enter the space, old and new companies alike will try to fill the void left by now-defunct crypto lenders like Genesis, Voyager, BlockFi and Celsius. They will try to sell customers the same promises of high returns with little transparency or risk management, as previous failed lenders did. There will be more fly-by-night opportunists trying to enter the market and trying to capture share.  As prices soar, don’t forget to ask the right questions! Was the lender able to navigate 2022 without hiccups? Are they “new” to the space? Investors should carefully understand how yield is generated, demand proof that the lender is accounting for client assets properly, and closely examine their risk management policies and track records. If you’re not getting clear disclosures or answers — beware!  Volumes will concentrate around regulated venues  Bitcoin [BTC] and ether [ETH] spot trading and derivatives volumes will shift from unregulated venues to regulated ones. Until now, a material share of the trading volume in crypto was processed through unregulated platforms that many times did not conduct KYC [know your customer checks] like decentralized exchanges and P2P markets. With the introduction of regulatory clarity and the emergence of spot bitcoin ETFs, a lot of this volume will now shift to regulated venues as traditional finance participants get the necessary clarity to become active in these markets.  See also: What's All the Fuss About Bitcoin ETFs?  Said differently, spot volume will move from decentralized exchanges like Uniswap to venues like Coinbase and Kraken while derivatives volumes like options and futures will move from overseas exchanges like Binance and ByBit to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange for ETFs.  Arbitrage opportunities in bitcoin ETFs  The approval of spot bitcoin ETFs will lead to a massive expansion in the bitcoin lending markets, as traditional finance and crypto market-makers alike will be able to arbitrage price differences between various investment vehicles as well as spot BTC prices. Until recently, some of the larger TradFi market makers had not participated in crypto or bitcoin because the arbitrage opportunities necessitated them getting involved in unregulated venues.  With spot bitcoin ETFs available in places like Nasdaq, bitcoin derivative products in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and spot bitcoin in regulated exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken, institutions now have all the tools they need to make markets. They will need one more thing — physical bitcoin inventory.  Those of us who actively participate in the bitcoin lending markets are already starting to see this effect. This evolution will not only enhance the attractiveness of bitcoin lending as an investment option, but also legitimize and contribute to the overall stability of the digital asset market.  The comeback of crypto debit cards  We are likely to see a resurgence of crypto debit cards thanks to increasing regulatory clarity and the continued efforts of reputable and well-established industry players. Specifically, Visa, Mastercard and Circle have been investing relentlessly in solutions that are increasingly more integrated with crypto platforms and digital assets.  These solutions blur the lines between digital assets and traditional payment rails, allowing users to spend their holdings directly without the need to convert into fiat currency.  Investors will demand faster, cheaper transactions  As the bull market gains momentum, the escalating transaction fees will likely fuel the growth of layer 2 solutions and more efficient blockchains (as it usually does during bull market cycles). Innovations like Lightning Network for Bitcoin and scaling solutions like Polygon for Ethereum are prime examples of technologies designed to enable faster and cheaper transactions.  High-throughput blockchains like Tron and Solana will also grow in popularity. I expect these ecosystems to mature and gain wider acceptance. This evolution will create a lot of opportunity both in terms of future product innovation and investment.  The growing demand for stablecoins  The stablecoin market will grow significantly, I project that the total supply could surpass $250 billion. Tether, in particular, is expected to maintain dominance, controlling over 50% of the market share due to its widespread adoption across the globe. The growth of this market reflects the increasing demand for digital assets that combine the benefits of cryptocurrency with the stability of the U.S. dollar.  See also: Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino: The Hardest Working Man in Crypto  Governments will try to compete with these with their own central bank digital currencies, but I don’t expect CDBCs to get the “warm welcome” governments want. Several attempts have already been rejected by citizens in places like Nigeria and the Bahamas, and I expect this to be a trend that continues.  Increased DeFi oversight  This bull cycle will be markedly different from its predecessors, primarily due to the anticipated increase in oversight in previously unregulated markets like decentralized exchanges and lending platforms. Financial regulators worldwide are fully aware of the growing significance and volumes flowing through platforms that do not know who their customers are. Many of these platforms have fully centralized operating teams and will fall victim to regulatory requirements.  In practice, all of this will result in authorities making an example from a few DeFi projects. This aggressive stance will likely create ""DeFi martyrs"" who will bear the brunt of this crackdown. Once these nomially “decentralized” platforms have to start conducting KYC and following regulations, the volume will dry up by moving to fully regulated venues or truly unregulated venues.  This next bull run is not just about financial growth and innovation; it's also about the industry's maturation.

42409167,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcEJp8,1703015891,How Asia Drives the Next Crypto Bull Market,"We have arrived at the start of the next bull market. If history is our guide, these cycles are powered by multiple factors including Bitcoin's halving events, shifts in macroeconomic landscapes around U.S. elections and Federal Reserve interest rates, as well as the advent of new Web3 and DeFi innovations. Yield farming, for instance, was a significant innovation that fueled the previous cycle. The upcoming cycle may potentially feature a mix of zero-knowledge proofs, novel DeFi primitives like restaking, and innovative blockchain stacks that offer modularity, composability, and are primed for interchain asset and data movement.  This post is part of CoinDesk's ""Crypto 2024"" predictions package.   Each cycle is accompanied by a unique cultural narrative. The last cycle was dominated by art NFTs, sparked by Beeple's $69 million sale at Christie’s, and further fueled by the PFP craze and the fine arts use case growing with proponents at the scale of Sotheby’s and Pace Gallery. The present cycle, predictions suggest, will be molded by the SocialFi narrative, as platforms like Friend.Tech have already set the stage.  Institutional and regulatory narratives, too, play a crucial role. The last cycle saw MicroStrategy's Michael Saylor introducing Bitcoin to the corporate balance sheet, while this cycle is marked by traditional financial institutions and fintech giants applying for crypto ETFs and launching stablecoins.  On the regulatory front, the U.S. is still wrestling with crypto regulations, causing many projects to market their new crypto products outside the U.S. This is why I argue that the next bull market will have a distinct geographical flavor, with Asia taking center stage.  The enthusiasm for crypto in Asia is hard to miss. A stark contrast was visible between less vibrant fall conferences in the States and the buzzing scenes at Korea Blockchain Week and Token2049 in Singapore. Cities like Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City, Jakarta, Manila, and Kuala Lumpur, not to mention a handful of large Indian cities, are home to substantial developer communities and flourishing Web3 scenes, bolstered by government support and enterprise adoption. The thriving environment at Token2049, in Singapore, the real capital being deployed by APAC investors into crypto projects, and the increasing appetite for NFTs collectively suggest a region primed to drive the next bull market.

While Asian governments vie for the top spot as a crypto hub, the U.S. seems to discourage its crypto entrepreneurs. As a result, marketing campaigns are excluding the U.S., businesses are expanding in Asia, Europe, and the Middle East to cater to growing demand, and entrepreneurs are relocating to jurisdictions with a friendlier regulatory environment.  Opening Serotonin offices in APAC, I've witnessed firsthand the unique advantages these markets offer to growing crypto projects. From tech-savvy, mobile-first audiences to high-quality developers eager to contribute to decentralized projects, the region is brimming with potential. There's a palpable enthusiasm for Web3 culture and a readiness to adopt new technologies, particularly SocialFi, which is already the norm in the region, thanks to exposure to WeChat. (SocialFi refers to applications allowing users to monetize social interactions and control their own data.)  Telegram, ubiquitously used for messaging by the Web3 community in Asia, is already testing out its self-custody crypto wallet in-app with non-U.S. users. Combining this with the regulatory friendliness of places like Hong Kong and Singapore, we are looking at a potentially explosive crypto boom. To us Americans, it feels borderline unimaginable that First Digital in Hong Kong, for example, could launch its stablecoin, FDUSD, with regulatory approval, when fintech mainstays like PayPal face subpoenas for doing the same in the US.  This ""Asia speed,"" as we at Serotonin affectionately term it, is a testament to the region's rapid adoption and contribution to Web3 technologies. I believe this dynamic will steer the upcoming bull market and introduce a geographical narrative to the crypto cycle.  However, I foresee this scenario changing in about 18 months, post the next U.S. election. I expect regulatory clarity for crypto in the U.S. to emerge, sparking a new cycle of enterprise adoption and marketing to U.S. consumers. This period will also see the re-emergence of the U.S. as a primary driver of Web3 innovation and adoption, contributing to a thriving global Web3 ecosystem, with leadership from Asia and other markets.  In the meantime, our strategy is to use this time to grow our business with a focus on Asia. We're facilitating Western projects' entry into Asian markets, forming partnerships with Eastern-originated projects to go global, and connecting with English-speakers in Europe and the Middle East. All things considered, the crypto world is set for a more diverse and dynamic era driven by various global forces, with Asia leading the charge in the imminent bull cycle.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Amanda Cassatt,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/12/19/how-asia-drives-the-next-crypto-bull-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7c6962420f7f340243ea1bc484f6a6b74d69a49c-3944x2630.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409156,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcEJEl,1703015637,The Bitcoin Fee Flippening Is Upon Us,"When people hear the two words “smart contract” they tend to think immediately of DAOs, DEX’s, and NFTs largely found on Ethereum. But that's about to change. In 2024, we can expect Bitcoin to take the lead in drawing developers to build on the network due to superior security founded in its proof-of-work consensus method and a fee model that is designed to effectively incentivize network contributors now through eternity.  This post is part of CoinDesk's ""Crypto 2024"" predictions package. Taras Kulyk is the founder and CEO of SunnySide Digital.  In contrast, Ethereum zealots have been predicting that ether [ETH] will overtake bitcoin [BTC] in market cap for years, but it's now apparent these forecasts are not coming true. ETH is now down almost 30% in relative market cap versus BTC. Ironically, the only flippening likely to happen is a migration of Ethereum use cases transitioning to the Bitcoin protocol. (Even with puritanical Maxi Bitcoiners like Luke Dashjr up in arms about it.)  Proof-of-stake: The death knell for Ethereum  When Ethereum switched to proof-of-stake (PoS), it set the course for its gradual and inevitable obsolescence. In contrast to proof-of-work (PoW), which takes into account the physics and engineering of energy consumption, staking implements a sort of “voting” system to approve the next correct state of the chain. The more crypto you have, the greater weight your votes have.  Essentially, PoS is a replication of everything that’s wrong with our current financial system where the ""haves"" obtain greater power over the ""have nots"" or ""have littles"" — except it’s on a blockchain.  What’s more, if measured under the same 51% attack threat model as PoW, PoS is fundamentally, and fatally, insecure. This is anathema to the cypherpunk vision and it should be condemned. A system built on constant hard forks is bound to make network participants weary of the potential unforeseen implications of each upgrade.  See also: Casey Rodarmor: The Bitcoin Artist | Most Influential 2023  You could say Ethereum was misguided from the beginning, ever since the Ethereum Foundation created a 70% premine to pay themselves. This move set the course for the powerful to control the network, and it becomes blatantly obvious that Ethereum is destined to fail, even from a regulatory standpoint if it comes down to that. It’s quipped that if the Securities and Exchange Commisson (SEC) calls and someone is on the other end to answer, it's centralized.  It’s also true that Ethereum has had a certain level of past success in fee generation and more expressive use cases like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and meme coins. Yet when we compare the slow and steady march of Bitcoin in these categories, it is also clear that Ethereum is losing the battle. And, of course, the markets don't lie.  Fee fi fo FUD  One key topic of FUD [fear, uncertainty and doubt] regarding Bitcoin is its long term security model. Mainly, that there won’t be sufficient fees to incentivize miners to continue mining blocks over time as the block subsidy reduces asymptotically until some time in the 2100s. This argument went out the door this year. Multiple times, we have seen transaction fee rewards outperform mining subsidies and just this past week, we saw fees double the block reward. And we’re still early in the overall halving schedule of BTC as a protocol.  Inscriptions, whether you hate them or love them, have helped jumpstart a fee war, comprising 21% of all fees year to date.  While it’s true that inscriptions have helped ignite a competitive transaction fee environment (the peak of the Inscription craze in May was $18M), regular daily transaction fees have amounted to $13 million. Even the meme coin mania previously seen on Ethereum has migrated over to Bitcoin. Back in May, BRC-20 — a new token standard using the Ordinals protocol — brought bitcoin transaction fees to its highest level in two years at the time.  It must be again mentioned that some purists of the “transaction purpose” Bitcoin network view this activity as spam on the network as its only “true” utility is in propagating only BTC transaction data. As a mining sector participant, I think it’s naive to believe that the market won’t push a technology to the one that is supported and adopted by the most users. Providing a truly sustainable economic model to support the mining industry into perpetuity is the right outcome.  This year, Bitcoin was a gravitational force in bringing NFT enthusiasts over from Ethereum and other L1s thanks to Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens. Once heralded as one of the preeminent use cases for Ethereum and a competitive edge, NFTs on Ethereum have begun a slow descent. For instance, the largest NFT platform on Ethereum, OpenSea, is down 98.5% in volume since its highs. In comparison, Ordinals drove adoption of Bitcoin NFTs.  In fact, Galaxy Research estimates that the market size of Bitcoin NFTs will reach $4.5 billion by 2025. This research and the growth of usage of the Bitcoin protocol for new use cases have the potential to bring an end to the centralized network of Ethereum.  Bitcoin on the international, geopolitical stage  The real problem worth solving here is money, and Bitcoin is winning by most metrics, including institutional and nation state adoption.  See also: Bitcoin ETF Ad War Officially Underway With Bitwise Campaign  El Salvador adopted bitcoin as legal tender and has been using it as a way to turn its country around into a prosperous nation. Just recently President Nayib Bukele received regulatory approval to launch his bitcoin-backed “volcano bond” in 2024. Javier Milei, the libertarian president of Argentina who was recently sworn in, is also a proponent of Bitcoin. He has previously stated that “bitcoin represents a return of money to its creator: the private sector,” and it is rumored that Argentina might be the next large nation to adopt a bitcoin standard. Bhutan has been quietly mining bitcoin. Oman made a $1.1 billion investment on bitcoin mining infrastructure, and other powerful countries are expressing interest/investment in Bitcoin.  In the West, we have even seen presidential candidates like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Vivek Ramaswamy implore the benefits of bitcoin as a solution to the loose money policies that have eroded the very fabric of society. With spot bitcoin ETFs right around the corner as well, it’s obvious that no matter what angle you look at Bitcoin from, it is clearly beginning to enter a new phase of global adoption.  Looking ahead to 2024  What people should think about more than anything is that Bitcoin is integral to a decentralized, prosperous and fair future for all, and anything else that claims to be a better alternative, like Ethereum, could be considered a DDOS attack. At the end of the day, a truly decentralized and sound monetary network will eat the lunch of a preminded, centralized alternative any day.  As the halving approaches and adoption increases, it will be increasingly clear in 2024 that as Michael Saylor often says: “there is no second best.”",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,Taras Kulyk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/12/19/the-bitcoin-fee-flippening-is-upon-us,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/99e535ba4020c492f00afc441dad123a1128f3b9-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Access Protocol tweeted that it was giving all owners of the Solana-centric phone 100,000 ACS tokens, continuing the trend of exclusive airdrops that have helped the once-struggling cellphone turn into an unexpected sellout.  During last week's brisk BONK rally traders realized Saga phones came with enough meme coins to pay for the $600 phone. This triggered a buying spree that depleted Solana Mobile's entire stock of Saga phones.  While BONK has since slid over 30% – rendering each phone's 30 million BONK worth less than the cost of the unit – more projects in the Solana ecosystem have lined up for airdrops of their own.

Holders can ""stake"" their ACS with the content creators hawking newsletters, AI-generated anime, headline feeds and such on the Access Protocol website.  Or, they can sell them. At press time on Tuesday the DeFi markets for ACS had seen $16 million in trading volume, with heavy pressure on the sell side. The token fell 6% on its busiest-ever trading day as Saga owners began liquidating their free tokens.  Ownership of the all-important Saga genesis NFT – the proverbial ticket for receiving these airdrops – suggest that less than 3,500 of the 20,000 Saga phones in existence have come fully online yet.

Furthermore, he asserted that he “does not place much significance on a month’s price action” in these markets. He believes conviction must go “beyond a day, week, or month of price movement.” So far, Morgan has noted that yesterday’s decline did not affect him emotionally. He was only surprised by yesterday’s fall’s depth and today’s recovery’s weakness. Nonetheless, he has clarified that this would not influence his choice to hold or sell the digital asset. The Crypto Asset Price To Reach $22 Several cryptocurrency enthusiasts have recently expressed a bullish sentiment toward XRP’s price action. On Sunday, Patrick Riley, the founder of Reaper Financial, stated that the token will reach $22 in the next bull run. Riley added that the crypto asset will maintain a $10 price level after the bull run. Since analysts predict the next bull run will be in 2024, XRP might reach $22 next year.

He believes that XRP will eventually “overtake” Bitcoin, though he did not provide a specific timeframe for this event. As of this writing, XRP was trading at $0.6081, an increase of over 3% in the past 24 hours. The token is gradually regaining momentum and is currently ranked 5th by market capitalization.

21597567,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=565981,1703008814,"Ethereum Bearish Falling Wedge Pattern Appears, How Low Can Price Go?","Ethereum has followed the general trend of Bitcoin over the last few weeks and when the asset dipped from its 2023 peak, so did the price of ETH. Following this decline in price, a worrying pattern has appeared on the ETH chart known as a falling wedge pattern. This was brought to light by crypto analyst Alan Santana, who has painted a grim picture of what this could mean for Ethereum. Ethereum Falling Wedge Pattern Is Bearish In the analysis posted on the TradingView website, Alan Santana explains that the appearance of this falling wedge pattern does not bode well for the Ethereum price. Apparently, the ETH chart had formed a perfect rising wedge which eventually broke bearish. Given this, the crypto analyst explains that it shows that the Ethereum price is moving alongside the rest of the crypto market in a “normal but fast correction.” Related Reading: MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor Calls Bitcoin An Institutional-Grade Asset Destined For $1 Million The crypto analyst also backs up their analysis with the Ethereum Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) indicator. In the chart shared by the analyst, there is a clear decline in the MACD on the daily chart, which lends credence to the bearish pressure mounting on ETH. Source: Tradingview.com Furthermore, using the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart as well, there is also a clear decline. The RSI has apparently already lost its trend line support and is now moving below 50. The simple fact suggests a turn toward the bearish direction for the cryptocurrency. Santana explains that these indicators show that the bias toward a downward spiral is strong, especially since it has already seen a double-top pattern. “Volume continues to drop, the calm before the storm. Slowly, slowly down… Nothing is happening, everything is good then Boom!” the analyst warns. ETH price above $2,200 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com Price Targets For ETH’s Bearish Formation From the chart posted in the analysis, the crypto analyst seems to expect at least a 20% drawdown for Ethereum following the double-top formation. Now, the chart puts the double top formation when the asset’s price briefly touched the $2,400 level last week. Related Reading: VanEck CEO Predicts When The Bitcoin Price Will Reach $69,000 Again After that, expectations have quickly gone in the opposite direction and as the formation plays out, the crypto analyst sees a decline to at least $1,800 from here. If further downside follows, then Santana expects that there will be more drawdowns that will end somewhere around $1,600. The Ethereum price is still trending around $2,200 at the time of writing, suggesting the bear pressure is still mounting. If it breaks down from here, then Santana’s prediction could prove right and ETH’s price could fall back to mid-October levels.

42409150,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcEJ1X,1703008275,"ETFs, Halving, Upgrades – What to Expect With Bitcoin Next Year","As usual, the price of Bitcoin was a big story, and in 2023 it was good news. Bitcoin is once again the best-performing asset class, beating stocks, bonds, and gold by a wide margin. As of today, the price is up more than 150% since the beginning of the year.  This post is part of CoinDesk's ""Crypto 2024"" predictions package.  2023 marked a tremendous surge in institutional interest, highlighted by BlackRock’s application for an ETF in June. There are currently as many as 12 open applications, including those from Invesco, ARK, Fidelity, VanEck, and Franklin Templeton. Although the SEC refused GBTC’s application, a court ruled that the SEC’s reasoning for doing so was invalid. Even just a rumor of approval in October sent Bitcoin’s price skyrocketing.  The energy used to mine and secure Bitcoin also saw significant growth, with the mining hashrate up 100% from 240 exahash to 482 exahash year-to-date. The hashrate is the measure of how many calculations per second are required to add another block of transactions to Bitcoin’s ledger an average of once every ten minutes. Bitcoin continues to leap ahead as the most secure and reliable digital system in the world. Network uptime was 100% for the 14th straight year. 2023 also saw much more widespread recognition that Bitcoin’s relationship to energy and the environment is overwhelmingly positive, contributing to electrical grid stabilization and creating economic incentives to mitigate carbon emissions.  Looking forward to 2024, one thing that’s certain to happen is the next “halving,” when the new issuance of Bitcoin will be cut in half at block 840,000, which is expected to be mined in late April. Despite growing demand for Bitcoin, the supply added per block will nevertheless be reduced by 50%. This will be the fourth halving in Bitcoin’s history. Historically, a bull market has followed halvings. Whether causation or anomaly, it's true until it's not, and we plan Swan's strategy incorporating a high probability of a bull market in 2024 and 2025.  In addition, it is almost certain that we will see the approval of one or more spot Bitcoin ETFs. This would open up floodgates of capital currently in traditional investment channels. The consensus is that this is most likely to happen in January.  Bitcoin's technology trends in 2023 included the continued impact of the Taproot upgrade, enhancing transaction efficiency and privacy. The Lightning Network's maturation underscored Bitcoin's ability to scale by adding layers on top of the Bitcoin protocol to facilitate faster, more economical transactions. Lightning infrastructure has come a long way, with scores of lightning-enabled wallets, on-demand Lightning nodes, and facilitating an estimated 200,000 transactions per day. It will be interesting to watch what this more mature Lightning Network will do in the sustained high-fee environment of another bull market.  In 2024, amid global financial uncertainty, Bitcoin's stability could attract attention from individuals, institutions, and governments seeking to reduce chaos. Bitcoin is reaching record values against weak currencies, gaining support from global politicians, and being used more by people and businesses worldwide. Bitcoin's growth is natural, without central control, and driven by millions of people worldwide who recognize its benefits. Bitcoin safeguards global monetary integrity, and sound money is a fundamental human right.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION | TRADING,Cory Klippsten,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/12/19/etfs-halving-upgrades-what-to-expect-with-bitcoin-next-year,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fab0f62d1904d83e7cda05c41aabc9aa43e87455-1420x947.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Representatives for the Shiba Inu network told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat that they are working with D3 on the application for the .shib top-level domain and plan to apply through ICANN, a global database for internet domains, during the next application window.  Every internet domain application is passed and vetted by ICANN, giving its owners the right to sell all of the domains within a specific suffix, such as "".xyz"" or "".app."" While crypto domains attempt to take this a step further – tying a wallet’s owner to a domain name that can be used as proof of identity on blockchain applications – they do not work across the internet through browsers, email, or mobile devices.

The minor alternative stablecoin, which has an issuance of $3.7 million, dropped from its normal price of $0.97 to as low as $0.39 Monday after a shakeup in ibEUR's main trading pool left the asset's markets imbalanced. At press time ibEUR had recovered to $0.72 after risk-prone traders piled in, hoping for a path back to – or at least closer to – its supposed Euro peg.  But there's no guarantee ibEUR will quickly return to its previous price level. The protocol supporting it ""is not taking any peg maintenance"" at the moment and lacks the treasury liquidity necessary to stabilize the asset, said the pseudonymous admin of the Keep3r Network Telegram chat, which is associated with the project.

""In terms of ibEUR/USDC pool, we have to just wait and let curve pool do it's thing [sic],"" said the pseudonymous chat admin, known as Funk, in the Keep3r chat.

42409158,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcEJRz,1703006939,S&P’s Stablecoin Report Is a Vote of Confidence for Crypto,"S&P Global Ratings, the storied ratings agency known for assessing the stability of banks, credit facilities and other financial institutions and products, has turned its eyes to stablecoins, giving its first wide-ranging synopsis of the state of these supposedly moored blockchain-based assets. In an overview of the relative ability for eight stablecoins to be redeemed for one dollar, the currency to which they are all pegged, S&P has also — arguably and indirectly — affirmed that stablecoins are likely not going anywhere.  “We always say our role is [assessing if] there are ways that we think that we can reduce the asymmetry of information in the market — that is really the way I see our role in the market,” Lapo Guadagnuolo, a senior analyst at S&P Global Ratings, said in an interview with CoinDesk. He added that crypto “is something we're putting strong resources towards, because we know it's a growing area both in traditional and new financial areas.”  That said, of the eight stablecoins S&P reviewed, several received lackluster scores. Most notably Tether’s USDT, the largest stablecoin by market cap and most used crypto asset in terms of trading volume, was given the fourth-lowest score in range from 1 to 5. Meanwhile MakerDAO’s dai [DAI], popular across decentralized finance (DeFi), and the Justin Sun-backed TrueUSD, the fourth and fifth largest stablecoins, respectively, were also given low scores.  At the end of 2023, crypto is not yet past the age where receiving any attention — positive or negative — from an institution like S&P is seen as a form of affirmation. A similar phenomenon happened two years ago, when the U.S. Treasury Department under Janet Yellen convened a study group to determine the risks that Tether’s stablecoin posed to the U.S. economy, which can be validating for industry actors with anti-establishment roots.  Similarly, S&P’s report is a signal that these tools are important — whether or not they actually represent technical advancements.  “The ratings are a very positive development in the normalization of stablecoins,” Nic Carter, a co-founder of VC firm Castle Island Ventures, who began his career as Fidelity’s first dedicated bitcoin [BTC] analyst. “I have quibbles with some of the methodology used, but the fact that the major ratings agencies are paying attention to stablecoins and developing bespoke methodologies is quite validating for the sector,” he said in a private message.  See also: Paolo Ardoino: The Hardest Working Man in Crypto | Most Influential 2023  Indeed, S&P’s mixed report might just be the analysis that the stablecoin sector needed, an independent review of one of the crypto industry’s only tools that could be said to have product-market fit. Stablecoins are big and growing bigger because they offer a way for people across the world to access the dominant U.S. dollar-denominated financial system, and are useful in the U.S. because they’re essentially wire transfers without the hangups.  While the review will likely be cited by many firms on Wall Street looking to test the waters of stablecoins (and many are), not everyone in crypto is taken with S&P’s work. Perhaps for good reason.  “I haven't been impressed with the efforts of S&P or Moody's in this space,” Austen Campbell, a Columbia Business School professor and former Paxos fund manager, said in a direct message. “They seem really out of their depth and not able to iterate on new products. Quite frankly, outside of regular debt, they haven't added a ton of value in new things.”  It was a point echoed by Carter: “Ultimately I don't think crypto native clients of stablecoins will care much for the ratings — end of the day, traders like tether because it's convenient, lindy and is perceived to be remote from U.S. regulators.”  He added: “But the ratings are positive in terms of institutional entities getting comfortable with the sector.”  No stablecoin S&P assessed received the highest possible rating, though Circle’s USD Coin [USDC], Gemini’s gemini dollar and Paxos’s flagship pax dollar were rated as 2s on the list, for “strong.” Earlier this year, the Binance branded BUSD token issued by Paxos, which was the third-largest stablecoin at time, was targeted by U.S. authorities — it was not rated by S&P.  Guadagnuolo explained that S&P’s ratings were not endorsements of any particular products, or even condemnations. Even “weak” assessments of stablecoins like TrueUSD (TUSD) or Frax (FRAX), which received the lowest possible score, should not be treated as “financial advice,” Guadagnuolo said. Both TUSD and FRAX are “algorithmic stablecoins,” which use cryptographic mechanisms rather than assets held in a treasury to support their peg to the greenback.  “That's what sometimes people forget to focus on; the ratings are a relative ranking,” Guadagnuolo said. “We don't endorse and we don't condemn things when we give our opinion.” He clarified the rankings are “forward looking,” an attempt to determine “the likelihood” of the stablecoin maintaining its peg. (This is an important quality for a financial tool that promises to return every dollar deposited, and unlike banks gets to keep the accrued interest earned on those dollars rather than paying yield to users. It’s a lucrative business: Tether made profits of more than $1billion in Q3.)  Notably, S&P did not use its traditional rating system commonly applied to government and corporate debt or assets like credit default swaps (CDOs), where products can be rated from AAA to D. Guadagnuolo said this isn’t unusual, and that the specific terms used “are not new for us.”  “We believe that there is enough differentiation by using five scores,” he said. “Using more scores, we've felt at least at this stage would be probably alluding to a level of precision or specificity which is not there as of now.”  Guadagnuolo, who was project lead on the “Stablecoin Stability Assessment,” also said that the ratings were made using only publicly-available data. He was not, for instance, in dialogue with Tether or Circle, and did not receive a snapshot of the stablecoin issuers’ assets held in a bank, in the way that an auditor might have privileged access to this information. He said he was one of the earliest employees at S&P to focus on the emerging world of crypto. The New York-based company hosts a number of crash courses on market sub-sectors including DeFi.  For competitive reasons an S&P’s spokesperson could not disclose how many people contributed to the assessment, or how many employees focus on crypto full or part time at S&P.  See also: The Niche Application of Stablecoins Is Not a Bad Thing | Opinion  Stablecoins, in a sense, are a type of privately issued currency. For instance, the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu, the top federal banking regulator, recently compared stablecoins to the “Wildcat” era of banking, when individual savings institutions printed their own unique dollars. There are theoretical risks to this form of currency expansion (the late-19th century saw a number of boom and bust credit cycles), as well as certain benefits like the transparency and settlement guarantees of blockchains.  When asked if it is easier to look at on-chain assets than traditional credit ratings, Guadagnuolo said “yes,” with caveats. “There is surely much more information more easily available” for stablecoins than other “exotic” products, which might have “minimal documentation,” he said. “If you know where to go and look,” he added, there is a level of “transparency” in knowing “exactly how the workings of the smart contract work” or “what the volumes are — you can see that in a second.”  However blockchains often obscure as much as they reveal. Investors and users frequently do not know who built a protocol, if it was properly audited or other information that they might have access to “in a regulated space,” Guadagnuolo said. Ironically, crypto, which was created to reduce trust and the need for intermediaries in online transactions often requires users to act more on blind faith and place their trust in strangers than when using a credit card or opening a bank account.  There were many other questions Guadagnuolo could not answer or that an S&P communications rep interjected to say he could not answer, including whether he would use any particular stablecoin, if he was personally interested in any DeFi mechanisms or whether he felt the weight of responsibility publishing information that — intended or not — will likely be taken as financial advice. Guadagnuolo was also not able to directly address why it is S&P, of all institutions, has legitimacy to comment on the credibility of stablecoins (see the Great Financial Crisis that birthed Bitcoin).  “We have a strong, strong history. I don't think we need to … It's kind of for you guys,” Guadagnuolo said.  Whether or not intended, S&P has validated crypto to the extent that the stablecoin industry is now big, lucrative and fascinating enough that companies like S&P cannot look away. And however much it wants to say that its assessments are “opinions,” they are undoubtedly read as informed statements of fact that will go on to influence trading and investment decisions.  That may not exactly be the case at the level of a “DeFi degen,” who at this point is likely inured to criticisms of Tether or who has reasons of convenience to choose USDT or FRAX or TUSD, but S&P’s comments are influential when it comes to publicly-traded companies or esteemed institutions that must be accountable for its decisions and actions. Say Tether collapses, Cantor Fitzgerald, a Wall Street broker that recently gave the offshore company a massive public vote of confidence, will take much more than just a financial hit.  See also: Tether Freezes 41 Crypto Wallets Tied to Sanctions  Likewise, crypto as a whole is dependent on its relationships with traditional power brokers and crown makers — even as it nominally sets out to dethrone the king. (How much of bitcoin’s price action this year resulted from BlackRock’s unexpected spot bitcoin ETF application? There’s no definitive answer, but it’s not zero.) It’d be a mistake to read too much into S&P’s report; afterall, blockchains are open systems and S&P did not need anyone’s approval to do its research into stablecoin trustworthiness.  The one thing Guadagnuolo might say S&P truly confirmed is that there is a mix of stablecoins, each with their relative risks and benefits. And so long that holds true, they’ll always have a mix of users — including people today who need to be convinced of their importance.",POSITIVE,BTC | USDT | TUSD,BTC | MARKET | TRADING | USDT | TUSD,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/12/19/sps-stablecoin-report-is-a-vote-of-confidence-for-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2105025d4fee272485bf57d4989af44f760829b7-1778x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409149,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcEIyE,1703006618,Real-World Assets Build on Solana as Ondo Finance Expands Tokenized Treasury Offering,"Ondo Finance expands its U.S. Treasury-backed tokens to the Solana blockchain and ecosystem applications, letting investors use them as collateral and in decentralized finance (DeFi).  Tokenized Treasuries spearheaded this year's real-world asset boom to bring traditional assets like bonds and credit to blockchain rails.  Tokenized real-world asset (RWA) platform Ondo Finance said Tuesday it expanded its U.S. Treasury-backed tokens to the Solana [SOL] blockchain and its decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols such as Orca and Raydium.  Solana is the first layer 1 network after Ethereum where investors can access Ondo's yield-generating stablecoin alternative U.S. Dollar Yield (USDY) and a tokenized version of BlackRock's (BLK) short-term Treasury bond exchange-traded fund named OUSG. USDY is also available on Ethereum layer 2 network Mantle and OUSG on Polygon.  Ondo's expansion comes fresh on the heels of stablecoin issuer Circle introducing its euro-backed stablecoin EURC to the Solana ecosystem.  Tokenized U.S. Treasuries spearheaded this year's tokenization boom, as crypto native firms and big banks like JPMorgan and Citigroup are racing to bring more traditional assets such as bonds and credit on blockchain rails eyeing more efficient operations and lower costs. The competition also increases among blockchain networks to attract RWAs.  Read more: The Year of Institutional Investment in Real-World Assets  The combined market cap of tokenized treasuries offerings mushroomed to over $760 million from $110 million earlier this year, with Ondo being the second largest issuer after traditional finance giant Franklin Templeton, data by RWA.xyz shows. The growth was fueled by soaring bond yields on traditional markets as the U.S. central bank jacked up interest rates while yields in DeFi lending markets plummeted during the crypto winter.  With crypto markets rejuvenated and DeFi activity picking up, Ondo expects users to tap its tokens as a form of cash in decentralized exchanges, collateral for lending and means for payments and settlements.  “The Solana DeFi ecosystem has demonstrated great resilience and growth potential, thanks to its innovative scaling and low transaction costs,"" Nathan Allman, founder and CEO of Ondo Finance, said in a statement. ""Integrating Ondo's offerings with Solana not only aligns with our strategic growth but also paves the way for novel decentralized finance applications leveraging tokenized US Treasuries, benefiting a wide array of developers and users.”",POSITIVE,SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | SOL | ONDO,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/12/19/more-real-world-assets-arrive-on-solana-as-ondo-finance-expands-tokenized-treasury-offering,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/677999a6aa0f0e300eeaed71fdeebfba21ed830d-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

That’s according to a new report from professional services firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers.  The report, released on Tuesday, said 42 countries have engaged in myriad initiatives to develop crypto-focused regulations and legislation, from holding discussions to passing laws. Those regulatory and legislative pushes are divided into four key focus areas: stablecoin regulation, travel rule compliance, licensing and listing guidance, and crypto framework development, according to PwC.  While the report identified several key areas of consideration for promoting cryptocurrency adoption, some issues proved more popular than others. According to the report, only 23 countries, including Japan, the Bahamas and several EU states, engaged in initiatives across all the focus areas. Meanwhile, Ugandan, Indian and Brazilian lawmakers and regulators focused on just one or two of those areas, underscoring their chillier attitudes toward the crypto industry.  Of the four focus areas, the Financial Action Task Force's travel rule was the most widely considered among the report's countries, with 40 of the 42 jurisdictions at least discussing the matter. By comparison, establishing guidelines for stablecoin issuances was the least considered regulatory issue among the nations.  Eight countries, including India, Brazil, Turkey, the UAE and Taiwan, did not broach the subject of stablecoin legislation in 2023, PwC's report said. Among the countries included in the report, Turkey was the only one to make no progress toward any sort of crypto-related initiatives at a national level.  ""Notable advancements have been made in global digital asset regulation,"" PwC said Tuesday in a report summary.

42409163,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcEJYb,1703004383,Web3 Needs to Develop an Obsession With Brand Image,"The infrastructure of our everyday lives is about to change permanently.  The combination of Web3, crypto and AI will produce services that can offer much more approachable entry points to the general public than a dog-shaped token ever can. However, this means companies will need to learn a new language to communicate to the massive new segment of users that comes with it.  This post is part of CoinDesk's ""Crypto 2024"" predictions package. Aapo Nikkanen is an artist, creative director, writer and researcher.  Suddenly, nouveau tech will reach beyond the speculators, the bros, the “in-it-for-the-techs,” the lurkers, and the recesses of Crypto Twitter. Instead, the most fought-over customers will be the regular, Average Joes or Janes everywhere.  The electric boomer  If you ask me, the crypto industry is largely ill-prepared for the ordinary consumer. They will pick one service, and go on with their days. This is exactly how Sixt became a preeminant car rental service outside the U.S., even when better and cheaper options are available from a less-known competitor. This is the consumer crypto is fighting for. That’s him, that’s her, that’s them.  Ordinary users won’t be bothered to scroll for alternatives. They know Sixt's orange logo and perceive the value embellished in it, even if Google reviews would scream otherwise.  You need to have a unique visual identity, and you need to communicate your selling point in plain English, no matter how technologically advanced it is  The spearhead of crypto mass adoption will not be a spot bitcoin ETF, or a Crypto.com credit card. It will be a Web3 service that can offer the average boomer a service that they need and understand. But they need to understand why they need it. Only then will we see the gradual unlocking towards the mass use of wallets, crypto payment systems, distributed IDs (DIDs), and the rest of it.  There is a baseline of technological progress over time, yet the survival of any product will be increasingly dependent on how well the communication around it manages to reach different audiences. Competition will have a new front, one that includes design, branding and communication, and very soon microwaving a copypasta of the latest meme coin mcap leader will not cut it.  In my view, the winning strategies will embrace two aspects. First, a project needs to stand out from the masses of similar services. Second, a project needs to produce messages that are understood – and accepted by – both the tech-savvy and virgin users.  See also: Crypto Is a Luxury Good | Opinion (2022)  In other words, you need to have a unique visual identity, and you need to communicate your selling point in plain English, no matter how technologically advanced it is. If a regular, sensible person won’t get it, you’re not doing it right.  Take this as your golden rule: if you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.  Unfortunately, saying things simply can be hard. It requires being able to recognize the essential parts and mould them in the right shapes and forms. That’s why it’s so hard to write a three-chord hit song. One needs to find the delicate balance between the aesthetics and the message. When done right, simplifying can bridge the gap between the never-seen-before and the everyday, but it calls for a certain type of creativity.  All technological revolutions have also always been cultural revolutions. The tech alone isn’t enough: it’s the means, not the ends. Gutenberg’s printing press didn’t change the world, but it made the change possible. Steve Jobs attributed the success of Macintosh to the fact “that the people working on it were musicians, and poets, and artists, and zoologists, and historians, who also happened to be the best computer scientists in the world.” Nokia hired early on a philosopher to challenge their different teams, and a techno producer to compose ringtones. Oh, and there was that thing called the Renaissance a few centuries back.  New technologies, to get ready for what’s to come, might profit from learning from that place where image reigns above all: the fashion industry. If there’s one area of business that has capitalized on image more than any other in history, it is the luxury market.  Image is everything  While the world of fashion and luxury might feel like the polar opposite of tech (regardless of Richard Heart's affinity for the extraordinarily gaudy), it is probably the most refined marketing machine out of all the consumer industries. There is a lot to learn from it.  In their unsatisfiable thirst for the new, the fashion and luxury industry is always hungry to hire photographers, artists and creative directors to produce images, concepts and experiences to lure in new customers.  The projects that can stand out early on will corner the market.  In that world, the amount of attention and resources put into image production and branding can reach ridiculous proportions. I should know, I’ve been submerged in it for the good part of the last 10 years. I recently talked shop with a friend of mine who works in one of the high-end fashion houses, and they told me that their company paid a $70,000 per day consultancy fee for a stylist for a photoshoot (for those who don’t know, a stylist is the person who selects the combination of clothes that the models are wearing in the campaign photos).  Although I’m not proposing to try to cut and paste the luxury industry’s practices to tech, this reveals the level of exigence some companies are willing to put into producing just one single image. In the world of fashion and luxury, the competition is savage. These companies are dealing with a racing market that produces endless collections, campaigns and promotional events per year.  Add to this the unusually high price points and fierce competition for a relatively small and fickle clientele, and you have the blueprint for an extremely saturated market. Luxury is hard to break into, and even if you get in, you’ll have to constantly fight to keep that spot.  However, for those who have mastered the game, the returns have been incredible. For example, the Arnault family's [owners of LVMH, the world's largest fashion conglomerate] net worth is estimated to be $238.5 billion as of March 2023. As it turns out, putting $9.5 billion in marketing per year can make normies believe that a handbag made out of plastic-covered cotton is a luxury good.  See also: Crypto Is a Luxury, Gucci Just Hasn't Realized It | Opinion (2021)  I believe that it’s high time for the Web3 companies to start to develop a similar obsession for their brand images. The “in-it-for-tech” narrative simply won’t cut it in the next phase of adoption. If we zoom out, it’s easy to notice how many areas of the market are already saturated, how the clientele is still relatively small, and how the competition is only bound to get more and more fierce.  How many L1s, L2s, cloned DEXes and CEXes, NFT marketplaces, wallets and yield farming play-to-earn meme tokens do you think we’ll need after the bull run? My bet is, not so many.  And the ones that can stand out early on will corner the market. They will become the next Apple’s and Google’s of their market niches. The bubble of first adopters is about to burst, and it might be a good idea to allocate some of that upcoming airdrop to somewhere else.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | AIRDROP,Aapo Nikkanen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/12/19/web3-needs-to-develop-an-obsession-with-brand-image,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6f62fa7cd40e83f4c1ffe198e1bdec0461fca72c-1540x756.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Altcoins Like BONK Or SOL Saw Most Traction In Past Week In a new insight post, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has discussed about some alts that have taken focus during the last week. Based on social media data, Santiment determines tokens to be “trending” if they have been receiving significant attention in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: XRP Gets Rejected Down: Analyst Predicts Bottom Target The below chart shows the top altcoins for each day in the past week on the basis of this metric: Looks like certain coins have repeatedly appeared on these lists | Source: Santiment From the graph, it’s visible that the Solana-based meme coin BONK has pretty much observed the highest amount of traction on social media platforms during this period. The main reason behind the dog-themed coin being so trendy has been its listings on the two largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the sector, Coinbase and Binance. Injective Protocol (INJ) has been another asset that has consistently appeared on the Trending Tokens list. Santiment explains that the source of the altcoin’s popularity lies in its rally and hype for an upcoming airdrop. Solana (SOL), the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has also been discussed by social media users. “Between December 11 and 17, SOL climbed the ranks, attributed to several high-profile projects and partnerships,” notes the analytics firm. “The ecosystem’s growth and its challenge to Ethereum’s dominance in Web3 were hot topics among traders and enthusiasts,” adds Santiment. Solana has also enjoyed some sharp uptrend in the past day, as the asset has shot up around 11% during the period. Unsurprisingly, Internet Computer (ICP) has also gained steam during the last week, as the asset has surged more than 73%. Since its high above $11.5, though, the altcoin has registered some significant decline, as it’s now trading around $9.75. “In summary, this week spotlighted the power of market catalysts — from exchange listings to pivotal updates — and their profound impact on project sentiments and trading activities,” says the analytics firm. BONK’s Exchange Listing Hype Has Observed Some Cooldown Soon after the meme coin received its listings on the aforementioned platforms, the BONK price shot up towards a new all-time high north of the $0.0000349 level. This extraordinary surge proved to be unsustainable, however, as profit-taking quickly ramped up and the altcoin fell back down. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crash To $38,000: Here’s What Could Trigger It BONK has since registered a very significant drop to the $0.0000206 mark.

The $178.6 million acquisition, which will add 390 megawatts of capacity, will be paid in cash, the company said Tuesday. Marathon said it expects the purchase to reduce the cost per coin mined by around 30%.  Bitcoin's [BTC] halving, expected in April 2024, is leading mining companies to reassess their operations to ensure they are prepared for the drop in rewards. One such way is by acquiring smaller firms to bring economies of scale to their activities. Earlier this month, Marathon said it had more than $800 million of cash and bitcoin to ""capitalize on strategic opportunities, including industry consolidation"" ahead of the halving.  Across the two sites, around 21% is vacant and available for expansion, 63% is occupied by bitcoin mining tenants and 16% is already occupied by Marathon.  Generate Capital acquired stakes in two mining sites from bankrupt miner Compute North for $5 million in November last year.  Marathon's Nasdaq-listed shares have gained about 13% to $22.44, one of the better performers among its mining peers. The bitcoin price has risen about 3.2% in the last 24 hours.

This time, the analyst predicts that the crypto token could enjoy unprecedented against the flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. However, there is a caveat for this to materialize. How XRP Could Gain 1500% Against Bitcoin In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, CryptoInsightUk said that XRP could see a move up to 1500% against Bitcoin. This, he stated, will happen if the crypto token could break and hold above the top grey box in the accompanying chart he shared. However, even if that doesn’t happen, he still expects XRP to make significant gains against Bitcoin. Source: X Related Reading: Dogecoin On-Chain Metrics Explode, Can DOGE Price Reach $0.2? He had earlier laid out another scenario where XRP makes an 88% move against Bitcoin. The crypto analyst seemed more confident in this happening as he mentioned that it looks like it is just a “matter of time” before this move-up happens. Many will, however, be hoping that the move of 1500% also actualizes at some point. CrytoInsightUK happens to be one of those who are very bullish on XRP’s future trajectory. The crypto analyst had previously suggested that XRP could recapture the 61,000% gain it saw back in 2017. He highlighted how the token was in a better place and had a lot of potential. He also alluded to how the token is in a “unique position” considering that it has gained legal clarity. Token price shows strength | Source: XRPUSD On Tradingview.com Stronger Than Bitcoin Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto recently asserted that XRP is stronger than BTC. He made this statement in relation to the fact that XRP is trading at a higher price level now, with Bitcoin currently trading at around $42,000, than when the flagship cryptocurrency was trading at this same level two years ago. XRP is said to be trading at 0.00000637 BTC back then. Related Reading: VanEck CEO Predicts When The Bitcoin Price Will Reach $69,000 Again According to Egrag, XRP’s 129% gain against Bitcoin highlights the former’s strength.

Price rallies are usually the result of heavy purchasing demand from wealthy investors, and the recent whale accumulation indicates that this is the case. On December 7, Santiment Feed connected a whale accumulation pattern to ETH’s surge, which culminated in a 19-month high over the $2,350 price point. As a rule, whale activity affects cryptocurrency asset prices. Recent activity among ETH whales indicates that a price rally may be approaching. Ethereum currently trading at $2,235 on the daily chart: TradingView.com Although there is a lot of buying pressure in the market right now, caution is advised because the bottom could not have yet been achieved. RSI And Stochastic Neutral, Ethereum Uncertainty Relative Strength Index (RSI) and stochastic are both currently in neutral territory, according to data from CryptoQyant. There is still uncertainty regarding the market’s genuine bottom notwithstanding the buying activity. We looked at the liquidation heatmap to try and estimate Ethereum’s possible support levels. Based on the analysis, there was a rise in liquidations in the $2,140–$2,170 range. This implies that before Ethereum’s price initiates its next bullish rebound, it is likely to drop below these levels. But in the event of a rally, Ethereum would have to overcome a significant resistance level close to $2,380. Source: Santiment Ethereum’s near-term price changes are difficult to forecast because to the complex interaction of market indicators and liquidation data. Meanwhile, the $2,148 price mark appears to be the asset’s short-term support, according to an analysis of the ETH daily price chart.

The company has acquired an ERCOT-approved mining site in Texas with a high power capacity, indicating substantial growth plans. Cipher Mining is strategically purchasing mining rigs at a favorable price and has recently ordered 37,396 latest-gen Bitmain T21 mining rigs, representing 7.1 EH/s. When analyzing Bitcoin miners, I like to look at the mix of the miner's synergetic optimization, which includes hash rate optimization, energy efficiency, cooling efficiency (if the data is available), and software and firmware optimization and utilization. Beyond synergetic optimization, I think it is also important to look at the miner's strategic planning which includes mergers and acquisitions, product or service diversification, and adaptability in the mining space. Adaptability entails the ability, for example, to upgrade hardware to effectively compete for block rewards if mining difficulty increases, or the ability to quickly source cleaner energy if regulation demands so. This article delves into the latest developments at Cipher Mining ( CIFR ) as we approach the halving event, and the miner's synergetic optimization and strategic planning based on data and insights gleaned from the Q3 earnings release and the latest operational report (November 2023). Prep for the Halving and Beyond Countdown to the halving event has begun and one of the main focus of Bitcoin miners is to maintain the maximum operational efficiency post-halving, as block rewards (the main source of revenue) will be cut in half. Pre-halving, BTC miners typically start aligning their operations in anticipation of the halving event by acquiring advanced hardware (in some cases more mining facilities) to push their hash rate to a higher level, as they aim to offset the reduction in block rewards and maintain a profitable business in the post-halving era. Cipher Mining is gearing up for substantial growth, and its strategic planning is on point. The company recently acquired an ERCOT-approved mining site in Texas, called Black Pearl , under a purchase agreement with Trinity Mining Group. Black Pearl, has an interconnection capacity of up to 300 megawatts. In terms of power capacity or mining rigs, Black Pearl is anticipated to outsize Cipher's other mining sites. The company's total self-mining hash rate at the end of Q3 was 7.2 exahash per second (EH/s) and an additional contracted 1.2 EH/s capacity from the newly acquired Bitmain rigs, making the current total hash rate of 8.4 EH/s. The completion of the Odessa facility is one of the main highlights of Q3. As of the third quarter, the Odessa facility was generating ~6.2 EH/s, using ~207 megawatts of power. The facility had mined roughly 3,531 Bitcoins YTD at the end of Q3, at an all-in electricity cost of ~$8,390 per BTC, with a recent maximum daily mining capacity of ~12.9 Bitcoins per day. The Odessa site currently runs ~90% of Cipher Mining's BTC production. Bitcoin vs Mining Rig Price (Coin Metrics) I'm impressed with the strategic planning of Cipher Mining in its rig purchase timings. The company is taking advantage of the cyclical nature of mining rig prices. Rig prices typically follow the Bitcoin price trend (as seen in the chart above), so they cost more in Bitcoin bull markets and are priced lower when the bear market kicks in. The company has been purchasing rigs at an average cost of $14 per terahash (TH/s). Cipher Mining announced yesterday (December 18) that it had entered an agreement to purchase 37,396 latest-gen Bitmain T21 mining rigs (which represent 7.1 EH/s). The Black Pearl site will be built using some of these rigs. The miner also has an option to acquire another 8.7 EH/s of T21s in 2024 and plans to reach 23.5 EH/s by 2025. The market reaction to the T21 rig purchase news was positive, seeing the stock price jump 17% in a single day. By locking in our price for mining rigs at a very attractive $14/TH, we are controlling our biggest potential capital expense and locking in favorable terms ahead of what we believe will be a bull market for Bitcoin. - CEO Tyler Page November Production Data (Cipher Mining) Cipher Mining achieved an all-time high site hash rate of ~6.24 EH/s in November at the Odessa site, produced a total of 433 BTC from all its mining facilities, and held a total of 558 BTC. Cipher Mining produced ~5 more BTC compared to October's total BTC produced with the same number of rigs deployed and amidst increasing BTC mining difficulty. This suggests a good level of synergistic optimization in Cipher Mining's operations. Cipher Mining - Financials and Valuation Consolidated Statement of Operations (Cipher Mining) For Q3, Cipher Mining reported improved liquidity because the company's largest site, Odessa, commenced running at full capacity and Bitcoin price started seeing significant price gains. At the end of Q3, Cipher Mining reported liquidity of $17 million, which included cash of $3.3 million and Bitcoin reserve valued at $13.7 million at the time the report was published. Q3's total revenue from Bitcoin mining was $30.3 million. Q3's cost of revenue was $13 million, consisting primarily of power costs at the Odessa facility and maintenance expenses for mining operations. Cipher also reported power sales at $2.7 million and a gain of $4.7 million due to a change in the fair value of the Odessa power agreement . Q3's SG&A expenses increased by 34% YoY, totaling $23.9 million. The increase was attributed to an increase in the number of employees at the company and other overheads. The company had 33 employees at the end of Q3 compared to 20 employees a year ago. Cipher Mining had a net loss of $17.7 million, resulting in a net loss of $0.07 per share. Compared to Q3 last year, where a net gain of $59.3 million or $0.24 per share was recorded. Q3 last year included a one-time accounting gain of $85.7 million for the Odessa Power Purchase Agreement. This significantly boosted last year's operating income. On a non-GAAP basis, Cipher Mining reported a net income of $5.9 million or $0.02 per share for Q3 2023. Peers Market Cap (Seeking Alpha) Using a weighted average market cap and P/S ratio calculation, I conducted a valuation analysis of CIFR in comparison to its peers - Marathon Digital ( MARA ), Riot Platforms ( RIOT ), CleanSpark ( CLSK ), and Hut 8 ( HUT ). The respective market caps for each company were summed up, giving a total of ~$11.7 billion. Then multiplying each peer's P/S ratio by its market cap, summing these products, and then dividing by the total market cap gives the ""market cap-weighted average P/S ratio,"" which is 9.7x. Comparing this to CIFR's individual P/S ratio of 7.5x shows that CIFR is trading at a slight discount to the weighted average P/S ratio of its peers and suggests that CIFR may be undervalued relative to the group. Risks There are lots of ""ifs"" in the Bitcoin mining business, as the business is tethered closely to the volatile and speculative nature of its primary asset, Bitcoin. Current speculation includes whether the SEC will approve a spot Bitcoin ETF next year, and if the price of Bitcoin will reach and surpass its 2021 all-time high post halving. This highly speculative nature is an inherent risk. Another risk lies in the potential for dilution. While Cipher Mining may not heavily rely on stock issuance for fundraising, it does issue stocks from time to time. In Q3, CIFR issued approximately 2.8 million shares at an average fair market value of $3.12 per share. This issuance poses a potential risk of stock dilution. However, CIFR adopts a strategic approach to mitigate this risk. The company consistently sells a portion of its mined Bitcoin each month, generating monthly free cash flow. This practice affords CIFR the flexibility to capitalize on growth opportunities, cover OpEx, and fulfill existing CapEx commitments without solely resorting to continuous stock issuances. Takeaway CIFR impresses in both its strategic planning and synergetic optimization. The purchase of new miners at a fair price shows the strategic planning prudence of the management. While it does not hold a substantial Bitcoin reserve compared to some of its peers (MARA currently holds over 13,000 BTC and HUT holds over 9,000 BTC) its ""sell some, keep some"" approach offers benefits that directly affect the company and investors. We are at an important inflection point for the company as we pivot to the next stage of growth, and we are excited to be expanding and investing in advance of what we hope will be a bull market for Bitcoin in the months and years to come. - CEO Tyler Page, during the Q3 Earnings Call The coming year is anticipated to be a very bullish year for Bitcoin and miners, and CIFR could be a good addition to any Bitcoin-related stock portfolio as the latest developments have shown that the company is rightly positioned to capitalize on next year's anticipated momentum.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Altcoins led gains on Tuesday, with NEAR Protocol [NEAR] climbing 15% and Avalanche [AVAX] and Solana [SOL] adding 8% over the past 24 hours, while bitcoin [BTC] rose by around 5%. After reaching a daily low of $40,000 on Monday, bitcoin has picked up and is now trading around $43,000. Traders are looking to the next levels for the cryptocurrency, with Matteo Bottacini, a trader at Crypto Finance AG, seeing a break through $45,000 occurring only if there’s unexpected news or an equities rally. “A BTC breakthrough above $45k should be attributed to either unexpected positive news or an equity rally,” said Bottacini. “Conversely, a dip below $41K, in the absence of negative news or a risk-off sentiment in traditional markets, presents a buying opportunity and is indicative of a potential short squeeze.”  On Monday, Blackrock (BLK) filed a revised spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposal in a bid to appease regulators, likely boosting its odds of securing a first-of-its-kind approval in the U.S. Under the updated proposal, Blackrock’s ETF will feature cash creation and redemption mechanisms, the model favored by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The world’s largest asset manager is the latest of several firms to update its proposal amid speculation the SEC could approve a swath of spot bitcoin ETF applications as early as January. Blackrock first applied for its iShares Blockchain and Tech ETF last month, proposing an in-kind redemption model.  Bankrupt crypto lender Genesis won a bid to block parent Digital Currency Group (DCG) from selling or reducing its ownership of the company until Chapter 11 proceedings come to a close. By barring any changes to ownership, Genesis sought to secure certain tax benefits, a court order issued on Monday shows. The benefits are applicable only if Genesis remains part of the tax-consolidated group of which DCG is the common parent. Should DCG’s stake fall below 80%, Genesis stands to lose benefits on around $700 million worth of “federal net operating loss carryforwards,” a motion requesting the block from November shows.

The smart contracts can be defined, managed, tracked and modified wholly on Bitcoin without needing an intermediary.

Transactional fees are expected to be very low, potentially even eliminated, compared with the $10 average for Bitcoin transactions as of Tuesday.

Bitcoin transaction fees have seen a significant increase in December, potentially indicating a new trend and making bitcoin mining more viable long term. Despite debt and the looming halving, Marathon Digital has the largest BTC stack in the industry and is well-positioned to benefit from higher BTC prices and transaction fees. It has been eight months since I last covered Marathon Digital (MARA) for Seeking Alpha. While the Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining sector is an area where I've had quite a bit of focus over the last year, MARA is not a stock that I've covered with a great deal of frequency in the past: Marathon Digital: Bitcoin Miner Investors Should Look Elsewhere Marathon Digital: Has The Storm Been Weathered? Marathon has the largest market capitalization in the industry and therefore gets a fair amount of coverage compared to the smaller market cap companies that I generally favor. I've also felt that the vertically integrated approach is the better one during times of market stress. All this said, I flipped my view on MARA shares from ""sell"" to ""hold"" in April and left readers with this thought in the final summary: There are several BTC miners that have healthier balance sheets. But there are very few that have the combination of BTC stack and the production capacity that Marathon has. Capacity that the company is continuing to scale through the remainder of 2023. If you're looking for a simple Bitcoin proxy bet that will move up when Bitcoin moves up, MARA should do the trick and possibly to a larger degree than other mining companies that lack the ability to meaningfully scale BTC holdings before the halving. I feel as though all of that is still true today and we can observe the year to date performances of MARA and industry peers to assess which names the bulls have gravitated toward since the depths of ""crypto winter."" BTC Miners Performance (Seeking Alpha) There is no question Marathon Digital's stock performance has been phenomenal this year. Of the roughly two dozen mining tickers I follow, only Bitfarms (BITF) has a better YTD return than MARA. The Transaction Fee Market Shortly following my last MARA article, bitcoin miners enjoyed a large spike in transaction fees that fizzled out by July. This fee spike was attributable to the Ordinals protocol and BRC-20 token swaps. During most of the summer and fall months, fees generally normalized and fell back to 2 to 4% of block reward revenue for miners. BTC fee % of Total Block Reward (HashrateIndex) However, fees from mining Bitcoin are having a moment again. On Sunday, December 17th alone, miners earned 550 BTC from fees. This is an addition to the normal block reward emission, which has been around 900 BTC per day. Adding the 560 BTC from Saturday, December 16th, miners earned more BTC from transaction fees over a single December weekend than they did during the entirety of almost every individual month this year with the exceptions of May, June, and November. Miner Fees by Month (BTC) (Author Chart, via IntoTheBlock data) But even with two weeks still remaining in December from the time of article submission, December transaction fee revenue has already taken out November's total of just under 3,875 BTC. Up until Q4, the May fee market looked as though it was a flash in the pan. But November and December look more like the start of a trend, in my opinion. In fact, December is already the second largest grossing month for Bitcoin transaction fees in 2023 and we're only through December 17th. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind at this point that December will take out May's total of 4,538 BTC from transaction fees. BTC Transaction Fees (IntoTheBlock) Looking at this with more history for context, we can see sustained moves higher in BTC transaction fees during both the 2017 and 2021 BTC price rallies. If we are indeed at the beginning of another BTC post-halving price run, it is somewhat reasonable to assume the transaction fee market can remain more robust than it was during 2022 and most of 2023. Other Considerations I actually don't believe there is a one size fits all standard for valuing these companies in the mining space due to the varying models within the industry. For instance, I don't judge a company like Iris Energy (IREN) and Marathon with the same metrics because they are completely different businesses at this point in time. One sells production each month, while the other has a 14k BTC treasury stack: Ticker BTC Treasury Total HODL Value Market Cap Treasury/MC Marathon Digital 14,025 $577m $4.1b 13.8% Hut 8 ( HUT ) 9,129 $376m $1b 37.3% Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) 7,358 $303m $3.3b 9.3% CleanSpark ( CLSK ) 2,575 $106m $2b 5.4% HIVE Digital ( HIVE ) 1627 $68m $443m 15.3% Sources: company filings, Seeking Alpha, author's calculations If one is optimizing for production efficiency, there are miners that are better than Marathon Digital. If one wants the largest BTC stack as a percentage of market cap, Hut 8 might be the better option, but it comes with debt baggage post-merger. MARA would be somewhere in the middle with a 14% treasury to MC ratio. BTC Miners LT Debt to Total Capital (Seeking Alpha) Marathon Digital's long term debt to total capital is one of the higher figures in the industry at 24.2%, but given the company's enormous 19+ EH/s production, MARA is well positioned to benefit from higher BTC prices and/or transaction fees if they remain sticky. And in my view, it's important that they do remain sticky because a robust fee market makes the economics of bitcoin mining more viable long term: Q4-22 Q1-23 Q2-23 Q3-23 TTM Cost of Revenues $29,700,000 $33,400,000 $55,200,000 $59,600,000 $191,700,000 Total Opex $66,000,000 $21,600,000 $42,800,000 $53,900,000 $228,900,000 BTC Mined 1,562 2,195 2,926 3,490 10,789 Breakeven Price $61,268 $25,057 $33,493 $32,521 $38,984 Sources: Seeking Alpha, company filings, author's calculation In the table above, I'm showing an estimated ""breakeven price"" for Marathon. It seems every time I share this metric in Seeking Alpha articles, there is confusion in the comments section about what it means. To be clear, the electricity costs shared with investors by the companies in this industry and the breakeven price estimated above are not the same thing. The breakeven estimate that I'm showing above is the cost of revenue combined with total opex and divided by the BTC mined in the quarter. Looking at the long term trend in this figure can be helpful in my opinion. While it's certainly not the lowest number we've seen, at $39k trailing twelve months, Marathon should be profitable at current BTC prices if Q4 expenses are comparable to last quarter. And this doesn't include any revenue boost from transactions fees in November and December. But this table is important to understand. Because without a sustainable fee market, MARA and every other public bitcoin miner, will primarily serve as highly speculative, cyclical stocks that need to be properly timed. Without fees, the breakeven price in that table is going to double. And while Bitcoin could absolutely get to $80k post-halving with the central bank seemingly pivoting in 2024, it's far from a certainty. Risks MARA is up over 400% since the beginning of the year. In my view, investors should be cognizant of possible profit taking here in the short term as we approach the end of the year. Beyond that, Bitcoin itself has generally been overbought in recent weeks and may be due for a sizeable pullback under $40k per coin. In that event, MARA shares will likely decline as well. Data by YCharts Finally, mining stocks are not great long term investments given the current models. The block reward is cut in half every four yours by design. Without higher coin prices in perpetuity and/or a sustained move toward transaction fees as a larger percent of miner revenue, the business model for these companies is flawed. While it is very exciting seeing the transaction fees starting to become a meaningful portion of miner revenue, it is important to keep in mind that there are some in the Bitcoin community who would rather see the network usage that is generating those fees removed from block space . That is a very significant potential problem, and there are possible ramifications beyond the scope of this article if Ordinals are filtered out of transactions. Summary I'm actually coming around on Marathon Digital. Given the production capacity and the BTC on the balance sheet, I don't think there is a public miner that benefits more from higher Bitcoin prices than MARA does. It's not the most efficient producer, but it has the largest stack in the industry and the biggest production figures. Dilution has clearly been a major concern as the company has operated at huge negative net income figures over the last two years. Data by YCharts Global hashrate has continued to climb through the depths of crypto winter. However, I suspect we may see some of the weaker players in the industry exit after the halving in April. I see that as a possible opportunity for Marathon as the company could conceivably see share of network rewards increase post-halving if BTC prices don't make a new all-time high shortly after. All this said, one could very easily argue it makes more sense to just buy Bitcoin directly or Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) at a discount if you believe BTC's price will continue to increase. I empathize with those opinions and would caution MARA holders to consider the cyclical history of these stocks as well as the stickiness of transaction fees going forward. If miners are only generating revenue from new BTC emissions, buying mining stocks is a dangerous game to play if you're a novice investor or trader. But in closing, I think there is a strong fundamental setup for Bitcoin and I think the companies that have both exposure to BTC and BTC-denominated revenue streams will outperform the broad market next year. MARA is the giant in the space. I'm not betting against it.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4658607-marathon-digital-a-fee-market-if-you-can-keep-it?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/21589133.jpeg

Once again, he didn’t disappoint, as BTC was the center of discussion in his latest media appearance. Bitcoin Going To $1 Million In an interview with CNBC, Michael Saylor stated that Bitcoin is going to $1 million if it isn’t going to “zero.” He noted that the “big question” in relation to BTC’s potential was whether or not the digital asset was legitimate. According to him, if Bitcoin is a “legitimate institutional asset,” then everybody is “under-allocated” to it. Related Reading: Crypto Founder Predicts XRP Price Will Hit $22, Here’s When His comment about Bitcoin possibly hitting $1 million seems to stem from his belief that Bitcoin as an asset is still untapped, as he expects many institutional players to get in on the crypto token. He noted how 99.9% of the world’s capital is currently tied to other global assets like bonds, real estate, stocks, and precious metals. However, expects that to change soon enough. That change, he believes, will stem from education about digital assets. From that, Saylor says more and more people will realize that they ought to be allocating more and more of their capital to digital assets. Interestingly, he labeled BTC as a “digital transformation of capital,” alluding to its disruptive nature. These institutional players could well be allocating more of their capital to BTC as early as 2024. The new rule by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) recently opened the door for firms to include cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin on their balance sheet. As such, we could see other tech firms adopt Microstrategy’s “Bitcoin Strategy.” BTC price reclaims $43,000 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com BTC Is Going Foward In 2024 Saylor also discussed several macro factors that he considers bullish for Bitcoin going into the new year. These factors include the potential approval of a Spot Bitcoin ETF, the loosening of monetary policies, and wider BTC adoption in countries suffering from inflation. Related Reading: Changelly Releases Updated Predictions For XRP Price, When Will It Cross $10? He also alluded to the BTC Halving event, which he believes is also bullish for the Bitcoin ecosystem. All these factors form a “confluence of very bullish milestones,” which Saylor projects are going to happen over the next six months. Saylor will undoubtedly be fulfilled when his company’s Bitcoin strategy has panned out as Microstarategy is currently in profit with its Bitcoin acquisitions. The company’s stocks are also flying high as it recently hit a 2-year high, thanks in part to its BTC exposure.

42409187,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcES2K,1702984032,Kodex Says Binance Law Enforcement Panel Access Sale is a 'Scam',"A poster on Breach Forums is advertising access to Binance’s law enforcement request panel for $10,000 in crypto.  Access to this panel seems to be from compromised email accounts belonging to law enforcement officials, a common vulnerability in these systems.  Access to Binance's law enforcement data request portal is for sale for $10,000 in crypto via BreachForums, a forum where hackers trade in data dumps, but the company that maintains the portal calls the whole thing a ""scam"".  Binance provides access via a third-party service called Kodex, commonly used by online financial institutions or social media platforms to validate law enforcement requests and facilitate access.  InfoStealers, a publication covering the Darknet and data breaches run by cybercrime intelligence service Hudson Rock,reported, citing their data, that three computers belonging to law enforcement officers from Taiwan, Uganda, and the Philippines were compromised in a global malware campaign in 2023, leading to stolen browser-stored credentials and unauthorized access to Binance’s login panel.  “The reported illicit sale of access to the Law Enforcement Request Portal does not represent a breach of Binance's system. Instead, it may involve compromised law enforcement accounts. With a thorough documentation process in place and constant monitoring for any compromised accounts, we remain committed to safeguarding our user data against any form of unauthorized access,” according to a Binance spokesperson.  ""The Kodex team regularly monitors forums like this and others on the dark web - this is a classic example of a scammer advertising accounts that they know are inaccessible,"" a Kodex spokesperson said via an email interview.  In response to a request for comment from CoinDesk, Miembro, the poster advertising the sale, declined to provide details as ""access is still live.""  ""The only thing I will comment about that is that forcing password resets on all the users or forcing 2-Step auth will not affect us,"" Miembro said via a Telegram interview.  Third-party vulnerability  This sort of attack is becoming increasingly common, and it doesn’t mean that Binance itself has been compromised. Instead, the quality of network security at law enforcement organizations worldwide is the achilles heel.  In 2022, security consultant and journalist Brian Krebs reported on this trend where criminal hackers were targeting and compromising email accounts of police departments and government agencies.  “Some hackers have figured out there is no quick and easy way for a company that receives one of these EDRs to know whether it is legitimate. Using their illicit access to police email systems, Krebs wrote. “The hackers will send a fake [Emergency Data Request] along with an attestation that innocent people will likely suffer greatly or die unless the requested data is provided immediately.""  The vulnerability of EDRs to falsification by hackers, due to inadequate verification mechanisms and the vast number of police jurisdictions highlights the urgent need for a more secure and reliable process to handle these requests and mitigate the risks of fraudulent activities, Krebs writes.  In an earlier interview with CoinDesk, Jarek Jakubcek, head of Binance Law Enforcement Training, said his team often encounters fraudulent requests, such as from private investigators posing as police, including one case where a dissatisfied private investigator used a fake domain to mimic an official request for customer data from Binance.  “We are very lucky to have a team of almost 30 ex-law enforcement people because we know how law enforcement requests should look like,"" he said.  Working on a fix  The Digital Authenticity for Court Orders Act seeks to prevent the illegal use of forged court orders by requiring digital signatures for court-approved surveillance, domain seizures, and content removal.  This bill has been introduced in the Senate but hasn’t moved forward since July 2021. However, this bill would only cover the U.S. and not the tens of thousands of other law enforcement agencies around the world.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said in a letter to lobbying groups Blockchain Association, Coin Center and Coinbase.  ""I write regarding a troubling new report that your association and other crypto interests are … [working] to undermine bipartisan efforts in Congress and the Biden Administration to address the role of cryptocurrency in financing Hamas and other terrorist organizations,"" Warren wrote.  The narrative that crypto provides material support to Hamas, however, has been contested. Blockchain analytics firms contest the Wall Street Journal claims of extensive crypto funding that Warren cites in her letter, saying the actual amount is in the thousands of dollars rather than tens of millions.  Disproven or not, Coin Center said in its own statement that getting like-minded folks together to advocate against legislation ""is the exercise of the fundamental right to freely associate and petition the government.""  ""No one should apologize for doing it,"" Coin Center continued. ""Resorting to questioning motives often reflects an inability to prevail on the merits of an argument itself.""

[The industry] is ""fighting tooth and nail to stonewall common sense rules designed to restrict the use of crypto for terror financing – rules that could cut into crypto company profits,"" Warren wrote.  Warren asked for information on the employment of former government officials by crypto firms, highlighting concerns about the ""revolving door"" of public officials moving into private-sector roles and potentially influencing legislation and regulatory activities related to crypto, anti-money laundering and terrorist financing.  Nearly two-thirds of former members of the 115th U.S. Congress, which ended in January 2019, found employment outside politics, with many influencing federal policy through lobbying or strategic consulting jobs, a 2019 study from Public Citizen found.

Gibran, the eldest son of Indonesian President Joko Widodo, was chosen by presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto to be his running mate in the February election. The 36-year-old politician plans to boost tech education in the country to provide more opportunities for young people, including in digital assets.  ""We are preparing blockchain experts, we are preparing cyber security experts, we are preparing crypto experts,"" Gibran reportedly said at a political gathering on Dec. 10.  Indonesia is a fast crypto adopter not just in Southeast Asia but the world, placing seventh on Chainalysis’ 2023 global crypto adoption index. The country has an estimated 18 million crypto investors and a powerful industry association that also acts as a self-regulatory body. Widodo’s government has tried to leverage this interest in crypto to generate revenue and interest in the country, even setting up a local “stock market” for crypto assets.  Although Gibran is the first to mention crypto, other candidates could also address the topic in an upcoming political debate on Feb. 4. Prabowo and Gibran are the election frontrunners, according to recent polls, and their interest in the sector could rub off on other candidates.

One of the lesser-known altcoins is making some big noise: Helium Mobile (MOBILE) has surged by about 1,000% in the past seven days. Leading the way in the cryptocurrency market’s dynamic trend toward smaller-cap cryptocurrencies is Helium Mobile, whose price has surged by 32% to $0.0072 in the previous day. The altcoin’s trading volume has increased by almost 200% to $20 million, reflecting its recent spike. The market valuation of the coin has broken above $500 million. Within the Helium Mobile Network, the Helium Mobile token is a native protocol token. Helium Network tokens (HNT) provide support for MOBILE tokens because of the strong relationship between the two.

However, it didn’t begin trading on public exchanges until 2023, when its starting price was about $0.0002821. Up until the first week of December, the MOBILE token was trading in a similar range. Helium’s recent introduction of its competitively priced $20 monthly nationwide unlimited mobile services is the reason for the company’s sharp price increase. The mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) has acquired an estimated 8,000 members as a result of this calculated approach. HNTUSD currently trading at $8.74 territory. Chart: TradingView.com The incorporation of blockchain technology into Helium Mobile’s service is a distinctive feature that gives users the opportunity to get “mapping prizes.” There are currently over 363,000 Helium hotspots worldwide, according to data on its platform, and as the price of HNT tokens grows, this trend may continue. About 34,000 users downloaded the app and chose to map, but they haven’t subscribed to Helium’s services yet, compared to 8,000 who have already done so.

Solana’s SOL jumped 8% while Avalanche’s AVAX added almost 12% before giving back some gains. Dog-themed tokens dogwifhat (WIF) and bonk (BONK) trended on Solana, while a hen-themed Coq Inu (COQ) led the meme narrative on Avalanche, surging more than 40% in the past 24 hours.  Traders have increasingly preferred these networks over Ethereum for their much lower transaction fees and faster speeds: It costs less than a cent and takes seconds for a Solana transaction, while Ethereum can cost at least $15 dollars and take up to a minute.  That’s led to more transactional activity on both networks, which has more than doubled in the past month, alongside an increase in active wallets and new users, data shows.  Bitcoin [BTC], meantime, neared $43,000 in Asian afternoon hours as hopes around an expected spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) listing in the U.S. were boosted late Monday as traditional finance firm BlackRock revised its proposal, likely after regulatory feedback.  Some trading firms said recent market movements showed no indication of a market correction in the short term. A correction is generally considered a drop of between and 10% and 20%.  “Bitcoin has formed a double bottom on the intraday charts, and this dynamic indicates that the mood for a deeper correction has not materialized,” shared FxPro senior market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich.  “On the other hand, Tuesday's peak is close to last Thursday's, leaving Bitcoin inside the range.

42409178,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcERRx,1702960312,BlackRock Revises Spot Bitcoin ETF Proposal Ahead of Hoped-for SEC Approval,"On Monday, BlackRock (BLK) filed a revised spot bitcoin [BTC] exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposal in a bid to appease regulators, likely boosting its odds of securing a first-of-its-kind approval in the U.S.  Under the updated proposal, BlackRock’s ETF will feature cash creation and redemption mechanisms, the model favored by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The world’s largest asset manager is the latest of several firms to update its proposal amid speculation the SEC could approve a swath of spot bitcoin ETF applications as early as January.  BlackRock first applied for its iShares Blockchain and Tech ETF last month, proposing an in-kind redemption model.  However, the SEC scrutinized the proposal, raising concerns about investor safety and market manipulation. ETFs typically feature one of two types of redemption and creation mechanisms: In-kind or cash.  An in-kind redemption structure, which many firms say is more appealing to investors, enables firms to redeem shares for bitcoin held by their ETFs. Cash redemptions, which the SEC regards as the safer and more accessible redemption option, replace those shares with their equivalent cash value.  BlackRock is the latest of several firms to agree to issue cash redemptions until in-kind redemptions are approved. More than a dozen firms have filed ETF applications so far. ARK 21Shares has also published a revised S-1 with a similar change.  The SEC has delayed several other ETF applications by Grayscale, Ark 21shares, Vaneck and Hashdex.

The operation, part of a two-and-a-half-year investigation, targeted individuals allegedly connected to the terrorist organization known as DAESH or ISIS. The arrests were made in Valencia (2), Cáceres, Alicante, and Guipúzcoa. Four of the suspects have been remanded in custody by court order. Global Network Financing ISIS Via Crypto? According to the official statement of the Spanish national police, the operation marks the second phase of “MIYA,” an initiative launched in 2021 by Spain’s National Police General Information Commissariat (CGI). The investigation received collaboration from intelligence and security services in twelve countries, including the Moroccan Surveillance du Territoire (DGST), the Algerian Direction Générale de la Sécurité Intérieure (DGSI), the Mauritanian Direction Générale de la Sûreté Nationale (DGSN), the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Swiss FEDPOL, and EUROPOL. Within Spain, the CGI worked closely with its Provincial Information Brigades in Valencia, Alicante, Cáceres, and San Sebastián and the National Intelligence Center (CNI). The Central Court of Instruction number 6 and the Prosecutor’s Office of the National Court coordinated the investigation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Run In Jeopardy? Analyst Finds Market Top Signals With BTC At $40,000 The initial phase of the operation, conducted after a year and a half of investigation, uncovered a person of Maghreb origin residing in Spain who was in contact with a jihadist seeking to carry out an attack in France on behalf of DAESH. The Spanish individual offered their collaboration to the radical extremists. The CGI’s counterterrorism experts located the intended attacker in Switzerland and promptly shared the information with the Swiss FEDPOL. A joint operation was swiftly organized, resulting in the simultaneous arrest of the two individuals in March 2022, along with six others across Europe and the Maghreb. The detainee in Spain was subsequently sentenced to two years in prison for terrorism-related charges and released in mid-2023. Following the initial phase, CGI analysts discovered that the two detainees were part of an international network supporting DAESH, spanning multiple continents, including Afghanistan, the Middle East, Sahel, Maghreb, and Europe. The network allegedly obtained funds through criminal activities in Europe to finance their terrorist operations with crypto. Large sums of money were moved through international transfers and crypto, with authorities seizing nearly 200,000 euros worth of digital assets. Five Suspects Arrested According to the official statement, members of the network also engaged in indoctrination, attempting to recruit new followers to the jihadist cause and providing support to individuals expressing a desire to carry out terrorist attacks. The investigation uncovered evidence suggesting the network’s involvement in planning at least two attacks, ultimately foiled by security services.

There was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance near $41,850 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The pair rallied above the $43,000 resistance zone. Bitcoin is now struggling to clear the key $43,500 resistance zone. A high is formed near $43,464 and the price is now consolidating gains. It is above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $40,515 swing low to the $43,464 high. It is well above $42,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $43,250 level. The first major resistance is forming near $43,500. A close above the $43,500 resistance might start a steady increase. Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com The next key resistance could be near $44,200, above which BTC could rise toward the $45,000 level. A clear move above the $45,000 level could set the pace for a test of $46,500. More Losses In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $43,500 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $42,750 level. The next major support is near $42,000 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $40,515 swing low to the $43,464 high. If there is a move below $42,000, there is a risk of more losses. In the stated case, the price could drop toward the $40,500 support in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 20 level.

21575128,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=565907,1702954841,"Rising Liquidity Will Push Bitcoin To Over $200,000 In Less Than 5 Months: What It Means","According to Dan Tapiero, Managing Partner at 10T Holdings, the Bitcoin and crypto market is on the verge of a major transformation, with the world’s most valuable coin likely to soar to over $200,000 by May 2024. Citing data by Raoul Paul, the CEO of Real Vision, Tapiero suggests that traditional money managers must take notice and prepare for a paradigm shift in the financial landscape. Bitcoin Could Rally To Over $200,000 In 2024 On Rising Liquidity Tapiero bases this bullish forecast on the expected BTC liquidity surge in the coming months. Market participants hope the stringent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve the first batch of Bitcoin ETFs in the next few trading weeks. The Bitcoin ETF, set to be issued by some mainstream players in traditional finance, including BlackRock, will provide regulated vehicles through which institutional investors can get exposure to the coin. Based on Tapiero’s analysis, as more and more institutions adopt Bitcoin, its liquidity will increase, boosting prices. Related Reading: Investors Flock To Stacks (STX) As It Gains 10% Against The Bears – Here’s Why With a Bitcoin ETF on the table, it would also mean the release of institutional-grade Bitcoin trading platforms. This will cement Bitcoin’s position in the industry and its potential role in reshaping finance. Paul’s monthly GMI data, which tracks the sentiment of institutional investors, as Tapiero mentions, further reinforces the general bullish sentiment across the board. Looking at the GMI total liquidity index, the trend has been rising, suggesting that institutional interest in Bitcoin has also increased. This trend also indicates that more funds and asset managers are likely allocating more of their portfolios to Bitcoin, expecting to ride the leg up or be on the safe side. Traditional Fund Managers Watching, BTC Up 64% From September Lows Looking at Tapiero’s preview, the managing partner thinks rising prices will seriously affect traditional money managers. As such, if Bitcoin rallies to $200,000 on increasing liquidity, in the partner’s assessment, ignoring this asset class could pose a significant career risk. Related Reading: XRP Gets Rejected Down: Analyst Predicts Bottom Target Notably, Tapeiro opines that managers who fail to embrace the transformative power of Bitcoin may trail. This is because crypto will continue to evolve and find adoption. As of December 18, Bitcoin is firmly in an uptrend and expanding with rising trading volume. The coin is up 64% from its September 2023 lows. Though there has been a cool-off in the past few trading days, prices are trending above the 20-day moving average. Accordingly, in the days ahead, how prices pan out will shape the medium term. As it is, the immediate resistance level lies at around $44,500. If buyers take charge, the coin may float to $50,000. Afterward, it may float to the all-time high of $69,000 in the sessions ahead.

This development was predominantly led by Bitcoin, which had previously enjoyed a consistent inflow into various crypto funds. In a recent report by CoinShares, a leading digital asset management firm, last week marked a break in an 11-week streak of inflows, with a net outflow of $16 million. This change signals a potential reevaluation among investors regarding their positions in digital assets. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Unshakable Bottom: Analyst Reveals The Price BTC Won’t Drop Below Bitcoin Funds Encounter Turbulence Bitcoin-based funds were at the forefront of this movement, experiencing significant outflows. Last week, these funds experienced a net outflow of $32.8 million, while short Bitcoin investment products also saw a minor outflow of $300,000. Despite this, trading activity for Bitcoin remained robust, grossing $3.6 billion last week, substantially higher than the $1.6 billion yearly average. James Butterfill, Head of Research at CoinShares, analyzed the outflows and suggested that the net flows were primarily driven by the US and German markets, which saw outflows of $18.3 million and $9.7 million, respectively. In contrast, markets such as Switzerland and Canada saw inflows, indicating a mixed regional response that leans more towards profit-taking rather than a wholesale sentiment shift in the asset class, according to Butterfill. Altcoins Gain Traction As Blockchain Equities Surge Interestingly, while Bitcoin and other major assets like Ethereum and Avalanche experienced outflows, altcoins such as Solana, Cardano, and XRP bucked the trend. They mainly registered inflows of $10.6 million, $3 million, and $2.7 million, respectively. These movements underscore the diversification within the crypto asset class and highlight investor interest in a broader range of digital currencies beyond the dominant Bitcoin and Ethereum. Blockchain equities also reflected a favourable sentiment, with inflows amounting to $122 million last week. This marks the continuation of a nine-week streak, accumulating $294 million in total — the largest streak to date. This uptick in blockchain equities underscores the growing investor confidence in the technological infrastructure underpinning cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Market Jolt: Bitcoin Falls Below $42,000 As Short Term Holders Rush To Cash In Regarding price performance, the past week saw mixed results among top crypto assets.

An “on-chain support” range refers to a price below the current spot price of the cryptocurrency that hosts the cost basis of many investors.

On the other hand, any investor who had been in a loss earlier could become likely to sell when the price reaches its break-even mark, as they wouldn’t want to miss out on the opportunity to escape without any losses if the asset happens to drop again shortly. The individual investors’ reactions aren’t generally relevant to the market as a whole. Still, if many holders show this reaction at once, the combined force can cause fluctuations in the price. Now, here is a chart that shows what the different price ranges look like for Bitcoin in terms of the number of addresses who bought at them: Looks like the range around $38,000 is heavy with investors at present | Source: @ali_charts on X As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin range between $41,200 and $42,400 is quite thick with investors. In total, 1.87 million addresses have bought 727,520 BTC at these levels. Bitcoin has been moving in and out of this crucial support region the past day, suggesting that the zone may weaken. If the range gets lost, BTC might see an extended drop below towards the next major support zone. The chart shows that the $37,400 to $38,700 range is where substantial on-chain support could next be available, as 1.28 million addresses have their cost basis.

In the potential scenario of such a drawdown, the current $41,200 to $42,400 range could also become resistance, as these addresses would become loss holders desperate to leave. BTC Price Bitcoin slipped toward the $40,500 level during the past day but has since recovered to the $41,600 mark. It would appear that the support may not be entirely lost yet.

The incident occurred due to a hack on the SyncSpace bridge, which resulted in the unauthorized withdrawal and subsequent market sale of approximately 600,000 AURY tokens on the Arbitrum (ARB) network. Aurory SyncSpace Bridge Hacked In an official statement released on December 17, Aurory’s team disclosed the details of the incident. The team detected unusual activity on their marketplace and promptly initiated an investigation, which revealed that a malicious actor had exploited the marketplace’s buy endpoint. Related Reading: Solana Threatens To Unseat Ethereum In Trade Volume With $1 Billion In Single Day This exploit allowed the attacker to inflate their AURY balance in SyncSpace, enabling them to withdraw around 600,000 tokens to the Arbitrum network. The attacker then liquidated the stolen amount by selling it in the market. To protect user funds, SyncSpace was promptly disabled for maintenance, temporarily suspending deposits and withdrawals. Importantly, the statement assured that no user funds or non-fungible tokens (NFTs) were lost or at risk during the incident. The AURY tokens originated from a team wallet, facilitating withdrawals for accounts not previously deposited AURY. Exploit Mitigated The Aurory statement emphasized that the exploit is no longer ongoing, as SyncSpace remains offline for maintenance. As a result, there is currently no risk of further exploits. Additionally, it was confirmed that the attacker has exhausted their AURY supply and no longer possesses any tokens to sell. Moreover, SyncSpace will investigate further to determine how the exploit went undetected despite the previous expert audit. The team also plans to release a comprehensive post-mortem report once the necessary fixes have been implemented and the investigation concludes. They expect SyncSpace to be back online in the coming days. Related Reading: VanEck CEO Predicts When The Bitcoin Price Will Reach $69,000 Again Since October 30, the price of Aurory’s token, AURY, has experienced a significant upward trend, culminating in a yearly high of $1.9008 on December 12. However, following the recent exploit, the price of AURY has retraced to $1.0868, marking a decline of 23.5% over the past 24 hours and 36.5% over the past seven days. Despite this setback, AURY still boasts substantial gains of 74% and 70% over the 30-day and one-year periods, respectively. The market now awaits to see whether the token’s support lines at $0.9681 and $0.9086 will be able to halt the potential continuation of the price drop or if they will succumb to the prevailing downtrend, putting a significant portion of its 2023 gains at risk.

The company started the process for an ETF 18 months ago but was waiting to have the right infrastructure in place to file an application, which is why it is entering the race much later than other applicants like Ark 21Shares, Grayscale and BlackRock, its CEO told CoinDesk.  “We were trying to position ourselves to be part of that first batch, but clearly that didn’t work out,” CEO Rali Perduhova said in an interview.  7RCC’s crypto ETF differs from other entrants in that 80% of it will consist of bitcoin and the remainder will hold carbon credits futures. Crypto exchange Gemini will provide custody for the fund's bitcoin, Perduhova said.  The filing did not name its custodian for cash and equivalent assets.  In a press release, Gemini said the ETF would let investors balance ""the innovative nature of Bitcoin with the progressive realm of Carbon Credit Futures. In doing so, the Fund provides investors with an integrated single-trade approach to digital assets and environmental sustainability.""  Expectations that the SEC will approve a spot bitcoin ETF in the near future have grown in recent months, with industry observers and participants pointing to the regulator's increased engagement with aspiring issuers and a recent court ruling asking the agency to review one of its ETF rejection orders.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/12/19/small-esg-focused-crypto-asset-manager-is-another-late-entrant-to-bitcoin-etf-race,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b1e31e05493289414e540fd7130372b78c4bce37-3600x2400.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
