42412853,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6dtE,1676502654,"Coinbase, Anchorage Digital Say They'd Be OK Under SEC Custody Proposal, but Risks May Lurk for Others","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is officially working toward forcing investment advisers to make hard decisions about how they keep clients’ crypto assets, but the agency’s Wednesday proposal comes with good-news, bad-news elements now being studied by industry lawyers and lobbyists.  The proposed rule would require SEC-registered investment advisers to put all of their clients’ assets, including crypto assets, into “qualified custodians.” Those custodians have to come from a narrow list of regulated financial institutions – and not, as SEC Chair Gary Gensler made abundantly clear, merely any crypto trading platform.  In the good-news category for the digital assets sector: The state-chartered trusts that many crypto businesses use for custody, such as Coinbase’s Custody Trust Co. and BitGo, may still be able to qualify in that role.  “After today’s SEC proposed rulemaking, we are confident that [Coinbase Custody Trust Co.] will remain a qualified custodian,” said Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s chief legal officer, in a statement to CoinDesk.  Coinbase’s trust is chartered by New York, and it maintains custody for a significant swath of crypto investors’ assets in the U.S. The company advertises on its website that customers can store their assets in “segregated cold storage with a Qualified Custodian.”  Similarly, crypto bank Anchorage Digital was quick to assure crypto investors of its unique role in the industry as the holder of a federal charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).  “Anchorage Digital Bank, the first and only fully operational OCC-chartered digital asset bank, is unequivocally a ‘qualified custodian,’” said Georgia Quinn, the company’s general counsel, in a statement. “While Anchorage Digital would be largely unaffected by the proposed rule, we plan to work with all stakeholders to ensure any transition results in minimal disruption to the digital asset ecosystem.”  Speaking of the SEC, Justin Browder, who co-heads the crypto practice at Willkie Farr & Gallagher in Washington, D.C., said “they could have – if they chose to – shut the door completely on state-chartered trust companies serving as qualified custodians for SEC-registered investment advisers. They left the door open.”  Cutting out the exchanges?  But SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda seemed to hit on one of the potentially alarming pieces of the agency’s proposal for the industry: the way it potentially cuts out the crypto exchanges.  “Because crypto assets trade on platforms that are not qualified custodians, an adviser that trades crypto assets on a platform would violate the proposed rule,” Uyeda said. “How could an adviser seeking to comply with this rule possibly invest client funds in crypto assets after reading this release?”  He argued the proposal “takes great pains to paint a ‘no-win’ scenario for crypto assets,” and though he voted in favor of moving forward with it, he said this approach “appears to mask a policy decision to block access to crypto as an asset class.” Jake Chervinsky, chief policy officer at the Blockchain Association in Washington, lamented on Twitter that it “would flagrantly violate the SEC's mission by making investors *less* safe.”  Gensler potentially added to the discomfort by pointing out to reporters Wednesday that even under the existing standards set in 2009, investment advisers may have been in violation of the rules by engaging with unregistered crypto exchanges. “I don't think that there are many people in the crypto field that would say a crypto exchange is a qualified custodian,” Gensler said in an online press conference after the SEC meeting. “I don't think there's much debate here. What I'm highlighting is that today investment advisers ought to be aware that the provisions by these crypto exchanges don't meet the qualified custodian provisions of the 2009 rule.”  How registered advisers arrange custody now  The list of registered investment advisors (RIA) ranges from the smallest corner shops to giants such as Capstone Financial Advisors, Sequoia Financial Group, Tiger Global Management and ExodusPoint Capital Management. Their ranks also include the investment-advice arms within the big Wall Street banks, such as JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp.'s Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo & Co., though those banks have to be careful about crypto custody because of increased scrutiny from U.S. regulators.  A CoinDesk analysis of how registered investment advisers arrange custody for crypto assets revealed the top choices for traditional financial firms include Coinbase and Anchorage Digital, while crypto-native investment advisers rely on a much wider range of firms inside the industry, including BitGo.  “Many exchanges, crypto lending and trading platforms, and software providers hold themselves out as ‘custodying’ crypto assets,” said Jeff Horowitz, chief compliance officer at BitGo, one of the biggest custodians in the crypto industry. “BitGo offers fully regulated and qualified custodians via state-chartered trust companies in both South Dakota and New York,” and it said its customer assets are segregated and protected in a bankruptcy.  The SEC proposal said the current list of companies providing custody of crypto assets includes “one OCC-regulated national bank, four OCC-regulated trusts, approximately 20 state-chartered trust companies and other state-chartered, limited purpose banking entities, and at least one [futures commission merchant].”  The proposal is now open for a 60-day comment period in which all the above points will be deeply discussed, and no SEC proposal is guaranteed to finish as a final rule. The rule-making process usually takes at least several months – sometimes years – and it’s not over until the SEC votes again to implement a final rule.  Browder said a full legal analysis of the 434-page proposal may take some time before trust companies fully work out what hoops they’d have to jump through to meet the conditions and standards of being a qualified custodian.  “They didn’t make it black and white,” Browder said. And the proposal included “a lot of skepticism” about crypto firms’ custody practices.

42412846,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6dqQ,1676499410,Crypto Trading Firm Auros Global Restructures $18M in Debt on Maple Finance,"Crypto trading firm Auros Global, a victim of crypto exchange FTX’s bankruptcy, has reached a resolution to restructure its distressed debt on blockchain-based lending protocol Maple Finance, its primary creditor, M11 Credit, said in a statement on Wednesday.  Auros had some $18 million in unpaid loans as of Dec. 20, accrued from two M11 Credit-managed lending pools on Maple. The firm had missed loan repayments since late November, citing liquidity problems due to frozen funds on FTX. Auros entered into provisional liquidation in December, granted by a British Virgin Islands court.  M11 said Auros has already repaid 55% of the outstanding debt to the lending pools. Another 40% of the debt was reissued for a maximum of nine months at 8.64% annualized interest in three cycles of 90 days. The rest of the debt was renewed at zero interest with a 90-day maturity.  Liquidity providers of the affected lending pools should expect full recovery of their funds, M11 Credit said.  The Auros debt restructuring comes as a relief for crypto credit markets after a turbulent year. Distressed debt piled on lending protocols such as Maple as the collapse of high-profile crypto firms such as Celsius Network, Three Arrows Capital and FTX resulted in a widespread liquidity crisis, leading to loan defaults and insolvencies.  M11 Credit is still in the process of recovering $36 million of outstanding debt on Maple from Orthogonal Finance, a crypto trading firm that allegedly misrepresented its financials after FTX collapsed.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/02/15/crypto-trading-firm-auros-global-restructures-18m-in-debt-on-maple-finance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1c1af8cc0794ef2549ce4f06f7fd04e456e35bf6-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42412851,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6dw2,1676499355,Tether's USDT Gains $1B as Paxos Burns Over $1.8B of Binance USD Stablecoins,"Tether’s USDT, the largest stablecoin by circulating supply, has gained some $1 billion in market capitalization as crypto investors flee rival Binance USD (BUSD), which came under regulatory scrutiny earlier this week.  USDT’s market cap has grown to $69.5 billion from $68.5 billion since Monday, according to cryptocurrency price tracker CoinGecko. This is the highest since last June’s crypto market turmoil, when traders placed bets on Tether’s demise.  Tether’s recent gains come as BUSD, which is issued by Paxos under the exchange giant Binance’s brand, has been rapidly shrinking.  Blockchain data by crypto intelligence firm Nansen shows that Paxos has burned more than $1.8 billion worth of BUSD since Monday morning.  The market capitalization of BUSD has fallen to $14.3 billion from $16.1 billion during this period, representing a 11% decline, CoinGecko data shows.  The $136 billion stablecoin market is in the midst of a shakeup as U.S. regulators ratchet up the pressure on Paxos and BUSD, the third-largest stablecoin.  On Monday, Paxos announced it would stop minting BUSD after Feb. 21, citing orders from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). Meanwhile, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is preparing to sue the firm for issuing unregistered securities, CoinDesk reported earlier this week.

While Paxos’ other stablecoin, the seventh-largest Paxos dollar (USDP), has avoided the regulators’ probing, the token has still experienced some $100 million of net redemptions, culminating in a 11% decrease in supply.  Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency whose price is fixed to an external asset, such as the U.S. dollar. If demand falters for a stablecoin, issuers decrease the supply by removing tokens from circulation, a pratice called burning, to keep the price peg.  Other large-cap stablecoins such as Circle’s USDC and MakerDAO’s DAI haven’t budged, indicating that investors have flocked to USDT from BUSD or sold their holdings for fiat money and other digital assets.  Conor Ryder, analyst at digital asset research firm Kaiko, told CoinDesk earlier this week that Tether was poised to be a “clear winner” of the stablecoin market’s reshuffling.

The request comes days after prosecutors alleged that Bankman-Fried used a virtual private network at least twice, supposedly to watch National Football League playoff games. It's a sharp escalation of previous requests, which mainly saw prosecutors ask that Bankman-Fried only be banned from using encrypted or ephemeral messaging applications.  ""Within the span of a month, the defendant has used at least two methods of encryption in a manner that warrant modification to his bail conditions. His behavior shows that the existing conditions leave too much room for circumvention of restrictions aimed at preventing inappropriate conduct, including contacting witnesses and accessing cryptocurrency assets,"" the filing said Wednesday.  The filing also pointed to Bankman-Fried's ""contact with a possible trial witness in January 2023 using Signal"" as another cause for concern.  Under the terms of the new proposal, Bankman-Fried would not be allowed to use cellphones, tablets, computers or the internet except to review discovery documents, contact his lawyers through Zoom, email using his Gmail account and be able to call or send SMS messages through his phone.  ""The defendant shall be prohibited from using any other cellphone and computer call and messaging applications,"" the filing said, adding that prosecutors also wanted to install monitoring software on his cellphone and computer.  The Gmail account and phone would likewise be monitored.  ""In particular, restrictions on the use of computers, cellphones, and the internet are appropriate when a defendant has attempted to circumvent bail restrictions, attempts to commit obstruction, or may continue the commission of criminal acts,"" the filing said.

On Wednesday, Blur published a blog post aimed at NFT creators that laid out the differences in royalty payment options between its platform and OpenSea. When Blur first launched in October, the platform followed a royalty-optional model popularized by competitors like X2Y2. In November, it expanded royalties to permission NFTs and a month later began enforcing a minimum royalty fee of 0.5%.  Now, Blur says that in order for creators to collect full royalties on its platform, collections will need to blocklist OpenSea, which enforces full royalties for new projects that launch on its platform. It does so by allowing creators to add a code snippet to their NFT contracts that restricts sales of their project on secondary NFT marketplaces that don't honor royalties.  “Our preference is that creators should be able to earn royalties on all marketplaces that they whitelist, rather than being forced to choose,” Blur said in its post.  The blog post outlined the various approaches that creators can take to ensure they earn royalties when their projects are listed for resale on Blur. The platform said that because of conflicting rules, artists can’t earn royalties on both OpenSea and Blur simultaneously and that it recommends that creators block their tokens from being listed on OpenSea.  “Today, OpenSea automatically sets royalties to optional when they detect trading on Blur. We would like to welcome OpenSea to stop this policy so that new collections can earn royalties everywhere,” Blur said.  In January, traders discovered an apparent loophole that allowed Blur to skirt past OpenSea’s policy of blocking trading on secondary marketplaces that don't honor creator royalties. This has since intensified competition between OpenSea and Blur, which has seen rapid growth in trading volumes in recent months, according to blockchain data analytics platform Nansen.

Stablecoins as securities  The narrative  So … Paxos, eh? Stablecoin issuer Paxos is tussling with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) over the Binance USD stablecoin.  Why it matters  Is this the opening salvo against stablecoins? Or is this more about Binance and a U.S. company’s relationship with the exchange, which doesn’t have a clearly defined headquarters and which has often been seen as a somewhat lawless entity?  Breaking it down  To recap: Last week CoinDesk reported that NYDFS was investigating Paxos. On Sunday the Wall Street Journal reported that the SEC had sent a Wells Notice – a formal declaration saying, “Hey we think this thing you did violated federal securities laws” – to Paxos over BUSD. Somewhere between kickoff of Super Bowl LVII and hungover Eagles fans waking up the next morning, Paxos announced it was suspending issuance of new BUSD at the direction of NYDFS, which published a consumer alert on Monday.  While some are interpreting this as an assault on stablecoins, all signs so far seem to indicate this may be more about Binance and how it’s related to BUSD.  I’ve spoken to a number of individuals over the past few days about this situation, all of whom asked to speak anonymously because of ongoing work with regulators.  What we don’t know:  How the SEC is going to define BUSD as a security. It seems difficult to square BUSD’s existence with the tenets of the Howey Test – 1) an investment of money 2) in a common enterprise 3) with the expectation of profit 4) from the efforts of others. For one thing, BUSD is a stablecoin. It’s not intended to generate a return in and of itself, and Paxos doesn’t offer a yield-bearing product with BUSD. Another case, the 1990 Reves vs. EY U.S. Supreme Court case, may be a more applicable precedent. There's also the idea that stablecoins may be money market funds. The confounding factor is that both the SEC and NYDFS seem to be focused on BUSD, and not USDP, the other stablecoin Paxos issues.  What’s happening next on the Paxos front. Paxos has gone out of its way over the past few years to appear as regulatorily compliant as possible, securing state and federal licenses. One could expect the company to settle with the SEC, but the company has now promised to litigate should it come to that. I’ve reached out to Paxos to ask for more information.  What’s happening next on the Binance front. This is, I think, maybe one of the more pertinent questions. The fact that these actions seem focused on Binance USD rather than Paxos itself strongly suggests Binance may be the actual target here. Making things more interesting, Binance has said it will continue to automatically convert users’ stablecoin holdings into BUSD, even though no new BUSD is being issued. I’ve asked a Binance spokesperson for more information.  What we do know is that the SEC’s so-called crypto crackdown – this week’s Wells Notice, coupled with last week’s Kraken settlement and Wednesday’s proposed rule – is escalating, and the industry is nervous.

SEC Proposal Could Bar Investment Advisers From Keeping Assets at Crypto Firms: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission plans to introduce a rule Wednesday that would strengthen the rules around the types of entities that registered investment advisers use to hold assets, like crypto.  Senate Banking  The Senate Banking Committee held its first hearing on crypto for 2023 on Tuesday, titled “Crypto Crash: Why Financial System Safeguards are Needed for Digital Assets” and featuring Duke Financial Economics Center Policy Director Lee Reiners, Georgetown Institute of International Economic Law Adjunct Professor and Visiting Scholar Linda Jeng (who’s also general counsel at the Crypto Council for Innovation, though she did not appear in that capacity) and Vanderbilt University Law School Professor Yesha Yadav.  I live-tweeted the hearing; you can catch up here.  The two pieces of news: Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Roger Marshall (R-Kansas) plan to reintroduce a bill enhancing anti-money laundering and know-your-customer rules around crypto, and Senator Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) is working on a proof-of-reserves bill.  Beyond that, I’m not that sure we learned too much during the hearing. In many respects, it played out typically – skepticism from the committee chair, Senator Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), a focus on the SEC from the ranking member, Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.), and largely predictable answers from the witnesses.  The big question, as always, is whether and when Congress will actually start moving a bill. The expectation still seems to be that stablecoins will be the first area Congress actually addresses, though we didn’t hear too much about stablecoins in Tuesday’s hearing.  Moment of Reckoning  By Jesse Hamilton  For a brief moment in time, a former crypto executive was running one of the U.S. agencies that regulates national banks, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.  Under the watch of Brian Brooks, who returned to the crypto industry after he left the OCC, the regulator took an open-armed approach to digital assets. For a while, the OCC encouraged crypto firms to chase charters, and a few of them got provisional access into the ranks of trust banks. With the arrival of President Joe Biden’s more crypto-suspicious appointees, though, the door slammed shut, and since then the FTX debacle released a poisoned cloud into the offices of the U.S. banking agencies – also including the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.  The crypto industry really wants to connect to U.S. banking. It’s the only way companies are likely to fulfill their dreams of mass adoption. But as the Federal Reserve demonstrated when it barred Custodia Bank from the list of its Fed-connected lenders, crypto isn’t yet finding a harbor in the federally regulated industry. That impasse means the wider crypto world is unlikely to soon reach the mainstream status that many hoped for, with its free and reliable flow of regulated transactions.  Crypto took a big step back in 2022, and its damaged reputation among the regulators (who are publicly breathing a sigh of relief that they made it hard for digital assets to get inside banking) and the U.S. lawmakers who have been poised to work on the first major industry legislation will be difficult to overcome by the end of this year.  Also, the federal government isn’t through with its campaign of enforcement actions and prosecutions, which the White House recently egged on. So far, 2023 is shaping up as a moment of reckoning between crypto and the U.S. watchdogs.  Read more.

42412843,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6dlk,1676494645,"Former Paxos Exec: Regulators Failed to Address Crypto Collapses, Now They’re Going After 'On-Ramps'","The demise of several large crypto-related companies is forcing the hand of regulators who are looking to find ways to block crypto from mainstream financial markets, said Jesse Austin Campbell, former head of portfolio management at Paxos.  “Regulators in general failed to adequately address Celsius [Network], Terra and FTX, and are now going after any of the on-ramps they can to try to reduce access to the system,” Campbell, now an adjunct professor at Columbia University's Business School, said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Wednesday.  According to Campbell, similar approaches are being taken by federal banking regulators making policies “to restrict access for crypto companies to the banking system.”  Paxos is one of those crypto companies facing regulatory scrutiny. Earlier this week, the stablecoin issuer received a Wells notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) warning of regulatory action for the company's alleged sale of an unregistered security, in this case the Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin. The regulator claims the platform’s stablecoin is not backed one-to-one with the U.S. dollar. Paxos has claimed the opposite, and said it will litigate if necessary.  However, Paxos did cease minting the BUSD token after being told by the New York Department of Financial Services there are unresolved issues related to Paxos’ oversight of its relationship with the Binance exchange. Binance does not have a direct involvement in the BUSD stablecoin outside of its name but Paxos said it was ending its relationship with the exchange. Paxos is licensed in New York.  “The NYDFS is the regulator and they’re the ones with the authority directly to tell Paxos what they’re allowed to do,” Campbell said. “The SEC can make a play, alleging [BUSD is] a security, but just like Ripple, that’s probably going to court. With the NYDFS there’s no question.”  Paxos had upwards of $16 billion in BUSD tokens before it began burning them following its Monday announcement that it would stop the minting.  Campbell, who was at Paxos between March and December 2022, said the crackdown on the company shows that “regardless of intent,” what regulators are showing the public is that “probably, the greatest mistake you could have made is to be an onshore, regulated company in the crypto space.”  “You are the ones constantly getting punished, fined and harassed even though you’re not the ones who lost user money,” he said of licensed companies like Paxos. “A lot of people offshore have done things that are significantly more objectionable and are not facing the same degree of scrutiny.”  In a later interview with CoinDesk Campbell said while unintentional, ""I think the problem is that it is the world [federal regulators] have created, and it's important to surface that point."" While U.S.-licensed companies are getting ""smacked around,"" offshore companies like Tether, the issuer of the USDT stablecoin, are ""just growing and growing and growing.""  As Campbell noted in an op-ed for CoinDesk, stablecoins are “very simple instruments,” and are not new.  “It’s the promise of, ‘you’re going to give somebody money and later on, they will give you back $1.’ It’s something that already exists,” Campbell said on CoinDesk TV. He said that what is “confounding to me is the extreme sort of noise and confusion around [stablecoins] when really they work very similarly to things we're already familiar with.”  Read more: How Crypto Advocacy Must Change Post-FTX Collapse / Opinion",NEGATIVE,USDT,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | USDT | BNB,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/02/15/former-paxos-exec-regulators-failed-to-address-crypto-collapses-now-theyre-going-after-on-ramps,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ca6fe53f2b9bbde80eedd873534dceac52640e58-800x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412844,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6dmg,1676493020,Bitcoin Soars Past $24K to Reach 2-Week High,"Bitcoin bolted past $24,000 for the first time in two weeks after surging more than 8% over the past 24 hours, likely the result of the type of short squeeze that historically has sent prices higher. The percentage increase was the largest since BTC jumped 10.5% on Sept. 9.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization had dropped below $21,600 at different points in recent days amid growing investor fretfulness about crypto regulation, particularly targeting the stablecoin market, and about future U.S. central bank steps to tame inflation.  But those concerns seemed to fade quickly as bitcoin surged past $24,100 by the afternoon before retreating slightly.  Data from crypto data provider Coinglass showed that traders who bet on price shifts liquidated some $65 million of bitcoin over the past 24 hours, from which about $60 million were in short positions.  Crypto-related stocks also jumped, with both exchange Coinbase (COIN) and bitcoin miner ​​Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) increasing 15%. Business software company MicroStrategy (MSTR), a major BTC holder, recently rose more than 9%.  Ether (ETH) was up 5.5% to recently trade at $1,645. The CoinDesk Market Index spiked 4% for the day.  Lucas Outumuro, head of research at blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock, said that investors also found reason for optimism in Tuesday's tepid U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI), which showed inflation declining slightly to 6.4% on an annual basis even as it failed to meet analysts expectations. ""Since the market reaction to the CPI print was positive even if it was higher than expected, I believe this was seen as a sign of strength for the rally to continue in risk assets altogether,"" Outumuro told CoinDesk.  Riyad Carey, research analyst at crypto data firm Kaiko, also said that markets also may have already accounted for concerns about increased regulation tied to stablecoins, including Binance's BUSD token.  ""Crypto has had some added catalysts with the BUSD news, which has largely been absorbed and I think today was a reflection of some of the regulatory fears – and immediate fears around BUSD – easing,"" Carey told CoinDesk.

While Lido Finance's product isn't technically the same thing as a centralized yield earning account, I'm not sure the SEC will see a major distinction. Lido's terms of use make clear geo-blocking is a possibility. Losing the ability to interact with the interface without a VPN is something US users should consider. US regulators appear to be at the beginning of a significant crackdown on cryptocurrencies and the banks servicing the broader industry. The latest development in what has been dubbed ""Operation Chokepoint 2.0"" by some, has been the halting of further minting of the Binance-branded ( BNB-USD ) dollar-pegged stablecoin Binance USD ( BUSD-USD ) by Paxos Trust Company. In my view, there are significant implications from that and the latest development has been a Wells Notice issued to Paxos from the SEC amid the claim that BUSD is an unregistered security. This is important context given what happened last week. Claim Against Kraken Just days before Paxos halted BUSD minting and disclosed the Wells Notice, Kraken paid a $30 million fine and ceased offering staking-as-a-service products for its customers after the SEC charged the company with selling unregistered securities. Kraken is one of the largest exchanges by trading volume and has been an important crypto on-ramp for US customers. It is important to distinguish, however, that the SEC's charge was not a result of Kraken selling certain crypto coins. Rather, the SEC believes Kraken's yield products are unregistered securities. In the SEC's press release: The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Payward Ventures, Inc. and Payward Trading Ltd., both commonly known as Kraken, with failing to register the offer and sale of their crypto asset staking-as-a-service program Part of this staking as a service model that the SEC appears to be calling into question is Kraken's ETH staking pool on Ethereum ( ETH-USD ). Like similar centralized and decentralized products, Kraken is essentially an ETH-staking intermediary for customers who lack the minimum ETH for direct staking. This product has made Kraken the third largest staker on Ethereum behind only Lido Finance ( LDO-USD ) and Coinbase ( COIN ): Rank Entity Staked Validators Market Share 1 Lido 4,884,448 152,639 29.2% 2 Coinbase 2,071,424 64,732 12.4% 3 Kraken 1,234,496 38,578 7.4% 4 Binance 1,034,144 32,317 6.2% 5 stakefish 573,792 17,931 3.4% Source: Dune Analytics/hildobby, as of 2/14/23 Since Coinbase is also a huge contributor to ETH staking through pooled customer funds, it stands to reason that Coinbase could also be sued by the SEC for similar unregistered securities infractions. That said, Coinbase has been proactive in the public discourse over the last several days and has laid out what it says to be the differences between what Kraken offered customers and what Coinbase offers. Furthermore, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said on Twitter that the company is planning to fight any similar charge from the SEC in court: Coinbase's staking services are not securities. We will happily defend this in court if needed. How that plays out is very much up in the air, but if Coinbase does indeed get charged with unregistered securities sales by the SEC for the same reason as Kraken, it opens up the possibility that any market demand for staking intermediaries could go on-chain. One possible winner in that regard could be Lido Finance. Lido to the Rescue? Lido Finance is a liquid staking protocol that I've covered for Seeking Alpha in the past. One of the major responses to the Kraken news is the idea that Lido Finance, RocketPool ( RPL-USD ), and other similar liquid staking protocols should benefit from centralized exchanges losing the ability to provide any sort of staking as a service product. However, I'm not quite as convinced. To be clear, I do believe it makes sense to go through a staking pool if the user can't stake directly on-chain, either due to high minimum requirements or due to technical competency concerns. But I'm not sure the SEC will make a distinction between a corporation and a DAO. If Kraken's staking as a service product is an unregistered security in the eyes of the SEC, I think we can reasonably infer the agency will take the same view regarding Lido Finance's or Rocket Pool's product offerings. Right or wrong, I'm not totally sure the agency would view decentralized staking services much differently from the yield accounts offered by centralized exchanges. Especially considering liquid staking protocols are also minting ETH derivative coins that the SEC could potentially consider unregistered securities as well. This Could Get More Complicated Something I think the US-based crypto user should think deeply about is these protocols laid out right in the terms of use that geo-blocking is a possibility. This is from Lido's: we reserve the right to limit or restrict access to the Interface by any person or entity, or within any geographic area or legal jurisdiction, at any time and in our sole discretion. We will not be liable to you for any losses or damages you may suffer as a result of or in connection with the Interface being inaccessible to you at any time or for any reason. From the user's standpoint, if one is unable to interact directly with the contract without the front-end application, it might be too risky to stake through these protocols since jurisdiction is a non-zero percent risk at best and a major headwind at worst. From the LDO investor's standpoint, geo-blocking US consumers from Lido's front-end interface would almost certainly slow the growth of what has otherwise been a hugely popular DeFi protocol, but it is unlikely to stop it entirely. As I mentioned, DeFi participants that are more technically savvy can interact with the contract without the front-end interface. And it's also possible that foreign developers could build an unaffiliated front end and simply opt to not comply with US regulators. None of this would be good, though. For what it's worth, Lido Finance's head of business development seems concerned as well, recently telling Bloomberg : The biggest risk I personally see as a US-based person is if they come down and say you can no longer even interact with or contribute to these types of protocols. Then me as a contributor to the DAO, does that mean I can't work on Lido anymore? Do I have to go leave and do something else? Summary What I don't want this article to portray is FUD. I'm still very long-term bullish crypto, Ethereum, and liquid staking protocols on Ethereum. What I'm much less certain about is whether US consumers will be allowed to legally interact with many of these DeFi protocols. I don't think there is any doubt at this point there is a broad crypto crackdown that seems to be just getting started. If I were a DeFi user in a more crypto-friendly jurisdiction, I wouldn't be nearly as concerned as a US-based DeFi user. Crypto will progress with or without the United States. Whether or not the SEC considers Lido Finance, the staking service Lido provides, LDO, or the liquid staking tokens that Lido mints to be securities may not ultimately matter 5 to 10 years from now. However, if the SEC does take that position, I think it will slow growth in the protocol and by extension reduce demand for LDO. To be clear, I'm not saying sell everything. But I am of the opinion that LDO holders (and RPL holders) should probably be cautious. Especially after such nice price runs over the last couple of weeks.",NEGATIVE,ETH | LDO,ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | LDO,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4578677-crypto-crackdown-lido-finance-beneficiary?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/9463774.jpeg

Handling of the $1.1 billion DCG promissory note is point of contention with the Winklevoss twins, majority owners of the Gemini exchange, a major creditor of Genesis. Under the restructuring plan, DCG will exchange the $1.1 billion 2032 promissory note for newly issued convertible preferred stock. DCG will be allowed to refinance its May 2023 term loans through a new facility with a June 30th, 2024 maturity. The agreement buys DCG meaningful time before it is forced to sell a large portion of its own holdings in Grayscale's products, including GBTC. Despite heightened fear and doubts, the ongoing Genesis bankruptcy drama likely only marginally affects the pricing of large-cap digital assets going forward. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) even rebounded strongly to close the week of the bankruptcy filing. Interest rate sensitive names, including digital assets, had been meaningfully down that week even with the somewhat favorable PPI Release . However, rumblings out of the mid-January bankruptcy filing have largely restretched the discount to NAV on the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( BTC )"" target=""_blank"">GBTC ), which had been substantially shrinking at the beginning of the year prior to the filing (see lower right of graphic below). Data by YCharts So where from here? Short-term indicators do signal Bitcoin is still overbought. But as detailed below, the eventual Genesis bankruptcy settlement should not add renewed selling pressures to Bitcoin or be that meaningful to the closely intertwined Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, especially in the medium-term. More broadly, there is now a better balance of buyers and sellers among Bitcoin traders following the initial FTX (FTT-USD) driven selloff in November and the period of deleveraging directly after that exchange's collapse. The FTX collapse actually tightened the supply of coins on exchanges as holders moved to cold storage in this cycle's ""not your keys, not your crypto"" moment. Coinbase ( COIN ) saw Bitcoins held on Coinbase Pro fall from over 600k to under 500K from the FTX bankruptcy. This move from exchanges, especially exchanges with yield programs like Gemini's, precipitated the current issue at Genesis and caused the general liquidity and duration mismatch at the lending institutions. And this tightening of supply has been partially sustained in recent weeks as a few hundred million dollars in shorts were liquidated with the move from $16k to $23k. Genesis Bankruptcy And The Digital Currency Group Fear based selling and forced selling were two of the key components of the 2022 contraction phase of the crypto cycle. While the Genesis bankruptcy news will continue to inject uncertainty and heighten fears of further contagion, the playout of the bankruptcy itself may not add substantial forced selling supply to either the Bitcoin market or GBTC shares. Below we briefly rehash the Genesis bankruptcy history, look at the ""First Day"" information and last week's pact with creditors, as well as provide color on the possible links to crypto sector prices. Genesis is a subsidiary of the Digital Currency Group which connectedly is also the parent of Grayscale, who sponsors the prominent Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. One arm of Genesis is among of the largest OTC trading desks for the crypto sector, handling over $170 billion in trade volume in 2021. The other arm was a sizeable institutional lender with $130 billion in loan originations in 2021. It is this lending arm that is directly listed in the bankruptcy, see grey shading below. Note the graphic only outlines the Genesis companies, specifically Genesis Global Holdco and its sub-entities. In addition to Genesis and Grayscale, Digital Currency Group subsidiaries include the Foundry, one of the largest Bitcoin mining pools, and CoinDesk, a top crypto sector media company. Plus DCG is invested in 200 companies and funds including well regarded Circle; a breakout of the portfolio is here . Genesis Structure (restructuring.ra.kroll.com) In November the Genesis lending arm paused withdrawals. The Three Arrows bankruptcy in July had left a billion dollar shortfall on the balance sheet that was only fully surfaced following the FTX and Alameda collapse. While the Genesis lending arm did not then still have exposure to Alameda, the FTX news heightened fears and precipitated a ""run on the banks"" scenario at the crypto lenders, including Genesis. Note that the Genesis trading arm, which initially was not part of the bankruptcy filing, does have $175 million in exposure to FTX. So how bad is it? The First Day Hearing Presentation roughly outlined both the assets and the obligations: Genesis Global Holdco Assets (restructuring.ra.kroll.com) Genesis Global Holdco Obligations (restructuring.ra.kroll.com) So two things jump out. First, depending on how the collateral tranches are being accounted, Genesis' obligations outweigh their assets by a few hundred million dollars. And second, as noted just above, half of Genesis' assets are, interestingly, liabilities of parent DCG. The quality and present value of the $1.1 billion DCG promissory note has been a point of contention with Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the majority owners of the Gemini exchange, a major creditor of Genesis. Note customers in Gemini's yield program have claims of about $780 million against Genesis. The Winklevoss twins' major concern is their contention that the DCG promissory note was represented to them as a current asset, even though it had a 2032 maturity. Though there are these legitimate questions about the promissory note, it is important to recall that this debt was created when DCG assumed the liabilities Three Arrows owed to Genesis. So in a prudential light, DCG assuming these liabilities has strengthened the recovery Genesis' creditors will receive. And while DCG is now on the creditors' committee of the Three Arrows liquidation proceedings, it seems unlikely they will recoup a meaningful percentage of the loans originally provided to Three Arrows by Genesis. Genesis Agreement With Creditors And DCG On February 6th Genesis announced an agreement in principle with DCG and a large group of creditors. The main upshot being DCG will exchange its $1.1 billion 2032 promissory note for newly issued convertible preferred stock. Details of the preferred stock plan can be found on pages 7-8 of the filed Restructuring Term Sheet . Additionally, DCG will be allowed to refinance its 2023 term loans through a new facility with a June 30th, 2024 maturity. Proposed New Second Lien Facility (assets.ctfassets.net) DCG is also providing its equity interest in the Genesis trading arm to the bankruptcy recovery, with plans to launch a sale process for this asset. For their part, Gemini agreed to provide up to $100 million to affected customers in its yield program. Takeaway: Agreement Buys Critical Time The short-term dominant factor for both Bitcoin and GBTC remains monetary policy and interest rate expectations. Last week I had a piece covering this topic titled The February Fed And 6 More Weeks Of Crypto Winter . The general idea is that we won't see a real pivot in Fed policy until there is sustained downward movement in the key, core services inflation metric. And Tuesday's CPI is just further indication that interest rate sensitive tech stocks and the crypto sector will be somewhat negatively influenced by the growing narrative of substantially higher rates for much longer than previously expected. For this reason I am a ""hold"" on large adds to most Bitcoin names, including the miners, with the near-term pricing above $21k. But GBTC is a different story. The Genesis bankruptcy drama has restretched the Trust's discount to NAV to 47%. However, the fears driving this divergence appear overblown. Grayscale is not directly touched in the Genesis restructuring agreement and fears DSG would somehow be forced to unwind any of the Grayscale products, thereby spiking coin supplies, now seem remote. If implemented, the agreement also buys DCG time before it is forced to sell a large portion of its own holdings in the Grayscale products at a discount. DCG along with its other subsidiaries are reportedly holding a billion dollars of the Bitcoin Trust. The refinancing of the May 2023 loans through June 2024 greatly reduces the need for immediate liquidity. It also allows time for the sale of other non-coin assets such as CoinDesk. The Financial Times has reported that DCG recently sold a portion of its Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ) holdings. But note, at $22 million dollars this is a relatively small percentage of their entire Grayscale holdings and their other sales were also concentrated in altcoin holdings, rather than Bitcoin. Further, time is critical as Grayscale is litigating against the SEC over the ability to convert their Bitcoin Trust to an ETF. Converting to an ETF would provide a mechanism through redemptions to reverse the discount to NAV. Oral arguments are set for March 7th and a ruling is expected in the second quarter. This litigation is just the first bite at the reversing the discount to NAV apple, but neutral legal pundits are somewhat surprisingly favoring Grayscale's argument in the lawsuit. Put simply, Grayscale's main contention is that the SEC acted arbitrarily in treating Grayscale's ETF conversion proposal differently than ""similarly situated"" Bitcoin futures ETFs. If the Exchange's surveillance-sharing agreement with the CME is sufficient to detect and deter fraudulent or manipulative activity in spot bitcoin markets, then spot bitcoin ETPs and bitcoin futures ETPs are equally protected from such activity. Grayscale v. SEC, Brief of Petitioner , 10/11/22, p. 32 In any case, the coming year should bring increased clarity of how Grayscale plans to implement a mechanism that would naturally reverse the discount to NAV on its Bitcoin Trust. As importantly, fears over Grayscale's general relationship to the Genesis bankruptcy, along with concerns DCG will be a large forced seller of GBTC shares as part of the bankruptcy restructuring, likely prove overblown. The agreement even closely aligns the creditors with the longer-term success of DCG and Grayscale. Because of its current 47% discount to NAV, I am reaffirming my ""buy"" rating upgrade from December on GBTC for those with an adequately long investment horizon. Risks remain elevated, but compensation though the discount appears overlarge. My new marketplace service is coming soon. Complete Crypto Analytics is launching in the near future and will provide model allocations for Bitcoin and Bitcoin adjacent names such as GBTC and the miners.

District Judge Lewis Kaplan, of the Southern District of New York, originally ruled in favor of news organizations, including CoinDesk, which argued the names of Bankman-Fried's signers were in the public interest, but did not rule pending an appeal. While Bankman-Fried's attorneys filed a notice that they would appeal, they did not file the actual appeal, the judge said in a new ruling Wednesday.  The signers were revealed to be Stanford University's Andreas Paepcke and Larry Kramer, who put up $200,000 and $500,000, respectively. Bankman-Fried's parents are both Stanford instructors. Paepcke is a senior research scientist while Kramer is a former dean of Stanford Law School.  Kramer told CoinDesk it was his friendship with Bankman-Fried's parents, Barbara Fried and Joseph Bankman, that led him to post bail for the now-disgraced former FTX CEO.  ""Joe Bankman and Barbara Fried have been close friends of my wife and I since the mid-1990s. During the past two years, while my family faced a harrowing battle with cancer, they have been the truest of friends – bringing food, providing moral support and frequently stepping in at moment's notice to help. In turn, we have sought to support them as they face their own crisis,"" Kramer said in a statement provided to CoinDesk.  ""My actions are in my personal capacity, and I have no business dealings or interest in this matter other than to help our loyal and steadfast friends. Nor do I have any comment or position regarding the substance of the legal matter itself, which is what the trial will be for,"" Kramer added.""  Paepcke did not immediately return CoinDesk's request for comment.  Bankman-Fried was arrested in December but released on a $250 million bond. His parents signed for the bond, putting their Stanford home up as collateral. The names of the other two signers were initially redacted.  UPDATE (Feb. 15, 2023, 18:47 UTC):Adds additional details.

42411211,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMCgk,1676484223,Is the SEC Really the Bad Guy?,"They say time moves faster in crypto, and I’m not sure anyone feels that more than we journalists. We’re tasked with keeping track of more or less everything that’s going on, and tuning out for even a few days can leave you feeling so behind there’s no hope of catching up.  I’ve been living that relentless reality for months, between untangling the downfall of FTX and launching CoinDesk’s new ”Crypto Crooks” podcast. There wasn’t much “holiday” to my holidays. So I was incredibly grateful to finally take a few days off last week to spend with family and unwind.  It turns out that, as the old saying goes, I picked the wrong week to stop sniffing glue.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  While I was taking a breather, events unfolded that were exceptional even in crypto terms. The continued ascendance of Ordinal inscriptions on Bitcoin has fascinating and potentially major implications, and in a different moment it would be the most important story going.  Instead, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken center stage with major enforcement actions that many are interpreting as part of a blunt-force effort to marginalize the entire crypto industry. It continued Wednesday morning with news of proposed new rules that would prevent registered investment advisors (RIA) from engaging with many existing crypto custodial services.  After a year in which frauds and charlatans stole or destroyed tens of billions of dollars in investor funds, the SEC has focused much of its crackdown on entities that many crypto veterans would consider “the good guys,” and on services that are far less obviously dangerous than those that ran wild in 2021 and 2022. That reality holds many difficult lessons about the broader pattern of U.S. crypto and financial regulation.  That’s especially true of moves against the U.S.-based exchange Kraken, which paid $30 million in an SEC settlement and agreed to shutter its U.S. staking services. For many, the action feels woefully misplaced: Kraken has been a pillar of the crypto ecosystem for a decade and has been a consistently honest actor.  The particular tool in question may not have been structured ideally – it seems it was more vulnerable to attack as a “security” because it wasn’t a straight fee-based pass-through for stakers. But the core service being provided was fundamentally valid and useful for the ecosystem, and entirely distinct from the “lending platforms” like Celsius Network and Voyager Digital that blew up last year.  The parallel actions against the BUSD stablecoin feel only slightly less misdirected. The SEC reportedly plans to sue Paxos, the issuer of the Binance-branded stablecoin, which the regulator considers an unregistered security. Paxos says it will halt issuance of the token. Binance, the largest offshore crypto exchange, doesn’t have quite the pedigree of Kraken, particularly since it’s a lightly regulated entity. But Binance has been a broadly good actor for half a decade.  More to the point, BUSD may be the victim of some fuzziness around the concept of a “stablecoin.” Both regulators and crypto insiders are likely still traumatized by the incredibly violent collapse last spring of terraUSD, a “stablecoin” built on faulty ideas about algorithmic price stabilization. But BUSD is a backed stablecoin, with dollars in a bank guaranteeing redemptions.  The obvious read here is that there’s some political expediency at play. These actions come after a year in which the SEC failed to spot or prevent massive frauds – a year in which, in fact, SEC Chief Gary Gensler was seen by some as unusually chummy with one of the biggest fraudsters. Cracking down on Kraken and Paxos is hard not to see as, to some degree, making a show of enforcement on targets of convenience. Dissenting SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce is among those who share that general view.  But there’s little point whining about the SEC’s post-facto virtue-signaling – the agency has the power, and seems unlikely to change its stripes any time soon. There’s more alpha in engaging with the realpolitik of its operative logic than in grousing about how unfair it is. That’s especially true because, well, there really was a lot of embarrassing and damaging crypto fraud last year. As Bloomberg’s Matt Levine points out, even the most reasonable counterpoints to misplaced regulation are going to fall on deaf ears once people lose enough money.  It’s hard to dispute that the 2021 bubble led investors, builders and the media to feed retail hype and treat a series of con men-like heroes. The whiff of money, as it always seems to, blunted critical faculties and pumped hopium into the vents.  So while the SEC’s crackdown is likely to put a lot of misplaced burdens on entities that are substantially blameless, the crypto industry as a whole still needs to look inward and reckon with its own responsibility – and ask how it can better marginalize frauds on the front lines the next time mass crypto-mania returns.

42411215,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMCty,1676483520,Crypto CEOs Need to Accept That Existing Regulations Also Apply to Them,"Brian Armstrong is wrong: Staking is a security and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) just proved it. He just misunderstood their position. This is where the lack of understanding of regulations on the crypto side is starting to get concerning. If we saw the same level of ignorance of the law in banking board rooms as we’ve seen with crypto executives, we would be excused for withdrawing most of our money and putting it in a safe.  The Coinbase CEO’s preemptive reaction to the SEC action against rival exchange Kraken's crypto staking shows both a lack of knowledge about what a security is as well as a lack of basic knowledge about when securities laws apply and when they do not. It’s time for crypto executives to stop grandstanding and start getting better, unbiased legal advice.  Timothy Cradle is the director of regulatory affairs at Blockchain Intelligence Group.  Based on the responses from Armstrong and other crypto executives and decision-makers regarding regulations, it is clear many of them do not seem to understand that they are providing regulated services in a non-compliant manner. In the specific case to which Armstrong reacted before the facts were in, the SEC charged Kraken because it was paying interest on deposit accounts. That is a regulated activity that the SEC provides certain exemptions for, e.g., banks don’t have to register with the commission to pay interest on a savings account; it is certainly not the case that crypto companies are exempted from registering for paying interest to depositors just because the deposits are in crypto, as Brian Armstrong seems to assume.  Not only is that not the case, but this is also not the first time the SEC has successfully made this case in the form of an enforcement action. In 2022 BlockFI was fined for providing a similar service – paying interest on deposits – without registering with the commission. Coinbase, itself, received a letter from the SEC warning them away from providing a similar service to BlockFI. So why is it the case that Coinbase’s CEO does not seem to remember this and does not think the rules that apply to other financial services apply to his financial service?  It is either intentional ignorance or literal ignorance. Both are a concern when the future of a multi-billion-dollar financial services company is at stake.  Crypto 'regulation by enforcement' is simply not a thing  The problem is the pernicious concept in crypto that goes under the name “regulation by enforcement.” We need to excise this phrase from crypto, not just because it is imprecise but because it simply is not a thing. Regulators in the U.S. are not creating new rules; they are enforcing existing rules. Perhaps crypto executives need a quick refresher on the law and rule-making process:  1. A bill is proposed  2. The bill goes to committee  3. A bill is voted on  4. The bill is signed into law  5. Regulators write rules to match the intent of the law  6. A comment period is open to the public (no tweets accepted)  7. A final rule is written and published in the Federal Register  There is more nuance to the process, but that is it in a nutshell – it is a multi-year process on average, and that is how regulations are made. Precedent can be set with litigation by the regulators, but again, this action is not rule-making; this is enforcing existing rules.  If regulators have thus far been successful in obtaining enforcements then this should be a huge wake-up call to the crypto industry that financial transactions in crypto conform to regulated financial transactions and, as such, the existing rules apply. If their legal counsel is telling them otherwise, then it is time to get new legal counsel because this is a multi-million dollar lesson that the industry keeps learning and will keep learning until they make a change in strategy. A new lawyer won’t cost as much.  We’re starting to get a growing list of crypto services where one might ask: Is it regulated? And based on the enforcement actions we can say: Yes, unequivocally. Here are some examples:  Staking: Kraken enforcement action 2023  Rewards: BlockFI enforcement action 2021  Lending: Coinbase legal warning from the SEC 2021  Token issuance: Telegram (TON) settlement with the SEC in 2020  Crypto-based derivatives trading: Ooki DAO lawsuit from Commodity Futures Trading Commission 2022  All of these enforcement actions involve regulated activities; and there will be more settlements and enforcement actions to come.  Regulatory clarity is a simple hurdle to clear  Soon we’ll see definitive proof that tokens themselves are unregistered securities when the SEC wins the Ripple case. As if we didn’t already know that via multiple comments from SEC officials.  In the year to come we’ll have more concrete proof that certain crypto services are unregistered futures and derivatives exchanges – based on comments made by CFTC Chair Benham as he ramps up the enforcement division of the commission to set precedents by targeting non-compliant crypto exchanges.  Will it take multiple business failures to convince the crypto industry to mature and take their regulatory reality more seriously in the U.S.? Possibly. What we’ve seen in the past few months from regulators are existential challenges to the crypto industry: The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Reserve Board are warning banks away; and Kraken and BlockFI have each received cease-and-desist orders for product lines in the past year. In the past month, we’ve also seen the TZero crypto app (an Overstock product) deciding to discontinue services due to regulatory challenges related to failures in their customer disclosures.  There is one argument in crypto regulation that makes sense: the need for regulatory clarity – though, even this is diminishing with ever more enforcement actions. We may need to trade the bad phrase “regulation by enforcement” for “regulatory clarity by enforcement.” At least the latter is something less difficult to argue against. In other words, why not just continue to ask regulators to state clearly what the rules are instead of begging them to stop suing you?  Regulatory clarity is a simple hurdle to clear. We’ve seen this with money-laundering regulation. In 2019 FinCEN issued FIN-2019-G001, FinCEN’s guidance on the “Application of FinCEN’s Regulations to Certain Business Models Involving Convertible Virtual Currencies.” Since 2019 there has been nothing in the U.S. with the same level of explicit detail stating how rules apply to crypto and under what circumstances. As a result, we see every crypto company, with few exceptions, registered as a money services business and adhering to the five pillars of Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) compliance.  With the SEC and CFTC, where there is no such explicit guidance, we see continued non-registration and consequent enforcement actions, settlements and cease-and-desist orders. There’s a clear causal relationship here between guidance and compliance.  Therefore, it is time for crypto executives and decision makers to think critically about regulations, stop complaining, hire better legal and compliance personnel who will tell them the hard truths (you are regulated, time to register), and have a more productive dialogue with regulators than they’ve had to date.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Timothy Cradle,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/02/15/crypto-ceos-need-to-accept-that-existing-regulations-also-apply-to-them,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a5596b24c19d1f8cc3604bbfb1d3ac5bbd61ae95-3000x2130.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The proposal was submitted by Lido DAO’s financial unit, Steakhouse Financial, and considers four treasury-related proposals, including whether the DAO should sell or stake the 20,304 ether (worth about $30 million) it holds in its treasury, diversify its stablecoin holdings and sell its protocol surplus of staked ether to finance operating expenses.  The token, LDO, was up 18% early Wednesday and has since retreated to around 10% higher on the day. LDO has gained 30% in a month and witnessed a rally late last week after the news that U.S.-based crypto exchange Kraken had settled with the Securities and Exchange Commission to sunset its crypto staking service in the U.S.  Ethereum staking is the process of locking up an amount of ETH for a specified period of time in order to contribute to the security of the blockchain and earn network rewards. Lido DAO enables non-custodial staking which means users can stake their locked Ethereum into other protocols.

A panel of Dutch judges at the East Brabant Court agreed that the Russian web developer could flee or seek to hide evidence if freed on bail. Pertsev has denied the charges against him. His next hearing will take place in late April.  Pertsev was arrested in August, just days after the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned the anonymizing tool for crypto transactions, which it says was used to fund North Korean hackers. Under the Dutch system of pre-trial detention, charges against Pertsev were not unveiled until a November court hearing.  Dutch public prosecutor Martine Boerlage alleged that, rather than merely publishing code, Pertsev and others ran Tornado like a business, comparing them to bank clerks accepting piles of suspicious cash without question.  Pertsev’s arrest has drawn protests from Edward Snowden and the local crypto community, while the OFAC sanctions have drawn criticism from privacy and crypto advocates.

42411221,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMDH7,1676479500,Let’s Talk About Bitcoin’s Price-to-Earnings Ratio,"One of the things I enjoy most about penning this column is the ability to engage with readers and join them on a journey of learning more about this nascent asset class of crypto. Sure I know some stuff, but there is still plenty to explore. Of particular interest to me is tying crypto to my background in traditional finance (TradFi).  I used to be an equity research analyst. My focus was on valuation. I always viewed getting valuation “right” as being of paramount importance and tried to answer two related questions:  What’s an entity worth?  Is it trading above or below that amount?  If a company was trading below the projected market value, I’d rate it a “buy.” If it was trading above – well, in all candor, I’d usually find another company to cover, rather than rating it a “sell.” A number of dynamics exist in sell-side equity research that lead to those types of decisions, and perhaps I’ll discuss them in a future column.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  I employed a combination of fundamental and technical analysis, exploring both absolute and relative valuation techniques. Absolute valuations were based on the level of cash flows that the company was generating, and relative valuations were based on its value relative to a similar entity, or itself at a prior time.  Unlike companies, bitcoin (BTC) and many other crypto assets don’t generate cash flows upon which to base a fundamental analysis. But bitcoin isn’t a company. Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer cash system that allows the transfer of value from one entity to the next, without the need for third party validation. People see value in that, so valuations should be explored.  Given that it has a fixed supply, some also view bitcoin as a hedge against the devaluation of fiat currency or against the actions of inept central banks. I view it as both, as well as a viable asset class where I choose to store some capital.  Over in equities, price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios are a common relative valuation metric. There are better valuation techniques, but it provides a quick comparison that tells you how much is being paid for a company versus how much it is earning. The crypto version of P/E is the Network Value to Transaction (NVT) ratio. The metric, created by cryptocurrency analyst Willy Woo, measures the relationship between market capitalization and network transfer volume. Transfer volume is analogous to earnings, and is simply a count of how much bitcoin is moved from one address to another.  In my view, for P/E and NVT to be comparable you must decide that observers value something about both. For companies (and therefore P/E), shareholders value earnings. For BTC (and therefore NVT), it’s the ability to store value in a digital asset, which I view as space on the blockchain itself. And as demand for that space grows, the value of bitcoin increases. If you can get your arms around that, then the NVT ratio is worth including in your analytic framework.  High NVT ratios indicate that investors are valuing bitcoin at a premium. Low NVT ratios indicate the opposite, potentially making a crypto asset alluring to value investors who like to buy things at discounted prices.  But what numbers mean high or low? And when did those readings occur? Given the age of cryptocurrencies, it’s quite possible that what was overvalued in one period, may not be in another. It also makes sense to look at where they are relative to past history. And, once again, it also makes sense to condense it over particular time periods. What is overvalued in one time period may not be in another.  The highest NVT ratio for bitcoin that I found on record was 448.15 on Aug. 29, 2010. Was it overvalued? Well, BTC traded for about 6 cents at the time, and is around $22,000 now, so the relevance of this reading is a bit dubious in my opinion. What if we toss out all data before 2014? That gives a maximum NVT ratio of 98.52, which I think is more sensible. Bitcoin’s lowest NVT on record was 0.22 on Jan. 24, 2016, when BTC was trading at $403. The average NVT over the time span studied was 24, which I also think has relevance.  BTC’s current NVT is 44.89, an 82% premium versus its average since 2014. But it’s at a 20% discount to its 30-, 60- and 90-day moving averages. It makes sense to me that the average premium ascribed to a newer technology like the Bitcoin blockchain, and newer assets like bitcoin itself, would increase over time. It also makes sense to me that its extremes on both the high and low end would narrow, which is what we’ve seen with the data.  Ultimately the position that one takes on the current NVT level will depend on what you anchor to. Those looking over the entirety of BTC’s trading history may see it as overpriced. But a more narrow look shows that BTC may indeed be trading at a compelling valuation.  Takeaways  From CoinDesk’s Nick Baker, here’s some recent news worth reading:  BIG WEEK: No exaggeration, this felt like a giant week in the Crypto Regulation by Enforcement Era. Kraken agreed to shut down its U.S. staking service (news that CoinDesk broke first) to settle Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charges that the operation was offering unregistered securities to customers. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong discussed his unease with any staking crackdown, and SEC Chair Gary Gensler sent a pretty clear warning that Coinbase (and others) should pay attention to the Kraken case. Then, Paxos, facing regulatory scrutiny, said it would stop issuing Binance’s stablecoin, BUSD. It’s hard to fathom that this is the last we’ll hear about efforts to curtail crypto in the wake of the FTX disaster.  GOOD NEWS? At the core of crypto is the ethos that decentralization is better than the alternative. Bitcoin, after all, was born right after the 2008 financial crisis, when the Federal Reserve and other central banks poured money into the financial system to save it – something that rankled some people who became crypto’s earliest backers. The SEC’s apparent effort to get centralized exchanges out of the staking game might actually be good news for crypto folks who like decentralization because individual efforts to stake are seemingly unaffected by the regulatory efforts.  BANKING CONUNDRUM: A longstanding issue for crypto is getting linked into the conventional banking system. That’s never been particularly easy. And it seems to be getting harder, posing another obstacle besides the staking issue blocking the industry from mainstream adoption.  RUSSIAN SANCTIONS: An excellent deep-dive investigation by CoinDesk shows how Russians are raising money via crypto to supply troops fighting in Ukraine – sidestepping sanctions. Just add it to this week’s long list of ways crypto is playing with fire (the conventional global regulatory regime).",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,"Glenn Williams Jr., Nick Baker",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/02/15/crypto-long-short-sorting-out-bitcoins-pe-ratio,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/45fefcdb9678b32425a19c0bcca7aa41377eac64-6000x3376.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Court-appointed joint provisional liquidators in the Bahamas said that $5.6 billion was transferred from Bahamas unit FTX Digital's custodial accounts to U.S. entity FTX trading, while another $2.1 billion was transferred to FTX's U.S. trading arm, Alameda Research.  ""And then we have other tangible assets of about $3 million, mostly relating to office furniture, equipment and the fleet of cars that the employees had in the Bahamas,"" Christopher Shore, a lawyer for the liquidator, said during the hearing.

""The cooperation agreement is a starting point. But the issues as to whether assets belong in the Bahamian estate or in the U.S. estate are open issues.

The native token of the now-defunct crypto lender once traded at an all-time-high of $8.02 – which regulators and Celsius’ independent examiner now say was the result of price manipulation meant to benefit insiders, including former CEO Alex Mashinsky.  In the wake of the revelations, lawyers for Celsius are wrestling with how to compensate CEL token holders without rewarding insiders who have enormous CEL holdings.  “I don’t think we’ve reached a 100% final conclusion there, but given the fact that the examiner report reveals in great detail how the price of CEL token was manipulated, we’ve really struggled with how to treat the CEL token and what is a fair value to ascribe to it,” Celsius’ lead attorney, Kirkland & Ellis's Ross Kwasteniet, told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn.  “It’s our intention to suppress or subordinate the CEL token claims of insiders who were involved in the manipulation of the CEL token price,” Kwasteniet added. “It’s our intention that they would not receive any recovery or distribution on account of the CEL token.”  Celsius’ lawyers added that, if the estate were to value CEL tokens at the price of the petition date, it would take away value from the recovery given to holders of other cryptocurrencies.  Celsius customers attending the Wednesday hearing were not happy with the suggested recovery price.  “I would just hope that [the Unsecured Creditors Committee] take into consideration that a lot of the retail users did not buy [CEL] at 20 cents.

The first season of the women's version of the multibillion-dollar Indian Premier League men's tournament will be held March 4-26.  CoinDesk spoke to representatives of three franchises; all declined to comment.  The news was reported earlier by CricBuzz, which cited a 68-page document called a ""Commercial Workbook"" that the board shared with the franchises.  According to CricBuzz, the workbook says: ""No Franchisee shall undertake a partnership or any kind of association with an entity that is in any way connected/related to an entity that is involved/operates, directly or indirectly, in the cryptocurrency sector.""  The previous edition of the Indian Premier League, one of the nation's most-watched sporting events, saw some of India's biggest film stars, including Amitabh Bachchan, Ranveer Singh and Salman Khan appear in crypto-related promotions or advertisements.  Since then, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has cited concerns about misleading the ""youth through over-promising and non-transparent advertising.""  Early in 2022, India cracked down on crypto with stiff taxes on crypto and guidelines on crypto advertisements. The country is now waiting for consensus on crypto regulation to emerge in the world's biggest economies at Group of 20 (G-20) meetings. India is president of the G-20 this year.  The Indian sports' stance follows last year's partnership between the International Cricket Council (ICC), which governs cricket worldwide, and the now-defunct FTX cryptocurrency exchange, as an official cryptocurrency exchange partner for ICC events. FTX logos were visible throughout the ICC's T20 Cricket World Cup, one of the most watched sporting events globally, but were dropped for the tournament's final as the exchange collapsed.  The BCCI warning says that a breach could lead to punitive measures and instructed teams to submit copies of all commercial agreements 10 days before the start of the WPL season, according to CricBuzz. The BCCI also warned against any links to entities involved in gambling and the tobacco sector.

42411217,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMD0a,1676474886,Security Tokens and Tokenized Securities Are Not the Same Thing,"Tokenization is back. Some of you may remember the heyday of 2017-18, when everything was going to be tokenized and put on the blockchain. Banks were lining up to launch proofs of concept but clients were thin on the ground. Now, experimentation has spread well beyond the initial cohort, and even regulators are turning their attention to the topic.  Along with greater interest comes greater confusion. You’ve probably noticed that sometimes the assets in question are called “security tokens” and sometimes they’re “tokenized securities.” Now, most people won’t care what they’re called – it’s the idea that matters, right? We’ll sort out the terminology later. Pedants like me, however, exist to point out that ‘nope, terminology does matter,’ even from the beginning. Here’s why.  First, the two terms do not refer to the same thing:  Security tokens are tokens that share some characteristics with securities. To get more technical, they are blockchain-based representations of certain privileges such as revenue sharing, access, governance rights or a combination of these and others, and because of their incentive structure are likely to be classified as securities.  Tokenized securities are securities that move on blockchains. They are tokens that represent either specific off-chain assets, or that mimic established asset groups such as bonds, shares or funds.  Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.  All tokenized securities could be classified as security tokens, but not all security tokens are tokenized securities. By lumping the terms together we are blurring the distinction, and this hurts the broader understanding of the underlying potential and hinders classification attempts, which in turn impacts both regulation and investment.  What’s the difference?  Security tokens are a new concept. They are created on-chain, for on-chain purposes, and do things that haven’t been done before on rails that didn’t exist until a few years ago. They enable new forms of financing, user engagement, investor reward, project governance and much more. We haven’t even begun to scratch the surface of how the concept can influence the evolution and implementation of ideas.  Tokenized securities are an old concept in a new wrapper. They take existing formats and add additional conveniences such as improved settlement, greater transparency, more flexibility and a broader reach. They are also undergoing a dizzying burst of experimentation: Over the past couple of months, we’ve seen financial institutions and official organizations not just trialing but actually issuing shares, credit notes, municipal bonds, development bonds, funds, commercial paper and gold on blockchains.  Read more: Noelle Acheson - Bitcoin, Markets and the Symmetry of Information  Security tokens, however, are struggling amid a lack of regulatory clarity, and the all-too-familiar regulation-by-enforcement approach of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). To pick an example, starting in 2016 LBRY – a decentralized storage protocol and media service – financed its development through the issue of LBC tokens, which would enable access and engagement once the platform was up and running. For many, these were obviously utility tokens since they enabled use of the service. For the SEC, they were security tokens since their issue financed the project. In 2021 the regulator brought an enforcement action against LBRY. The issuer pushed back, but in November a judge ruled in the SEC’s favor.  The two concepts on the surface may appear similar but lift the lid and you can see that the difference is stark: It’s about clarity and establishment support versus the lack thereof. It’s also about development. With security tokens, the fear of SEC reprisals is holding back many worthwhile projects from testing out ideas in the market, while tokenized securities are getting busy.  Why it matters  This brings us to one of the main reasons the distinction is important: the divergent regulatory approaches. Tokenized securities are unlikely to attract much attention other than classification tweaks and requirements that custody practices check the right boxes. International regulators are working on explicit rules to deal with the adaptation of securities to blockchains, and along with official support will come even more establishment experimentation and eventually client demand.  Security tokens are somewhat contentious, however. The process initiated against LBRY, mentioned above, took almost two years to work through the courts; the SEC’s case against Ripple for allegedly issuing unregistered securities is now in its third year. In the U.S. judicial system precedents matter, but imagine the sheer consumption of legal resources should more SEC targets decide to push back. This is unsustainable, but until the U.S. regulators understand this, progress is hindered.  Read more: Noelle Acheson - Why Crypto Is Not an 'Industry'  The distinction also matters from an investment point of view. Conflating the terms implies an establishment acceptance of security tokens that is not yet there. It also underplays the innovative potential of security tokens by suggesting they are merely securities on a blockchain.  Don’t get me wrong: Tokenization of securities is exciting, and the recent activity around the concept is the welcome result of years of solid behind-the-scenes work by developers, market infrastructure firms, banks and financial overseers. The tokenization of securities is one of the main vectors through which crypto markets will transform traditional markets.  Security tokens, however, have an even loftier goal. Once the legal parameters are worked out they could end up impacting much more than markets: They could end up transforming conventional concepts of investment and engagement, possibly unleashing not only new business models but also new sources of value.  In sum, tokenized securities and security tokens are similar on the surface. But looking deeper, they have significant differences that are worth acknowledging.

The judge sided with representatives for FTX, who previously argued there was no need to appoint an examiner to ""conduct yet another costly investigation that would slow the progress of these cases.""

The move is part of a broader plan. Last year, Lido said it will reward staked ether (stETH) liquidity providers on Arbitrum and Optimism with a cumulative 150,000 LDO tokens, Lido’s governance token, to attract users to the service.  Optimism is a speedy and low-cost blockchain that works atop Ethereum, helping to scale the network. Liquid staking refers to the exchange of staked ether for tokenized versions of ether that can be used in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications such as Lido. Uses range from using these tokens as collateral for loans or margin trading to earning yields of up to 6% as of Wednesday.  Lido and Optimism aim to increase the availability of wrapped staked ether (wstETH) with OP tokens through the new liquidity mining and user incentives program. wstETH is a tokenized version of ether equal to the value of ether locked by a user on Lido.  “Liquid staking tokens are an essential money lego for the DeFi ecosystem,” Jacob Blish, head of business development at Lido, told CoinDesk in a statement. “The value of wstETH on Optimism is that it further democratizes access to liquid staking for those who do not want to pay or cannot afford to pay mainnet fees.”  Starting Wednesday, the program will see 1 million OP tokens distributed over a six-month period.  Lido will also continue to supply LDO rewards for these pools as part of the LidoOnLayer2 – a separate initiative that rewards users who use tokenized ether for applications on other blockchains.  Lido and Optimism plan to distribute these OP tokens as rewards for liquidity providers on decentralized exchanges Beethoven X, Curve, KyberSwap, Uniswap and Velodrome. Additional rewards are planned for wstETH usage on lending and borrowing such as Aave.  Layer 2 networks such as Optimism are increasingly popular entry points into the Ethereum ecosystem.

42412863,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6foy,1676473200,SEC Proposal Could Bar Investment Advisers From Keeping Assets at Crypto Firms,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposed a rule that would effectively require registered investment advisors (RIA) to go outside the crypto industry for storing digital assets, according to its first formal policy push that leans heavily into the cryptocurrency sector.  The rule, approved in a 4-1 vote by the SEC on Wednesday, would expand the agency’s existing regulations that say an investment adviser needs to keep customers’ money and securities with a “qualified custodian.” The new version, if approved, would grow that safeguarding requirement to any assets that investment advisers are entrusted with – including crypto.  Right now, crypto trading and lending platforms routinely offer custody for crypto customers, but they're not “qualified custodians” under this rule. An appropriate custodian under SEC’s regulations would generally mean a chartered bank or trust company, a broker-dealer registered with the SEC or a futures commission merchant registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  While officials said the rule wasn’t specific to crypto, the industry featured heavily in formal remarks previewing it.  “Make no mistake: Based upon how crypto platforms generally operate, investment advisers cannot rely on them as qualified custodians,” SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement. “Though some crypto trading and lending platforms may claim to custody investors’ crypto, that does not mean they are qualified custodians.”  Apart from demanding that investment advisers trust only regulated financial institutions with their customers’ money – mostly leaving crypto businesses on the outside – the SEC’s proposal also says those qualified custodians would be subject to independent audits, regular disclosures and would need to segregate customer assets into accounts under the customers’ identity.  Gensler’s agency is exercising a power granted under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, an overhaul of the regulatory landscape ushered in after the last widespread financial collapse. SEC officials said the agency has been working on this proposal for a long time, not in response to any of crypto’s recent spectacles, though the SEC has reportedly been scrutinizing crypto custodial issues recently.  “Rather than properly segregating investors’ crypto, these platforms have commingled those assets with their own crypto or other investors’ crypto,” Gensler said. “When these platforms go bankrupt – something we’ve seen time and again recently – investors’ assets often have become property of the failed company, leaving investors in line at the bankruptcy court.”  One of the commissioners, Mark Uyeda, raised a key point for crypto: If the agency is trying to force advisers to go to banks with their clients' crypto assets, and the bank regulators are cautioning banks against crypto activity, is it making crypto investing impossible through the advisers? He said the proposal in multiple ways seems to ""mask a policy decision"" to block crypto activity, though he initially chose to support it.  Commissioner Hester Peirce opposed Wednesday's proposal, finding fault with several aspects including its one-year implementation period for the largest advisers, which she argued “seems too short to accomplish all of it.” She also criticized potential harm to the crypto sector, saying one of the effects would be “likely shrinking the ranks of qualified crypto custodians,” and that the rule seemed designed to force advisers to back away from industry ties immediately.  When asked whether the regulator had gathered any data to illustrate the scale of digital assets tied to registered investment adviser clients, officials at the agency said they hadn’t. They could only confirm that advisers do represent some segment of the assets now held at crypto firms.  Read More: A Call to the SEC: Treat Crypto Assets as if Clients Matter  So the actual effect of the proposal isn’t clear. If it’s eventually approved as an official rule, it may not significantly change the industry’s status with the U.S. securities regulator, which already considers the sector’s trading platforms to be generally out of compliance.  In some ways, Gensler’s own crypto rhetoric makes this proposal less dramatic. The SEC chairman has already said most tokens are securities that should be registered. Under the existing rules for investment advisers, securities already need to be in the hands of ""qualified custodians."" So in Gensler's view, the current standards already affect the vast majority of digital assets.  If he's right, this revision effort just swoops in and makes sure there's no crypto asset left out.  The latest proposed rule leaves some questions about the role of companies like Anchorage Digital, which is a crypto-oriented trust regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), or state-chartered institutions such as those in Wyoming. SEC officials said as long as a company can meet a list of requirements, they can seek to act as a qualified custodian.  Proposed rules don't always make it to the finish line. The agency is scheduling a 60-day comment period during which the crypto industry is certain to make itself heard. The SEC will have to review and consider the outside input, which is typically a months-long process. The SEC will then have to write and approve a final version of the rule before it can be implemented.  The SEC has sought public input on custody issues before, such as a request for comment in 2020 after Wyoming said a state-regulated entity may be a qualified custodian. No formal policies were proposed at the end of that comment period.

42411203,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMCQD,1676471557,The SEC Is Taking Aim at Paxos and (Annoyingly) It’s Good for Bitcoin,"Chalk up another point for the regulators as the crypto onslaught continues. I hate to make this about Bitcoin, but I will. Because in a way, this is about Bitcoin.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reportedly plans to sue crypto firm Paxos for violating investor protection laws because the firm issues, maintains and white labels Binance USD (BUSD). The SEC alleges that BUSD, a U.S. dollar stablecoin with Binance branding, is an unregistered security.  And while it seems bad for BUSD and Paxos, it’s good for Bitcoin. Leave it to the Bitcoin maximalist, I guess.  Never mind if it makes a shred of sense that something with no expectation of profit can be deemed a security (U.S. dollar stablecoins are not interest-bearing and they are pegged at $1), Paxos still decided to stop minting the stablecoin starting Feb. 21 at the direction of the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). Paxos has since said it “categorically disagrees” with the SEC on the point that BUSD is a security and is “prepared to vigorously litigate if necessary.”  Points were also recently awarded to the regulators following crypto exchange Kraken’s settlement with the SEC last week on charges it was offering unregistered securities through a staking-as-a-service platform, and after Wyoming-based Custodia Bank was denied membership to the Federal Reserve System in late January for being a risk to the banking system since it aims to serve crypto clients.  Again, nevermind if the regulation makes a shred of sense. It is regulation nonetheless.  No regulation for you, Bitcoin  What’s missing from the regulators’ recent push is anything that represents a direct attack on Bitcoin. Sure, there are warnings of market volatility, and a lot of Bitcoin’s most-used trading pairs feature the stablecoins regulators are focused on. But putting Bitcoin in a chokehold isn’t a priority. That’s mostly because it would be quite difficult to do so.  For all the issues Bitcoin’s decentralized design presents, there isn’t a central company or individual that a government can pinpoint for a targeted regulatory push as it can for stablecoins (e.g., Paxos, Circle) or staking providers (e.g., Kraken, Coinbase). And for the Bitcoin-related companies or individuals it could pick out and somehow buffet, the network is decentralized enough that it would take the battering in stride. It would take a widespread, highly coordinated and expensive attack to meaningfully slow down the Bitcoin network.  As such, Bitcoin as a network will be largely uninhibited by this regulatory push.  Tick tock, next block.  No one should be surprised that regulators are regulating  That said, maybe Bitcoin regulation isn’t completely off the table after the Biden administration published a call to action to regulate the industry thoroughly, titled “The Administration’s Roadmap to Mitigate Cryptocurrencies’ Risks” on Jan. 27. Looking back at this, no one should have really been surprised with new crypto regulatory action.  Read more: Who’s Surprised by the SEC’s ‘Power Grab?’ | Opinion  The White House’s relatively short online post notes stablecoins twice: In the first instance it is enclosed in what must be scare quotes in reference to terraUSD, which collapsed; and in the second instance it linked to a (very long) Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) October 2022 report on digital asset financial stability risks and regulation. The FSOC report specifically makes the case for robust regulation of stablecoin issuers’ reserve assets and banks’, credit unions’ and trust companies’ interactions with crypto – using the term “stablecoin” over 170 times in its 124 pages.  Now the regulators are taking direct action against the providers of stablecoins they deem to have opaque reserve practices – the custodial staking service providers like Kraken and the banks looking to service crypto companies like Custodia before they get too big and intertwined with the noncrypto financial system.  Yet, even though the keen observer shouldn’t be surprised by the recent regulatory moves they need not be happy with or satisfied with the regulation.  No one should be satisfied, even if you’re a Bitcoiner  From the same White House blog post:  “Safeguards will ensure that new technologies are secure and beneficial to all – and that the new digital economy works for the many, not just the few.”  I want to put aside the staking provider conversation to focus on the consequences of policies aimed at Paxos and stablecoins instead. With stablecoins as the focus, the White House’s sentiment encapsulated in the above quote is perfect, and you’d be hard-pressed to find anyone who could argue against it in good faith. Expanding access to sound financial services empowers people, which raises the quality of life across the board. But sentiment needs to be met with action to mean anything.  Forcing stablecoin issuers like Paxos to operate with almost unsettling transparency would be a good thing as long as it doesn’t become onerous for the issuer.  Right now, we generally have to trust that stablecoin issuers like Paxos (USDP, BUSD), iFinex Inc. (tether) and Circle (USDC) maintain adequate U.S. dollars or dollar equivalents in reserve to survive a spike in withdrawals by looking at “Trust and Transparency” blog posts or one-page .pdf uploads when we should have some other means in which we could verify their claims. If it’s not clear, this is where a blockchain is supposed to have value.  So policy which edges the stablecoin ecosystem away from where it is now with its “Don’t Verify. Trust.” dogma toward the exact opposite would be a net improvement for the aforementioned “many.” Especially because it is those “many” who can most benefit from stablecoins.  Just ask the Lebanese citizens who are opting to use U.S. dollar stablecoin tether to pay for groceries as their country’s sovereign currency tanks and the economic crisis continues to unfold. Regulation that decreases the likelihood of yet another bank run experience for people is a good thing. And don’t think for a second the plight of the Lebanese person doesn’t at least loosely resemble that of some Americans.  If the U.S. government instead intends to regulate stablecoins harshly in an attempt to introduce its own central bank digital currency (CBDC) with the same or worse transparency and strong-arm people into choosing it from a menu with only one option, then what have we actually achieved here? The attitude that “Uncle Sam knows best” is exactly why our institutions are the way they are now. U.S. stablecoins wouldn’t exist if the current banking infrastructure expanded access to financial services like permissionless stablecoin protocols rather than excluding half the world's population.  Don’t get me wrong, I maintain that stablecoin regulation is good for Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the escape hatch. In a world where the regulators continue to pile on stablecoins and other crypto-related things to the point where they’re rendered toothless, Bitcoin will be there.  See also: Paul Dylan-Ennis – The Rise and Fall of Bitcoin Culture | Opinion  Borderless, censorship-resistant, peer-to-peer money will be open for you then as it is now. Even if payments aren’t your thing and you live in the world of crypto trading, Bitcoin can fill in admirably as the base of trading pairs as it did in the early days of crypto if U.S. dollar stablecoins are regulated out of existence.  Still, although this can be good for Bitcoin, cheering for it by urging on regulation is unsavory and in exceedingly poor form. Freedom of choice is central to the Bitcoin ethos.

42411213,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMCnM,1676469176,4 Reasons Why US Lawmakers Shouldn’t Back Sen. Warren’s Latest Crypto Bill,"Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) confirmed during a Senate committee hearing Tuesday that she will reintroduce the controversial Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act (DAAMLA) with one or more co-sponsors in the near future. It was originally introduced in December and did not go anywhere. It was met with little fanfare and considerable criticism, among other reasons because it was patently unconstitutional.  As the senator’s previous press release explained, that bill sought to mitigate national security risks by “closing loopholes in the existing anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) framework and bring the digital asset ecosystem into greater compliance with the rules that govern the rest of the financial system.” In Tuesday's hearing, Warren reiterated claims, without little evidence, that crypto empowers criminal actors far more than the little guy.  Bill Hughes is senior counsel and director of global regulatory matters at ConsenSys.  The 2023 version of DAAMLA is reportedly revised, but it still falls irreparably short in several material respects. Legislators and their staff should look beyond the national security sales pitch, which is arguably compelling, and give the substance of this bill as much careful scrutiny as the last version received from some corners. Its rather remarkable implications are set forth below.  1. Software developers and users are the new financial institutions  If you desire ground-breakingly expansive compliance regimes, then this is the bill for you. It requires the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) to apply its rules, which currently only apply to financial institutions and money transmitters, to any U.S. person who develops or uses certain foundational crypto software.  Specifically, DAAMLA instructs FinCEN (whether it likes it or not) to treat U.S. developers of crypto software and even people who simply run open-source crypto software as “financial institutions” for purposes of the U.S. anti-money laundering (AML) regime. This includes software that mines or validates blockchain transactions, which is the global technical mechanism that secures blockchains like Ethereum.  In other words, this bill requires U.S. persons publishing and running certain types of software, whether as a business or merely a hobby, to set up an AML program according to standards generally applied to, among other things, banks.  Treating devs and crypto users as “financial institutions,” as that term is defined in FinCEN’s operative statute the Bank Secrecy Act, would also compel them to first get FinCEN’s permission before publishing or using crypto software via a registration regime. It follows that users and devs would be required to collect sensitive personal information from lots of people, namely anyone who uses the code, and to add to the fire hose of suspicious activity reporting from which FinCEN already drinks.  See also: Elizabeth Warren's New Financial Surveillance Bill Is a Disaster for Civil Liberties | Opinion  FinCEN implicitly declined this approach when it released guidance on virtual currencies in 2019. That guidance is still operative. There is precisely zero indication that FinCEN has otherwise identified gaps in its mass collection of financial information.  As you may have suspected, no other free country has thought to go this route.  2. Broad new supervision  Warren’s bill also compels the U.S. Treasury Department, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to spin up new compliance audits of AML programs of financial institutions and software developers alike. Regular, hands-on scrutiny of countless thousands of registrants would be a massive undertaking and that requires resources.  There is no evidence DAAMLA accounts for the additional staff and budget that would be required, other than to say that “such sums as are necessary” will be appropriated. It similarly does not reflect any analysis of how burdensome compliance would be on the public in terms of time, money and manpower, or the extent this type of supervisory regime would kill off small players and serve as a barrier to entry to all but entrenched incumbents.  3. Doing something is important, whether it actually works or not  For all of the major changes DAAMLA would bring, it would not meaningfully fix any crypto money laundering problem. U.S.-based wallet providers, validators and miners as well as other software developers and users are not network gatekeepers that can meaningfully impact nefarious actors exploiting blockchain.  Wallets, validators and miners are built, deployed and operated around the world in almost every conceivable jurisdiction, often far beyond the grasp of U.S. authorities. As a functional matter, the network and its participants to some degree do not care whether the software or network service is American or developed and provided from elsewhere.  If all the U.S. software wallets and nodes vanished tomorrow, the network would not really skip a beat operationally. It would also continue to mature, without considerable U.S. participation or influence.  This all overlooks that these software tools do not “facilitate” any illicit transaction in any common usage of that word. So called “unhosted wallets” facilitate money laundering as much as your Google Chrome browser does. Indeed, Google Docs and Gmail probably do more to “facilitate” sanctioned transactions than unhosted wallets.  See also: Bill Hughes – Money Crypto Versus Tech Crypto | Opinion  Perhaps Google should start an AML program, too?  4. Overlooking the Constitution  DAAMLA is almost assuredly unconstitutional in a number of important respects, particularly in its application to particular regulatory targets. The bill appears to require software developers to register before publishing code – even freely available, open-source code.  Regulating the non-commercial publishing of code, including by compelled registration, is a “prior restraint” problem in light of the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment, which the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly held to apply to programming language.  Further, compulsory AML programs would force software developers to write certain code to ensure the developers can survey and report on users of that code. American jurisprudence’s high bar for compelled speech can be a perilous thing to legislate around. Requiring users of this software to relay or confirm only those transmitted messages that conform to government requirements would quite clearly constitute content-based censorship.  Room for improvement  DAAMLA is just as notable for what it leaves out, namely the one AML tactic that has proven productive to date. Blockchain analytics technology is being broadly used by law enforcement to track illicit flows and pinpoint the crypto exchange that the launderer uses to exit the system.  See also: A 5-Pronged Approach to Sensible Crypto Regulation After FTX | Opinion  Law enforcement is getting better at this but needs more training and resources. Exchanges both in the U.S. and abroad, through which the vast majority of illicit flows pass, should be more responsive to stopping these flows. Both the government and public sector could collaborate better to share information so illicit flows can be identified, stopped and recovered. A bill that supported efforts along these lines would actually produce tangible outcomes.  There is very little on which Sen. Warren and the digital asset space sees eye to eye. Both recognize that illicit finance is an important issue but there is not much agreement on the extent of the problem or how to address it through public policy. It is of little surprise that the crypto ecosystem’s reaction to DAAMLA has been full-throated criticism. Whether lawmakers can agree with that criticism requires them to take positions on the key implications set forth above. And for those who might consider co-sponsoring this bill, it’s important they recognize precisely what they would be promoting.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Bill Hughes,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/02/15/4-reasons-why-us-lawmakers-shouldnt-back-sen-warrens-latest-crypto-bill,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f966742faffea1b658f5a1a9b7160e0e828cf4bf-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The rally came amid a new vote submitted that relates to distributing voting LDO tokens spread over a period of up to four years to decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) contributors. Lido DAO has the highest value locked of all decentralized finance protocols, according to DeFiLlama. A proposal was also submitted on Tuesday by the DAO’s financial unit over whether the DAO should sell or stake the 20,000 ether in its treasury.  Binance USD (BUSD), the third-largest stablecoin by market cap, has roughly returned to its $1 peg after Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao on Tuesday commented on his exchange’s connection to the popular Paxos-issued token. Backed by short-term treasuries and cash-like assets, BUSD rallied to $0.9997 in European morning hours on Wednesday, recovering from a two-year low of $0.9950 hit after the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) on Monday ordered Paxos to stop minting more of the tokens. “BUSD is not issued by Binance,” Zhao said during a Twitter Spaces on Tuesday. “We have an agreement to let them [Paxos] use our brand, but that's not something that we created.”  Soros Fund Management, the investment vehicle of hedge fund billionaire George Soros, appears to have added exposure to some crypto companies before the end of last year, although the nature of the trades isn’t totally clear. According to a 13F filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dated Dec. 31, Soros Fund Management purchased 39.6 million worth of convertible debentures of crypto miner Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA). The fund was also showing ownership of call options and put options on 50,000 shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR). Soros' 13F from three months earlier disclosed only put options on 50,000 shares.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows a decline in bitcoin's annualized rolling three-month basis or the difference between prices in futures and spot markets.  The basis on the CME has pulled back to a 30-day low of 0.6%, while that on Binance sits relatively higher at 3%.  ""The CME basis has fallen more rapidly than offshore futures, suggesting that institutional speculators are more concerned than their offshore peers,"" Arcane's analysts said.  - Omkar Godbole  Trending Posts  Siemens Issues Blockchain Based Euro-Denominated Bond on Polygon Blockchain  Crypto Markets Analysis: CPI Data Shakes Crypto Markets Before Cooler Heads Prevail  Binance and Huobi Freeze $1.4M in Crypto Tied to Harmony Bridge Theft",POSITIVE,BTC | LDO,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | BNB | LDO,"Lyllah Ledesma, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/15/first-mover-americas-the-sandbox-is-up-on-saudi-arabia-partnership-news,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4ca85849593a3df34516647a81f45a741ba094ce-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Modulo is a multistrategy hedge fund founded in 2022 by two former Jane Street traders and one developer, a person familiar with the matter told CoinDesk in December. Jane Street is a New York-based proprietary trading firm where Bankman-Fried worked prior to making it big in the crypto industry. Public filings show Modulo was based in the Bahamas and operated from Albany, the same luxury condominium complex where Bankman-Fried and other employees of FTX and its sister company Alameda resided.  Around the time FTX collapsed, Modulo’s holdings were converted into cash and are stored in an interest-bearing account with JPMorgan, which served as its prime broker, handling its trading in stocks and stock futures, the NYT report said. The fund is looking for FTX to release it from certain legal liabilities in exchange for returning the money, the New York Times said, citing one of the four people. There is no indication that the Modulo founders did anything wrong, according to the report.  Modulo's two founders, Duncan Rheingans-Yoo and Xiaoyun Zhang, known as Lily, recently hired Aitan Goelman, a criminal defense lawyer who is a former director of enforcement for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a previous New York Times report said. Goelman didn't immediately respond to a CoinDesk request for comment.  Court filings have revealedthe U.S. government wants to take control of nearly $700 million of assets it seized in January from Bankman-Fried, according to court filings. But it is not clear why prosecutors have not seized the Modulo funds at JPMorgan, the report said.  The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York declined to comment. JPMorgan and representatives for FTX didn't respond to requests for comment. They all declined to respond to NYT requests for comment, the report said.

The hashrate gained 100 EH/s within around one year, twice as fast as it went from 100 EH/s to 200 EH/s, data from Luxor Technologies shows. “It is a strong testimony of how institutionalized the industry has become,” said Wolfie Zhao, head of research at TheMinerMag.  Starting in late 2021, mining firms took out big loans to build out mining capacity. This hypercharged the development of new mining sites and the hashrate quickly climbed. However, the economics of mining also deteriorated significantly due to the increased competition and, later, the bear market – sending some of the industry’s biggest companies to bankruptcy court.  Read more: Inside Core Scientific’s Prearranged Bankruptcy  In the last few weeks, the economics of mining have improved, along with the price of bitcoin. The hashprice, a measure of mining profitability, bounced back to over $70 per petahash/second (PH/s) from below $60/PH/s at the end of 2022.  With profitability on the horizon, miners – including those with less efficient setups – have plugged back in machines they took down to deal with the market headwinds.  At an electricity cost of 6 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh), “equipment with an efficiency of 50J/TH is now profitable whereas a month ago, equipment with an efficiency of 40J/TH could barely generate any meaningful profit,” Zhao said.  “Legacy commitments” and increased deployment of newer, more efficient and powerful machines account for the growth of the network, wrote analysts from investment bank B. Riley in a note to investors on Jan. 31.  But the turbo-growth of 2022 will not be repeated: The overall deterioration in mining economics will stunt the rate of hashrate growth in the next year, analysts said.  “While it took less than one year for the Bitcoin hashrate to grow from 200 to 300 EH/s, we will likely have to wait considerably longer until it breaks 400 EH/s. I'm confident we will end 2023 at below 350 EH/s, as the poor mining economics of 2022 didn't incentivize new investments,” Jaran Mellerud, analyst at mining services Luxor Technologies, said.  D.A. Davidson analyst Chris Brendler said that, given current bitcoin prices, the network growth is “here to stay” in a Jan. 31 note to investors. That’s due to a recent drop in the price of natural gas, which means lower power prices for miners.

42410853,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggs2I3,1676462400,Arbitrum Surges Ahead as Ethereum’s Layer 2 Landscape Takes Shape,"Ethereum’s layer 2 landscape is finally taking form, and Arbitrum is in the lead.  Arbitrum is currently the fourth-largest blockchain in terms of the total value locked (TVL) into its decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, according to DefiLlama.  Its $1.49 billion TVL is nearly double that of its main competitor, Optimism, which uses similar technology to scale Ethereum yet has a TVL closer to $800 million.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Arbitrum owes much of its recent growth to GMX, a decentralized spot and perpetual exchange that launched in September 2021 and has since grown precipitously. GMX currently accounts for about 30% of Arbitrum’s entire TVL, about $457 million. (GMX is also deployed on the Avalanche blockchain, though its footprint there is around a quarter the size).  Decentralized finance platforms like GMX use smart contracts to allow users to transact without intermediaries, and they collect fees from users as a way to reward liquidity providers and community members. GMX has been so successful in recent months that, during a 24-hour period this past weekend, it earned more in transaction fees than the Ethereum blockchain did during the same period.  Ethereum’s layer 2 landscape  When Ethereum transaction fees skyrocketed last year in response to increased user demand, rollups – separate blockchains that bundle up and “settle” transactions on Ethereum – were viewed as an urgently needed solution to the chain’s growing accessibility problem. Unlike sidechains like Polygon PoS, which also bundle up transactions and settle them on Ethereum, rollups (also called layer 2 platforms) take advantage of Ethereum’s existing security apparatus.  The first big rollup chains to market were Optimism and Arbitrum, both classified as “Optimistic” rollups in reference to the mechanism they use to borrow Ethereum’s security.  Read more: What Are Rollups? ZK Rollups and Optimistic Rollups Explained  Transaction fees on Optimism and Arbitrum currently average around 20 cents and 14 cents, respectively, according to data from Blockworks. In comparison, average transaction fees on Ethereum are over 75 cents, according to yCharts.  Ethereum’s layer 2 ecosystem had a slow start, and the total value locked across layer 2 rollups continues to be an order of magnitude lower than that locked on Ethereum. However, in recent months, layer 2 projects have consistently seen higher combined transaction volumes than Ethereum’s base chain, according to L2beat.  Arbitrum employed a different growth strategy from Optimism, which, in a bid to attract more users, offered its native OP as an incentive for people to use some Optimism-based apps.  Arbitrum does not have a token, meaning it relied on the organic growth of its decentralized finance ecosystem to attract users to its platform. It is possible, though, that Arbitrum’s usage numbers have been inflated somewhat by bots designed to farm the platform’s yet-to-be-announced token. (When crypto protocols announce tokens, they frequently airdrop some of them as a reward to existing users.)  Arbitrum and Optimism remain the largest rollups today, but they will face stiff competition in the coming months from a new cohort of upcoming zkEVMs – a more advanced breed of rollups that uses zero-knowledge cryptography to improve fees and security.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | MINING | ARB,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/02/15/arbitrum-surges-ahead-as-ethereums-layer-2-landscape-takes-shape,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fc7a6b9350d4280f0473574e12c52001e1b9d9e1-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412874,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6fxO,1676461489,Explaining the Disconnect Between Bitcoin and Treasury Yields Post-US Inflation Data,"Risky assets like bitcoin (BTC) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq index unexpectedly put in a positive performance on Tuesday even as U.S. consumer price index (CPI) data revived hawkish Federal Reserve concerns and sent Treasury yields higher.  A rise in bond yields makes borrowing more expensive and typically has traders ditching risky assets in favor of fixed-income securities, as observed in 2022. Yet, while the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield jumped more than 12 basis points to the highest in over a month, bitcoin added nearly 2% on Tuesday, topping $22,000, and Nasdaq ended the day 0.7% higher.  U.S. CPI data showed January inflation slowed slightly from the previous month, but the cooling trend moderated. The data also lifted the two-year yield to a two-month high of 4.64% and prompted traders to ramp up bets of a quarter-point (25 basis point) Fed rate increase in June while assuming similar moves in March and May.  The central bank raised rates by 25 basis points last month, having delivered a half-point rate increase in December and four 75 basis points hikes earlier in the 2022. The speedy tightening cycle roiled risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, last year.  ""Risk assets are following implied volatility, which sold off heavily following the CPI release,"" QCP Capital's market insights team told CoinDesk. ""[We] guess the thinking is as long as the Fed doesn't panic and go back to 50 basis points, we are in for a slow ride, which equities can stomach, especially if its a period of strong growth with high prices which will still benefit equities through higher earnings.""  Implied volatility refers to the options market's forecast for price turbulence over a specific period and is often equated with uncertainty.  Data from Amberdata show bitcoin's seven-day implied volatility dropped sharply to an annualized 40% from 50% following the CPI release, paving the way for the cryptocurrency to track technology stocks higher.  Moreover, while inflation remains stubbornly high, the economy remains resilient, providing risk assets a reason to rally. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon on Tuesday said the prospect of a softer landing for U.S. economy has improved. Soft landing means a cyclical downturn in economic activity that stops just short of an outright recession, measured by consecutive quarterly contractions in growth rate.  According to Singapore-based QCP, bitcoin's resilience may be fleeting, especially if ""it starts looking like the Fed will raise the median dot plot at the March meeting."" In December, the median dot projected a year-end 2023 rate of 5.125%.  Noelle Acheson, the author of the popular Crypto is Macro Now newsletter, said bitcoin's resilience stems from declining broader market volatility and its positive impact on liquidity conditions.  ""Among risk assets, crypto is the purest of the liquidity plays,"" Acheson told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. ""Liquidity is not just dependent on lower rates, it is also influenced by factors such as volatility (lower volatility tends to reduce collateral requirements, and both the VIX and the MOVE bond volatility index are heading down) and the oil price (a lower spend on energy releases more liquidity).""  Unlike stocks, cryptocurrencies don't have to worry about earnings downgrades, nor will they get hit by a surge of bond issuance and the resulting rise in yields, Acheson said.  Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader from crypto asset management firm Blofin, said market-maker actions lifted bitcoin higher after the CPI data.  Market makers are individuals or entities with a contractual obligation to maintain a healthy level of liquidity on an exchange. They are usually on the opposite side of the investors' trades and keep a delta-neutral (direction-neutral) book that requires active management.  According to Ardern, investors had bought BTC put options, or bearish bets, in the lead-up to the CPI release, which means market makers sold puts and sold bitcoin in the spot/futures market to hedge against the risk of price slide. So, after prices began to rise post-CPI, market makers had to buy back the bitcoin sold.  ""That further drove prices higher,"" Ardern told CoinDesk.  Bitcoin was trading above $22,200 at press time.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/15/explaining-the-disconnect-between-bitcoin-and-treasury-yields-post-us-inflation-data,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0b5ce873e9ef1da7645773193cc37959ea19a802-4800x3188.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

While crypto has not yet made significant inroads into the bloc’s banks, the ECB said they should treat the assets as risky and limit holdings right away.  “The BCBS standard is not yet legally binding pending its transposition in the European Union,” said a newsletter from the ECB, which is responsible for directly supervising the largest banks in the currency bloc. “However, should banks wish to engage in this market, they are expected to comply with the standard and take it into account in their business and capital planning.”  The BCBS recently proposed to assign the highest possible risk weight of 1,250% to unbacked digital assets such as bitcoin (BTC), meaning banks have to issue capital equal to their crypto holdings. They would also be limited to holding crypto in amounts not exceeding 1% of their core capital known as Tier 1.

42412868,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6fte,1676457202,Coinbase: Ether Selling Pressure Should Be Fairly Limited Around the Shanghai Fork Upgrade,"The decision by crypto exchange Kraken to shut its staking business as part of a settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has added to the uncertainty around ether (ETH) supply dynamics ahead of the Ethereum blockchain’s next upgrade, the Shanghai Fork, Coinbase (COIN) said in a research report Tuesday.  Coinbase notes that Kraken’s staking pool on Ethereum makes up about 7% of total staked ether supply; however, not all of these assets will have come from U.S. retail clients.  “Unstaking by Kraken could result in a minimum of [350,000] up to a maximum of 1.145 [million] additional ETH that could potentially circulate in the market when the staked ETH withdrawals are enabled in the Shanghai Fork,” wrote David Duong, head of institutional research. The Shanghai Fork will allow ether that has been staked, and is currently locked, to be withdrawn for the first time.  It’s unclear if freeing this additional ether will be a catalyst for selling pressure, the report said, noting that in December, investors were worried that the upgrade “represented an important event risk to the downside,” but that view shifted as crypto market sentiment improved.  While the regulatory environment has clouded the outlook, selling pressure should be fairly limited because there are mitigating factors and “self-correcting mechanisms” that should help control the flow of ether on the open market, the note said.  Ether performance around the fork will be more dependent on what “risk does at the time withdrawals are enabled.” If the macro environment deteriorates and equity markets are weak in March, investors may decide to unstake and sell ether to reduce risk, while institutions may not step in as aggressively as buyers, the note added.  Conversely, if risk sentiment at the time is positive, Coinbase says it would expect demand to more than offset the amount of ether being unlocked on the open market.

The stakeholders signed the recovery plan a day before the exchange was set to go into liquidation, according to documents submitted to Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). Creditors were notified earlier today through a circular.  The exchange is expected to resume trading next week, a person familiar with the situation said.  The Brisbane-based exchange was hit hard by the collapse of FTX as it held 33 million Australian dollars on the defunct platform founded by Sam Bankman-Fried.  This is the first successful restructuring of a Australian cryptocurrency exchange, according to Michael Bacina, digital asset specialist and partner at Piper Alderman. ""Digital assets face challenging legal issues, and it took the hard work of knowledgeable specialists to get here. The deal is a testament to the goodwill seen throughout the blockchain community in Australia,” Bacina added.  In December, Digital Surge passed into voluntary administration, a process in which the management hands over control to licensed insolvency practitioners who independently assess its financial situation. Melbourne-based investment firm KordaMentha was appointed as administrators.  In late January 2023, creditors approved a long-term recovery plan for Digital Surge that still needed the company and the administrators to sign on the dotted line within 15 business days. The documents were signed before the deadline ended on Wednesday.  Under Australian law, the approval of a judge is not required, as the vote of the creditors is what decides the outcome.  As previously reported, according to a deed of company arrangement (DoCA), the exchange will receive a loan of 1.25 million Australian dollars from an associated business, Digico, to support the business. The company has now received the loan from the Directors.  According to the DoCA, customers with under $250 will be repaid in full and others will receive at least 45% of their balance immediately and the remaining 55% over five years from profits of the company.  “This is a great result for all stakeholders and provides the best possible return to customers and creditors given the circumstances,"" said David Johnstone, KordaMentha administrator.

Neither Laser Digital nor Infinity disclosed details about the size of the investment or valuation.  Infinity is a hybrid lending and borrowing platform that combines blockchain-based, permissionless settlements with traditional finance (TradFi) processes and risk management. Founded by a Morgan Stanley alum, the protocol focuses on offering fixed and floating interest rate markets and crypto yield curve to institutional investors.  “Infinity’s groundwork paves the way for institutional flows on-chain, new levels of rates and risk innovation,” Olivier Dang, head of ventures at Laser, said in a statement.  The investment highlights a growing trend of merging crypto-native DeFi infrastructure and TradFi solutions to enable the tokenization of assets such as credit and creating blockchain-based markets for institutional investors.  DeFi protocol Clearpool is set to launch its institutional-grade platform in the next months, while Maple Finance recently unveiled a tax receivables lending pool. Onyx, American banking giant JPMorgan’s hybrid protocol, settled over $300 billion of intraday repurchase (repo) deals as of November.

The investment follows Infinity’s $4.2 million seed funding round, with trading heavyweights such as CMS, GSR and Susquehanna among the investors.

Dubbed “Valentine,” the upgrade will make enhancements to cross-chain functionality for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications building on the network. It was proposed earlier in February and voted favorably by network validators, as CoinDesk reported.  The upgrade is said to bring enhanced cryptographic features to Cardano while improving cross-chain decentralized application (dapp) development on Plutus – the smart contract platform of the Cardano blockchain.  “Interoperability is key for blockchain growth. As more dapps are built on Cardano, it is essential that they are not siloed to just one ecosystem, enabling users to interact with different blockchains and access a wider range of services,” a Cardano developer and code maintainer said in a tweet.  Cross-chain bridges are software applications that enable transactions to occur between various blockchains.  Such a feature on Cardano would allow developers to build applications that connect Cardano with other blockchains, which would in turn give users access to other blockchains to interact easily with financial services offered by Cardano dapps.  Dapps rely on smart contracts instead of middlemen to offer financial services, such as lending and borrowing, to users, who often use that dapp’s token or are rewarded in those tokens.  This, in turn, would likely improve the utility of Cardano’s native ADA token. As such, Wednesday’s upgrade preceded buying pressure on the token, with the price up 8% in the past 24 hours, outperforming bitcoin and ether.  The locked value of tokens on Cardano-based dapps has increased over 100% since the start of January to over $110 million, suggesting demand.",POSITIVE,ADA,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/02/15/cardano-gets-valentine-upgrade-heres-how-it-benefits-ada-token,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0e7013de11f7d7e110edbc0e35d8457c629dc7d3-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The plan is as part of the overall reorganization plan for Celsius' retail platform and mining business and has the support of the official committee of unsecured creditors (UCC).  At the center of the plan is an in-principle agreement with NovaWulf Digital Management (“NovaWulf”), a digital asset investment firm, making it the plan sponsor.  The Debtors chose NovaWulf as it ""provides the best method to distribute the Debtors’ liquid crypto assets and maximize the value of the Debtors’ illiquid assets through a new company run by experienced asset managers,"" the filing said.  The plan is the product of the Debtors’ court-approved sales process which Celsius Network lawyers had outlined in January 2023. They had said that the bankrupt crypto lender is planning to reinvent itself as a new, publicly traded “recovery corporation” in order to exit the bankruptcy process.  The ""comprehensive"" sale process involved Debtors’ advisors contacting over 130 parties and executing non-disclosure agreements with 40 potential bidders. This was whittled down to six bids for the retail platform, and three bids for the mining operation.  The next step will be to finalize a binding agreement to designate NovaWulf as the successful bidder.  According to the plan, NovaWulf will make a direct cash contribution of $45 million to $55 million to NewCo, a term used a describe a corporate spin-off before it is assigned a final name.  NewCo will be a regulatory-compliant public, reporting company 100% owned by Earn creditors, all of whom will receive a significant distribution of liquid crypto, with a ""convenience class"" of creditors receiving 70% recovery of their funds. No Celsius founder will be involved in NewCo and the majority of the NewCo board will be appointed by the UCC.  The plan specifically reserves $50 million for NewCo's mining operations, among other mining-related specifics.  U.S. bankruptcy law normally gives a company four months in which it can exclusively set out how it will wind affairs up. A bid by Celsius to further extend that period has been opposed by creditors and the U.S. government.

Airdrops are the unsolicited distribution of a cryptocurrency token or coin, usually for free, to numerous wallet addresses and are generally used as a tactic to gain users.  BLUR tokens were airdropped to users of the Blur marketplace, with the airdrop amount depending on the total activity, network volume, and transactions made by each user on the platform.  This meant some users received as many as 128,000 BLUR tokens, tweets show. Blockchain tool Etherscan further shows users received as little as 25 BLUR to hundreds of thousands of BLUR.  Blockchain data shows there are over 33,000 unique wallet holders of blur as of Wednesday morning, with a majority of these initially receiving the airdrop before likely transferring the tokens out to other wallets.  Some traders sold the tokens en masse after receiving the airdrop. The tokens were initially listed at $1 on crypto exchange Coinbase, but fell to as low as 48 cents late on Tuesday. However, Asian hours on Wednesday saw buying pressure and the tokens rose to 72 cents as of writing time.

CoinDesk data shows that the price of DOGE has risen 5.4% over the past 24 hours.  Musk replaced Parag Agrawal as CEO of Twitter when his acquisition deal for the social networking platform closed on Oct. 27. While the two reportedly had a cordial relationship when they first met, after Musk became Twitter's largest shareholder their relationship reportedly soured as 2022 dragged on. Musk has unfollowed Agrawal on Twitter, while the former CEO still follows Musk.  In December, it was reported that Musk had begun looking for a new CEO of Twitter after losing an online poll on the topic.  “I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job! After that, I will just run the software & servers teams,” he said.  Floki up nearly 50%  Meanwhile, floki, which takes its name from Musk's Shiba Inu dog, is up 41% in the last 24 hours according to CoinGecko data.  In January, Floki's price rallied almost 100% after the Floki Inu DAO, the group behind the coin, passed a governance resolution to do a $100 million token burn.  The logic behind burning tokens is that it decreases supply, which subsequently adds value to each token provided the level of demand remains the same. This is sort of like a stock buy-back in the crypto world.  Will DOGE bring a dog day to the markets?  This isn’t the first time DOGE has spiked on a Musk-related tweet. In late January a report from the Financial Times that said Twitter is designing a system to permit crypto payments, sent the meme coin soaring.  A December 2022 report from blockchain analytics firm Santiment cautioned that, historically, outsized gains in DOGE and other meme coins like shiba inu (SHIB) have been the first sign of a market-wide sell-off.  During the last three months, markets have begun to recover from the depths of the FTX-induced crypto winter. By mid-January, CoinDesk reported that bitcoin had erased its entire FTX-related decline. The market recovery has also kicked off an altcoin season with many of these coins posting double or triple-digit gains.  Bitcoin has posted a 34% gain in the last three months, while SHIB is up 40%, BONK up a staggering 533%, and floki up 242%.  Despite the other canine coins barking at the moon, during this time period — including today's surge — DOGE is actually down 2% suggesting, if Santiment's thesis holds true, that we aren't yet at the point of a market-wide sell-off.

Last year DBS said it planned to expand DDEx into retail trading by the end of 2022, but canceled those plans in April 2022 citing Singapore's regulatory environment.  In a February 2022 interview with CoinDesk, Lionel Lim, the CEO of DDEx, said the exchange’s full-year trading volume was about $819 million for 2021, a fraction of what institution-focused LMAX Digital or Hong Kong-based institutional exchange OSL would do.  DBS is also considering expanding DDEx into Hong Kong when authorities in the city finalize its new crypto framework.  “At the appropriate time, DBS will apply for the necessary licenses in Hong Kong to avail our digital asset solutions to the market,” Sebastian Paredes, CEO of DBS Bank’s Hong Kong operations, said in a statement.

42410845,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggs1oI,1676422800,South Korea’s Crypto Firms Will Have to Self-Regulate Under New Guidance,"South Korean securities firms and token issuers now have some clarity on how security tokens are defined under new guidance published Monday.  South Korea's Financial Services Commission has defined security tokens as tokens that are digitized using distributed ledger technology, thus bringing the country in line with other jurisdictions in the wider Asia region.  Under this guidance, the onus will first fall on firms to regulate themselves.  “South Korea's approach of tying the scope of security token offerings back to the definition of securities is broadly aligned with other regulators such as Singapore and Hong Kong,” said Angela Ang, senior policy adviser at blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs and a former regulator at the Monetary Authority of Singapore.  The regulatory clarity “should encourage digital asset innovation in South Korea's capital markets,” Ang said.  Before the guidance was released, traditional securities firms had been cautious about entering the market.  “The basic stance that the securities law may apply to tokens was similar [to the U.S.],” said Mooni Kim, foreign attorney at law firm Kim & Chang. “The question of ‘How?’ always followed.”  Players in traditional finance that already hold securities licenses are already responding. One is Shinhan Investment and Securities, one of the country’s largest securities companies, which has invited other companies to join an alliance to inform investors of the benefits of token securities and set standards and best practices for issuing and trading.  “Securities firms seem to have some hope for it, but I don’t think it will impact our business that much,” said a crypto exchange executive who spoke on condition of anonymity to preserve his relationship with local regulators. He said that he did not see the guidance as a sign that the regulators were encouraging the crypto industry.  “Securities are already available on the securities market,” he said. “Perhaps accurately defining the asset types should come first.”  He said that he was waiting on the outcome of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit again Ripple. He doesn’t want South Korea to rush ahead of the rest of the world when it came to regulating.  “It’s good for investors,” this executive said of the guidance, because the “Korea Securities Depository will control the total amount of issued assets and keep an eye on token issuers.”  Last year, South Korean gaming company Wemade allegedly gave a false disclosure on the number of Wemix tokens it issued, leading to major crypto exchanges to delist Wemix.  Self-assessment  Legislators will next reshape key existing laws to cover security tokens. Regulators will propose amendments to the Capital Markets Act and the Electronic Securities Act, which will be put forward to the National Assembly in the first half of this year.  Following the collapse of the Terra system's UST stablecoin last year, South Korea’s regulators have worked towards tougher protections for consumers and drafting a regulatory framework for the crypto industry, which will eventually take shape in the Digital Asset Basic Act.  Still, firms will be taking the first step by self-regulating. The guidance requires interested parties, such as issuers and brokers, to determine whether or not a token is a security.  Crypto players will have to go through their own classification and assess their related tokens to see if they have to put themselves forward to be regulated under the securities regime, Kim said.  Firms that don’t hold securities-related licenses will have to go through the process of obtaining licenses which can take one to two years, depending on the licenses and the business model of the company.  Ang expects to see growing pains as businesses and regulators reach agreement on what is and what is not a security.  Still, “the FSC provides detailed guidance to help inform that decision and will likely assess each determination on a case-by-case basis,” Ang said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TOKEN SALE,Lavender Au,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/02/15/south-koreas-crypto-firms-will-have-to-self-regulate-under-new-guidance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/72a805260a95ad6f2e2f96389cad9035aae5209f-6000x4196.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42388065,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR48Zf,1676422431,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Holds Steady on CPI Data. Are Investors Undecided?,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Crypto markets are undecided on CPI. Watch out for AI meme tokens.  Insights: Are Ordinals driving up the price of bitcoin? Probably not. But here's one important metric to watch.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,051 +22.5 ▲ 2.2% Bitcoin (BTC) $22,149 +382.1 ▲ 1.8% Ethereum (ETH) $1,550 +44.8 ▲ 3.0% S&P 500  4,136.13 −1.2 ▼ 0.0% Gold  $1,866 +13.6 ▲ 0.7% Nikkei 225  27,602.77 +175.5 ▲ 0.6% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  Bitcoin Ticks Up Slightly; Ether Outperforms  Bitcoin is opening the East Asia trading day relatively flat at 1.8%, or $22,149. Ether has begun the day outperforming bitcoin, trading at $1,550, up 3%.  A broad theme over the last year has been the correlation between the crypto market, the consumer price index, and equities. Tuesday’s CPI report, which showed January’s CPI slowing at a lesser rate than expected, shook the market, but bitcoin kept with its upwards trajectory.  Speaking on CoinDesk TV, Martin Leinweber, a digital asset product strategist at MarketVector Indexes, said that the crypto market seems a little bit “undecided” right now.  “It seems that the market focuses more on the trends and not at the level,” he said. “Maybe the fact that they’ve changed the methodology to calculate the CPI going forward is also a role.”  Leinweber said that this is leading to a shift in market focus from beta trading to looking for alpha in digital assets.  “There’s a renewed interest in thematic investing,” he said, pointing to the significant growth in tokens like optimism, layer 2s and liquid staking derivatives like LIDO.  Decentralized finance (DeFi) “could decouple when you compare it with bitcoin,” he said. “There’s a greater demand for infrastructure applications.”  DeFi needs stablecoins, and the headlines surrounding U.S. regulators attacking stablecoins are frightening investors.  “My hope we have some clarification going forwards because investors will have to have a reliable stablecoin because we need that in the ecosystem,” he said.  Leinweber says we need to watch out for meme coins. As the broader tech market is caught up in the GPT-3 fueled frenzy over artificial intelligence, a number of AI-related tokens have popped up.  Leinweber cautions that these are just this cycle’s meme coins. “There’s no AI in blockchain!” he said.  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Cardano ADA +7.4% Smart Contract Platform Polygon MATIC +5.6% Smart Contract Platform Gala GALA +3.5% Entertainment  Biggest Losers  There are no losers in CoinDesk 20 today.  Insights  Bitcoin’s UTXOs Are Nearing a Record High; Here’s Why It Matters  Activity on the Bitcoin network is hitting a record high because the market has been receptive to the new collections minted via Ordinals, a type of non-fungible token (NFT) stored on Bitcoin.  There’s another metric that’s important, too: unspent transaction output (UTXO). And the UTXO count of bitcoin (BTC) is ticking upwards, set to challenge its all-time peak of 84.6 million from November 2022 – when there was a flurry of on-chain activity as traders tried to escape the wreckage of FTX's collapse.  UTXO refers to the individual units of bitcoin, called satoshis, or sats, that are locked in transactions on the blockchain.  When a transaction occurs, bitcoins are sent from one address to another and the remaining amount is returned to the sender in the form of a UTXO.  These UTXOs can then be used as inputs for future transactions, essentially proving that the sender has the necessary funds to make the payment.  Now, this spike in UTXO could be explained by an increase in small retail interactions with bitcoin. It also shows that more individuals – as opposed to whales or large investors – are currently active on-chain.  ""It seems like the overall trading size of the bitcoins has decreased and investors are carefully watching how the market direction would turn out with the UTXO value bands with less than 0.01 BTC are the main reason for the significant increase in the UTXO counts,“ CryptoQuant contributing analyst Dan Lim wrote in a note to CoinDesk. “It's good progress as there are market participants tapping into the market.""  UTXOs have steadily appreciated over the last two years. They experienced a brief dip during the coldest depths of the 2022 FTX-induced, end-of-year crypto winter but resumed their climb as bitcoin rallied through January.  UTXOs also tell us that despite a new, large cohort of people interacting with bitcoin thanks to Ordinals, there’s also a large group of whales HODLing. As CoinDesk previously reported, the age of UTXOs older than five years has increased by 17% in the past six months.  “Overall, the growth of the Bitcoin UTXO counts is a good thing because more exposure of bitcoins can create mass adoption in the long run,"" Lim said.  But the question is, what does this mean for the price of bitcoin? On one hand, a collision between a large group of stalwart HODLers and a new, growing group of retail users is, in theory, bullish for the price of bitcoin. Some, however, aren’t so sure.  Tony Ling, co-founder of data portal NFTGo, and a partner at Bizantine Capital, doesn’t think the demand from Ordinals is high enough yet to drive up the price of bitcoin, although it's causing an uptick in activity on-chain.  “There’s no mature marketplace on the Bitcoin network, so I have doubts about the real conversion and purchase demand,” he told CoinDesk in a note.  According to Ling, bitcoin's recent price rise has been fueled by an influx of USDT into bitcoin, not by increased pressure on the Bitcoin network due to Ordinals.  Ling is still bullish about the price of bitcoin and expects it to reach around $30,000-$35,000 – but any attempt at testing all-time highs is not going to be until the second half of 2024.
