This initiative allows users on supported exchanges to send and receive cryptocurrencies using Mastercard Crypto Credential aliases, streamlining the transaction process. Mastercard Crypto Credential Pilot As announced on Wednesday, the platform extends its services to users in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, France, Guatemala, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, and Uruguay, enabling them to conduct cross-border and domestic transfers across multiple currencies and blockchains. This expansion is further boosted by including Foxbit, a crypto wallet provider, and Lulubit, through its integration with Lirium, into the Mastercard Crypto Credential pilot ecosystem, reportedly broadening its reach to a larger consumer base. Related Reading: Research Firm Projects Ethereum Explosion To $15,000 With ETF Inflows The Mastercard Crypto Credential acts as a verification mechanism for interactions between consumers and businesses on blockchain networks. It is designed to simplify transactions by exchanging metadata, eliminating the need for users to know the recipient’s supported assets and chains, thus increasing trust and security in each transaction. Moreover, Mastercard Crypto Credential complies with regulatory requirements, including the Travel Rule, which promotes transparency and prevents illegal activities in cross-border transactions. Notably, this framework paves the way for additional use cases in the future, such as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), ticketing, and other payment solutions based on market demand and compliance standards. For users, the process begins with verifying the user against Mastercard Crypto Credential standards and issuing an alias to conduct transactions across all supported exchanges. When a transfer is initiated, the platform validates the recipient’s alias and verifies that the recipient’s wallet supports the specific digital asset and associated blockchain. If the recipient’s wallet does not support the asset or blockchain, the sender is immediately notified, protecting all parties from potential loss of funds. The announcement further reads: This milestone marks the first real-world application of the Mastercard Crypto Credential vision, which was unveiled at Consensus in 2023. The live Mastercard Crypto Credential P2P transactions represent the potential to further expand and support the domestic and cross-border remittance market. Access To Secure Crypto Transactions? Walter Pimenta, Executive Vice President of Product and Engineering for Latin America and the Caribbean at Mastercard, expressed enthusiasm for the project, stating that the continued investment in technology, standards, and partnerships aims to deliver safe, simple, and secure payments. Partners, including Bit2Me, Foxbit, Lirium, and Mercado Bitcoin, have also expressed their commitment to innovation and the development of crypto solutions that drive alternative payment options and increase user experience.

The so-called FIT21 crypto bill is now a ""consensus product"" of the House and can't be ignored, he said.  Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) vowed the crypto industry won't have long to wait to get U.S. regulations, now that the U.S. House of Representatives has shown the way.  ""We will have crypto law within the next year, and I can say that with certainty,"" McHenry, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee told an audience Wednesday at CoinDesk's Consensus 2024. ""Crypto policy is inevitable, and crypto law is inevitable.""  McHenry, who has been wrangling the crypto legislation in the House, argued that the outcome is assured by the massive level of bipartisan backing last week for his Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) – with more than a third of House Democrats showing up to vote yes, despite pushback from the White House. He said the momentum will carry into the next congressional session in 2025, if it has to, and will lift the market-structure bill and the long-awaited legislation to regulate stablecoin issuers.  ""We basically have a consensus product out of the House of Representatives,"" McHenry said. ""That's a huge thing that we have to take advantage of and leverage it into law.""  Read More: U.S. House Approves Crypto FIT21 Bill With Wave of Democratic Support  Meanwhile, the prominent House lawmaker, who is retiring from Congress at the end of the year, said he'll keep trying to find a way to keep the legislation alive this year. While granting that ""the Senate's a more complicated beast,"" he said he'll be trying to find some way to get the bill over the finish line and to President Joe Biden's desk before he leaves Congress.  When asked whether he had a specific must-pass bill to tie it to, he said, ""anything and everything – that's what I'm looking for.""  Earlier in the day at Consensus, a senior member of his Republican caucus, Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), suggested that crypto legislation has its best chance of success toward the end of this year, when Congress is transitioning out of this session and toward the next – known as the lame-duck session.  McHenry's 2025 promise may be tempered somewhat by the fact that he'd said something similar at the same Consensus event a year earlier, but he explained Wednesday that he had no way of predicting the chaos of the House Republicans' leadership battles that left him as the stand-in speaker for a short time and effectively stalled legislative progress.  While U.S. lawmakers and crypto executives were meeting at Consensus in Austin, Texas, to speak about current events in crypto – often criticizing the approach of SEC Chair Gary Gensler – the regulator posted a fresh alert on Wednesday warning of crypto scams.  ""Fraudsters often use innovations and new technologies to perpetrate investment scams, and this has been the case with crypto asset securities-related investments,"" the agency said in its newest alert.",POSITIVE,없음,REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/05/29/us-lawmaker-at-center-of-crypto-negotiation-predicts-digital-assets-law-by-next-year,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/639d2a2f29205d65c94de4a0a2189e1ff9396704-8303x4671.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Speaking at CoinDesk’s annual Consensus conference in Austin, Brian Nelson – the Treasury’s Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence – addressed the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network’s (FinCEN’s) 2023 proposal to classify mixers as a “primary money laundering concern” and require virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to report any crypto transactions that involved mixing to the agency.  FinCEN’s proposal – along with an increasing number of enforcement actions by the U.S. Department of Justice against mixing services including Tornado Cash and Samourai Wallet – have been seen by many in the industry as evidence of a coming attempt to ban crypto mixing in the U.S. entirely, which the Treasury is firmly denying.  “At the end of the day, this [proposal] is not a ban on mixers,” Nelson said. “This is a proposed rule designed to drive transparency.”  Nelson said he’s sympathetic to crypto users’ desires for financial privacy, but suggested that the industry and Treasury should work together to find ways to enhance privacy without enabling terrorist financing.  “From our perspective, we believe that there is a difference between obfuscation and anonymity enhancing services that support privacy – we of course totally recognize that, in the context of public blockchains…that there would be a desire to have a certain degree of privacy,” Nelson said. “In that spirit, we want to work closely with industry to identify and collaborate on tools that can enhance privacy.”  Nelson said that the majority of mixers he’s seeing are not actually created to enhance privacy, but are made to skirt anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) reporting requirements, thus making them “very attractive” to bad actors, including North Korea.  “It’s not that everybody needs to know who you’re transacting with,” Nelson said – just that people and VASPs alike need to know they’re not “unwittingly” funding Hamas or North Korea’s weapons program.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | REGULATION,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/05/29/us-treasury-isnt-trying-to-ban-crypto-mixers-top-official-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fe650d2fc9ba3a3806900fb191d94fdc0264a4e0-7250x4078.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

28648419,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=610365,1717020033,How High Can Bitcoin Go Before A Top? Analyst Chimes In,"An analyst has explained how the Bitcoin rally could still have room to run before hitting a top based on the data of this indicator. Bitcoin Macro Oscillator Isn’t At Historical Top Zone Yet In a new post on X, analyst Willy Woo has discussed the recent trend developing in the Bitcoin Macro Oscillator (BMO). This indicator combines four different metrics to provide an oscillating value around the zero mark. The indicators in question are the market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) ratio, Cumulative Value-Days Destroyed (CVDD) ratio, and Sharpe ratio. Related Reading: Is Mt. Gox A Worry For Bitcoin? Crypto Analyst Weighs In The chart below shows how the oscillator based on these metrics has fluctuated in value over the past few Bitcoin cycles. From the graph, it’s visible that tops in the cryptocurrency’s price have historically coincided with the metric reaching relatively high levels. More particularly, the 2013 and 2021 tops occurred when the indicator breached the 1.8 level, while the 2017 peak occurred when the oscillator hit 2.4. So far, in the current rally, the oscillator has achieved a peak value of 1.2. This high coincided with the asset’s all-time high (ATH) price, which continues to be the top of the run thus far. When considering the historical precedent, though, this value doesn’t seem to be high enough for the top to have been cyclical. As the coin’s price has consolidated since this high, the oscillator has cooled off, now hitting just 0.69. Thus, the asset has gained more distance from the zone where tops have occurred in the past. “This 2.5 months of consolidation under bullish demand has been very good for Bitcoin; it means the price has more room to run before topping out,” notes Woo. The analyst suggests that BTC could now have 2 to 3 levels of the BMO to climb before reaching the macro top. Woo has also pointed out a potential positive sign brewing for Bitcoin regarding its net capital flows. Below is a chart showing this metric’s trend over the last few years. As displayed in the graph, net capital flows into Bitcoin were quite high during the surge toward the price ATH, but money stopped flowing in as the asset fell into sideways movement. Related Reading: Ethereum Deposits At 4-Month High: Whales Preparing For Selloff? During May, though, the net flows have finally reversed the trend, as they have been on the rise once more. This fresh demand can naturally be bullish for the cryptocurrency’s value. BTC Price Bitcoin surged above the $70,500 level earlier, but the coin has since slumped back down, trading around $67,800.

In late April, his firm, Consensys, decided to preemptively sue the U.S. securities watchdog after receiving what’s known as a Wells notice – or an indication that the agency is building a case against a firm.  On the Mainstage at Consensus 2024 on Wednesday, the longtime crypto advocate gave a sense of what Consensys is trying to get out of its lawsuit filed “in the great state of Texas.” Namely: regulatory clarity, the preservation of free markets in crypto and a resolution that open source developers will not be targeted.  “What we're trying to achieve is the freedom to innovate,” Lubin said on stage. “We have been doing our best to thread the needle between offering access to applications and needing to be a regulated financial institution. We're pretty sure we got it right and continue to get it right,” which is why the SEC’s recent, call it interest, in Ethereum is so worrying.  See also: ‘It Can Be Said With Confidence the SEC Is Investigating Ethereum’: Consensys’ Bill Hughes Talks Crypto Law  Lubin suggested that the SEC has begun to target the biggest players in Ethereum like decentralized exchange Uniswap, the nonprofit Ethereum Foundation and major development studio Consensys precisely because their efforts challenge the potential authority and “vested interests” of regulators and legislators.  “Ethereum represents an existential threat to the weight of life of those who would prefer to perpetuate the system and be a top down control,” Lubin said, adding later that crypto is already changing “the structure of society.”  “We need some sort of deliverance from top down command and control because it's not working as well as it needs to,” he added.  At the same time, however, Lubin said that crypto has crossed “the chasm” into American politics, which has become an increasingly popular talking point among speakers. For instance, CEO Tom Farley of Bullish (which owns CoinDesk) and New York Stock Exchange President Lynn Martin agreed on stage that in 10 year’s time it’s unlikely crypto remains a partisan issue.

But he stressed the importance of talking to “all parties that are holding power currently,” even if many in crypto are “more interested in moving beyond the current political constructs” through decentralized tech.  “Most of the people who are empowered by the technology realize that decentralization is consistent with American principles like free market capitalism and democracy,” Lubin said.",POSITIVE,없음,ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/05/29/crypto-is-a-core-american-issue-consensys-joe-lubin-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d7f5c8783a6d7db29734a6488ca59ef9761a8741-5459x3071.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

U.S. regulatory environment will improve in the next couple years regardless of the election outcome, Tom Farley, the CEO of Bullish and Martin's predecessor at NYSE, predicted.  AUSTIN, TX — The New York Stock Exchange would consider offering cryptocurrency trading if the regulatory status of such an expansion by the stock market giant was clearer, the company's president said.  ""If there was clear regulatory guidance [in the U.S.], it would be an opportunity to look at,"" Lynn Martin said Wednesday during a panel discussion at Consensus 2024 in Austin, Texas.  U.S-listed spot bitcoin {{BTC}} exchange-traded funds (ETF) amassing $58 billion of assets is ""a strong sign"" that there's demand for regulated crypto products, she added.  While traditional financial markets and digital assets are increasingly getting more intertwined with more traditional financial heavyweights offering crypto products, the lack of regulatory clarity is still weighing on the industry slowing innovation, Martin and Tom Farley, CEO of crypto exchange Bullish, discussed during the panel discussion. (Bullish is the parent company of CoinDesk. Farley previously had Martin's job at NYSE.)  Read more: NYSE Plans Bitcoin Options, Bringing Another TradFi Giant Into Crypto  ""The fact that you've seen $58 billion or so come to the ETFs has been a strong sign that the market is looking for regulation in traditional structures,"" Martin said. ""So, hopefully, the [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission] saw the inflows and said, 'Hey, this makes a lot of sense,' considering bitcoin ETFs have been a tremendous success.""  NYSE's U.S.-based rival, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), a giant in regulated crypto futures trading, is planning to launch spot crypto trading to clients, the Financial Times reported earlier this month.  Farley highlighted the sudden change of heart towards crypto in U.S. politics, including the ousting of the anti-crypto chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), the passage of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) bill in the House, and Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump doubling down supporting crypto in a rapid chain of events.  ""Five years of evolution happened in five minutes,"" he said. ""I'm really optimistic about what it means in this country. I think, just like in Europe, just like in Hong Kong, you're going to have regulators codified, 'Hey, what's your reasonable digital assets industry look like.'""  ""You're gonna see progression in 2024 and 2025, irrespective of whether or not it's Trump or Biden or Michelle Obama [will be president],"" he added.  Martin said she continues to be optimistic about using blockchain technology to make financial processes more efficient and transparent, especially for less liquid assets such as municipal bonds.  However, Farley said traditional, real-world assets won't migrate to digital asset rails en masse given regulators' distrust towards public blockchain plumbing. ""Regulators want to get their power-hungry, sticky little fingers on everything,"" he said. ""How do you get your fingers on the Solana? How do you get your fingers onto something that's decentralized?""  Hence, regulators would likely push TradFi firms towards developing private blockchains instead of using the existing blockchains for settlement, he said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/05/29/nyse-would-consider-crypto-trading-if-regulatory-picture-were-clearer-president-says-at-consensus-2024,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b34011cfaa53d38c5532f32d0f94249c60ffc8f3-5134x2888.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, beyond the price rally, SHIB is shining in other places, and one of those is the open interest. This metric has seen a significant increase, with potential implications for the SHIB price going forward. Shiba Inu Open Interest Sees 85% Surge The Shiba Inu open interest in up over 85% in the past day as the price has gone on a recovery trend. Open interest tracks the futures or options contract for a particular asset, given a total of how much money is invested in that asset’s derivatives at a time. This means that the amount invested in Shiba Inu derivatives over the last day has seen a significant jump. Related Reading: Ethereum Spot ETFs: Report Shows Grayscale Could Keep ETH Price Down With $110M Daily Outflows The 85% figure is taken from an average of two increases in the Shiba Inu open interest across the Binance and ByBit exchanges. According to data from Coinglass, the SHIB open interest in Binance rose more than 60% in the last day. In the same vein, the Shiba Inu open interest is up more than 111% on the Bybit exchange in the last day. So on average, the open interest for the meme coin is up a whopping 85% in 24 hours. Dollar figures also show the significance of this jump and just how much crypto investors are moving into Shiba Inu. The current open interest on the Binance exchange is $136.79 million, which means whatever $82 million flowed into SHIB derivatives product in one day. On the Bybit exchange, the rise is similar, currently showing a total of $96.16 million in open interest. At a rate of 117.81%, it means that around $50 million flowed into SHIB derivatives on the exchange. Combined, the Shiba Inu open interest if up around $135 million in one day. SHIB Price Still Seeing Upside The drastic rise in the Shiba Inu open interest is undoubtedly a positive development for the SHIB price. This rise has now sent the open interest toward its previous all-time high of March 5, 2024. If history is anything to go by, if the open interest hits a new all-time high, then the meme coin could be looking at a new yearly peak toward $0.00004. Related Reading: $2.9 Billion In Mt. Gox Bitcoin On The Move For The First Time In 5 Years, Where Is It Headed? Amid the surge in open interest, the SHIB price also rose around 16% at the same time.

Interestingly, the surge saw Shiba Inu briefly overtake Cardano and claim the 10th spot on the list of largest cryptocurrencies by market cap.

The first version of the network, built on the Arbitrum Nitro tech stack, will start in June to test cross-chain settlements in a publicly transparent manner. The full-fledged Gravity Mainnet with native staking and restaking aims to go live in the second quarter of 2025. The reason for creating Gravity, said the Galaxe team, is that the platform's user base has significantly grown over the past three years, now counting 20 million users and 100 million monthly transactions. This required a more efficient and scalable solution to manage cross-chain interactions between 34 blockchains that Galxe supports.  ""Existing solutions fell short in supporting the required complexity and scale, prompting Galxe to develop Gravity,"" the team said in a statement.  Gravity will be a proof-of-stake blockchain, simultaneously supporting restaking via EigenLayer and Babylon to leverage the Ethereum network's security. The chain also gets a new native token G, with the existing token GAL's contract migration already approved by the platform's decentralized autonomous organization.  The network will use Reth as execution layer and consensus algorithm Jolteon (AptosBFT) for near-instant transaction finality and high throughput, the team said. It will also be compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

42408134,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga9vNi,1717014618,Is Crypto on the Cusp of a Bull or Bear Market? Using Consensus 2024 as a Barometer,"The question on everyone’s mind at Consensus 2024 seems to be: How the hell should we be describing the current market sentiment? Are we in a bull market? A bear market? On the cusp of another bull market? Teetering again on the edge of collapse?  Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates. This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Since the launch of bitcoin exchange-traded funds earlier this year, bitcoin has regained and even surpassed the all-time high it set during the heady days of the 2021 bull market. But for weeks and weeks and weeks it seems like, at best, the biggest crypto has been trading sideways.  By and large, there have been many positive developments for crypto in recent months. The European Union, after passing MiCA last year, is beginning to see traction in its domestic crypto market while other global hubs like Hong Kong, United Arab Emirates and countries across the Caribbean have also been advancing meaningful legislation  And perhaps more importantly, it finally seems like regulatory gridlock in the U.S. is beginning to ease up. The House recently passed the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) last week, marking the furthest a crypto-specific bill has ever gone in legislatively. Meanwhile, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission did a U-turn on Ether ETFs.  It would seem like conditions are in place for a breakout, but so far it remains unclear exactly what crypto’s future is.  “Call me cautiously optimistic,” Adam Roberts of the institutional MPC wallet told CoinDesk in an interview on the showroom floor. “The ETH ETF approval is sign of change, but it’s not enough to re-catalyze things.”  “Ask me in two days and I’ll have a better answer,” Roberts added. “Based on how fast the coffee went – that’s a good indicator.”  It was a point echoed by Roberts’ colleague Steve Horvath, who joked about using Consensus 2024 as a barometer for market sentiment.  “Based on the crowd – no bear, no bull,” Horvath said.  Micha Benoliel, co-founder and CEO of Nodle, is a little more optimistic about the recent regulatory shifts, noting that the SEC’s heavy handed approach to crypto oversight has driven a lot of firms abroad and made it difficult to run a business domestically.  See also: Trader Buys 2M Dogecoin Call Options as Meme Coin Market Heats Up  If all goes well, “that alone should create a new bull market since the U.S. remains the largest crypto market in the world,” Benoliel said.  Amanda Wick, founder and CEO of the Association for Women in Crypto and a former Department of Justice prosecutor, is likewise optimistic this year, having looked around the conference floor and seeing signs of a maturing industry.  “Consensus this year compared to last year felt like night and day,"" said Wick. ""The maturation was evident in the conversations, the speakers, the sponsors and the intentional inclusion of groups that are working to make the industry more diverse,” she added, noting the outreach done this year to include diversity groups like LGBTQ+ advocates at Web Q. “The industry’s best chance at sustaining a bull run is through maturation and increased integrity, and Consensus this year clearly reflects a positive move in that direction,” she concluded.  Indeed, it may not be exactly clear whether crypto is on the cusp of another bull or bear market – but with any luck it has learned to avoid what brought it down last time.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/05/29/is-crypto-on-the-cusp-of-a-bull-or-bear-market-using-consensus-2024-as-a-barometer,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/604b2ca384178d1bb8397b262b5d78ca853356ec-4281x2408.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In this cycle, the analyst said meme coins are resilient and that there is an unconventional altcoin rotation, which means the landscape is changing. Meme Coins On Fire: Traders Raking Millions From PEPE, WIF While there are doubts about the sustainability of meme coins, considering they mostly lack utility and are speculative, top tokens, especially PEPE, outperform Bitcoin and Ethereum. Recently, PEPE soared to register fresh all-time highs, printing new crypto millionaires. Lookonchain data shows that after purchasing 6.1 million WIF for $5,879 in December 2023, one trader now holds $23.7 million worth of the coin. With this return, the trader posted an impressive ROI of 1,197x. The trader is not the only one. Another recently sold all their WIF holdings for $2 million worth of SOL. Lookonchain data notes that the trader has also profited from BONK and Boden. Platforms are also realizing the importance of tokens like BONK or HONK. Since they are speculative and without complex roadmaps, they attract new investors keen on exploring crypto and the multiple platforms in the space. Related Reading: Time To Stack Stellar (XLM)?

The Treasury determined that NFT platforms ""lack appropriate controls"" to combat money laundering and sanctions evasion.  The U.S. Treasury Department said non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are ""highly susceptible to use in fraud and scams and are subject to theft,"" in a new risk assessment about illicit finance, its first into NFTs as a means of carrying out fraud and other crime.  ""The report determines that illicit actors can use NFTs to launder proceeds from predicate crimes, often in combination with other methods to obfuscate the illicit source of proceeds of crime,"" the Treasury said on Wednesday.  The Treasury also determined that NFT platforms ""lack appropriate controls"" to combat money laundering and sanctions evasion. Therefore it recommends further application of regulations to NFTs and the platforms they are traded on.  A U.S. government study into NFTs in March concluded that no specific legislation was required to deal with concerns around copyright and trademark infringement.

42408131,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga9vH6,1717006730,TradFi Rushes In: Goldman Sachs Digital Assets Lead Mathew McDermott on the Institutional Embrace of Tokenization,"Approval of bitcoin ETFs was a ""big psychological turning point,"" reigniting retail trading interest in crypto and bringing in new types of institutions.  Tokenization is a growing trend due to the sheer benefits of ""digitizing the lifecycle"" of asset issuance by improving firms' operating efficiency and increasing liquidity.  Crypto has the ability to transform parts of the financial system to operate in more efficiently.  AUSTIN, TX — Goldman Sachs, the 150-year-old investment bank, is getting deeper into crypto, according to the firm's global head of digital assets, Mathew McDermott. The executive, a 19-year veteran of the bank, helped found its digital asset desk in 2021 and has since led efforts to introduce a suite of products and services including liquidity in cash-settled derivatives, options and futures crypto trading.  McDermott, who sits on the boards of Coin Metrics and HQLAx and advises firms like One River Digital and Elwood Technologies, discussed a number of topics at Consensus 2024, including the viability of other crypto-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) after ether {{ETH}}, where the biggest opportunities remain for firms like Goldman and the rising popularity of tokenization.  ETFs and beyond  ""The bitcoin ETF obviously has been an astonishing success,"" McDermott said on stage at the Money Reimagined summit. This has not just recatalyzed retail trading interest in crypto broadly, but has also started to bring in new types of institutions making new types of plays. It was a ""big psychological turning point"" for the industry.  Will that translate into the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approving a wider swathe of crypto-based products? The securities watchdog recently approved applications from exchanges like Cboe, NYSE Arca and Nasdaq that want to list ETH ETFs, but may take months to pass the S-1 filings from wannabe issuers like Ark Invest, Bitwise, BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale, among others.  ""This is a natural progression that ETH will hopefully be approved to be a fully tradable ETF,"" McDermott said. Whether that ""opens the door for everybody else"" like Solana {{SOL}}. Perhaps, but perhaps not – due to the established dominance of the big two cryptos.  See also: 3 Questions About the SEC's Abrupt ETH ETF Approval  ""From my vantage point, our clients typically just focus on bitcoin and Ethereum – they're the two products that have tradable futures on the CME. So that's why you can see a positive read [on ETH ETFs]. In terms of others, I think we could be positive, but I think it's too early to say.""  Tokenization  Goldman was undoubtedly early to the tokenization trend, though has yet to fully embrace using open blockchains. McDermott said the firm's decision to use private, permissioned chains beginning in 2021 had more to do with the uncertain legal environment than any sort of ""strong ideological position.""  ""For us, seeing what our clients want to do then becomes 'how can you service our clients'. It's been important to have our own platform to move in a slightly more expeditious way,"" he said. Because clients like wealth managers and institutional investors' needs can change, the firm has ""options"" on where it ultimately ""settles.""  Ultimately, McDermott says, he sees tokenization as a growing trend due to the sheer benefits of ""digitizing the lifecycle"" of asset issuance, which not only improves firms' operating efficiency but also liquidity by potentially bringing in a wider group of investors.  See also: The Benefits of Assets Tokenization  ""If you can actually create a product that you can fractionalize and offer up to a much broader universe of investors that not only broadens the distribution channel but also concentrates more secondary liquidity – that is very powerful,"" he said.  Where to next?  While McDermott said Goldman is already well on the way to proving the ""commercial viability"" of banks using blockchains, a lot of the products today are relatively ""vanilla."" Nevertheless, if the tokenization of staid asset classes like money market funds continues, that means an additional $4.7 trillion in collateral that can be used to create derivatives and repos. ""That's hugely powerful,"" he said.  ""As you get clarity on the regulations, you get more people coming in on the sell side and start showing the viability of the market on-chain,"" he said. ""You can then start to build out and tap into these other asset classes where the value proposition probably is great,"" like real estate and green debt issuance.  Might crypto ever replace banks?  ""Institutions like ours actually see the potential in how it can transform where parts of the financial system can operate in a much more efficient way.""

We'll also be doing a live recording of The Protocol podcast on Thursday.)  As things were warming up around town on Tuesday, I made the rounds – attending a summit on how to fund Bitcoin Core developers, an event hosted by the DePIN project Akash with crypto OG Eric Vorhees and a happy-hour party hosted by the Sui developer Mysten Labs, Axelar developer Interop Labs and Big Brain Holdings, an early-stage crypto investment firm. I also took a spin through the show floor, and took some photos. See below.  ALSO:  Implications of ETH ETF approvals (or almost-approvals).  RIP Dogecoin doggy.  Trump pledges to commute Ross Ulbricht's sentence with time served.  Top picks from the past week's Protocol Village column: Ledger, Taiko, ENS, Dfinity, Horizon.  This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Also please check out our weekly The Protocol podcast.  Network news  The Grayscale Ethereum Trust's discount to its net asset value (NAV) has narrowed with the regulatory progress on Ethereum exchange-traded fund proposals. (Coin Metrics)  ETH ETF IMPLICATIONS - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved key regulatory filings for proposed exchange traded funds (ETFs) linked to the price of the Ethereum blockchain's native cryptocurrency, ether (ETH) – after months of speculation that regulators would likely deny the instruments. While most Ethereum supporters likely applauded the step, since the ETH token's price rallied, the developer shop Consensys couldn't resist the opportunity to tweet that ""this seemingly last-minute approval is yet another example of the SEC's troublesome ad hoc approach to digital assets."" Consensys, which is suing the agency, argued that the approval might mean Ethereum is no longer under the threat of being declared a security, which would trigger strict regulations. The approval isn't final, because the SEC only approved 19b-4 filings for the proposals, as opposed to the S-1 registration statements that would be needed before the ETFs can start trading; the green light for those could still take months. (This distinction caused a minor controversy on the prediction-betting platform Polymarket, since some bettors who had put money on a denial argued that they hadn't officially lost.) What's clear from the past week is that the SEC won't allow the ETF issuers to stake their ETH tokens – essentially depriving holders of the instrument to capture the extra yield. From a blockchain security perspective, that might mean that there's less circulating ETH supply available to put to work in Ethereum's proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. ""The inability for issuers to stake ETH, could have potential downstream implications for the supply dynamics of ETH, the health of Ethereum’s consensus layer and the staking ecosystem as a whole,"" according to a report Tuesday from the analysis firm Coin Metrics. Another question might be how well any new ETF buyers would actually understand how the smart-contracts blockchain functions.  DOGE DIRGE: Kabosu, the Shiba Inu dog whose viral meme picture inspired the creation of dogecoin, died last week at 17. DOGE’s success later birthed a whole cohort of dog-themed tokens such as shiba inu (SHIB) and floki (FLOKI), which have since cumulatively become one of the industry’s biggest sectors. The Solana blockchain has dogwifhat (WIF). Tesla billionaire and X owner Elon Musk, whose tweets about DOGE have sent the token's price soaring in the past, posted that ""OG Doge has ascended to heaven."" Within minutes, the price surged as much as 5% to a session high.  In a postscript to The Protocol's writeup last week on the disclosures that two top Ethereum Foundation researchers had accepted paid advisory deals with the restaking platform EigenLayer, the foundation's executive director, Aya Miyaguchi, wrote on X that ""we have been working on a formal policy"" to address potential conflicts of interest. ""It is clear that relying on culture and individual judgment has not been sufficient,"" she wrote.  Former U.S. President Donald Trump, running for reelection, pledged to commute Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht’s life sentence to time served if he wins in November.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin proposed the inaugural block. ""Taiko deployed Based Contestable Rollup (BCR), a type of based rollup that combines based sequencing and a contestation mechanism with multi-proofs,"" according to a blog post.  3. Ethereum Name Service Labs, the company behind the ENS domain name protocol, proposed Tuesday to go through a complete architectural redesign that would turn the network into alayer-2 blockchain. The proposal, dubbed “ENSv2,” will overhaul the project's registry system as part of the transformation into a layer 2, which is an auxiliary network that provides cheaper transaction fees that can then be settled to the base blockchain, Ethereum.  4. Dfinity Foundation, a major contributor to Internet Computer (ICP), announced that its ""EVM RPC canister,"" described as ""a new API that allows ICP smart contracts to read and write data on different chains,"" is now live. According to the team: ""The EVM RPC is another major milestone in the development of Dfinity's Chain Fusion framework. It enables Internet Computer smart contracts to interoperate directly with all major blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, other EVMs, and soon, Solana, without having to rely on any intermediary.""  5. Horizen Labs, a primary developer behind the Horizen blockchain, is launching ""zkVerify, a dedicated zero-knowledge proof verification network designed for settlement optimization, to address the largest expense that zkRollups and zkApps currently face which limit scalability and efficiency,"" according to the team: ""ZkVerify offloads computationally intensive proof verification, enabling blockchains to focus on core functions.

28640490,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=610397,1717005600,"Solana Remains Institutional Investors’ Favorite, YTD Flows Ramp Up To $29 Milion","Solana (SOL) is rapidly gaining the attention of institutional investors, who are increasingly showing a strong interest in this crypto token. This trend underscores the possibility that Solana could be the next in line to launch its Spot ETF, a development that could significantly impact the crypto token’s price. Solana Investment Funds Record Year-To-Date Inflows Of $29 Million According to CoinShares’ latest weekly report, Solana investment products currently boast a year-to-date (YTD) net inflows of $29 million. Last week, these funds saw net inflows of $8 million. Meanwhile, these Solana funds have recorded net inflows of $19 million this month alone. Related Reading: Market Expert Says XRP Price Reaching $1,000 Is Inevitable, Here’s Why This development highlights the significant demand for Solana among institutional investors. It also strengthens the case for SOL as the next crypto asset to have its own Spot ETF following the approval of the Spot Ethereum ETFs. Fund issuers are bound to weigh the popularity of other crypto tokens (besides Bitcoin and Ethereum) when deciding which Crypto ETF to apply for next. Solana is undoubtedly the clear favorite, as it has recorded the most YTD flows among other crypto investment funds, excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum. The demand for Solana among these institutional investors is also evident, given how notable institutions like asset management firm Pantera Capital actively bidded and purchased some of the discounted SOL tokens, which formed part of FTX’s bankruptcy estate. Brian Kelly, founder of digital assets investment firm BKCM, had recently predicted that a Solana Spot ETF was likely next in line, considering that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana are the ‘Big 3’ for this cycle. As such, it is only logical that a SOL ETF comes next since Bitcoin and Ethereum Spot ETFs have been approved. Asset manager Franklin Templeton also backed the Solana narrative, predicting that the crypto token would soon become the third-largest crypto token by market cap behind Bitcoin and Ethereum. Meanwhile, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart also weighed on the possibility of a Solana ETF being next, stating that this fund will see more demand than other digital assets besides Bitcoin and Ethereum. Digital Asset Products Record Third Consecutive Week Of Inflows Last week was a good one for crypto asset investment products in general. These investment products recorded net inflows for the third consecutive week, with $1.05 billion flowing into these funds. Most of these inflows went into Bitcoin investment products, which recorded net inflows of $1.01 billion last week. Related Reading: Ethereum Spot ETFs: Report Shows Grayscale Could Keep ETH Price Down With $110M Daily Outflows Meanwhile, Ethereum recorded $36 million in net inflows last week. This figure represents the highest inflow that Ethereum investment products have seen since March. CoinShares noted that this was likely an early reaction to the approval of the Spot Ethereum ETFs in the United States. Besides Solana, which saw a net inflow of $8 million, Litecoin, XRP, and Chainlink were the other altcoins that recorded notable flows, with $2.8 million, $400,000, and $600,000 flowing into these crypto assets, respectively.

42408132,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga9vKP,1717005410,U.S. House's Emmer Says Best Hope for Crypto Legislation Is Year-End Session,"One of the top members of the U.S. House of Representatives predicted that the best remaining chance for major crypto legislation this year is in a tight window at the end of the congressional session.  Republican Emmer noted the major recent support from Democrats in Congress for crypto measures, but he suggested the U.S. Senate probably has significant work to do.  Despite the crypto industry's high-profile recent wins in Congress, major legislation faces a massive practical roadblock in the Senate, U.S. Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) acknowledged Wednesday, saying that chamber will want its own say in a big crypto bill, leaving little time in the waning congressional session.  If there's a chance for the House-approved Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), Emmer said said at CoinDesk's Consensus 2024 event in Austin, Texas, it's ""probably more likely during the lame-duck"" – the session of Congress that occurs between the election and the transition to the new session at the start of the year. It's a period in which must-move legislation is often targeted with unrelated add-on bills that can jump into law through fast-moving negotiations.  In the normal legislative course, Emmer, who is top leader in the House as the majority whip for the Republican caucus, pointed out that FIT21 – which got hefty support in the House – is now on-deck in the Senate. If lawmakers there actually pick it up or engage in serious work on a similar bill, that effort would need another run-through in the House.  ""They're going to want to change it, which means it comes back to the House,"" Emmer said, though he noted the major emerging support from Democrats on this and other crypto matters.  On FIT21, the first comprehensive digital assets legislation to win approval in one of the chambers of Congress, 71 Democrats joined in the yes vote despite opposition from President Joe Biden, including former Speaker of the House Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).  Similarly, a separate effort to overturn a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accounting policy, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121), drew a hefty surge of Democrats when it passed the House and Senate, including from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) Biden threatened to veto that resolution.  Emmer said there is ""a ton of goodwill under the surface"" for such crypto issues.  He argued events have overtaken the ""anti-crypto"" Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who he said has an outsized influence over the White House.  Emmer also argued that crypto-critical SEC Chair Gary Gensler is ""on his way out"" and losing favor in the administration.  Still, he warned, ""I'd be very careful about trusting a cornered animal.""

The surprise approval and passage of FIT21 in the House indicate how crypto has become an election issue.  Ark will not make money from its bitcoin ETF.  AUSTIN, TX — ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood said crypto is now a U.S. election issue, which is why key documents for the proposed ether exchange-traded funds (ETF) were approved suddenly and unexpectedly.  ""The read was it was not going to be approved. It was absolutely not going to be approved,"" Wood said on stage at Consensus 2024 in an interview with Peter McCormack, host of the What Bitcoin Did podcast. ""If it were to have been approved the regular way, we would have been getting questions from the SEC. No one was getting questions from the SEC beforehand.""  Wood, who is also the firm's chief investment officer, said sentiment evolved around the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) in the House. The act passed last week with support from both sides of the aisle, making it clear that this could be an election-year issue.  ""The other thing that happened was former President Trump had become much more cozy with bitcoin and crypto generally. That week, he said he would accept campaign donations in crypto,"" which got attention from the administration, Wood said.  Wood also said that while a solana ETF could be approved, meme coin-focused funds are unlikely because wirehouses – the large brokerage firms and investment advisory companies – would not accept more than ""the majors.""  Bitcoin as a public good  Wood also said ARK's position is that bitcoin {{BTC}} is a public good, and the Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF that was approved in January with a fee of 0.21% would not make money.  ""We should make [the ETF] as accessible as possible to as many people as possible, so keep the fee very low.""  She also announced that ARK will allocate a percentage of its private fund revenues to support Bitcoin developers, ensuring they receive consistent support regardless of the ETF's profitability.  Bitcoin vs. Ethereum  Wood is well known for her bullish sentiment on bitcoin, predicting that the BTC price could reach $1.5 million by 2030 and calling it a ""financial super highway.""  Although ether {{ETH}} is having its own moment in the sun thanks to the progress in approving the ether ETFs, Wood didn't hold back in her stance on bitcoin when asked if she would rather hold bitcoin or ether.  ""Bitcoin, hands down. No question about it. It is a global monetary system. It is a technology, and it is a new asset class. Those are three big ideas in one, and nothing else in the crypto world is competing with it.""",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/05/29/cathie-wood-says-ether-etf-filings-were-approved-because-crypto-is-an-election-issue,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b8ecca269d6e54f7c5ca165c080ca55ab09dee66-6443x3624.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Mainstream media figures began launching Solana-based memecoins and seemingly showing interest in cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Is Solana Preparing For Liftoff Or Meltdown? Analysts Forecast SOL’s Future The latest star to join the celebrity token frenzy is Australian rapper Iggy Azalea, who saw a controversial launch similar to Caitlyn Jenner’s JENNER token. Who Is Solana? On Monday, Azalea surprised the crypto community by showing interest in cryptocurrencies. The rapper and model posted on X asking, “Who is Solana? I don’t know that bitch.” The post has gathered over 1.8 million views and caused controversy in different communities. “Stan Twitter” interpreted the post as a drag to American R&B singer SZA, which caused many fans to attack Azalea. However, the rapper quickly clarified the issue, replying, “Girl, I’m talking about crypto.” After that, Azalea found her introduction to the crypto community overshadowed by the allegations of her involvement with alleged scammer Sahil Arora. As reported by NewsBTC, Arora was allegedly responsible for the launch of several celebrity and influencer tokens, which he ultimately rugged. Rapper Rich The Kid and Olympian Caitlyn Jenner called him out for scamming them and taking advantage of their followers. Both celebrities continued their crypto journey, promoting their tokens and engaging with community members. Following the scam allegations, Arora seemingly has continued to take advantage of crypto investors. Azalea is accusing the alleged serial scammer of “using her image” as the rapper distances herself from his practices. In The Fastlane From Music To Crypto Azalea explained that Arora and her team had a conversation regarding crypto, but her recently launched token was unrelated to him. Allegedly, Arora had fabricated fake screenshots and used the rapper’s name to raise over $380,000 in a presale for a token named IGGY. As an X user reported, Arora claimed to be working with the Australian rapper on Telegram. He stated that his next “mega launch” would happen in the next 12-24 hours. After raising 2.246 Solana (SOL), the alleged scammer told investors they would get “automating WL to all further launches.” Additionally, investors would receive a “10% SOL airdrop rationally” from Arora’s profits on each launch and an “airdrop of $iggy when we hit $10m market cap.” However, Azalea launched a different Solana-based token called MOTHER on Tuesday. The token references the LGTBQ+ culture term that got popularized in recent years in online stan culture. Azalea’s token was launched only a few hours after Arora’s IGGY token, which confused investors. After being asked, the rapper explained that she launched her Solana-based token to stop Arora from taking advantage of her name: I never had a date to, it was something I had interest in hence the convo with my ppl. He made a weird presale yesterday and said I was making a coin with him today so I decided to drop one so he couldn’t use me for his weird scam. If I have a coin of my own figured his would die. It’s that simple. The community continued questioning her links to Arora after posting an Instagram story with a man looking like him. However, it was later revealed that the individual was Azalea’s brother, Mathias Kelly. MOTHER Beats IGGY According to Solana Floor, MOTHER reached a market cap of $50 million at its peak. The token soared by 63,000% in the following hours, going from $0.00004968 to $0.03179. In the last 16 hours, the token has amassed a trading volume of $126.8 million. At writing time, MOTHER is trading at $0.01634, representing a 21,000% surge from its launch price. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Eyes a Strong Comeback: Will the Rally Ignite a Surge? In comparison, Arora’s IGGY token saw its price soar to $0.009288 after launch before plummeting below the $0.00020 range.

28636664,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=610433,1716998455,"Bullish Breakout: WIF Starts New Rally Above 100-Day Moving Average, What Next?","The recent upward movement has led the price of WIF to continue its rally above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). This movement comes after it fails to break below the $1.03 support level. With a current market capitalization of $3.9 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of over $1.5 billion, WIF has been dominating the meme world alongside other meme coins like PEPE and DOGE since the start of this recent move. As of the time of writing, the price of WIF was up by 21%, trading around $3.97 above the 100-day moving average in the last 24 hours. WIF On The 4-hour Chart From the 4-hour timeframe chart, it can observed that the price of WIF is actively trading above the 100-day moving average, suggesting that the WIF is on a bullish trend and could continue to move upward. Also, looking at the 4-hour MACD indicator, it can be observed that the MACD histograms are trending above the MACD zero line with good momentum. The MACD line and the MACD signal line are also seen moving above the MACD zero line with a good spread from each other. Given the significance of this MACD pattern, it is possible that WIF’s price will continue to rise and the market is still overwhelmingly positive. On the 1-day time frame, WIF is actively bullish as the price has previously dropped two bullish candlesticks leading to its continuous upward movement today. Furthermore, the 1-Day MACD indicator is giving a bullish sign as the MACD histograms are seen trending above the MACD zero line with good momentum and both the MACD line and the MACD signal line have crossed above the zero line with a good spread between them. From the MACD formation, it can be suggested that WIF’s price might move upward even further. Future Actions Currently, there are two resistance levels of $4.34 and $4.86 ahead of price. Should the price continue to move upward and break above the $4.34 level, it might move further to test the $4.86 resistance level. Also, if it breaks this level, it might trigger a rally to create a new high. However, if the price fails to break through at any of these resistance levels, it might start a downward correction toward the $2.25 support level. A break below this level might cause a deeper correction to test the $1.78 support level.

42408160,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaA70W,1716997573,How Gunnar Lovelace Is Trying to ‘Unf*ck’ the World,"There is a rumor going around Consensus 2024 that JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who reportedly had a recent religious experience on the substance, will be passing out ayahuasca while attending the conference in Austin, Texas.  That is obviously not true. And, Gunnar Lovelace, one of the minds behind the successful organic e-commerce retailer Thrive Markets, should know. He’s primarily the person behind “the rumor.”  The actual Dimon (a known crypto skeptic) likely won’t be in attendance this year (his loss). ButLovelace has arranged for several impersonators to walk around the convention center grounds and … repent for his sins.  Buckle up, because the backstory is about to get pretty weird. The full (fictional) story goes as so: Lovelace, who grew up on a hippie commune, introduced ayahuasca to Dimon, who had a spiritual awakening after getting slapped in the face with a dildo by a shaman. He is now looking for public penance.  To that end, Lovelace is paying multiple Dimon impersonators to wrestle anthropomorphized versions of meme coins and be paraded around Consensus by a dominatrix. The whole series of stunts is estimated to cost Agent Lovelace, as he prefers to be called, $25,000, including budget for labor, costumes and smoke bombs.  “There's a very particular flavor of anti-establishment ‘F you’ degeneracy in the cryptocurrency community that is a hotbed for what we're trying to do. There's really a lot of alignment there,” Lovelace said. He noted in particular the support UNFK has gotten from the Solana community and foundation, which has given them technical guidance for the on-chain, Web3 aspect of the project.  ""Corporate brands are extremely vulnerable to pressure. Memes are an extremely powerful way to harness humor to force them to change in ways that are deeply impactful,"" UNFK co-founder Jared Krause said. ""We are excited to be a community-led project in the Solana ecosystem that gamifies humor in ways that have never been before.""  The meme coin matchups (which are being announced via Telegram here) are all part of an elaborate marketing effort timed ahead of the official launch of Lovelace’s latest effort, United for Kindness, a.k.a. UNFK (pronounced unf*cked), a kind of crowdsourcing application for civil disobedience.  As described on its website: “UNFK is a secret society to prank the world's largest corrupt corporations.”  “Our goal is to inspire millions of people to celebrate their power together, using comedy and pranks in a gamified ecosystem, online and offline that pressures large consumer brands that are profiting on lies and destruction,” Lovelace told CoinDesk in an interview.  The way UNFK intends to go about this isn’t just by staging what are essentially performance art mockeries starring fake Fortune 500 chief executives at various events, but by gamifying social action and collaboration. Next month, in mid-June, the team plans to release an app that has been under development for the better part of a year, which will function as a sort of central nervous system for Lovelace and his team’s grandest social experiments.  UNFK the app, which blends aspects of Web2, Web3 and IRL, will feature an early version of what they’re calling the “Dong Game,” where users are prompted to throw dildos at corporate lawyers outside of big banks and the like. In true crypto fashion, users will be rewarded points as they play (which could one day be redeemed for tokens, though likely not in the U.S.).  Though unlike many blockchain-based games, UNFK fully intends to maintain a presence in meatspace. For instance, for every 50,000 dildos “flung” in the Dong Game, Lovelace has promised to deliver a dumpster truck full of dildos to JPMorgan’s corporate headquarters. Other even more ambitious efforts are also reportedly in the works.  See also: Robert Alice Made NFT History, Now He's Writing About It  “We’re stronger and better by embracing the cryptocurrency community and inviting them in to be the first members of a mass market movement that gamifies engagement,” Lovelace said. “If we succeed at inviting people in and building real community, we're going to be more successful long term.""  The team has also partnered with Amplifier to offer $50,000 in rewards to artists creating parody advertisements calling out harmful corporate products and practices. Guest curators include luminaries like actors Daryl Hannah and Nat Kelley, environmentalists like StarHawk and Lori Ann Burd as well as activists like Charles X Michael and Noah Ssempijja.  Good money gone bad?  Serial entrepreneur Gunnar Lovelace has very humble beginnings. Both of his parents were political activists who were forced to flee dictatorships of their prospective countries – his mom from Argentina and father from Spain, Gunnar said. Although close to both, he described them as “free love libertarian hippies, who were swept up in the wild sex, drugs and rock and roll of the 60s.”  Lovelace, who says he is a distant relative of Ada Lovelace, largely considered to be the world’s first computer programmer (and inspiration for aspects of Cardano), says he grew up in poor, dire circumstances on a commune, where he suffered degrees of trauma and abuse. His mom and stepfather took him to his first ayahuasca at just 17.  “I always knew I wanted to make money,” Lovelace said, adding that he believed it was one of the few ways he could raise himself and his family out of the “out there” circumstances of his upbringing. He attended the University of California, Santa Cruz and dropped out in 1999 to found his first company during the initial dot com boom.  “I saw it as a really direct way of doing good in the world,” Lovelace, who described himself as hardcore capitalist, said. Like many, Lovelace said that we need to shift from the obscene accumulation of wealth that profits on destruction of our planet and making humans toxic. ""If we don't do that we will hand our future children a very toxic and dirty world ruled by corrupt mega corporations.""  That was essentially the driving force behind Thrive Market, which he co-founded in 2013 and has since grown to be one of the largest online retailers of organic food of its kind. As well as Good Money, which had a decidedly less successful fate.  Good Money started off as a blockchain-based app in early 2018, but quickly pivoted into what Lovelace called “a conscious banking solution” during the depths of that year’s crypto winter. The idea was to bridge the worlds of credit unions and fintech together, and create a banking product to better distribute ownership.  Although the platform found early traction and began to scale, a confluence of factors including middleware deals gone awry, a co-founder committing theft and Lovelace’s own self-described toxic management style eventually forced the team to wind down and return some investor funds after four years, which was outlined in a recent Medium post titled “Brutally humbling lessons from Good Money.”  ""[W]hen you have built a career defying people and society who told you no or that’s impossible, you start to believe your own kool-aid,"" he wrote.  After about a year of soul searching following the closure of Good Money, Lovelace came up with the idea for UNFK. While there is no direct link between Good Money and UNFK, Lovelace clarified, many of the two projects’ core team members are the same.  See also: The Burning Question Behind NFTs  “It was so clear that there was still the group of us – the most creative, talented folks that were at Good Money have all come in. In terms of the core team, there's six of us that were a part of the core creative side there that were also involved in earlier projects together,” Lovelace said. He says he’s learned a lot from the failure of Good Money, including minimizing the expectations of success.  “It's an art experiment,” he said when asked how Lovelace expects to make money. “We don’t think it will generate a lot of economic activity. Our goal is to inspire millions of people to celebrate their power together.”  UNFK the world  Julia Landry, who leads UX and product design at UNF and is primarily responsible for building the app, has described the key design principle as “absurdity and humor and ridiculousness.” She is one of the transplants who came over from Good Money to join the 30+ person team at UNFK, to see if it could achieve its goals of pranking the world’s worst capitalists into submission.  “I will say it's one of the most unique experiences of my career,” Agent Landry said. “I am just hoping for a better word for a better world for my kids, as so many parents are. If we're setting the stage to upgrade capitalism from negative to positive externalities, then we've tried everything right? And now it's time to just like let loose and go out and just fling dongs for the kids.”  UPDATE: Adds context about Solana and a quote from Jared Krause, co-founder.

42408173,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaA6jz,1716996518,The U.S. Response to Binance Exec Tigran Gambaryan's Detention Is Shameful,"In late February of this year, two Binance employees were detained by Nigerian officials without notice or a public announcement of charges. In the weeks that followed, Nigerian prosecutors charged the two with money laundering and tax offenses that are entirely divorced from the personal conduct of either man. One of those Binance employees, Tigran Gambaryan, was, in fact, the company’s lead law enforcement liaison – a former IRS criminal investigator and global educator on the use of blockchain technology for identifying and combatting precisely the kind of offenses that he is now unjustly facing in a Nigerian court.  Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.  Andrew C. Adams is a partner in the New York office of Steptoe & Johnson LLP, and a member of the firm’s blockchain and cryptocurrency team. He is a former Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General for DOJ’s National Security Division.  Official response from the United States, diplomatic or otherwise, has been lacking, at least in any public forum. Diplomatic and official responses present a complex problem for U.S. officials, of course, who must consider multiple valences of partnership even with a country that otherwise appears to breach basic norms of due process and ordered justice.  See also: Binance Executive Jailed in Nigeria is Suspected of Having Malaria: Family Says  An official pronouncement that an individual has been “wrongfully detained,” for example, carries with it an impetus under federal statutes and regulations toward the issuing of economic sanctions against targeted foreign officials. That prospect in turn carries risks for restricting negotiating and policy space, as well as the risk of inefficacy where other countries fail to implement similar economic countermeasures.  The United States has, however, a well-tailored tool at its disposal for signaling its objection to Nigeria’s abuse of its police power, while revoking significant funds that otherwise might go toward the very authorities now engaged in that abuse. In response to the patently unjustified charges against Gambaryan, the United States should immediately cease the transfer of forfeited funds to Nigeria under the Department of Justice’s “international sharing” program.  International sharing of forfeited assets  The Department of Justice collaborates every day with law enforcement agencies across the world. Those collaborations include joint investigations and operations ranging from anti-terrorism to cross-border money laundering to cybersecurity and beyond. In DOJ’s work to battle international kleptocracy and its ill effects on U.S. business and global populations, international partnerships are especially indispensable.  As one means of fostering that international cooperation, U.S. law provides a mechanism for the DOJ (and in certain instances, the Department of Treasury) to reward foreign partners for assistance in law enforcement actions through the “sharing” of forfeited property – that is, proceeds of crime seized by the DOJ in the course of its prosecutions – with those foreign partners. The procedures for determining when, how much and to whom forfeited assets may be shared is generally governed by treaty or other memoranda of understanding, and requires both the approval of the Attorney General (or Secretary of the Treasury) and the concurrence of the Secretary of State.  See also: Binance Exec Tigran Gambaryan Denied Bail  Importantly, these programs are entirely discretionary: “Whenever property is civilly or criminally forfeited ... the Attorney General or the Secretary of the Treasury, as the case may be, may transfer the forfeited [property] to any foreign country which participated directly or indirectly in the seizure or forfeiture of the property.” When invoked, the transfer of assets under these programs can be both symbolically and materially important for foreign partners. A recent international sharing agreement reached between the United States and Estonia, for example, was designed to route much needed funding to Ukraine – a transfer heavy with both symbolic and material significance.  The withholding of such transfers consequently carries a similar moral and material weight.  Nigeria and international sharing  Nigeria has accused Gambaryan – again, a mid-tier employee whose role at Binance has no conceivable connection to the accusation – of engaging in a $35 million money laundering scheme. Coincidentally, the Department of Justice in fiscal year 2023 transferred just over $20 million to Nigeria through the Department’s international sharing program. In 2020 that amount was over $310 million. This should stop.  As a discretionary program, the DOJ, Treasury and the State Department are all empowered to cease these transfers under the international sharing protocols. They should do so here, when the purpose of the program – to incentivize foreign partners to uphold the rule of law through cooperation with U.S. enforcement efforts – is frustrated through transparently arbitrary, lawless prosecutions.  A decision and announcement to halt forfeiture transfers to Nigeria has the benefit of imposing a direct cost on the Nigerian authorities and legal apparatus that is directly implicated by the Binance affair. The withholding of shared funding requires no intermediaries or multilateral coalition to make that U.S. policy decision an effective deterrent – no banks or foreign partners are required to amplify this policy, as would be the case with a formal sanctions designation against particular individuals or institutions in Nigeria.  The discretionary aspect of the program also provides for negotiating space and diplomatic flexibility. Unlike standard economic sanctions programs, there is no need for a politically charged “rollback” of an announced designation – U.S. agencies would simply be poised to resume cooperative sharing based on a straightforward, tangible change in Nigeria’s behavior, namely the release and exoneration of a wrongfully detained American citizen.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB,Andrew C.

On Tuesday, IBIT held $19.68B worth of the Bitcoin token, toppling the $19.65B that was held by GBTC. BlackRock ( BLK ) is the world's largest asset manager. IBIT, which was launched back on January 11th of this year, has now advanced 38.6% year-to-date and has amassed nearly $20B in assets under management as investors flock towards the world's now leading Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) backed exchange-traded fund. Moreover, in just the last two trading weeks dating back to May 15, IBIT has observed a large influx of cash that totals $669.03M, which followed the $1.62B that was attracted during the entire month of April. IBIT’s popularity can also be seen through its average daily volume. Currently, IBIT’s 30-day average volume amount in shares is just over 25M shares per day. While IBIT has become the new assets under management leader in the Bitcoin ETF sphere, it's not the only Bitcoin focused fund to have built up its assets. Other funds also include: ( FBTC ).

He recently hinted that a parabolic move is imminent for Bitcoin and altcoins, following his statement that the market has entered an important phase in this bull cycle. Crypto Market Has Began “Macro Bullish Expansion” TechDev mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that “the entire crypto market has just begun its first macro bullish expansion in three and a half years.” The analyst shared a bi-monthly chart of the total crypto market cap, which showed that the market was currently at a similar stage to 2020, just before the 2021 bull market came into full force and crypto tokens began to enjoy a significant upward trend. Related Reading: XRP Price Moves To Break Out Of 7-Year Accumulation, Analyst Highlights Possible 1,200% Rally From the chart he shared, one could also deduce that Tech Dev was hinting that the crypto tokens had completely undergone a healthy consolidation phase and were well primed for this parabolic move to the upside. That is why the crypto analyst made reference to the ‘macro bullish expansion,’ with these coins ready to break out from the range at which they have been trading for some time now. Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto also seemed to agree with TechDev’s analysis. He shared a Bitcoin chart that showed that the flagship crypto was ready for its next leg up, which would send it to almost $90,000. Meanwhile, in an earlier X post, TechDev mentioned that Bitcoin and altcoins were “poised” to rip through the charts. He highlighted on the chart he shared that Bitcoin is about to have a God candle that would send it past its current all-time high (ATH) of $73,000. Altcoins were also at a stage where they would significantly move to the upside. TechDev had also previously suggested that Bitcoin was currently mirroring its price action from 2021, when the flagship crypto experienced a 1,200% price surge as it rose to $20,000. This raised the possibility of Bitcoin enjoying such a parabolic move again, which could send its price to almost $1 million. Bitcoin Is Still Consolidating For Now While TechDev suggested that a parabolic move for Bitcoin and altcoins is imminent, crypto analyst Rekt Capital has provided a different insight. He claimed that Bitcoin is showing signs that its recent rebound “has fed into the formation of another local top,” suggesting that this recent move wasn’t a continuation of the bull run just yet. Related Reading: Market Expert Says XRP Price Reaching $1,000 Is Inevitable, Here’s Why The crypto analyst added that history suggests that Bitcoin will likely continue to consolidate between $60,000 and $70,000 in the meantime.

AI has captured the attention of the technology world for the last year and a half, with concerns aired that tech giants like Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG) and Meta (META) will establish a hegemony over the sector. That's partly what spurred the Web3 companies to try to build a decentralized AI infrastructure, where data is transparent and shared openly between contributors.  The three individual tokens are all up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. The broader digital asset market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) has dropped around 0.55%.

Gemini announced Wednesday that its Gemini Earn users have received all their digital assets back in-kind.  This means, for instance, that if a customer lent one bitcoin to the Earn program, they will receive one bitcoin back, the company said in a release.  Gemini said Earn users have received $2.18 billion of their digital assets back in-kind. This represents a 232% recovery from when Genesis, Gemini's Earn partner, halted withdrawals, causing Gemini to pause withdrawals on its Earn program.  Since then, bitcoin is up over 200% according to CoinDesk Indices data.  Gemini first announced that it planned to return 100% of customers' assets back in February as part of the conclusion of Genesis' bankruptcy.  ""From the start, Gemini’s goal was to obtain the return of 100% of its users’ digital assets from Genesis, and Gemini was dedicated to a coin-for-coin recovery,"" Anson Frelinghuysen, a partner at Hughes Hubbard & Reed LLP and Gemini’s lead bankruptcy counsel, said in a statement to CoinDesk.  Gemini contributed $50 million to ensure Earn users' recovery, with 97% of digital assets distributed today and the remaining balance expected within 12 months, it said in a release.  ""Throughout the restructuring process, Gemini steadfastly advocated for its users and, as a result of these efforts, was able to obtain a completely unprecedented 232% overall recovery for Gemini Earn users,"" Frelinghuysen continued.  Lawsuits and regulator interest  The relationship between Genesis and Gemini has been the subject of a lawsuit between the two companies, and interest from both the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as well as the New York Attorney General.  In October 2023, Gemini sued Genesis Global Capital for $1.6 billion over 60 million Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares pledged as collateral.  The lawsuit claims that controlling these shares would satisfy the claims of Gemini Earn customers affected by Genesis freezing withdrawals in 2022. Concurrently, Genesis has sued Gemini to recover $689 million, alleging preferential transfers that unfairly benefited Gemini at the expense of other creditors.  Later, in March 2024, Genesis Global Capital agreed to pay a $21 million civil penalty to settle SEC charges related to the Gemini Earn program.  As part of Genesis' bankruptcy, a court approved a $2 billion settlement by the New York Attorney General to establish a victims' fund for New Yorkers who invested over $1.1 billion through the Gemini Earn program and barred Genesis from operating in the state.  “It’s important to note that the Genesis bankruptcy was not a crypto problem,” said Tyler Winklevoss, Co-Founder and CEO of Gemini, in a statement. “It was old-fashioned financial fraud compounded by a lack of regulatory clarity.""

28631806,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=610383,1716989434,Time To Stack Stellar (XLM)? Analyst Calls For Epic 500% Price Breakout,"Stellar Lumens (XLM), the cryptocurrency known for its fast and cheap cross-border transactions, has been on a quiet journey lately. While the broader crypto market experiences wild swings, XLM trades sideways, seemingly unfazed by the drama. But is this calmness a sign of stagnation, or is Stellar poised for a stellar (pun intended) breakout? Related Reading: Crystal Ball Or Crazy Talk? Analyst Predicts Bitcoin To Hit $156,000 By May 2025 Trading In The Twilight Zone Currently, XLM sits at $0.10, a price point it’s clung to for weeks. Trading volume is moderate, and the overall market sentiment leans slightly bearish. This might lead some to believe XLM is stuck in a rut. However, analysts like Javon Marks see this as a potential launchpad. Technical Whispers: A Bullish Undercurrent Marks, a respected crypto analyst, believes XLM is quietly brewing a bullish storm. He points to a recent breakout from a key resistance level, a technical indicator suggesting a potential price surge. This breakout, according to Marks, sets a target of a staggering $0.681 for XLM. $XLM (Stellar) has confirmed a bullish indication that can be indicating a continuation to be developing and with already broken out prices, it can be of notable size! With these prices being broken out of a massive resisting trend, the target is at $0.681, meaning a >495% run… https://t.co/vwyEOVqX78 pic.twitter.com/2oMmCZPazQ — JAVON⚡️MARKS (@JavonTM1) May 27, 2024 Reaching For The Stars: A 495% Price Increase? If Marks’ prediction holds true, XLM investors could witness a phenomenal 495% increase from current prices. This potential moon mission has some analysts urging investors to keep a close eye on XLM. Beyond The Price Tag: Stellar’s Core Strength While the price prediction is undoubtedly exciting, it’s important to remember Stellar’s core strengths. Its focus on facilitating fast and affordable cross-border payments positions it well for potential future adoption. Partnerships with financial institutions and its commitment to low transaction fees could be catalysts for long-term growth, regardless of short-term price fluctuations. A Stellar Investment Or A Gamble On The Stars? Javon Marks’ prediction presents a tantalizing possibility for XLM investors. However, the road to $0.681 is likely to be bumpy. Despite a 20% increase in the past year, Stellar (XLM) has underperformed relative to the broader crypto market. Specifically, 72% of the top 100 crypto assets have outpaced XLM’s growth, and it has also lagged behind major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Related Reading: Forget Fear, Embrace Greed? Bitcoin Soars As Sentiment Turns Red Hot This underperformance highlights potential concerns regarding its relative strength and market position. Trading below its 200-day simple moving average suggests that XLM is currently in a bearish phase, struggling to maintain a positive long-term trend. Additionally, XLM has only experienced 9 green days in the last 30 days, accounting for just 30% of the time. This lack of consistent positive momentum is worrisome for investors seeking short-term gains. Furthermore, the asset is down a staggering 88% from its all-time high, indicating significant downside risk and potential long-term challenges. These factors combined present a cautious outlook for XLM, suggesting that it may face continued difficulties in the near future unless it can overcome these technical and performance-related obstacles.

The launch could bring new interest to a modestly sized crypto asset that hasn’t caught fire despite its name-brand backing. PYUSD has around 8,600 holders on the Ethereum blockchain and a market cap of a tick under $400 million—tiny compared to the largesse of its competitors from Circle and Tether, crypto-native firms.  “Ethereum works well enough,” said PayPal's Senior Vice President of Blockchain, Jose Fernandez da Ponte. ""But if you’re interested in retail payments as we are, basically you need at least 1000 transactions per second, and you need transaction costs in the pennies, not in the dollars.""  Beyond cost and speed PYUSD also has new superpowers on Solana that weren't possible on Ethereum.

Flashback to 2022: Crypto Insurance Firm Evertas Wins Lloyd’s of London Approval  ISACs are common in mainstream industries such as financial services, defense and aviation. They share intelligence about cybersecurity vulnerabilities and incidents between businesses and governments and are often compared to neighborhood watch programs.  Crypto ISAC aims to not only thwart cybercrime but build legitimacy and credibility with government and law enforcement for an industry long regarded as a lawless Wild West.

Senior cybersecurity executives from Circle, Coinbase, Consensys, Fireblocks, and Solana will appear Wednesday at CoinDesk's Consensus 2024 event in Austin, Texas, to discuss their involvement in the ISAC.

28629751,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=610360,1716985813,"Research Firm Projects Ethereum Explosion To $15,000 With ETF Inflows","Michael Nadeau, founder of The DeFi Report, has published a deep dive into the implications of the approval of spot Ethereum (ETH) Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) on the cryptocurrency’s price trajectory. This analysis follows on the heels of a significant regulatory nod from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which approved the 19b-4 applications for eight leading financial entities — Grayscale, Bitwise, BlackRock, VanEck, Ark 21Shares, Invesco, Fidelity, and Franklin. These approvals, granted under a collective omnibus order on May 23, set the stage for the final steps, which involve awaiting S-1 registrations’ sign-offs before these spot ETFs can start trading. Why Ethereum Could Skyrocket To $15,000 The report draws upon projections by ETF experts at Bloomberg, such as James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, suggesting that the inflows into Ethereum ETFs could range between 10-20% of those experienced by Bitcoin ETFs. “The logic behind these projections rests on a few key observations—currently, there is less institutional interest in ETH, and it is inherently more complex than BTC. Also, the ETH futures ETF volume is considerably less than BTC’s, ranging from 10-20%, and ETH spot trading volumes are roughly half of BTC’s,” Nadeau explains. He added that “ETH is more difficult to understand than BTC. ETH futures ETF volume is less than BTC (10-20%). ETH spot trading volumes are less than BTC (about 50%). ETH is about 1/3 of BTC’s market cap.” Related Reading: Ethereum Spot ETFs: Report Shows Grayscale Could Keep ETH Price Down With $110M Daily Outflows However, according to the researcher, the dynamics of Ethereum offer a unique perspective when compared to Bitcoin. “Ethereum validators do not incur the substantial operating expenses that Bitcoin miners do, which mitigates the structural sell pressure on the asset,” Nadeau states. This difference is critical in understanding the supply-side dynamics of Ethereum compared to Bitcoin. Nadeau also delves into the current status of Ethereum on-chain activities. A substantial portion of Ethereum, approximately 38%, is effectively ‘soft locked’ across various mechanisms like staking contracts and DeFi applications. This scenario, as Nadeau points out, “helps reduce the available circulating supply, contributing to a decrease in ETH balances on exchanges to levels not seen since 2016—currently, this stands at less than 11% of the circulating supply.” The concept of reflexivity in Ethereum’s market behavior also receives significant attention in Nadeau’s report. “ETH is more reflexive than BTC. This reflexivity could be expressed with price action leading onchain activity, which leads to more ETH burned, which can further drive narratives, more price action, more onchain activity, and more ETH burned,” Nadeau elaborates, suggesting a cyclic effect that could significantly amplify Ethereum’s market presence and valuation. Related Reading: Ethereum Deposits At 4-Month High: Whales Preparing For Selloff? Exploring potential market scenarios, Nadeau questions the extent of rebalancing that might occur from spot Bitcoin ETF holders towards Ethereum, the attractiveness of a 50/50 BTC and ETH allocation, and the potential shift of institutional focus towards Ethereum. He hypothesizes, “If momentum hits ETH, will we see the ‘reflexivity flywheel’ kick into gear? How many institutions are on the sideline right now, having missed BTC? Will they go all in on ETH?” In concluding his analysis, Nadeau presents a valuation framework that anticipates the cryptocurrency market reaching a $10 trillion market cap. He states, “Given our fundamental views on ETH, we think it’s more likely that ETH will outperform Bloomberg’s projections of 10-20% of BTC’s net inflows. Under this scenario” and projects that “ETH could command a market cap at cycle peak of $1.8 trillion, which would price ETH at approximately $14,984 (3.9x), assuming no change in supply.” He continues, “For reference, if Bitcoin reaches a $4 trillion market cap, that would price BTC at $202,000 (2.8x)” at cycle peak. At press time, ETH was trading at $3,823, still around 29 % away from its 2021 all-time high.

Payment service providers would get access to the system to provide advanced payment options to the general public.  Israel's central bank is launching a Digital Shekel Challenge as part of an ""action plan for a possible issuance of the digital shekel,"" to develop uses in the world of payments, it announced Tuesday.  The Bank of Israel said it had built a technological prototype ""simulating the heart of the digital shekel system."" Payment-service providers would get access to the system to provide advanced payment options to the general public. Among the payment types to be explored are micropayments, split payments and payments requiring multiparty signatures, according to the call for participants.  ""In the challenge, for the first time, we allow the financial industry from Israel and abroad and a wide variety of stakeholders in the payments system to cooperate with us in a practical way in thinking, planning and designing the digital shekel,"" said Andrew Abir, deputy governor of the Bank of Israel.  The Bank of Israel has not yet decided whether to issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC), even as it continues its yearslong exploration of the technology.  In 2021, it said it had already carried out a pilot test and last year it said it was monitoring scenarios – including whether stablecoins are widely used. It also conducted a project with Hong Kong and the Bank for International Settlement (BIS) to probe how the systems can be protected from hacks.  The challenge will kick off with an everything-you-wanted-to-ask webinar on June 6, and go through a process of applications and presentations before culminating at the end of September when results will be discussed. A date for final meetings and announcement of the results has not been set.  The challenge is inspired by the BIS Innovation Centre's ""Rosalind Project,"" which looked at how application programming interface (API) functionalities could support a retail CBDC and facilitate safe and secure payments, the announcement said.  ""This initiative is a significant step for the Israeli ecosystem, potentially bridging the gap between the web3 industry and government, even though DeFi, ZK and permissionless solutions are not yet being considered,"" said Saul Rejwan, managing partner at Masterkey VC.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Crypto markets were muted during the European morning, with bitcoin appearing to consolidate around $68,000 following its rally to $70,000 at the start of the week. BTC is priced at just over $67,800 at the time of writing, around 1% less than 24 hours ago. The broader digital asset market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), has dropped about 0.65% during that time. ETH meanwhile is trading just above $3,800, down a little over 2% in the last 24 hours as the market awaits further news on the listing of spot ether ETFs in the U.S. following last week's SEC approval of some filings by prospective providers.  BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF has leapfrogged Grayscale's to become the largest of its kind after a $102 million inflow on Tuesday. BlackRock's IBIT holds nearly $20 billion worth of bitcoin, compared with GBTC's $19.7 billion. GBTC saw $105 million in outflows on Tuesday. Buying activity for IBIT ramped up recently amid bullish sentiment for bitcoin and the broader crypto market. The bulls gained momentum after the ether ETF filings approvals and renewed support for crypto among U.S. political parties. That helped mark a sudden shift in IBIT, which recorded low or even zero inflows before May 15 and saw its first-ever day of outflows in April, leading to bearish sentiment.  Riot Platforms has the capacity to consolidate the bitcoin mining sector, broker Bernstein said in a report. Riot is trying to acquire rival miner Bitfarms, after buying a 9.25% stake in the company. “The bitcoin mining business is becoming tougher for smaller players, with limited capital to ramp up on the global hash power race,” Bernstein analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra wrote. Bernstein says it expects the U.S. bitcoin mining industry to consolidate to about five large players who will control substantial capacity. There are more than 20 publicly listed miners at present. The largest bitcoin miners should ramp up their M&A plans to maintain “long-term strategic relevance,” Bernstein noted.  Chart of the Day  The top 10 cryptocurrencies by open interest now include four meme coins, of which DOGE leads the charge with $1 billion in futures bets.  Rising interest is considered to be a sign of future price volatility, which traders can use to position their bets.  The recent rise in open interest for meme coins comes from their bullish momentum over the past couple of weeks as PEPE hit a new all-time high.  However, data shows that funding rates for meme coins remained negative across crypto exchanges, indicating a bearish sentiment regarding the cost of holding positions.

Analyst Predicts Bitcoin To Hit $156,000 By May 2025","The enigmatic world of Bitcoin continues to captivate investors with its price fluctuations. However, a recent analysis by Cryptorphic, a prominent crypto analyst, suggests the future might be brighter than recent dips might indicate. Their prediction? Bitcoin hitting a staggering $156,000 by May 27th, 2025. Related Reading: Forget Fear, Embrace Greed? Bitcoin Soars As Sentiment Turns Red Hot The Halving Effect: A Historical Catalyst Cryptorphic’s prediction hinges on a historical phenomenon known as the halving. Every four years, the number of Bitcoins rewarded for mining new blocks is cut in half. This, in theory, reduces the supply of new coins entering the market, potentially driving up the price of existing ones. His analysis examines past halvings, showcasing a fascinating trend. Following the first halving in 2012, Bitcoin’s price skyrocketed a mind-blowing 8,300%. The second halving in 2016 saw a more modest but still impressive increase of 288%. The most recent halving in 2020 sparked a 540% surge within a year. #Bitcoin could hit $156,000 by May 27 2025! These green boxes represent the price action after #BTC halvings. We’ve never seen a red year after a halving. Bitcoin halvings are significant events, here are the percentages of Bitcoin’s price increase one year after each halving… pic.twitter.com/QEmNN8OuP2 — Cryptorphic (@Cryptorphic1) May 27, 2024 A Golden Ticket Or Fool’s Gold? Following the fourth halving last April, Cryptorphic predicts a potential price surge of nearly 130% by the following year. This translates to a price tag of anywhere between $115,000 and $156,000. Despite the bullish outlook, the analysis acknowledges the current short-term volatility. Bitcoin is currently trading below its peak, reflecting a recent 5% dip. However, Cryptorphic identifies a technical indicator, the “inverse head and shoulders” pattern, suggesting a potential breakout for the price. A Broader Market View The analyst’s perspective doesn’t shy away from presenting contrasting viewpoints. Others take a more nuanced approach, expressing cautious optimism for the short-term trajectory. They acknowledge the diminishing bearish scenarios and believe the market might be in an earlier bullish phase compared to Cryptorphic’s prediction. This suggests the potential for further gains even before 2025, although both analysts emphasize the importance of a measured approach to risk management.

The broker said it expects the U.S. bitcoin mining space to consolidate to around five large players.  Bernstein said the larger miners should ramp up their M&A game to maintain strategic relevance.  Riot Platforms (RIOT) is the most ambitious bitcoin {{BTC}} miner to attempt to consolidate the sector, and the company has a desire to build the world’s largest publicly listed mining company, broker Bernstein said in a research report on Tuesday.  The Colorado-based company has the financial capacity to consolidate the mining space as it has no debt and more than $1.3 billion of cash and bitcoin on its balance sheet, the report said.  Riot is trying to acquire rival bitcoin miner Bitfarms (BITF), after buying a 9.25% stake in the company. The miner has offered to buy all the outstanding shares in BITF for $2.30, the company said on Tuesday.  “The bitcoin mining business is becoming tougher for smaller players, with limited capital to ramp up on the global hash power race,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra wrote.  Bernstein says it expects the bitcoin mining sector in the U.S. to consolidate to about five large players who will control substantial capacity. It noted that there are more than 20 publicly listed miners at present.  “If power becomes the biggest constraint to scale up artificial intelligence (AI) computation, we see bitcoin miners as a strategic asset controlling power, land and with significant operating capabilities in running data centers,” the authors wrote.  The broker notes that smaller miners are seeing competitive interest from AI data centers that are looking to buy sites. The largest bitcoin miners should ramp up their M&A plans to maintain “long-term strategic relevance,” the report noted.  Bernstein has an outperform rating on Riot shares and a $22 price target. At the time of writing, the shares were trading around $10.30.

The surge in meme coins such as shiba inu, was probably driven by Asia-based traders and linked to the excitement around the potential for a pro-crypto shift by U.S. regulators.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}} prices fell a little more than 1% in the past 24 hours as crypto markets remained mostly muted after last week's rally.  With major tokens such as Solana's SOL, XRP and BNB Chain's BNB little changed, the meme coin sector drove the biggest gains for traders among categories tracked by CoinGecko, including shiba inu {{SHIB}} climbing as much as 12%. The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), an index of the largest tokens that omits stablecoins, lost 0.5%.  A surge in dogecoin {{DOGE}} and SHIB started during European afternoon hours Tuesday as stocks of videogame retailer GameStop (GME) rose up 19% in premarket trading, a signal that has historically led to gains in meme tokens.  ""Popular memes are running primarily due to Asian traders entering the market again - most tend to see their prices rise most significantly during Asian trading hours, during the middle of the night US time,"" Rennick Palley, founding partner at crypto fund Stratos, said in an emailed statement.  ""This is a follow-on effect to excitement around the ETH ETF and US regulatory shift to becoming more pro-crypto,"" Palley added.  As previously reported, meme tokens such as pepe {{PEPE}} and mog (MOG) have rocketed as much as 100% in the past week as a beta bet on the Ethereum ecosystem. This is on the back of U.S. listing approvals for a spot ether exchange-traded fund (ETF).  Bitcoin, meantime, remains in a bearish trading range despite recent volatility, according to FxPro senior market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich.  ""A clear exit and daily close above $70,000 will break this bearish pattern.

28623315,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=610334,1716974740,Whales Push Bitcoin Into Narrow Consolidation Range: What To Expect Next,"Recent analytical insights from FireCharts 2.0 are indicating significant maneuvers by major stakeholders of Bitcoin—often referred to as “whales”—which are impacting the cryptocurrency’s price movements. These stakeholders are altering liquidity patterns in a manner that suggests a strategic push towards a more tightly controlled trading range. What Bitcoin Whales Are Up To According to Material Indicators, an advanced trading analytics, there has been a noticeable adjustment in the distribution of liquidity within Bitcoin’s order book. Specifically, there is a decrease in ask liquidity at higher price points, coupled with an increase in bid liquidity starting from $60,000 to $67,000. This dynamic is set to compress Bitcoin’s price into a narrower range, a scenario anticipated by the platform since the digital asset escalated above $52,000. The discussions about Bitcoin’s price trajectory have been rife with speculation about a potential pump to $73,000, especially following its bounce from a low of $52,000. Despite a recent high near $70,600, which ended in a sharp rejection, the sentiment remains cautiously optimistic. “There has been a lot of chatter since late last week calling for a pump to $73k, and there are legitimate reasons why that is a near term target, and why it is still possible despite the rejection from $70.6k we saw on Monday,” noted Material Indicators. Related Reading: Is Mt. Gox A Worry For Bitcoin? Crypto Analyst Weighs In From a macroeconomic perspective, Bitcoin’s prospects appear exceedingly bullish. “The outlook for Bitcoin is literally as bullish as it’s ever been,” said a representative from Material Indicators during a recent livestream. They refrained from reiterating the specifics, urging viewers to revisit the previous week’s analysis for a deeper understanding. In contrast, the technical analysis paints a more nuanced picture. Despite the favorable macro outlook, Bitcoin has continuously failed to confirm a resistance/support (R/S) flip at $69,000—a crucial level for confirming bullish momentum. This ongoing failure is emblematic of the bulls’ struggle to maintain upward pressure and secure a new all-time high (ATH). By integrating order book data with technical indicators, analysts have observed a progressive downward movement in blocks of ask liquidity, from initial placements around $75,000-$76,000 to recent figures near $70,000-$71,500. Looking forward, the pivotal question is: how low can Bitcoin realistically go before finding substantial support? To address this, analysts at Material Indicators turn to a combination of technical analysis and real-time order book data. The convergence of Bitcoin’s 21-Day, 50-Day, and 100-Day Moving Averages around $65,000-$66,000 offers a compelling case for potential support. The 21-Day MA, in particular, is favored for its historical reliability as both resistance and support. Related Reading: Why The Bitcoin Halving Is Not Priced In And What’s Next: Expert Order book data corroborates this analysis, showing a strengthening of ask liquidity resistance above $70,000, while bid liquidity is strategically placed down to as low as $58,000. The largest concentrations of bid liquidity indicate the strongest support at $60,000 and $65,000, with somewhat lesser support around $66,000 and $67,000. Despite the complex interplay of factors in the near term, the long-term perspective remains overwhelmingly bullish. The essential query for the market is when, not if, a legitimate breakout will take place. Observations from the order book show more than $200 million in asks stacked from $71,000 to $75,000, juxtaposed with around $90 million in bids between $65,000 and $67,000. If ask liquidity does not thin out, bid liquidity will need to strengthen significantly to trigger a sustainable break into the $70s. According to Material Indicators, the most favorable scenario would see Bitcoin establish a firm consolidation range above $65,000, validate an R/S Flip at $69,000, and stabilize above this level before aiming for a new ATH. Such a development would not only confirm the bullish trend but also pave the way for sustained upward momentum based on the current order book trends and technical analyses. This trajectory, they suggest, would provide the healthiest market progression in light of the existing conditions. At press time, BTC traded at $67,832.

Ripple also made a $25 million donation to Fairshake in 2023, bringing its total contribution to the political action committee (PAC) to a whopping $50 million.  Ripple’s donations account for roughly half of the more than $100 million Fairshake has raised from major players in the crypto space, including crypto exchanges Coinbase and Gemini, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and asset manager ARK Invest.  Many in the crypto industry see the 2024 elections as a critical opportunity to elect pro-crypto candidates – and oust less-than-friendly candidates, such as Congresswoman Katie Porter (D-Calif.), an ally of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), whose bid for Senate was squashed with the help of a $10 million campaign from Fairshake.  In a Wednesday announcement, Ripple attributed its contribution to Fairshake as “part of an industry-wide effort to advance policies that support the next generation of financial innovation in the U.S.”  The announcement specifically discussed the role of federal regulators, saying that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approach of “trying to regulate crypto by enforcement has failed” and that the U.S. must act now to craft a “positive regulatory landscape” for crypto that will foster innovation.  ""Our contributions to Fairshake are just one of the many ways Ripple will actively invest in educating voters on the role crypto will play in the future and the dangers of the anti-crypto stance some policymakers are clinging to in Washington,"" saidRipple CEO Brad Garlinghouse in a press statement. ""Ripple will not – and the crypto industry should not – keep quiet while unelected regulators actively seek to impede innovation and economic growth that millions of Americans utilize.

On Tuesday, BlackRock added the bitcoin ETF to its income and bond-focused funds in the first quarter.

The decentralized public blockchain, which facilitates the transfer of XRP, fiat currencies, and other digital assets, has demonstrated substantial activity. XRP Ledger Burn Rate Slows Amid Low Fees During Q1 2024, XRP, the native token of the XRPL, secured its position as the sixth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, reaching $34.1 billion (currently $29M). Despite a slight price decrease, XRP’s circulating market cap witnessed a 1.3% growth quarter-over-quarter (QoQ). Related Reading: Forget Fear, Embrace Greed? Bitcoin Soars As Sentiment Turns Red Hot The XRPL employs a deflationary mechanism by systematically burning transaction fees. This process exerts downward pressure on the total supply of XRP, which stands at 100 billion tokens. Since the inception of the XRP Ledger, approximately 12 million XRP have been burned. However, the low burn rate during Q1 can be attributed to the network’s relatively low transaction fees (less than $0.002 per transaction). Additionally, 1 billion XRP is released from escrow to Ripple each month, with any unutilized tokens being placed into new escrow contracts. This pattern will continue until the remaining approximately 45 billion XRP becomes liquid; at this point, the deflationary pressure from burned fees will be the primary variable affecting supply. While XRP’s price decreased marginally 0.1% QoQ, lagging behind the overall crypto market’s 63.0% increase, it rose 14.8% year over year (YoY). Inscription-Fueled Transactions Propel XRPL Daily Payments The report highlights that revenue in the XRPL is measured as total fees collected by the network, which are subsequently burned, contributing to the redistribution of wealth from transaction fee spenders to XRP holders. Network activity showed significant growth, with active addresses and transactions increasing by 37% and 113% QoQ, respectively. A substantial portion of transaction activity on the XRPL stemmed from inscriptions, a transaction type popularized in early 2023. Over 30 million transactions were sent to a single account by approximately 45,000 accounts engaged in inscription-related activities. According to Messari, inscriptions, facilitated by XRP Script, played a key role in driving the surge in daily payments, which soared 350% QoQ to 2 million transactions. Related Reading: $2.9 Billion In Mt. Gox Bitcoin On The Move For The First Time In 5 Years, Where Is It Headed? Lastly, the report notes that the XRP Ledger blockchain witnessed a net increase of 150,000 accounts, driving the total number of accounts up by 3.1% to 5.15 million in Q1. However, new addresses decreased 12.4% QoQ to 183,000, primarily due to the high number of addresses created in Q4, coinciding with the inception of inscription activity. As of press time, XRP is valued at $0.5279, down 2.5% in the past 24 hours and 3.5% in the past seven days, which is in line with the broader market trend.

ADA must stay above the $0.450 support to start a fresh upward move. ADA price is struggling to gain bullish momentum above the $0.4750 zone. The price is trading below $0.460 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $0.4570 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if there is a close above $0.4620. Cardano Price Tests Support In the past few sessions, Cardano started a downward move after it failed to clear the $0.4750 resistance. ADA dipped below the $0.4620 support and tested the key support at $0.4520 like Bitcoin and Ethereum. A low was formed at $0.4516 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor recovery wave above the $0.4550 zone. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $0.4570 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. The pair tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.4743 swing high to the $0.4516 low. Cardano is now trading below $0.4620 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $0.4960 zone. The first resistance is near $0.4620 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.4743 swing high to the $0.4516 low. The next key resistance might be $0.4750. If there is a close above the $0.4750 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.50 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $0.5250. More Losses in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $0.4620 resistance level, it could continue to move down. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.4520 level. The next major support is near the $0.4460 level. A downside break below the $0.4460 level could open the doors for a test of $0.4320.

It is now testing key support at $0.5220 and remains at risk of more downsides. XRP is struggling to gain bullish momentum above the $0.5350 resistance zone. The price is now trading below $0.530 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.5265 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase unless the bears push the price below $0.5220. XRP Price Revisits Support In the past two sessions, XRP price saw a bearish move below the $0.5320 zone like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price declined below the $0.5250 support zone before the bulls emerged. A low was formed at $0.5212 and the price is now consolidating losses. It made a recovery attempt above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.5405 swing high to the $0.5212 low. However, the bears are active near the $0.5300 zone.

The first key resistance is near $0.5320 or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.5405 swing high to the $0.5212 low. A close above the $0.5320 resistance zone could send the price higher. The next key resistance is near $0.540. If there is a close above the $0.540 resistance level, there could be a steady increase toward the $0.5450 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.5650 resistance. More Downsides? If XRP fails to clear the $0.5320 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5220 level. The next major support is at $0.5120. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5120 level, the price might gain bearish momentum. In the stated case, the price could decline and retest the $0.50 support in the near term.

28608099,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=610261,1716948051,Is Mt. Gox A Worry For Bitcoin? Crypto Analyst Weighs In,"Bitcoin outflows from the Mt. Gox exchange have occurred in the past day, making some worry about potential bearish effects. Here’s what an analyst thinks. Mt. Gox Has Made Several Bitcoin Transactions In The Last 24 Hours During the past day, several movements from wallets associated with the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox have been spotted on the Bitcoin blockchain. The platform had announced plans to repay its creditors, so the transactions are likely related to them. Mt. Gox has moved out 137,890 BTC in total, worth almost $9.4 billion at the current cryptocurrency exchange rate. With these transfers, the market has become concerned about whether these tokens will move towards trading, adding to the selling pressure in the market. Related Reading: Ethereum Deposits At 4-Month High: Whales Preparing For Selloff? As a result, the BTC price has fallen about 4% in the past 24 hours. While the market has reacted negatively to the news so far, some have wondered whether these withdrawals are actually going to be bearish. Analyst James Van Straten discussed this in an X post and provided perspective on how a potential selloff arising out of these repayments would compare against another that BTC witnessed recently. The distribution event in question is from the long-term holders (LTHs), which make up one of the two main divisions of the BTC market based on holding time. All investors holding onto their coins since more than 155 days ago qualify for this cohort, while those who bought within the past 155 days are put in the short-term holder (STH) group. The LTHs are considered to be the resolute side of the market, as they rarely participate in selloffs, while the STHs are the fickle-minded investors who regularly react to sector events by panic selling. The recent rally in the asset, though, proved to be enough to move even these HODLers into selling, as the chart below shows their total supply. As the graph shows, the LTH supply has been moving sideways in the last couple of months, but it was in a state of decline for five months before that. In this selloff, the LTHs sold around 1 million tokens, of which around 340,000 BTC was linked to GBTC outflows. At the same time, this distribution from the LTHs occurred, though the coin’s price marched to a new all-time high, implying that the market could absorb this massive selling pressure just fine. Straten notes that the Mt. Gox repayments are only about a tenth of this selloff, and not everyone who will get these tokens will decide to sell. At the very least, everyone wouldn’t sell at the same time. Related Reading: Injective (INJ) Buy Signal That Led To 700% & 555% Rallies Forms Again Thus, given this fact, it’s possible that Bitcoin may not be affected by this distribution if demand for the cryptocurrency remains as strong as it has been recently.

28608040,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=610297,1716948043,Is Solana Preparing For Liftoff Or Meltdown? Analysts Forecast SOL’s Future,"After the recent market pump, Solana (SOL) recovered an important support zone. As a result, analysts have debated whether the altcoin is poised for a liftoff to a new all-time high (ATH) or about to face a meltdown. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Eyes a Strong Comeback: Will the Rally Ignite a Surge? Analysts Fear SOL’s Top Is In After recovering the $160 support zone over a week ago, Solana reached heights not seen since the beginning of April. SOL neared the $190 resistance level but failed to surpass it. Instead, the token’s price hovered between the $180 and $170 mark before returning near the $160 support zone over the weekend. Despite underperforming compared to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), the token reached a new ATH in a key metric during this cycle. In March, Solana’s market capitalization surpassed its previous ATH, reaching a market cap of $93 billion. Last week’s pump saw SOL surge by over 56% from its price during the May 1 retrace, propelling its market cap above its 2021 ATH to levels resembling March’s ATH. Nonetheless, some crypto analysts see the possibility of a meltdown ahead for Solana. Crypto analyst Bluntz posted a video looking at SOL’s macro chart. Per the post, the analyst considers that “SOL is done, SOL is exhausted, and it’s probably time for ETH to catch up, which will probably be the last leg of the bull market.” The analyst considers the macro chart to display some concerning signs that suggest the token has “probably topped.” Per Bluntz’s chart, SOL had a five-way climb to its cycle high of $210 in March. Despite not making the price ATH due to inflation, the analysts highlighted Solana’s market cap ATH as a key factor. Moreover, the crypto trader pointed out a five-way decline since March’s highs, followed by a three-way move up. To the analyst, this suggests that Solana is “exhausted” as it’s starting to struggle. According to Bluntz, there’s a high chance that the highlighted performance will result in a “macro lower high.” Additionally, he forecasted SOL’s price to retrace below the $100 mark. Is Solana Poised For A Liftoff Or A Meltdown? Similarly, pseudonym analyst Credible issued a warning regarding SOL’s future. To the analyst, “coins like $SOL are just in larger distribution structures now.” However, Credible considers that BTC’s strength will relieve SOL as it initially “drags the whole market up.” The analyst agreed with Bluntz’s prediction, stating that it is “ultimately where we are headed,” but considers there’s a good chance Solana sees highs above March’s mark “before the real meltdown.” Nonetheless, some crypto analysts disagree with the gloomy forecast. DocXBT asserted he has “seen a lot of terrible Solana takes lately.” The analyst believes the token is “holding daily trends” and displays positive support and resistance levels. Moreover, he considers that investors should “stop overthinking it” unless “we lose daily trends” as the performance looks “supper clean.” Related Reading: Keeping Up With The Memecoins: Caitlyn Jenner’s New Token Surges 50,000% Amid Controversy On a similar note, CryptoJelle pointed out that SOL is “forming the post-breakout higher low.” To the analyst, Solana is following the same behavior it did during the February-March leg. Ultimately, Jelle suggests that the token could have found its bottom, and it’s currently getting ready for liftoff to a new ATH. The analyst forecasted a $600 price prediction for SOL this cycle.

However, it seems that the days of worry will soon be forgotten as one crypto analyst believes that the XRP price is about to break out of this accumulation zone. XRP Price To Break Out And Complete 1,200% Rally In an analysis posted on TradingView, crypto analyst Babenski has renewed XRP investors’ hope in the coin, predicting that it is about to break out of its drawn-out accumulation trend. According to the analyst, the altcoin is currently trying to break out of this accumulation, and could be successful this time around. Related Reading: Kickstarting The Bitcoin Bull Run: Expert Says $70,000 Is The Level To Beat The 7-year accumulation had began back in 2017 when the XRP Price had gone through a notable bull run. Naturally, this accumulation was expected to break in the next bull market which was in 2021. However, due to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) suing Ripple in 2020, it put a damper on the price, causing the XRP price to crash while others rallied. Since then, the altcoin has maintained its position inside the accumulation range, failing to break above $1 even after securing a partial victory over the regulator in 2023. This accumulation has now carried into 2024, but with a bull run expected this year, it could be time for XRP to shine. Babenski’s chart shows what could happen if the XRP Price were to break out of this accumulation. The crypto analyst sees a significant rally in the price, rising more than 1,200% to touch the $6. If this happens, the XRP Price would be securing a brand new all-time high. Other Analysts See The Same Trend Babenski is not the only crypto analyst who has predicted that the XRP price could be breaking out of its 7-year accumulation in 2024. Crypto analyst U-Copy has also pointed this out, taking to X (formerly Twitter), to share the analysis. Related Reading: Dogecoin Poised For 700% Explosion To $1.17 Amid Recovery In Major Metrics According to him, the XRP price is already close to the end of its triangle formation, which began in 2027. He revealed that the final gap was actually filled back at the $0.46 level, and with the price trading above $0.5 at the time of writing, a breakout could be imminent. Unlike Babenski, crypto analyst U-Copy did not give a price target for where they expect the XRP price to end up. However, the analyst does believe that something is bound to happen by December 2024. “Don’t know target price but Shit could blow up big in this Bull Cycle up to December,” U-Copy stated.

28603971,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=610285,1716940849,"Bullish Outlook: Target Price Of $90,000 For Bitcoin By Year’s End, According To Bernstein","Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency in the market, has experienced price volatility amid its struggle to consolidate above the crucial $70,000 resistance line. Recent reports of the collapsed Mt.Gox exchange processing payouts to its creditors have added to the cautious sentiment. However, wealth management firm Bernstein remains bullish, predicting significant growth in the Bitcoin ETF market and projecting higher price targets for BTC. In addition, The Birb Nest’s technical analysis reinforces market optimism, highlighting key support levels and indicating positive sentiment. Long-Term Bullish Outlook For Bitcoin Despite its recent inability to breach the $70,000 resistance level, Bitcoin remains well-positioned to surpass its all-time high of $73,700 reached on March 14. Wealth management firm Bernstein predicts substantial growth in the Bitcoin ETF market, estimating it to reach a remarkable $450 billion. Related Reading: Why The Bitcoin Halving Is Not Priced In And What’s Next: Expert The report also suggests that over $100 billion will flow into crypto ETFs within two years. Notably, these inflows into the ETF market are expected to be a significant price catalyst for BTC. The firm predicts a target price of $90,000 for Bitcoin by the end of this year and a projected cycle high of $150,000 in 2025. On the other hand, The Birb Nest, a trading firm, conducted a comprehensive technical analysis of the Bitcoin market and highlighted its share of bullish indicators for the Bitcoin price in the long run. Bullish Indicators Reinforce Market Optimism The analysis conducted by The Birb Nest shows that the 50-week and 200-week simple moving averages (SMAs) are at $43,950 and $35,358, respectively, reinforcing optimism in the market. In addition, the 7-week SPX correlation coefficient is currently at 0.36, which is a bullish sign for BTC. The 200-day Bitcoin Production Cost (BPRO) trend support is $62,580, while the 200-day SMA support is $53,516. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 59, indicating increased buying interest, although the 50-day Momentum is stalled at 49.

However, according to the firm, caution is advised to avoid potential overextensions. However, The Birb Nest notes that the Net Unrealized Profit and Loss (NUPL) indicator stands at 0.57, suggesting that a significant portion of the market is currently profitable, which could lead to increased selling pressure as investors capitalize on profits. Currently, BTC is trading at $67,900, down 3% from Monday’s price and over 3% in the past seven days, showing the cryptocurrency’s struggle to break above higher resistance levels, which are located at $69,500 and $70,000 on the BTC/USD daily chart. Conversely, bulls must hold the next support levels for BTC at $67,000, $66,500, and $63,800 to avoid a potential loss of the cryptocurrency’s key $60,000 milestone.
