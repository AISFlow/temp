Mikhail Abyzov, who was appointed Minister for Open Government in 2012, made the remarks during an interview with Russian-language news source RIA this week. However, during the talk, he said that he believes ""a decision will be made soon"" matter – if only out of necessity due to the technology's growth.  In the interview, he went on promote a ""thoughtful"" approach to regulation, stating:  ""It is necessary to move from a policy of denial and prohibition to a very accurate, thoughtful state regulation of the turnover of crypto-currencies. I think we should officially recognize them as a financial tool and properly handle it carefully so that excessive pressure does not destroy the technology itself.""  Abyzov, who previously led E4, one of Russia's largest engineering firms, went on to argue that development around the tech should be supported, whether it involves the development of cryptocurrency or other applications of blockchain.  ""I think that the Russian technology sector has such a potential. It will be implemented in the format of creating a cryptor, or other new technologies of the financial or non-financial sector – it is difficult to predict. But it is necessary to support and develop such initiatives,"" he told the publication.  Overall, Abyzov is the latest senior official from the Russian government to openly support a more accommodative environment for cryptocurrency trading activity. Last week, Anton Siluanov, Russia's finance minister, said that there is ""no point"" in prohibiting cryptocurrencies in the country.

The US central bank branch is co-organizing the event, which will be held on September 28–29 with the Journal of Economics and Business. The segment on blockchain and cryptocurrencies is scheduled for the latter part of the first day, beginning with a session on ""Bitcoin, Blockchain, and Cryptocurrencies"" that will feature Jim Cunha, senior vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, and William Nelson, executive managing director of The Clearing House.  Of note is that blockchain's impact on financial stability is a subject that has been raised by other central banks in the past, including by representatives to the Financial Stability Board (FSB), which counts a number of central bank leaders among its membership.  Still, in the introduction to the event's agenda, the question of what that impact might entail is acknowledged as an open one.  The Philly Fed wrote:  ""...blockchain technology, which was initially used for bitcoin transactions, also has the potential to create a major disruption in the financial landscape. Moreover, many countries (including Sweden, Korea, and China) have explored their own digital currencies. It remains unclear whether this sector will continue to grow (since it has not yet gone through the entire economic cycle) and what impact it will have on monetary policy and financial stability overall.""  The event is set to include presentations on four research papers, covering topics such as ""The Law of One Bitcoin Price?"" and ""Blockchain Disruption and Smart Contracts,"" among others.

42427762,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3cth,1505331018,1.6 Million Attacks: Kaspersky Reveals Data on Crypto Mining Malware,"More than 1.65 million computers were targeted by cryptocurrency mining malware attacks in the first eight months of 2017, according to a new report from Kaspersky Lab.  The Russia-based cybersecurity outfit said on Tuesday that the figure represents the number of computers, running Kaspersky software, that were protected from the malicious software, which can turn a machine into a remotely-controlled mining device without the owner actually knowing.  The total for 2017 thus far seems on pace to exceed the number of attacks detected in 2016, which totaled 1.8 million. By comparison, Kaspersky detected just over 700,000 mining malware attacks in 2014.  Partially underpinning the incidents, the company said, are several large-scale botnets dedicated to malicious mining activities.  The report said:  ""This results in threat actors receiving cryptocurrency, while their victims’ computer systems experience a dramatic slowdown. Over the last month alone, we have detected several large botnets designed to profit from concealed crypto mining.""  The company only released the number of its own clients protected, and did not clarify how many machines they thought were infected globally, or if any of their customers were infected despite their protection.  Cryptocurrency mining botnets are nothing new. One of the newer botnets discovered in 2017 was developed out of a US National Security Agency exploit leaked by a group of hackers referred to as the Shadow Brokers.  Though miners traditionally infected Windows computers, they can also impact Linux machines. Some botnets infect machines which do not possess sufficient processing power to effectively mine for anything as well.

42427766,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3czh,1505326817,Dubai Financial Regulator Issues Warning on ICOs,"A financial services regulator in Dubai has issued a warning on initial coin offerings (ICOs).  In a new statement today, the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) became the latest markets regulator to urge caution to prospective investors, a list which include agencies from Russia, Canada and the US, among others.  One notable difference is that the DFSA said that it ""does not currently regulate these types of product offerings"" or give licenses to firms within the Dubai International Financial Centre – a special economic zone within Dubai that the DFSA oversees – that offer such products or services.  The agency said:  ""The DFSA wishes to highlight that these types of product offerings, and the systems and technology that support them, are complex. They have their own unique risks, which may not be easy to identify or understand; such risks may increase where offerings are made on a cross-border basis. These offerings should be regarded as high-risk investments.""  For now, it's unclear whether the DFSA will take additional steps to regulate any kind of related activity within the economic zone.  As it stands, its statements only focus on the risk to investors, and do not offer any insight into whether the agency believes ICO tokens may be securities, a finding which would put its guidance in line with other regulators internationally.

42427763,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3cvh,1505321413,AXA Is Using Ethereum's Blockchain for a New Flight Insurance Product,"French insurance giant AXA has launched a new flight delay insurance product that uses the public ethereum blockchain to store and process payouts.  The product, called Fizzy, is being pitched as a ""smart insurance"" tool that flyers can use to insure their trips if their flight is delayed by two hours or more. As such, the product makes notable use of smart contracts, self-executing piece of code that triggers once certain conditions are met on a blockchain.  According to AXA, ethereum's public blockchain plays two key roles here. It maintains an accessible record of the insurance contract itself within a smart contract, and serves as a mechanism for triggering the payment to the client once the two-hour mark is passed.  AXA representative Jean-Baptiste Mounier told CoinDesk in an email:  ""The smart contract is the party that decides whether or not we should indemnify the policy holder and triggers a payment request to our system. The use of a smart contract to trigger claims will add trust in the insurer / policy holder relationship.""  Ultimately, AXA is positioning the product release as a way to build more transparency into the insurance process.  ""Building customer-oriented offers is our definite goal at AXA. By removing insurance exclusions and using an Ethereum smart contract to trigger indemnifications, we increase the level of trust our customers can have with AXA,"" he said.  Looking ahead, AXA is weighing additional uses of the ethereum blockchain for the Fizzy offering.  For now, insurance payouts from Fizzy are being made in government-issued currencies to the customer. However, AXA said that, in the future, it wants to denominate those payments in ether, the cryptocurrency of the ethereum network.  ""In the future, we want to include payment and indemnification in ether, which will completely guarantee coded trust in the fact that indemnification will for sure take place (and the insurer will not be able to trick consumers, which is a fear some customers have),"" Mounier explained.

42427769,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3d5h,1505318378,"Better, Faster zk-SNARKs: Zcash Developers Release New Privacy Tech","Researchers working on the zcash protocol announced today they've invented a new way to speed up the anonymous cryptocurrency.  Today, zcash, the seventeenth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, uses the bleeding-edge cryptographic technique zk-SNARKs to hide balances and user addresses, but the technique comes with a drawback that's hard to ignore: anonymous transactions are sluggish.  While normal transactions take seconds to create, shielded transactions using zk-SNARKs take one to two minutes. That's why engineers have been exploring ways to cut down the time needed to securely generate shielded transactions.  And now, those efforts appear to be bearing fruit.  Zcash engineer Sean Bowe and cryptographers Matthew Green and Ian Miers (all of whom also work for the for-profit Zcash Company) are releasing a living prototype of a new form of zk-SNARK that could lead to huge improvements in speed.  Meet 'Jubjub'  Called Jubjub, the new type of elliptic curve uses math to slash the time needed to create a transaction.  With the technology, Bowe explains in the announcement blog post, the researchers are claiming ""record-breaking performance."" According to the post, generating zk-SNARKs transactions will now be roughly five times faster while requiring 98 times less computer memory.  The post explains:  ""Fast elliptic-curve cryptography in this context allows us to use more efficient primitives for commitment schemes and collision-resistant hashes.""  One advantage of the tech is that it makes possible zcash transactions on a smartphone, which was infeasible before.  Zcash will be rolling out the technology in an upcoming upgrade, Sapling, expected sometime in 2018. The change is scheduled to occur as a hard fork, meaning all users and miners will need to upgrade their software to take advantage of it.  The researchers, though, have also open-sourced the technology so anyone can take advantage of it in their own projects.  Zcash Company user education and community team lead Paige Peterson told CoinDesk:  ""Consequently, other projects and companies — both within the cryptocurrency and blockchain world and outside of it — will be able to use these techniques.""  Elsewhere in the blockchain world, ethereum's next major upgrade, Metropolis, is already paving the way for zk-SNARKs.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership in the Zcash Company, developer of zcash.

15990218,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/types-cryptocurrency-wallets-explained,1505318283,Types Of Cryptocurrency Wallets Explained,"If you invest in cryptocurrencies, it is beneficial to store them in a wallet. This will help to protect your investment; however, knowing which wallet to choose can be somewhat confusing. For more basic information regarding what a cryptocurrency wallet is, and how it works, please see our other guides, where we go into more detail. For now, we will be focusing on what types of wallets are available to you, how they differ, and which one is right for you. Before we take a look at the different types of cryptocurrency wallets, and the advantages and disadvantages of them, we will just run through a few additional wallets, as background information, which will then help you when we come onto the different types of wallets available to you. Cryptocurrency Wallet Categories Hot and Cold Wallets: Quite simply, a hot or cold wallet refers to whether the wallet is connected to the internet or not. Hot wallets are connected to the internet, and because of this, poses more risks, and are seen to be less secure; however, they are more user friendly. On the contrary, cold wallets are not connected to the internet, and are wallets that are stored offline. This comes with a lot less risk and have improved security; however, they are best compared to a vault or a safe, where you would store larger sums of money, as opposed to a wallet that you would carry around with you on a day to day basis for simple transactions. For day to day transactions, you are much more likely to use hot wallets, as opposed to cold wallets, and cold wallets for more long-term holdings. Multisig Wallets: Multisignature wallets, which are more fondly known in the field as multisig wallets, and as the name suggests, they require more than one signature in order to complete the given transaction. This is considered to be an additional security feature, as you will not be able to access the account without all of the signatures. You should consider a multisig wallet to be much like a shared bank account, where no transactions can be made unless all of the parties have entered their PIN, or signed for a withdrawal. This is exactly the same context for the Bitcoin wallet, and is therefore ideal for families and businesses. Multicurrency Wallets: Multicurrency wallets are fairly self-explanatory, and simply allow you to hold and store more than one crypto currency. These are great if you have several different coins, as you do not have to have multiple wallets, and can instead store them all in one place. Some multicurrency wallets have added features that will allow you to convert one cryptocurrency into another; for example, if you have existing Bitcoins that you want to convert into Ether, you can with some multicurrency wallets. However; not all wallets will offer this feature, so if this is something that you are wanting, it is important to research the different wallets in order to make this easier. If you have already picked one though, and wish to convert some coins into a different currency, this is still possible, but it requires additional steps which you will have to complete online. Public and Private Keys: All cryptocurrency is represented by an entry in the blockchain, which is associated to a public key; but, in order for you to move your cryptocurrency around, whether that is to exchange it, or to convert it to another currency, you will require your private key to unlock it. You will usually find your private key in your crypto wallet. One thing that is worth bearing in mind is that your private key is the only way in which you can access your funds, and if you lose this, all of your cryptocurrency is lost. Some private keys are kept offline, to prevent them from getting hacked, so it is important that you carry out research and make an informed decision as to where you wish to store your key when you choose your wallet. Different Types Of Cryptocurrency Wallets Online Wallet An online wallet is sometimes referred to as a Web Wallet, and is one that you access via your web browser. This should not be confused with hot wallets, which, although they are online, does not refer to all online wallets. Online wallets also refer to mobile and desktop wallets, and are any that you access via an internet connection. The same applies with hot wallets though, and online wallets should not be used to store large amounts of currency in, as they are more at risk of becoming hacked. To help you decide whether an online wallet is for you or not, we have highlighted a few of the advantages and disadvantages… Advantages: You can complete your transactions very quickly. This is because you have instant access to your wallet. Some have the ability to store and manage a range of different currencies and allow different transfers between them. Online wallets also allow your currency to be directly integrated into an exchange. If you only have small amounts invested in cryptocurrencies, online accounts are ideal. You can use a TOR network for added Privacy A TOR network is a well-known and trusted anonymity network. You do not have to install any software on your PC, as it is all stored online. One of the biggest advantages is that they are so accessible. There are often mobile apps that you can download onto your phone that will allow you to access your cryptocurrency wallet on the move. Disadvantages: It is not a good idea to store large amounts of money in an online wallet, so if you are looking for a long-term place to store a high investment in, online wallets are not ideal and should be avoided. You are more at risk of being hacked and are susceptible to phishing scams, malware, DDOS attacks and outdated security measures. There are a lot of risks associated with doing anything online, as it leaves your computer completely open to viruses, which can affect your wallet. You can reduce this risk keeping your software up to date, and not using internet café’s etc – the usual things you would do to help keep any financial transactions secure. Take advantage of two step authentication, and always enable it if it is available to you. You do not have control of your wallet. Because it is online, it is effectively stored on a third party, which does not come without it’s risks. Mobile Wallets: As the name suggests, mobile wallets can be used on a mobile device, and allows you to access your wallet on the move. One of the great things about mobile wallets is that they can often provide more features than wallets that are purely internet based. That is not to say that they do not come without risks. Advantages: They are among the easiest of the wallets to use, and much more practical. They can be used on the go, which is great if you are regularly making transactions. Just like the online wallets, you can use a TOR network, which will help increase anonymity and security. Many mobile wallets will offer additional features that simply are not available with other wallets, such as QR code scanning. Disadvantages: Mobile phones are not at all secure, and there is nothing that will save your savings if your phone becomes maliciously compromised. It is wide open to malware and viruses, which can completely wipe out any cryptocurrencies that you have saved. Desktop Wallets: Desktop wallets are among the more secure cryptocurrency wallets; however, this does depend on how committed you are on keeping up to date with the latest online security measures. Any laptop or computer; however old or young that has once been connected to the internet, even if it is not connected now, will come with a certain amount of risk, unless of course you completely clean the system, and install a new system on it. If you have a laptop that is completely clean – that is, it has never been connected to the internet, it can be used as a great cold storage method; which, if you remember from earlier is favoured to store large amounts of investment. The great thing about desktop wallets is that a lot of people have old laptops lying around, which are not being used for anything, which are ideal for desktop wallets. Advantages: It is associated with less risk, especially if the computer has never been connected to the internet. It is the ideal cold wallet to use if you are looking to store a large amount of currency somewhere. You are not relying on your private key to be stored on a third-party server, again, reducing the chances of your account being hacked and your money stolen. Desktop wallets are incredibly easy to use, unlike some. A TOR network can be used which will give you more anonymity and privacy. Disadvantages: If your computer is connected to the internet, your privacy and security are at greater risk. Because everything is held offline, if anything happens to your computer, and you are unable to fix it, you could lose all of your investment. You have to regularly back up your computer for the same reason as above. Regardless of whether you are connected to the internet, and despite the fact that a desktop wallet is considered a lower risk choice, your computer is still open to viruses and malware, which result in you losing all of your coins; which is not good if you are using this as a cold wallet to store larger amounts. Hardware Wallet: Hardware wallets are a bit of a mixed drawer in terms of popularity, and along with it come many benefits and drawbacks. They are marginally less user friendly than desktop wallets and web wallets; however, they are more secure than hot wallets, and easier to work with than paper wallets (see below). Hardware wallets come in a number of different forms, so it is important that research is carried out into your chosen hardware wallet prior to placing any of your money in there. They are; however, great for storing large amounts of cryptocurrency, so long as you do not want to move it around often. They also offer great amounts of control. Advantages: Some hardware wallets come with a screen, making them one of the most secure ways to store your cryptocurrency in the long-term. Even without, in general, hardware wallets offer greater security than many others. Disadvantages: They are often quite difficult for beginners to use; however, if you have large amounts to invest, it really is the best one. However; because of this reason, hardware wallets are often sold out. Paper Wallets: Finally, we are going to take a look at paper wallets. These used to be very popular for cold storage; however, since hardware wallets have come onto the scene, they are significantly less so. That said, paper wallets are notoriously secure, so long as you undertake very strict security precautions when initially setting these wallets up. A paper wallet is simply a document that contains all of the necessary data needed to generate Bitcoin private keys. This document can store a number of different keys; however, it allows you to keep a physical document containing this information. Advantages: They are one of the most secure choices of wallet, and are virtually hacker proof. They are not stored on a computer, which would mean someone would have to physically break into your home to gather the information required to steal your money. You do not have to worry about your private keys being stored on a third-party server, because they are on a physical document in your home. Disadvantage: You need to have a greater understanding of how wallets work Requires more effort if you wish to move your cryptocurrencies around. So, which cryptocurrency wallet is best? Deciding which wallet to use really is a personal choice. It is dependent on a number of questions, which you need to answer prior to choosing your wallet. These include; whether you need to access your wallet every day, or is it for a more long-term use? Do you wish to use several currencies, or just one? Will you need to access your wallet on the move? Once you have answered all of these, you can go about deciding which of the above wallets would be best suited to you and your needs. Just remember that regardless of which wallet you choose, to keep it as secure as you possible can, you should be backing up your wallet regularly, ensuring you are using the most up to date software, and include as many security features as you can.

If you have a laptop that is completely clean – that is, it has never been connected to the internet, it can be used as a great cold storage method; which, if you remember from earlier is favoured to store large amounts of investment. The great thing about desktop wallets is that a lot of people have old laptops lying around, which are not being used for anything, which are ideal for desktop wallets. Advantages: It is associated with less risk, especially if the computer has never been connected to the internet. It is the ideal cold wallet to use if you are looking to store a large amount of currency somewhere. You are not relying on your private key to be stored on a third-party server, again, reducing the chances of your account being hacked and your money stolen. Desktop wallets are incredibly easy to use, unlike some. A TOR network can be used which will give you more anonymity and privacy. Disadvantages: If your computer is connected to the internet, your privacy and security are at greater risk. Because everything is held offline, if anything happens to your computer, and you are unable to fix it, you could lose all of your investment. You have to regularly back up your computer for the same reason as above. Regardless of whether you are connected to the internet, and despite the fact that a desktop wallet is considered a lower risk choice, your computer is still open to viruses and malware, which result in you losing all of your coins; which is not good if you are using this as a cold wallet to store larger amounts. Hardware Wallet: Hardware wallets are a bit of a mixed drawer in terms of popularity, and along with it come many benefits and drawbacks. They are marginally less user friendly than desktop wallets and web wallets; however, they are more secure than hot wallets, and easier to work with than paper wallets (see below). Hardware wallets come in a number of different forms, so it is important that research is carried out into your chosen hardware wallet prior to placing any of your money in there. They are; however, great for storing large amounts of cryptocurrency, so long as you do not want to move it around often. They also offer great amounts of control. Advantages: Some hardware wallets come with a screen, making them one of the most secure ways to store your cryptocurrency in the long-term. Even without, in general, hardware wallets offer greater security than many others. Disadvantages: They are often quite difficult for beginners to use; however, if you have large amounts to invest, it really is the best one. However; because of this reason, hardware wallets are often sold out. Paper Wallets: Finally, we are going to take a look at paper wallets. These used to be very popular for cold storage; however, since hardware wallets have come onto the scene, they are significantly less so. That said, paper wallets are notoriously secure, so long as you undertake very strict security precautions when initially setting these wallets up. A paper wallet is simply a document that contains all of the necessary data needed to generate Bitcoin private keys. This document can store a number of different keys; however, it allows you to keep a physical document containing this information. Advantages: They are one of the most secure choices of wallet, and are virtually hacker proof. They are not stored on a computer, which would mean someone would have to physically break into your home to gather the information required to steal your money. You do not have to worry about your private keys being stored on a third-party server, because they are on a physical document in your home. Disadvantage: You need to have a greater understanding of how wallets work Requires more effort if you wish to move your cryptocurrencies around. So, which cryptocurrency wallet is best? Deciding which wallet to use really is a personal choice. It is dependent on a number of questions, which you need to answer prior to choosing your wallet. These include; whether you need to access your wallet every day, or is it for a more long-term use? Do you wish to use several currencies, or just one? Will you need to access your wallet on the move? Once you have answered all of these, you can go about deciding which of the above wallets would be best suited to you and your needs. Just remember that regardless of which wallet you choose, to keep it as secure as you possible can, you should be backing up your wallet regularly, ensuring you are using the most up to date software, and include as many security features as you can.

In a statement released today, China's National Internet Finance Association (NIFA) asserted that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have become a tool for speculation among investors, while also serving as a payment conduit for illegal fundraising and money laundering. Although a self-regulatory organization and not a regulatory agency itself, NIFA was first initiated in 2015 by the People's Bank of China and approved by the State Council.  The release comes just under two weeks after NIFA published a warning on initial coin offerings, or ICOs, which itself was followed by a ban on the funding model by Chinese regulators. Exchanges and other services focused on ICOs have since moved to halt operations or shut down entirely in the wake of that decision.  Of note is the comment that trading platforms for cryptocurrencies in China are not legally sanctioned, with the organization stating:  ""Any trading platform for any kind of so-called 'coin' has no legal base of foundation in China.""  The notice came days after reports emerged that China's regulators are reportedly moving toward new restrictions on the country's cryptocurrency exchanges. Thus far, however, no official announcement has been seen from either the People's Bank of China or other agencies within the government.  Major exchanges in China, including Huobi, BTCC and OKCoin, still continue operating, while others are exiting the market citing the regulatory concerns.

42422907,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0qz1h,1505314824,Indian Central Bank Studies 'Fiat Cryptocurrency' for Digital Rupee,"The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the country's central bank, has spoken about its ongoing cryptocurrency research, hinting at its role in a future digital alternative to the rupee.  With the Indian government currently trying to move toward a fully digital economy, it has initiated the flagship Digital India initiative and research programs to drive that process forward.  As reported by CoinDesk, a paper from the RBI's research institute, published in January, argued that blockchain tech could provide the necessary basis for the digitization of the rupee.  Now, according to the The Economic Times, RBI executive director Sudarshan Sen has indicated that this work is still in progress, saying at an Indian fintech conference today:  ""Right now, we have a group of people who are looking at fiat cryptocurrencies. Something that is an alternative to the Indian rupee, so to speak. We are looking at that closely.""  However, the bank is less keen on non-central bank cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, with Sen stating that the RBI is ""not comfortable"" with such ""private"" cryptocurrencies.  The RBI has previously issued investor warnings on the risks of cryptocurrencies, and its deputy governor claimed their potential is ""being overstated"" in a March speech.

42427770,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3d9h,1505311159,"Correction Not a Crash: Bitcoin Price Eyes $3,000 as Traders Take Profits","The bitcoin-US dollar exchange rate fell below $4,000 on Tuesday, extending losses in the overnight trade to hit a three-week low of $3,781.  At press time, the cryptocurrency is trading at $3,844 levels, which amounts to a 25% drop from the record high of $5,000 on September 2. Perhaps more notably, month-on-month, BTC is now trading dead flat for the first time in since June.  Rumor has it bitcoin is feeling the pinch of speculation that the Chinese government is launching a crackdown on exchanges. A few others are blaming JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon's scathing attack on bitcoin for the meltdown in the prices seen today.  But, while these events could factors, neither explain the current market activity.  News that China is planning to ban exchange trading has been in the air since Friday. Following a drop to $4,000 over the weekend, BTC regained poise as Chinese government kept mum on the issue. Experts dismissed the idea that an exchange ban would be long run negative for bitcoin as over-the-counter market will continue to flourish. Thus, bitcoin regained bid and moved to $4,350-4,380 levels in the first two days of the week.  Meanwhile, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon's negative comments on bitcoin are hardly surprising.  Investment banks have always been critical of the cyrptocurrencies. Moreover, JP Morgan is not a crypto bigwig, thus Dimon's comments are a big hit across the wires, but would hardly matter to bitcoin traders.  Euphoria not reached  As we analyze the current markets, it’s important to remember bull markets are built on fear and skepticism, while major market tops are the product of extreme euphoria.  Most investment banks have been and still call bitcoin a ""scam."" Every week, we see some stock market expert drawing parallels between the bitcoin rally and stock market bubbles seen over the last 100 years. Thus, despite the 416% year-to-date gains in bitcoin, it is safe to say that there are no signs of Euphoria.  In fact, the first sign of bitcoin nearing a major top would be investment banks boarding the cryptocurrency freight train.  More likely then is that what we’re seeing now is a technical pull back. Following a stupendous rally, investors are looking for reasons to take profit.  Technical Outlook: Watch $3,000  Daily chart  The chart above shows a bearish price RSI divergence on September 2 has been followed by:  Symmetrical triangle breakdown  Head and shoulders breakdown  The symmetrical triangle, which can also be referred to as a coil, usually forms during a trend as a continuation pattern. The pattern contains at least two lower highs and two higher lows.  The ""head and shoulders"" is a reversal pattern that, when formed, signals an asset (in this case bitcoin) is likely to move against the previous trend. The H&S neckline (line drawn from the left shoulder bottom and right shoulder bottom) support has been breached.  A break below the neckline level has confirmed bullish-to-bearish trend reversal.  Scope for a drop to $3,000: The H&S breakdown has opened doors for a sell-off to $3,000, which is the target as per the measured height method (difference between head and shoulder peak ($5,000) and neckline support ($4,000) is subtracted from the neckline support).  Corrective rally to be capped around $4,150 levels  4-hour chart  The stochastic and the RSI are oversold, which is a condition in which the price of an underlying asset has fallen sharply due to market overreaction or panic selling. It is usually followed by a corrective rally.  Thus, a brief correction to $4,150 (former neckline support will now act as a resistance) could be seen.  Only a break above $4,400 (resistance offered by the trend line drawn from September 2 high and September 8 high) would revive the bullish view.

42427765,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3cxh,1505304003,Herd on the Street? Bank of America Survey Calls Bitcoin 'Most Crowded Trade',"Buying bitcoin is now the most crowded trade in the financial markets.  According to a recent Bank of America survey, 26 percent of 181 fund managers polled (who oversee a combined $629 billion in assets) cited bitcoin as the most crowded trade. The second most popular choice for the distinction was going long on the Nasdaq composite index, picked by 22 percent of respondents, followed by shorting the dollar, cited by 21 percent.  Notably, it was the first time the cryptocurrency has appeared on the list.  The upshot of the news is that, with so many investors having piled into the market, it could portend an eventual stampede to sell.  The Office of Financial Research, a bureau of the U.S. Treasury created after the 2008 financial crisis, defines a crowded trade as ""a trade in which the market participants have large and similar positions, creating the risk that there will be insufficient liquidity should market participants seek to unwind their positions simultaneously.""  ""Such concentration creates fragility in the financial system,"" the office said in a report published in 2012, back when few if any institutional investors had probably even heard of bitcoin.  That said, the market conditions may be having short-term benefits. Bitcoin has roughly quadrupled in value since the beginning of this year. At press time, its price was down over 7 percent for the day at $3,843, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.

Intel has been pursuing blockchain technology for some time, with a particular emphasis on its own hardware-based security. As reported by CoinDesk, the firm uses so-called ""software guard extensions"" (SGXs) to create secure enclaves within its processors to protect vital data.  Tencent, which notably developed the WeChat messaging app, also has a history with blockchain technology.

42427756,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3cdh,1505293215,Corda 1.0: R3 Sets Target Date for Production Distributed Ledger Tech,"Distributed ledger consortium R3 will soon launch the first production version of its Corda platform.  After two years of development, the group of over 100 banks, regulators and technology firms now says it has crossed the final milestone, and that it plans to upgrade the software to enable live transactions by the end of this year. Launched in beta in 2016, the distributed ledger solution has already underpinned several notable tests, including an effort by financial giant Mizuho Group to digitize letters of credit.  But while the details around the launch are being kept private for now, Corda product lead Mike Ward said the decision to introduce Corda 1.0 was reached at a monthly engineering call on Thursday.  Ward told CoinDesk:  ""A lot of what I think the engineers are excited to talk about is what happens post 1.0. What are the things that are on the horizon long term?""  Yet, until the launch of Corda 1.0, developers face a daunting task: every time R3 releases an upgrade, users have to rebuild and retest some of their own work, thus limiting the scale of projects capable of being created. After the launch however, the developer API is expected to be stable enough that enterprise-grade products can finally be constructed without the worry of rebuilds after future upgrades.  As a result, Ward expects the launch will trigger a new phase of development in which consortium members discover unexpected ways of using a shared, distributed ledger to save money and generate new sources of revenue.  Ward explained the importance of the new platform: “It allows people to have a firm foundation to go build on.""  Corda's next phase  That firm foundation and R3's future trajectory were distilled for attendees at the consortium's annual CordaCon conference in London yesterday.  But for those unable to attend, Ward touched on the progress being made by several key R3 partners. For example, Intel is continuing its work to provide hardware-based protection for member transactions, while Microsoft is using its Azure cloud computing platform to accelerate development through Project Coco.  Of particular note, however, were Ward's comments on R3's ""body of work"" with Tibco, a software analytics firm based in Palo Alto, California, to connect these two ideas – local hardware and cloud storage.  According to Ward, R3 and Tibco are working together to create a ""hybrid bridge"" between Microsoft Azure and a user's local hardware. Going forward, he said the partnership will include ways to use Tibco's software to cull analytics from Corda distributed ledger transactions.  Ward also elaborated on early stage work, which was discussed at the event by R3 software engineer Andrius Dagys, to help Corda users sort through settlement algorithms that have been academically vetted, but not tested in rigorous live use cases.  Ward concluded:  ""We’ll provide you with a variety of choices, but which one you choose should be based just on the discussions that we all love to have in user groups, around the notions of the algorithms – have they actually been used, have they been field tested?""

Wesley Bricker, who has served as the regulator's top accountant since last year, spoke on September 11 before the AICPA National Conference on Banks & Savings Institutions, held in Washington, DC. His speech, published by the SEC, covers a range of areas but notably concluded with an aside on ICOs.  After touching on some of the elements of the SEC's statement on the subject in July – during which time the agency said federal securities laws may apply to some ICOs – Bricker raised a series of questions both issuers and holders of ICOs should consider for financial reporting.  For issuers, questions included:  Are there liabilities requiring recognition or disclosure?  Are there implications for the provision for income taxes?  Are there previously recognized assets that require de-recognition?  Are there revenues or expenses requiring recognition or deferral?  Is there a transaction with owners, resulting in debt or equity classification and possibly compensation expense?  What are the necessary financial statement filing requirements?  Likewise, he advised investors and token owners to ask:  Does specialized accounting guidance (such as for investment companies) apply to the holder’s financial statement presentation?  What are the characteristics of the coin or token in considering whether, how, and at what value, the transaction should affect the holder's financial statements?  What is the nature of the holder's involvement in considering whether the issuer's activities should be consolidated or accounted for under the equity method?  Bricker ultimately cautioned that these are only ""illustrative questions"" and that, in a refrain from the previous SEC statement, the specifics of the ICO itself would determine what reporting requirements must be met.  ""An entity involved in initial coin or token offering activities will need to consider the necessary accounting, disclosure and reporting guidance based on the nature of its involvement,"" he told attendees.

The average price of bitcoin across global exchanges fell below $4,000 at roughly 3:15 UTC today, hitting a low not observed since September 10. The movement followed a period in which the bitcoin price repeatedly tested $4,000, but succeeded in staying above the barrier.  All in all, the move comes during an uncertain time for the cryptocurrency market, which has seen a period of sideways trading following a torrid first half in 2017.  With the recent decline, the price of bitcoin is up just 1.7 percent over the last month, though it has still appreciated nearly 300% this year. Likewise, the broader cryptocurrency markets have seen similar activity, rising 3.4% over the last 30 days, but declining more than 17 percent from its highest point during the period, according to CoinMarketCap.  As for the current sentiment, continued rumors that China could move to close domestic order-book exchanges have no doubt concerned more casual investors (while providing opportunities for profit-taking from long-term bulls).  Fanning the flames have been statements from notable community figures that appear to attest to the accuracy of the claims, though details on the primary sources for that information have not been forthcoming.
