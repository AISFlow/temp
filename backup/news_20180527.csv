42380715,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zCCr,1527418207,ZombieChain Comes Alive: Can Ethereum Sidechains Save the Dapps?,"That decision will cost you half a cent. Are you surethat's the right move?  If you're a gamer, decentralized applications (dapps) hold an enticing promise: you might finally be able to truly own virtual in-game items and accumulate them without worrying about a company changing the rules and taking them away. But as with other big blockchain ideas, that's not quite a reality today.  One reason is the economics of how this would work are uncertain. To commit an action to the ethereum blockchain, users need to expend gas, a unit of value that's priced in ether, the network's cryptocurrency, and that fluctuates based on how much other people are using the network at any given time.  For Loom Network, a startup specializing in applying blockchain technology to gaming dapps, that just won't do. Constant microtransactions harm user experience, even if network traffic isn't pushing up gas prices at a given moment, as happened during the recent CryptoKitties boom.  Loom co-founder James Duffy told CoinDesk in a recent interview, ""there's just a mental transaction cost.""  He continued:  ""Even if you're spending a fraction of a penny every time you move your character, people still have to make decisions about whether it's worthwhile to make a move [when] they know every single thing they're doing is costing them.""  With that problem in mind, Duffy announced Loom's newest offering – a ready-made ""shared sidechain"" that dapp developers can use in exchange for a monthly fee – this week. ZombieChain, as it's called, is expected to launch in a month or two.  So far, no developers have signed up to build dapps on it, but the Loom team is excited about how it advances their ideas and vision.  ""ZombieChain's model more closely parallels traditional web hosting,"" Duffy wrote in the announcement, ""where developers pay a flat monthly fee based on the resources consumed by their application, upgrading their web server and paying more as their app grows in popularity over time.""  The idea of a shared sidechain, Duffy believes, has the potential to help gaming dapps achieve scale while making life easier for users and developers alike.  The alternatives, as they stand today, are: one, to house games on ethereum's main chain, with its poor user experience; or two, to build a dedicated sidechain for each game.  ""Not everyone wants to do that,"" Duffy told CoinDesk – hence ZombieChain has come to life.  Sidestepping scalability  Broadly, sidechains have a long pedigree in cryptocurrencies, going back to Adam Back and other developers' 2014 proposal for bitcoin ""pegged sidechains.""  The idea is to complete transactions on smaller, nimbler chains that are later reconciled to the main blockchain – ethereum, in Loom's case. Sidechain users sacrifice some of the security and decentralization of the main chain, since they depend on a smaller number of ""validators"" – analogous to miners – to register their transactions.  But they gain in terms of throughput, that is, the time it takes to complete transactions.  Loom Network took this idea and introduced the concept of ""application-specific sidechains"" or ""dappchains."" Using Loom's software development kit (SDK), developers can build a dedicated sidechain to house their dapp, with ethereum serving as a secure, decentralized base layer.  Loom has already built DelegateCall, a kind of decentralized Stack Exchange, on a dappchain. In addition, two games are under development in-house, according to Duffy: one he compares to Magic: the Gathering, the other to Pokemon. The user experience, he says, is like any mobile game: ""fully immersive, graphics – you actually wouldn't really know that it's running on a dappchain.""  As the company's head of business development Michael Cullinan told CoinDesk in March, the Loom developer platform aims ""to make it simple to make highly-scalable apps on the blockchain.""  However, the company's since found that not every project wants its own dappchain – at least not in the beginning. Developers would have to set up validators to act as the nexus between the sidechain and the ethereum blockchain. Then, in order to achieve decentralization, they would have to incentivize users – if they had users – to act as validators themselves.  Many early-stage projects were looking for a simpler solution, so Loom came up with the idea of a shared dappchain. Duffy told CoinDesk: ""this way, when someone launches a new application they don't know how popular it's going to be, so they can start on kind of a shared hosting plan.""  If the game does take off, the developers can ""fork it and run it on its own dappchain."" Eventually, Duffy says, Loom may roll out multiple shared chains for different use cases: a games chain and a social media chain, for example.  The monthly fees the developers pay will depend on the cost of committing their users' data to ethereum. How developers collect money from users is up to them: donations are one possibility, as are monthly charges through a smart contract.  Reckoning with the trilemma  Designing decentralized networks involves tradeoffs, and sidechains are no exception. Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin described these tradeoffs as a trilemma, in which three different priorities are in tension: decentralization, security, and scalability.  Duffy recognizes this fact, and argues that ZombieChain is a kind of ""middle ground.""  First, it's important to note that Loom Network's focus is on applications that need high levels of throughput: decentralized games and social networks. And Duffy argues that these use cases ""don't really need that high level of decentralization that you need on ethereum.""  On a decentralized social network, he says:  ""Someone's not going to pay millions of dollars to attack the network to censor someone else's tweet.""  For that reason, Loom Network has opted to base its sidechains – including ZombieChain – on delegated proof of stake (DPoS), a consensus algorithm in which the network elects ""validators"" to serve in place of miners. How many validators is up to the developer: the higher the number, the slower – but more decentralized – the network.  As for the shared ZombieChain, Duffy says the number of validators hasn't been decided. He notes, though, that ""in the beginning, it's fully centralized because we're running all the validators. Then in the future we want to open it up to let other people run validators.""  To be clear, that's the case with any new sidechain: until a user base develops, and some of those users are willing to serve as validators, the chain is centralized in the hands of its creator.  Down the line, therefore, ZombieChain can actually help to ensure that new projects are to some degree decentralized and scalable from the outset. Rather than setting up on the slow and costly ethereum mainnet, or spinning up a new centralized dappchain, they can join ZombieChain.  Even projects that are already set up on mainnet, says Duffy, ""could very easily port that same application to ZombieChain,"" adding:  ""It would reduce the cost significantly and also let them have a more fluid user experience.""  As for the third leg of the trilemma, security, Duffy does not appear to be worried. ""It's really important to have that decentralized base layer of ethereum,"" he says, ""because then you can use it like the high court.  The mechanism for doing that, he continues, is plasma cash, which allows users to store valuable data – ether, for example – on the main blockchain, while still being able to trade it on the sidechain.  ""If the sidechain did something dishonest,"" he says, ""you could contest it on mainnet and you would be able to withdraw your assets back to mainnet.""  For now, ZombieChain is just an idea, but it has the potential to allow new projects to deploy their dapps without sacrificing too much in terms of either scalability or decentralization.

42380707,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zC5J,1527414001,Leadership Shifts to Usher in New Era for Monero Cryptocurrency,"Monero is gearing up to decentralize all over again.  Since the cryptocurrency launched in 2014, its gregarious South African project lead, Riccardo ""Fluffypony"" Spagni, has become the project's unofficial figurehead, in part because of lack of competition. Famed for its privacy, monero has attracted contributors who prefer anonymity. Yet Spagni's business ventures, which include three crypto startups, have pushed him into the limelight.  But Spagni is also starkly different from other developers that have become synonymous with cryptocurrencies, like ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin or Zcash CEO Zooko Wilcox, in that he does not influence monero's technical development and has little interest in doing so in the future.  ""I was the lead maintainer across all the projects, and at some point last year I was like: I can't do this,"" Spagni said.  This decision in mind, Spagni told CoinDesk he intends to slowly step back from other community leadership roles throughout 2018. An anonymous monero user called ""Luigi1111"" now handles the monero website and graphical user interface, while rotating volunteers routinely host the weekly IRC chats for monero developers.  ""I will always be an advocate for privacy, and for monero, a part of the monero community, but my actual responsibilities by definition need to be reduced,"" Spagni continued, speaking to why he plans to step away from moderating the platform's Reddit and Telegram groups.  Spagni's move is actually part of a broader shift in the monero community to balance business adoption with the cypherpunk ethos of decentralization. Open-source community veteran Felix Honigwachs became CEO of Spagni's startup GloBee in May, promptly followed by Paul Shapiro taking the reigns of Spagni's second crypto startup, MyMonero.  Shapiro aims to drive more mainstream, commercial usage rather than mostly speculative trading. ""It isn't really even a good idea for the lead maintainer of a project to run a web wallet that he's profiting from,"" Shapiro said.  On the other hand, Spagni is focused on fostering the type of open-source lab modeled by ChainCode Labs in New York, where bitcoin developers work on free software tools, through his seventh startup Tari Labs. This new company is developing a monero-based protocol for trading digital assets like concert tickets or customer loyalty points.  As Spagni pivots, Tari Labs co-founders Dan Teree and Naveen Jain are in charge of business development.  If all goes according to plan, Spagni will become less influential on the broader community as monero simultaneously boosts its value and use as a medium of exchange. Diverse users and use cases, the thinking goes, make for a healthier currency.  Shapiro said:  ""The number one most important thing for monero is creating a circular economy.""  Tari Labs meets lightning  Meanwhile in Johannesburg, Spagni aims to hire roughly 20 South African developers and researchers for Tari Labs who will also contribute to scaling solutions like the lightning network, which aims to make cryptocurrency transactions cheaper and faster.  This team will build a lightning router for instant transaction across a wide range of blockchain-based assets, including commodities such as custom gear for video game characters.  ""You'll be able to run our lighting router and connect it to a bitcoin node, a litecoin node, a monero node, a Tari node, full-on interoperability,"" Spagni said. ""And you will be plugging in to the regular lightning network. So you'll be able to perform atomic swaps through Tari, over our router, to another lightning node.""  According to Terree and Jain, Tari Labs will take at least two years to launch the full Tari network with distributed tokens because they want time for continuous feedback as developers build the new protocol.  Jain said they will release the first use case this year, then encourage ""a tight feedback loop"" with the broader monero community.  ""We're here to show you can build second layer things on top of monero,"" he said.  Once layered scaling solutions become more popular, they could help offer cheaper options for MyMonero users as well. Plus, offering sustainable job opportunities outside of fintech hubs like San Francisco and New York are a part of the monero community's push for greater inclusivity.  The next step toward greater decentralization includes reducing any specific individual's influence over a multitude of community media channels. Although the idea is to make the ecosystem more resilient and remove any single point of failure, the shift may also help preserve Spagni's sanity.  MyMonero rising  But that's not to say monero won't have leaders, it will. The hope, however, is that there are more, and that they are all working on common goals.  MyMonero's Shapiro is an early candidate, given his attempts to work out a business model for MyMonero that doesn't rely exclusively on investors or advisors like Spagni. Indeed, this entrepreneur has an ambitious monetization plan for MyMonero, including everything from fintech partnerships to subscription wallet services for merchants.  Yet a big problem he sees for the technology is that transaction fees present a huge hurdle for his target customers.  According to monero.howhttps://www.monero.how/monero-transaction-fee-calculator, monero transaction fees typically range from a few cents to $2. Converting monero into bitcoin for vendors that only accept the latter can accrue even higher fees. That's where a scaling solution like lightning, which enables swaps between blockchains, would be particularly handy.  The examples show how scaling monero will take a combined effort of developers and entrepreneurs.  In the meantime, Shapiro is relaunching free MyMonero wallet apps, which already have roughly 500,000 users, while hiring new staff and opening an office in either North Carolina or Tennessee. An updated MyMonero desktop app is already on Github, while the revised iOS wallet was just approved by Apple for imminent release.  Next, Shapiro will team up with Honigwachs for a partnership that allows users to buy monero directly through MyMonero wallets and automatically convert monero into bitcoin when sending payments to a bitcoin wallet.  ""We want people to be able to buy monero with a credit card, without leaving the app at all,"" Shapiro said. ""That way if they are on the go, at a coffee shop, but don't have enough monero [to transact], they can just get it immediately.""  These features all aim to reduce the friction keeping users from spending their cryptocurrency, a goal that now appears to be at the fore for the project as a whole.  Shapiro said:  ""Our mission is usability for ordinary people.""
