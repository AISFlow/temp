Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin retreats from $42K as U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell suggests that ""front-end loading"" might be the plan for U.S. monetary policy makers as they hike interest rates.  Insights: Listed crypto companies' share prices have underperformed bitcoin (BTC) price moves.  Technician's take: BTC is holding support, similar to what occurred in late March before a 16% price rise.

And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $40,745  Ether (ETH): $3,004  Top Gainers  There are no gainers in CoinDesk 20 today.  Top Losers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector EOS EOS −9.7% Smart Contract Platform Solana SOL −7.1% Smart Contract Platform Bitcoin BTC −6.2% Currency  Bitcoin retreats after touching $42K  ""Front-end loading"" sounds like the early phase of a construction project, and that's the phrase Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell used Thursday to describe a possible strategy by the U.S. central bank to tamp down inflation running at a four-decade high.  The idea is the Fed might enact a series of steep interest-rate increases – say 0.5 percentage point per meeting, versus the more typical 0.25 percentage point – to make sure consumer prices don't spiral out of control.  “We’re really going to be raising rates and getting expeditiously to levels that are more neutral and then that are actually tight,” Powell said during a panel with European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, arranged by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  The risk is that higher borrowing costs crimp spending and investment, and then the economy slides into a recession.  Bitcoin is seen by many investors as an inflation hedge, and it's also seen as a risky asset that might come under pressure during a period of shrinking economic growth. So Powell's hawkish tone was enough to send bitcoin's price lower, just as the largest cryptocurrency appeared to be gaining steam.  The price reached a 10-day high, nearly touching $43,000, but then slid back toward $40,000, erasing recent days' gains.  ""Bitcoin price action has continued to whipsaw between a wider range of $38-$47,000,” Tammy Da Costa, analyst at DailyFX, told CoinDesk's Angelique Chen.  U.S. stocks ended the day lower, and U.S. Treasury yields rose.  Markets  S&P 500: -1.5%  DJIA: -0.8%  Nasdaq: -2.1%  Gold: $1,953, -0.1%     Insights  One Year After Coinbase’s IPO, Most Listed Crypto Companies Are Underwater  The last quarter of 2020 was an exciting time. Bitcoin seemed meteoric, given the new institutional interest in the asset class. Coinbase Global (COIN) filed preliminary paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a listing, and soon after, pre-IPO contracts were trading on FTX that valued the company close to $75 billion.  But just over a year since its IPO, Coinbase’s stock is down nearly 55%, underperforming bitcoin, which is down around 26% for the same time period (to be sure, many tech stocks are also down for this same period), as investors’ appetite for listed crypto companies seems to have waned.  In a note published last year, Singapore’s QCP Capital wrote that investors were no longer assigning a strong premium to licenses and regulatory friendliness like they once did, which would in turn put pressure on Coinbase’s stock.  “That premium has been on the pretext that it would give them a free pass while governmental agencies took their war on crypto to other platforms and exchanges instead, like Binance,” QCP wrote at the time. “If now, a regulated U.S. entity who is offering a product that is already being offered in the U.S., going through the proper legal route, can face such harsh action, then nobody is assured to be safe anymore.”  Coinbase’s regulatory compliance and U.S. base also keeps it out of some of the more interesting parts of crypto like lending. It also meant that Coinbase had a slow start in the derivatives market, which overtook the spot market for the first time in June 2021, behind many of its non-US-based rivals, likely turning investors away from its stock.  Hong Kong’s BC Technology Group, which runs the institutional-focused digital assets platform OSL, has seen a similar fate with its stock. Although it had a brief rally after positive earnings, the stock is down nearly 66% over the last year.  Mining stocks aren’t fairing much better. RIOT Blockchain (RIOT), which operates bitcoin mining farms throughout the U.S., is down nearly 66% over the last year while Marathon Digital (MARA), another miner, is down 40%. Canaan (CAN), a manufacturer of mining equipment, is down nearly 70%.  Michael Del Grosso, an analyst at Compass Point Research who covers miners, explains this poor performance by saying in a previous CoinDesk interview, “Mining stocks currently are leveraged plays on the price of bitcoin.”  These mining stocks had their moment when China ordered operations shut in-country and the global hash rate was in flux. But as that sorted itself out and bitcoin flirted with all-time highs yet couldn’t sustain itself, the stocks sank like rocks.  Currently, Compass Point maintains a neutral rating on Riot Blockchain.  This begs the question, are there any listed crypto companies that are actually above the water line?  Indeed there are: crypto banks like Silvergate Capital and Signature Bank.  Both of these banks, which provide banking services to crypto exchanges, have managed to outperform bitcoin over the last year. Given that they are tied to exchanges, their value is based upon the volume of transactions on an exchange.  And volume is maintained at a brisk pace, as is demand for other tools Silvergate provides, like Leverage.  So perhaps the problem with these listed companies isn’t a market hostility to listed crypto companies, but rather that the market needs more than them just being a proxy for the price of bitcoin.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Momentum Strengthens Despite Short-Term Pause  Bitcoin (BTC) generated a positive momentum signal on the daily price chart, similar to what occurred in late March. That suggests buyers could remain active toward the $46,700 resistance level.  The cryptocurrency is up 4% over the past week.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the four-hour chart is declining from overbought levels, which typically occurs during a brief pullback in price. Still, support at $40,000 could maintain BTC's recovery phase.  Initial resistance is seen at $42,400, where sellers were active earlier in the New York trading day. On the daily chart, however, the RSI is rising from oversold levels with stronger momentum, indicating a rise in bullish sentiment.

In recent years, it has gained widespread acceptance as a viable investment option and a means of exchanging goods and services. Much of this can be attributed to growing support from mainstream institutions and the present price trajectory. Even as the price of bitcoin rises, the public&apos;s perception of it is evolving as well. While cryptocurrency is expected to play a key role in global financial markets over the next decade, what does this mean for bitcoin? Can its public persona transform from a nerd-adjacent notion to a genuine status symbol? The Changing Public Image of Bitcoin The general public&apos;s perception of bitcoin has evolved significantly over time. Early on, bitcoin was viewed as a quirky technological concept that only the most ardent advocates would become involved with. This is because at one point in time websites were genuinely giving away bitcoin for free every day to draw attention to the digital currency. After the first big bull run in the early 2010s, several of these early investors made enormous gains from their bitcoin holdings, which led to additional media interest in Bitcoin.

According to the order, in which Anchorage neither admits nor denies the OCC's findings, Anchorage didn't have an anti-money laundering/Bank Secrecy Act program that met federal requirements regarding customer due diligence. The company now has 15 days to create a compliance committee where a majority of members aren't Anchorage employees. That committee will oversee Anchorage's compliance with the consent order.

Anchorage, however, has already ""begun corrective action and is committed to taking all necessary and appropriate steps to remedy the deficiencies identified by the OCC,"" the order said.  The compliance committee will have to send the OCC progress reports every 30 days, and Anchorage will have to ensure it hires an executive to oversee Bank Secrecy Act requirements as part of the consent order.

In fact, the project is more about exploring what is possible with NFTs.  The recent NFT bull run, which was mostly about digital artworks and sports collectibles, is probably just a scratch on the surface of what’s possible with the technology. So-called utility NFTs are now expanding beyond things like decentralized finance (DeFi) and into enterprise uses like supply chain track-and-trace.  “We saw that NFTs could be anything, and became curious as to whether they could be more than one thing,” said Lucia Gallardo, CEO of Emerge, the project behind AEternals NFTs. “As well as being artful and collectible, could NFTs have utility? Can you gamify them and make them more interactive,” she said in an interview with CoinDesk.  Read more: Smart Offsets: Algorand Ups Sustainability Pledge With Self-Executing Code  AEternals NFTs, available via the Winklevoss-owned Nifty Gateway, offer the token holder a real-time connection to plots of virgin rainforest, said Gallardo.  In other words, if it happens to rain on your part of the forest, it rains on your NFT, Gallardo said.  The NFTs also grow and evolve over time, a process fueled by the owner’s engagement in game playing or by participating in social-impact community events or donating to a charity like Rainforest Partnership.  This adds an element of financial sovereignty into the NFT, as opposed to floor prices being set solely by some NFT platform, Gallardo said, because the owner decides how much to evolve their plot before selling it, and more evolved plots are valued differently.  Read more: Solana-Based Climate Change Project Employs ‘NFTrees’ to Save Rainforests  However, rendering and minting three-dimensional, metamorphic NFTs on Ethereum consumes quite a lot of power.  Gallardo said the project has decreased its carbon emissions by 64 tons of CO2 and is also doing novel things like recycling the heat produced to render the collection to supply almost 41,000 hot showers to social housing units in France.  Might other base blockchain layers be a better fit?  “We do sometimes get asked why we went with Ethereum as opposed to some other protocol that’s touting mechanisms that are more environmentally friendly,” said Gallardo. “While we can’t completely cut all carbon emissions from this project we have done a huge amount to lessen them. In the end, we wanted a protocol that people who are new to this space could trust.”",POSITIVE,없음,ALGO | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/21/these-utility-nfts-look-to-gamify-rainforest-protection,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5c214d817749c742b92b9ad6f8789aa936f46277-4000x2250.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The cryptocurrency is showing signs of improving momentum, according to some technical indicators, which could support further upside toward $47,000-$50,000.  On Thursday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said raising the benchmark U.S. interest rate by 50 basis points (0.5 percentage point) “will be on the table” for the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in May. So far, tighter monetary policy has been a headwind for speculative assets such as stocks and cryptocurrencies this year.  Just launched! Please sign up for our daily Market Wrap newsletter explaining what happens in crypto markets – and why.  Alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) continued their lead relative to bitcoin on Thursday, indicating a greater appetite for risk among traders. For example, Tron's TRX token surged by 14%, compared with BTC's flat performance over the same period. The Graph's GRT token also rose by as much as 6% on Thursday.  Stocks were mixed on Thursday, while the 10-year Treasury yield ticked higher toward 2.9% as investors positioned themselves for higher interest rates.

The chart on the left shows the Altcoin Season Index, using data provided by Blockchain Center. Currently, 29% of the top 50 cryptos have outperformed bitcoin over the past 90 days. Theoretically, altcoin season is confirmed when 75% of all cryptos perform better than bitcoin over the same period. By then it's too late to position for a rally, so a reading above 50% could signal a shift from bearish to bullish sentiment among traders.  Still, the chart on the right shows only 41% of the top cryptos have outperformed bitcoin over the past year. That suggests some caution among traders after a strong market rally in 2020.  Upside could be limited over the next few months if buyers are quick to take profits in the altcoin space. For now, risk-on is back.

42423478,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2a6Dh,1650571677,Solana-Based Climate Change Project Employs ‘NFTrees’ to Save Rainforests,"As little as $300: That’s the cost of buying one hectare of virgin rainforest in Paraguay, thereby protecting it from being cut down, bulldozed and turned into a cattle ranch.  Raising cryptocurrency donations to purchase forest from landowners, enlarging national parks and preventing deforestation is the goal of GainForest. The project combines blockchain-based smart contracts with satellite imagery, drone photography and data science, and has steadily grown since winning the United Nations COP 23 Hack4Climate contest back in 2017.  Most recently, GainForest began working with the Environmental Ministry of Paraguay (MADES) to protect thousands of hectares of forest in Paraguay’s Gran Chaco Americano, one of the most vulnerable areas to climate change, and one of the planet’s main carbon sinks.  It makes GainForest the first government-backed green crypto project, according to GainForest co-founder David Dao. The initial results will be presented at the UN COP27 in Egypt, he added.  Crypto for good  Most people are aware of the alarming rate of deforestation happening across the globe. Each year, the acreage of rainforests that is destroyed absorbs almost the equivalent of the annual carbon emissions of a large, industrialized nation like the U.S. or China.  However, the cost of stopping deforestation, particularly in places like Paraguay where land was sold in the 1980s for as little as $20 per hectare, remains “insanely cheap,” said Dao.  “The price for one hectare of virgin forest land is now between $300 and $500,” said Dao in an interview with CoinDesk. “In order to create a cattle farm you need to build infrastructure, so the upfront costs for the landowner could easily be another $1,000 per hectare. So, we’re trying to reach them the moment before they decide to build a cattle ranch, and say, ‘Hey, this $1,000 is not worth the investment; Paraguay can do better.’”  Dao and his partners, whose backgrounds are in artificial intelligence, are using the Solana blockchain (for its low-carbon footprint) to lock up crypto donations that are tied to highly accurate satellite and drone data charting areas of forest. Decentralized data storage is done via the Filecoin Green project. Those who donate receive data drops, wildlife camera pictures and can be connected to indigenous tribes, all in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), dubbed “NFTrees.”  Read more: Filecoin Might Have a Way for Bitcoin to Fight Its Energy Critics (if Miners Use It)  The detailed algorithmic mapping of what’s happening in each forest project removes the uncertainty associated with traditional carbon offsetting; the latter usually involves planting trees somewhere, but tends to leave those who donate only guessing the exact impact of their green investment.  If GainForest can’t buy a piece of land, the alternative is creating a legal contract such that the landowner is paid over time providing they don’t deforest, said Dao. Several studies estimate that giving out between $1 billion and $2 billion per year could halt deforestation globally, he pointed out.  “Deforestation could be stopped from today in just two years, we just need enough money,” said Dao. “People need opportunities that make forest conservation financially sustainable.

42411796,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glg5ZI,1650569088,What Is PancakeSwap? Here’s How to Start Using It,"The explosion of decentralized finance (DeFi) has unlocked new financial iterations that revolve around autonomy, speed and inclusion – a combination lacking in the traditional financial realm.  This is especially true for the budding decentralized exchange (DEX) sector, where users increasingly engage with autonomous markets anchored by blockchain technology.  A prime example of such a market is PancakeSwap, the BNB Chain (formerly Binance Smart Chain) variant of decentralized exchanges like UniSwap (UNI) and SushiSwap (SUSHI).  In this guide, we will explain the workings of PancakeSwap and discuss some ways you can start utilizing its features.  What is PancakeSwap?  PancakeSwap is a decentralized exchange native to BNB Chain. In other words, it shares some similarities with established platforms like UniSwap in that users can swap their coins for other coins without the input of middleman services.  The only difference is that PancakeSwap focuses on BEP20 tokens – a specific token standard developed by Binance.  The BEP20 standard is essentially a checklist of functions new tokens must be able to perform in order to be compatible with the broader Binance ecosystem of dapps, wallets and other services.  How PancakeSwap works  For those unfamiliar with the workings of decentralized exchanges, they use a special system known as an automated market maker (AMM) so the entire process does not require order books or a single, intermediary company to facilitate trading.  In essence, there is no need for an order matching system since traders trade against liquidity pools instead of counterparties. A liquidity pool in this context refers to funds deposited by investors – which can be anyone from around the world – into smart contracts for the aim of providing liquidity to traders.  With this system, buyers do not have to wait to be matched with sellers, or vice versa. Whenever someone wants to trade one token for another, they simply deposit the token they have into the pool and withdraw the other token they wish to receive.  For instance, if you want to change a particular BEP20-based token, say ALPHA to BNB on PancakeSwap, all you need to do is find an ALPHA/BNB pool that has sufficient liquidity (meaning there’s enough tokens inside the pool to facilitate your trade).  Then, you would need to deposit your ALPHA tokens and automatically receive an amount of BNB based on the most recent exchange rate.  That said, PancakeSwap is not just for traders. You can also take up the role of a liquidity provider (that is, you can deposit tokens in a liquidity pool for the chance of earning a share of trading fees paid by those trading against the pool in question).  Yield Farming is another income-generating opportunity available on PancakeSwap. With this, you can farm for a token called CAKE (more on this later).  There is also the possibility of winning the lottery when you accurately guess a winning set of numbers. We will take a look at all of these services and features in the next section.  Read More: What Is Yield Farming? The Rocket Fuel of DeFi, Explained  Getting started with PancakeSwap  The first thing you need to do before using PancakeSwap is to create a wallet compatible with BNB Chain.  Some of the available options are:  Trust Wallet.  BNB Chain Wallet.  Coinbase Wallet.  You can also use MetaMask, even though you may need to configure your MetaMask wallet so that it can start working with BNB Chain-based decentralized apps like PancakeSwap.  You can do this by accessing the Settings menu on MetaMask. From here, locate the Networks option and click on Add Network in the top right corner of the page. Once you have done this, you will be navigated to a page where you can fill in the following parameters:  Network Name: BNB Chain  ChainID: 56  Symbol: BNB  Block Explorer URL: https://bscscan.com  By doing so, you have successfully connected your MetaMask wallet to the mainnet version of BSC.  Adding liquidity on PancakeSwap  After connecting your wallet to BNB Chain, you can start interacting with dapps like PancakeSwap and add liquidity to one of the pools on the platform.  To do this, connect your wallet to PancakeSwap. You can do this by clicking on Connect Wallet at the top right corner of PancakeSwap’s homepage.  Once your wallet is connected, click on the Trade menu and select Liquidity. On the Liquidity page, select Add Liquidity and choose the token pair you wish to deposit. Note, you will need to deposit both tokens into the pool at a predetermined ratio.  You will then be required to sign the transaction from your wallet (which is free to do).  Thereafter, you will receive liquidity provider (LP) tokens indicating your share of the liquidity deposited in the chosen pool.  Farming on PancakeSwap  Now you have LP tokens, you can take advantage of your holding by depositing them in a “farm” to earn CAKE tokens – the native cryptocurrency of the PancakeSwap platform. Farms are essentially LP staking pools, and allow you to earn additional interest on your holdings.  Below are the steps you need to take to farm on PancakeSwap.  On the PancakeSwap homepage, click the Earn menu and select the Farms option to navigate to the pages where the available farms are listed.  Scan through the list of farms to select the one that is compatible with the LP tokens in your possession. You might also want to consider the annual percentage rate (APR) offered to stakers.  Once you have selected a farm, click on Enable and confirm the action on your wallet. Next, the Enable button will switch to Stake LP. Click this option to navigate to a page where you can enter the number of LP tokens you wish to stake.  Click on the Confirm button, and your wallet will request that you confirm the transaction. After doing this, you can find your staked LP balance showing the amount you have in the farm.  If at any point you wish to withdraw your earnings and staked LP tokens, you can click on Harvest.  Staking on PancakeSwap  It is possible to compound your earnings by staking your CAKE token on the platform’s Syrup pools. To do this, click on Pools on the Earn drop-down menu. Here, you will find the pools available, the annual percentage yield (APY) of each and the total amount staked.  First, you need to select one of the pools. Then, you can activate CAKE staking on your wallet by clicking the Enable button. Next, enter the amount of CAKE you want to stake and click Confirm. Depending on the pool you have chosen, your earnings can be harvested and re-staked in the same pool automatically.  Breaking all of this down, here’s how a typical yield farming strategy might look on BNB Chain.  You deposit two tokens, let’s say ALPHA and BNB into the ALPHA/BNB liquidity pool and receive LP tokens. This means you can now start earning a portion of transaction fees paid by traders who use the pool.  Next, you take your LP tokens and deposit them into the appropriate “farm” to earn CAKE tokens.  Finally, you take your CAKE tokens and stake them in a Syrup pool to earn additional interest.  As you can see, by depositing two tokens and taking advantage of several staking pools you’re able to maximize your potential returns with multiple yields.  Hitting a jackpot on PancakeSwap  There is another service on PancakeSwap that promises passive income, called a “lottery.” However, unlike the products highlighted so far, this is more like gambling, as you need to guess a winning four-digit combination made up of numbers between 1 and 14. An example is 2-8-10-14.  When you buy a ticket, the system will auto-generate a random combination for you. At the end of the lottery session, you will emerge as the winner and receive 50% of the lottery pool if your combination matches the winning ticket. Note that the positions of the numbers are also considered.  But what if your ticket does not match the winning tickets? Well, you can still earn rewards if two or more numbers in your winning ticket match the numbers on the winning ticket. However, they must be in the same position as the numbers on the winning combination.  NFTs on PancakeSwap  On PancakeSwap, there is also the opportunity to trade BNB Chain-based non-fungible tokens (NFTs). To list your own NFTs on PancakeSwap, all you need to do is apply by filling out this form.

42394217,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvaSeb,1650568173,"Calling Out the Sexism in Bitcoin, Crypto","It’s no secret that the cryptocurrency industry skews young, male and white. Although diversity is part of crypto’s MO – more forms of money, more voices, more worldviews – there’s nothing inherently wrong with a young industry attracting a particular socio-economic group at first.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Decentralization is a process, after all. Even the commodity-money bitcoin, when launched, could have been deemed a security if regulators cared enough to look. But its creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, stepped away from his amassed fortune and the hard-capped coin took root elsewhere.  Bitcoin is for everyone.  That’s why it’s particularly worthwhile to call out discrimination when it happens. On Wednesday, a pseudonymous figure on Crypto Twitter who goes by rand0 (@Rand0mGuest2) published a frankly galling blog, “That’s sexual harassment, bro.” The title precedes the content, filled as it is with stereotypes, casual sexism and a twisted view of who is on top and who is on bottom.  I don’t know the story behind the post outside of the context Rand0mGuest2 chooses to bring in. Apparently, his friend, who goes by a raunchy pseudonym that means a boy who sleeps around, wanted to make a statement about the crypto influencer Rachel “CryptoFinally” Siegel and apparently “exposed” her as a scammer by posting a “well timed creeper pic of this thot.”  The semipro class  Siegel is part of a class of semiprofessionals in the crypto industry who offer market insights on social platforms like Twitter and YouTube, but don’t call it “investment advice.” She’s sold NFTs (non-fungible tokens), and at times, she has promoted various coins.  To rand0, “CryptoFinally” represents the worst of the “crypto” industry. Because she’s not all-in on bitcoin, she’s just another person degraded by the “fiat mindset” – a hustler in it for the money, not for changing the world.  I’m not looking to “white knight” for Siegel, who is capable of defending herself. Nor do I want to dwell on rand0’s commentary, making it out to be representative of the industry at large or the culture around “the ‘corn.” It was a blog post, barely read, barely commented upon. (It should be said, Siegel once took offense to a profile written about her published on CoinDesk.)  But there are a few things worth delineating. First, it’s absolutely immature to objectify women. Rand0 spends some time reflecting on Siegel’s “flat ass” and asserts she’s not only in crypto to “dump [her] bags on unsuspecting noobs,” but to pick up a rich, caretaker boyfriend. He calls her tattoos “trashy” and lumps her in with other “dishonest courtesans.”  Putting aside the fact that human sexuality is complicated, that love is blind, that not everyone likes the things you do, this is just unnecessary bigotry. Call it “locker room talk” or “boys being boys,” there’s no reason in the 21st century to attempt jokes like this. They were never funny – and “butterface” is a dead pun. If you disagree with how CryptoFinally lives her life, address her ideas.  A life without principles  All of this is worth saying precisely because rand0 wants to be talking at a higher level. He has an ethical, if traditionalist, mandate. He seems to say modern life – with all of its conveniences and superficialities – allows people to live without principle. And those selling altcoins are the worst.  “[Rhymes-with-mitt-coin] influencers in 2022, where bitcoin maximalism is blatant and obvious, have no moral compass,” he writes, holding that small corner of crypto to account. Bitcoiners, an emergent identity formed around an immaterial object, are fighting not only for a world where money cannot be debased, but people and culture, too.  Again, rand0 doesn’t represent every bitcoiner’s perspective. But he is tapping into a fairly common eschatological view of the world of what happens after bitcoin wins. Hyperbitcoinization is a utopia: It’s the idea that all other assets will gradually depreciate against BTC, leaving early stackers in a privileged position.  See also: 3 Stories of Bitcoin Changing Lives Outside the Dollar Bubble | Book excerpt  Privileged might not be the word they choose – they have earned their coming success, they have stacked sats and delayed gratification. They have a low-time preference, necessary to smooth over bitcoin’s current volatility, while everyone else seeks cheap thrills.  “Bitcoin is about accepting your place in life, how you got there and why. Owning it, and doing something about it,” rand0 writes.  Success not guaranteed  The thing is, there is nothing guaranteeing the success of the bitcoin experiment. It, like all cryptocurrencies, has existed only in an age of cheap money, an age when the Federal Reserve experimented with low interest rates and quantitative easing to push people and companies into riskier and riskier assets.  See also: Will Rising Interest Rates Sink the Crypto Ecosystem? | Opinion  Bitcoin, hailed as an inflation hedge, is at the far end of the risk curve. Bitcoiners may not like it, but bitcoin is treated as a tech stock. The mental contortions necessary to see bitcoin as rand0 wants it to be seen seemingly inflect his other views.  “Bitcoin appreciates, girls like CryptoFinally depreciate rapidly. The male to female ratio has to change eventually. The cards aren’t in her favor,” he writes.  I mean, I can only speak from my perspective of being a highly educated, sexually fulfilled white male, but I believe it when women say they are turned off by bitcoin, or when others in the industry say that sexism is rampant, and that might make it difficult to lessen the “male to female” ratio.  Rand0 tries to make it out that Siegel is using the “culture war” to her advantage and that she’s trying to cancel others for criticizing her. I’m also anticipating that he will think some s**tty writer from CoinDesk is trying to cancel him. That’s not my aim, although I agree with Rand0, that people should be held to account for what they do and say.  I hope Rand0 and his friend (whose name rhymes with bitcoin muck-toy) do settle down with loving partners, and that bitcoin also does well, but they are no more assured of achieving earthly bliss than bitcoin winning, especially if people like them keep acting like this. Have a little humility. And have a little decency, too.

As of press time the largest cryptocurrency was up 1.1% in the past 24 hours to $41,498, putting more breathing room between the price and last week's trading level, which was mostly below $40,000.  U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Thursday that raising the benchmark U.S. interest rate by 50 basis points (0.5 percentage point) “will be on the table” for the next Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) meeting in May in remarks at the International Monetary Fund debate. It was widely expected that there will be a 50 basis point rate hike in May or June to combat inflation.  ""Bitcoin price action has continued to whipsaw between a wider range of $38 - $47,000 which has thus far remained intact since the beginning of the year,” said Tammy Da Costa, analyst at DailyFX, “Due to the high correlation recently seen between bitcoin and tech stocks, there was a degree of concern about how crypto would react. However, bulls held ground above short-term support at the $40,000 level which now brings the psychological level of $44,000 into play.”  The Crypto Fear and Greed Index is at the “Fear” level at the moment. “Retail interest in the crypto market is waning as Google searches for bitcoin have plummeted to lows not seen in over a year” wrote Marcus Sotiriou, analyst at the UK based digital asset broker GlobalBlock in a newsletter, “Historically, a significantly low interest from retail has created profitable buying opportunities.”  “Despite retail being fearful and uninterested,” wrote Sotiriou, “institutional adoption continues.""

That's significant because it shows how aggressively officials plan to tamp down inflation that has climbed to a rate of 8.5%, the fastest rate in four decades. In recent years, the Fed has rarely hiked interest rates by more than 25 basis points at a time.  “I would say 50 basis points will be on the table for the May meeting,” the Powell said on a panel presented by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) alongside European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde and other representatives from the IMF, Indonesia and Barbados.  In its March meeting, members of the FOMC agreed on a hike of 25 basis points, but Powell said that it would be appropriate to “move a little more quickly.”  It's “absolutely essential to restore price stability,” Powell said.  “It may be that the actual [inflation] peak was in March, but we don’t know that, so we’re not going to count on it,” he added.  “We’re really going to be raising rates and getting expeditiously to levels that are more neutral and then that are actually tight ... if that turns out to be appropriate once we get there,” Powell said.  Given that the crypto market has been increasingly moving in correlation with the equity market, with the 90-day correlation between bitcoin (BTC) and the S&P 500 hitting a 17-month high in March, crypto traders are watching macroeconomic indicators.  This is the last time that Powell is scheduled to deliver public remarks before Federal Reserve officials go into the FOMC blackout period before their two-day meeting on May 4.

In 2021, NFTs sited a 21,000% growth from the previous year to 17.6 billion. On the other hand, the metaverse market size stood at $38.85 billion last year, with an estimated increase of up to $47.48B in 2022. Most times, people tend to assume that NFTs and the metaverse are similar. It can be attributed to both being quite popular in the blockchain gaming industry. However, NFTs can be defined as a unique digital representation of physical assets, while the metaverse is a blockchain-based digital environment. Despite being different, the combination of digital avatars and real-life identities presents new opportunities for defining access to the metaverse using NFTs. Hence, several new projects have emerged in the past year focused on addressing the intersection of NFTs and the metaverse.

42423462,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2a5nh,1650564767,New York Man Arrested for Alleged $1.8M Crypto Mining Scam,"The Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested a 37-year-old man on Wednesday it says defrauded more than a dozen victims out of a total of $1.8 million in a long-running crypto mining scam.  Between March 2019 and September 2021, officials say Chester “Chet” Stojanovich posed as a dealer of crypto mining equipment, convincing his would-be customers to fork over large payments for mining machines and miner-hosting services, which Stojanovich promised to arrange at a facility in Goose Bay in Canada's Newfoundland and Labrador province.  According to a complaint, Stojanovich never followed through on his promises and kept the majority of the money for himself.  Stojanovich is not the first person to be accused of running an elaborate scam involving crypto mining equipment. In 2020, a 60-year-old California man was arrested and charged with running a series of schemes, including a fake crypto mining operation that bilked five investors out of $550,000, half of which he spent on himself at casinos, restaurants, and hotels.  Stojanovich’s alleged scam is small potatoes compared with other crypto mining grifts. The notorious BitClub Ponzi scheme defrauded investors of $722 million over five years, purporting to sell shares of nonexistent crypto mining pools to gullible investors – only to pay them back with money from newer investors.  But unlike BitClub, Stojanovich’s alleged scam was not a Ponzi scheme – it was just old-fashioned fraud. He allegedly blew the majority of his customers’ cash on chartering flights on private jets and traveling in limousines, paying off more than $80,000 in personal credit card debt, throwing lavish parties and giving money to his wife.  The alleged scheme  According to the complaint, Stojanovich and various companies under his control, including Chet Mining, Chet Mining Canada and Phoenix Data LLC, told investors that he would purchase mining equipment on their behalf and then host that equipment at the Goose Bay facility for a set number of months.  However, the FBI alleges that Stojanovich did not purchase the equipment as promised, but instead “employed deceptive practices to create the illusion that such miners had been acquired and were being sued to provide hash power to the accounts of [his] customers.”  Stojanovich allegedly purchased a total of 72 S9 Miners from Amazon, and two other miners from eBay, which he largely used as props in the scheme. (He took payment from customers for nearly 1,500 S9 miners and over 1,500 L3 miners.)  When his customers grew suspicious and asked for evidence of their purchases, Stojanovich would send them photos of the miners he had bought, as well as photos of himself standing near the piled-up boxes, according to the complaint.  In one instance, an unnamed customer who had ordered 912 S9 miners from Stojanovich insisted that Stojanovich provide proof of the purchase, including “serial numbers, insurance policy documents or shipping documents.” When Stojanovich could not provide the proof, the customer demanded that he be taken to the purported hosting facility in Goose Bay – a 31-hour drive from New York City – to see his purchase for himself.  According to the FBI, Stojanovich agreed and, around Memorial Day weekend in 2019, he and the customer got a rental car and headed to Goose Bay. However, things between the pair crumbled as they neared the border of Canada, and Stojanovich allegedly told the customer that he would not be able to see the miners after all.  The FBI alleges that “the trip ended abruptly, in Buffalo, New York, where Stojanovich abandoned [the customer] at the airport and stated in substance and part that he would not pay any refund.”  A former employee of Stojanovich told the FBI that, when his boss returned from the trip, he admitted he had never purchased the S9 miners the customer had paid for.  Stojanovich allegedly continued to use photos and phony evidence of nonexistent hash power to soothe worried customers, but around September 2019 he stopped responding to all texts and emails.  Two months later he resurfaced, only to tell customers that the owner of the alleged Goose Bay hosting facility had gone bankrupt and run away with their equipment.  Lawsuits and more alleged fraud  In June 2020, six of Stojanovich’s alleged victims filed suit against him and two of his companies, alleging “civil RICO violations, breach of contract, fraud, conversion and unjust enrichment.”  According to the FBI, however, being sued did not prevent Stojanovich from trying his hand at a second scam. Between August and September 2021, Stojanovich convinced three brokers who represented clients interested in buying mining equipment to pay him nearly $200,000 for a total of 127 miners.  The customers only received three miners between them, according to the complaint. When they demanded refunds, the FBI says Stojanovich sent a series of bad checks before eventually refunding only $61,000 of their money – thus keeping $119,000 for himself.  According to the complaint, Stojanovich spent this money on “unrelated purchases of internet domain names … products of Apple, Inc. … hotels/restaurants, and payments to his wife/partner” as well as “payments of more than $33,000 to an online casino.”  In early March 2022, Stojanovich was ordered by a New York judge to appear at a deposition in the lawsuit filed against him in 2020. According to the FBI, Stojanovich lied under oath about the whereabouts of his cellphone and, when allowed to return to his car to obtain his cellphone, hid for the duration of the deposition, only returning to the courthouse when everyone else had left.  After that, Stojanovich allegedly moved to Canada.  His failure to comply with the lawsuit resulted in a default judgment against him. Stojanovich was found to be in civil contempt of court – a finding that carries with it hefty monetary penalties and potential criminal action.  Stojanovich was arrested in Champlain, N.Y., on Wednesday and charged with one count of wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.

42423467,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2a5vh,1650563733,"The Risks Behind LUNA-UST Stablecoin, According to a Bearish Academic","In the past year, the space-themed Terra blockchain network has rocketed to prominence. UST, the dollar-denominated digital asset at the center of this financial universe, is now the third-largest stablecoin. LUNA, that stablecoin’s ballast, hovers under $100 and is within the top 10 most-used cryptocurrencies. And the blockchain itself, primarily built and maintained by Terraform Labs, has become a hotbed for decentralized finance (DeFi) and other emerging market activities.  But that growth is likely “unsustainable,” University of Calgary law professor Ryan Clements said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover.” Worse, Terra’s principal backers – Terraform Labs, its CEO Do Kwon and the closely related Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) – are seemingly aware of “systemic risks” to its algorithmic stablecoin as they make moves to bolster its reserves and incentivize market demand.  ""The fact that Terra is acknowledging the need for reserves suggests that they don't think the ecosystem in and of itself is sufficient to be able to keep this peg,” Clements said Wednesday morning. Clements has long been bearish on “LUNA/UST,” having published an academic review of the mechanics of algorithmic stablecoins and their surrounding financial ecosystem last October.  Backing up: Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is tied to an outside asset, such as the U.S. dollar or gold, to stabilize the price and are useful in the wider crypto economy. Unlike so-called centralized stablecoins that maintain their peg to the greenback by holding reserves, UST relies on a relationship to its sister token, LUNA. Terra, which is algorithmically burned or minted as UST, U.S.-Terra LUNA floats above or below the $1 mark.  Theoretically, this means LUNA/UST can maintain itself without any assets or collateral. Though, historically, most other algorithmic, or uncollateralized, stablecoins (like Iron Finance's Titan Token) have crashed and burned.  The dynamics of the UST Terra-LUNA relationship have evolved over time. Last month, the recently incorporated LFG and other Terra backers announced plans to add bitcoin and AVAX as reserve assets, which could be sold off in case the relationship between UST-LUNA breaks down.  “Terra-UST was a purely algorithmic stablecoin,” Clements said, adding that with reserves it’s a different “version” of what was originally promised. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, he said, and even thinks the LFG has validated his predictions made last fall.  “Purely algorithm stablecoins are bound to fail without reserves,” Clements said, and has said. He’s not alone. Ex-International Monetary Fund risk analyst turned financial asset blogger John Kiff told CoinDesk in an email, “Despite Terra's great success so far, I'm not convinced of the robustness of algorithmic stablecoins. This all sounds very 2007-08ish!""  But the UST-Terra LUNA relationship still has its risks, as many bears are wont to note. There’s the natural volatility of the crypto market, the “inherently fragile” relationship in the LUNA-UST arbitrage and the risk that Terra’s use cases built around UST aren’t actually used. Perhaps the largest risk comes from the Terra-based Anchor protocol, a “decentralized” lending platform that pays nearly 20% yields to those willing to lend their assets to it. Currently, two-thirds of UST demand comes from Anchor, Clemens said, a phenomenon encouraged by Terraform Labs, which built Anchor to incentivize use of its blockchain.  Read more: Most Influential 2021: Do Kwon  However, lending demand on Anchor is significantly higher than borrowing demand on the protocol, and as a result, the Terra Foundation has to “inject” capital to maintain the attractive yields, Clements said. (Anchor recently announced it would move to adjusting its yields based on demand, rather than keeping it at an artificial limit of 20%.)  Clements points out that a number of factors could potentially cause instability in Anchor, causing UST to become unpegged, including a competing borrowing protocol taking liquidity out of Anchor. Terra’s staking rewards could also fall, he said, impacting that attractive lending rate.  “Having to inject liquidity into Anchor in order to maintain those yields…that looks very vulnerable to me over time,” he said.  Further, funny as it sounds, Terra’s bitcoin and AVAX reserves add their own risks depending on if they rise or fall. Likewise, Terra’s “unique whale-holder status” could create risks for the wider crypto ecosystem, due to problems of “cascading volatility” if they ever have to sell their bitcoin to maintain UST’s peg.  Read more: Tracking Luna Foundation Guard’s Bitcoin Purchases  “My argument is not that [Terra] cannot be stable, my argument is that in order for it to be stable there are a number of assumptions that have to hold,” Clements said.  He is calling for more transparency: Transparency around whether Terra plans to further its reserve strategy, clarity around the conditions in which it might sell its assets as well as other “disclosures and operational controls.”  “[Terra is] looking less and less decentralized over time and much more centralized,” he said.  “If we’re wanting to use this as a form of money, it could be helpful to have some understanding of where the vulnerabilities are and where the control mechanisms are,” he said.",NEGATIVE,LUNA,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | LUNA | TRADING,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/coindesk/2022/04/21/the-risks-behind-luna-ust-stablecoin-according-to-a-bearish-academic,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/88f319186335cdc32591e6e04fe9ced5921380bc-4928x3264.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Traditionally, money launders target getting their money to go through banking institutions, after which it becomes part of the economy. Blockchain networks are also prone to money laundering despite the measures to prevent fraudulent crypto transactions. However, the prevalence of vice in the banking sector is higher than its level on crypto platforms. The features of blockchain technology help keep the instances of crypto fraud at a low rate, which is not achievable by the banking sector. The banking industry relies on laws that punish money laundering, while crypto security features safeguard their networks. There are points to compare and explain the prevalence of money laundering in both industries.

Every crypto token generated history is traceable; thus easy to confirm the validity of all trades undertaken and the resulting coin transfers.

42421018,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXAoyD,1650561156,A Use Case You Can Eat: California Crabs Tracked by Helium Network,"In a typical year, Jameson Buffmire, a San Francisco-based tech executive, loses around 10 crab pots in the course of his hobby, catching the crustaceans off the California coast. Each pot costs upwards of $300. He has been trying to find a way to track them so he can work out whether they’re being removed or possibly even stolen.  “It’s incredibly frustrating to lose thousands of dollars of equipment and crab,” said Buffmire.  The Pacific Ocean is a pretty rough place to track an asset. “You can’t rely on mobile phones nearby, like Apple does with [its] AirTags, and even a cellular GPS tracker wouldn’t have coverage more than two miles off coast,” Buffmire said in an interview with CoinDesk.  So Buffmire had to get creative. In December, he turned to the Helium network – a blockchain-powered system of wireless nodes with its own cryptocurrency, HNT. He's now using Helium’s Long Range Wireless Network (LoRaWAN) with a Browan Industrial Tracker.  “It’s been an absolute game changer,” said Buffmire.  He said he has recovered three crab pots that were easily worth over $1,000 by using the Helium-powered trackers. “It feels magical to be able to open a phone and check the location of something so far away and in such a different environment,” added Buffmire.  Most crypto investors familiar with Helium know it as a blockchain network that leverages a decentralized global network of Internet hotspots. There's big money invested in the project's development: Nova Labs confirmed last month a $200 million Series D funding round led by Tiger Global, with participation from Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY) and others. The latest funding round brings the California-based company’s valuation to $1.2 billion.  Helium hotspot growth  There are currently 746,296 hotspots across the world, according to Helium's website. These devices double as network miners and wireless access points — initially to provide long-range connectivity to the ""Internet of Things"" or IoT devices, and in the long term to connect anything to the internet via a decentralized wireless network such as 5G.  But some customers are using the network to power products like sensors or tracking devices. These use cases range from coffee shops using the network to be notified when they're low on cold brew, to stores tracking foot traffic, and sensors for floods and air and water quality. This is done by pairing a LoRaWAN sensor with the Helium network.  In his day job, Buffmire is a vice president at CalChip Connect, a distributor of products behind IoT networks. They include products compatible with the Helium Network (such as miners) and other IoT solutions. In a previous job as an executive for Orange, a global mobile network operator, Buffmire worked with the Helium team on developer projects, but this was long before Helium launched its crypto-oriented strategy.  Once Helium announced its decentralized, incentive-built network, he was keen to learn more and bought some hotspots.  Buffmire chose a Browan tracker (which his company sells) for the crab-tracking project because it was easy to conceal inside a floating buoy and the tracker is hardy enough to be left out in the ocean for up to seven days at a time. The Browan tracker is a general-purpose (and waterproof) tracker, designed for GPS tracking on various applications: bicycles, cars or pets.  “With a little elbow grease and a lot of Gorilla Glue, I was able to conceal five of these in yellow float buoys,” said Buffmire.  Using the Helium network for tracking objects  The trackers require LoRaWAN connectivity from Helium hotspots. Helium hotspots are small devices that plug into a regular electric outlet and tap into existing Internet service and provide long-range connectivity to IoT devices.  Using a mapping app called TrackingForLess, Buffmire was able to render the GPS trackers for a small fee. He took a network tester out on a boat to test the coverage before distributing the crab pots. The coverage was impressive, said Buffmire, connecting to over six different hotspots on shore while out at sea. This was around 40 kilometers in distance.  In December, Buffmire took the crab pots out to sea and within 12 hours he noticed one of them was moving pretty fast.  “I pulled up the app and watched as half of my beloved crab pots were picked up and moved to the Berkeley Marina,” said Buffmire. So he called the police. The San Francisco Police claimed no jurisdiction as the theft happened on water.  Instead, the Berkeley police escorted Buffmire out onto the marina to track down what had happened.  Through the tracking app, Buffmire zoomed right in on the exact boat the crab pots were now on.  “The police informed the owners of the boat that I was on the lookout for my missing crab pots, and I got a very nice call from an officer with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife,"" said Buffmire.  The officer said that despite Buffmire's fastidiousness with the trackers, he had not properly marked the buoys with a fishing license number, and that they were in violation of a new rule – a no-flag restriction to protect migratory whales.  Instead of writing a citation for the lack of licensing, the officer was more interested in how he had found Buffmire in the first place, according to Buffmire. It was the tracking device, Buffmire responded.  They agreed to meet in San Francisco to drop off the seized equipment.  The officer was late, ""so I called to see where he was,” Buffmire said. “While leaving a voicemail, I realized I could just look up where he was.”  The officer and his staff were almost at the Farallon Islands, about 28 miles west of San Francisco in the open ocean.  “Clearly, the trackers were working fabulously,” said Buffmire.  Buffmire said they managed to meet up in the end and the officer encouraged him to make the crab-pot-tracker-buoy-on-the-helium-network a real product.  “That hasn’t happened quite yet, but I’ve enjoyed a tremendous amount of crab,” Buffmire said.  In the end, Buffmire says, he didn't get a citation.  “It was a really cool experience,"" he recalled. ""No citation, and a friendly officer also interested in the technology. It was quite cordial, in fact. He helped haul the pots back to my car, and showed me their (awesome) boat.”",POSITIVE,HNT,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | HNT,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/21/a-use-case-you-can-eat-california-crabs-tracked-by-helium-network,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/322adbf232c0da82875732adfca298b549d2b21d-1361x1021.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Now a16z is expanding its industry foothold with a new crypto research team.  “Today, we’re excited to announce the creation of a16z crypto research, a new kind of multidisciplinary lab that will work closely with our portfolio and others toward solving the important problems in the space and toward advancing the science and technology of the next generation of the internet,” a16z partners Ali Yahya and Chris Dixon wrote in an announcement blog post shared in advance with CoinDesk.  The a16z crypto research team will be led by Tim Roughgarden, who has spent 20 years as a researcher and computer science professor at Stanford University and Columbia University. Roughgarden specializes in algorithmic game theory and technical problems posed by Web 3. He joined the a16z crypto team last year as a research adviser.  “The combination of advantages that a16z offers – direct access to the most important technical problems currently faced by Web 3 founders, close collaboration with in-house engineering, regulatory and content teams, and the breadth and depth of Web 3 knowledge at the firm – would simply be impossible to replicate in an academic setting,” Roughgarden told CoinDesk in an email.  The rest of the founding a16z crypto research team is comprised of a group of multidisciplinary academics. Dan Boneh, a professor of computer science and electrical engineering at Stanford specializing in cryptography and computer security, will be promoted to senior research analyst four years after he joined a16z.

Since then, various developments have been made, and mileposts have been reached towards creating a real metaverse.

The exchange hired Seth Levy as head of market surveillance. Previously, he worked for U.S. regulator Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), Binance said in a press release on Thursday. Steven McWhirter joins from the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) as director of regulatory policy.  Binance is seeking to improve its image after coming under pressure from regulators worldwide in recent months. In the U.K., the FCA said Binance's local affiliate was not authorized to operate within the country; Japan’s Financial Services Agency said Binance is not registered to do business within the country; and as recently as, February the exchange halted activities in Israel. It appointed its first chief regulatory liaison officer in October.  The exchange launched a regulated subsidiary, Binance.US, in 2019. It has faced scrutiny from U.S. regulator the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) over U.S. customers potentially tradingderivatives. More regulation will be coming after President Joe Biden issued an executive order in March asking all federal agencies to coordinate their efforts in regulating the crypto sector.  Levy, who spent 16 years at FINRA and was most recently the senior director of trading analysis within the market regulation department, will oversee efforts to build out and implement a surveillance infrastructure and system.  ""Our goal is to ensure that Binance users are protected from any form of nefarious activity or bad actors,"" Levy said in the release.  McWhirter was at the FCA for nine years, most recently as strategy and engagement manager in the data, technology and innovation division. The U.K. earlier this month said it wants to become a crypto hub, and has shifted its regulatory efforts up a few gears by announcing a crypto policy package.

42411806,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glg6Cy,1650556301,What Is a Seed Phrase?,"Crypto can be full of perplexing and complicated jargon. So much of the terminology leaves you scratching your head, especially if you have never researched the topic before or are new to the space.  One of the terms you might’ve come across already is “seed phrase.” A seed phrase is a group of random words generated by your crypto wallet when you first set it up, and it's incredibly important to keep a record of these words.  It’s important to note, private keys and seed phrases are not the same, although both would allow an intruder to spend your coins within that wallet.  Read More: Your First Crypto Wallet: What Is a Crypto Wallet and How to Use It  Let’s dig deeper to find out precisely why your seed phrase is so important.  A seed phrase acts as your crypto wallet’s master key  A seed phrase can help you regain access to your crypto wallet and everything inside of it. If you had a mobile wallet and lost your phone, had a hardware wallet that broke or you used a web browser and your computer died, your seed phrase would allow you to set up a new wallet on a phone, browser or hardware device and regain complete access to your crypto.  Read More: Custodial vs. Non-Custodial Wallets  Keep it safe, keep it private  Investing in cryptocurrency can be empowering; however, with great power comes great responsibility. A seed phrase needs to be kept a secret at all costs, as anyone who knows your seed phrase can import a copy of your wallet onto their own device and empty it. They can do so because knowing your seed phrase gives them access to your private keys.  A private key is used in transactions to verify ownership of a blockchain address.  Anyone can send transactions to a public key, however, a private key is required to “unlock” them and prove that you’re the owner of the cryptocurrency that was received in the transaction.  This is why private keys are important, and why someone with your seed phrase could do a lot of damage.  A common scam technique involves someone pretending to be from a wallet company asking you to verify ownership of a wallet by asking for your seed phrase. No credible company will ask you for this information. Ever. So be vigilant for this type of fraud.  Since you will be the sole person with that seed phrase, you must keep track of it.  What does a seed phrase look like?  Each seed phrase is pulled from a list of 2,048 words. Rather than a numeric password with long strings of numbers, a seed phrase is a series of between 12-24 simple randomized words, such as “eager,” “rich,” “one,” “river” or “iron.”  The idea of using a series of words instead of a jumble of random numbers and letters is to make it easier to note down correctly and leaves less room for human error. Not to mention, the vast number of seed word combinations makes it infeasible to try and crack it.  Why your seed phrase is important: The bottom line  If you lose access to your wallet or delete it without ensuring that your seed phrase is saved somewhere secure, you will lose access to your crypto assets. It is impossible to change your seed phrase, and there’s no one to reach out to to help you recover your seed phrase if the worst happens.  It’s highly recommended you don’t make a digital copy of your seed phrase. This means not sending it to yourself in an email or texting it to a friend. Some people use password managers to store their seed phrase, but that’s not foolproof, as hackers have successfully cracked weak passwords and gained access to all the passwords in a person’s vault, including seed phrases.  It’s best to take steps to ensure that your seed phrase is truly safe from harm’s way. Some like to transcribe their seed phrases onto pieces of metal, to prevent it from environmental factors that would destroy paper. If the seed phrase must be on paper, it would be ideal to store it somewhere especially secure, such as a bank deposit box or a fire-proof safe.

Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), who leads a subcommittee within the House of Representatives’ Natural Resources Committee, has recruited almost two dozen Democratic colleagues to urge federal environmental officials to devote further scrutiny to the consequences of cryptocurrency mining.  “We have serious concerns regarding reports that cryptocurrency facilities across the country are polluting communities and are having an outsized contribution to greenhouse gas emissions,” according to the letter, signed by lawmakers including Brad Sherman and Jamaal Bowman of California; Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York; and Jesús G. ""Chuy"" García and Marie Newman of Illinois. “People living near crypto mining facilities are already suffering the effects of air, water and noise pollution from these facilities.”  In the letter sent this week to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan, Huffman – also a member of the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis – praised President Joe Biden’s recent executive order calling for deeper understanding of crypto’s climate effects and supporting cleaner technologies.  “A single bitcoin transaction could power the average U.S. household for a month,” the lawmakers’ letter noted. “According to estimates by researchers, bitcoin produces annually carbon emissions comparable to Greece.”  The Democrats encouraged the further consideration of proof-of-stake mining technology as potentially having “99.99% lower energy demands” to validate transactions.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | MINING | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/04/21/us-house-democrats-call-for-scrutiny-on-crypto-mining-as-environmental-threat,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e3b36800e94941bae147b827f6c47baf81986e4c-3000x2582.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42395499,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASxWni,1650555556,Australia's Financial Regulator Aims to Implement Crypto Regulation by 2025,"The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has laid out a policy roadmap for the implementation of regulation for financial entities engaging in activity with crypto-assets.  Australia's financial regulator set a tentative goal of 2025 for its framework to be effective, in a letter by Chair Wayne Byres on Thursday.  To this end, APRA plans to conduct consultations on requirements for the financial treatment of crypto-assets, expected to be undertaken in 2023.  Regulation of stablecoins is also being considered by incorporating them into the existing framework for ""store-value facilities,"" a broad term for any non-cash facilities in which customers pre-pay money for future redemption. APRA also envisages consulting on this in 2023.  In addition, APRA intends to advance requirements for operational risk management when engaging in crypto activities in areas such as control effectiveness, business continuity and service provider management. A draft standard will be released in the next few months.  The regulator detailed its expectations for how entities manage risk around crypto-assets, asking them to ""apply robust risk management controls with clear accountabilities and relevant reporting."" Entities should have conducted a comprehensive risk assessment before engaging in crypto-asset activities and have plans in place to mitigate against risks associated with dealing in crypto.  APRA's statement comes as the market for crypto investment vehicles gathers pace in Australia. Earlier this week, exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuer 21Shares announced it will launch two spot ETFs next week, one investing directly in bitcoin (BTC) and the other in ether (ETH). They are the country's first spot exchange-traded products.  A study last year by comparison site Finder found Australians to be among the most enthusiastic adopters of crypto, with nearly 18% owning some. This compared to a global average of 11.4%.

Meanwhile, we can compartmentalize.”  N^2 also told CoinDesk that he is doxxed to Bastion investors but he prefers staying pseudonymous to the public in order to “focus on building the product with fewer distractions.”  Near ecosystem hype  The project says it plans to use the new funding towards hiring, marketing, business development and partnerships.

Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Bitcoin's ascent continues as Commerzbank revives hopes of faster mainstream crypto adoption.  Featured Story: Ether's implied volatility points to big move ahead.  And check out the CoinDesk TV show “First Mover,” hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern time.  Marc LoPresti, managing director, The Strategic Funds  Josh Hackbarth, head of NFT commercial development, Warner Bros  Alessio Quaglini, CEO, Hex Trust  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  Major cryptocurrencies traded higher, extending the three-day winning trend as reports of Commerzbank applying for a crypto license revived hopes of faster mainstream adoption of digital assets.  Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency by market value, topped $42,500, having found buyers under $40,000 early this week. Technical analysts foresee a continued rise toward the 200-day simple moving average located above $48,000.  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, rose to newly established resistance above $3,150. THETA, XMR and CAKE were other notable winners, boasting more than 6% gains on a 24-hour basis. 0x (ZRX), the native token behind the 0x protocol, rallied by more than 40% following an announcement that it will power Coinbase's NFT marketplace.  Germany's Commerzbank (CBK) applied for a crypto license earlier this year, a spokesperson for the bank said. That makes it the first major bank in Germany to move towards crypto adoption.  ""Despite retail being fearful and uninterested, institutional adoption continues as the second-largest listed bank in Germany, Commerzbank, has now applied for a local crypto license,"" Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at the U.K.-based digital asset broker Global Block said. ""This would allow it to provide exchange and crypto-asset services and become the first major bank in Germany to make this step.""  Mikkel Morch, executive director at crypto/digital asset hedge fund ARK36, said, ""We [are] now starting to see adoption even from some of the most conservative players in the banking field. These moves can be interpreted as the beginnings of a race within the traditional banking field to gain a competitive edge by being the first entity in its local market to offer crypto services.""  ""Inevitably, this will only speed up the adoption of crypto as a mainstream financial service. However, it also shows that the demand for it is already so high across the whole spectrum of banking clients that it compels entities that were previously hostile to crypto to completely change course,"" Morch added.  The continued interest from institutions and venture capital firms is what differentiates the current crypto bear market from the last one seen in 2018. Back then, traditional institutions stayed away from digital assets, and many people left crypto jobs and moved to conventional finance.  In traditional markets, futures tied to the S&P 500 signaled risk-on with a 0.6% gain. The dollar index dropped while the euro rose on hawkish comments by the European Central Bank members.  Traders cited European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde's speech and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's speech as the key events to watch out for. Both policymakers are scheduled to speak on Thursday at 15:00 UTC.  Hawkish comments may slow down bitcoin's ongoing ascent and the expected rise toward the 200-day average.

BitRiver's parent company is based in Switzerland and “has never provided services to Russian government institutions” or worked with entities already targeted by sanctions, Igor Runets, the company's CEO and founder, claimed to CoinDesk.  “These U.S. actions should obviously be viewed as interference in the crypto mining industry, unfair competition and an attempt to change the global balance of power in favor of American companies,” Runets added.  In its statement Wednesday, OFAC said that companies like BitRiver ""help Russia monetize its natural resources"" and added BitRiver and 10 subsidiaries to its list of specially designated nationals subject to sanctions.  Sanctions on Russia have been mounting as the U.S. and European Union bloc try to oppose its invasion of Ukraine. “As western sanctions tighten on Russia's energy sector, Russia will be increasingly incentivized to monetize its energy resources through mining,” David Carslisle, vice president of policy and regulatory affairs at blockchain analytics firm Elliptic, said in a statement said to CoinDesk.  Carlisle called the sanctions an “unprecedented action by OFAC” and a “a pre-emptive strike to prevent Russia from leveraging its energy resources for crypto-enabled sanctions evasion."" He noted that Iran has generated as much as $1 billion by mining bitcoin in the past, and ""OFAC is clearly intent on preventing Russia from following Iran's playbook.""  In neighboring and politically aligned Belarus, the government-run Minsk High Tech Park is considering allowing firms to settle payments in crypto, likely to avoid sanctions, a local industry insider told CoinDesk.  BitRiver is one of the largest bitcoin (BTC) mining hosts in Europe and operates six data centers, with another three under construction, its statement said.  The company plans to double its headcount in Russia to over 700 employees by the end of 2022, Runets said Thursday. BitRiver is known for its bitcoin mining centers in Siberia.  In its press release announcing BitRiver's inclusion, OFAC noted that BitRiver was founded in Russia in 2017 and currently operates out of three offices across the country. But in 2021 it shifted legal ownership of its assets to a Switzerland-based holding company.

Add the founders of MetaLend, a lending protocol for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that just raised $5 million in funding, to the list.  MetaLend co-founder Sudjeev Singh previously headed the growth and marketplace division for e-scooter company Bird. Co-founder Nikhil Bhardwaj oversaw a large engineering team at smart home security firm Ring.  “We are really excited about the direct impact we as builders will have on the space,” Bhardwaj told CoinDesk in an interview. “We’re at the forefront of it, and we’re really going to be able to influence what the future looks like.”  MetaLend’s new seed round was led by crypto investing giant Pantera Capital, which has $5.5 billion in assets under management. Participants in the round included crypto venture firm Collab+Currency and Vietnam-based gaming guild Ancient8, which is the first official guild partner of MetaLend.  The new capital will be used for product development, hiring and marketing efforts.  “MetaLend allows NFTs to be utilized and leveraged in a new way that brings value to the entire play-to-earn ecosystem,” Pantera Capital Partner Paul Veradittakit said in a press release. “As the use cases for NFTs grow, many will turn to protocols like MetaLend to access liquidity for their assets.”  Play-to-earn lending  MetaLend, which is currently in beta with a public launch planned for the second quarter, differs from some other NFT lenders in that players can keep playing and earning with the asset used as collateral.  The protocol had an initial focus on play-to-earn giant Axie Infinity but plans to integrate with a second, Polygon-based game within the next two to three months.  “If you think about it, what we’re doing is really beneficial to these games. You have a section of users who need liquidity and right now their only option is to sell out of their assets,” Singh told CoinDesk. “We provide that alternative, which is take on a loan instead and use the income from the NFT to pay that down over time.”  The MetaLend protocol lets users borrow up to 30% of the appraised value of an NFT in ETH. Over-collateralized loans are common in decentralized finance (DeFi) to help mitigate the risks of the underlying assets.

Ancient8 is the only official game guild partnership right now, but there are 10 to 15 other guilds sitting on the waitlist.  MetaLend loans don’t come from the protocol’s balance sheet, but rather originate from liquidity pools filled by outside lenders. The lenders earn interest on that money with MetaLend, expecting about 5% to 10% annual percentage yield.  If a borrower defaults on a loan, the NFT asset goes into a liquidation marketplace where people can buy the NFT at a discount. Game guilds are among the potential buyers, said Singh.",POSITIVE,ETH,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MINING | SPONSORED,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/21/bird-ring-veterans-raise-5m-for-gamefi-lending-protocol,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/19db1ac2661721d37fc6ee4e6c08323942d49883-3861x2574.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The next generation of internet users will likely vote with their feet when it comes to high-energy-consumption blockchain technology, and proof-of-stake chains like Algorand, Solana and Filecoin are becoming green favorites. But it should also be noted that lots of innovation is happening with Bitcoin in this regard.  In addition to a carbon-negative pledge in writing (made on Earth Day 2021), the approach is now part of the Algorand protocol itself, said Vice President of Engineering Research Naveed Ihsanullah.  “We decided to make our carbon-negative pledge forever with blockchain transparency and perpetual smart contracts,” Ihsanullah said in an interview. “A smart contract takes the parameters of the blockchain – how many relays are involved, how many nodes are involved, how many transactions, etc. – and comes up with the offset power that needs to be paid for, and then uses transaction fees to pay for that.”  Algorand is also planning to mark Earth Day on Friday with an audacious takeover of New York City’s Times Square, turning all its giant LED billboards green, and then switching them to darkness for an hour to make a point about energy consumption.  “We’re going to take an hour out of Times Square’s time to run this event. What’s really compelling is that one hour of shutdown will save somewhere around 6,500 kilowatt hours. That will be roughly equivalent to the power required to finalize 350 million transactions on the Algorand blockchain,” Ihsanullah said, adding:  “I think that’s something on the order of one and a half seconds of Bitcoin work.”  Read more: Algorand Rents Times Square Billboard to Tout Green Cred Ahead of Earth Day",POSITIVE,없음,ALGO | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIL | REGULATION,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/04/21/smart-offsets-algorand-ups-sustainability-pledge-with-self-executing-code,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/74bea65ef186791174dcbd7cb577ebfea35b48b6-2048x1036.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Valkyrie Multi-Coin Trust (VMCT) already has $15 million in commitments, Chief Investment Officer Steve McClurg told CoinDesk. Created in response to institutional demand (it’s only open to accredited investors) he said VCMT is generating inbounds from big banks and even insurance companies.  What they’re calling about is a bit more complicated than a passive buy-and-hold fund. VCMT is an actively managed, multi-protocol fund geared toward generating staking rewards – up to 6% a year.  “People have already made their money in Ethereum and they want the next thing,” McClurg said. “That's really what this represents.”  Other investment managers including Arca have previously launched yield-generating crypto products as the industry finds creative ways to generate returns in a sideways-trading market.  It opens with a basket of layer 1 tokens: avalanche (AVAX), binance (BNB), cosmos (ATOM), helium (HNT), terra (LUNA), polygon (MATIC) and zilliqa (ZIL). Monthly rebalances that McClurg said will be part “holistic,” part metrics-driven, could shake up the basket of baselayer tokens – minus ETH.  VMCT’s basket includes tokens from blockchains that reward holders who post their bags as collateral in securing the network, a process called proof-of-stake. Valkyrie runs part of this staking operation itself to reduce fees that reduce bottom-line yields.  Even the go-between dollar stablecoin generates returns, said McClurg. He said Valkyrie picked Gemini’s GUSD “because there’s a very attractive yield.”",POSITIVE,ATOM | AVAX | ETH | BNB,ATOM | AVAX | BUSINESS | ETH | BNB,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/21/institutional-goes-exotic-valkyries-multi-coin-trust-eyes-staking-rewards,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/67a22dcd42f0b86138fa54c8757864409c1cde97-2048x1536.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411808,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glg66M,1650545400,How to Spot Crypto Pump-and-Dump Schemes,"Digital assets are a frontier, and so it’s no surprise that they draw their share of outlaws.  When this story is shared on social media, inevitably a series of automated accounts, run by bots, will respond, share and retweet it to their followers, and in doing so, advertise a number of projects. While some of those projects will certainly be above-board with varying prospects for success, others will be fraud or scams.  In the bewildering world of cryptocurrencies, where it seems like a new product or strategy launches every minute, it can be very difficult to tell the difference.  But according to Adam Carlton, CEO of Pink Panda, a utility token for an intricately designed digital wallet, there’s one common scam that becomes very easy to recognize once we learn the signs: the pump-and-dump scheme.  The schemes  Pump-and-dump schemes exist throughout the investing universe, Carlton said, but because of the newness and popularity of digital assets, they are especially prevalent. In the scheme, holders of a low-value asset promote and “talk it up” to encourage others to buy and increase its price. When the price reaches a certain point, the orchestrators of the scheme sell, take their profits and fade away before the price drops, with later investors left holding the bag.  “There are two types that are the most prevalent right now. One is where insiders of the token are promoting it and stirring up all the hype while on the backside, they’re selling it slowly,” Carlton said. “The others target tokens and rally a group of that token community’s members to buy, which trigger algorithms, which trigger bots, who buy too, and whoever buys last and doesn’t sell is left holding the bag.”  The first type of scheme can happen in any sort of token, but the second typically targets smaller, less well-known tokens, whose prices are easier to pump up.  Read more: An Advisor’s Guide to Altcoin Investing  One telltale sign of a pump-and-dump scheme is copy-and-pasted messages by groups of social-media and discussion-group posters with similar screen names, who will often disappear at the culmination of their scheme with their anonymity intact.  “What I’m starting to see more of, especially in people overseas, is that they will doxx themselves (reveal their identity), say, ‘Here’s my credentials, and here’s what I’m doing,’” Carlton said.  “Then they do a big raise and never put that liquidity into their token,” he said. “So they’ll raise $1 million, but hold onto $800,000 or $900,000 of it and just kick the can down the road. They’re relying on the incredible attention deficit of people in this space who are looking for one-day buy-back returns – the expectations are incredibly short.”  One telltale sign of this kind of scheme is that the perpetrators will interact in channels populated by digital assets enthusiasts, like channels on the Discord messaging app, looking for their marks.  Carlton said there are still plenty of marks as people try to educate themselves about the digital assets market, and they make themselves clear by asking rudimentary questions.  The process  Every crypto pump-and-dump scheme follows the same basic template, Carlton said.  “The way they work is they create a token, and they want to take it as high as they can, so they go onto social media and talk about the things they are doing, they share memes and get people onto their channel,” Carlton said. “They first list some place like CoinGecko, then CoinMarketCap, and each listing expands them to a broader audience.”  When there are a lot of holders, the scam may start to advertise on buses and billboards, Carlton said, or use influencers to promote their token.  The next step is to appear on one or more of the big exchanges like Coinbase or Binance, opening up the token to an extremely broad audience.  Unlike the case in many forms of financial fraud, the idea isn’t to target a specific group of people, but to rope in as many as possible.  Key indicators  As we’ve already discussed, anonymous founders are usually a red flag for some form of illicit activity or fraud, though some perpetrators are now abandoning anonymity.  “It’s still an indicator, because if someone won’t tell you who they are, they’re doing it for a reason,” Carlton said. “Ninety-nine times out of 100, it is not because they have a strong belief in anonymity, it’s because they want to hide themselves from liability.”  If someone has revealed his identity, Carlton suggests that advisors and investors research that person. That includes looking up personal information as well as understanding the token that the person is issuing.  “As with anything financial, if it sounds too good to be true, it often is,” Carlton said. “I like to look for something specific – what exactly is the utility of this project, are they meeting their objectives, and are they using their community to share valid and useful information versus just pumping?  “Honestly, a lot can be gleaned from a token’s first few trading hours, oftentimes a scam will grow like it's the hottest thing on the exchange, and then everyone gets out very quickly.” Carlton said.  Keep an open mind  But a pump-and-dump scheme doesn’t happen just because a mass movement is inflating the price of a cryptocurrency. During the pandemic, the price of dogecoin – an altcoin that was invented as a parody of digital assets but that was rapidly adopted as a speculative investment – experienced a sudden and dramatic rise when Tesla founder Elon Musk, supported by social-media communities, voiced support for the token.  “If I was out there saying, ‘Buy my token, take it to the moon,’ I would be in trouble, and I’ve been advised by attorneys not to say these things,” Carlton said. “Regulations are gray-ish enough around crypto that nothing happened to Musk, and a lot of those who bought doge at a penny made money. But there were plenty of those who bought at 60 cents or 70 cents, and some of those people were our aunts and uncles and brothers and sisters, and they ended up losing a lot of money.”  Carlton believes that celebrity promotion of crypto should generally be considered a warning sign.  Crypto investing isn’t a zero-sum game, said Carlton. Just like in other asset classes, there can’t be winners achieving above-average returns without losers, and most investment schemers reap their profit by making people losers.",NEGATIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Christopher Robbins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/how-to-spot-crypto-pump-and-dump-schemes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b003dd795066d43be29870151d7bd07d5c2a04de-5012x3456.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The trading volumes during this tedious price fall was low and the price was looking for shelter and a reliable foothold to stop. Such a foothold was seen in January, when the MANA price jumped 90% up in two weeks. This was the result of a test of an important liquidity range of $1.8. https://www.tradingview.com/x/hDdZ3eQv/ In fact, from February 2022, sellers are trying to lower the MANA price again to $1.8, but these attempts still look pathetic. For maximum certainty about the feasibility of investing in the MANA cryptocurrency in the current price range, we should wait for the test of the lower trend line of the growth channel. In the event of an increase in trading volumes and the formation of pins down on the weekly timeframe, we will receive the final signal to buy MANA. The first target, where you can fix the return on investment is the mark of $3.54. On this mark, there is a liquidity range of sellers, which for the first time buyers may not be able to pass. However, after a local price rebound to $2.2, we expect the growth wave to continue with the next target of $5.4.

42395505,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASxWsd,1650543229,Morgan Stanley Says Crypto Could Become More Widely Used as Currency,"Few people use cryptocurrencies to pay for everyday goods because the transaction fees are high and merchants don’t accept crypto as payment, but that is changing, Morgan Stanley said in a research report Thursday.  The bank noted that payments company Strike recently announced a partnership with point-of-sales supplier NCR and payments firm Blackhawk Network, which means a large number of U.S. stores and restaurants will soon be able to accept bitcoin. Strike’s planned payment system uses the Lighting Network to process transactions, it added.  Morgan Stanley says partnerships with physical stores are a more important milestone in the “evolution of bitcoin usage as a medium of payment,” as over 85% of sales in the U.S. occur in shops rather than online.  The fee to send a bitcoin transaction using the Lightning Network is close to zero, which means it is more practical for making small payments that would normally be made using a debit card, the bank said.  The historical volatility of goods priced in bitcoin has also deterred the use of digital assets, but the ability of merchants to accept crypto, either through crypto cards or existing payment terminals, might lead to a fall in volatility in the digital asset, the bank posited.  Crypto is already widely used as a currency in the digital asset world, the report said, adding that ether is predominantly needed to buy non-fungible tokens (NFTs). As more brands look to advertise in the metaverse, there could be an increasing need to accept a range of payment methods, including crypto, it said.  NFTs are digital assets on a blockchain that represent ownership of virtual or physical items that can be sold or traded.

42395513,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASxX2T,1650542976,"Limitless Launches 'Metaverse as a Service,' Plans $60M Venture Fund","The Next Earth metaverse platform has created a replica of the earth with about 5 trillion tiles and minted non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to let users buy pieces of that virtual land.  The project also started a formal business to offer metaverse-as-a-service and launched a $60 million venture fund to build the digital globe.  Since its launch last July, Next Earth said it has attracted more than 230,000 registered users, 45,000 landowners and over $10 million in revenue.  By comparison, The Sandbox, a metaverse platform that is owned by venture capital and gaming software firm Animoca Brands, hit 2 million registered users last month.  With a fresh development push, Next Earth represents one of several novel approaches to capitalizing on metaverse mania.  Limitless will have two arms: Limitless Capital, a venture fund that plans to raise $60 million to invest in startups interested in joining Next Earth, and Limitless Network, which will launch an application programming interface (API) in the coming months to help projects join Next Earth.  Limitless could also offer its back-end metaverse technology to large companies looking to build independent metaverses.  Read more: A MetaMask Founding Architect Is Building an Interoperable ‘MetaMetaverse’  “I think that most metaverse [projects] are just trying to recreate Second Life,” Limitless co-CEO David Taylor told CoinDesk in an interview, referring to a popular metaverse game in the 2000s. “Instead of doing that, we’re going to create a middleware layer for the metaverse. Through our API connections, any business small or large can connect to Next Earth.”  Taylor will share the reins as Limitless CEO with Mike Vitez, who also serves as IT director for Next Earth.  NXTT token  Next Earth released its own utility token, NXTT, at the end of January, which now has a self-reported market cap of $181 million, according to CoinMarketCap. The token and NFT capital could self-fund the $60 million venture capital fund, said Taylor, who served as Next Earth’s token architect. Next Earth, however, would rather build out its network through outside investors.  “If we are to believe that the metaverse is an industry that is currently being born … then we need to enable network effects through a bunch of investors into our ecosystem,” Taylor said.  Limitless is assembling the management team for the venture fund with plans to launch the vehicle by September.  He said Limitless is also forming an idea for a future $200 million NXTT token fund to back companies that want to join Next Earth without having their own tokens. The idea is the companies could launch using the native token and the fund would match those earnings.  “We see that the big battle of the market is not between us and The Sandbox or Decentraland. The big battle is between Web 2 and Web 3,” Taylor said, adding:  “We are focused on making all Web 3 metaverses interoperable. And onboarding companies to the Next Earth metaverse is step one of that.”  UPDATE (April 21, 14:33 UTC): Changes headline, adds clarity throughout.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MANA | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/21/next-earth-launches-metaverse-as-a-service-plans-60m-venture-fund,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a04fed488241303c3ad9db95f503d1bb19ef4a59-4204x3265.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42395517,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASxX6P,1650539134,"Bitcoin Investors Eye 200-Day Average After Three-Day Rally, Analyst Says","Bullish signals for bitcoin have emerged, favoring a continued price rally toward the widely tracked 200-day simple moving average (SMA), according to a technical analysis by Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies.  The daily chart shows the leading digital asset has risen from $38,500 to $42,200 in the past three days, defending the Ichimoku cloud support.  Created by Japanese journalist Goichi Hosoda in the late 1960s, the Ichimoku cloud comprises two lines – the leading span A and the leading span B. Both are plotted 26 days ahead of the last candle. The indicator is widely used to identify support and resistance, with crossovers above or below representing an advance warning of bullish or bearish breakouts.  The latest bullish defense is backed by positive signals from technical tools like stochastics and MACD (moving average convergence/divergence) histograms.  ""Bitcoin held important cloud-based support near $40,000 and has generated an oversold 'buy' signal from the daily stochastics after a three-day rally, supporting a short-term bullish bias,"" Stockton said in an email. ""The daily MACD is pinched as well, reflecting improved short-term momentum that supports a move higher toward next resistance near $48.1K, defined by the 200-day MA.""  In technical analysis, stochastics are indicators that oscillate between 0 and 100, helping traders identify oversold and overbought conditions and trade entry and exit points. An asset is considered to be oversold when stochastics drop under 20 and overbought when they top 80. A turn higher from under 20 is taken as a buy signal.  The MACD histogram is used to identify trend changes and trend strength. The indicator's positive/negative flips indicate bullish/bearish trend changes. Meanwhile, the ""pinch"" – declining bars or lower highs above the zero line and higher lows below the zero line represent bullish and bearish exhaustion.  The three-day rise has brought the 200-day SMA of $48,000 into focus. In late March, the average proved a tough nut to crack, stalling the recovery rally from lows near $37,500.  On the downside, Monday's low of $38,550 is the level to beat for the sellers.

In a VentureBeat report, Goldman said his new fund will focus “mostly on VR gaming” but also the metaverse. The fund is named after the Tower 26 lifeguard tower in Venice, California.  Goldman said blockchain games are “interesting,” but it won’t be the primary focus of the fund.  Goldman was the founder of Foundation 9 Entertainment, which created games based on “Star Wars,” “The Matrix,” “The Simpsons” and “Lord of the Rings”.  This is the second gaming fund for Goldman after the GC Tracker Fund, which was a $15 million fund for seed investments in gaming VR and AR.  The GC Tracker Fund launched in the early days of VR gaming, and most of the companies in the fund did not survive the “trough of disillusionment” after VR failed to take off in 2016.  Goldman said that only 30% of the VR fund is still viable.

The bank is more positive on VR than AR because usable products already exist and it expects development of more hardware in the near term.  The “main race” for VR is between Apple (AAPL) and Meta (FB), the report said. Apple is likely striving for an extension to its ecosystem, and Meta is looking to build a base of users through “attractive hardware pricing and compelling experiences,” it said.  Still, while VR platform technology is getting better, the category has until now “failed to resonate with a broad base of users,” Goldman said.  VR platforms are set to evolve quickly into 2023, and sales of these products will depend on the amount of utility that consumers derive from their use, the note said, adding that VR could become an integral part of remote working if some issues, such as comfort, are resolved.  The bank expects Meta Platforms to launch its Quest Pro product this fall, and Apple to launch its own product in early 2023.  The use of AR is likely to remain limited to costly industrial focused applications for the foreseeable future, the report added.

The two chief executives discussed Goldman Sachs advising FTX, which was valued at $32 billion in January, on future funding rounds and taking a role in a potential initial public offering (IPO), according to the report, which cited people familiar with the matter.  Solomon also offered Goldman Sachs's advice to FTX in discussions with regulators in the U.S. FTX filed a proposal with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in March that would allow it to directly clear trades of its derivatives customers. The regulator will give the proposal an informal hearing on May 23.  The two also discussed collaborating on market making in crypto trades. Market making involves setting buy and sell prices on certain assets to facilitate trades and provide liquidity.  The discussions demonstrate the increasing interest mainstream financial institutions are taking in the crypto industry after Goldman Sachs led the initial public offering (IPO) of crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) last year.

The company originally implemented a monthly fee of $29, which was dropped last year and now only charges a 1% buy/sell transaction fee on crypto transactions. Since iTrustCapital&apos;s inception four years prior, the firm has attracted more than 35,000 clients with its crypto IRAs. In January 2022, the company completed a Series A round at a valuation over $1.3 billion. The proceeds are being used to expand products and services, scale client service and development teams, and launch additional marketing channels. In the United States, IRAs enable individuals to save for retirement through tax-free capital accumulation or on a tax-deferred basis. For instance, those with IRAs do not need to pay taxes on asset capital gains held within these accounts but may need to pay taxes on withdrawals when they reach retirement age.The post Crypto Retirement Accounts Provider iTrustCapital Surpasses $5B in IRA Transactions first appeared on Cryptoknowmics-Crypto News and Media Platform.The post Crypto Retirement Accounts Provider iTrustCapital Surpasses $5B in IRA Transactions appeared first on Cryptoknowmics-Crypto News and Media Platform.",POSITIVE,없음,REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/crypto-retirement-accounts-provider-itrustcapital-surpasses-5b-in-ira-transactions/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=crypto-retirement-accounts-provider-itrustcapital-surpasses-5b-in-ira-transactions,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

It aims to increase the utility of Terra’s UST stablecoins through a partnership with Frax and Redacted Cartel, a tool for earning yields on locked tokens.  Curve data show the 4pool on Fantom has already locked up $31 million in value hours after launch, with over $2.4 million in traded volume. The pool is paying out daily yields of nearly 0.5%, the data shows. The pool was created after a governance vote on Curve.  Data shows the pool holds $9.7 million in FRAX, $8.4 million in USDC, $4.9 million in Terra’s UST stablecoin, and $7.9 million in tether (USDT).  4pool will initially be tested on the Fantom and Arbitrum networks, and later on Ethereum, according to its developers, with its creators aiming to make it one of the most liquid trading pools on Curve. Curve remains the biggest decentralized finance platform on Ethereum with over $21 billion in value locked.  Pools currently deployed on Curve are backed by centralized or decentralized stablecoins, wrapped tokens – such as wrapped bitcoin – or a basket of various assets.  4pool, however, will bring together UST and FRAX, the two largest decentralized stablecoins, with a cumulative backing of over $19.6 billion, and USDT and USDC, the two largest centralized stablecoins, with a cumulative backing of $133 billion. This would make it one of the most liquid decentralized pools within the crypto ecosystem.  Meanwhile, Frax Finance founder Sam Kazemian said in a message to CoinDesk that projects interested in the 4pool would receive operational support from the protocol.  “FRAX and Terra look forward to supporting all the projects that use 4Pool for their stablecoin yield & liquidity needs,” Kazemian said.",POSITIVE,USDT | USDC,ETH | LUNA | MARKET | USDT | USDC,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/04/21/frax-terra-backed-4pool-goes-live-on-fantom-network-attracts-31m,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

This makes it the first major bank in Germany to move towards crypto adoption.  A bank spokesperson said Commerzbank wants to help shape emerging digital ecosystems, especially with regard to custody and trading in non-physical assets.  “To this end, we entered into a cooperation with Deutsche Börse and Fin-Tech 330x in spring 2021. In addition, we are pursuing our own digital asset strategy and are also planning our own offerings for our customers in the coming years. We have applied for a license from the Bafin for the safekeeping of crypto assets. The future offer is initially aimed at institutional customers,” said Bernd Reh, senior spokesman, Commerzbank.  Local media outlet Börsen-Zeitung first reported that a spokesperson from the bank confirmed on April 14 that it “applied for the crypto custody license in the first quarter of 2022.”  The application is to get authorization to offer exchange services along with custody and protection of crypto-assets.  Commerzbank is Germany’s second-largest listed bank and is partly owned by the government.  Germany had brought in a new law, effective Jan. 1, 2020, that would encourage German banks to offer crypto services. The law required any business seeking to offer crypto services in Germany to seek a license from BaFin, Germany's Federal Financial Supervisory Authority.

In its latest round of sanctions, the U.S. Treasury Department says that it is taking action against companies in Russia&apos;s crypto mining industry and added Bitriver and 10 subsidiaries, saying the companies &apos;operated in the technology sector&apos; of Russia&apos;s economy. &apos;Russia has a comparative advantage in crypto mining due to energy resources and a cold climate.

Despite weakness, the coin may rally towards Q1 2022 highs once there is a comprehensive close above $17.1. Past Performance The NEAR price is steady around March 2022 highs and relatively firm in the past trading week. Overall, buyers appear to be in the driving seat, rejecting bear attempts to force prices below immediate critical support lines. As per the formation in the daily chart, NEAR bulls may breeze above $19.8 and troop higher in a buy trend continuation. Near Protocol Technical Analysis NEAR is up 133 percent from 2022 lows and resilient against bears. The rejection of lower prices in the course of last week and the resurgence on April 19 points to strength. Therefore, risk-off traders may load on dips at spot rates as long as prices are above $16.1 and the middle BB targets at $20.3—Q1 2022 highs. On a more conservatory approach, risk-on traders may wait for a clean break above $17.1 and March 2022 before doubling down with targets at January 2022 highs. What to Expect from the Near Protocol?

The company will use the new funds to expand its “Digital Flare Mitigation” technology across the U.S. and internationally, as well as launch a new cloud computing platform, called CrusoeCloud, where energy-intensive High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems will be powered by flare gas and renewable energy sources. CrusoeCloud will be launched publicly later this year, Lochmiller said.  Crusoe, which recently was recognized for its “innovative” solution to generating energy by the World Bank’s Global Gas Flaring Reduction Initiative report, has several mobile sites across the U.S.  Crusoe’s customers includehttps://ca.style.yahoo.com/crusoe-achieves-operational-milestones-closes-130000071.html Devon Energy (DVN), Kraken Oil & Gas, Canadian oil firm Enerplus (ERF) and others. Notably, Crusoe is reportedly working on a pilot project with Exxon (XOM) to use flared gas at the energy giant’s North Dakota oil wells to power bitcoin mining operations.  In the flaring process, excess natural gas is burned off into the atmosphere as part of oil drilling operations; it has become standard industry practice because of the lack of transportation infrastructure. The process is under environmental scrutiny, however, and U.S. President Joe Biden has pledged to cut methane emissions from oil and gas operations.  ESG push  Using flared gas to mine digital assets has emerged as a popular trend among both the crypto mining and energy industries.  The process helps energy companies reduce their flaring footprint, as a plan to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 laid out by the International Energy Agency (IEA) would require all non-emergency flaring to be eliminated globally by 2030. Meanwhile, crypto miners and data centers, which use tremendous amounts of energy, are able to source cheap and sustainable energy for their operations.  “If you’re utilizing energy that’s going to just go into waste anyway, you might as well use it,” Valkyrie Chief Investment Officer Steven McClurg told CoinDesk. Adding that he is “a big fan” of using flared natural gas, when asked if this source of energy is among the best sustainable energy used by miners.  Valkyrie launched a bitcoin miners exchange-traded fund earlier this year, which invests 80% of its net assets in miners that derive a minimum of 50% of their profit from bitcoin mining and primarily use renewable energy.  ‘Clear leader’  The funding comes at a time when capital markets for crypto miners have somewhat dried up and miners are getting creative in raising capital for their growth, including leveraging their existing mining rigs and mined bitcoins to secure debt.  “This capital will enable Crusoe to deploy Digital Flare Mitigation at greater scale, to use its solution to accelerate renewable energy deployment, and to continue innovating its industry-leading technology,"" said Ben Kortlang, partner at G2 Venture. “After a deep dive into flare mitigation and modular data center technologies, we concluded that Crusoe is the clear leader in scale, operational excellence, talent, vision and proven commitment to environmental standards.”  Read more: Bitcoin Miner Crusoe Mostly Not Affected by North Dakota Oil Site Explosion  Crusoe raised $128 million in Series B financing in April last year, led by Valor Equity Partners.  The new raise would be among one of the largest funding rounds for a privately held crypto mining company. In February, Compute North, a provider of sustainable infrastructure for cryptocurrency mining, closed a $385 million round that includes an $85 million Series C fundraise and $300 million debt financing. Another private miner, GEM Mining raised $200 million in institutional capital in December.  Meanwhile, among publicly traded miners, Riot Blockchain (RIOT) filed a prospectus in April for the ongoing sale of up to $500 million in shares, otherwise known as an “at-the-market” (ATM) offering.  A laundry list of investors joined Crusoe’s Series C.  Returning investors include Valor Equity Partners, Polychain Capital, Bain Capital Ventures, Winklevoss Capital and more.

The first iteration of the internet was Web 1, which rolled out in the 1990s. It introduced the age of interconnection of computers globally. It was closely followed by Web 2 in 2002/2003.

The BSTN token will trade on Trisolaris, a decentralized exchange on Near’s Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible layer Aurora, beginning 23:59 UTC (7:59 p.m. ET) on Thursday, April 21.  Bastion is a lending, borrowing and exchange protocol that launched in March as a fork of the popular Ethereum-based DeFi protocol Compound.  “We’re able to double the utility of the protocol while using the same amount of liquidity by re-using deposit receipt tokens,” pseudonymous Bastion founder N^2 (“Near Squared”) told CoinDesk in an interview. “No other DeFi protocol has done this.”  Within the span of several weeks, Bastion has grown to about $620 million in total value locked (TVL), according to Bastion founder N^2.  However, data provider DeFiLlama has the protocol at $507 million in TVL, a figure N^2 says omits the $110 million in its exchange protocol.  Regardless, DeFi Llama has Bastion as the largest DeFi protocol on the Near blockchain.  BSTN token  Bastion will be allocating 5 billion BSTN tokens at a $180 million valuation, according to pitch deck materials shared with CoinDesk. The initial circulating supply will be around 12.6%, or about 630 million tokens.  Bastion’s new token will give holders governance rights, including input into the development of the protocol and the ability to vote on fee models, gauges and staking in a decentralized manner.  Approximately 15% of the 5 billion total tokens will go to investors and 25% will go to team members and advisors. In addition, 30% of the tokens will be set aside for liquidity mining incentives and 30% for the protocol’s treasury.  Eligible users who pre-mined on Bastion or participated in Bastion’s lockdrop IDO will be able to claim their BSTN airdrop on the token’s launch day.  Holders of the BSTN token will be able to earn yield on their tokens by providing liquidity on Aurora’s decentralized exchange Trisolaris and also stake their BSTN tokens in the Bastion app or Aurora Realm, Bastion’s isolated lending market for Aurora ecosystem assets.  The Near ecosystem grows  Near has become one of the hottest layer 1 blockchain projects in recent weeks, with its NEAR token gaining 48% in the past month, according to data from Messari.  Bastion’s rapid growth comes as the core pieces of DeFi infrastructure are being built out on Near. Near, which boasts fewer projects than competing layer 1s such as Ethereum, Avalanche, Solana or Luna, has yet to see a DeFi project hit the $1 billion TVL milestone.  Additionally, speculation over the launch of a Near-native USN stablecoin is further building anticipation of a DeFi renaissance on the blockchain.  Bastion raised $2 million last month in its seed round and is backed by ParaFi Capital, Digital Currency Group (CoinDesk’s parent company), CMS and Jane Street.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | AIRDROP,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/21/near-based-defi-protocol-bastion-to-launch-bstn-token-at-a-180m-valuation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d1bb7b7735b0b63feb6dd372fc05d0e919048751-1024x611.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
