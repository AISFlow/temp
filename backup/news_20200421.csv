John Roth left the crypto exchange for the Washington, D.C.-based mortgage finance giant last month, according to his LinkedIn page. He is now director of legal and regulatory compliance at Fannie, formed during the Great Depression to buy and insure home loans for banks and has been operating under government conservatorship since the 2008 financial crash. Fannie buys or guarantees about a quarter of all single-family mortgages written in the U.S., according to its last annual report.      Roth’s LinkedIn profile no longer identifies Bittrex as a previous employer, only a nameless ""digital currency exchange startup.""      ""We are grateful for John's contribution to Bittrex. In two and a half years, after building Bittrex’s compliance team from the ground up, John announced he was taking on another role,"" a company spokesperson told CoinDesk. Neither Roth nor Fannie answered requests for comment by press time.    Run-in with New York    Roth’s tenure at Bittrex was marked by controversy. In April 2019 the New York Department of Financial Services rejected the exchange's application for a so-called BitLicense, leading the company to later close off business for Empire State residents. Pushback from the company led to an unusual move by the regulator, which opted to explain the deficiencies of Bittrex's application in an op-ed on CoinDesk.      The denial letter from the state went into detail about what it saw as Bittrex’s shortcomings in preventing money laundering and sanctions violations and appeared to specifically criticize Roth.      “Bittrex’s current policies and procedures are either non-existent or inadequate,” NYDFS said in the letter, questioning the “experience, level of authority and effectiveness of the Compliance Officer” without naming him.      Before joining Bittrex in December 2017, Roth worked in government service, dating back to stints at two different U.S. Attorney's offices through the 1990s. He also served at the Department of Justice and as inspector general at the Department of Homeland Security, and was a senior counsel to the bipartisan 9/11 Commission, which investigated the circumstances leading to the terrorist attacks.      Other crypto pros to rejoin the public sector include Brian Brooks, former Coinbase chief legal officer, who went to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a banking regulator; and Dorothy DeWitt, also formerly of Coinbase, now working at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's Division of Market Oversight.    In flux    Bittrex Chief Operating Officer James Waschak is running the compliance team until a successor for Roth is found.      The leadership team was already in flux before Roth’s departure. Founder Bill Shihara is on a roughly six-month sabbatical from his role as CEO while co-founder Richie Lai manages day-to-day operations. Shihara remains active as chairman of the board.      While typically understood as one company, Bittrex is technically three entities, an exchange for users in the United States, one for the rest of the world and a technology company that serves both, according to a spokesperson at Bittrex Global (the aforementioned worldwide exchange).      There was also a leadership transition at Bittrex Global in February. Kiran Raj stepped down as CEO, serving elsewhere within the company, according to a spokesperson. Tom Albright, former general counsel, now leads the exchange for the world outside the U.S. Bittex Global COO Stephen Stonberg added the duties of chief financial officer.      Founded in 2013 by Shihara and others, Bittrex is ranked 18th among exchanges on CoinGecko; it saw $24 million in trading volume over the last 24 hours, as of this writing.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/21/bittrex-exec-joins-mortgage-giant-fannie-mae-after-crypto-exchanges-brush-with-nydfs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3bfd29232dea695d505f49ab7efc37f80b815a8a-1334x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431781,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN6Phh,1587504741,"Market Wrap: Oil in Turmoil, Bitcoin Gains Slightly to $6.9K","Crude’s turmoil continues to shake global markets. Prices on West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil futures for expiring June sank 43 percent to $12 per barrel on Tuesday. This comes one day after May WTI contract prices plunged into negative territory - as low as -$40 per barrel at one point - for the first time ever. It closed the trading day at $11.57 per barrel.      European stocks felt the impact first, with the FTSE Eurotop 100 index closing down 3.6 percent. Energy companies such as BP and Shell, as well as mining stocks dragged down market performance.      President Trump tweeted Tuesday a promise to bail out oil companies with stimulus. Nonetheless, the S&P 500 index slipped 3.1 percent by the end of the trading day.      “In the coming weeks, the WTI future price will continue to be under pressure until global economic activity picks up again, particularly in the major oil consuming countries of the U.S. and China, or OPEC+ eases production cuts,” said Nemo Qin, senior analyst at multi-asset brokerage eToro.      Analysts are predicting numerous possibilities as a result of the oil market’s chaos. It seems to some that crypto, at least for the time being, is acting steadier than crude oil.      See also: Negative Oil Prices Could Hurt Bitcoin Miners Who Use Flared Gas      “Today BTC and some cryptocurrencies look like better stores of value than oil,” said Piers Ridyard, CEO of Radix, a decentralized ledger software for asset-backed tokens. “The BTC price today is virtually flat compared to the start of the year and has lost 30% of its value since its 2020 peak in early February. In comparison WTI Oil has lost 457 percent of its value versus 2020 peaks.”    Crypto markets    The price of bitcoin climbed by less than 1 percent over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index as of 21:00 UTC (5:00 p.m. EDT) Tuesday.      Bitcoin began its trading day at midnight UTC April 21 around $6,800. By 12:00 UTC (8 a.m. EDT), the price for one BTC was slightly lower at about $6,700. However, a large amount of buying on spot exchanges like Coinbase took place to hours later, pushing bitcoin into $6,900 territory.      The global health crisis continues to factor into digital asset prices. Concern over the coronavirus is causing bitcoin mining troubles, says Adam Vettese, U.K. market analyst at multi-asset brokerage eToro.      “COVID-19 is having varying impacts on mining projects around the world, with operations in Canada having been deemed ‘essential’ and permitted to continue, yet in places like Argentina they have been shut down,” he noted. “It comes as the space as a whole is being squeezed by the upcoming halving event, with many operations relying on a price spike to assist with paying off big hardware bills.”      Profit margins for miners, of course, depend on bitcoin prices. After those prices collapsed on March 12 with $700 million in liquidations on derivatives exchange BitMEX, the hash rate dropped to as low as 94 million terahashes per second. That was roughly where it was inDecember 2019. The hash rate is a measure of operations done by all the mining machines in the Bitcoin network.      Bitcoin’s mining hashrate has been climbing back since mid-March, yet still hasn’t reached the 123 million terahash per second high prior to the crypto price collapse. Hashrate will continue to be something to watch in the cryptocurrency markets as the halving approaches in mid-May, reducing the reward for miners for successfully mining a block by 50 percent.      “There needs to be an elevator pitch for why the halving actually increases the value of bitcoin,” said Henrik Kugelberg, a Sweden based over-the-counter (OTC) trader. “What if gold mining was halved globally and we discovered that all the gold is almost mined? What if no more oil fields were discovered?”      Other digital assets are mixed on CoinDesk’s big board for the day, mostly down or flat. Ether climbed less than a percent. The biggest loser is lisk (LSK), in the red 2.5 percent. On the other side, stellar (XLM) is up 1.5 percent and eos (EOS) is in the green 1.2 percent. All price changes are as of 21:00 UTC (5:00 p.m. EDT) Tuesday.    Other markets    Gold saw a modest decline Tuesday, falling a little under 1 percent to $1,679 over the course of the past 24 hours, though at one point it traded as low as $1,659.90 during New York’s morning trading.      Asia’s Nikkei 225 dropped 1.9 percent as concerns about the health of North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un after surgery was the topic of the day during Tokyo trading hours.      U.S. Treasury bonds continue to see a rally as money flees to safety. Yields, which move opposite to price, on the 30-year, 10-year and two-year bond all fell on Tuesday.

42431777,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN6Pdh,1587502871,Bitcoin Can't Be a Safe Haven and 100x Leverage Is the Reason Why,"Vishal Shah is founder of Alpha5, a new bitcoin derivatives exchange backed by Polychain Capital.      Despite some championing, it is clear bitcoin is stilla risky asset on a peripheral investment frontier, and not a safe haven at all.      Bitcoin is simply not going to be a primary concern for capital swimming around in traditional markets. Remember, this is a time when assets like U.S. equities are enduring unprecedented volatility. There would need to be a return to frothy markets and the comeback of marginal greed to see more institutional players wandering inside the crypto gates.      See also: As This Crisis Worsens, Bitcoin Will Become a Safe Haven Again      You might think macro developments such as profligate money printing would give bitcoin a reasonable investment thesis. But that is not manifesting, and for good reason. The ecosystem around bitcoin is limiting its own long-term prosperity. Topping the list of ailments is bitcoin volatility, which is artificially created by high-leverage.    The data on volatility does not lie    With the crypto options market becoming more entrenched over the past year, it’s possible to observe a pattern in bitcoin volatility. There hasn’t been a sustained meaningful premium of implied volatility (the market’s forecast of the likely movement of price), over realized volatility. Bitcoin’s implied volatility rarely dips below 50 percent. In fact, bitcoin enjoys a rather patterned ""vol of vol,"" whereby implied and realized volatility move almost rhythmically together, fluctuating between 40 percent and above a 200 percent ceiling.      An asset like bitcoin that over the course of years sustains an implied volatility of over 50 percent is truly remarkable. For comparison, stocks with a sustained volatility of even 25 are often classified as high-beta (meaning they outperform the market when it’s going up but fall precipitously when it's going down).      So what is it that plagues bitcoin to create such outsized moves? Well, the biggest problem is the extreme amount of leverage in crypto derivative markets.    Sheer silliness on derivative platforms    As they try to increase adoption, cryptocurrency derivative trading platforms deal with a very unique situation. Bitcoin holdings are heavily concentrated, with 95 percent of physical supply owned by a relatively small number of addresses. At the same time, a great many traders on these platforms have a very strong appetite for risk. That is the short story of why 100 times (100x) leverage is now commonplace in crypto markets. There is a need to cater to the demands for rapid “financialization” of concentrated holdings.      Leverage at 100x margin is attractive (at least superficially) to an investor looking to reduce capital requirements while increasing exposure. Regulated exchanges offer approximately 3.5x leverage onshore. But an apple-to-apple comparison is misleading; on- and offshore markets are different.      Firstly, many offshore crypto exchanges act not only as a trading venue, but also as clearer and custodian – a complete vertical integration orchestrated by a company registered on a small island somewhere. This is versus the siloed and “arms’-length” functions in more regulated environments. Ultimately, this puts a huge amount of responsibility, and tremendous power, in the hands of offshore exchanges.    Unless and until exchanges take it upon themselves to fix this problem, bitcoin won’t mature from being a gyrating toy into an asset of real interest for traditional market players.    To offer 100x leverage, typically accompanied with a 0.50 percent maintenance margin (the amount of equity an account must sustain to keep its current positions and orders), is antithetical to the pursuit of orderly cryptocurrency market functions. In fact, it is probably the single largest contributor to sustained volatility.    Bad Infrastructure    Adding fuel to the fire is that most of these leveraged exchanges are not built to handle concentrated volume at scale during times of high stress. Queuing and server overloads have become all too common, ironically just when markets tend to explode in trading volume.      This impedes traders from reducing their exposure, leaving them to the mercy of aggressive liquidation algorithms (when price points trigger automatic position closures), whose successes are fingerprinted on exchanges’ insurance funds. The insurance funds of crypto exchanges act both as an outward image of the exchange's success, but also as a measure of how aggressive and damaging their liquidation algorithms are to their trading community. That is because on almost every exchange, the insurance fund is capitalized from liquidation of traders' positions.      On some exchanges, once an account breaches the maintenance margin threshold – the price at which the account is in violation of minimum margin requirements to sustain its open orders and positions – a limit order is placed at the bankruptcy price to liquidate the position. On other trading platforms, liquidations are done in batches, with a fee charged for each partially completed order. In this fashion, the trading position is liquidated slowly, and there is a chance that they could be ""pumped"" back to life if the market is to recover. In any instance, as a direct consequence of 100x leverage and small balances of equity, orderly executions have very tight windows within which to operate.    Unwinding the leverage game    Stigmatic levels of volatility associated with bitcoin are not inevitable. They are man-made. A reduction of leverage would alleviate the stress on liquidation engines. What is often lost in the fascination with high leverage is that 100x leverage creates a situation where any maintenance margin threshold – which will have to be less than 1 percent, and is often 0.50 percent – will simply not leave enough room for liquidation algorithms to be effective.      For this reason, it would be wise to reduce leverage broadly available across the ecosystem to stop this ridiculous volatility. Even 25x with a 2 percent maintenance margin supplemented with a more sophisticated liquidation engine would be more equitable to traders.      There needs to be a concerted and deliberate effort to reduce leverage and increase maintenance margin by the largest venues. Unless and until exchanges take it upon themselves to fix this problem, bitcoin won’t mature from being a gyrating toy into an asset of real interest for traditional market players.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,Vishal Shah,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/21/bitcoin-cant-be-a-safe-haven-and-100x-leverage-is-the-reason-why,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d8f8db45c910cca2fe4187519bdd125713087e21-1780x1188.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Hundreds of people (including some of you) have been hurt, yet big tech continues to drag their feet,"" he said.      According to the suit, Ripple alleges the scammers have successfully defrauded ""millions of XRP valued at hundreds of thousands of dollars"" out of victims. It cited at least one instance where a scammer apparently received $15,000 in XRP from a victim.      ""Ripple has repeatedly demanded that YouTube take action to stop the Scam and prevent further harm. Yet YouTube refuses, even where the same scheme is replicated time and again on its platform. YouTube’s response has been woefully inadequate and incomplete. As a result, Ripple and Mr. Garlinghouse continue to suffer substantial reputational harm,"" the suit said.      Ripple sent at least 25 takedown notices against accounts promoting such giveaways, but YouTube failed to act promptly, the suit alleges.      Among the allegations, Ripple says the Google subsidiary assists the scammers disseminate ads, and profits off of this revenue: ""YouTube, after it was informed about the Scam on countless occasions, sold and helped the scammers disseminate advertisements—so-called “video discovery ads”—to get more YouTube visitors to view and click on videos perpetuating the Scam.""      The suit asks a federal court to compel YouTube to shut down any alleged scams which use Ripple's registered trademarks to promote such giveaways, to be more proactive in shutting down future alleged scams, to stop verifying any such alleged scams, and for damages, restitution, costs and interest.      ""The Court should compel YouTube to fulfill its legal obligations, to discontinue its policy of willful inaction, and to prevent further irreparable harm to Ripple’s brand and Mr. Garlinghouse’s reputation, which, in turn, will prevent further financial injury to the individuals who are duped by the Scam. Absent a court order obligating YouTube to act, the Scam will undoubtedly continue to flourish and create countless more victims,"" the suit said.      Ripple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A YouTube spokesperson told CoinDesk ""We take abuse of our platform seriously, and take action quickly when we detect violations of our policies, such as scams or impersonation"" in an emailed statement.

42431767,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN6PHh,1587498053,'Long Bitcoin' It Ain't: Crypto Traders Make Sense of Renaissance Filing,"Bitcoin, the asset class, received some heavyweight hedge fund validation last week when a regulatory filing revealed New York-based Renaissance Technologies is considering including cash-settled bitcoin futures among the instruments it trades.      Renaissance, arguably the world’s most secretive and successful money manager, did not respond to requests for comment.      Still, it’s interesting to hear how trading experts think a firm like Renaissance might approach bitcoin as an underlying asset, given the hedge fund’s reputation for using mind-bending math to identify patterns and anomalies across a universe of assets.      Read more: $166B Asset Manager Renaissance Eyes Bitcoin Futures for Flagship Fund      Prize-winning mathematician James Simons began Renaissance Technologies (originally called Monemetrics) in a Long Island strip mall in 1978. Renaissance is now famous for pioneering data science and machine learning before these disciplines went mainstream, and has been described as having the best physics and mathematics department in the world.      Highlighting the complexity of the fund’s approach, Max Boonen, the founder of digital assets trading platform B2C2, referred to a famous quote attributed to former Renaissance chief Robert Mercer, who said the firm was unable to make sense of some of its most profitable trading signals.      “Renaissance can make predictions based on pure time-series data and they don't necessarily have to have a strong economic rationale for why a signal works or doesn't work,” said Boonen. “In fact, such an approach might be quite appropriate for Bitcoin at the stage that it is. Because it’s sometimes very difficult to make sense of the moves in the Bitcoin market.”    ‘Normal alchemy’    Richard Craib, the founder of Numerai, a hedge fund built by a crowdsourced network of data scientists, says he has come across young startups that are using artificial intelligence to get an edge looking at on-chain transactions, or mining alternative data around news flows in the crypto industry.      But he doubted Renaissance would be going to such lengths, opting for what he called “normal alchemy” instead.      “Renaissance and firms like it are very good at working with time-series data and already understand corn futures and oil futures and trade all those markets,” he said. “So I don't think it means they have any thesis on bitcoin. I don’t believe they are going to be ‘long bitcoin’ or something, but it’s definitely worth taking on.”        Read more: This USV-Backed Startup Has a Solution for Buying Information With Confidence      While it might be alluring to think of a firm like Renaissance having some kind of dedicated bitcoin desk, it’s likely to be simply plugging in existing models, Craib added.      “I would guess they are seeing it more as, what can we do just with the price volume data, because a lot of their strategies don't require new alternative datasets,” he said.    Just another instrument    Emmanuel Goh, CEO of derivatives data platform Skew, agreed that bitcoin is probably “just another instrument” to Renaissance.      “They have access to all the historical data and will be running all sorts of modeling on the instrument itself and see if there are some interesting patterns,” he said. “The dataset is a little bit smaller than for other instruments,” he said.    The Renaissance filinghttps://files.adviserinfo.sec.gov/IAPD/Content/Common/crd_iapd_Brochure.aspx?BRCHR_VRSN_ID=636807 is further evidence that the derivatives market is where a lot of people will go to express their views in terms of financial instruments, Goh added. “We will be tracking how much activity there is on CME futures contract and if that picks up meaningfully to see if this means more and more people are entering,” he said.    Read more: Crypto Derivatives: A Corner of the Market or the Market Itself?      These days, bitcoin trades more than the currencies of many smaller countries. But Boonen of B2C2 said there might still be a question whether the bitcoin market will be big enough to be worth it for Renaissance.      “Bitcoin remains a reasonably small market; it's not the tiny market that it used to be, trading volumes are there and are strong. But I wonder whether the market today is big enough for it to be worth the risk for Renaissance,” said Boonen. “They are going to trade derivatives but still, there is possibly more risk than in trading conventional assets.”    Very uncorrelated    It’s also worth asking what Renaissance dipping into bitcoin futures means in terms of the leading cryptocurrency’s correlation to the rest of the financial system, a question highlighted by the recent COVID-19 markets crash that saw crypto fall with the rest of the S&P 500.      From the perspective of a fund like Renaissance, bitcoin remains a very uncorrelated asset, said Numerai’s Craib.      Read more: Crypto Market Maker B2C2 Hires Wall Street FX Vet to Lead US Expansion      “When you are a big fund and you find this liquid market that's uncorrelated and can take a lot of trading, you really kind of have to trade it. Because it'll help your Sharpes so much to have a new source of alpha,” he said, alluding to the return from an investment balanced against the risk.      The more things you can trade, the more of an edge it gives you, said Craib, with the aim to create a model that works in every country and every sector of the economy and every commodity.      “Then you really have something. You can make a million predictions per day and be right in just over half a million of them. That's much more what Renaissance is trying to do,” he said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | COMMODITY | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/04/21/long-bitcoin-it-aint-crypto-traders-make-sense-of-renaissance-filing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fdaa9de8cd90a160310d21b8f08238a51fc72481-1500x904.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431768,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN6PJh,1587496587,Dutch Central Bank Wants to Be European Union's CBDC Proving Ground,"The Dutch Central Bank (DNB) thinks the eurosystem’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) should be more programmable than bitcoin.      Saying on Tuesday that cryptocurrencies offer some technological lessons for the banks they seek to displace, DNB wrote that smart contracts could help “future proof” CBDCs. The 45-page CBDC report is the Netherlands' pitch to become a digital currency proving ground for the eurosystem.      “A smart contract system with complex logic potentially increases the demand for CBDC and offers opportunities to reduce transaction costs,” DNB said. “In this way it could contribute to diversity and innovation in the payment market.”      The striking admission comes as the DNB jockeys for influence in European central bankers’ growing digital currency debate. Just last month the French seized that discussion with an open call for limited CBDC experiments. The Netherlands, which does not have its own active experiment just yet, went a step further in the report: DNB wants to be a research, development and deployment hub for a European CBDC.      “If the decision should be taken within the eurosystem to experiment with some more concrete type of CBDC, we are ready to play a leading role. The Netherlands provides a suitable testing ground for such an experiment,” DNB said.    Rise of private cash    That appears to be an imperative for the Dutch, whose 17 million residents are the least likely in the eurozone to pay for goods or services with cash, according to a 2017 European Union report. Three years later Holland’s cash aversion has only come into stronger focus: there are fewer ATMs and fewer cash withdrawals each year. On a macro scale, “private digital money” use – private money being funds tied to a commercial bank account – is growing and Libra, though neutered, is still a threat.      Responding as well to what it said was its own citizens’ growing interest in CBDC, the DNB said digital currency could help ensure that public money stays alive in a digital future.      The report offers a detailed look at what a “reasonable” eurozone CBDC could be and compares the choices against some monetary benchmarks: Libra, bitcoin, cash, commercial bank money and central bank reserves.      “After 10 years of experimenting with private cryptos, the question is whether some techniques have sufficient added value for use in CBDC,” DNB mulled. It concluded that smart contracts may be the only “technique” worth salvaging, in part because its future-forward flexibility could make CBDC more in demand.      It indicated that CBDC should be more programmable to bitcoin and second only to libra.    Centralized coins    DNB divorced smart contacts from another less desirable hallmark feature of cryptocurrency: distributed ledger technology (DLT). DNB roundly rejected DLT as a feature coined by idealists working outside the banking system.      “The fully decentralized solution of, for example, bitcoin, with decentralized validation, was partly ideologically driven,” DNB said as it argued against bitcoin’s resource-intensive and potentially cumbersome model of distributed consensus. “It seems unnecessary for CBDC to make those sacrifices.”      Even so, DNB embraced the need for some anonymity that bitcoin evangelists and cash stalwarts adore. DLT makes bitcoin transaction history completely transparent even while offering users a means to transact pseudonymously.      Conversely, commercial banks, who have full knowledge of their users’ transaction history, have a market incentive to sell data that central banks do not. DNB therefore said that a CBDC should offer a selective degree of privacy second only to wholly anonymous cash.      Those technical aspects and more build out DNB’s uncannily detailed envisioning of CBDC. Coming also with DNB’s emphatic call for CBDC to shore up the public money system as the world continues to change, it amounts to a striking endorsement of CBDC – perhaps, as the Dutch Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra told parliament Tuesday, the loudest in Europe so far.      “In no other euro area has the central bank so clearly expressed a positive attitude towards digital central bank money aimed at the general public,” Hoekstra said.      “The ball is now” in the eurosystem’s court, he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BCH | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/04/21/dutch-central-bank-wants-to-be-european-unions-cbdc-proving-ground,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8da74720e6bea7014f0e794011e0ce2d2e418e9c-1420x915.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431765,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN6PFh,1587489949,Multi-Chain DeFi Protocol Raises $750K in Token Sale With Framework Ventures,"Framework Ventures – a fund focused on decentralized finance (DeFi) plays including Synthetix and Chainlink – has purchased between 1 percent and 5 percent of all Kava tokens.      Announced Tuesday, the token deal, valued at $750,000, comes ahead of Kava’s launch next month. Similar to DeFi platform MakerDAO, Kava will allow users to create collateralized debt positions (CDPs) on the Kava protocol in exchange for a stablecoin, USDX, pegged one-to-one with the U.S. dollar.      Unlike the predominantly ether-focused MakerDAO, Kava will work with most any digital asset, or at least that’s the plan, according to Kava Labs CEO Brian Kerr. Kava is built on the Tendermint consensus algorithm, which is also employed by the Cosmos, the blockchain interoperability project.      As a result, Kava “should be able to seamlessly bridge to any other blockchain,” Kerr said.      Kava will begin with BNB, the native token of the Binance ecosystem, and branch into XRP and bitcoin. Kava conducted an initial exchange offering (IEO) on Binance in October and counts Arrington XRP Capital as an investor.      Kerr said the firm will add bitcoin as the technical capabilities become possible. A key struggle remains the multi-signature structure for bitcoin, which does not easily lend itself to DeFi products. Bitcoin’s upcoming Schnorr and Taproot updates will make the addition more seamless, Kerr said.      Before the launch, Framework Ventures advised Kava on its token inflation model and plans to provide continued technical support for the Kava team, Framework co-founder Michael Anderson told CoinDesk in an interview.      “As the network launches and we can see the token economics for the product in motion, in many cases, just like with Synthetix or Chainlink, we will double down,” Anderson said of his firm’s investment strategy.    Investing in tornado country    Kava’s launch has been preceded by turbulent weather in the DeFi space.      Lendf.me, a protocol in the dForce ecosystem, lost 99 percent of its funds through a hacking exploit in a single night (which has now been returned). A month before that, DeFi in general faced its biggest test yet when ETH prices tumbled on March 12 causing many systems to fail or become overly stressed.      One of the biggest losers on that day was MakerDAO, whose infrastructure proved less robust than previously thought. The finance platform accrued debt that had to be bailed out by venture capital firms. Lingering stability issues with dai’s dollar peg have persisted for weeks. A class-action lawsuit filed in the Northern District Court of California against the Maker Foundation for negligence was the cherry on top.      Kerr said the difference for Kava lays in a codebase with limited functionality compared to DeFi protocols like MakerDAO. In other words, Kerr said, the less your system can do, the safer your system is.      “[Kava] can liquidate and auction, but that's it. It's very specific purposes – there isn't any other functionality that can be built into what we've done. That allows us to thoroughly test it so we can have a very strong confidence level that there's no sort of open exploits available,” Kerr said.      Either way, Kava is joining a crowded room as interest in DeFi appears to grow. Projects like MakerDAO are adding assets to the mix, with Brave’s Basic Attention Token (BAT) and the Coinbase-supported USDC stablecoin added as forms of loan collateral in recent months. Projects are experimenting with bringing in BTC-pegged assets to kickstart DeFi on the Tezos blockchain.      However, Kerr said there is still plenty of room for the sector to grow.      “We were kind of scratching our heads for why the same [DeFi] services weren't available to all the other cryptocurrency communities. It really comes down to the technology hasn't been built yet. … These other blockchains don't have the smart-contract capabilities to support it natively.”",POSITIVE,BAT | BTC | BNB,BAT | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MKR | BNB,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/04/21/multi-chain-defi-protocol-raises-750k-in-token-sale-with-framework-ventures,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0800ab6a76eb71cd6f1ee57fd64772a04528ed8e-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Scanning transactions on the Ethereum blockchain shows that a wallet address conspicuously called ""Lendf.Me Hack"" has sent a series of ether, bitcoin derivatives and an assortment of stablecoins payments to the admin address for the Lendf.Me project. As of Tuesday morning, the amounts total around $24 million, or about $1 million short of the initial attack. The hacker's motives are unclear.      You're reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they're significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk's newsletters here. Here's the story:    Top Shelf    Unknown Motives The hacker that drained $25 million in cryptocurrency from decentralized finance protocol dForce over the weekend has returned roughly $24 million of the stolen funds. Multiple transactions from an address labelled ""Lendf.Me Hack"" were sent to the admin address for the Lendf.Me project, as seen on the Ethereum blockchain. Curiously, the hacker did not return exactly the same balance of assets as were stolen, but returned some of the value in other types of tokens.      China Confirms China's central bank confirmed it will be testing a mobile application for storing and exchanging the digital yuan, after screenshots circulated on social media. The People’s Bank of China will roll out internal tests for the national digital currency (DECP) in Shenzhen, Suzhou, Xiong’An and Chengdu, according to the bank’s Friday statement, but insists it's just a test.      A cabinet level department in China said blockchain will join other emerging technologies such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence and the internet of things will form an integral part of the country's data and technology infrastructure.      Amicus Association The Blockchain Association has filed a “friend of the court” brief in the ongoing legal case between the SEC and messaging startup Kik, arguing the firm's kin token is not a security. ""The Blockchain Association is troubled that the SEC’s recent arguments have conflated entering into a contract with accredited investors under a well-established exemption with other events involving the sale or distribution of tokens to the public,"" the association's executive director, Kristin Smith, told CoinDesk.      Heifer Jumps Over the Stablecoin Fence Nonprofit Heifer International is joining the Libra Association as the 23rd official member of the organization. ""At Heifer International, we work with some of the world’s poorest farmers, helping them to sustainably increase production and access new markets. As farmers grow their businesses, one of the major challenges they face is access to credit,"" it said in the blog post, adding that the global Libra stablecoin could fill this gap.      Leery of Libra The scaled back vision of the libra stablecoin as a permissioned payment rail for tokenized national currencies is still a threat to national monetary sovereignty and more likely than ever to be adopted, writes Lex Sokolin, a CoinDesk columnist. “The Libra network is a strong candidate to subsume CBDC innovation, and see the launch of various regulated fiat coins on its protocol,” he said, adding, “This is the war for money. This is the war for finance. Who gets to build the fortress?”      Bitcoin Futures The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved Bitnomial Exchange to operate as a designated contracts market, meaning the exchange can now offer bitcoin futures and options contracts. The exchange joins CME, Cboe, Bakkt, ErisX and LedgerX as licensed providers of these crypto derivatives, and appears to be focusing strictly on physically-settled contracts, meaning customers receive the actual bitcoin when the contract expires.      Reversible ICOs German regulators have approved reversible ICOs, a funding mechanism that protects investors by allowing them to withdraw funds from a dubious token project.

Dai For You Interest rates have spiked for deposits of dai, the U.S. dollar-linked stablecoin, on the decentralized finance platform Compound, as people withdraw from the network resulting in a shortage of funds to lend. The annual percentage rate a user would earn by lending dai on the platform rose above 14 percent as of 19:00 UTC Monday – the highest level since March 16, according to Codefi Data, a unit of Ethereum startup ConsenSys.      Stablecoins Spike The market capitalization of Ethereum-based stablecoins has nearly doubled year to date to $6.25 billion, amid market turmoil and inflation of foreign currencies against the dollar. (The Block)      Lightning Attack New research warns cryptocurrency users that the Lightning Network can expose financial information of bitcoin payments thought to be anonymous. “The gap between the potential privacy properties of the Lightning Network and the actual ones is large.

Big Tech Goes Open Source Amazon, Facebook and IBM among other big tech firms and nonprofits have signed the Open COVID Pledge, a promise to free up their patents and intellectual property so developers can build solutions to the coronavirus pandemic without fear of running afoul of copyright law. “It’s not just universities but commercial companies that are hesitant to build tools, unless they have the rights they need,” said Mark Radcliffe, a partner at DLA Piper and co-author of the pledge.      European Exit European researchers advocating for a decentralized contact tracing protocol have exited the European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (PEPP-PT) consortium, amid concerns France and Germany could choose a centralized system that puts personal privacy at risk.      Brrrr vs. Debasement While many caution the excessive printing of U.S. dollars in response to the novel coronavirus due to fears of debasement and hyperinflation, CoinDesk columnist Jill Carlson has learned to love the money printer. “The fact is, we need the Federal Reserve’s money printer to BRRR right now. Those fears may not be baseless over the long run, but even having spent a material part of my career researching inflationary crises, working in emerging markets, and holding bitcoin, I’m not currently worried about excessive money printing.”      Permanently Digital In response to the “EARN IT” Act, an attempt to outlaw end-to-end encryption in the United States, a bitcoin cash developer has built an unbreakable encrypted messaging system called bch-encrypt, which allows anyone with a BCH wallet to send intrusion-proof messages.

42374498,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZzy3,1587488413,Crypto Payments for Child Porn Grew 32% in 2019: Report,"Nearly $1 million in bitcoin and ethereum flowed into child pornography-linked wallet addresses in 2019, continuing a multiyear upward trend that captures the complicated realities of mass crypto adoption.  The statistic, disclosed in a Tuesday blog post by forensics firm Chainalysis, is a tiny sliver of overall crypto usage – even on March 31, 2019, one of the slower trading days of that year, Messari’s estimated $128 million worth of bitcoin in transit dwarfed the nearly $930,000 that Chainalysis traced to addresses flagged by the Internet Watch Foundation across 365 days.  But the troubling total nonetheless documents crypto’s growing popularity as a method of payment for child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Last year, 32 percent more crypto value moved into CSAM than in 2018, which itself was 212 percent higher than 2017’s total. Chainalysis based its totals on the cryptos’ value at time of transaction.  The 2019 figure comes in spite of law enforcement agencies’ global rush to dismantle online CSAM operations, including some of the largest ever uncovered. March 2018’s cross-border takedown of the Welcome to Video CSAM ring shuttered a darknet site that had collected some 420 total bitcoin across its nearly three-year reign.  Traceability  While Welcome to Video’s downfall did not stop 2018 or 2019 from hitting record usage highs, it does illustrate one of the upsides – from a law enforcement standpoint – of people using crypto to pay for CSAM. Bitcoin and ether are inherently traceable, and when users pay for CSAM without attempting to thoroughly obfuscate their tracks, they’re surprisingly easy to find and jail.  Most of the funds come right from exchanges, said Nina Heyden, an economist at Chainalysis. Better yet: from compliant exchanges who collect their users’ identity data as required by law.  “The good thing about that is those exchanges often cooperate with law enforcement when law enforcement requests more information during investigations,” Heyden said.  For example, law enforcement used crypto tracing software to arrest hundreds of Welcome to Video customers whose transaction trails often led to identifiable exchange accounts.

42383549,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9wsRD,1587470819,First Mover: 10 Takeaways for Bitcoin From Negative Oil Prices,"U.S. oil futures prices turned negative Monday for the first time ever. Is it good or bad for bitcoin?      The coronavirus pandemic has so completely upended the global economy that energy demand has fallen off a cliff. People are barely driving. People are barely flying.      You're reading First Mover, CoinDesk's daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      The imbalance came to a head this week as oil storage tanks started to fill up, forcing traders to pay extra to get rid of their delivery obligations – resulting in negative prices. The May futures contract on West Texas Intermediate crude, which expires Tuesday, tumbled to minus $37.63 a barrel, from a positive price of about $30 on Friday. The June contract slid 15 percent to about $21 a barrel, leaving the black gold down more than 60 percent in 2020.      Bitcoin slid 3.5 percent on Monday to about $6,900, a pretty tepid reaction for notoriously volatile cryptocurrency markets.      So what are the takeaways from the unprecedented oil price sell-off? CoinDesk gathered the views of crypto-market traders, analysts and executives. (Quick teaser: Bitcoin suddenly doesn't look so volatile compared with oil, as noted by pro-crypto twitterati here and here.)      1) In the short term, falling oil prices are deflationary. Drivers will need less money to pay for gasoline once they return to driving. Airlines will pay less for jet fuel. Plastics manufacturers will see lower input costs. More broadly, for bitcoin traders who see the cryptocurrency as a hedge against inflation the oil-price crash offers a warning of how deflationary the coronavirus-driven economic recession might turn out to be – despite trillions of dollars of money injections from the Federal Reserve and other central banks.      ""If you want to view bitcoin as an inflation hedge, this whole thing is going to put some pressure on bitcoin as well,"" says John Todaro, director of research at TradeBlock. ""The dollar right now is really strengthening against all assets.""      2) As a commodity, bitcoin doesn't have storage considerations like oil – or physical delivery issues like gold. Futures markets with physical delivery require traders to come up with the goods if they own a contract going into the expiration date. There's little likelihood that delivering bitcoin would ever collide with physical capacity constraints.      ""The oil markets are yet another inefficient legacy system that needs to be disrupted,"" Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer of Arca Funds, wrote in an email. ""The fact that it is physically impossible to take delivery of a barrel of oil shows that this system, like many, is completely broken and in need of change.""      3) Amid this year's economic and market turmoil, bitcoin is holding up. A study published last week by researchers at the Federal Reserve's Kansas City branch noted that historically, 10-year U.S. Treasury notes have worked well as a safe-haven asset ""consistently,"" gold ""occasionally"" and bitcoin ""never."" But so far this year, bitcoin is down just 3.8 percent – nearly holding its own against the Fed's own U.S. dollar. Gold is up 12 percent, but the Standard & Poor's 500 Index of U.S. stocks is down 13 percent. Oil's price crash makes bitcoin look stable by comparison.      ""For all those who've challenged bitcoin's use as a store of value or the narrative that bitcoin hasn't held its value all that well during the crisis, I beg to differ,"" Mati Greenspan, founder of the cryptocurrency and foreign-exchange analysis firm Quantum Economics, wrote in an email to clients.      4) A bitcoin exchange-traded fund application might now compare favorably with oil ETFs. Bitcoin prices tumbled 40 percent on March 12 as investors and traders across all financial markets scrambled into cash. Such volatility underscore the risks of cryptocurrency markets, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has thus far refused to approve a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). (Aside from high volatility, the market has also been hit by market-manipulation allegations.) But the oil market, which has several approved ETFs , operates in the shadow of OPEC, an international cartel of oil-producing nations that attempts to set the price via output quotas. New signs of just how volatile the oil market can be might undercut some of the reasons for delaying a bitcoin ETF approval.      ""A bitcoin ETF is too risky but can I interest you in options on levered oil ETFs?"" Juthica Chou, former COO of the bitcoin-derivatives company LedgerX, tweeted on Monday.      5) More government bailouts are likely, along with more central bank emergency lending. With oil prices crashing, debt defaults are likely to surge in the energy industry. Banks might face higher loan losses, and bond markets could become increasingly wobbly. Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams said last week in a speech that he and his colleagues ""are dedicated to doing everything within our power to support the functioning of financial markets and help put the economy on a strong footing."" It's unclear what the Fed could do for the oil market, or oil companies – or, for that matter, the next industry to falter under the economic toll. Given the assurances of Fed officials, it's hard to rule out more stimulus. That could mean more inflation once the economy recovers and demand returns.      ""They're going to pump more dollars into the system,"" Todaro said.      6) The drop in oil demand shows how rapidly the world is adopting new technologies. CoinDesk reported last month that remote working has been one of the unsung heroes of the coronavirus crisis; many professionals, representing half the economy, based on rough estimates, have been able to continue doing their jobs from home. The rapid shift – thanks, Zoom! – has allowed the economy to avoid deeper economic damage, especially critical with some 22 million jobless claims filed in the U.S. over the past four weeks. Bitcoin, along with digital-asset markets more generally, could benefit as more commerce is done via the Internet, reducing the usefulness of germy paper bills. Oil might be a loser.      ""Technology has made oil both cheaper to produce and more efficient to use, which has slowed demand,"" Rich Rosenblum, a former Goldman Sachs managing director of oil trading who now leads the markets group at the digital-asset trading firm GSR, wrote in an email. ""In contrast, cryptocurrency is a futurist product, benefiting from the continued march towards a technologically interconnected existence.""      7) Unlike oil, bitcoin's supply is predictable. The price plunge in the oil patch already has led to supply-cutting agreements by giant state producers including Saudi Arabia, Russia and Mexico, and U.S. producers are likely to shut production in response to falling profitability. Bitcoin miners might drop out of the network when prices tumble – or, perhaps, after next month's rewards halving cuts their profitability. But issuance of new supply is strictly regulated by the cryptocurrency's underlying computer programming when the blockchain network was launched 11 years ago.      ""Unlike oil, bitcoin's rate of emission is controlled by its own protocol and does not change based on geopolitical events,"" Joe DiPasquale, CEO of the cryptocurrency hedge fund BitBull Capital, wrote in an email. ""The crash in oil prices is a part of the current economic crisis, which is also witnessing mass fiat currency printing, which is devaluing wealth around the world. In contrast, bitcoin is limited in its total supply and its rate of emission actually decreases with time, making its supply curve much more predictable.""      8) More coronavirus-related market surprises are likely in store. After swinging wildly earlier this year, bitcoin prices have stabilized in recent weeks in a range between roughly $6,400 and $7,400. One reason might be that the depth of the coronavirus-induced recession is still unknown. For weeks some oil industry executives have been warning of the potential for storage facilities to fill up without big production cuts. But not until Monday did the oil futures market witness negative prices.      ""Bitcoin is trading sideways because we still don't really know what the economic shakeout is going to be,"" Todaro said.      9) Miner profitability probably won't be affected too much. Many big bitcoin miners use long-term power supply contracts to lock in wholesale electricity prices. So even if a steep decline in oil prices leads to lower costs for other generating fuels, such as natural gas, there might not be an immediate pass-through in terms of lower production costs for bitcoin miners.      ""It's too much of a tertiary impact,"" Rosenblum said in a phone interview. By contrast, if bitcoin prices don't double in tandem with the halving in May, the crypto-mining industry might see a shakeout similar to ""what's just happened in the oil industry.""      10) Bitcoiners are tired of all the shade throwing. Cameron Winklevoss, president of the cryptocurrency financial company Gemini, tweeted that ""oil can no longer be considered a reliable store of value."" Few investors probably ever saw it as that. But the broader point is that oil, long embraced by Wall Street titans including Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs as a grown-up market, now looks pretty janky in its own right. A review of #cryptotwitter on Monday revealed the schadenfreude was palpable.      ""Whatever fingers are being pointed at bitcoin, it seems like it's much worse in the traditional commodity markets in terms of the massive dislocation,"" Rosenblum said. ""It takes away some of the criticisms of bitcoin being a funky market.""    Tweet of the day    Bitcoin watch    Trend: Bitcoin is looking weak, having printed losses on Monday alongside (but nowhere near as bad as) the crash in oil prices. Equity markets are down, too.      The cryptocurrency is trading around $6,820 at press time with the daily chart reporting bearish conditions. For instance, Bitcoin's 4 percent drop on Monday confirmed a bearish lower highat $7,300.      ""On the daily chart, we have a lower second top,"" Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank, told CoinDesk.      Monday's price slide also validated the weakening of the upward momentum signaled by the MACD histogram, an indicator used to identify trend strength and trend changes. As a result, a drop to $6,450, the lower end of the recent two-week-long trending range, may be seen.      The cryptocurrency faced selling pressure on Monday, as West Texas Intermediate oil (WTI) dropped below zero for the first time, underscoring the collapse in demand caused by the coronavirus pandemic and forced investors to stocks.      Sentiment remains fragile on Tuesday with the global equity markets still feeling the after effects of the oil price slide. At press time, major European equity indices are flashing red and the futures tied to the S&P 500 are reporting a 0.45 percent decline.      Notably, markets are again buying the U.S. dollar amid a risk-off mood, as evidenced from the dollar index's 0.30 percent rise. Meanwhile, gold, a classic haven asset, is flatlined around $1,710.      With dash for cash boding well for the greenback and equities feeling the pull of gravity due to recession fears, the path of least resistance for bitcoin appears to be on the downside.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | COMMODITY | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/21/first-mover-10-takeaways-for-bitcoin-from-negative-oil-prices,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/38383d0c5eec2c30f5cdb7e4698430c84214f443-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383547,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9wsNR,1587469523,Bitcoin Under Pressure After Oil Prices Crash to Record Lows,"Bitcoin is looking weak after Monday's big crash in the oil markets.      The top cryptocurrency by market value is changing hands near $6,820 at time of writing, having faced rejection above $7,200 yesterday., according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      Bitcoin's fall came as the price of oil, popularly known as ""black gold,"" tanked on oversupply fears. Notably, traders fled from the May futures contract on the West Texas Intermediate's (WTI) crude, the main oil benchmark for North America, sending prices below zero for the first time on record.      The unprecedented sell-off has injected uncertainty into global financial markets. As a result, stocks dropped on Monday with the S&P 500 losing 1.8 percent of its value. The risk-off macro-environment has again strengthened bearish pressures for bitcoin.      ""The downside in BTC is more likely attributable to losses in the equities market, which may be directly or indirectly affected by Crude prices, than the downward trend for crude directly,"" said Matthew Dibb, co-founder of Stack.      Read more: Negative Oil Prices Could Hurt Bitcoin Miners Who Use Flared Gas      Bitcoin has largely moved in tandem with the stock markets, in particular the S&P 500 index, from the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic in the last week of February.      The latest drop in bitcoin prices marks a failure by the bulls to keep gains above the widely tracked 100-week average at $7,054.      Bitcoin closed last week above the 100-week average, having repeatedly failed to do so in the preceding four weeks. As a result, some observers were expecting the upward momentum to gather pace. That didn't happen, as noted.      The failed breakout is accompanied by a negative reading on the weekly chart's money flow index – a sign that sellers have the upper hand right now.      As a result, further losses toward $6,472 (April 16 low) could be seen.      The bearish technical setup is accompanied by continued sell-off in equities and oil. While WTI's May futures contract, set to expire on Tuesday, has risen back above $1, the June contract is now facing increased selling pressure and is currently trading near $11.80, down 40 percent on the day.      Analysts at Goldman Sachs have warned the plunge in black gold is symptomatic of unprecedented supplies. Put simply, oil is likely to continue taking a beating in the short term.      Importantly, a cash crunch seems to be gripping the markets again, as is evident from the losses in traditional safe havens like gold, the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc – alongside a 0.5 percent uptick in the dollar index.      ""[Bitcoin] may go down to $6,400,"" Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank, told CoinDesk.      However, some observers are optimistic about bitcoin's future prospects. ""The [miner reward] halving should help keep a bid to bitcoin in the coming months,"" Richard Rosenblum, co-head of trading at GSR, told CoinDesk.      Read more: Remote Working Proves Unexpected Hero as Half of US Economy Shifts to Home Offices      Rosenblum added bitcoin is a futuristic product that will ultimately benefit from the growing prevalence of technology in consumers' everyday lives.      Meanwhile, Stack's CEO Matthew Dibb thinks bitcoin and other major digital assets have largely remained ""out of harm's way"" despite the oil crash. ""While BTC is slightly down on today’s markets, we are not seeing any significant correlation between the market and energy commodities,"" said Dibb, adding the cryptocurrency will remain bullish as long as prices are holding above $5,800.      Supporting these arguments is the recent decline in the number of bitcoins held on exchanges, which suggests a shift to the long-term holding strategies.

Blockchain developer IOV Labs said Tuesday it had created a proof-of-concept, for a permissioned blockchain network, based on RSK Smart Contract Network, in conjunction with the central bank and major commercial banks in Argentina including Santander and BBVA.      The solution is aimed speed fiat payments, make them more reliable and introduce end-to-end traceability, IOV said.      ""By implementing this type of platform, the financial system will be able to build an integral collaborative ecosystem in line with the current modern technological advances and on par with the world’s most innovative financial systems,"" said Diego Gutiérrez Zaldívar, CEO of IOV Labs.      ""Given the global circumstances we are facing, we need now more than ever to use technology in order to optimize processes and provide better services to our citizens,” he added.      See also: Just a Test: China Central Bank Confirms Digital Yuan Mobile App Trials      Network participants will include the BCRA, banks, clearinghouses and other financial entities. While currently in the testing phase, IOV and BCRA said the new network could form the basis for an alternative clearing system.      While Argentina's central bank was an early mover in looking at efficiencies created by blockchain, it has also taken a dim view on cryptocurrencies. It issued a statement as far back as 2014, telling citizens they could not use digital assets such as bitcoin as a form of legal tender and warning of potential fraud.      One of the goals of the BCRA-initiated proof-of-concept was also to demonstrate there are other viable use cases for blockchain technology besides cryptocurrencies, in particular using smart contracts.      See also: French Central Bank Puts Out Call for Digital Currency Experiments      The new layer trialed by the BCRA runs along the same lines as a similar blockchain initiative, also based on RSK, hosted by the country's primary gas distributor earlier this year. Known as Gasnet, the idea was to use distributed ledgers to bring new efficiencies to Argentina's backlogged gas certification process.      As other central banks move toward developing and issuing their own digital currencies, it isn’t yet clear if the BCRA’s developing interbank settlement layer could one day form the basis for a digital peso.

42383534,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ws8L,1587460800,Blockchain Association Tries to Draw Legal Line Between Kik's Token and Its 2017 Pre-Sale,"The Blockchain Association has filed a “friend of the court” brief in the ongoing legal case between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and messaging startup Kik, arguing the firm's kin token is not a security.      The advocacy group argues the SEC is wrongfully conflating Kik's 2017 exempt offering of securities to accredited investors with the issuance of blockchain tokens in its brief, filed Friday.      Rather, Kik arranged its token sale in two parts: a private SAFT (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens) and a public token sale, the association wrote in a blog post on its filing. For the SAFT, Kik filed for a Regulation D exemption.      The brief cites one SEC commissioner, Hester Pierce, who wrote in her “safe haven” proposal that “conflating the two concepts [of the investment contract and the underlying asset] has limited secondary trading and has had disastrous consequences for the ability of token networks to become functional.”      ""The Blockchain Association is troubled that the SEC’s recent arguments have conflated entering into a contract with accredited investors under a well-established exemption with other events involving the sale or distribution of tokens to the public,"" the association's executive director, Kristin Smith, told CoinDesk.      ""In consistent statements, the SEC’s leadership, including Bill Hinman and Jay Clayton, had previously made clear that something that is a security at one point in time can later become a non-security – for example, when a network is sufficiently decentralized or fully functional,"" she said.    SAFTs go to court    The argument comes fresh on the heels of a ruling on the case between the SEC and messaging platform Telegram, and the gram tokens it had planned to issue for its Telegram Open Network (TON) blockchain.      In late February, a New York court ruled in favor of the SEC, agreeing the sale of the future tokens to accredited investors by Telegram and the inevitable re-sale of those tokens to the broad public were two parts of the same distribution scheme and was therefore a securities transaction.      However, the judge did not say gram tokens were themselves securities (a footnote clarifies the judge did not make a ruling one way or another on that front).      “The wealthy purchasers who obtained large quantities of Kin at a significant discount were but a first step to a broader distribution to the public – in which purchasers planned to and did participate,” the SEC said when it filed motion for summary judgment on March 20.      The Blockchain Association believes the ruling should not apply: “The Court should not adopt the novel theory advanced in the recent Telegram decision: that complying with existing securities exemptions by contracting with sophisticated accredited investors amounts to a 'scheme' to distribute unregistered securities to the public at some point in the future.”      However, Smith believes that whatever the court decides about Kik, this won't necessarily affect the entire token industry in the end: ""As with the Telegram lawsuit, even if the court finds in favor of the SEC in this case, that does not necessarily have implications for the SAFT model in general.""      See also: CFTC Approves Bitnomial to Offer Futures Contracts Settled in Real Bitcoin      The Blockchain Association has already filed two amicus briefs in support of Telegram, arguing the SEC should not threaten the innovation punishing the company for trying to comply with the regulation, i.e., selling tokens to accredited investors only and filing for an exemption.      The SEC's case against Kik began last June. In the following months, Kik shut down its messaging app, in which the kin token had been planned to be integrated, and sold it to a company called MediaLab. With the court ruling still pending, both the SEC and Kik filed motions for summary judgement at the end of March, asking for a ruling without full trial.

But according to two academic papers published in March and April, relatively straightforward cyberattacks could unearth balances on the Lightning Network. Authors of the March paper also unraveled pathways and parties of hidden payments.      “The gap between the potential privacy properties of the Lightning Network and the actual ones is large. As it is designed right now, the Lightning Network opens the door for various attacks,” said Ania Piotrowska, a cryptography researcher at the University College London, which collaborated with the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign on the March study.      Read more: Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Is Growing ‘Increasingly Centralized,’ Researchers Find      Nodes, building blocks of the Lightning Network, are software gateways that exchange bitcoin via payment channels. Both research teams, the other at the University of Luxembourg and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, conducted attacks on only public channels. According to a report in January from cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, 72.2 percent of Lightning Network channels are publicly announced, and 27.8 percent are kept private.      “As Lightning Network gains popularity, it is often touted as an alternative to bitcoin that is not only more scalable but also more private,” said Piotrowska, who also works at cryptocurrency privacy infrastructure startup Nym Technologies. “We felt that it was an interesting research question to study how private Lightning actually is.”      A raft of academic and corporate institutions have taken up Lightning Network development, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Digital Currency Initiative to bitcoin satellite maker Blockstream, engineering group Lightning Labs and Square Crypto, the cryptocurrency unit of the publicly traded financial technology company Square.      In December, Bitfinex, a high-volume cryptocurrency exchange, opted to let customers trade bitcoin over the Lightning Network.    Three-pronged attack    The American and British researchers, a team of seven, carried out three attacks on the Lightning Network during the months of December, January and February. Two attacks targeted the Lightning Network’s test network and main network to determine balances.      By forwarding payments with fake hashes – unique cryptographic identifiers of transactions – to channels opened with 132 test network nodes and six of the 10 largest main network nodes, the first balance attack accessed the balances of 619 test network channels and 678 main network channels.      The counterfeit payment spamming was stopped when error messages went away, a sign that actual channel amounts had been matched.      Read more: Cannabis Shops Are Using Zap’s Lightning App During Coronavirus Cash Crunch      At the start of the first balance attack, 4,585 test network channels and 1,293 main network channels were trialed from 3,035 test network nodes sharing 8,665 channels and 6,107 main network nodes sharing 35,069 channels.      The second balance attack also discovered the balances of randomly selected main network channels in a process of elimination with error messages. However, payment hashes were routed through two channels the researchers opened with two intermediate channels that sat between one start and one end channel.      Piecing together changes in balances learned from the first two attacks, the third attack constructed snapshots of the Lightning Network at different time intervals to detect payment movements and their senders, recipients and amounts.      “Identifying the sender and recipient means that we identify them according to their public keys and any other information linked to the node,” such as an IP address, a numerical string that tags the location of an electronic device that connects to the internet, she said. Public keys are handed out freely between parties in payment interactions; private keys that are guarded closely and that give ownership access of funds were not extracted.      Piotrowska noted that, owing to ethical concerns, the third attack was performed on a simulation of the Lightning Network.    Attack analysis    Mariusz Nowostawski, a computer scientist at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology and one of four authors of the April paper, said the March paper’s first balance attack is a derivative of “an older, known method” and that the second balance attack, while new, is limited to small-scale attacks.      The second balance attack “requires opening two channels for each single channel being probed, which is extremely costly as those opening and closing channels need to be on-chain,” Nowostawski said. “And it requires the balance in one of the channels to be placed on the side of the node being probed,” risking the attacker’s funds.      Read more: Lightning Solves Bitcoin’s Speed Problem, but Watch Out for Fraudsters      To stave off the loss of funds, an external liquidity service – similar to the Bitrefill liquidity provider used in the March paper attack – needs to fund the channel. Even so, the balance attack falls flat if a channel refuses to accept a channel opening, Nowostawski said.      The balance attack studied by the Luxembourger and Norwegian researchers doesn’t expend resources or rely on intermediate channels, said Nowostawski. The attack is also an error-message-reading algorithm that probes channels, but supposedly on a larger and faster scale that reduces new channel openings, fund lock-up time and contact with the bitcoin blockchain.      Benedikt Bünz, a Stanford University Applied Cryptography Group researcher, called the papers important to privacy in cryptocurrencies.      “For strong and good privacy, cryptographic solutions such as zero-knowledge proofs and confidential transactions are needed,” said Bünz. Zero-knowledge proofs, a cryptographic structure, could facilitate payments that don't leave traces of information behind with another party.

According to data visible on the Ethereum blockchain, multiple transactions were initiated from 6:00 UTC on Tuesday from an address labelled ""Lendf.Me Hack"" to the admin address for the Lendf.Me project.      The transactions included some extremely large amounts, such as one for 57,992 ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain – an amount worth around $10 million at press time.      Additional transactions involved various U.S. dollar-linked stablecoins – such as USDT, BUSD, TUSD, DAI, USDC, HUSD and PAX – totaling nearly $10 million.      Further, a total of 581 units of WBTC, HBTC and imBTC – ethereum tokens that peg to bitcoin as an underlying collateral – have also been returned. The sum of these is worth around $4 million at bitcoin's current price.      Curiously, the hacker did not return exactly the same balance of assets as were stolen, but returned some of the value in other types of tokens. All told, however, they handed back crypto assets worth roughly $24 million as of press time.

42383545,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9wsKv,1587441923,Facebook's 'Scaled Back' Libra Proposal Is More Dangerous Than You Think,"Lex Sokolin, a CoinDesk columnist, is Global Fintech co-head at ConsenSys, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based blockchain software company. The following is adapted from his Fintech Blueprint newsletter.      The war over money is reaching a new height.      And yet, the shape of what is to come has never been more obvious. I can't tell you how the cookie will crumble yet, but I can tell you the ingredients and the flavor. If you are not preparing for this world, your head is in the sand and you will miss a generational opportunity.      COVID-19 has made transparent the playbook of sovereign states and their macroeconomic responses. Students of history will know that money has always been an instrument of the State, and that debt is how you build an Empire. To wage war, you must borrow from the Iron Bank. Taxes are the royal lifeblood, and we are economic appendages for the body politic. In this frame, regulatory licensing is the granting of monopoly power over State privilege. Privilege enforced by the sword.      See also: Money Reimagined: Demand for USD Stablecoins Foreshadows Financial Disruption      At times it may be sufficient to regulate reserve banking and oversee money flows with inflation and unemployment targeting. You would bat away at technology upstarts trying to weasel their way into the financial rivers. But sometimes you need to hand out $2 trillion in bailout money for a quarantine that you have mandated. One hand takes, the other hand gives. Sometimes the giving hand allows PayPal, Intuit, and Square to direct money without traditional licensing, because they are faster and more efficient.      But sometimes the money runs out and you've killed all the small businesses anway.      Anyway.      The money seems to be doing some weird things these days, if you are a country. Like, some really weird things! For example, the money keeps trying to transform itself into private cash equivalents and hide out in blockchains. Strange new companies, which are definitely not licensed to lend and borrow, keep buying up money, putting it into a box, and launching tokenized versions of units of account. It's not even clear that it is companies doing this – sometimes it is just a bunch of open source-obsessed strangers on the internet.      About $3 billion of tokenized cash sweep, in large part on the Ethereum blockchain and used in trading and decentralized finance, now sits in crypto exchanges. Tether alone is $7 billion of market capitalization today (not all is on exchanges). This is a sign of people entering the ecosystem to access new financial instruments. Note, these are not investment trends. This is not about a stablecoin ever being worth more than one dollar per unit. Rather, it is about flows and where the money is going. This cash is the rounding error in your asset allocation. Cash should be 5-10 percent of your net worth depending on risk tolerance.      Meanwhile, Facebook and Silicon Valley startups with billions of users are also trying to reinvent money. As a country, you may have a few hundred million people here and there. But the technology platforms are global and far better coordinated than international political bodies. They have people's attentions and hearts; you just have taxes and the sword.      If you haven't seen it yet, the Libra Association released a second version of its white paper reflecting the input of regulators. The initial cut was focused on a technology council that issued a currency basket as an initial reserve, and then tech company users would contribute to that currency basket from across the world. Net interest income would flow to the council, yielding billions as balances reached trillions. The new cut is both more modest, and more dangerous.    That is precisely what makes it so dangerous and likely to be adopted.    The libra coin will be a mere basket (i.e., an allocation container) of underlying central bank digital currencies represented on the network (for my prior take on CBDCs, see here). This means there will be a digital dollar, a digital euro and a digital sterling all traveling on the Libra blockchain rails. This is analogous to today's stablecoins traveling on the Ethereum rails. The white paper update is less ambitious in that it will not create a new form of money, and that the Libra rails will be fully permissioned. There is no decentralization and self-sovereignty in this proposal.      And that is precisely what makes it so dangerous and likely to be adopted. You certainly have heard that many central banks across the world are looking into, or already deploying, various digital currencies. The candidate technologies are R3 Corda, IBM Fabric, Libra, and Ethereum (Hyperledger Besu+). No central bank wants the chaos of billions of users having unfettered access to the royal lifeblood of money. Access should be parsed, compliant and rigorous. It makes people safe. And it makes things orderly.      The Libra network is a strong candidate to subsume CBDC innovation, and see the launch of various regulated fiat coins on its protocol. The compliance bend highlighted above is not accidental. Features of public chains, like transparent audit and smart contracts language, are replicated and made available to licensed participants. If the crypto ecosystem thinks it will have exclusive rights to distribute small business loans or provide universal basic income in a post-COVID world, it is for a rude awakening on libra's launch. PayPal, Square and Intuit barely eked through to approval. Facebook will crowbar the wedge further in its favor. Binance and Coinbase will need to wait in line.      See also: Why This Global Crisis Is a Defining Moment for Stablecoins      The East is using the same playbook, just with more purpose and efficiency. Unlike the girations of animal spirits in American and European stock markets, blockchain rails are being laid by China. Innovation, digital transformation and national growth are core priorities for the Communist Party. Hundreds of billions of dollars are directed towards R&D and experimental technology, the type of technology American regulators see as a systemic threat to sovereign systems. Further, that technology is exported to the smaller Asian economies and given as infrastructure to EMEA. China has just launched the BSN Alliance, a supergroup to rival libra. Members include government powerhouses like the State Information Center, as well as fintechs like Ant Financial, Tencent, and Ping An, which have blockchains that will eventually plug into this group. For example, Ant runs ""Open Chain"" (irony of ironies!), which was just released to SMEs and developers. Some public chains, like Ethereum and EOS, will also be accessible through intermediation.    Interestingly, the BSN is not focused on one particular protocol or network, but instead on a multi-protocol integration layer that allows developers to build Web3 applications above all these infrastructures. So you might build a single application into APIs that write data into Hyperledger Fabric or Ant Open Chain, and abstract away the complexity beneath. The upside is efficiency and an ability to quickly deploy software. The downside is that you are using software with compliance and audit tools built by the CCPhttps://www.bsnbase.com/main/serviceNetworkLeague.    That contrasts with what ConsenSys and Codefi are trying to do. We are working on APIs and developer tools that let anyone use the open, permissionless Ethereum to build decentralized financial machines. Already, Infura provides developers a gateway to deploying on Ethereum, and MetaMask gives access to a massive footprint of users. To get millions of people writing code, a simplifying toolkit is needed. I'd rather have the free market build it, than it be designed and managed as a government service.
