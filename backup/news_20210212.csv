42385944,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBPHuH,1613170879,5 Takeaways From Chia Network's New White Paper,"It will take 21 years for the rest of the world to mine as much of the Chia (XCH) cryptocurrency as the company behind it will have on the day its mainnet launches next month.      ""We believe that chia, a new digital currency built on our new blockchain with radically different features and security than other digital currencies, will ultimately deliver on the promises of 'magic internet money,'"" the company argues in its first version of a new business white paper released on Wednesday.      The size of the pre-mine is one notable revelation from the paper, in which Chia also announced its mainnet will launch on March 17 or earlier. Farmers (the network's equivalent of bitcoin miners) will be able to begin farming immediately. The network's cache of pre-mined XCH, however, will be governed using a traditional format: Chia plans to take its company public.      Chia was founded by Bram Cohen, the creator of BitTorrent, one of the most influential protocols on the internet. The company he founded was later sold to the Tron Foundation in 2018.      Chia first announced its intention to go public via the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's so-called mini-IPO in 2018, but the decentralized web startup Blockstack won out as the pioneer there, raising $23 million under Regulation A+ in 2019. Last year, Chia raised a fresh round of $5 million in funding led by Slow Ventures.      Plans have shifted slightly since then, with the company now planning to, one way or another, take its offering to a national stock exchange where it can be traded by the public and the company will be subject to the same transparency as any publicly traded company.      One of Chia's early backers was AngelList co-founder Naval Ravikant, who told CoinDesk in an email, ""I backed Chia because I've known Bram for a long time and he is one of the greatest living protocol designers (BitTorrent), right up there with Satoshi and Vitalik.""      Chia has previously articulated its technical vision, a consensus model called Proof of Space and Time (PoST). This new paper articulates Chia's vision for sustainability.      Chia's president and COO, Gene Hoffman, told CoinDesk that the public should control more XCH than the company much earlier than 21 years and that the token is not the critical component of the consensus model anyway.      ""Unlike most projects, coin ownership has nothing to do with the protocol – this is not Proof of Stake,"" Hoffman explained via email. ""The chart of ownership percentages of coins in the Whitepaper is a worst case as we expect to use shareholder distribution to migrate XCH out to a broad public shareholder base.""      CoinDesk went through the new Chia white paper with a fine-tooth comb.      Here are five key takeaways from Chia's new roadmap.    1. The blockchain is designed to make home mining feasible again    PoST relies on loading up unused computer storage space with strings of digits that farmers (what Chia calls blockchain validators) allow to be loaded on their computers. The more space, the more strings, the greater their chance of winning a block.    ""It is super simple. Just download the Machttps://download.chia.net/beta-1.27-macos/Chia-0.1.27.dmg or Windowshttps://download.chia.net/beta-1.27-win64/ChiaSetup-0.1.27.exe version and double click,"" Hoffman told CoinDesk. ""I’m pretty sure this will be the easiest cryptocurrency to validate for normal people ever.""    Other blockchains take a similar approach, such as Spacemesh. And Filecoin also seeks to capitalize on unused storage space.      In its testnet phases, Chia has reached as many as 1,700 nodes already, which is very likely to indicate something about interest in running a node when mainnet launches next month. Its public chat channel on Keybase has almost 4,000 people in it.    2. Chia favors predictable, continuous inflation over a hard cap    Bitcoin maxis fixate on the hard cap, but Chia argues that it's not a fixed amount that matters so much as a predictable amount. Chia has no cap, but it's also not going to surprise holders with unanticipated emissions.      ""Being able to directly calculate a shared expectation of the total supply at any given time gives much the same financial and peace of mind benefit,"" the white paper argues.      As noted, the company will start the mainnet with 21 million XCH, a nod to bitcoin, and farmers can start earning it right away. While it will take 21 years for the supply to double via farming, Hoffman knows that it will be very close in only six years. Then emissions will slow down considerably under the halving schedule.      By then, it's likely that the company will have sold or airdropped a considerable amount of XCH.    3. Plans to embrace regulators, particularly by leading with a company that has public reporting requirements    ""We have seen the scams and farces that have come before our project in this space and we will instead embrace the regulators,"" the white paper states. ""It should not be controversial that investors deserve protection through public disclosure and certainly the public shouldn’t be sold investments without that legally required transparency.""      By going with a public listing, Chia will essentially allow backers to treat its equity as an exchange-traded fund (ETF) for the XCH cryptocurrency. That's because the company's chief asset will be a considerable pre-mine (or pre-farm, in Chia lingo) of 21 million XCH that will be held for the company and is slated to be used for advancing the network.      ""It’s owned by the company and subject to significant corporate controls that will only get more teeth as and when we go public,"" Hoffman said. The provisions the company is committed to require it to only use its stash of XCH in ways that benefit XCH holders.      ""We can use the pre-farm to raise capital that only dilutes the shareholders and not the farmers,"" Hoffman noted.    4. The Chia blockchain has lots of native features that should make familiar crypto applications easier to trust and build    Chia comes with a number of features built in from the get-go that may increase trust and safety for users.      Here are a few described in the white paper that jumped out.    Clawback escrow: ""Withdrawal clawback escrow adds a time period in which the sender can claw back the funds after the initial transfer moves onto the blockchain.""  Slow paper wallet: ""Slow paper wallets allow you to store a smart transaction that’s capable of starting a time delayed process to recover your funds in your hot wallet but it is not a duplicate of your private key.""  Colored coins: Ethereum's ERC-20 coins are what colored coins were back when they were still a concept. ""Chia coloured coins can be used to create ephemeral value and thus applications on the Chia blockchain don’t generally require flash loans. This has been one of the achilles heels of DeFi on Ethereum.""    Flash loans have been the key to attacks on decentralized finance projects such as bZx, Harvest and Yearn Finance.    5. Chia is skeptical about proof-of-stake's security against nation-states and other threats    ""Their assumptions are inferior as they tend to cause centralization and are not as robust as Nakamoto consensus under international geopolitical pressure,"" the white paper says of proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains (after dismissing private, permissioned blockchains out of hand).      The problem with proof-of-work (PoW), Chia contends, is that it burns too much energy. Nevertheless, Chia also writes in the new white paper that its technology complements bitcoin, the largest PoW network.      But PoS, which Ethereum is moving toward, is another matter. Chia does not think the safety of this model is adequate. The white paper contends, ""A considerable amount of effort is being expended attempting to solve what we believe are intractable problems with Proof of Stake as an alternate strategy to use less electricity securing public blockchains.""      It cites three key issues: centralization, where tokens tend to concentrate among a few giant holders; long-range attacks, where the history of the chain can be revised more easily than in PoW because there is no, well, work (to speak of) in PoS; and the inability of PoS networks to recover from a 51% attack.      It remains to be seen until there is real value on the line, but the hope is that PoST can lower the energy footprint of ""magic internet money"" without sacrificing the censorship resistance and decentralization that makes cryptocurrency so appealing to the cypherpunk-inclined and those dealing with unreliable nation-state currencies.      That's the long term.      In the immediate term, Chia aims to scale what's worked about crypto so far and build on it in a way that's accessible for everyone. The white paper states:    ""Someday we all might buy coffee in San Francisco with chia, but for now we think banks and governments and De-Fi collectives will use it to build new financial technology, solve cross border payments, and invent a new future that doesn’t require trusting so many middle men.""",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | YFI,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/02/12/5-takeaways-from-chia-networks-new-white-paper,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6eeaecaafb70e1d9f420e134ccd39ee685e6d0bc-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Slipping less than 1% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $46,286 to $48,925    Much of bitcoin’s choppy price action could be attributed to futures deleveraging as eager bulls piled into long trades expecting a swift breakout to $50,000 or higher. Funding rates for perpetual bitcoin futures have steadily increased through February, according to market data collected by Skew, with some funding rates reaching their highest levels in the past 12 months.      High positive funding rates signal an increase in long positions, whereas negative rates indicate a more bearish sentiment.

42385946,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBPI1p,1613151762,Money Reimagined: Musk Masters the Attention Economy,"Welcome to Money Reimagined.      Well, this past week felt historic. As bitcoin surged to all-time highs and found its way into TV studios and onto newspaper front pages, it felt like we’d crossed the chasm and gone mainstream. This happened in predictably weird and wild ways, with memes and attention-grabbing stunts – as discussed in the column below. Regardless, it seemed like no one could stop talking about bitcoin.      Ethereum had a big week, too. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange launched ether futures, which helped the token hit all-time highs as well. And the buzz around decentralized finance (DeFi) and nonfungible tokens (NFTs) just got louder.      All of that activity is putting ever more stress on the Ethereum network, where transaction costs – in the form of “gas fees'' – are surging (see below). There’s an urgent need, in other words, for the scalability promised by Ethereum’s long-awaited 2.0 upgrade.      That’s what Sheila Warren and I discussed in this week’s episode of our “Money Reimagined” podcast. We asked Danny Ryan, a key Ethereum core researcher and communicator, to give us the lowdown on what’s happening with the massive upgrade, and more.      Have a listen. After reading the newsletter below.    Elon's masterful meme rally    Are we not entertained?      When news broke Monday that Elon Musk’s Tesla had invested $1.5 billion in bitcoin, it capped off weeks of cryptic crypto tweets from the colorful CEO and it conveniently distracted people from some not-so-positive news about his company. As he set off a massive bitcoin price surge, he proved that for all his talents as an entrepreneur, Musk’s greatest skill lies in mastering the “attention economy.”      In the attention economy, everybody – literally, all of us in the user-generated world of social media – is competing for the one scarce commodity that digital technology cannot replicate into abundance: our time. The attention we give to entertainment and information is in scarce supply; command of it dictates how money and power is distributed across the internet.      Musk and others of his ilk – think Dave Portnoy, Kim Kardashian or Donald J. Trump [no social link available anymore] – are the ones winning this competition. They’ve developed giant audiences and have figured out how to deploy shareable memes, sexy images or shock commentary to trigger dopamine releases among their followers, whether it’s from amusement, anger, arousal or some other emotion.      Along the way, their hyper-engaged communities share their leader’s work, creating viral effects and, ultimately, inspiring people to buy things: stocks, country club memberships, celebrity-branded perfume or crypto tokens. This is how the game is played, how the dominance of messages and their social distribution is converted into money and power.      Now, more and more of these attention masters are turning their virality machines to crypto. The celebrity impact of Mark Cuban, Gene Simmons, Snoop Dogg and Lindsay Lohan each separately had a noticeable impact on certain crypto assets this past week. The winning meme in all that surely went to rapper Snoop Dogg, with a paean to dogecoin that included a shout-out to Musk:    Scarce attention meets digital scarcity    As Felix Salmon noted in his newsletter for Axios this week, crypto is made for this because it allows attention masters to essentially convert clicks, likes and shares into tangible rewards. The activity and enthusiasm they draw to a project creates buzz and steers buyers to tokens. In essence, they drive scarce-supply human attention into scarce-supply digital assets, a marriage that results in price gains.      This kind of behavior goes far beyond crypto. Attention economics has been a thing for some time, well before “meme investing” moves by Reddit group WallStreetBets’ two weeks ago fostered a powerful movement to drive up GameStop’s stock. (“The Attention Economy,” a book by Thomas Davenport and John Beck, appeared in 2001.) The use of viral, social network-driven communication is really the foundation of the information economy.      And it’s not necessarily a positive development. This business model creates massive social distortions and shifts incentives both for those who command power within the system and those who don’t.      Beyoncé can make $1 million from a single, short Instagram post and image. That’s a far more efficient way to generate money than the intense work that goes into a music album. How does that affect her priorities? (Note: the trade-off is quite different for the vast majority of musicians, who have nowhere near Queen Bey’s 165 million followers.)      Think also of Donald Trump and what he represents. I would argue his presidency wasn’t about political power in the traditional sense; it was a mechanism for amplifying his attention engagement power. His tweets seemed deliberately designed to manufacture outrage and division among both his millions of loyal supporters and his vehement opponents. The relentless, irresolvable arguments he fomented generated traffic and engagement, all of which he monetized in various ways.    Community = value    That crypto is fueled and buffeted by all this noise raises many issues. It’s not necessarily bad, but for those who believe in the technology’s potential, it does put into sharp relief some core questions about who gets to influence its development. Crypto prides itself on meritocracy: The best developers, the best ideas are supposed to win. It's not about reputation, seniority and definitely not celebrity. How do we square that ethos with all this unseemingly self-promotion?      On the negative side, a Musk-led rally looks and feels to some like an empty “pump and dump” moment, one that the Tesla impresario or anyone in his circle could exploit, leaving meme-following investors holding the bag. It’s not a good look for crypto generally.      But if you buy into the idea that bitcoin will one day be a reserve asset for companies and people, regardless of how it gets there, then Tesla’s purchase can be seen more positively. Musk is motivating masses of ordinary Joes in a process of democratization. Mass, social participation in these price rallies is a decentralizing force, simply because it diminishes the dominance of latecomer institutions.      What makes these arguments tricky is a circularity problem around where value comes from in crypto projects. Unlike a stock such as GameStop, where value will ultimately be dictated by expectations on whether the company can earn profits in the future, value in a cryptocurrency like bitcoin is intrinsically linked with the expansion of its user network. The wider the adoption, the bigger the network, the more is at stake, the more secure it is and the more it is accepted as a store-of-value and, perhaps eventually, as a medium of exchange.      Building a community is the single most important factor dictating value for a cryptocurrency. So, in theory, an episode of meme-driven mass social vitality that stirs widespread engagement, as silly as it all might seem, can be a route to success.      At the end of the day, though, value can’t be separated from values, from the underlying narrative of why a crypto asset is worth owning. If a crypto community expands on the basis of a viral sales pitch alone, that diminishes and overshadows the core technical features of the project – say, Bitcoin’s censorship resistance or its principles of self-custody and peer-to-peer exchange.      Do meme rallies make regulators more or less likely to intervene in a crypto token’s growth? And what does that mean for the long-term goals many of us want to see occur, such as financial inclusion? Or is expansion and adoption, regardless of how it grows, the only thing that matters at this point?      What we can say is the technology itself doesn’t care what we do with it. It’s up to us to decide whether to ride with Elon “to the moon” or take a more prosaic path to mainstream acceptance.    A flippening 7,000 years in the making    As I’ve written before, it’s unfair to judge bitcoin’s aspirations to become a “digital gold” store-of-value by its current, volatile price performance. It will take time for bitcoin to become accepted widely enough as a universal reserve asset, much as it surely took gold a long time to become a widely accepted currency thousands of years ago. Bitcoin is not yet digital gold. It is becoming digital gold.      The writer Grant Bartel has come up with a simple way of tracking that becoming: a proxy called “Flip Progress” that measures bitcoin’s value versus gold based on market capitalization. This is from his bitcoinflips.gold website.      What’s striking, of course, is the acceleration. At 7%, the flip progress ratio still has a long way to go. But when compared to the 1% ratio it held a year ago, it suggests a real shift in narrative could be occurring.    The Conversation: ETH gas fees    While bitcoiners, dogecoiners and NFTers were obsessing with Elon Musk, Snoop Dogg and Gene Simmons this week, the “Degens” driving the DeFi craze on Ethereum were consumed with another topic: gas fees. Surging activity means that the already overburdened Ethereum blockchain is becoming even more congested. And when that happens, the miners who run the computational network start to rake in higher fees as users jack up rates to complete transactions.      DeFi enthusiast @JeanneDeBit put the math problem of high gas fees in stark terms:      And then she offered a rationalization, which, although in jest, was quite spot on. Fees are indeed a form of natural, on-chain regulation. They add friction to the system to keep activity within the bounds of capacity.      Meanwhile, Messari CEO Ryan Selkis, offered a different take: that, if you’re smart, you can join the “yield farmers” who play the DeFi market to profit on interest rate arbitrage opportunities while the bigger issue of Ethereum fees works itself out.

42385942,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBPHzJ,1613150730,"Blockchain Bites: Canada Approves Bitcoin ETF, Options Markets Not Pricing for $100K BTC","Editor’s Note: Welcome to the year of the Ox. Blockchain Bites will not publish on President’s Day, Monday, Feb. 15.    Three stories  Bull market buzz    The first bitcoin exchange-traded fund in North America has been approved by Canada’s securities regulator, a move some commenters see as opening the door for the U.S. to follow. The U.S. government has been hesitant to approve a bitcoin ETF product, which tracks the price of bitcoin and is traded on a stock exchange, due to bitcoin’s supposedly shallow liquidity and risks the asset could be manipulated.      Bitcoin miners earned a record $4.06 million in just 60 minutes yesterday, according to Glassnode data. The majority of those proceeds came from the bitcoin subsidy – 6.25 BTC issued roughly every 10 minutes – though some $47,000 was collected in network fees.      Bitcoin options market sees a 12% probability of prices rising above $100,000 by the end of December, according to a mathematical metric called the Black Scholes formula. It looks at strike prices, call option prices, the actual asset and U.S. Treasurys to determine the fair price of an option’s contract.    Everybody wants in?    PayPal CEO Dan Schulman said the payments giant is looking to become a CBDC distributor, if a central bank digital currency ever launches. “You think about how many [digital wallets] we’re going to have in the next two, three or five years, and we’re a perfect complement to central banks and governments to distribute those digitized forms of currency,” Schulman said at the company’s investor day.      Wall Street suits are pressuring their employers to move into crypto, according to CNBC. In response to internal questions, JPMorgan Chase co-President Daniel Pinto reportedly said the bank would consider bitcoin trading if customer demand was “there,” which “I’m sure it will be at some point.”      Miami Mayor Francis Suarez has floated everything from a bitcoin city treasury to paying employees in the crypto. Yesterday, however, city commissioners tapped the brakes on these ambitious plans to study their impact first. Commissioners did vote to launch education campaigns in English, Spanish and Creole to inform people about crypto.      Figure Technologies, a blockchain lending startup, is moving to set up a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), aka a “blank check” company. The firm, Figure Acquisition Corp. I, will raise $250 million to take a competitive startup public.    Around the world    Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced Thursday it has put plans to regulate cryptocurrencies on hold in light of the central bank’s decision to ban them, according to a report by the Guardian Nigeria. This follows a meeting yesterday where Nigeria’s Senate summoned the country’s top financial regulators to speak about the bill, which had received public pushback.      India will give crypto holders a three-to-six month window to cash out, if a proposed ban on cryptocurrency goes through. The Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, floated this year, seeks to limit private currencies in the country and set up a framework for a national digital currency.      Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey announced Friday that he will partner with rapper Jay-Z and donate 500 bitcoin (~$23.6 million) to set up a new endowment trust supporting Africa and India. Separately, Dorsey donated $1 million to cryptocurrency policy think tank Coin Center, announced Wednesday.    At stake    Popping bubbles? Former CFTC Chairman Christopher Giancarlo cleared the record on the commodity regulator’s role in popping the 2017 bitcoin bull market this morning on CoinDesk TV.      CoinDesk previously reported that the Trump administration acted to puncture the 2017 bubble by clearing the way for futures products.      “We saw a bubble building and we thought the best way to address it was to allow the market to interact with it,” Giancarlo said in late 2019. He said the launch of bitcoin futures “would have the impact of popping the bitcoin bubble. And it worked.”      These comments have led to a conspiracy that U.S. regulators are antagonistic to the growth of the cryptocurrency industry. Similar questions arised earlier this week, after the Chicago Mercantile Exchange launched the nation’s first regulated ether (ETH) futures.      Giancarlo tempered these fears this morning. Adding that security and commodity regulators don’t have the authority, nor the ability, to have such a heavy hand in capital markets.      The story is slightly more complicated. Derivatives, Giancarlo, argued are an essential part of any mature market.      “The ability to short a market is an essential maturatization point in the development of any market,” he said, adding that the in most modern market asset prices are not set in spot markets, but in a higher order financial level. “The institutional role in bitcoin has made it into a truly investment grade asset.”      To the extent that bitcoin futures did deflate the bubble, it was just a matter of good old capitalist price finding.      “[Derivatives] brought the price of bitcoin back in correlation to its fundamental cost of production,” Giancarlo said. “In 2017, bitcoin had broken away from those fundamentals.”      So what does Giancarlo think about today’s frothy markets? He didn’t address the question directly, but we can again turn to the market itself.      As CoinDesk markets reporter Omkar Godbole noted, derivative traders see a low probability of the market to inflate past six figures by the end of the year.      “With the extreme volatility of the past two months, the market isn’t showing a lot of conviction on how bitcoin will trade for the rest of the year,” Sui Chung, CEO of CF Benchmarks, told Godbole.

42433613,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOzfVh,1613140832,Former Bitcoin Developer Mike Hearn Steps Down From Enterprise Blockchain Firm R3,"Mike Hearn, the lead platform engineer at enterprise blockchain builder R3, is stepping down from his role at the company, CoinDesk has learned.      Hearn will stay on at R3, but only in the capacity of a technical adviser, according to a memo sent to company staff Friday.      Hearn has long harbored ambitions to broaden his range and start new projects, the memo said.      “Mike’s plans include his own projects, as well as becoming technical advisor to the R3 executive committee. To support the former, he’ll become CEO of his new firm, as well as transitioning to his ongoing R3 advisory role,” it said.      Hearn, who joined R3 in 2015, was instrumental in the creation of the Corda platform with CTO Richard G. Brown. Most recently, Hearn oversaw the rollout of the Conclave system built using Intel’s SGX technology.      “We all wanted this done right and care tremendously about the ongoing success of Corda and Conclave. So, these past few months, I worked in lockstep with our executive team to ensure a smooth transition to my new advisory role,"" Hearn told CoinDesk via email. ""As a result, Conclave launched on time to significant interest and anticipation, a new technical leadership team is in place to manage the product on a day-to-day basis, and I remain a part of the R3 brain trust.”      Before joining R3, Hearn was one of leading early developers building Bitcoin’s core software, and he is one of the few people to have had email conversations with bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. He quit the project in a very public way in early 2016. Prior to that, he was a senior software engineer and tech lead at Google.

42433620,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOzflh,1613140176,First Mover: Bullish ($1 Million) Bitcoin Forecast as Year of Ox Begins,"Editor's Note: Happy Chinese Lunar New Year! First Mover will not publish on Monday, February 15, which is Presidents' Day in the U.S. Cryptocurrency markets will be open, as they always are.    Price Point    Bitcoin (BTC) was lower, after pushing early Friday to an all-time high price of $48,925, based on CoinDesk pricing.      Market activity was quiet due to the Lunar New Year celebrations across Asia and the upcoming Presidents' Day holiday in the U.S. on Monday, according to Craig Erlam, senior market analyst for the foreign-exchange brokerage Oanda. (It's the Year of the Ox, by the way, which is seen by some traders as bullish, in case you missed the story last week by CoinDesk's Muyao Shen.)      In traditional markets, U.S. stock futures were lower, with one investor telling Bloomberg News that ""investor exuberance has somewhat waned."" Gold weakened 0.5% to $1,817 an ounce.    The News    JPMORGAN FEELS BITCOIN BURN: JPMorgan employees hounded senior trading-division management during an internal town hall meeting about when the largest U.S. bank might get into bitcoin, CNBC reported.      RESERVE CURRENCY STATUS? ECB President Christine Lagarde said it's ""very unlikely"" that central banks will hold bitcoin in the near future. ""I would say it's out of the question,"" Lagarde said during a conference call hosted by The Economist.      GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT: U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissioner Hester Peirce, sometimes known as ""Crypto Mom"" because of her sanguine views on the digital-asset industry, said the country's capital markets are ready for a bitcoin exchange-traded product. The SEC has refused to approve a bitcoin exchange-traded fund despite multiple applications. People are already eager to trade a bitcoin ETP, and ""so if we don’t give them the natural way, which I think would be an ETP, they are going to look for other (less optimal) ways to do it,"" Peirce said Thursday on CoinDesk TV.      CANADA ISN'T WAITING: The first North American bitcoin ETF was approved Thursday by the Ontario Securities Commission. ""Perhaps they’re normal and SEC too conservative,” tweeted Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg. “Either way U.S. usually follows shortly after.”      FINANCE EXECS DEMUR ON BITCOIN: Top financial executives at Verizon, Cisco Systems and Mozilla see risks and accounting challenges in putting corporate money into bitcoin, the Wall Street Journal reported. Such anecdotes challenge the investment narrative that the cryptocurrency is set to benefit from a wave of new demand from companies.      BAIR'S A BEAR: Bitcoin prices are at ""nosebleed levels,"" said Sheila Bair, former chairwoman of the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and now chairwoman of the government-owned mortgage-finance company Fannie Mae. “Stay away from it,” she said late Wednesday in a Bloomberg Radio interview. “It’s volatile. It’s at nosebleed levels now. We don’t know how sustainable that is.”      INDIA GRACE PERIOD: Policymakers in India will provide a transition period if a proposed ban on cryptocurrency usage is passed as expected, Bloomberg reported. After that, cryptocurrency usage in all aspects will be banned via a new law set to be introduced in the current parliamentary session via the Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021.    Market Moves    How bitcoin gets to $1 million in 11 years, in one analyst's scenario      First Mover ran some back-of-the-envelope math earlier this week to illustrate just how scarce the supply of bitcoin might be for the bevy of new institutional investors and corporate treasurers now ostensibly considering an allocation to the cryptocurrency, following Tesla's announcement earlier this week of a $1.5 billion purchase.      Now comes Charlie Morris, chief investment officer of ByteTree Asset Management, who has run his own calculations along similar lines, making First Mover's amateur efforts look like the doodlings of a toddler.      Some 363,500 bitcoins will be awarded this year to cryptocurrency miners for helping to secure the blockchain network, Morris estimates. He assumes the miners ""will presumably sell most because that is their business.""      Further extrapolation leads to a figure of $18.17 billion: This is the amount of new bitcoin demand that would be needed this year to ""sustain a $50,000 BTC price,"" according to Morris.      For context, Morris writes that gold exchange-traded funds attracted $41 billion last year. ""Given the offsetting flows into bitcoin at the time, the evidence points towards gold investors switching into bitcoin,"" Morris writes. ""If bitcoin can attract $41 billion in 2021, as gold did last year, expect to see an average bitcoin price of $100K.""      It's pretty bullish, in other words, but not crazily farfetched. As First Mover reported earlier this week, $2.02 billion has already flowed into bitcoin-focused investment products this year, based on a report Tuesday from the digital-asset manager CoinShares. And the CoinShares report doesn’t even cover demand from investors or corporate treasurers who may be buying bitcoin directly through their own accounts, or purchases from retail traders who are looking for a piece of the action.      Factor in the Bitcoin blockchain's quadrennial halvings, where miner rewards are cut in half, and the investment hurdle gets lower every four years. ""It keeps on falling thereafter, meaning that high prices are easier to sustain in the future than today,"" Morris writes.      So what does that mean for bitcoin prices? Morris figures a $1 million price for bitcoin is reasonable by 2044 at a rate of $41 billion of new inflows per year. Bitcoin will hit the $1 million mark by 2036 if consumer price inflation averages 2.5%, or by 2032 if inflation averages 5%. That's just 11 years from now, representing a 20-fold gain from current price levels.    Mastercard/BNY Mellon Reax    Gavin Smith, CEO, Panxora Group: “BNY Mellon’s and Mastercard’s entry into the cryptocurrency space moves bitcoin two huge steps closer to mainstream acceptance.""      David Mercer, CEO, LMAX Group: ""Financial institutions are now preparing to follow their clients.""      Don Guo, CEO, Broctagon Fintech Group: ""We hope that the increasing adoption will urge the industry to prioritize liquidity provision through improving crypto infrastructure. This will ensure both existing and new participants consistently have access to the best prices and that the industry reaches the next level of maturity.""      Edward Moya, senior market analyst, Oanda: ""Improved mainstream acceptance for cryptocurrencies are completely easing most regulatory concerns for now.""      Anthony Pompliano, Morgan Creek Digital, in a tweet: ""Eventually, every company will join the revolution.""    Bitcoin Watch    Number of large bitcoin addresses swells, CoinDesk's Omkar Godbole writes      Bitcoin's blockchain data supports the popular narrative that bitcoin's rally has been fueled by increased institutional demand.    According to data source CoinMetrics, the number of bitcoins locked in the addresses holding between 1,000 to 10,000 BTC has increased significantly since late 2020. The group now holds over $5 million in coins, or 30% of bitcoins' total supply. That's a sign of increased participation by high net worth individuals and institutions.  Retailers, too, have participated in the rally, with addresses holding between 0 and 10 BTC gaining share since mid-2020.  Token Watch    Ether (ETH): Joel Kruger, cryptocurrency strategist at exchange LMAX Digital, offered CoinDesk's Muyao Shen some price points to watch: “A break above [$1,840] will open the door for a test of massive resistance at $2,000, which represents a critical psychological barrier and measured move upside extension,” Kruger said. “We see the first level of support at $1,680, with a break below to take the immediate pressure off the topside and open the door for a correction back down towards the $1,500 area.”      Avalanche (AVAX): Network comes to a near halt after a “bug in the cross-chain functionality” failed under high loads, according to Avalanche developer team on Reddit. The AVAX token's price has jumped 15-fold already this year.      Tether (USDT): Dollar-linked stablecoin's market cap surpasses $30B.    Economy in Transition    REMOTE WORKING STICKS: Another year of remote working looms as companies delay office-reopening plans to September or beyond, in many cases refusing to commit to specific dates, the Wall Street Journal reports. As First Mover wrote in November: ""A secular transition to commuting-by-Internet might be taking place, perhaps one of the biggest labor-force transformations since the industrial revolution, which lured people to cities.... Governments and central banks are probably going to have to provide a lot of aid and stimulus to assure the transition goes smoothly, that society holds together, that people can manage.""      U.S. DEBT > 100% OF GDP: The government's debt load is on track to exceed the size of the entire U.S. economy this year, largely due to the $4 trillion in emergency spending approved since March to fight the pandemic and stimulate output. The debt is forecast to reach 107% of gross domestic product in a decade.    Opinions and Observations    PAY NOW OR PAY LATER: Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser for the German financial behemoth Allianz, writes in column for Bloomberg Opinion: ""What is favorable for policy and markets now increases future risks, starting with financial instability. The more Wall Street surges ahead in the short term, the harder it is for eventually improving economic conditions to validate the ever more elevated asset prices in an orderly manner.""",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/12/first-mover-bullish-1-million-bitcoin-forecast-as-year-of-ox-begins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/47c2ce425a23a919cdf6e9efe0bbf85de95528e5-2048x1751.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to an Elliptic blog post, the site's pseudonymous founder, JokerStash, said the site will cease operations on Feb. 15. Joker’s Stash was founded in 2014 and quickly rose to prominence.      ""The revenues earned by Joker’s Stash can be estimated from the value of incoming cryptocurrency payments to its wallet, as seen on the blockchain,"" wrote Elliptic co-founder Tom Robinson. ""Since 2015 almost $400 million in bitcoin was sent to the marketplace, with annual sales peaking at $139 million in 2018. Sales dropped over the next two years, reflecting a broader downtrend in carding activity.""

42433618,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOzfjh,1613135401,"Bitcoin Starting to Lead FX Markets, Analysis of Tesla Reaction Shows: Report","In a sign of continued maturity as a macro asset, bitcoin now looks to be leading the price action in the foreign exchange markets (FX).      ""The dollar slid back to flat on the day on Monday after a surge in bitcoin to record highs foiled the U.S. currency's attempt to rally back from [U.S. nonfarm] payrolls-inspired losses in the previous session,"" a Reuters article published earlier this week says.      The article claims that the Tesla-led rally in bitcoin (BTC) helped EUR/USD (euro-dollar exchange rate) extend Friday's gains in the wake of dismal eurozone investor confidence data.      A closer look at the two markets' price action shows that EUR/USD, the most liquid currency pair globally, tracked bitcoin higher following the Tesla news.      EUR/USD broke out of a descending channel (above left) at 14:00 UTC on Monday, signaling a continuation of Friday's rise from 1.1990 to 1.2040, which was fueled by the dismal U.S. nonfarm payrolls (labor market) data.      Notably, the currency pair's breakout happened at least an hour after Tesla news propelled bitcoin to new highs above $42,000. The U.S. electric car maker disclosed its bitcoin investments worth $1.5 billion, validating the cryptocurrency's appeal as a reserve asset.      It does appear as though FX traders sold dollars, lifting EUR/USD higher, as the greenback took a hit against bitcoin, a perceived inflation hedge/digital gold. It's worth noting that macro factors such as Eurozone’s slow vaccine delivery and relatively tepid economic recovery favored a drop in EUR/USD.      Both bitcoin and EUR/USD have remained largely bid ever since. The cryptocurrency set a new peak price of $48,925 early Friday, while EUR/USD is now trading above 1.2100.      While it may be too early to call bitcoin a lead indicator for the FX markets, analysts are confident that the cryptocurrency is heading in that direction.      ""While I certainly think this may be where we're headed, bitcoin still has some more maturing to do before we get there,"" Joel Kruger, a currency strategist at LMAX Digital, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.      Also read: Bitcoin Options Market Sees Low Odds of Sky-High Rally in 2021      The crypto community considers bitcoin as a better store of value and medium of exchange than the U.S. dollar and fiat currencies in general.

Miners collected a record single-hour revenue of $4.06 million during the 60 minutes to 17:00 UTC on Thursday, according to data provided by the blockchain analytics firm Glassnode. Transaction fees accounted for more than $47,000 of the record hourly revenue.      Miners use powerful computers to solve complex mathematical problems to mine blocks and confirm transactions on the publicly distributed ledger. As a reward for their services, miners receive newly created bitcoins along with transaction processing fees.      Currently, miners are paid 6.25 bitcoin (BTC) for every block mined. The number was reduced by 50% in May 2020 via a process called mining reward halving, which is repeated every four years.      While hourly income reached a lifetime high on Thursday, daily revenue hit a three-year high of $50.78 million earlier this week, marking at least a fivefold increase since mid-October, reflecting the rise in the price of BTC during that period.      Income earned through transaction fees has also increased substantially over the past few months, reaching a $9.14 million on Feb. 9.      Turnovers have risen sharply, with bitcoin's price rallying by nearly 400% to record levels above $48,000 in the past four months.

The blank-check firm seeks to raise $250 million, according to the prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and will be called Figure Acquisition Corp. I.      Figure Technologies issues mortgages and loans, using its own blockchain, called Provenance, to automate portions of the process. It was founded in 2018 and raised $220 million from Ribbit Management, DST Capital, RPM Ventures, Nimble Ventures and Morgan Creek, the prospectus noted.      Cagney would be the chairman of the new company's board.      Figure is the latest crypto firm setting up a SPAC, which have been used as vehicles to bring companies to the public market. Digital asset custodian and derivatives provider Bakkt went public through a similar method earlier this year. Other companies such as Coinbase have instead chosen to go public through a direct listing.      Figure's prospectus said it expects ""to identify companies that have compelling growth potential"" and various other characteristics that it can acquire to go public.      ""We expect to differentiate ourselves through our … capacity to leverage proven and scaled blockchain platform which drives operational, technological and marketing improvements to maximize the growth potential of businesses,"" the prospectus said.      The prospectus did not say that Figure Technologies itself would go public through the SPAC.      According to SEC documents, Figure filed its form S-1, initially announcing the SPAC, on Feb. 3, with an updated filing going live on Thursday. A draft registration statement was filed in mid-January.      Figure also filed to become a bank last year, applying for a charter through the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in November, though it's yet to receive approval.

According to a decision document on Thursday, Purpose Investment's receipt of approval from the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) was filed under a Multilateral Instrument passport system in multiple Canadian jurisdictions.      Those territories include British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador, Northwest Territories, Yukon and Nunavut.      While multiple close-ended bitcoin funds have been listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, such as the ones listed by Canadian investment manager 3iQ, they differ from an ETF. In the case of an ETF, units are issued on a continuous basis while close-ended funds issue units only at their initial public offering and reopenings.      The fund seeks to replicate the performance of the price of bitcoin minus fees and expenses, according to a fact sheet posted online by Canada-based asset manager Purpose Investments. The ETF won't speculate on short-term changes in the price of bitcoin.      According to the fact sheet, the fund is targeting investors who are seeking long-term capital growth and an attractive risk-adjusted rate of return and who can tolerate ""high risk.""      ETFs contain a basket of investments, similar to mutual funds, but trade on exchanges much in the same way stocks do. An ETF's risk is based on what kind of underlying assets it has, and the bitcoin ETF is considered ""high risk.""      Those seeking a ""steady source of income"" from their investment are advised against buying into the fund.      The fund's expenses consist of a management fee as well as operating and trading costs whereby the annual management fee is currently set at 1% of the value of bitcoin. The fund is so new that its operating expenses and trading costs haven't been provided yet.
