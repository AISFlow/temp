42401098,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLiRL,1518643241,DC Blockchain Hearing Sees Call for Congressional Commission,"Members of the U.S. House of Representatives got a crash course on blockchain today, with subcommittees of the Science, Space and Technology Committee meeting to hear testimony on the tech.  During the “Beyond Bitcoin: Emerging Applications for Blockchain Technology” hearing, the House Subcommittee on Research and Technology and the Subcommittee on Oversight asked a range of questions, primarily aimed at getting a sense of which use cases have attracted the most attention today – and could, in theory, wind up being used by the U.S. government itself.  Ultimately, the witnesses would recommend that Congress set up a legal framework which would encourage and, perhaps, even fund research into uses of the technology within the public sphere.  ""I would encourage Congress to commission a blockchain advisory group,"" said Aaron Wright, an associate clinical professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law and co-director of its Blockchain Project.  He later elaborated:  ""So the idea with the blockchain commission would be to provide a degree of uniformity and a unified approach to the numerous regulatory decisions. Some issues raised by the witnesses today – there’s privacy issue, identity issues, consumer protection, commodities laws, and there’s competing interpretations that have been issued already by federal agencies, so the thought would be to standardize that.""  Applications, not regulations  The hearing pointedly sought to avoid a topic that has been a hot one, both in and outside of Washington, D.C.: regulation. While it was a subject that came up through witness testimony, chair Ralph Abraham (R-LA) said he wanted to focus on what he described as a potentially ""transformative"" technology.  To that end, the hearing called for examples of how the technology can be used, both in the private sector and by the federal government.  Representative Barbara Comstock (R.-VA) started listing use cases by noting that her personal information was likely stolen or compromised by a data breach at the Office of Personnel Management. As a result, she said she was “pleased” to hear about efforts to create more secure identity management platforms that uses blockchain as a means to encrypt data.  One notable topic of exploration came through Chris Jaikaran, a cybersecurity analyst from the Congressional Research Office, who discussed the tech's use for underpinning voting systems.  ""The blockchain doesn’t record the vote, it records the person, the identity, the voting. The vote itself is stored on another secure system,"" he explained.  Frank Yiannas, vice president of food safety, Walmart Inc., detailed his company's work with blockchain to the subcommittee members, explaining how the retail giant is using the tech to track food shipments.  Yiannas spoke on the pilot projects the retail giant had concluded already, explaining that blockchain has already seen success in helping track food supply chains.  He explained:  “In 2017, Walmart and IBM decided to trial a blockchain to track mangos from source to store … at the end of the trial, we proved we could cut down the time to trace food from seven days to 2.2 seconds. That’s food traceability at the speed of thought.”  Security concerns  While committee members seemed enthused on the idea of private-sector blockchains helping businesses solve problems, they shared concerns about using similar platforms to share government-related information. Representatives Clay Higgins (R-LA) and Ed Perlmutter (D-CO) in particular asked for clarification on how distributed ledgers would be secured from potential attackers.  Charles Romine, director of the Information Technology Lab at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), noted that 51 percent attacks and compromised computers could both disrupt a blockchain, but that these types of attacks would be less dangerous for large – and therefore powerful – networks.  One particular area that was honed in on is quantum computing, which some have warned could undermine the security of blockchain systems.  These concerns are being considered but are at least 15 to 30 years away from becoming a reality, Romine explained.  ""If there is a concerted effort to develop quantum computing, I believe we have a number of years before it reaches maturity – what we refer to as being cryptographically relevant.""  Looking ahead  As with any hearing before Congress, the natural question becomes: what comes next?  Prior to the hearing, aides to the committee downplayed the prospects of immediate action, though they floated the idea that the testimony on Wednesday could form the basis of work toward some kind of legislation around blockchain.  IBM's Jerry Cuomo prepared a list of potential actions Congress could take in order to provide more support for blockchain research. First and foremost, he recommended that the government should encourage projects which can directly impact the U.S.  Cuomo argued in favor of a ""thoughtful"" approach to legislation.  ""Perhaps most importantly, [Congress should] recognize the difference between blockchain’s use in new forms of currency from broader uses of blockchain when considering regulatory policy. Carefully evaluate policies established regarding cryptocurrencies to ensure that there will not be unintended consequences that stymie the innovation and development surrounding blockchain.""  Ultimately, it's tough to say whether Congress will move on such legislation anytime soon – especially considering the current political climate in the U.S. today – but the process likely moved one step closer through today's testimony.

42401101,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLiUI,1518639481,CFTC to Establish Crypto and DLT Committees,"The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)'s Technology Advisory Committee hosted back-to-back panels on cryptocurrencies, blockchain and regulation during its meeting Wednesday.  The meeting brought together influential figures from both the public and private sectors, with participants primarily raising issues related to markets, the regulation of the new technologies and the role of regulators in participating in the development of the technologies.  Indeed, the event had one tangible outcome from the get-go – just prior to the break, the committee approved the creation of two subcommittees, with one devoted to cryptocurrencies and the other on broader application of distributed ledgers in the finance space.  The event notably saw Brian Quintenz call for self-regulatory efforts around cryptocurrencies, a position he reportedly expressed during a pre-event press conference. He made a similar pitch at the Yahoo! Finance All Markets Summit: Crypto conference in New York last week.  Quintenz reiterated this position during his opening remarks, telling attendees:  ""The CFTC should not attempt to make value judgments about which new products are worthwhile and which are not – the markets, investors, and consumers need to decide that for themselves.""  Several panel participants – including those drawn from the ranks of the CFTC itself – ultimately argued that new regulations were required in order to accommodate use of the technology within the financial sector, particularly on the infrastructure front.  ""The futuristic visions of regulatory oversight must incorporate DLT as it continues to improve and mature,"" said Dan Busca, deputy director of the CFTC's Division of Market Oversight. ""Trying to adapt a system to meet regulations as an afterthought is often costly and inadequate.""  Busca later suggested that blockchain could be a potential tool for regulators, highlighting how market watchdogs would operate their own nodes on a distributed network and be fed information in real-time.  ""The evolution of DLT could allow regulators to access data seamlessly every time a trade is posted on a particular blockchain without the need for human intervention or intermediaries.""  This, in turn, would make the CFTC more ""nimble and efficient,"" Busca claimed.  Private sector perspective  Committee members from the private sector expressed mixed views on cryptocurrency and blockchain regulation and the extent to which regulators should involve themselves.  Charley Cooper, managing director of R3, appealed to regulators to boost their involvement in the blockchain and cryptocurrency industries, saying:  ""We would ask as passionately as possible for the U.S. regulators and members of the agencies of the government to become more active than you already are. I can tell you that there are federal governments around the world that are way outpacing the U.S. government. And that's a concern.""  Brian Knight, a senior research fellow at George Mason University's Mercatus Center, raised concerns about the expanding role of regulators in cryptocurrency and blockchain, and said such involvement could prove problematic.  ""If we're going to have the regulator serve as a kind of consultant, how do we make sure that's fair?"" Knight queried.  And, as demonstrated by its decision to form cryptocurrency and blockchain specialized subcommittees, the Technology Advisory Committee indicated that its exploration of the technologies will be ongoing and that it expects them to have a ""transformative impact on trading, markets and the entire global financial system.""

The 11-page release argues that the combination of risk management controls at the two firms, as well as the nascent state of that market, reduces those risks.  The service wrote:  ""So far Bitcoin futures volumes have been low, but CME and Cboe hope to tap into the investment community’s interest in the underlying asset. Bitcoin prices have been highly volatile, but we don’t expect this market risk to materially affect CME's or Cboe’s creditworthiness given the small volumes involved and strong risk management at the central counterparty clearing houses (CCPs).""  The report presents a combination of observations on the development of those futures markets to date, as well as an examination of the issues Moody's believes, are most pressing in this context, including the volatile price of bitcoin. That said, the report's authors say that moves to request higher margins for bitcoin futures trades helps lessen the risks.  ""Bitcoin’s price volatility presents particular risk management challenges for CCPs, making it more difficult to close out a defaulting clearing member’s exposures,"" the firm wrote. ""To manage this risk, both CME and Cboe set relatively high margins for Bitcoin futures trades to mitigate counterparty exposure, and have since upped margins from those they first presented to regulators. For now low volumes also limit potential losses to a CCP.""  This also goes for brokers who are offering access to bitcoin futures, Moody's goes on to argue – even if it's not entirely clear how those margins will be adjusted in the months to come. The report names TD Ameritrade and E*Trade in particular.  ""Clearing margins will remain in flux, and may rise rapidly and significantly in response to higher spot Bitcoin price volatility, and brokers will have to adhere to these changes.""

42401088,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLiJT,1518625218,Saudi Central Bank to Test Ripple Payments Tech,"Distributed ledger startup Ripple has struck a deal with Saudi Arabia's central bank on a pilot program that will see banks in the country trial the company's tech.  Announced today, the pilot with the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority marks the second central bank to work with the startup, coming after the Bank of England, the U.K.'s central bank, began working with Ripple last year. Word of the latest deal first emerged earlier this week following comments from CEO Brad Garlinghouse at the Blockchain Connect Conference in San Francisco.  ""This ground-breaking pilot program is the first of its kind to be launched by a central bank. Participating banks from the [Kingdom of Saudi Arabia] will use xCurrent to instantly settle payments sent into and out of the country, with greater transparency and lower costs,"" Ripple said.  That the banks in Saudi Arabia would look to pilot xCurrent is perhaps unsurprising given recent interest in the Ripple product by other notable financial institutions. Earlier this month, CoinDesk reported that Santander is in the process of rolling out a mobile payments app that uses the xCurrent tech (which does not rely on Ripple's XRP token), with Spain, Brazil, the U.K. and Poland serving as the initial markets for that release.  The announcement also comes a day after news emerged that UAE Exchange, a major remittance company in the United Arab Emirates, had signed on to use the startup's RippleNet product to manage cross-border payments.  Separate from the Saudi Arabia news are reports about tests being conducted by remittance giant Western Union, which confirmed in an earnings call yesterday that it is piloting the startup's tech. Fortune reported today that, per a spokesperson, the company is testing payments using XRP.  ""We are looking especially in the processing settlement and working capital optimization, also in the regulation part, on the compliance part on the blockchain capabilities,"" Western Union CEO Hikmet Ersek was quoted as saying by Bloomberg. ""And we do test, we do have some tests with Ripple.""  Ripple said as far back as 2015 that it was working with Western Union, though the remittance company didn’t comment at the time.

Citing Venezuela's recent introduction of the ""petro"" cryptocurrency as an example, Sigal Mandelker told the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association Anti-Money Laundering and Financial Crimes Conference that rogue regimes, terrorists and others use cryptocurrencies to ""exploit the financial system,"" ""hide their ill-gotten gains"" and ""finance their illicit activities.""  Mandleker went on to say that there is a lack of consistent international regulation of cryptocurrency ""providers"" with regard to anti-money laundering (AML) and combatting the financing of terrorism (CFT).  She told the conference:  ""The lack of AML/CFT regulation of virtual currency providers worldwide greatly exacerbates virtual currency's illicit financing risks. Currently, we are one of the only major countries in the world, along with Japan and Australia, that regulate these activities for AML/CFT purposes. But we need many more countries to follow suit, and have made this a priority in our international outreach.""  Mandleker further cautioned that a $110 million penalty levied at cryptocurrency exchange BTC-e last year for failing to register as a money transmitter was indicative of the Treasury's expectations and willingness to aggressively enforce regulation.  ""The company lacked basic controls to prevent the use of its services for illicit purposes,"" the undersecretary said.  ""As a result,"" she continued, ""they emerged as one of the principal means by which cyber criminals around the world laundered the proceeds of their illicit activity, facilitating crimes such as computer hacking and ransomware, fraud, identity theft, tax refund schemes, public corruption and drug trafficking.""  Mandleker encouraged regulators to ""supercharge"" their efforts to prevent financial crime and protect national security. She also stated that companies ""must do more"" against money laundering and the financing of terrorism in countries without regulation or with loosely enforced regulation.  ""You play a key role in countering the threats that we face,"" the undersecretary said, referring to cryptocurrency companies such as exchanges. ""The expectations you set for your customers, counterparties, and the countries in which you operate are critical to ensuring the transparency of the international financial system and keeping bad actors out.""

42401103,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLiWG,1518617703,Fork Confusion Propels Litecoin to 1-Month High Above $200,"Litecoin (LTC) is putting on a show today amid news a group of developers may seek to fork its blockchain, the fifth-largest by total value.  The cryptocurrency was last seen changing hands at $216, a one-month high, according to data service CoinMarketCap. Overall, LTC has appreciated by 33 percent in the last 24 hours, up over 100 percent from the Feb. 6 low of $106.94. Further, with the move, litecoin's market capitalization has jumped above $10 billion for the first time since Jan. 29.  Still, the reasons for the move may give investors pause.  LTC appears to be edging higher due to news of an upcoming fork called ""Litecoin Cash,"" which is promising new tokens to existing holders at block 1,371,111. For every 1 LTC held at block 1,371,111, holders will receive 10 ""LCC,"" according to the official website.  However, there is a notable contingent that is warning about the new cryptocurrency.  Litecoin founder creator Charlie Lee and the litecoin community have dismissed the project, calling it a ""scam"" meant to confuse litecoin owners. Bitcoin similarly boomed on the release of a rival blockchain called bitcoin cash last year, though there were perhaps more stark differences between the two technologies, both propelled by competing ideologies.  Closer analysis shows the LTC price increase has been bolstered by strong volumes from Coinbase's GDAX exchange, a sign less-savvy consumers may be active in the market.  However, questions about the fork aside, technical charts indicate the news may be enough to extend a rally in the flagging market.  Litecoin chart  The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows:  LTC has breached the falling trendline resistance on the back of a sharp rise in volumes. A high volume breakout indicates the rally is here to stay.  Short-term momentum studies indicate bullish setup: 5-day MA and 10-day MA are curled up in favor of the bulls.

42401095,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLiQM,1518616832,Crypto Is Now Fastest Growing Donation for Fidelity Charitable,"Cryptocurrency enthusiasts have proved quite charitable, at least as far as Fidelity Charitable is concerned.  Announced today, the global charity revealed it has received $69 million in cryptocurrency donations in 2017, making it the fastest-growing asset type accepted by the firm. According to Fidelity Charitable's annual report, the funds, which included donations in bitcoin and ether, came from 169 different donors.  The donations represent a tenfold increase since the organization started accepting bitcoin in late 2015, a figure that grew 140 percent faster than the other options (such as real estate, shares of LLCs and bags of grain) that Fidelity Charitable accepts as donations, according to the company's vice president Amy Pirozzolo.  Pirozzolo told CoinDesk:  ""It is one of the fastest growing assets that we are seeing wanting to be contributed to charity. Many people who own bitcoin or other forms of cryptocurrency do want to be philanthropic.""  But if that comes as a surprise, perhaps it shouldn't – donations have been one of the key use cases from cryptocurrency since the beginning.  In 2013, non-profit BitGive began helping other non-profits accept donations in bitcoin and shortly after, a handful of major names announced they would trial the idea. The following year, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase launched its own service designed to support non-profits.  Now, a cottage industry of consultants like Man on a Mission Consulting have popped up to streamline the process of allowing charities to accept this new type of value.  According to Man on a Mission founder Paul Lamb, ""I think there's a strong desire to accept not only bitcoin, but other cryptocurrencies as well, so it's really a matter of building it and providing a menu of options from fiat to the wide range of cryptocurrencies.""  Explosive growth  But Fidelity Charitable is also an early adopter of sorts.  The charity arm of the multinational investment firm first started accepting cryptocurrency through Coinbase's charity service in November 2015, but until this year, it didn't really see the funding mechanism take off. During 2016, its first year full-year of acceptance, crypto donations accounted for only $7 million.  However, throughout the first half of 2017, the firm engaged in a marketing campaign designed to increase the visibility of the service, resulting in 40 articles and a total of $11 million-worth of donations, according to Pirozzolo, who is also the head of Fidelity Charitable's marketing efforts.  ""As that took hold – and we created a web page for people to understand how you can donate this, and started buying paid search behind this, and got more mainstream media coverage and more social coverage – this whole thing really took off,"" she said.  By November, the total donated had doubled to $22 million, momentum that coincided with a tweet that same month from early bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen, who said he had used the platform.  While it's impossible to correlate funding changes directly to the tweet, the following month, Fidelity received an additional $36 million-worth of crypto donations.  Tax incentive  Still, all this isn't to say that more traditional donation types are at risk of being overshadowed by blockchain-based assets anytime soon.  According to a statement from the company, the cryptocurrency asset class falls within the broader category of non-publicly traded assets, which accounted for $1 billion dollars-worth of donations last year. That, in turn, fell within an even broader pool of $4.5 billion-worth of total donations.  The biggest draw to Fidelity Charitable's platform is what's called an investor-managed fund, which lets donors give away assets including cryptocurrency without having to pay capital gains taxes.  The result is that the total amount received by the organization typically increases relative to the donor's tax bracket. And given that a total of 127,000 non-profits received funds from Fidelity last year, this extra money could eventually make an even bigger impact.  Pirozzolo concluded:  ""This is a great win-win for both [donors] as well as the charities.""

According to an official statement dated Feb. 13, the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) revealed it has established a fintech program that will prioritize, among other things, a project dubbed Khokha to explore a proof-of-concept (PoC) using the tech.  The SARB further said in the announcement that it will partner with ConsenSys, the ethereum technology development startup, in developing the PoC. The project will involve replicating the wholesale payment process on Quorum, the enterprise blockchain co-developed by JPMorgan and ethereum startup EthLab.  The SARB states:  ""The aim of this project is to gain a practical understanding of DLTs through the development of a proof of concept (PoC) in collaboration with the banking industry. The objective of the PoC is to replicate interbank clearing and settlement on a DLT which will allow the SARB and industry to jointly assess the potential benefits and risks of DLTs.""  The initiative is the latest effort from South Africa's financial institutions to explore the application of blockchain technology. As reported in February last year, several major banks in South Africa, including the SARB, have already charted a course toward large-scale blockchain implementation.  That said, the SARB stressed that the new effort doesn't mean it is already making the radical move to integrate DLT in the national payment infrastructure. Rather, the PoC is an experiment to understand the impact of using DLT to transact tokenized assets.  Elsewhere in the announcement, the central bank said it will also review a regulatory framework around cryptocurrencies that will primarily focus on issues of anti-money laundering, tax compliance, settlement risks and capital exchange control.

42401099,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLiSK,1518610815,"Blockchain Can Help UK 'Stay Relevant' After Brexit, Says EU Lawmaker","A British Member of the European Parliament (MEP) has called on the City of London and the Bank of England to embrace blockchain technology as a means of staying relevant in the post-Brexit era.  Kay Swinburne, who is also the most senior legislator on the EU's Economic and Monetary Committee, told Business Insider that ""the conservative status quo is now too risky with Brexit,"" and that the U.K. must embrace distributed ledger technology (DLT) to make its markets more efficient.  Swinburne reportedly said:  ""The UK post-Brexit: how does the City of London stay relevant? The City of London stays relevant by suddenly becoming the proponents of the new technologies and not just patching existing systems to make them work post-Brexit, actually leapfrogging.""  The MEP added that she felt that a post-Brexit Britain was better positioned than the EU to benefit from blockchain technology, but only if it is prepared to take risks.  Comparing the blockchain moment with the ""Big Bang"" of the 1980s – an uptick in market activity after the swift deregulation of the markets under Margaret Thatcher – she said, ""We've got proof of concept of DLT in so many areas. It now needs to be scaled up. We've got to take some risks. We have the opportunity to really make a difference in a way that I don't think Europe post-Brexit is going to be able to do.""  The Conservative Party MEP also appealed to the Bank of England to incorporate blockchain into a more modern monetary policy vision, arguing it should be the first central bank to ""open up"" and accept that future monetary policy ""doesn't involve issuing notes all the time, maybe it involves other alternative payment systems.""  The U.K. has demonstrated continued interest in blockchain. Most recently, the government's technology development arm, Innovate UK, announced in January that it plans to invest £19 million ($26.6 million) in projects contributing to ""the fields of emerging and enabling technologies"" including distributed ledger technologies.  Previously, in late 2016, the nation's finance watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, launched a regulatory ""sandbox"" to provide a number blockchain-focused startups a test environment for new financial products.

Ahead of New Year holidays (starting Feb. 15), Chinese and South Koreans often exchange bitcoin for fiat currencies (to fund increased spending), and bitcoin (BTC) tends to drop in the run-up to the event.  Boosting such fears this year is bitcoin's (BTC) recent inability to move above $9,000 in a convincing manner. Since Feb. 10, the cryptocurrency has been restricted to a narrow range of $8,000 to $9,000, shows CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  Still, historical data indicates the probability of bitcoin reporting gains this month is high.  January was a good month for bitcoin during the three year period of 2012–2014, while the performance was mixed in February.  However, since 2015 a clear pattern has been established: BTC drops in January and gains value in February.  The 26 percent decline seen in January this year is the second biggest monthly drop since 2015. Going by the pattern seen in the last three years, the cryptocurrency could see gains this month.  Looking at the technical charts, bitcoin has seen a major bullish reversal pattern today. As of writing, the BPI is seen at around $8,800, and has appreciated by 3.76 percent in the last 24 hours, according to data source CoinMarketCap.  4-hour chart  The above chart (prices as per Bitstamp) shows:  Inverse head and shoulders breakout – a bullish reversal pattern, indicating a bearish-to-bullish trend change.  The previous 4-hour candle closed above the neckline, confirming an upside breakout. As per the measured height method, the breakout has opened the doors for a rally to at least $11,000.  View  Historical data show February has been a good month for bitcoin.  The short-term technical outlook is bullish, with BTC having potential to rise to $11,000.  However, as discussed earlier this week, gains above the $10,000 mark could be transient.  Bearish scenario: Failure to capitalize on the inverse head and shoulders breakout followed by a daily close (as per UTC) below $7,625 (Feb. 2 low) could yield a deeper sell-off to $6,000–$5,900.

According to a company announcement on Feb. 13, soon after Coincheck partially resumed operations on Tuesday, it had already processed 40.1 billion yen (or $373 million) in withdrawal requests from existing investors. The firm first announced the plan to reopen Japanese yen withdrawals on Feb. 9.  The move comes as the Japanese exchange attempts to normalize after it reported a loss of some $500 million-worth of NEM tokens in a major security breach last month.  The significant amount of Japanese yen withdrawn Tuesday may signal decreasing levels of confidence among Coincheck's existing customers following the loss, as well as amid recent scrutiny by Japan's financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA).

The FSA later stated that Coincheck is one of 16 cryptocurrency exchanges in Japan that have yet to obtain a full operation license due to its security vulnerabilities.  Amid the fiat currency withdrawals, Coincheck has yet to disclose a more detailed timeline regarding compensating victims.

The Kantou region office of Japan's Finance Ministry has also published a statement cautioning that the firm failed to register under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act while raising funds, making private offerings and facilitating ICOs in Japan.  According to the FSA statement, the agency had already warned the firm several times prior to making the statement public regarding its allegedly illegal conduct. The firm has yet to respond, it said. As as result, the agency is increasing its efforts to warn domestic investors over the ""possibility of falsehood"" in Blockchain Laboratory's operations.  The news marks the first time that regulators in Japan have issued a warning over a cryptocurrency services company since April last year, when the country legalized bitcoin as a payment method.

42401100,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLiTJ,1518599112,Korean Government Remains Firm on Crypto KYC Mandate,"South Korea has doubled down on its commitment to eliminate the use of cryptocurrency in illicit financial activities, while expressing a will to foster the country's blockchain development.  In a video published Wednesday, Hong Nam-ki, head of the office for policy coordination, said the government is taking a strong stance in bringing transparency to domestic cryptocurrency exchanges.  Hong's statements follow the government's formal response to a petition opposing a severe clampdown on South Korea's cryptocurrency trading platforms. According to the South Korean president's website, the petition has gathered over 280,000 signatures meaning the government was obliged to provide a formal response.  As reported, South Korea's different governing bodies are voicing contradictory comments on regulating cryptocurrency trading in South Korea – with a ban on exchange-based trading even being proposed in some quarters.  Yet, Hong's video today perhaps indicates that instead of banning cryptocurrency trading, the government is focusing more on a strict implementation of anti-money laundering activities for the time being.  ""At the moment, the government places a priority on transparency of virtual currency transactions within the framework of current law. Undesirable things occurred during the check-up process, such as money laundering through an unconfirmed virtual account or, in some cases, depositing customer money in the accounts of employees in the business,"" Hong said in the video.  The comments are also in line with a new regulation imposed on South Korea's cryptocurrency trading platforms ushered in a ban on anonymous trading accounts. Starting from February this year, all exchanges in South Korea have to implement real-name verification for customers before they can resume trading activity.  Previously, the South Korean customs agency also reported that $600 million in unregistered capital exchange involved the use of cryptocurrency as a medium to bypass the country's capital controls.  While the option of banning cryptocurrency exchanges has not been fully ruled out, Hong explained in the video that South Korea's prime minister had recently indicated that prohibiting the use of cryptocurrency exchange is just one of many possibilities, and the government currently is currently not considering the most serious scenario.  Elsewhere in the government response, Hong also stressed that fostering blockchain development will be one of the primary focuses of the government in the coming year. He said the country has increased the government budget associated with blockchain technology for 2018.  Hong concluded:  ""We will do our best to improve technology competitiveness by developing technology for the blockchain or applying to the industry. In particular, as part of this, the government plans to make a 'blockchain industrial development basic plan' during the first half of the year.""

Making the announcement through its official blog post on Feb. 13, Coinbase said the platform currently is unable to offer a smooth credit card purchase experience. As a result, it has ""disabled adding new credit cards as a payment method for U.S. customers.""  The move is a follow-up to the platform's previous confirmation that credit cards issued by four U.S. banks are barred from being used to buy cryptocurrencies. Coinbase said, however, that debit cards remain as a payment option.  ""We know many customers have added credit cards as their primary payment method; we did not make this decision lightly,"" the company said in the post. ""We are actively working with card networks and card issuers to find a long term solution.

In addition, the platform said users who have already linked credit cards to the Coinbase platform can continue using them ""so long as your bank allows them.""

42401083,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLiFX,1518591620,"'Weary Giants of Flesh and Steel,' Meet Bitcoin","Marc Hochstein is the managing editor of CoinDesk.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      ""You have no sovereignty where we gather. We have no elected government, nor are we likely to have one...""  The ""we"" John Perry Barlow referred to in his 1996 essay ""A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace"" was a then-emerging, global community of internet users. But you'd be hard pressed to find a subset of that community who took the ethos to heart more than the pioneers of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. For better or for worse.  Barlow, who died last week at the age of 70, was a towering figure among digital-rights advocates, an early champion of a permissionless internet – something users may take for granted today but was far from a guaranteed outcome in 1990, when he co-founded the Electronic Frontier Foundation.  A longtime lyricist for the Grateful Dead, Barlow envisioned cyberspace as ""a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth ... where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular.""  While Barlow's work focused on freedom of expression and privacy of communications, the principles he stood for arguably animate bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which are designed to be censorship-resistant, anonymous and open to all comers.  For example, anyone with a working internet connection, no matter who or where they are, can download the basic software and use a bitcoin wallet to transfer value to anyone else who has one, no matter who or where they are. No middleman can veto the transaction. Likewise, anyone can contribute code to an open-source project; other members of the community will accept or reject their work according to merit, not status or credentials.  ""In some ways, the best of bitcoin, and blockchain technology in general, adheres to that vision of personal freedom"" that Barlow espoused, said Patrick Murck, a fellow at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard Law School.  Barlow was no Pollyanna, however, and while optimistic overall about digital technologies' potential to improve people's lives, he acknowledged the downsides and cautioned against binary ""good or bad?"" thinking about the subject.  ""You are designing the architecture of liberty and enslavement, both, in these tools that are being derived around the blockchain and other things like it,"" Barlow told a gathering of technologists and entrepreneurs at Stanford University in 2015. ""What you do and the ways in which you do it will have long-lasting effects.""  That was an important message for the community to hear, said Primavera De Filippi, a researcher at the National Center of Scientific Research (CNRS) in Paris and at the Berkman Center. ""You cannot assume that just because a technology dis-intermediates and is trans-national that it cannot potentially be used to reinforce existing social, political and economic structures,"" she said.  The technology is ""going to be used by every stakeholder to promote their own interest,"" added De Filippi, noting that much of the investment in blockchain software has come from financial institutions, the very same actors that bitcoin sought to bypass.  While it's all well and good for corporations to improve transparency and streamline the reconciliation of ledgers, the takeaway from Barlow was that ""unless we go and invest time and effort in building those applications from a civil society perspective, no one else will do it,"" she said.  I had the privilege of attending the Stanford conference, and I'll never forget what Barlow said about the value of online anonymity.  ""I feel the same way about anonymity as I do about guns,"" said the cattle rancher and onetime Republican. ""It may be useful to have in the closet if the government gets out of control.""  Worlds collide  Speaking of governments, bitcoin and its descendants have been testing the limits of the independence Barlow declared for cyberspace.  The core protocols aren't and probably can't be regulated by any state, but the on-ramps, where fiat currency is converted to crypto and back, can and are. Likewise, Bitcoin addresses are pseudonymous, but licensed crypto exchanges require users to identify themselves.  And while initial coin offerings can solicit funds from users across the globe, in the U.S. they are regarded as subject to Depression-era securities laws, as Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Jay Clayton made very clear during a recent Senate hearing.  The common thread is that the ""weary giants of flesh and steel,"" as Barlow memorably described the world's governments, tend to reassert their authority at the borders between cyberspace and meatspace, where the new decentralized networks touch the incumbent centralized ones.  ""If you're constructing a system that really is tethered to the existing institutions of the old world, you're going to be bound by the rules of the old world,"" said Murck. ""That's where we're seeing regulation."" On the other hand, ""no one's saying you can't run a bitcoin node,"" an activity that's endogenous to bitcoin.  Today's web 3.0 projects, such as Filecoin, Blockstack and Sia, seek to create networks that truly would live entirely in the new world, Murck noted, but whether they succeed is yet to be determined.  Quite apart from whether it is feasible to create a self-contained virtual realm where the physical world's ""legal concepts of property, expression, identity, movement, and context do not apply,"" as Barlow put it, some would question whether it's even desirable.  These skeptics will point to the nastier uses of cryptocurrency, such as ransomware or assassination markets – not to mention online abominations in general, like revenge porn and mug-shot blackmail sites – as evidence that without regulation, a freewheeling internet inevitably degenerates into a Hobbesian war of all against all.  But without condoning any of those vile activities, they need to be weighed against the benefits to humanity: of enabling like-minded people to form communities irrespective of geography; of opening access to knowledge for those inclined to learn without making them sit in a classroom six hours a day; of allowing peers on different continents to trade with each other as easily as if they were standing face-to-face in a bazaar.  I suspect the cost-benefit analysis would come out squarely in favor of an open internet – and an open financial system.  So let Barlow's words continue to be an inspiration to the builders of a new digital economy. Be careful, though. Those giants of flesh and steel may be weary, but they have guns.

42401082,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLgZF,1518584453,"How to Send Bitcoin on Lightning (The Early, Risky Way)","It's like the early days of bitcoin all over again.  Comprised of invite-only chat channels, alien terminology and warning signs at every turn, the nascent ecosystem springing up around Lightning Network, the scaling technology that could end up having the greatest impact yet on bitcoin's capacity, is to date, hopelessly difficult to operate.  ""Going to be blunt,"" one developer wrote, ""if you don't know how to compile something, you probably will have a lot more struggles and a lot less coins.""  Simply put, Lightning in its current state is dangerous to interact with today. But given the network's big promises – instant transactions and fees that are next to nothing – risk isn't diminishing the appeal.  Companies like Blockstream are already launching Lightning-powered stores that send stickers to bitcoin users who successfully pass funds across the network, while so-called ""early Lightning adopters"" are being celebrated online for their ""bravery"" on the blockchain.  ""Show the world that you were one the first people to use Lightning on mainnet for a legitimate purchase, if it works,"" Blockstream's website reads.  It's a sentiment that, given the risks, has garnered criticism by some who feel it mistakenly encourages users to risk real money. That said, there are ways to contribute to the early network without putting your own funds at risk.  This includes hanging out in the testing environment (where the majority of Lightning developers are today) or venturing onto the mainnet (where there's a budding set of best practices, even if pitfalls remain).  Below, we offer our guide for early adopters who want to get their hands on the bleeding-edge tech before it's recommended.  Testnet trials  Of the available options, connecting to the testnet isn't exactly intuitive, but it's easier to access than the alternative, with clients that are built to run on most operating systems.  It also has the added benefit of not requiring the use of real bitcoin. Instead, you'll be using test bitcoin, which you can find for free at an online faucet and send to your Lightning wallet.  In total, using the testnet takes about five or so steps to navigate:  To start, there's a number of wallets that you can download, Zap, Lightning Desktop, an Eclair wallet for android, and one option that doesn't require a download at all. If you chose to download a desktop wallet, remember that it will need to sync the bitcoin testnet, which can take several hours.  Having sent the test bitcoin to a wallet address of your choice, you'll need to set up a channel, which is where testing gets slightly unfamiliar. Select a testnet store that you'd like to make a purchase on. There's a variety of these, including a blogging site named yalls, developed by Lightning Lab's Alex Bosworth, a Starbucks-inspired cafe run by Lightning development team ECLAIR and an ice cream parlor.  Next, navigate to the website of your choice and seek out a payment address. Notice that two addresses are given, a payment address and a ""peer address."" (You need to add the store as a peer before you can send it payment.)  Copy the peer address, navigate to your wallet and add the address as a contact. You'll need to send a small fee in order to open this channel, which on the testnet is something like 0.1 test bitcoin.  Once you've successfully opened a channel, you can then paste the payment address in to your wallet along with the desired amount, and send your test bitcoin (instantly).  Using the above process, CoinDesk was able to send a transaction, only running into trouble at times when a majority of test nodes were offline.  Risking it on the mainnet  To restate, this is ill-advised – if you try to send bitcoin, you can lose it.  Not only will this hurt your wallet, but it will upset Lightning's developers, because the more people active on the mainnet the more complicated it becomes to administer updates.  While a bit more complicated (the process described below can take a few days), the seven steps below approximate a rough guide to getting started:  The easiest way to access the mainnet is using Blockstream's c-lightning. Blockstream have published a useful guide that breaks down the various command lines necessary to purchase a sticker in their store, and for a more detailed breakdown of the following steps, visit their website. Other development teams, Lightning Labs and ECLAIR, have yet to publish mainnet clients, however, developers have assured that it is still possible with a little tweaking to the code.  C-lightning requires ubuntu operating system and a variety of code toolkits that will need to be downloaded before you can begin. Lightning also requires you to sync the bitcoin blockchain in its entirety, a process which can take several days, and needs about 170 gigabytes in storage.  Once those steps are out of the way, install the necessary tools, as listed on Blockstream's breakdown.  Next, download bitcoind, a bitcoin full node software that's perhaps the easiest to download – bitcoin.org offers a list of steps in order to do this securely. Remember that it takes a really long time to sync the bitcoin blockchain, so leave it syncing overnight – though depending on your connection it could a number of days.  Once you're happily synced up with the chain, you're then ready to clone the c-lightning code from its GitHub repository. Once that's successfully installed, you can use the command line to connect to Blockstream's peer and sync the channel graph. You'll also need some bitcoin to work with, so use lightning-cli, the internal lightning client, to generate a bitcoin address that you can send some funds to from your normal wallet.  Once you've done this (and confirmed that the payment occurred successfully), you can then open a payment channel with Blockstream's peer. First, use the command line to locate Blockstream's public key to open the channel. Just like on testnet, this will require a small fee, around 500 satoshis.You'll then need to confirm the transaction has gone ahead by monitoring the logs. Wait for three in total to occur before you can open a channel.  Once the three confirmations have passed, you can use lightning-cli to list a new payment channel, which you can then you to make payments to the Blockstream store.  Next steps  If the laundry list of actions above shocks you, that's okay, developers are working on methods to make the network easier to interact with. Remember, Lightning is still in alpha phase, and as development progresses, a wide variety of simplified interfaces are expected to be released.  Easy to use wallets are also likely to be released for mainnet access, so there will be less of a requirement for lightning users to be familiar with the command line. Similarly, other interfaces that make the micropayments easier to integrate by providing a third-party processing service.  Eclair have released an early version of their lightning API. Rather than businesses opening their own channels, Eclair will handle the back-end, process payments and send on-chain bitcoin.  Developers such as Alex Bosworth are also working on ways for users to send Lightning payments without setting up a channel at al, by creating methods for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to interact with the Lightning network.  Ultimately, while the network is now difficult and dangerous for the average user, ongoing development work hints that soon, Lightning could be as simple to use as existing payment interfaces.

The blockchain-powered platform represents a new service area for the exchange, which has been operating since 2003.  Companies will be able to use the platform to issue traditional equity and debt through tokenized securities, which would then be offered to investors through fully regulated offerings, which stand in contrast to initial coin offerings (ICOs) that more often than not operate in a regulatory gray area.  ""Our platform represents an intersection between blockchain and the capital markets that delivers on blockchain's promise to disrupt conventional transaction and record-keeping mechanisms, thereby providing tangible benefits for market stakeholders,"" Richard Carleton, chief executive officer of the CSE, said in a statement.  ""By harnessing this technology, the potential exists to extend corporate finance beyond the limits of traditional equity and debt offerings,"" Carleton added.  The CSE has licensed the platform's technology from Fundamental Interactions Inc., a New York-based firm that designs ""multi-asset trading appliance products.""  In the meantime, the exchange operator has also signed a ""memorandum of understanding"" with Kabuni, a 3-D printing company in British Columbia that plans to file with the British Columbia Securities Commission (BCSC) to issue tokens to investors via a security token offering.
