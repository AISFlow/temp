Funds will be used in accelerating development and community growth. Fasttoken (FTN) is the utility token in Fastex’s expansive Web 3 ecosystem. Up-and-coming Web 3 ecosystem, Fastex, announces a successful capital raise of $23.2 million, following the recent completion of its private and public sale of its Fasttoken (FTN). The additional funding was raised in a token generation (TGE) over the past few months, with two phases of private investments running from December to mid-January and the public sale that launched on January 18 and sold out in less than 72 hours. According to the official statement, the funding will be used in developing new features, accelerating the innovation of its Web 3 ecosystem, and global marketing to boost its GameFi and Web3 ecosystems. Vigen Badalyan, the co-founder of SoftConstruct, the incubator of Fastex, believes the latest round of funding will “bring the benefits of web3 to game players and gaming partners [on Fastex]” as it heads towards its next growth phase. “We’re excited for the next phase of growth for Fasttoken and the Fastex ecosystem,” Badalyan said. “Our goal has always been to bring the benefits of web3 to game players and our gaming partners and we’re laser-focused to make that happen.” The FTN is the official utility token of Fastex and helps power its comprehensive crypto ecosystem including ftNFT (Fastex’s NFT marketplace), Fastex Pay for crypto payments, FastexVerse, a gaming metaverse, and the Fastex exchange. So far, over 100 gaming platforms and developers have collaborated with Fastex to incorporate the FTN token in powering their GameFi projects, the statement further confirmed. “We are also immensely grateful to the more than 100 gaming partners who have chosen to adopt Fasttoken as their in-game token,” Vigen Badalyan said. Many developers choose FTN as it is built on a scalable and secure Fastex chain, a Proof of Staked Activity blockchain solution, which uses staking and user activity to secure the chain. As a utility token, FTN provides game developers with a highly scalable and low transaction fee token to power their Web3 games and run in-game marketplaces. The token also provides an onramp for gamers and crypto aficionados who find it hard to join the world of Web 3 gaming. Fastex aims at building a comprehensive Web 3 ecosystem, in response to the fragmented and complicated onboarding process currently hampering the adoption of Web 3 services and products, specifically Web 3 gaming. The platform is introducing new concepts of diversification by building an impressive ecosystem of services, not limited to gaming or trading. FTN will support other DeFi utilities such as staking, block creation, validation mechanisms and rewards to build out a fully comprehensive Web3 ecosystem for its gamers. In addition, unified wallet accounts will allow users to submit KYC details only once to access the full spectrum of on-chain applications. Finally, FTN will be the umbrella token for all the web3 products and services within the Fastex ecosystem, including its B2C and P2P payment solutions.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | ICO | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/all/fasttoken-ftn-secures-multi-million-dollar-investment-to-advance-its-web-3-ecosystem/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

8386485,https://newsbtc.com/?p=517876,1674910815,U.S. Government Releases Roadmap To Mitigate Crypto Risk For Investors,"The U.S. government is set to tighten regulations to mitigate the growing risks associated with the crypto industry. This development comes after increased scrutiny following the collapse of FTX and Terra Luna in 2022. In a press release on January 27, the White House put forward a comprehensive roadmap designed to protect investors and hold bad actors accountable. The roadmap highlighted several measures for more effective regulations in the crypto industry. A Two-Pronged Approach By U.S. Government The U.S. government revealed that it had spent the past two years identifying the risks of cryptocurrency and finding ways to mitigate them. To ensure these measures are implemented, the White House intends to utilize a two-pronged approach. Firstly, the U.S. government has developed a framework for individuals and organizations to safely and responsibly develop digital assets. This includes addressing the risks they pose as well as highlighting poor practices within the crypto industry. Secondly, agencies have been mandated to increase enforcement and develop new regulations where needed. While there’s an increase in public awareness programs designed to help consumers understand the risks of buying cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: US Federal Regulators Warn About Crypto Activities The White House also pointed out that Congress had a major role in expanding regulators’ powers and passing transparency laws for cryptocurrency companies. It also warned about passing legislation that would reverse the current gains and tie cryptocurrency with the U.S. financial system. In addition, the government intends to commit significant resources toward digital assets research and development, and this would help technologies power digital currencies and protect investors by default. Crypto Industry Still Reeling From FTX Collapse The crypto industry is still recovering from the bearish markets resulting from several CeFi platforms’ high-profile collapses. 3AC, Voyager, BlockFi, and FTX were among the top platforms to file for bankruptcy, with the quartet holding more than $100 billion in assets. The nature of FTX collapse brought about increased scrutiny of the crypto industry. Congress testimonials exposed the risk-averse nature of crypto companies’ executives as details emerged that Sam Bankman-Fried misused clients’ funds through his trading firm Alameda Research. The ripple effect was massive as several individuals and firms exposed to the platform suffered huge losses, with some companies forced to shut down. These events caused concerns and reactions from within and outside the crypto space. It is, therefore, unsurprising that the U.S. government is looking to tighten its grip on regulations.

42413016,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7LOE,1674901704,Sam Bankman-Fried Seeks Right to Transfer FTX's Crypto,"Lawyers for Sam Bankman-Fried have argued he should be allowed access to assets and crypto held by his former company, FTX, saying there's no evidence he's responsible for previous alleged unauthorized transactions.  Bankman-Fried, who resigned as FTX's chief executive officer on Nov. 11, 2022, when the crypto exchange filed for bankruptcy protection, is currently on bail facing charges including wire fraud and money laundering, to which he has pleaded not guilty.  As part of his bail conditions, Bankman-Fried was prohibited from accessing cryptocurrency held by FTX and its trading arm, Alameda Research, after the government pointed to illicit transfers made from Alameda wallets. The bar includes crypto purchased with FTX or Alameda funds.  “Nearly three weeks have passed since the initial pretrial conference and we assume that the Government’s investigation has confirmed what Mr. Bankman-Fried has said all along; namely, that he did not access and transfer these assets,” said a Jan. 28 letter from Bankman-Fried’s lawyer, Mark Cohen.  “Given that the sole basis advanced for seeking that condition has not been supported, we believe that the bail condition imposed at the conference should be removed,” Cohen told Lewis Kaplan, a judge in the federal court in the Southern District of New York.  In a Jan. 27 filing, the U.S. Department of Justice requested a communications ban as an additional bail condition, saying that Bankman-Fried had attempted to contact FTX General Counsel Ryne Miller, a potential witness in the case.  Cohen’s response broadly agrees to the restriction, but says Bankman-Fried should still have access to some former staffers, including his therapist George Lerner.  “Requiring Mr. Bankman-Fried to include counsel in every communication with a former or current FTX employee would place an unnecessary strain on his resources and prejudice his ability to defend this case,” Cohen said. “Many of these individuals are Mr. Bankman-Fried’s friends. Imposing a blanket restriction on his contact with them would remove an important source of personal support.”  Bankman-Fried attempted to “offer his assistance” in messages sent to Miller and new FTX CEO John Ray, which apparently went ignored by the intended recipients, Cohen said.

8379547,https://newsbtc.com/?p=517850,1674900649,Former FTX Boss Sam Bankman-Fried Using Privacy Messaging App Signal,"Federal prosecutors of the Southern District of New York overseeing the current case against Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced founder and former CEO of FTX, want the court to impose tighter bail conditions on the defendant. SBF Using Signal Based on their investigations, they discovered that Sam Bankman-Fried, also known as SBF, had messaged the general counsel of FTX US via Signal. Signal is a messaging app similar to WhatsApp. The platform offers instant messaging across platforms, allowing people to communicate privately. Signal creators’ primary focus is on security and privacy. The application is run as a non-profit managed by a foundation. Over 40 million people use it, and per court filings, SBF is one of them. Investigators said messages sent to the general counsel of FTX US, an individual who can be a potential witness in the ongoing criminal case against SBF, were “suggestive of an effort to influence a witness’ potential testimony.” On January 15, SBF, prosecutors say, messaged the general counsel asking if they could “reconnect” and “if there’s a way for (for them) to have a constructive relationship, use each other as resources.” Related Reading: Scaramucci: FTX Cannot Be Saved, Sam Betrayed Me Investigators claim these messages are concerning because, considering the nature of the current investigation, the general counsel might have access to information that might help indict the defendant. For his action, federal prosecutors are asking the overseeing judge to prevent SBF from communicating with former employees and to stop using Signal. His continued communication would be contrary to the bail terms. Even in his house arrest, the former CEO continues to receive visitors. For instance, there are reports that author Michael Lewis visited SBF. He is writing a book about the crypto entrepreneur. The Collapse Of FTX SBF managed FTX, an exchange that was at one point one of the most liquid in the world, only after Binance and Coinbase, since launch. However, it later emerged that through Alameda Research, SBF was misusing user funds to recklessly trade, invest in crypto projects, and donate to U.S. political parties. Falling crypto prices also accelerated the collapse. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Outflows Reach Highest Value Since FTX Crash, Bullish? Following the collapse of FTX and the revelation of the extent of SBF’s misappropriation, U.S. authorities are charging the 30-year-old with, among others, money laundering, fraud, and campaign finance violation. SBF is out on a $250 million bond and has pleaded not guilty to all the charges against him. Apart from the various interviews he did earlier before his arrest, it has emerged that the former CEO has begun mounting a defense of his own. Recently, it was revealed that he had been laying out his turn of events leading to the collapse of FTX on Substack, a media platform.

8375430,https://newsbtc.com/?p=517834,1674893932,Crypto-Friendly Bank Silvergate Suspends Dividend Payouts,"Silvergate, a California-based crypto bank whose shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, is suspending dividend payout to remain highly liquid as the digital currency market tries to pull itself out of the liquidity crisis of 2022. In a press release on January 27, Silvergate, a state-chartered bank that went public in 2019, said it would suspend dividend payout on its “5.375% Fixed Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A” to preserve capital. Focus On Liquidity The crypto bank said its primary focus is maintaining a highly liquid balance sheet with a strong capital position. This will give it an advantage as it navigates the high volatility in crypto. The move means the crypto bank will have more capital than customers’ digital assets. The bank’s board of directors will re-evaluate the payments of quarterly dividends depending on market conditions evolve. There was no official comment from any of Silvergate’s executives. Related Reading: NYDIG Analyzed The FTX Collapse And Its Implications. What Did We Learn? The high volatility in crypto saw prices peak at around $70,000 in November 2021 before plunging to $15,300 in November 2022. Losses were due to several macroeconomic factors and crypto-related events. The shift in monetary policy saw central banks hike interest rates to tame runaway inflation. In return, this change saw capital flow in the other direction, away from what investors would ordinarily label as “risky”, including crypto and stocks, to safe havens like bonds and gold. Silvergate Forced To Take Bold Steps The collapse of several CeFi platforms, first 3AC, Voyager, and BlockFi, before FTX said it was halting withdrawals and eventually filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, broke the markets. In the aftermath, crypto assets capitulated, with Bitcoin sinking to 2022 lows. At one time, FTX was valued at over $32 billion. It later emerged that Sam Bankman-Fried misappropriated clients’ funds through the exchange’s related trading firm, Alameda Research. The risk to safety from investors spilled over to Silvergate, stretching the crypto bank. On January 17, Silvergate posted its financial statements with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), saying they posted a loss of $949 million in 2022. This was a sharp reversal in fortunes considering the bank made $75.5 million in profits in 2021. Related Reading: US Federal Regulators Warn About Crypto Activities Early this month, Silvergate clients withdrew almost $8 billion of their crypto deposits. Reports indicate that roughly 66% of the bank’s clients pulled out their coins in the last three months of the year. Subsequently, the bank was forced to sell $5.2 billion of its assets to cover costs and remain liquid amid the industry’s rapid changes.

42413039,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7MxW,1674873697,"DOJ Claims Sam Bankman-Fried Tried to Influence Witness Testimony, Asks for Communications Ban","Federal prosecutors wrote a letter to U.S. District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan on Friday, requesting that he modify the conditions of Sam Bankman-Fried’s bail to include a ban on private communications with current and former employees of FTX and Alameda Research.  The Department of Justice’s (DOJ) request comes after Bankman-Fried reached out to at least one FTX employee – identified as Ryne Miller, the current general counsel for FTX US – to allegedly attempt to influence his future witness testimony.  “I would really love to reconnect and see if there’s a way for us to have a constructive relationship, use each other as resources when possible, or at least vet things with each other,” the DOJ’s letter quotes Bankman-Fried as saying to Miller.  Prosecutors also requested that Judge Kaplan prevent Bankman-Fried from using “any encrypted or ephemeral call or messaging application, including but not limited to Signal.”  In their letter to the court, prosecutors said Bankman-Fried used the Signal app to reach out to Miller, as well as other current and former FTX employees – which prosecutors described as “the very people who until recently were the defendant’s underlings whom he supervised and financially compensated, and who are therefore most vulnerable to intimidation” – asking to talk.  Prosecutors said Bankman-Fried’s message was a thinly veiled attempt to “influence [Miller’s] potential testimony,” which they described as “particularly concerning” given Miller’s first-hand knowledge of Bankman-Fried’s conduct around the time of FTX’s collapse.  “[Miller] participated in Signal and Slack communications with the defendant and a small group of company insiders during the relevant events of November 2022,” prosecutors said. “In those messages, among other things, [Bankman-Fried] gave instructions for liquidating Alameda’s investments to satisfy FTX customer withdrawals, and indicated that he transferred approximately $45 million of Alameda's funds to FTX US to fill an apparent hole in FTX US’ balance sheet.”  The prosecutors’ claim, if true, would refute Bankman-Fried’s continued declarations on social media and elsewhere that FTX US was solvent at the time the rest of his empire collapsed.  Prosecutors also told Judge Kaplan that testimony from former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison revealed that Bankman-Fried purposely used auto-deleting Slack and Signal messages for work communications because he knew that “many legal cases turn on documentation and it is more difficult to build a legal case if information is not written down or preserved.”  “In fact, the autodeletion of FTX and Alameda’s Slack and Signal communications has impeded the Government’s investigation; potential witnesses have described relevant and incriminating conversations with the defendant that took place on Slack and Signal that have already been autodeleted because of settings implemented at the defendant’s direction,” prosecutors said.",NEGATIVE,없음,REGULATION | RESEARCH,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/01/28/doj-claims-sam-bankman-fried-tried-to-influence-witness-testimony-asks-for-communication-ban,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ff0b567ae379e6463591d3b1d16f6ac053c9f331-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""Smart investors quietly used the recent U.S. inflation print as a confirmation signal to buy Bitcoin - and other cryptos,"" said Markus Thielen, head of research, Matrixport. He also noted that most of the gains this month were driven by institutional investors in the U.S. A Mizuho survey found that retail investors likely shied away from crypto despite bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) rally this month. Investors now await the Federal Reserve's policy meet next week, in which a 25 bp rate hike is widely expected. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) could be pressured if the Fed sticks to its hawkish views.

Regulatory Scanner The Federal Reserve denied Custodia Bank's application to access its payment system as its risk management framework was ""insufficient"" to address concerns over illegal activities. The SEC is said to be intensifying scrutiny of registered investment advisors who directly or indirectly have custody of client crypto assets. Senior White House officials called on Congress to expand regulators' powers to prevent crypto misuse and mitigate conflicts of interest.

8353723,https://newsbtc.com/?p=517821,1674864048,Does the Crypto Market Have The Strength To Break To The Upside? QCP Capital Weighs In,"The conditions of the cryptocurrency market have changed drastically; according to an analysis by QCP Capital, the options market in its current state makes the crypto industry look like a major crisis, such as the shutdown of crypto exchange FTX after filing for bankruptcy, never happened. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Outflows Reach Highest Value Since FTX Crash, Bullish? Trading desk QCP Capital published observations on the crypto industry, revealing some key points to consider for the coming months. The Crypto Market Comes Back To Life QCP’s analysis points out that Bitcoin (BTC) risk reversals have been trading in positive territory over the past week, which tells us that calls (buys) have been more expensive than puts (sells) since 2021 across multiple tenors. This is unusual for the sector as BTC typically has a persistent put skew, mainly due to miner/treasury hedging activity. The chart below depicts this market behavior and the bullish sentiment impacting the options sector. Put skew drives the price of puts higher and calls lower. This difference in pricing between options is called skew and, under normal circumstances, puts trade with higher volatility than calls precisely because investors are hedging some of their bullish positions. For the trading desk, this means that the sentiment in the cryptocurrency market has shifted from bearish to bullish, a culmination of what has been happening in the macro market and the slight recovery in the economy. Bulls Might Get Their Hearts Broken On Valentines Day Ethereum’s (ETH) implied volatility (IV), which represents the expected volatility of a stock or currency over the option’s life, has fallen, indicating complacency as the market prices out fears of a price collapse, according to the analysis. The enthusiasm in the market can be measured by the amount of “fear of missing out” (FOMO) that has set in, with many chasing prices and the top by buying high delta calls and going long in the spot market over the past week. With the upcoming “Big Bad” Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, the trading desk expects the market to be more cautious and conservative. According to QCP, the following potentially problematic date will be February 14th, when the following CPI report will occur, which can potentially “break the heart of the bulls.” For QCP, this is the same scenario the market experienced in December. Similarly, the price may experience a topside breakout characterized by a highly sharp and violent movement. Bitcoin is currently trading at $23,200 and seems to be paving the way for the conquest of new levels. It has gained 0.7% in the last 24 hours and 10.3% in the last seven days. Bitcoin is trying to break the next obstacle represented by the $24,400 level. Ethereum is trading at $1600, up 0.3% in the last 24 hours, with sideways price action. The next resistance wall is at $1,691, a zone the bulls have not visited since September 2022. Ethereum has gained 3.8% in the last seven days.
