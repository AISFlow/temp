27812751,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=607931,1715727625,"Dogecoin Derivatives Volume Jumps 111% As Open Interest Spikes, But What About Price?","A number of Dogecoin metrics have turned bullish in the last few days, showing increased interest from investors. This ranges from the meme coin’s daily derivatives trading volumes to its open interest seeing a significant increase. However, in the midst of this, the Dogecoin price has remained limp, sparking worries among investors. Dogecoin Derivatives Volume And Open Interest See Increase One of the major Dogecoin metrics that has seen a significant increase recently is its derivatives trading volume. The trend began on Monday when the derivatives trading volume saw a 60% uptick. However, it seems DOGE traders are far from done as the volume has almost doubled since that time. Related Reading: Analyst Points Out Level To Beat If Bitcoin Is To Reach $76,000 According to data from Coinglass, the Dogecoin derivatives trading volume is up 111% in the last day alone. This has pushed the derivatives trading volume to $3.85 billion, a significant increase from the $1.99 billion that was recorded on Monday. The launch of Dogecoin futures contracts by Coinbase, the leading crypto exchange in the United States, may have something to do with this. Following the launch on April 1, 2024, the meme coin has seen increased interest in its derivatives products, which explains the increase in the volume. However, the derivatives trading volume is not the only thing that has seen an uptick during this time. As Coinglass data shows, the Dogecoin open interest has also risen significantly during this time. It has seen an approximately 12% increase in the last day to touch above $830 million. Despite this increase in the Dogecoin open interest, it is still a long way from its all-time high of $1.91 billion that was recorded on March 29. So, the current open interest of $830 million represents an over 50% decline from its all-time high. At the same time, the DOGE price is still struggling, showing a disconnect between the rise in metrics and the price of the meme coin. DOGE Price Doesn’t Respond To Bullish Metrics The Dogecoin price has remained muted during this time, even with the increased momentum. The total daily trading volume of the meme coin is up 128% in the last day. However, its price has barely moved 4%, even amid the meme coin craze sparked by the GameStop (GME) 100% rally. Related Reading: Analyst Who Predicted Solana’s 1,100% Move Reveals Where The Altcoin Is Headed Next DOGEs price has barely moved during this time and the resistance at $0.15 is waxing stronger. This suggests that the focus is no longer on Dogecoin during meme coin craze and rather on newer counterparts such as Solana-based GME and AMC, which have seen incredible rallies in the last day. At the time of writing, the DOGE price is trending at $0.49, with a 3.48% increase in the last day. However, in the longer time frame, the meme coin is struggling with 5.79% and 4% losses on the weekly and monthly charts, respectively.

Salim Ramji left BlackRock in January to “seek a new leadership or entrepreneurial opportunity outside the firm,” he said then. The move came shortly after the asset manager launched the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which Ramji oversaw the filing and logistics for, according to Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.  ""He has been quoted about his interest in digital assets although I'm not sure that's going to change Vanguard's stance but he will be the CEO. Who knows. Door much more open now IMO,"" Balchunas wrote in a post on X.  The Wall Street Journal first reported the appointment earlier on Tuesday, with the company confirming his appointment in a press release later in the evening.  In a statement, Ramji said he would be working with Vanguard's leadership to ""lead the company into the future.""  ""The current investor landscape is changing, and that presents opportunities for Vanguard to further its mission of giving people the best chance for investment success, which is more relevant today than at any time in the firm's five-decade history,"" he said. ""My focus will be to mobilize Vanguard to meet the moment while staying true to that core purpose – remaining the trusted firm that takes a stand for all investors.""  Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store said: “Will be interesting to see if Salim Ramji tries to help Vanguard investors gain access to crypto as he believed in doing for BlackRock investors.""  The pick comes as a surprise given Vanguard’s negative stance on bitcoin and Ramji’s known interest in the industry, sparking chatter on social media that the asset manager might change its stance.  “The underlying technology that underpins bitcoin and the blockchain technology, something that we’re incredibly excited about, and we’re excited about it because it removes frictions or at least has the promise of removing frictions across the ecosystem,” Ramji said in an interview on Bloomberg TV in July 2023. “The underpinnings are really powerful for us and that really sparked our interest.”  If confirmed, this will also mark the first time that Vanguard is hiring a CEO from outside the company.

42418243,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcxx7,1715725921,"Lido Co-Founders, Paradigm Secretly Back EigenLayer Competitor as DeFi Battle Lines Form","The co-founders of dominant liquid staking protocol Lido, along with the venture capital firm Paradigm, are secretly helping to fund a new company, Symbiotic, that would compete in the fast-growing arena of ""restaking,"" according to people briefed on the matter.  Internal company documents obtained by CoinDesk lay out diagrams of how the project would work.  The emergence of a restaking player with deep-pocketed backers could portend a face-off that might redefine the DeFi landscape.  The co-founders of Lido, the biggest liquid staking protocol on Ethereum, are secretly funding a competitor to EigenLayer, the buzzy ""restaking"" service that has emerged rapidly this year to become a powerful force in decentralized finance.  According to several people with knowledge of the matter, the project is called Symbiotic and has drawn backing from not only the Lido co-founders, Konstantin Lomashuk and Vasiliy Shapovalov, through their venture firm Cyber Fund, but also Paradigm, the crypto venture capital firm that is one of Lido's lead investors.  CoinDesk also obtained internal Symbiotic documents that describe the project, which allows users to ""restake"" using Lido's staked ether (stETH) token in addition to other popular assets that are not natively compatible with EigenLayer.  Developed by the team that previously built a security service called Statemind, Symbiotic will be ""a permissionless restaking protocol that provides flexible mechanisms for decentralized networks to coordinate node operators and providers of economic security,"" according to the internal company documents reviewed by CoinDesk.  The documents were marked as ""preliminary"" and ""not for distribution,"" but several teams working in the nascent restaking ecosystem – including actively validated services (AVSs) and liquid restaking services building on EigenLayer – say they have already been in discussions to integrate with the protocol.  Representatives of Paradigm, Symbiotic and Cyber Fund declined to comment on the deal.  New kid in town  Lido was the breakout sensation in DeFi just a couple of years ago when it developed a protocol that allowed users to stake cryptocurrency on Ethereum – essentially locking it in – but still get a token ""stETH"" that they could use to trade in the meantime. The project proved so popular that it now ranks as the largest decentralized finance protocol on Ethereum, with $27 billion worth of deposits, attaining such a dominant position that some players worried about the operational risks of its outsize influence.  But lately, Lido has been grappling with a falling market share as users shifted assets over to EigenLayer, a newer service that allows users to restake Ethereum's native ETH token to help secure other networks.  EigenLayer is one of the biggest crypto success stories in recent memory, drawing in some $16 billion worth of deposits since it opened up to investors last year.  Similar to EigenLayer, Symbiotic will offer a way for decentralized applications, called actively validated services, or ""AVSs,"" to collectively secure one another. Users will be able to restake assets that they've deposited with other crypto protocols to help secure these AVSs – be they rollups, interoperability infrastructure, or oracles – in exchange for rewards.  The key difference between Symbiotic and EigenLayer is that users will be able to directly deposit any asset based on Ethereum's ERC-20 token standard into Symbiotic – meaning the protocol will be directly compatible with Lido's staked ETH (stETH) token, as well as thousands of other assets that use the ubiquitous ERC-20 standard. EigenLayer, meanwhile, only accepts ETH tokens.  In what might be a twist of irony, when crypto venture giant Paradigm approached Sreeram Kannan, co-founder of EigenLayer, to invest in his project, he turned their money down in favor of rival venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, according to several people briefed on the matter. Paradigm told Kannan that they would invest in a competitor to his project instead.  Kannan didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.  Uber, Lyft and a potentially huge market  The emergence of a potentially formidable EigenLayer competitor underscores how companies and investors have become eager to capitalize on restaking as the trend has taken over the industry conversation. Blockworks reported in April that Karak, another restaking upstart, had secured funding from the major U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase, among others.  ""The space is big enough for more than one player to be big,"" said one restaking infrastructure operator who plans to integrate with Symbiotic but spoke on the condition of anonymity since the project remains in stealth. ""Uber and Lyft, I think, are perfect examples. It's the same thing here. Restaking is going to be massive.""  The involvement of Cyber Fund, led by Lido's co-founders, and Paradigm, its main venture backer, could put Symbiotic in a strong position to challenge EigenLayer. It's also further evidence that people close to Lido perceive EigenLayer's approach to restaking as a potential threat to its own dominance.  Although Lido remains the largest decentralized finance protocol on Ethereum by a wide margin, the project's strategy around restaking will play a major role in whether (and how) it manages to maintain its lead in the general staking realm.  Liquid restaking startups that deposit user funds into EigenLayer have eaten into the market for Lido's stETH token. The two largest liquid restaking protocols, Ether.Fi and Renzo saw $625 million in net inflows over the past 30 days. Lido, meanwhile, saw $75 million in net outflows over that same period.  Read more: What Are Restaking, Liquid Restaking and EigenLayer?  This week, members of Lido DAO (decentralized autonomous organization), the governance body that controls the Lido protocol, publicly proposed the ""Lido Alliance,"" a guiding framework for thinking about restaking that would place stETH squarely at the trend's center.  ""Lido DAO will identify and recognize projects that share the same values and mission and have a way to positively contribute to the stETH ecosystem,"" the proposal stated. ""Growing an Ethereum-aligned ecosystem around stETH helps decentralize the network.”  While Lido is not directly tied to Symbiotic, the restaking startup funded by Lido's co-founders lines up well with the Lido Alliance framework.  Whereas EigenLayer only accepts deposits of ether (ETH) tokens and certain ETH derivatives (including Lido's stETH), Symbiotic will not accept ETH deposits at all. Instead, it will allow users to directly deposit any ERC-20 token, including Lido's staked ETH (stETH) and other tokens that use the popular token standard.  ""Collateral in Symbiotic can encompass ERC-20 tokens, withdrawal credentials of Ethereum validators, or other onchain assets such as LP positions, without limitations regarding which blockchains the positions are held on,"" the project said in its its documents.  Discussions with restaking firms  Symbiotic's approach to collateral ties into its broader ambition to become a ""permissionless"" protocol, meaning apps that build on the platform should have substantial leeway over how they augment it to serve their use case.  ""I’m excited about what they’re working on. It seems interesting and innovative,"" Mike Silgadze, co-founder of Ether.Fi, one of the largest restaking protocols, said in a Telegram message. ""It seems like they’re very focused on building something fully permissionless and decentralized.""  Renzo, another large liquid restaking service, is already in discussions to integrate with Symbiotic after it launches, according to a source close to both teams.  Symbiotic has not released any information publicly and would not confirm when it plans to launch, but four sources consulted for this article said they expect the platform to be released in some form by the end of this year.  Margaux Nijkerk contributed reporting.  CORRECTION (May 15, 17:11 UTC): Clarifies that EigenLayer accepts deposits of some ETH derivatives, in addition to pure ETH.

Stagnant Crypto Market Per the report, Novogratz described the current phase in the crypto market as a consolidation period. He emphasized that Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), and other cryptocurrencies, including Solana (SOL), are expected to consolidate. This consolidation phase suggests that the Bitcoin price will likely trade within a range of approximately $55,000 to $75,000 until significant market events drive prices higher. Related Reading: On A Tear: Toncoin Outshines Bitcoin With Price Surge And Social Buzz The crypto market has experienced a period of stagnation following the historic bull run witnessed in the past two quarters. This surge was fueled by the launch of spot US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the Bitcoin Halving, which reduced the supply of new BTC. However, Bitcoin’s price trend reversed due to diminishing optimism surrounding interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed), amid consistently strong economic indicators. According to Novogratz’s analysis, if his predictions hold, Solana could continue to consolidate within its current trading range of $120 to $150. This consolidation has been observed over the past month, indicating a period of stability for the cryptocurrency. Similarly, Ethereum’s price has closely mirrored Bitcoin’s movements and has traded between the $2,870 and $3,200 levels. Ethereum recently failed to consolidate above the significant $4,000 mark reached in mid-March. As a result, Ethereum has experienced a period of price consolidation within the range above. Bitcoin Volatility Persists Novogratz acknowledged the tailwinds that propelled the market during the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024. Galaxy’s CEO believes that these tailwinds will likely persist throughout the current quarter and possibly the next unless there are significant developments, such as the Fed initiating rate cuts due to an economic slowdown or until the regulatory landscape becomes clearer after the upcoming election. Moreover, Novogratz noted a significant shift in counterparties’ willingness to lend crypto for extended periods without collateral, a trend that was not prevalent just six months ago. He emphasized that engagement in the crypto space has reached a new level, with growing interest from individuals and institutions alike.

42418234,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcxll,1715722896,Irthu Suresh: Using Blockchain Tech to Reduce Water Shortages,"Much of the world takes water for granted. And much of the world has so little water that it’s a matter of life and death.  So how can we send water from areas of surplus to areas of need? This is the mission of Atlantis, a project devoted to solving issues stemming from climate change, focusing primarily on water. And they’re trying to crack this problem by using blockchain.  Irthu Suresh is a speaker at this year’s Consensus festival in Austin, Texas, May 29-31.  Atlantis is not just theoretical. Across 50 villages in the region of Chikmagalur, India, Atlantis deployed a Web3 solution that incentivized people to effectively transfer water from the Haves to the Have Nots. A clever system of “bounties” encouraged villagers to perform tasks that enabled this new distribution. And the pilot program worked. “We’ve exchanged more than 21,000 kiloliters of water,” says Irthu Suresh, CEO of Atlantis.  Giving a sneak preview of what he’ll share in Austin at Consensus, Suresh explains why Atlantis adopted blockchain, the challenges they had to overcome for onboarding, and why he wants the world to know that Web3 is not just for trading but that “we can use this to fight water problems, to fight poverty.”  Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  Atlantis didn’t start out as a blockchain organization, but eventually you incorporated the tech. What led you to this?  Irthu Suresh: We were trying to build solutions for climate change — primarily through water — as a Web2 company, but a private entity trying to build for the commons was not really striking a chord. And we ran into all kinds of challenges with existing power structures, everything from regulations to unregulated mafia in India. It’s very easy to bring down an idea if it’s built by a private entity. All you need is a bunch of lawyers.  And that led us to think, “How can me and my co-founder become insignificant over time as this system scales?"" And that led us to look at decentralized distributed systems. We figured that if this works, no one should be able to bring it down.  Then we realized that there were people who were willing to harvest additional water and then supply it into the network. This was creating additional pools of surplus resources. And we were like, “What if we could build this entire system on blockchain?”  So what does that look like exactly?  In most parts of the world, things like water are heavily regulated. And you have these centralized grids. But as cities and spaces expand, often these centralized grids struggle to catch up.  But India is a great example of being built, historically, on decentralized communities. You have small pockets of villages taking care of their needs. It's hyper-local. So for us, it was a no-brainer to bring some kind of concept that solves for resource allocation problems.  There are some parts where water is abundant, and nobody cares about it. And there are other places where access to water is life and death. So for the pilot, when we partnered with Mercy Corps Ventures, we chose a specific location in India where on one side of this hill there’s an abundance of water, and on the other side of the hill there’s a drought. And how could people in this region exchange this excess water? How could we create the infrastructure locally itself? So for our pilot program in Chikmagalur — a rural region with 50 villages — we started with people in different water stress zone.  Interesting. What did your system do?  First we had people locally volunteer to spread awareness, then we had local people sign up to become water harvesters. Once we had these harvesters and there was a rain that was captured, there was an opportunity for it to be exchanged.  How does blockchain fit into this?  We built the product on a mobile native app. On this app, everybody could create a profile, sign up, and first mention what their skill is. And based on the skill, we start giving you tasks. And these tasks are pretty much to build up this peer-to-peer water network.  You could take part in surveying, you could take part in water sample testing, you could sign up as someone who wants to spread awareness through workshops, or you could become a harvester. All of these tasks are gamified; we call them bounties. People sign up and then they do the required steps that are required, and then they get incentivized. We knew this first required a distributed ledger that is tamper-proof, and we knew that blockchain is useful for that.  Amazing. Can you quantify the impact so far?  Yeah. We’ve exchanged more than 21,000 kiloliters of water. The network has over 3,000 people and it's covering 50 villages. Out of the 3,000, predominantly most are consumers who are coming into the network to access water. But we have almost 150 harvesters in the network. And then we have a bunch of surveyors and validators.  What’s a validator in this context?  Let’s say you plug into the network and say, ""Hey, I'm a harvester."" Then we put out a bounty for someone in the locality to become a validator, who goes to your place and just validates that, ""Hey, these guys have the infrastructure for it."" So what happens, in essence, is we’re creating a bunch of these local green jobs. And all of these different tasks are gamified using our bounty system.  What problems did you run into?  One was off-ramping. Especially in India, it's tough to off-ramp, because the regulations are still in a gray area.  And then starting from the first MVP we designed, at the very onset of onboarding, whenever we asked people to connect to a wallet, that didn't work. Because people were like, ""What's a wallet?"" And I got an absolute schooling on UI and UX. We had to really figure out when is the right place to introduce blockchain or the Web3 terminologies.  And we had to take extra steps to educate people about it. Because people are like, ”Oh, it's crypto. That means it's a scam.” And we’re like, “No, no, hold on!” Right? Like, there's so much more to it!  What tokens are you using to drive the mechanics?  We do have an internal token, which we'll someday launch. During the pilot we actively used it. But seeing how the Web3 market works, we are strong believers that unless we hit a strong product-market fit, launching a token doesn't make sense for us.  So we’ve integrated a mechanism in which different tokens can be brought into the platform. If someone wants to fund a water project in Africa using Solana they can, whereas if somebody wants to do a water project in Vietnam using Optimism, they're able to do that. We really worked on the interoperability aspect of it because climate change does not care which chain you are on.  Well said. Last question: What are you most looking forward to at Consensus?  So, one of the biggest lifelines for our project has been Bitcoin. And I know that Consensus is a great place to go and meet people who have pioneered some of these technologies we are using today.  I'm hoping that we're able to come and talk about the things that we’ve been doing with blockchain, which is not necessarily just DeFi trading. We really want people to know that, “Hey, we can use this to fight water problems, to fight poverty."" The idea of distributed ledgers is super powerful. More people need to know that there's actual examples of this being played out.  Great sentiment.

27807910,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=607986,1715720420,Bitcoin: This Indicator Flashes Green For The First Time Since January 2024,"According to the candlestick arrangement in the daily chart, Bitcoin is moving inside a range. BTC is also down roughly 20% from the all-time high at spot rates. Though the series of lower lows posted in the past few trading days is bearish, one analyst is upbeat, expecting an encouraging recovery in the sessions ahead. This Indicator Flashes Green: Time For Bitcoin To Rally? Taking to X, the analyst notes that the 50-day Williams %R oscillator is turning from oversold territory, signaling that the bear run could end. Historically, the indicator has accurately signaled buying opportunities whenever it turns from oversold territory. The Williams %R oscillator is a crucial technical indicator chartists use to assess momentum and identify potential oversold or overbought conditions. When the indicator falls below -80, it suggests the asset being analyzed is oversold, potentially indicating a buying opportunity. Conversely, when it rises above +20, it may mean that the asset is overbought, prompting the trader to adjust their strategy accordingly. Related Reading: Newbie Bitcoin Whales Buying 200,000 BTC Per Week, Data Shows Since the beginning of 2023, the analyst observes that the 50-day Williams %R oscillator mapping Bitcoin prices has dipped into oversold territory on four occasions. Notably, each time the oscillator reversed from this zone, BTC prices rose in tandem. Now, with the Williams %R oscillator returning from the oversold territory roughly ten days ago, the analyst is optimistic. It returned from the oversold territory in January 2024, preceding the bull run in Q1 2024. If past performance is anything to go by, BTC is likely ready for a leg up. Considering the extended sideways movement and lower lows since prices peaked in mid-March 2024, this development will be a massive boost for the coin. Does BTC Stand A Chance After Extended Consolidation? The asset has become more dynamic since the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Broader market conditions, such as regulatory changes, macroeconomic trends, and investor sentiment increasingly influence it. Subsequently, this dynamism can impact the accuracy of technical indicators like the Williams % R oscillator. This tool lags and doesn’t factor in events in real time. Therefore, while the oscillator has been reliable in the past, it may not necessarily accurately predict the future cycle. For this reason, the coming days and weeks will be crucial for Bitcoin. If the price breaks out of its current range upwards, it could lend credence to the bullish interpretation. Related Reading: Brace For Impact: Mt.

42418227,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcxjh,1715718717,The Hard Truths and Worrying Consequences of the Tornado Cash Verdict,"There are hard truths in life, and then there are the things we want to believe. The sentencing of Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev to 64 months in prison in the Netherlands shows how these two things are often at odds. On both sides of the debate over the sanctioned crypto mixer, there are bad arguments and even worse conclusions.  Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates. This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  First, it was always painfully obvious that the now sanctioned crypto mixer Tornado Cash was designed to shield people’s identities, thereby facilitating crime. If it wasn’t, then it wouldn’t be very useful for protecting people like peace activists or political dissidents who need privacy – like Vitalik Buterin sending funds to Ukraine activists with a pitstop through Tornado Cash.  Moreover, it was always the case that jostling together funds from a variety of sources, licit and illicit, was likely to be construed as a form of money laundering.  Sure, Tornado Cash’s developers never took custody of the funds and therefore never directly, personally facilitated money laundering, but they did build an unstoppable smart contract without any of the types of controls that money transmitters are usually subject to like collecting and verifying identifying information from users to aid investigations.  That was essentially the argument of the Dutch prosecutors who tried Pertsev: that the 31-year-old Russian national living in the Netherlands, and his colleagues Roman Storm and Roman Semenov (who face similar charges in the U.S.), made a series of choices about how to design, upkeep and market their mixer.  See also: Tornado Cash Devs Are Caught in a U.S. Dragnet | Opinion  “The decision of the Dutch courts to condemn and impose a heavy prison sentence on Alexey Pertsev seems unjust and disproportionate, given the novelty of the technology and the numerous legitimate uses of Tornado Cash,” crypto lawyer Fatemeh Fannizadeh told CoinDesk. “The decentralized, disintermediated, and censorship-resistant nature of blockchain does not align perfectly with traditional patterns of regulated behavior and should therefore be treated with a more nuanced legal approach.”  Indeed, part of Pertsev’s defense was acknowledging that, even if money laundering was happening, because the protocol operated like a robot on a blockchain and users always maintained ""exclusive control” over their funds, if anyone is to blame it is the users themselves. This is to say nothing that Tornado’s devs did maintain a frontend, through which 90+% of users went through.  This has somewhat dangerous implications. As money blogger J.P. Koning points out, if people could simply absolve themselves of the responsibility of building and deploying a machine they know could and likely would be used by criminals, then “anyone who wants to facilitate illegal activities would have a strong incentive to copy Tornado Cash.”  “In a world in which the Tornado Cash defense prevails and payments companies adopt it as a techno-legal shield against money laundering charges,” attempts to stymie crime become less effective, “and not because we decided to soften them via a democratic process, but because financial institutions found sneaky ways to get around the rules,” he continued.  See also: Cloning Tornado Cash Would Be Easy, but Risky | Opinion  Still, at the same time, there are many worrying aspects of the case against Pertsev. Perhaps most significantly was the judge’s ruling from the bench that there was “no legitimate use” of Tornado Cash – as if privacy itself is a crime. Even though there were many legitimate uses of anonymizing one’s blockchain history, according to authorities every dollar that passed through was suspect.  Then there is the stultifying conclusion that, apparently, developers are somehow responsible for how people use their programs. This is not just a fundamental misunderstanding of how immutable smart contract protocols work, but there is seemingly no end to the liability this could cause for anyone who builds anything, and not just software.  Are gun manufacturers held liable for shootings? Is the U.S. government responsible if physical cash is used for crime? The double standard in Pertsev’s case is troubling. As the DeFi Education Fund put it in an amicus brief: “With no limiting principle in place, nearly all developers who create open-source software would be exposed to criminal liability for activity outside of their control years or decades later.”  Does this mean governments will actually begin to pursue cases against disadvantaged developers, perhaps working in politically unfavorable industries? That remains to be seen. But whether or not you agree with the interpretation of the law, the hard truth here is that mixers aren’t just about privacy and human rights – and to the extent that they facilitate crime, authorities will want to shut them down.  And if they can’t, someone is going to be held responsible.

The meme coin niche has witnessed a strong resurgence in the past day, with the entire niche up by 7.82%. Shiba Inu has particularly done well and witnessed a strong volume of interest amidst this uptick. Interestingly, this uptick in volume for SHIB has surpassed DOGE, with on-chain data suggesting SHIB could do better in the short term. At the same time, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has revealed a phenomenon that could lead to a 20% upswing for SHIB. Shiba Inu Volume Flips Dogecoin Data from Coinmarketcap shows that Shiba Inu has witnessed a trading volume increase of 320% in the past 24 hours. The metric, on Dogecoin’s side, was an increase of 160%. The crypto, which has been trading inside a descending channel for a while, is now appearing to make a push above. Related Reading: Analyst Who Predicted Solana’s 1,100% Move Reveals Where The Altcoin Is Headed Next Although current data from analytics platform IntoTheBlock (ITB) suggests DOGE is still holding on for a longer-term overperformance over SHIB, SHIB is starting to position itself to outperform DOGE in the short term on a cost basis. According to ITB’s holding by time metric, DOGE has seen a 1.86% increase in the number of holders in the past 30 days, compared to a 0.43% increase for SHIB. ITB terms holders as passive investors that have held the asset for more than one year. However, the number of cruisers (investors holding between 1 to 12 months) flips the short-term interest in the favor of SHIB. As of this writing, SHIB’s cruisers have increased by +5.69% in a 30-day timeframe. The metric, on DOGE’s side, shows a 2.44% decrease. SHIB To Breakout Of Parallel Channel The recent increase in volume and short-term activity suggests that SHIB is ready to break out of a descending parallel channel of lower highs. As pointed out on social media by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, SHIB has been trading in a descending parallel channel since the last week of April. Current price action shows SHIB is now at the upper end of the descending and is at a critical junction for a breakout or reversal. Related Reading: Analyst Points Out Level To Beat If Bitcoin Is To Reach $76,000 According to the analyst, a breakout from this channel at $0.00002444 could lead to another 20% upswing to $0.00002954. The price target serves as the highest point of the descending channel under consideration. A further surge could see SHIB returning back to the $0.00003 price territory.

42418225,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcxgb,1715716061,"Vitalik Buterin's Ethereum Wallet Proposal, Scribbled in 22 Minutes, Gets Positive Reviews","After a technical proposal to improve Ethereum wallets met with some opposition, a familiar figure swooped in last week to devise an alternative: none other than Vitalik Buterin, the blockchain's co-founder.  It reportedly took him 22 minutes.  The origin of the story dates back to last month, when Ethereum developers decided to include Ethereum improvement proposal EIP-3074 – allowing for certain functions in wallets to be controlled by smart contracts – in its next big network upgrade, known as the Pectra hard fork.  The work to make Ethereum wallets less clunky is part of a technological move called account abstraction, in which Ethereum externally-owned account (EOA) wallets, the most popular on the blockchain, are turned into smart-contract wallets.  After EIP-3074 was released, some in the community praised the proposal, while others expressed their displeasure. The main concern was that it was not compatible with an earlier proposal, called ERC-4437, which has been on mainnet since February 2023.  A couple days after EIP-3074 was released, Buterin co-wrote a new one, EIP-7702, which serves as an alternative to what is now included in the upcoming Pectra upgrade.  Ethereum core developer Ansgar Dietrichs, who co-wrote EIP-3074 and EIP-7702 with Buterin, said in an interview with CoinDesk via chat that the newest proposal was “the result of a week or so of him being involved in the account abstraction research conversation.”  After the research was done, Dietrichs said, Buterin “indeed speedran the process of writing that EIP.”  “I challenged him to do it in 15,"" Dietrichs recalled. ""It took him 22.”  Since the release of EIP-7702, many have praised the alternative, and it seems likely to replace the original EIP-3074.  ""There is positive sentiment among all stakeholder groups"" for Buterin's alternative, Christine Kim, a vice president of research at the digital-asset firm Galaxy, wrote in a May 20 research note.  Jarrod Watts, the developer relations engineer at Polygon, wrote on X that “It's one of the most impactful changes Ethereum is going to have... EVER.”  For now, EIP-3074 is still considered to go live with Pectra. That might change once the details of EIP-7022 are worked out.  “People are still understanding the exact differences to 3074,” Dietrichs told CoinDesk. “But I would say it’s pretty likely that we will replace 3074 with it.”  Galaxy's Kim suggested that the episode offered an example of how Ethereum's decentralized governance works in practice.  ""It can result in constructive dialogue between different stakeholder groups in an open-source project that ultimately results in a new path forward with higher consensus among participants than before,"" Kim wrote.  Once Buterin got involved, it didn't take long.

42418244,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcxw5,1715714178,How to Buy Solana,"Solana is a high-speed blockchain platform capable of processing up to 65,000 transactions per second, with SOL as its native token.  There are multiple methods to purchase SOL, including purchasing from centralized or decentralized exchanges, each with its own advantages and drawbacks.  The rise of meme coins on Solana has significantly increased network activity, but they come with higher risks that investors should strongly consider before purchasing.  Cryptocurrency exchanges spend millions of marketing dollars convincing potential customers that purchasing solana {{SOL}}, or any other cryptocurrency is quick and easy. They aren’t wrong. The act of purchasing cryptocurrency is quite simple.  However, it is vital that potential investors have a thorough understanding of solana (SOL), the native token of the Solana blockchain, including how the Solana blockchain works and which purchase methods are best for their geographic location when designing an investment strategy.  Understanding Solana and SOL  Solana is a smart contract-compatible blockchain platform that distinguishes itself from competitors with its hybrid consensus mechanism, a combination of proof-of-history and proof-of-stake. Solana’s unique consensus mechanism allows nodes, devices which validate and store transaction information on the blockchain, to process transactions without the need to communicate with one another, significantly reducing transaction processing time.  With its ability to theoretically process up to 65,000 transactions per second, Solana has been dubbed by the Blockchain Council as one of the fastest and most efficient blockchains in existence. This efficiency has an impact on network fees.  A network fee in the Solana ecosystem is the amount of SOL that an individual will pay to compensate node operators to process and validate their transactions. Solana’s efficiency reduces transaction costs, making it a preferred blockchain for meme coins and NFT transactions.  SOL has two primary functions in the Solana ecosystem. The first function, as mentioned, is to serve as payment to node operators for processing transactions and the second is to function as a mechanism to secure the Solana network via staking.  However, investors can also purchase SOL with the intention of holding, hoping that the price will increase in value against fiat currencies. There are a variety of ways in which SOL can be purchased. While crypto exchanges may convince users that buying SOL is simple and easy, the truth is that the best way to purchase the token depends on an investor's aptitude with cryptocurrencies and personal investment strategy.  Choosing the right platform to buy SOL  According to CoinMarketCap, there are over 200 different centralized cryptocurrency exchanges in existence. With so many options, it is imperative that potential SOL investors choose the right exchange for their geographic region, their investment strategies and their comfort level with keeping ownership over their own digital assets.  Due to regulatory restrictions, not every cryptocurrency exchange operates in every country. It is always a good idea to check that the crypto exchange you plan to purchase SOL on is legally allowed to operate in the country you reside. There are also potential benefits to choosing a crypto exchange that is familiar with the tax and legal requirements of a specific country.  For instance, crypto exchanges that operate in the United States are likely to be more familiar with IRS tax reporting requirements and provide users with both information and documentation for tax reporting purposes.  You may also want to consider using a decentralized crypto exchange to buy SOL. Decentralized crypto exchanges operate without a central authority, where trades occur directly between users’ wallets and liquidity pools. Decentralized crypto exchanges use smart contracts to automate order matching and settlement.  In comparison centralized crypto exchanges are operated by a company that acts as an intermediary between buyers and sellers. They manage the order book, match buy and sell orders and facilitate trading.  Each platform has its benefits and drawbacks, highlighted below.  Purchasing SOL on a centralized exchange  Benefits  Liquidity: Centralized exchanges often have higher liquidity, or the availability of liquid assets in a market, making it easier to buy and sell SOL quickly.  Ease-of-use: Centralized exchanges are generally more user-friendly, offering intuitive interfaces and customer support.  Regulation: Some users may prefer centralized exchanges due to the potential oversight of regulators and guardrails implemented by established crypto companies.  Drawbacks  Custodial risk: When purchasing SOL on a centralized exchange, the exchange acts as a custodian of the tokens on the buyer’s behalf. Users have to trust the exchange with their funds, which can be vulnerable to hacking and mismanagement.  Centralized control: Centralized crypto exchanges have control over vast amounts of funds and trading activities in the crypto financial system, which can lead to issues like trading downtime or manipulation.  Privacy concerns: Centralized exchanges may require extensive personal information for KYC verification, raising privacy concerns.  Purchasing SOL on a decentralized exchange  Benefits  Security: Decentralized exchanges reduce the risk of hacks and theft since users retain control of their private keys and funds.  Anonymity: Unsers can trade on decentralized exchanges without extensive KYC and user screening requirements.  Fees: Users still have to pay fees when purchasing SOL on a decentralized exchange. However, they only need to pay the network fee, the payment to node operators mentioned earlier. They do not need to pay additional fees to a centralized exchange.  Drawbacks  Liquidity: Liquidity can be lower compared to centralized exchanges, leading to potential issues with executing large trades.  User experience: Some decentralized exchanges may have a steeper learning curve and less intuitive interfaces compared to their centralized counterparts. Users will also have the responsibility of managing and securing their own private keys.  Smart contract risks: Issues with smart contracts, such as bugs or vulnerabilities, can result in financial losses for users.  The purchasing process for buying SOL  How to buy SOL on a centralized exchange  To purchase SOL on a centralized exchange, first, choose a reputable crypto exchange that supports it, such as Coinbase, Binance or Kraken. Create an account by providing your email address and setting a strong password.  For security, complete the identity verification process, which typically requires a photo ID. After verifying your account, secure it further by enabling two-factor authentication (like Google Authenticator). You can then deposit funds using a bank transfer, credit card or other payment methods available on the exchange. Keep in mind that centralized exchanges can charge different fees based on the method used to fund the account.  Once your account is funded, navigate to the SOL trading section of the crypto exchange, select the appropriate trading pair (like SOL/USD) and execute your purchase. Always review the transaction details before executing the transaction.  How to buy SOL on a decentralized exchange  To buy SOL on a DEX such as Jupiter or Raydium, you will first need a wallet compatible with the Solana network. Ensure your wallet is funded with enough crypto to complete the purchase and cover the transaction fee. Connect your wallet to the DEX website; this often involves scanning a QR code or selecting a wallet connection option.  Once connected, choose the trading pair that matches your funding source (e.g., SOL/USDC). Set the amount of SOL you wish to buy and check the current liquidity and slippage to ensure you receive a fair exchange rate. Confirm the transaction, and once it’s processed, the purchased SOL will appear in your wallet.  Remember, trading on a DEX removes the intermediary but requires careful handling of your private keys and wallet security.  Buying Solana meme coins  According to data from Hello Moon, the number of active daily users on the Solana blockchain reached an all-time high in mid-March of 2024. The price of SOL also experienced strong bullish momentum. What caused this surge in activity?  In an interview with Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko, CoinDesk’s Sam Kessler highlighted that growth in activity was due to meme coin transactions. Meme coins are digital tokens on a blockchain that are often inspired by animals, jokes or themes popular on the internet. Meme coin prices are often more volatile than other types of cryptocurrencies.  The process of buying meme coins on Solana is relatively the same as purchasing SOL. However, there are extra considerations that need to be made when purchasing meme coins. Meme coins are rife with scams but the allure of a quick pay day can blind some investors to the risks.  It is strongly recommended that investors interested in diving into the meme coin game thoroughly assess their personal risk tolerance and devise a sound investment strategy. Never invest more than you are willing to lose. CoinDesk also offers a thorough explainer on purchasing meme coins safely.  Securing purchased SOL  After purchasing SOL, buyers need to protect their investment. If SOL was purchased on a centralized crypto exchange, the crypto exchange acts as custodian of the cryptocurrency and users do not need to worry about securing their private keys but accounts still need to be protected.  Ensure your account is protected with a strong alphanumeric password and turn on two-factor authentication (2FA), though preferably not SMS, which lacks end-to-end encryption. It is wise to regularly update passwords.  If purchased on a decentralized exchange, the buyer acts as custodian of their private keys and needs to keep them secure. Private keys can be stored in either a cold wallet that is not connected to the internet or a hot wallet that is connected to the internet.  It is recommended that investors planning on holding SOL over longer periods of time store their crypto in a cold wallet, which are less vulnerable to hacks if never used to sign a transaction online. Never share your private keys with anyone, ever.

Other feline-themed tokens, including POPCAT, MichiCoin (MICHI), and Roaring Kitty (ROAR), also saw a significant surge. Popcat has registered a 24.4% and 276% increase in the one-day and monthly timeframes, while MichiCoin surged 38.9% in the past day and 333.5% since its launch on April 26. Both tokens also saw an 80% increase in the daily trading volume. Among the top gainers were the tokens inspired by the trader.

42418238,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcxrx,1715711400,"The Crypto Industry’s Influence on U.S. Elections is Bigger Than Ever, Industry Insiders Say","The crypto lobby is more powerful than ever this year, and has already shaped some key Congressional elections  The crypto industry is hoping that a friendlier and more educated group of lawmakers could finally push through a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies  Though crypto-holding voters tend to prefer Trump for president, industry insiders are split on whether or not a Trump presidency would actually be better for crypto  The crypto industry is throwing its weight around in Washington in hopes of influencing the upcoming U.S. elections, spending an unprecedented amount of money to get crypto-friendly candidates elected and educate lawmakers – all in hopes of finally getting a friendly regulatory framework for crypto established.  Crypto-focused political action committees (PACs) like Fairshake – which has raised around $85 million from a collection of crypto companies, executives and retail investors – have successfully shaped the outcome of some relevant races, including spending $10 million helping squash the bid of crypto-critical Congresswoman Katie Porter (D-Calif.).  Fairshake has also poured money into two affiliated PACs: Defend American Jobs, which donates to Republican candidates, and Protect Progress, which donates to Democrats. Both have donated to winning campaigns. Over the last two months, Defend American Jobs spent nearly $500,000 on media buys for Republican Mark Messmer, an Indiana state senator, who won the Republican nomination for Indiana’s 8th district congressional seat this week.  Some of Protect Progress’ crypto-friendly Democratic candidates, including Shomari Figures, who is running for a House seat in Alabama and Julie Johnson in Texas, have also won their primaries with media buy help.  ""It’s at a level that we just haven’t seen in past election cycles,"" said Kristin Smith, CEO of crypto lobbying group the Blockchain Association.  Industry insiders say the economic power of the industry has even spurred some crypto skeptics – including Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, who is up for re-election this year – to take a more open-minded stance towards crypto, lest they face well-funded opposition efforts from the industry.  ""Previously he was no friend of crypto but recently [Brown] said he was open to considering cryptocurrency legislation,"" said Kyle Bligen, director of financial policy at the tech-focused Chamber of Progress. ""I think he’s cognizant of the money from outside industry groups that are looking for politicians that are open to reasonable, common-sense cryptocurrency policies and aren't just trying to prop up or support the traditional financial ecosystem without allowing for innovation.""  Though the industry’s past efforts to shape national-level election outcomes have been largely unsuccessful – and, in the case of former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, criminal – the crypto industry’s growing political influence now seems to have more staying power.  ""It’s a much more sophisticated operation,"" Smith said. ""I feel like I used to walk around Washington, and people would say ‘Oh, there’s Kristin, she works for that little blockchain industry thing.’ Now it’s like, ‘Oh wow, that’s the powerful crypto industry and they’re here to influence Washington and are pulling out all the tools to do it.""  All eyes on the Presidential  Though the crypto industry has largely focused its lobbying efforts on Congressional elections, the U.S. presidential election will also have a significant impact on crypto regulation.  According to at least one small poll commissioned by crypto investment firm Paradigm,, crypto-holding voters tend to prefer Donald Trump for president – although, according to other polls, the percentage of voters who own crypto is small. Polymarket bettors currently give Trump the slight edge to win (47% to Biden’s 44%). But industry insiders are less certain on whether a Trump presidency would actually be better for crypto.  During his presidency Trump was outspoken about his distaste for crypto but has since softened his stance, even saying earlier this week that he was open to accepting crypto campaign donations. In an interviews with CNBC earlier this year, Trump admitted to dabbling in the markets himself (he has sold several tranches of non-fungible tokens) and said that he is ""not sure [he would] want to take it away at this point,"" though implied that he could move to curb crypto’s influence if it ever undermined the dominance of the U.S. dollar.  Though Trump’s crypto stance is shifting, it’s still markedly less crypto-friendly than that of his former competitor for the Republican presidential nomination, Vivek Ramaswamy, who pledged to protect crypto developers and create a clear regulatory structure for crypto that would see most tokens as commodities.  Even though Ramawamy is no longer in the running – and will reportedly not be considered as Trump’s running mate – industry insiders suggest his crypto policies could still have an influence on Trump if he’s elected.  ""Trump looks to Vivek on tech and digital asset policy,"" claimed Lee Bratcher, founder and president of the Texas Blockchain Council. ""He didn’t always do that, but when he saw how Vivek captured the Republican voter – and more centrist [voters] than Trump can capture – he’s probably more interested in that [policy].""  Biden, re-elected  Industry insiders were split on whether a Biden re-election would be bad for the crypto industry.  Smith said it would likely be ""more of the same, unless [Securities and Exchange Commission Chair] Gary Gensler decides to step aside,"" meaning continued regulatory uncertainty and aggressive enforcement actions. A better, more open-minded SEC chair, she added, would be ""hugely helpful.""  ""It’s unfortunate because, at the beginning of the Biden Administration there was some interest in crypto – and then the industry imploded while they were doing all of their reports and as a result they’re in a clearly negative spot right now,"" Smith said. ""On [Biden’s] watch, the industry had some not-so-great moments and it’s understandable that regulators are concerned.""  Smith said that, while the crypto industry has largely moved on from the 2022 crypto collapse – including the implosions of FTX, Terra/LUNA and Three Arrows Capital – regulators have much longer memories.  ""Having a fresh batch of regulators come in would be helpful in re-starting conversations,"" Smith said.  Others, like Bligen, seemed more hopeful for crypto-friendly legislation to pass post-election if Biden stays in power.  ""I can’t say that if President Biden is reelected that that’s a loss for cryptocurrency advocates, because currently in this regime Democrats and Republicans are working together on a bipartisan basis to produce productive and responsible cryptocurrency [legislation],"" said Bligen.  There are ongoing efforts in the current Congress to pass crypto legislation, including a bipartisan effort to regulate stablecoins.  Challenges to progress  Those efforts at legislation – which, in the past, have failed to find footing – still have significant hurdles to clear before being passed, including getting more members of Congress on board with crypto.  Bligen said that there are still many members of Congress who don’t know much about crypto, and the things they do know about it ""come from flashy headlines about cryptocurrency scams, people misrepresenting coins, people being defrauded out of their money, massive crypto institutions failing – they view it from a protectionist angle,"" he said.  ""If you want to have more people that are friendly to crypto, every single office needs to be provided with a base understanding of what is cryptocurrency, why does it matter to my constituents and what is the policy landscape that regulates it. Everybody needs to know that,"" Bligen said. ""If you don’t have that basic information, you’re going to have members fumbling around, trying to grasp what blockchain technology is…there needs to be more concerted education efforts. We’re not just going to get to a more educated 2025, work has to be put in.""  Bratcher added that, in addition to education efforts, the industry may have to compromise on certain issues – like privacy – in order to make real progress with lawmakers.  ""We stand at an interesting crossroads when it comes to privacy,"" Bratcher said, referencing the ongoing crackdown on bitcoin mixing services like Tornado Cash and Samourai Wallet.  ""People in the digital assets industry want to prioritize privacy above everything else. When we work with government – state, local and national, and even with law enforcement – we don’t have the luxury of being able to make grandiose claims around that, Bratcher added. ""There will have to be a balance between privacy and issues pertaining to money laundering and national security.""  Bratcher said that bad behavior by privacy services like Samourai – which actively promoted its mixing services to ""dark/grey market participants"" – makes working with elected officials much harder.  ""Tornado Cash is not a hill I’m willing to die on,"" Bratcher said. ""We could lose a war if we choose to die on the hill of Tornado Cash.""  State-level politics  Though the spotlight is on national elections, Bratcher and others – like Dennis Porter, CEO and co-founder of bitcoin mining advocacy group Satoshi Action Fund – are focusing their efforts on state politics.  Porter’s group has helped introduce bills in 16 U.S. states that provide protections for bitcoin mining and self-custody. The furthest along of the bills is in Oklahoma, where it has been passed in both the state House and Senate, and is awaiting a signature by Governor Kevin Stitt (R).  ""D.C. is fun and sexy. Tons of money is spent there, but so far we haven’t seen any big wins – all of the important battles are happening at the state level,"" Porter said.  Porter said the industry should continue to build its presence in D.C. but said that it will not find the magical cure to all of its ills on Capitol Hill.  ""The way that we’re going to do that is at the state level,"" Porter said. ""We’re going to go state-by-state advocating for pro-digital assets policy using the states as a laboratory for democracy, eventually taking those good ideas and using them to influence policy at the federal level. Or at the bare minimum, creating a regulatory regime that protects people at the state level.""  Porter’s model for crypto regulation takes a page out of the cannabis industry’s playbook – building up momentum and support in the states until the industry is powerful enough to shape federal regulations.  ""We’re swinging for home runs over and over and over again in D.C. but we’re not strong enough yet,"" Porter said. ""I just think we’re further away from that than we realize…The big story for me is that we need to be spending much more time at the state level, investing much more money, because the hundreds of millions of dollars being spent in D.C., if spent at the state level, would radically reshape the policy landscape and would radically change the dynamic for bitcoin and digital assets in America.""",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/05/14/the-crypto-industrys-influence-on-us-elections-is-bigger-than-ever-industry-insiders-say,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/901944c6dda50496883edca6a70899e618bfde9e-1367x769.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

27800652,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=607965,1715709630,"Is Ethereum Set For A Major Rally? Options Traders Bet Big On $3,600+ Targets For June","Ethereum (ETH) options for June show a marked interest in higher strike prices, focusing on levels exceeding $3,600. Data from Deribit reveals a concentrated bet among traders on calls surpassing this price, indicating a bullish sentiment toward Ethereum’s near-term trajectory. The most favored strike price among these optimistic bets is an ambitious $6,500. Related Reading: Can Ethereum Price Repeat Pattern and Start Fresh Surge To $3,200? Options Market Bullish On Ethereum Notably, options are contracts that give traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy (in the case of calls) or sell (in the case of puts) the underlying asset at a specified strike price by the expiry date. A call option is typically purchased by traders who believe the asset will increase in price, allowing them to buy at a lower rate and potentially sell at a higher market price. Conversely, put options are favored by those anticipating a decline in the asset’s price, aiming to sell at the current rate and repurchase at a lower value. Currently, the Ethereum options market is tilting heavily towards calls, with the aggregate open interest—representing the total number of outstanding contract options—showing a preference for higher strike prices. This concentration of calls, primarily above the $3,600 mark, suggests that a significant market segment is positioning for Ethereum to ascend to higher levels by the end of June. According to Deribit data, roughly 622,636 Ethereum call contracts are set to expire by June’s end, encapsulating a notional value above $1.8 billion. Such substantial positioning underscores the market’s confidence in Ethereum’s potential uplift. Data further shows that the most substantial open interest is clustered around the $6,500 strike price, with a notional value of $193 million. This concentration reflects trader optimism and supports Ethereum’s market price, especially if these options are exercised as the asset price approaches or surpasses these strike levels. Despite the optimism embedded in these options, Ethereum is currently navigating a slight downturn. It has dropped 5.4% over the past week and 2.2% in the last 24 hours, positioning it below $2,900. This decline places even more focus on upcoming market catalysts that could significantly sway ETH’s price. Regulatory Decisions And Technical Indicators: A Dual Influence on ETH’s Path One significant upcoming event is the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) decision on several applications for Ethereum-based Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), which is due by May 25th. This decision is pivotal as approval could usher in a wave of institutional investments into Ethereum, potentially catapulting its price. Conversely, rejection could dampen the bullish sentiment and lead to further pullbacks. From a technical analysis standpoint, signs are pointing to a possible rebound. The “Bullish Cypher Pattern,” identified by the analyst Titan Of Crypto, suggests that Ethereum could be at a turning point. Currently, Ethereum is at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level, a key support zone in many bull markets.

27800176,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=608026,1715708894,Investors Shift From Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) Meme Coins to Online Casino Extraordinaire Rollblock (RBLK),"The crypto market is increasingly moving away from Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) meme coins. Instead, traders are switching focus to coins with utility as utility season beckons. In the lead of such a shift is Rollblock (RBLK) – a Stage 1 presale star that many analysts hint to become the next $1 break out crypto star in 2024. Solana (SOL) Reveals Arcium Solana (SOL) has recently been making waves in the crypto market. Notably, Solana announced that the first parallelized confidential computing network—Arcium—will soon enter its ecosystem. This bullish Solana news may trigger a rally for this crypto, which has soared 587% in the past year alone. The technical analysis of the Solana crypto shows many bullish signals. For example, SOL is now trading above its 100 and 200-day EMAs while boasting 16 green technical indicators. Thus, experts predict a potential jump to $151 for Solana within Q2 of 2024. However, many SOL-based meme coins like MYRO remain red on the price charts. Ethereum Price Analysis: Showing Bullish Signs Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) meme coins are also facing some trouble, as Shiba Inu and Floki are showing red on the one-month charts. However, Ethereum continues its growth in the crypto market, as CoinMarketCap data shows it jumped 60% on the YTD chart. Simultaneously, its market cap surged from $217B to $356B at that same time. The technical analysis of Ethereum also paints a bullish picture. Currently, Ethereum is trading above its 100 and 200-day EMAs. Also, the Stoch RSI signal sits at 16.3 in the buy zone. As a result, market analysts have made a bullish Ethereum price prediction. They forecast a surge to $3,600 before Q2 of 2024 ends. Rollblock (RBLK): Among the Best Coins To Invest In Rollblock (RBLK) is becoming one of the top crypto coins and it is making a splash in the market with its presale performance. It has already sold over 12M tokens and raised almost $125K, with projections hinting at $600K before May 2024 ends. This indicates that traders all over the world are in great demand for this unique GambleFi protocol. Rollblock aims to become a major player in the online gambling sector, which is now worth $450B. This is why it launched a unique online crypto casino that combines the best decentralization and centralization features. As a result, Rollblock lets you sign up using an email only and no KYC checks or extra downloads are required—full anonymity for all. The RBLK utility token is the fuel of this platform, offering holding benefits such as regular rakebacks and passive income opportunities. In fact, Rollblock’s unique revenue-sharing model means that up to 30% of its weeklt earnings will go to RBLK holders in the form of token buy backs. Half of those tokens are burned from the supply forever and the other half will be used to offer investors some of the best staking rewards available in the crypto space. At the moment, RBLK is worth only $0.01 in Stage 1 of its presale. However, more price pumps will occur as the presale advances. Market analysts even predict a potential rise to $1 once a Tier-1 CEX lists RBLK in Q3 of 2024. With this prediction, RBLK emerges as the best crypto investment right now. Why Are Solana and Ethereum Traders Gravitating Towards Rollblock? The $10M market cap for Rollblock makes it attractive to Solana and Ethereum traders, who can anticipate much larger returns. RBLK needs way fewer new funds for its price to skyrocket than its peers, so traders view RBLK as one of the best cryptos to invest in.

For some, the bottom has already been met, while for others, there are still more price crashes to come. However, one analyst’s prediction in particular stands out and this is due to his track record of accurately calling the top of the market back in the 2021 bull market. Crypto Expert Says Bitcoin Bottom Is In Crypto expert Dave the Wave first came into prominence back in 2021 when he had accurately predicted the Bitcoin top. Given this, Dave’s analysis holds weight in the crypto market, so it is no surprise that his most recent prediction calling the Bitcoin bottom is making the rounds. Related Reading: Gaming The System: Pundit Reveals Why XRP Price Will Reach $33 In the analysis which was posted on X (formerly Twitter), the crypto analyst points to a number of indicators that show that the Bitcoin bottom has already been reached. One of these is the MACD which the analyst reveals is still far off from the levels from the last bull market. In addition to the MACD still trending below this level, the crypto expert points out that the crypto market is more mature than it was. Given this maturing market, Dave the Wave stated: “It wouldn’t at all surprise me to see something different develop, pattern-wise, over the longer time frame.” The analyst suggests that the Bitcoin low is actually in, and given that the price had fallen to $57,000 a couple of weeks ago, Dave’s analysis suggests that that is as low as the price will go. If this holds, then it is possible that the Bitcoin price will not fall below $60,000 before it resumes its bull rally. BTC Price Expectations Still Bullish Despite the slow momentum that has plagued the Bitcoin price, investors continue to be bullish on the cryptocurrency. This is evidenced by the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index maintaining a firm grip on the Greed territory, showing that investors are still willing to buy into the market. Related Reading: Theta Network Breakout Imminent: Why A 100% Rise Is Possible From Here Furthermore, predictions from crypto analysts such as Rekt Capital have shown expectations for further price increases. Rekt Capital predicts that the BTC price will still cross $100,000 as long as the price is able to break above $63,000 and hold this level. However, elsewhere in social media, there is a change in tide for the BTC price as social sentiment begins to fall to bearish headwinds.

Titan of Crypto analysis examines the aforementioned level as a pivotal point for Bitcoin that could determine the coin’s next price trajectory. $61,500, A Level To Watch For Bitcoin Today, May 14, BTC witnessed a sharp decline to nearly $61,500, demonstrating little momentum for a price recovery. While many would see this as a worrying development, Titan of Crypto considers it a noteworthy development. He sees this level as significant and is one to watch out for for Bitcoin. The crypto expert further warns of an impending volatility in the market around Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell‘s speech later today. Thus, Titan of Crypto has urged the community to remember that it’s better to hold off on making decisions until after the BTC daily candle closes and until the next one confirms the previous one. The post read: Bitcoin $61,500 is the level to watch. Expect volatility in the markets around today’s Powell speech. In any case, remember it’s wiser to wait for the BTC daily candle close and confirmation with the following one before jumping to a conclusion. Although the expert anticipates volatility for Bitcoin, he is confident that the crypto asset’s bull run is far from over, suggesting a movement on the upside is still possible. Related Reading: Why Bitcoin’s Post-Halving Rally Is Certain, Analyst Explains According to Titan of Crypto, Bitcoin’s Risk-Adjusted Return Oscillator (RAR) indicator has recently moved into the overbought area. However, the analyst asserts that this does not call for alarm, given that Bitcoin took over eight months to peak following the development based on previous bull cycles. Looking at Bitcoin’s price action from the daily timeframe, the expert confirms that the digital asset is “looking good.” As a result, BTC is following the bullish target to unprecedented heights, specifically around $112,185. “This game is a zero-sum game where impatient people give their money to the patient,” he added. Possible Retracement To $62,000 While Titan of Crypto anticipates a rally, Ali Martinez, another crypto, has predicted an early price retracement. The expert has highlighted the possibility for BTC to decline to $62,000 in the short term. According to the analyst, the 4-hour chart’s 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) appears to be rejecting Bitcoin, whereas the TD Sequential indicator suggests a sell signal. Should the development be confirmed, Martinez expects BTC to drop to $62,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: Analyst Predicts Potential Dip To $52,000 However, for BTC to witness an upward movement, it needs to maintain a 4-hour candlestick close above the $64,000 threshold. Thus, with the coin trading below the $62,000 level, Martinez’s prediction appears to have already manifested. At the time of writing, the coin was trading at $61,512, indicating about 1.98% in the past day. Its trading volume was up by 9.67%, while its market cap was down by 2.65% in the last 24 hours.

The new stablecoin, BOLD, will coexist with Liquity's LUSD, adding liquid staking ETH derivatives as collateral assets to provide liquidity or leverage for investors.  Decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform Liquity (LQTY)'s planned upgrade will include an overcollateralized stablecoin that makes use of liquid-staking tokens of ether {{ETH}} as backing assets and allows user-set interest rates for loans, a first in DeFi, according to the protocol.  ""Current protocols either rely on slow and potentially misaligned human governance to adjust interest rates, or they don’t have a targeted way of using interest payments to drive demand for their stablecoin,"" according to a white paper published Tuesday. ""Liquity V2 will change that.""  Details of the new version, which is scheduled for late in the third quarter, arrive as new yield-earning strategies and DeFi-native stablecoins have helped lift investment returns from the depths of a crypto winter in 2022 and 2023. For example, Aave and Curve introduced their own stablecoins last year, while Ethena's ""synthetic dollar,"" USDe, which generates yield by harvesting bitcoin {{BTC}} and ETH futures premiums with a ""carry trade,"" attracted $2.3 billion in deposits.  Read more: Amid Giant Crypto Rally, Hopes for Another DeFi Summer Soar  Liquity is known as a stablecoin lender that offers 0% loans in its overcollateralized LUSD stablecoins for users depositing ETH in the protocol while charging a one-time fee. In May 2021, at the peak of the previous crypto bull market, total value locked (TVL) on the protocol surpassed $4 billion. It's now about $700 million, DefiLlama data shows.  The new stablecoin, called BOLD, will co-exist with LUSD. It will allows borrowers to take out loans by depositing ETH and liquid staking ETH derivatives as collateral while setting their preferred interest rate and plans to pay most of the revenue from borrowing fees into the stability pool and secondary markets incentivized by the protocol.  The idea behind letting borrowers set the loan rates is to align incentives: The more borrowers are willing to pay, the more revenue they contribute to the protocol to pay out for BOLD holders in stability and liquidity pools.  ""LUSD is great for its decentralized capabilities, but it doesn't have the built-in flexibility to adapt to changing market environments like rising or falling interest rates,"" Samrat Lekhak, head of business development and communications at Liquity, said in an interview over Telegram. ""In times of positive interest rates, this implies a need for a continuous yield source for the stablecoin, which BOLD provides.""

42418235,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcxor,1715699841,'Liquid Vesting' Is Oxymoronic Blockchain Feature That Lets Early Investors Sell Without Waiting,"Even in anything-goes crypto trading, there are conventions designed to protect the little guy. One of those is the vesting period – a window of time following a digital-token sale or airdrop where early investors, such as founders, project contributors and venture-capital backers, are locked up from dumping their allocations.  Projects typically do this so that the price of that token doesn’t crash immediately after a listing, say if big stakeholders were to sell right away. Another goal is to make sure insiders and early backers keep skin in the game, an assurance of good faith, as it were.  Now comes a new feature from Colony Lab, a developer and project incubator in the Avalanche blockchain ecosystem, called ""liquid vesting.""  If it sounds like a workaround, that's because it basically is. Have your bags and keep them too. Take liquidity now, without having to wait for the end of the vesting period.  “Liquid vesting allows early investors to trade their tokens before they invest without impacting the projects, without impacts in the secondary market, "" said Wessal Erradi, co-founder of Colony Labs.  The positive spin? “It also allows new buyers to establish long-term positions,” Erradi said.  Colony announced the liquid vesting feature Tuesday in conjunction with the launch of its decentralized fundraising platform, which has the stated aim of ""democratizing access to seed sales investments in early-stage projects, previously limited to a select group, including VCs and high-net-worth individuals,” the team wrote in a press release.  The rollout comes after Colony shared in November that it invested $10 million in the Avalanche blockchain ecosystem, by buying more than 500,000 AVAX tokens, which went towards a validators program for AVAX holders.  Elie Le Rest, another co-founder, said there is some precedent for this in traditional markets, but ""in crypto, not that much.”  “We had the infrastructure to be able to build something like this,” Le Rest said in an interview with CoinDesk.  How does it work?  According to Le Rest, ""we kind of tokenized again, the vesting contracts.""  ""So we issue a new token, one-to-one, that matches the ones that are locked, and then we distribute that to the users,"" Le Rest said. ""And then they can basically trade that on our decentralized exchange that we built.""  As often is the case in crypto, the solution to a token problem is another token.

Short-Term Holder Bitcoin Whales Have Continued To Accumulate Recently As explained by CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr in a post on X, the demand among the short-term holder whales has decreased since the all-time high, although it still continues to remain strong. Related Reading: Buy Or Sell Bitcoin? Quant Reveals What Leading Metric Says The “short-term holders” (STHs) refer to the Bitcoin investors who have been holding onto their coins since less than 155 days ago. This cohort includes the new investors in the market, as well as the fickle-minded traders who make moves often and don’t tend to HODL. The investors who make it past the 155-day threshold are put inside the “long-term holders” (LTHs), which is a group that’s generally considered to reflect the resolute side of the sector. In the context of the current discussion, the investors of interest aren’t the ordinary STHs, but rather the humongous entities called whales. Formally, these investors are defined as those holding more than 1,000 BTC in their wallets. At the current exchange rate, this lower limit is worth $61.5 million, which is massive indeed. Whales can be influential beings on the network because of these large holdings, so their behavior can be something worth keeping an eye on. The STH whales would naturally correspond to the large holders who only bought within the past five months. Here is a chart that shows the trend in the exchange outflows being made by these new whales in the Bitcoin market over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the 7-day simple moving average (SMA) of the Bitcoin STH whale exchange outflows had spiked to pretty high levels earlier in the year, when the rally towards the new all-time high (ATH) price had taken place. Naturally, this spike would suggest demand for buying the cryptocurrency was high from new whale investors entering the space. At the peak, the indicator implied accumulation was occurring at the rate of a whopping 452,000 BTC per week. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Be Set For New ATHs If It Breaks This Resistance: Analyst A part of this buying would correspond to the demand coming in from the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) – new investment vehicles for Bitcoin only approved at the start of this year that provide for an indirect way to invest into the asset in a format that may be preferrable for the more traditional investors. From the chart, it’s visible that the demand from the new whales has seen a clear decline in the period since the ATH, but accumulation nonetheless remains substantial as the STH whales are still potentially buying at a rate of around 200,000 BTC per week.

The trust currently trades at a 42% discount to Net Asset Value. Ethereum Classic's upcoming halving is unlikely to create bullish sentiment given the broader market lull. Introduction Specializing in structured instruments, Grayscale is a leading digital currency asset management firm that gives investors safe, regulated access to the cryptocurrency market. The Ethereum Classic Trust ( ETCG ), one of Grayscale's specialist products, is made to let investors purchase Ethereum Classic ( ETC-USD ) as a security. By removing the hassles of buying, storing, and safeguarding Ethereum Classic directly, this product makes it easier for investors to acquire exposure through a more traditional investment vehicle. The Ethereum Classic Trust shares are mostly available on the Over-the-Counter (OTC) market, where a wider variety of ordinary and institutional investors can purchase them. The main goal of ETCG's investments is to replicate Ethereum Classic's price performance while taking trust fees and other running costs into consideration. It accomplishes this by directly owning ETC, with daily share values determined by removing the trust's costs and liabilities from the current Ethereum Classic market pricing. Ethereum Classic (ETC) Price Action Since its launch in 2016, ETC has been a wild ride in terms of price fluctuations. When the Bitcoin bubble 'burst' in late 2017 and early 2018, its initial value of $2.08 skyrocketed to over $40. It then went through the crypto winter but made a huge comeback in the beginning of 2021, shooting beyond $100 to hit an all-time high of $176.16 in May. Nonetheless, it ended the year at $34.12, demonstrating the market's intrinsic volatility in cryptocurrencies. Even though 2022 was a difficult year for cryptocurrencies in general, ETC beat the market as a whole. It closed the year at $15.69 after hitting over $50 in March but suffering a number of setbacks, including market collapses and the collapse of the FTX exchange. Considering the market's general fall of over 60%, this coin fared better than many others, even though it only saw a decline of roughly 55%. Ethereum Classic's trajectory persisted until 2023, with some changes brought about by outside factors. Even though it reached a peak of $24.79 in February, it encountered difficulties like Silvergate Bank's failure and regulatory actions directed at significant exchanges. These occurrences played a part in its decline to a June low of $13.42. It concluded at $21.92 on the year, up 40% from the previous year but behind the rise of the entire cryptocurrency market. This was despite some rebound in the second part of the year. ETC saw more volatility in 2024, peaking in March at $39.62 and plunging to a low of $27.01 in April. At present, ETC is the 28th-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization trading at $27.75, with about 147 million ETC in circulation out of a total supply of 210.7 million. Although ETC has historically offered a peer like exposure to ETH at a lower cost, ETH's shift to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism has shifted their likeness. This is further complicated by ETC's performance in comparison to the overall market, which has arguably underperformed relative to bluechips, like BTC, ETH, or SOL. Ethereum Classic Trust's Performance Analysis Shifting our attention to the Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust, we can look at the Net Asset Value per share and its market price per share over time, to assess the trust's historical performance. A number of factors, including changes in underlying asset pricing, market speculation, supply and demand dynamics, and investor emotion, can cause discrepancies between the NAV and market price. The trust is said to be trading at a premium when the market price per share exceeds the NAV per share. On the other hand, the trust is selling at a discount if the market price per share is less than the NAV per share. Data by YCharts Based on the available data, Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust has a -42.38% discount to NAV. This implies that the computed NAV per share is much higher than the market price per share. Such a significant discount can be a sign of unfavorable investor sentiment or of perceived risks related to investing in ETC. So although there may be an inefficacy at play, I would argue that the risks involved, when compared to ETH, are critical when forming a final decision. The price of ETH increased by a significant 1.63K%, while the price of ETC increased by a less significant 384.5% over the past 5 years. The correlation coefficient of 0.955 between the prices of ETH and ETC indicates a very strong link between the price movements of the two assets. Data by YCharts This suggests that if one is looking for non-bitcoin crypto exposure, then the historical performance of ETH is much more interesting than ETC. Further, the strong correlation also suggests that ETC should not be seen as a point of diversification to hold in one's crypto basket. Ethereum Classic Halving ETC is about to reach a major turning point because of its upcoming halving on May 31, 2024 . This development means that mining rewards will decrease, which might have a significant impact on the dynamics of the ETC market, similar to the BTC halving last month. Though mining is profitable, especially when using efficient hardware combined with cheap power costs, it is projected that the halving would increase market volatility and possibly raise the price of ETC because fewer coins would be produced. This will also happen at a relatively untimely point in the market where we are far from seeing any all-time highs, which implies that it is unlikely to serve as a bullish catalyst given the mediocre market sentiment. Risks and Challenges Market volatility is one of the main dangers of investing in ETC. Similar to numerous cryptocurrencies, the price of ETC is subject to abrupt fluctuations. Numerous factors, such as macroeconomic trends, regulatory changes, technical improvements, and market sentiment, might contribute to this volatility. Another trust-specific risk is that investors may encounter difficulties in the ETCG market due to low liquidity risks, especially when trying to make large trades. Increased price slippage, broader spreads between ask and bid prices, and difficulty initiating or leaving positions at targeted prices can all be consequences of limited liquidity. Because of this, traders of ETCG should proceed with caution, particularly in illiquid markets or during times of high volatility. There may also be dangers if there is no redemption program. The ETCG, in contrast to certain other investment vehicles like exchange-traded funds, is devoid of a redemption mechanism . Conclusion The upcoming halving event, as well as the risks and challenges associated with investing in ETCG, led to my prudent recommendation of HOLD. Despite the volatility inherent in the cryptocurrency market and the uncertainties surrounding ETC's future, holding on to existing positions can be beneficial given the long-term potential for market shifts that would close the 42% NAV discount.

Gox is preparing to release a substantial amount of Bitcoin (BTC) into the market, signaling the upcoming disbursement of payments to creditors who had been affected by its hack attack in 2011. Mt. Gox Set To Release 142,000 Bitcoin Into Market Reports from Reddit reveal that the Kraken Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) API interface have signaled that Mt. Gox is getting ready to release its substantial cryptocurrency and fiat holdings, which include 142,000 BTC and 143,000 BCH, and 69 billion yen. Related Reading: Theta Network Breakout Imminent: Why A 100% Rise Is Possible From Here As of May 13, the interface began reading “payment in preparation,” indicating that funds would soon be distributed to creditors. The date for the anticipated disbursement has also been slated for October 31, 2024. This decision comes after years of undergoing legal proceedings and negotiations aimed at reimbursing creditors who lost funds following the Bitcoin exchange’s crash. Earlier in 2011, Mt. Gox was hacked, resulting in the loss of 850,000 BTC now worth over $51 billion. Shortly after the unfortunate attack, Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy and has since been gathering funds to compensate creditors. Reports from a few customers have revealed that the exchange has begun distributing funds in fiat currency. One particular Reddit user disclosed earlier in April, that he had received USD payments into an HSBC currency account with zero fees. While the long-awaited distribution process comes as great news to creditors, the release of such a large amount of Bitcoin could have a significant effect on the current Bitcoin market. Additionally, discussions about whether creditors would sell or retain their Bitcoin holdings once they receive their funds have been circulating. Nonetheless, the disbursement process presents a step towards closure and recovery for victims of the exchange’s hack and bankruptcy. Will Creditors Sell Or Hold? With the Bitcoin market presently in a fragile position after experiencing a series of declines following the halving event on April 20, the possibility of a large-scale sell-off could lead to drastic changes in the market, potentially resulting in a crash. Commenting on Mt. Gox’s 142,000 BTC distribution plans, a Reddit community member suggested that the exchange’s upcoming repayments could become a catalyst for the next BTC dump in 2024. Related Reading: Gaming The System: Pundit Reveals Why XRP Price Will Reach $33 In response, another Reddit user expressed doubt about the likelihood of a widespread sell-off, especially at the beginning of the bull market. The user surmised that investors who have been waiting for Mt. Gox’s payments for over a decade are unlikely to sell off their Bitcoin holdings quickly. Instead, he suggested that many creditors, like himself, would be more inclined to HODL their Bitcoin holdings, having acquired a deeper understanding of the pioneer cryptocurrency during the decade-long wait.

42418222,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcxeX,1715695200,"Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, Vitalik Buterin Back $45M Investment in Polymarket","Prediction market Polymarket raised $45 million from investors including Peter Thiel's Founders Fund and Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin.  Combined with an earlier round, the company has raised well over $70 million.  Polymarket is seeing brisk business in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election.  Polymarket, the cryptocurrency-based prediction market platform that's enjoying a breakout year in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election, raised $45 million in a series B funding round with a roster of big-name investors.  Billionaire Peter Thiel's Founders Fund is the lead investor, Polymarket founder Shayne Coplan told CoinDesk via Telegram message. Other participants include Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin, 1confirmation, ParaFi and Dragonfly Capital, Coplan said. He did not disclose how much the company was valued in the transaction.  The round follows a previously undisclosed $25 million series A led by General Catalyst, Coplan said. Factoring in a $4 million seed round in 2020, Polymarket has raised well over $70 million.  The company said it also hired Richard Jaycobs as head of market expansion to prepare for its next phase of growth. Jaycobs previously served as executives of tradfi firms, including president of the Cantor Exchange and as the CEO of The Clearing Corporation.  Polymarket is the most successful attempt to build prediction markets on crypto infrastructure. In prediction markets, traders bet money on verifiable outcomes of real-world events in a specified time frame. These events range from sporting matches to celebrity engagements to nuclear armaments.  For example, a contract on Polymarket asks if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will approve a spot exchange-traded fund for Ethereum's ether {{ETH}} by May 31. ""Yes"" shares were recently trading at 16 cents, indicating the market sees a 16% chance of it happening. Each share pays out $1 if the prediction comes true, and zero if not.  More than mere gambling, these markets create positive spillover effects by giving more accurate reads on public sentiment and more reliable forecasts than polls and pundits, advocates such as economist Robin Hanson have long argued.  Late last year, analysts at Bitwise Investments estimated that a record $100 million would be staked on crypto-based prediction markets (of which Polymarket is the largest by far) in 2024. A single contract on Polymarket has already blown past that estimate.  More than $125 million of bets have been placed on the presidential election through the platform. All told, traders have wagered $202 million on Polymarket this year, according to the company.  Polymarket has a big disadvantage: It is locked out of the U.S., the world's largest economy. Under a 2022 settlement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, it is barred from doing business with U.S. residents. This has left the field open for Kalshi, the sole CFTC-regulated prediction market platform (which settles bets in dollars rather than crypto).  However, that imprimatur is a double-edged sword. The CFTC has soured on what it calls ""event contracts;"" last week it proposed a ban on election-related bets, which would affect Kalshi and PredictIt (which operates in the U.S. under a no-action letter, or regulatory exemption) but not the already-banished Polymarket.  Coplan is scheduled to speak at CoinDesk's Consensus 2024 event in Austin, Texas, on May 31. Register here.  Thiel's Founders Fund and Thiel Capital participated in a 2021 funding round for the Bullish group, which two years later acquired CoinDesk.

Giancarlo – who's joining another one-time Washington insider, former Sen.

Re targets to back $200 million in insurance premiums by the end of the year, with another $3 billion in the pipeline.  The firm also raised $7 million in a venture capital investment round led by Electric Capital.  Re, a real-world asset (RWA) platform specializing in offering tokenized reinsurance, said Tuesday it has opened its first open-ended reinsurance fund using the Avalanche {{AVAX}} network.  First investors of the fund include Nexus Mutual, a crypto insurance alternative provider, with a $15 million allocation and the RWA-focused Vista fund of Ava Labs, an ecosystem developer organization of Avalanche, with a smaller deposit.  The company also raised $7 million in venture capital in its latest fundraising round led by Electric Capital, following a $14 million seed round in late 2022.  Re, which is regulated in the Cayman Islands, focuses on introducing blockchain tech for a traditionally opaque, conservative industry and aims to be a decentralized version of Lloyd's of London, though of as the premier marketplace for insurance.  Reinsurance companies offer protection for insurance firms, collecting premiums to cover certain types of risks. With nearly $1 trillion in premiums annually, reinsurance is a cornerstone of today's financial markets and commerce, Karn Saroya, chief executive officer of Re said in an interview with CoinDesk.  ""Reinsurance is the ocean, and insurance companies are the boats floating on the water,” he said.  Bringing these assets to blockchain rails can improve settlements, operational efficiency and create greater transparency of capital reserves, Saroya explained. This is in line with the red-hot tokenization trend, with digital asset firms and global financial institutions such as BlackRock, Citi and Franklin Templeton creating digital versions of old-school investments – often referred to as RWAs – to trade them on blockchains for operational benefits.

The fund targets to offer up to 23% annualized yield to investors, and is accessible to U.S. accredited investors and any investors outside the U.S. who complete Re's know-your-customer (KYC) process. The minimum lock-up period for deposits is one year, and funds are available for redemptions as collateral is released from the insurance companies.

After dipping below $2,820, it surged to over $3,200, only to retrace some of those gains. However, analysts remain optimistic, citing technical indicators and a key regulatory decision on the horizon as potential catalysts for a near-term price increase. Related Reading: Investment Firm Makes Bitcoin Its Strategic Reserve – Impact On Price Ethereum Price Poised For A Breakout?

By May 25th, the SEC is expected to rule on three applications for Ethereum-based Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). A green light from the SEC for these ETFs would open the door for institutional investment into Ethereum, potentially leading to a surge in demand and price. Conversely, a rejection could dampen investor sentiment and trigger a pullback.

42418240,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcxv3,1715688060,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Dips Below $62K Ahead of U.S. Inflation Figures,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin fell below $62,000 during the European morning on Tuesday, losing about 1.63% over 24 hours. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), a broad measurement of the digital asset market as a whole, fell almost 1.1%. Ether declined more than 2% to just above $2,900, while solana was largely unchanged at $145. In the next 24 hours, attention will turn to inflation reports out of the U.S. The latest Producer Price Index (PPI) is set for release at 08:30 ET today and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is due tomorrow. Stubbornly high inflation has previously put paid to hopes of rate cuts in the U.S., which can have the effect of a handbrake on risk assets such as crypto.  The rally in GameStop (GME) stock has prompted a surge in meme coins PEPE, FLOKI and MOG. A post on X by retail trader @TheRoaringKitty, who was at the center of the GME short squeeze in 2021, sent the video-game retailer's stock flying on Monday, triggering a rally in the major meme tokens. PEPE, FLOKI and MOG all jumped as much as 30% in the last 24 hours, suggesting traders may be preempting a repeat of the DOGE rally in 2021 which occurred following GME's surge. ""Roaring Kitty's return was perceived as bullish for meme coins because the market remembered that much of the GameStop mania of 2021 spilled over to $DOGE and other meme coins,” MOG token developer Shisui told CoinDesk in a message.  Coinbase (COIN) suffered a three-hour outage from 04:15 UTC on Tuesday, returning to use at 07:42, according to its status page. Website visitors had received a ""503 Service Temporarily Unavailable"" message beforehand. While the outage has been tackled, Coinbase noted that some users may still experience failure when sending crypto or withdrawing fiat. COIN shares were down around 2.25% at $195 during mid-morning in Europe before the U.S. market opened. The bitcoin price appeared to be unaffected. Coinbase had noted that ""Your funds are safe,"" in a post on X during the outage, and did not disclose anything further on the nature of the problem.  Chart of the Day  The table shows the top 10 trending words on crypto social media – Telegram, Reddit and X – in the past 24 hours.  At the top of the list are gme, gamestop, roaring and kitty, a sign that a 2021-like meme frenzy has gripped the market.  Shares in video game retailer GameStop (GME) surged Monday after Keith Gill, popularly known as Roaring Kitty, returned to social media with an image of a man sitting on a chair holding a gaming console.

Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev has been found guilty of money laundering by a Dutch judge at s-Hertogenbosch court on Tuesday. Pertsev has been given 64 months of prison time by the court.  The 31-year old Russian was escorted after the session by police to the cells under the court. This is where he will remain until the public prosecutor finds a prison in the Netherlands that is appropriate for his crimes.  ""Tornado Cash does not pose any barrier for people with criminal assets who want to launder them,"" according to the translated verdict seen by CoinDesk. ""That is why the court regards the defendant guilty of the money laundering activities as charged.""  Pertsev can appeal his sentence, which starts today. It does not appear that the time he spent behind bars between his arrest in August 2022 and Tuesday's verdict will count against the time he now has to spend in prison.  An indictment shared ahead of the trial said that between July 9, 2019 and Aug. 10, 2022, Pertsev made ""a habit of committing money laundering"" and that he should have at least suspected the criminal origins of illicit transactions on the Tornado Cash platform.  The developer was first jailed in the Netherlands in August 2022 after Tornado Cash was blacklisted by the U.S government. At the time, the U.S. Treasury had alleged that Tornado Cash was a key tool for the North Korean hacking group Lazarus. The Lazarus Group has been tied to a $625 million hack of Axie Infinity’s Ronin Network and other major crypto thefts.  The trial result could play in future trials of other Tornado Cash developers. Other developers of the crypto mixer, Roman Storm and Roman Semenov, also face allegations of money laundering and sanctions violations in the U.S. Storm will go to trial this September, but Semenov has not yet been arrested. Storm was arrested last year, after the U.S. again added Tornado Cash to its sanctions watchlist.  In the U.S., however, Storm is not accused of being responsible for the laundering of $1.2 billion due to differences in how U.S. and Dutch laws address personal responsibility in this type of alleged crime.

42418239,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcxsz,1715684630,"GameStop Rally Sends Meme Coins Skywards; PEPE, FLOKI, MOG Surge","Meme coins surged after a post by Keith Gill, a retail trader whose online persona and investment strategies contributed to the GameStop short squeeze in 2021.  The meme coin surge was not limited to microcap tokens but also impacted larger tokens like Pepe and Floki.  Top meme coins climbed higher Tuesday after a viral post by retail trader Keith Gill, whose cult following contributed to the GameStop short squeeze of 2021, sent some stocks and tokens flying at the start of the week.  Gill, who turned $58,000 into an estimated $50 million between 2019 and 2021 by buying GameStop (GME) options, sparked a run in the stock after posting from his @TheRoaringKitty X account for the first time in three years. A mere picture posted by Gill sent the stock skywards, nearly doubling in value on Monday despite multiple trading halts, even as Gill did not directly mention Gamestop.  GameSpot’s retail euphoria quickly spread to token markets. Several offshoots and joke tokens referring to GameStop, Gill, and his online kitten persona flooded Solana and Ethereum blockchains – with a meme GME token surging as much as 500%.  A video featuring the X-Men character Wolverine posted later on by Gill caused dozens of WOLVERINE tokens floated by opportunistic developers, most falling over 90% in the hours following.  The action was not limited to microcaps. Larger tokens Pepe (PEPE) and floki (FLOKI), and cat-themed tokens popcat (POPCAT) and mog (MOG) jumped as much as 30% in the past 24 hours, data shows. Such revival showed an early sign of risk appetite returning to the crypto markets following weeks of relatively lull trading action.  Gill’s post revived talks of a dogecoin (DOGE) rally among some traders, similar to its 2021, which occurred after GameStop’s run from $4 to $120 in a month.  “Roaring Kitty is living proof that retail can mog (outperform) institutions at the highest level,” MOG token developer Shisui told CoinDesk in a message. “His return was perceived as bullish for meme coins because the market remembered that much of the Gamestop mania of 2021 spilled over to $DOGE and other meme coins.”  “While we are far from being in a true risk-on environment, the price movements after Roaring Kitty’s comeback hint at which assets will outperform when frothy conditions return. The market has shown its hand, and it wants $MOG,” Shisui added.  Among developers and traders, part of Gill’s influential appeal isn’t only that he has made generational wealth: It’s the allure of a single trader taking down hedge funds from his bedroom using publicly available tools and the chance of them landing a similar move.  That has contributed to the general acceptance of meme tokens and made the sector a strong contender to DeFi and utility crypto projects compared to previous cycles, some opine.  “The industry is only just starting to come to grasp with memes being fun, relatable, enjoyable, and representative of the average person,” said B, lead developer at Floki, in a note to CoinDesk. “The vast majority of retail is flocking over to meme coins and ignoring the tired old ""utility"" crypto projects.”  “While many are worried about the ""lack of fundamentals surrounding meme coins"" and the implications of the continued attention they are getting for the space, the strong interest in meme coins was something I predicted years ago,” B said. He pointed out that Floki has now been focused on utility products to engage its audience that initially purchased the tokens as simply a meme.",POSITIVE,PEPE | FLOKI | MOG,MARKET | TRADING | PEPE | FLOKI | MOG,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/05/14/gamestop-rally-sends-meme-coins-skywards-pepe-floki-mog-surge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9cec511dc7142e3298608f2bdaa37966a00165c7-1262x710.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

27784524,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=607910,1715684402,CPI Preview: Bitcoin Price Poised To Surge If Projections Hold True,"The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, set to be released tomorrow, May 15 (Wednesday), at 8:30 am ET, is anticipated to be a potentially significant catalyst for the Bitcoin price. This expectation stems particularly from Bitcoin’s recent trend of responding to macroeconomic news, indicating a heightened sensitivity to such data in influencing its market dynamics. The CPI measures inflation by tracking changes in the price levels of a market basket of consumer goods and services. The upcoming report is of particular interest following three consecutive months where inflation data exceeded market expectations. Analysts currently project a slight moderation in inflation rates for April, which could have consequential implications for monetary policy and financial markets. CPI Preview: What To Expect For April, economists expect the CPI to show a year-on-year increase of 3.4%, a slight deceleration from March’s 3.5%. On a month-to-month basis, the increase is anticipated to slow to 0.3% compared to 0.4% previously. The core CPI, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and energy, is also expected to reflect a similar downtrend. The forecast suggests a drop from 3.8% to 3.6% on a year-on-year basis, marking the lowest annual core inflation rate since April 2021. Similarly, the monthly increase in core CPI is expected to decelerate to 0.3% from the previous month’s 0.4%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Be Set For New ATHs If It Breaks This Resistance: Analyst Goldman Sachs economists anticipate that the core CPI will continue to show disinflationary trends in the coming months, forecasting monthly core CPI inflation to hover between 0.25% and 0.30% before decreasing to about 0.2% by the end of 2024. The year-over-year core CPI is projected to stabilize at 3.5%, and core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation, another key indicator watched by the Federal Reserve, is expected at 2.7% by December 2024. The CPI data typically plays a significant role in influencing market dynamics, more so than the Producer Price Index (PPI). However, the real implications for financial markets will likely emerge once analysts review both the CPI and PPI reports. Notably, today (at 8:30 am ET) is a rare occasion where US PPI data is released the day prior to CPI data. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Bottom In? Analyst Reveals Key Price Levels To Watch “PPI + CPI data have a very strong correlation. PPI leading the way for CPI numbers historically. Thus expect the market to react more significantly than usual on any miss on expectations,” renowned crypto analyst Ted (@tedtalksmacro) warned today. Today is a rare occasion where US PPI data is released the day prior to CPI data. PPI + CPI data have a very strong correlation. PPI leading the way for CPI numbers historically. Thus expect the market to react more significantly than usual on any miss on expectations. https://t.co/BVlHuBMI1x pic.twitter.com/BCCpZac6ZW — ted (@tedtalksmacro) May 14, 2024 How Will Bitcoin React? The Bitcoin and crypto markets have shown notable sensitivity to inflation figures and the US Federal Reserve policy over the past months. Ted highlighted the importance of the upcoming inflation data, indicating that a slowdown in inflation could bolster risk assets like Bitcoin. He stated via X: Inflation data is centre-stage. Expect volatility, however, this is the first time in a little while where we are likely to see inflation data slow. That’ll be good for risk assets like Bitcoin if true and we could be on the verge of leg higher there. This sentiment is echoed by Alex Krüger (@krugermacro), who succinctly captured the market’s sentiment: “CPI in line or soft: higher, CPI hot: lower, BTC is back to trading macro news.” This perspective underscores the prevailing market theory that softer inflation could lead to more accommodative monetary policies, which are typically favorable for risk assets like Bitcoin.

Despite the growth in revenue and gross margin, WULF missed analyst expectations for $0.03 EPS and reported another quarterly net loss. With Bitcoin halving in the rearview mirror, TeraWulf is now talking about building out HPC services as a secondary revenue stream. When I last covered TeraWulf ( WULF ) in January of this year, I left readers with a thought about the setup for the company following the now-passed April block reward halving for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). Specifically, I hypothesized what the longer-term prospects could be for a middle-of-the-pack producer with no BTC stack to speak of: please keep in mind that without transaction fees remaining elevated, the economics of Bitcoin mining are difficult and potentially lead to consolidation. That could theoretically make WULF a target or merger candidate post-halving, but that's purely speculation on my part. I'm still of the view that TeraWulf is a potential acquisition target, given the company's market-leading efficiency metrics. That said, I do have a couple concerns. In this article, we'll look at the company's results for quarter-ended March, April production, and the company's HPC pilot. Q1 Results For the first quarter, TeraWulf grew revenue year over by over 260% from $11.5 million to $42.4 million. Quarterly revenue outpaced cost of revenue and the company reported a gross profit margin of 66% in Q1: Quarter ended March 2024 2023 YoY Revenue $42,433 $11,533 267.9% Cost of revenue $14,408 $5,002 188.0% Gross profit $28,025 $6,531 329.1% Profit Margin 66.05% 56.63% Source: TeraWulf 10-Q, dollars in thousands Despite tremendous growth in revenue and an improvement in gross profitability over the prior year, TeraWulf still reported an operating loss of $2.3 million in the quarter, with total opex nearly doubling from $15.7 million last year to over $30.3 million this year: Quarter ended March 2024 2023 YoY Operating expenses (including related party) $1,673 $905 84.9% SG&A (including related party) $14,909 $9,390 58.8% Depreciation $15,088 $5,433 177.7% Total Cost of Operations $30,341 $15,752 92.6% Source: TeraWulf 10-Q, dollars in thousands SG&A as a percentage of revenue continues to trend lower, but TeraWulf's depreciation expense increased year over year by 178%. All of this is before factoring in the interest payments on TeraWulf's debt, which was over $11 million in the quarter. Bottom line, analysts were expecting earnings per share of 3 cents and the company reported yet another EPS loss - this time ($0.03). This quarterly net loss is notable because this was the last quarter entirely representing pre-halving production. It's only going to get more challenging for TeraWulf to be profitable from here. At the end of the quarter, TeraWulf still had $60.2 million in net debt given $45.8 million in cash and $106 million in principal remaining - though the company did disclose a pre-payment of $30 million in April. Looking Ahead Author's chart (Company Filings) TeraWulf's production trend is one of the better ones in the public markets, certainly when judging against similarly sized peers in what I'd call the second mining tier after the top producers. WULF is one of about a handful of mining companies that grew BTC production in April year over year. This was in spite of the block reward halving occurring during the month and mainly attributable to EH/s expansion. 3m Block Fees (Mempool.space) Following Bitcoin's block reward halving on April 20th there was a temporary surge in transaction fees due to the launch of the Runes project at the halving block. This surge in fees lasted about three days and in the time since, we've seen those fees normalize back down to previous levels. If the trend of low fees continues, miners will see typical blocks produce a very small premium over the 3.125 BTC subsidy. Data by YCharts In addition to the subsidy declining, the price of BTC has stagnated in recent weeks. In response to each of these factors, we've seen global hash rate start to come back down from the pre-halving peak while still being well ahead of year to date lows. Assuming global hash rate doesn't completely collapse, many Bitcoin miners have some decisions to make; continue trying to scale an operation, pivot to a new business line, or attempt to sellout to a peer through a merger or acquisition. Author's chart/calculations (Company Filings) I've been of the view that even in spite of the large debt load, TeraWulf is somewhat well positioned as a buyout candidate for a larger competitor with capital due to its high mining efficiency marks compared to peers. At 44.6 EH/s, TeraWulf was again the most efficient mining fleet in the public markets during the month of April. That said, I'm less convinced of the buyout prospects following this Q1 report. Q2-23 Q3-23 Q4-23 Q1-24 TTM Cost of Revenues $5,100,000 $8,300,000 $8,900,000 $14,400,000 $36,700,000 Total Opex $16,200,000 $20,000,000 $18,200,000 $30,341,000 $84,741,000 BTC Mined 909 989 971 1,056 3,925 Breakeven Price $23,432 $28,615 $27,909 $42,368 $30,940 Source: Author's breakeven estimate before interest payments on debt Not only do I see a new quarterly breakeven price for WULF that would exceed current BTC rates when accounting for cost of revenue and total opex post-halving, but management appears poised to start putting capital into HPC services to power generative AI solutions: May Investor Deck (TeraWulf) By my count, TeraWulf is at least the sixth public Bitcoin miner that is now openly discussing high performance compute as an alternative revenue stream to Bitcoin mining. To be clear, GPU-based HPC services make a lot more sense for a company like HIVE Digital Technologies ( HIVE ) because such a large portion of that company's pre-Merge revenue came from mining Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) with GPUs. Generative AI typically requires very expensive GPUs rather than ASICs. The point is, WULF shareholders can likely expect either more debt or more dilution if the company goes through with proposed HPC datacenter plans following this pilot program. Final Thoughts Data by YCharts TeraWulf remains one of the most efficient mining companies in the public markets. At 7.8 EH/s in April, TeraWulf is one of the production leaders in the second tier of public Bitcoin miners. Given the combination of efficiency and EH/s, I still think WULF is a buyout target at the right price. However, at current valuation levels, we may need to see WULF shares back under $2 before a peer with enough capital to do a deal would be interested. Again, this is all purely speculation on my part. But I like TeraWulf a lot more as a possible Bitcoin mining merger target than as yet another HPC data center provider.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4692987-terawulf-q1-earnings-not-a-great-quarter?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/27784537.jpeg

42418230,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcxkj,1715682875,Bitcoin Market Activity Suggests Looming U.S. Inflation Data May Be Non-Event,"Bitcoin's options market is pricing for negligible volatility after Wednesday's U.S. consumer inflation release.  The CPI is expected to offer relief after a string of upside surprises that dented Fed interest-rate cut hopes.  Tomorrow's U.S. inflation report will take center stage as investors look for guidance on the Federal Reserve's path for interest rates after a series of recent surprises dented expectations of rate cuts.  Still, the pricing of bitcoin options – which can offer protection against swings in the asset's price – suggests traders do not foresee a volatility explosion following the release.  Traders often buy options that capture specific events, pushing their implied volatility higher relative to shorter- and longer-term contracts. Analysts look at the difference between implied volatility for options expiring before and after an event to understand how much extra volatility the market is pricing.  ""The market is pricing a premium of only 1.5 vols for the event ... almost negligible,"" institutional liquidity provider OrBit Markets, one of the top altcoin market makers on Deribit, told CoinDesk. In other words, prices may move less than 2% on either side following the CPI report, exhibiting hardly any additional volatility. S&P 500 options are pricing in relatively higher volatility for the release, OrBit said.  The U.S. Labor Department will publish the consumer price index (CPI) data for April 12:30 UTC. It is forecast to show the cost of living increased by 3.4% year-on-year, a moderation from March's 3.5%. Core CPI, which strips out the volatile food and energy component, probably rose 3.6% year-on-year, down from March's 3.8%, according to estimates published by Bloomberg.  Options offer buyers insurance against bullish or bearish price moves. A call option protects against price rallies, while a put protects from price slides. Implied volatility refers to expectations for price turbulence over a specific period.  Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, considered bitcoin options expiring later in the week. His analysis agrees with OrBit's.  ""Implied volatility at 52.8% for options expiring on May 17 is just 2% higher than other options, which means traders expect a moderate pick up in volatility post-CPI. However, realized [historical] volatility remains below 50%, meaning expectations for an outsized move either up or down are not priced in,"" Thielen told CoinDesk.  CPI to signal moderation  Fed funds futures currently assign just a 5% probability of a rate cut in June, with the number rising notably into September.  Some analysts expect a potential soft CPI print to bulk up the rate cut probability, sending bitcoin past $65,000, the upper end of the its recent trading range.  Others are more cautious. Inflation, for example, is only one of the inputs considered by policy makers.  ""Some signs of slower price growth (if materialized) would be welcomed by Fed officials, but the details of earlier price increases have been concerning. It will take more than one softer price report to calm inflation fears,"" economists at RBC said in a weekly note.  ""Our view is that inflation pressures will ease over the second half of this year, but that is contingent on economic growth slowing and unemployment edging higher. We expect the Fed will stick to a wait-and-see approach over the summer while watching the data closely. We think the Fed will move to cut interest rates in December if domestic demand and inflation readings gradually move lower over the remainder of this year.""",NEUTRAL,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/05/14/bitcoin-market-activity-suggests-looming-us-inflation-data-may-be-non-event,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ce30c5f668be3eaaf3a49a27f10943739c69a19b-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

MicroStrategy offers a solid entry point for Bitcoin bulls, but those uncomfortable with high volatility should consider alternative options like Bitcoin ETFs. MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) is a difficult company to value. Its legacy software business is declining, and the company has gone all-in Bitcoin since 2020. Perhaps not surprisingly, the market has had a tough time trying to value MicroStrategy in the past, with a very high volatility in its stock. In this article, I will explain what I think about MicroStrategy valuation, its role in a portfolio and who should or should not enter a position at its current price. Nobody seems to agree on MSTR (Seeking Alpha) Thesis: the market will continue struggling with MSTR, yet this remains a solid entry point for those who can handle volatility MicroStrategy is essentially a leveraged bet on Bitcoin, but with an added layer of complexity: the market has never fully understood why or to what extent MSTR should trade at a premium (or discount) relative to Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). Historically, MicroStrategy has traded with a premium (or discount) ranging between 0.50x and more than 3x relative to its Bitcoin holdings. The premium has turned into a discount during Bitcoin bear runs and has always been positive during Bitcoin bull runs. The premium at the time of writing, at 1.60x, is in the top 30% historically for the past 4 years, but it is significantly lower than the last Bitcoin bull run. For Bitcoin bulls, MicroStrategy at its current price offers a solid entry point. However, if you're not comfortable with high volatility, opting for a Bitcoin ETF is a better choice. I anticipate continued volatility and expect the market to struggle with accurately valuing MicroStrategy. MicroStrategy: a Bitcoin development company Recent articles on Seeking Alpha describe MicroStrategy as a lousy software business that invests in Bitcoin. In my view, the value of MicroStrategy's legacy software business is negligible in the context of its valuation. I see MicroStrategy's software as nothing more than a legacy business. As of 2023 , it generates revenue of less than half a billion dollars (declining 6% year-on-year), with a gross profit of $96 million. Even assuming a generous valuation, this business could be worth $1 to $2 Billion at most. This compares to a market capitalization for MSTR of around $22 Billion at the time of writing. MicroStrategy is marketing itself as the first Bitcoin Development Company, and it is exclusively a Bitcoin company. I would not be surprised if Michael Saylor eventually ends up selling its software business, as he has already resigned as CEO of the company to focus on its Bitcoin bet. Because of these reasons, I will not include MicroStrategy's software business in my analysis. I believe the market also considers this segment negligible and assumes it will either be sold or become insignificant if the company's Bitcoin investment succeeds. Understanding MicroStrategy's Bitcoin strategy and its role in a portfolio Detractors of MicroStrategy might believe that the company is simply an inefficient, highly volatile way to get exposed to Bitcoin. In my opinion, this simplistic view misses MicroStrategy's vision related to its Bitcoin per share. BTC per Share, MSTR (mstr-tracker.com) MicroStrategy is deliberately buying more Bitcoin to boost its Bitcoin per share ratio, currently at 0.012. In this context, the fact that MicroStrategy's shares outstanding are increasing every year is not a concern. The company isn't truly diluting its investors; rather, it's using the funds raised to purchase more Bitcoin, increasing BTC per share. I believe that BTC per Share, in the case of MicroStrategy, is a better indicator than traditional metrics such as Earnings per share. That's because the company is positioning itself as an alternative to Bitcoin ETFs , and effectively a leveraged bet on Bitcoin itself. Buying a share of MicroStrategy today means acquiring not just 0.012 Bitcoin, but also the reasonable expectation that your Bitcoin per share will continue to increase. If you view Bitcoin as the scarcest asset on Earth and are bullish on its long-term value, the prospect of owning an ever-increasing amount of this scarce asset can be highly attractive. Investing in a Bitcoin ETF, such as the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), presents a very different scenario. When you buy shares of IBIT, the number of Bitcoin represented by your investment will not increase over time. If anything, your holdings will gradually decrease due to the 0.25% expense ratio charged by BlackRock. This dynamic is effectively what the market is discounting, and part of the reason behind MicroStrategy's premium compared to its mere Bitcoin holdings. Understanding the MicroStrategy premium and high volatility MicroStrategy has always traded at significant premium or discount to its Bitcoin holdings. Historically, the company trades at a hefty premium during bull runs and at a deep discount during bear runs. MSTR Premium vs. BTC (mstr-tracker.com) I believe euphoria plays a role in this market dynamic. Markets tend to overestimate future returns in bull markets, while they tend to be overly pessimistic in bear markets. There is irrationality on both sides. However, I also believe that a large part of this premium is justified, and it has to do with MicroStrategy's Bitcoin per share strategy, which I covered in the previous section. MSTR Premium vs. BTC, 2020 to date (mstr-tracker.com) Looking at MSTR in its recent past - from late 2020 to today - the company is currently trading at a 1.6x premium that is significantly below its peaks. The stock consistently traded at a premium above 1.6x for 2020 and the first half of 2021, with peaks at 3x and briefly at 6x. During most of the bear market in late 2021 and 2022, on the other hand, MicroStrategy has traded at a discount compared to its Bitcoin holdings. While the market seems to really be struggling to place a valuation on MSTR, I have no reason to believe this should not continue to be the case for the foreseeable future. If Bitcoin were to experience a continued bull run from its current levels, I can see MicroStrategy stock trading at a significant premium, possibly reaching the same levels it experienced in 2020 and 2021. Short squeeze and stock split MicroStrategy has a significant short interest, currently at roughly 20% . This is another factor that can determine a quick rise in MSFT's premium, should a short squeeze take place as a result of a rise in Bitcoin's prices. However, I personally believe that the high share price - over $1,200 at the time of writing - acts as a barrier to retail investors, potentially limiting the likelihood of a short squeeze. The high cost per share may deter retail investors from buying in. I think MicroStrategy could benefit from (and should consider) a stock split. Such a move would lower the price per share, potentially increasing retail participation. It could also enhance MicroStrategy's position as an alternative to a Bitcoin ETF, making it more accessible and appealing to a broader base of investors. Risks to my thesis and alternatives to get exposure to Bitcoin The most obvious risk to my thesis is that MicroStrategy might stop being valued at a significant premium relative to its Bitcoin holdings. There's a possibility that the company may not be able to continue increasing its BTC per share in the future, and the market may adjust by lowering its premium accordingly. Investors should also be mindful of volatility before investing in MicroStrategy. This stock has experienced high volatility, and I anticipate this will continue in the foreseeable future. Markets can behave irrationally in the short term, whether Bitcoin's price rises or falls from its current levels. An alternative, less volatile way to get exposed to Bitcoin is simply to buy one of the recently launched ETFs. I have recently compared them in an article on Seeking Alpha. The last risk worth mentioning is that related to Bitcoin itself. Bitcoin remains a highly volatile asset, with an unclear role as a possible store of value. Conclusion In this article, I have intentionally avoided discussing the bull or bear case for Bitcoin. Instead, I focused on whether MicroStrategy serves as a sensible option for gaining exposure to Bitcoin. My final recommendation is for investors willing to make a leveraged bet on Bitcoin to consider buying MSTR at its current prices. I do expect this stock to continue trading at a premium relative to its Bitcoin holdings, should a Bitcoin bull run take place in the future. For those who are bullish on Bitcoin but prefer a less risky approach, due to the inherent volatility and risk associated with such an asset, it's advisable to avoid this stock. Instead, they should consider gaining exposure to Bitcoin through one of the recently approved ETFs.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4692993-microstrategy-buy-if-you-can-stomach-high-volatility?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/27782748.jpeg

42408267,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaBoHS,1715678415,Bitcoin Runes Protocol Sees Traction Waning After Much-Hyped Introduction,"The Bitcoin Runes protocol experienced a significant decrease in activity and fee revenue after its initial surge after the Bitcoin halving.  Runes takes the Ordinals protocol a step further by making transactions cheaper and faster, but has failed to maintain meaningful traction among users.  Despite the initial excitement, the protocol's momentum has slowed, and its impact on the Bitcoin ecosystem remains to be seen.  Activity on the Bitcoin Runes protocol has slowed over the past week, a sign it has failed to generate meaningful traction among users despite a stellar start last month.  Runes takes the Ordinals protocol a step further by making transactions even cheaper and faster. Ordinals are a way to embed data into the Bitcoin blockchain by inscribing references to digital art into small Bitcoin-based transactions.  The much-hyped Runes went live after Bitcoin’s fourth halving on April 20. Data tracked on Dune Analytics shows that in its first 10 days the protocol racked up more than 85,000 token issuances and generated over $3 million in fees.  In the past two weeks, however, all the metrics – including fees, new Runes and user activity – have dropped more than 50%. Only some 5,000 new Runes have been issued since May 1, generating just under $100,000 in fees.  At its peak, Runes led transactions and fees in the broader Bitcoin ecosystem, accounting for as much as 80% of all network activity. Now it's 20%. Worth noting, however, is that the downturn came amid a general market decline marked by falling bitcoin {{BTC}} prices and slow growth in alternative tokens, which may have contributed to a drop in sentiment for novel technology.  Built for memes and ‘degens’  Runes generated massive interest on social platform X before its launch with creator Casey Rodamor aiming to make it a protocol ripe for meme coin trading and “degen” traders. Some industry participants expected the protocol to mirror the flourishing meme coin ecosystem on blockchains such as Solana and Base – likely fueling interest and bets on little-known memes.  PUPS, a Runes token, emerged as a big play and surged from under $10 million capitalization to over $150 million in under a week, gaining support from several noted traders such as BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes.  Several NFT collections and tokens were launched on Ordinals, and even on Ethereum, before the protocol's introduction – each aiming to transfer over and become the biggest compilation after the launch. Such activity made Bitcoin-based NFTs top other collections on the usual leaders Ethereum and Solana, with tens of millions exchanging hands in an otherwise scant market for non-fungible tokens.  Some skeptics say that while Runes may serve as a way to build the Bitcoin ecosystem, there’s still work to be done.  ""The success of the Bitcoin L2 project based on OP_Return is doubtful as UTXO based blockchain network is fundamentally different from smart contract based network,"" Ho Chan Chung, head of marketing at CryptoQuant, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. ""The current notion of Bitcoin narrative as a digital currency combined, and the difference in the blockchain network fundamental are the two big hurdles that Bitcoin L2 projects need to overcome.""  ""Lightning network was able to prove it. However, Ordinals, BRC-20, and Runes all seemed to fail at winning the narrative for now.""

Bitcoin fell by 3% over the last week, while TON increased by nearly 20%. Within the cryptocurrency world, this unexpected outperformance has set off a wild speculating frenzy. Will TON’s rapid ascent continue, or is this merely a passing blip? Related Reading: CEO Drops Bombshell: Trump Campaign Eyes Crypto-Friendly Policies Social Buzz Fuels The Toncoin Engine One key factor behind TON’s recent success appears to be a surge in social media activity. Social volume, a metric that tracks discussions and mentions on platforms like Twitter and Telegram, has skyrocketed by over 20% compared to the previous week. This suggests a growing interest in TON, potentially attracting new investors and driving up the price. 📉 With #bearish sentiment high, #crypto markets have continued to slip over the past week. Overall, the market has dropped -3.6%, and volume is -27% lower than the previous week. $TON, $KAS, $RUNE, and $AKT have kept traders hopeful. https://t.co/E6b2DtmAxI pic.twitter.com/VoiCJk1ymh — Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 13, 2024 Investor Sentiment: A Mixed Bag For TON However, a closer look reveals a potential wrinkle in this optimistic outlook. While the overall sentiment surrounding TON has been positive, it has recently dipped into negative territory. This could be a sign of growing investor apprehension, as some may be worried about the sustainability of the current price rally. Accumulation Signals: Are Investors Betting Big On Toncoin? On the other hand, some metrics point towards potential long-term bullishness. The mean dollar invested age, an indicator of how long tokens have been held, has been gradually increasing. This suggests that investors are holding onto their TON, potentially with an eye on future gains. Additionally, the dormant circulation, representing tokens that haven’t been moved in a while, has remained low. While a previous spike coincided with a price peak, the current stability could indicate a more strategic accumulation by investors. Technical Analysis: Eyes On The Prize For Toncoin Technical analysts, who study price charts and historical data to predict future movements, are also cautiously optimistic about TON. Fibonacci retracement levels, a popular technical tool, suggest the recent downtrend may be nearing its end. This could pave the way for TON to climb towards targets near $10, with potential profit-taking opportunities for investors. Related Reading: Investment Firm Makes Bitcoin Its Strategic Reserve – Impact On Price A Marathon, Not A Sprint While the recent surge in price and social media buzz paints a promising picture for TON, it’s crucial to remember that the cryptocurrency market remains highly volatile. The current uptrend for TON could be the beginning of a long-term ascent, fueled by growing adoption and a thriving ecosystem within the Telegram network. However, it’s also possible that this is just a short-lived rally, followed by a correction.

27777499,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=607886,1715673627,No Ties To OpenAI: Worldcoin Drops 9% As Top Trader Issues Warning,"Worldcoin (WLD) has seen its value plummet by nearly 9% in just 24 hours, with the price settling at around $5.20. This decline aligns with a critical analysis issued by DeFi^2 (@DefiSquared), the current top trader on the crypt exchange Bybit, who has raised concerns about the potential for substantial inflationary pressures and misleading marketing associated with Worldcoin. Notably, the WLD plunge comes just after OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, announced on Monday its plans to unveil a cutting-edge AI model named GPT-4o. This advanced model boasts the ability to engage in lifelike voice conversations and seamlessly interact across text and images. Worldcoin is usually a beneficiary of OpenAI announcements, but this time WLD price plunged. Why Worldcoin Is Plummeting In his analysis shared on X, DeFi^2 expounded on the mechanics behind the rapid devaluation of Worldcoin, emphasizing that the token is suffering from significant daily depreciation due to both emissions and strategic sales maneuvers by the Worldcoin Foundation. Specifically, the token’s value is deteriorating at a rate of 0.6% each day, driven by the emissions related to grant and operator claims. These tokens, as per DeFi^2’s observation of on-chain analytics, are predominantly sold off almost immediately upon issuance, adding to the downward pressure on Worldcoin’s price. Related Reading: Brace For Impact: Worldcoin Team Plans To Sell 1.5 Million WLD Tokens Every Week For 6 Months Adding to the supply concerns, the Worldcoin Foundation recently declared its intention to offload $200 million worth of Worldcoin to trading firms. This move will effectively increase the circulating supply by an additional 18%. DeFi^2 criticized this decision, pointing out that the tokens, misleadingly attributed to a “Community” allocation, are being sold at a discount to entities that may not prioritize the broader community’s interests, potentially diluting the value for existing holders. The most critical issue highlighted by DeFi^2, however, pertains to the near future, when unlocks for venture capital and team-related tokens are set to begin. He forecasts that in just 70 days, the supply of Worldcoin will start to inflate at an alarming rate of 4% per day due to these unlocks combined with ongoing emissions. This scenario could unleash nearly $50 million worth of sell pressure daily, profoundly impacting the token’s market price and stability. DeFi^2’s analysis did not shy away from addressing the perceived misconceptions surrounding Worldcoin’s affiliation with notable tech personalities and organizations. He clarified that Sam Altman, known for his role with OpenAI, has no active involvement with Worldcoin, which operates as a completely separate entity. This point addresses a common misconception that potentially misled investors about the nature and backing of the token. Related Reading: Worldcoin Faces $1.2 Million Fine In Argentina For Law Violations; WLD’s Price Reacts Moreover, DeFi^2 drew parallels between Worldcoin’s tokenomics and what he describes as “predatory” economic models that are engineered to disproportionately benefit early investors and insiders at the expense of general retail investors. He noted that similar strategies had been used in the past in the crypto industry, where the manipulation of token supply and market conditions facilitated significant gains for insiders while leaving regular investors exposed to heightened risks and losses. “Worldcoin realistically might become the greatest transfer of wealth of this entire cycle. Unfortunately, this wealth transfer isn’t in the form of universal basic income as their mission suggests, but instead to the pockets of the team and insiders,” DeFi^2 stated. He added that “the manipulative low float / high FDV design is straight out of the SBF playbook, and directly enriches insiders as they hedge their locked allocations at high valuations pre-unlock via perps / OTC; yet retail somehow sadly still think they’re beating the system trying to push the price up.” As the crypto community digests DeFi^2’s stark warnings, the immediate reaction has been a surge in trading activity to $666 million (up 104% in the last 24 hours), with investors and speculators likely reassessing their positions in Worldcoin in light of these revelations. At press time, WLD traded at $5.24.

Regardless of who is elected, crypto policy should still continue developing as it has been, said Adam Jackson, director of policy at Innovate Finance.  A U.K. election is not going to derail the progress the country has made when it comes to regulating the crypto sector, industry stakeholders told CoinDesk.  An election date has not been announced yet, but it is expected to happen in the country this year. The ruling Conservative party – which has been in government for nearly 14 years, since it was first elected in May 2010 – has ushered in a sweep of crypto measures. The party set out to make the country a crypto hub in 2022 and has since introduced a markets bill to enable crypto to be regulated as a financial activity by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).  Now the Conservatives have promised to put in place legislation for stablecoins and staking in the coming weeks – before the next election. Many believe that is a realistic goal.  The country needs secondary legislation that formally tasks the FCA with regulating crypto, including stablecoins, said Adam Jackson, director of policy at Innovate Finance, in an interview.  ""That's what the government said they would do,"" Jackson said. ""We haven't heard otherwise as to why that's not feasible. So all things being equal they should have those powers by the time of the national election.""  Laura Navaratnam, U.K. policy lead at the Crypto Council for Innovation, agreed that the Conservative government at the moment is ""definitely"" on track adding that even the country's regulators – the Bank of England and the FCA – have been moving forward by publishing discussion papers on stablecoins.  ""There is always the risk with any level of political turbulence that some of that stuff could slow down,"" Navaratnam told CoinDesk in an interview.  Read more: UK Minister Says Government Only Has Time to Implement Stablecoin, Staking Legislation  Labour  The Conservatives may have a couple of months left before an election is announced, but once it is they will have to go head to head with their opposition party and could lose power. The current favorite to win is the Labour party, according to an Ipsos poll that surveyed over 1,000 people in April. The poll shows that 44% of voters intend to vote Labour while only 19% intend to vote for the Conservatives.  The U.K. recently hosted a local election which showed a large swing towards the Labour party and marked major losses for the Conservatives. Labour managed to attain 1,158 local councilor seats and gained 186 whereas the Conservatives only attained 515, and lost 474, falling behind the Liberal Democrat party also, BBC data showed.  Read more: UK Local Elections Show Swing to Labour With General Election Pending  The size of the majority in an election matters, Jackson said.  ""I think for any party, the smaller the majority, the more they will be constrained in what they do in some of these areas,"" Jackson said.  Labour so far has indicated that it wants to make the U.K. a securities tokenization hub in its plan for the financial sector. Tokenization is the process of creating a digital representation of a real thing including financial assets. A tokenization regime is something that people in the country have been calling out for.  ""We’re pleased to see that Labour have committed to helping turn the U.K. into a global hub for digital tokenization as part of the party’s policies for the financial services sector,"" CryptoUK said in February.  However, Labour did not say much about how it plans to regulate crypto.  ""So I think the question we have is, you know, what's the Labour approach on that? It's not a question that they can ignore,"" Jackson said.  Labour said in its report that this was only the ""first stage in outlining Labour’s vision for the future of Britain’s financial services,"" indicating more information may come.  ""I think there's a long time between now and an election and so I wouldn't expect them to further the details out at this point,"" said Varun Paul, senior director and business lead for CBDC and financial market infrastructure at Fireblocks. ""I'm pleased – I don't think that digital assets are proving to be a political hot potato at the moment, I think we're lucky in the U.K. that it's not become a political battleground like it has been in the U.S.""  Some lawmakers in the U.S. have been calling for a central bank digital currency to be banned while others want the country to conduct a CBDC pilot. Meanwhile, across the pond, Labour indicated that it intends to support the Bank of Englands' digital pound work in its report.  ""We should see quite a stable approach to financial services, regulation and things going in the same direction,"" Jackson said.

There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $13.50 on the 4-hour chart of the LINK/USD pair. The next major resistance is near the $13.80 zone. A clear break above $13.80 may possibly start a steady increase toward the $14.00 level. The next major resistance is near the $14.35 level, above which the price could test $15.50. More Losses? If Chainlink’s price fails to climb above the $13.50 resistance level, there could be a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $13.10 level. The next major support is near the $12.80 level, below which the price might test the $12.20 level. Any more losses could lead LINK toward the $11.50 level in the near term. Technical Indicators 4 hours MACD – The MACD for LINK/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone. 4 hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for LINK/USD is now below the 50 level.

The pilot will assess the benefits of the stablecoin in “real-world applications.”  Philippines’ central bank has given its approval to digital currency exchange Coins.ph to pilot a Philippine Peso-backed stablecoin called PHPC, the company said last week.  The program will come under the BSP’s Regulatory Sandbox Framework and will be backed by Coins.ph’ cash and cash equivalents held in Philippine bank accounts, the announcement said. The pilot will assess the benefits of the stablecoin in “real-world applications while monitoring its impact on the existing financial ecosystem.”  Coins.ph chief executive officer Wei Zhou, who was previously Binance’s Chief Financial Officer, told a press briefing that it got the go-ahead to publicly test the stablecoin in April and plans to make it available on its platform by early June, local reports said.  Zhou said that the performance of the pilot will be monitored, and if certain metrics are hit, they anticipate obtaining full approval, allowing them to “leave the sandbox.”  The Philippines has recently blocked Binance from operating in the nation and said that it would issue a wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC) within two years while avoiding a retail CBDC. Digital payments firm Strike has also expanded its global money transfer service to the nation, where the $12 billion remittance market is one of the world’s largest.

The inaugral trade between QCP Capital and Galaxy Digital involved MATIC call options expiring on May 31.  Crypto over-the-counter liquidity network Paradigm announced on Monday a block trading facility on leading derivatives exchange Deribit for options tied to prominent alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins), MATIC, SOL, and XRP.  “Clients can now execute block trades in Polygon (MATIC), Solana (SOL), and Ripple (XRP),” Paradigm said on X, adding that the linear options will offer payouts that ""directly correlate with the price movements of the underlying asset.”  Options are derivative contracts that give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset by a specific date (expiration date) at a predetermined price. A call option gives the right to buy, and a put option offers the right to sell.  Block trades are privately negotiated futures, options, or combination trades exceeding certain volume thresholds. Participants typically use communication technologies like Paradigm to request quotes bilaterally and agree on the price, following which the trade is submitted to an exchange, in this case, Deribit, for execution and clearing.  Block trades reduce slippage or costs associated with executing transactions and ensure a minimal impact on the going market price.  Since its inception in 2016, Paradigm’s OTC network has been a preferred venue for institutional investors to take block trades. The platform has registered nearly $400 billion in volume to date and, as of May, accounts for 17% of the cumulative bitcoin and ether options activity on Deribit.  Paradigm’s new offering has already found takers. On Monday, the platform announced the successful completion of an inaugural trade involving 500,000 units of MATIC call spreads between Singapore-based QCP Capital and Galaxy Digital.  The trade involved MATIC call options at strikes 80 cents and 95 cents, expiring on May 31. Paradigm facilitated the trade, which was printed on Deribit. MATIC is the native cryptocurrency of the Polygon Network, used for staking and to pay gas fees.  ""We are thrilled to see Paradigm expand its block trading services to include linear altcoin options, starting with the pioneering transaction in MATIC options on our platform. This expansion not only broadens our mutual offering but also sets the stage for upcoming inaugural blocks in SOL and XRP,"" Luuk Strijers, chief executive officer at Deribit, said.",POSITIVE,MATIC | SOL | XRP,ALTCOIN | MATIC | SOL | TRADING | XRP,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/05/14/paradigm-unveils-block-trading-facility-for-matic-sol-xrp-options,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9fca3be1e826c5577e40df8eaccad931bb08d80f-1280x853.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42408251,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaBnTr,1715663386,Indian Crypto Exchange CoinDCX’s DeFi Arm Okto to Launch Blockchain and OKTO Token,"CoinDCX has expanded the Okto wallet into an Okto ecosystem to give users a single-click mobile experience in Web3.  A points program has been launched and a blockchain and the $OKTO token to power that chain will come later this year.  Indian crypto exchange CoinDCX has expanded what started as the Okto wallet into an Okto ecosystem, which will include launching a blockchain, a token, and a points program starting Tuesday.  The aim is to give global users a single-click mobile experience while traversing the Web3 space, its co-founders Neeraj Khandelwal and Sumit Gupta told CoinDesk in an interview.  The objective of Okto’s points program is to bootstrap the launch of the Okto blockchain, which will happen later in 2024. That’s also when the launch of the OKTO token to power that chain will occur. The points program will reward users for their on-chain transactions, and those trading elsewhere can earn bonus points by moving assets to the Okto Wallet. As much as 7% of the OKTO token will be air-dropped to early users.  CoinDCX launched Okto in August 2022 as a DeFi mobile app with an inbuilt wallet aimed at easing the transition of crypto consumers to DeFi. Since then, it has spent nearly two years testing ways to solve the problem of a broken user experience to engage the next billion Web3 users.  “Self-custody wallet experience was completely broken and required users to go through several hurdles of the Web3 space like blockchain, self-custody, security and trust, signing transactions or gas fees,"" said Khandelwal. “Okto is the first such system which provides a Web 2-like single click mobile experience in the Web3.""  The idea of creating a native experience was made possible in phases by first, working on a solution internally to streamline the process of using DeFi's various elements.  In phase two, the solution was packaged into a software development kit (SDK), which is a bundle of software development tools, and made available to external entities in a centralized scenario. This allowed developers to build applications without needing to understand the intricacies of each blockchain.  “Post experiencing the challenges of building a full chain abstracted Okto wallet, in Phase 2, we introduced the Okto Web3 SDK, an industry-first embedded wallet enabling any app or internet company to fully harness the potential of Web3,"" Khandelwal said. ”We are now in the process of building an entire Okto Ecosystem.""  ""We believed all CeFi platforms would eventually have a DeFi arm,"" said Sumit Gupta, co-founder of CoinDCX. “The Okto Chain will power thousands of applications being built in the Web3 space.""  More than 20 apps are being built through the SDK, 50+ chains and protocols have been integrated, and over a million wallets have been created on what they call the ""Okto Orchestration Layer.”  “We are not just targeting one partner or ecosystem but hope to land several partnerships to help us make this globally ubiquitous,” Khandelwal said without naming any specific entity.

27768065,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=607818,1715659213,Bitcoin Will Be Set For New ATHs If It Breaks This Resistance: Analyst,"An analyst has explained how Bitcoin could be positioned for new all-time highs (ATHs) if it can break through this on-chain resistance level. Bitcoin On-Chain Data Could Suggest This Level Holds Major Resistance In a new post on X, analyst Ali discussed Bitcoin’s current on-chain resistance. In on-chain analysis, the strength of support and resistance levels is based on the total amount of cryptocurrency last acquired at each level. Below is a chart for Glassnode’s UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) metric, which shows the supply distribution across the various price levels based on where the investors bought their coins. From the graph, it’s visible that in terms of the levels currently ahead of the spot price, the $66,250 mark stands out as it hosts the cost basis of over 2% of all Bitcoin UTXOs. Generally, the cost basis is a special level for any investor, and they are naturally more likely to react when it is retested, as it can lead to a flip in their profit-loss situation. The spot price retesting a level won’t produce much reaction if only a few investors share their cost basis around the level. Still, if many holders bought there, the cryptocurrency could see visible effects upon a retest. Investors who are losing money may look forward to such a retest to exit out at their break-even point, as they may fear that the asset will fall back down again in the future, so getting away with their initial capital would seem like the ideal decision. As such, a retest of a level dense with UTXOs from below can lead to a selling reaction in the market, making these levels points of strong resistance for Bitcoin. Since the $66,250 level appears to be where the most coins were purchased out of the levels ahead, this level could be the toughest one to break for the cryptocurrency. On the brighter side, though, the levels after this point are relatively thin. “Once BTC breaks past this level, it will be positioned for new all-time highs!” explains the analyst. The market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has also discussed about on-chain cost basis distribution in an X post today. As revealed by the firm, around 10% of all addresses acquired their coins between the current spot price and the all-time high the asset set back in March. This would naturally mean that 10% of the total addresses, equivalent to 5.16 million, are in the red on the Bitcoin network. BTC Price Bitcoin has continued to move in its recent range, with its price currently trading around the $62,800 level.

27765733,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=607820,1715655634,Is The Crypto Winter Thawing? US Bitcoin ETFs Record First Inflows In Weeks – Coinshares,"After experiencing outflows for four consecutive weeks, US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have marked a notable shift in momentum, witnessing net inflows once again. According to recent data from CoinShares, digital asset investment products have seen inflows totaling $130 million for the first time in five weeks. This change suggests renewed investor interest in crypto-focused investment products, particularly in the United States, where most of these inflows, totaling over $130 million, occurred. Related Reading: Analyst Points Out Level To Beat If Bitcoin Is To Reach $76,000 A Mixed Bag Of Global Investment Flows Grayscale, a major player in the digital asset space, reported a significant decrease in weekly outflows, recording its lowest since January at $171 million. This trend indicates a potential stabilization in the market after a period of volatility and declining interest. Meanwhile, interaction between US regulators and spot ETF issuers has remained minimal, particularly for spot Ethereum ETF applications. This lack of engagement has fuelled speculation that approval for these ETFs might not be approaching, as reflected by the amount of outflows from Ethereum-based products. James Butterfill, Head of Research at Coinshares, particularly noted: Low interaction by the US regulators with ETF issuer applications for a spot Ethereum ETF have increased speculation that the ETF approval is not imminent, this has been reflected in outflows which totalled US$14m last week. On a global scale, the investment landscape showed mixed signals. After a week of record inflows likely driven by “seed capital” post-Bitcoin ETF launches, as highlighted by Butterfill, Hong Kong saw a significant drop to $19 million in inflows. Conversely, Switzerland experienced inflows amounting to $14 million. Canada and Germany continued to see outflows, with their year-to-date figures reaching a combined $660 million, indicating sustained bearish sentiment in these markets. Bitcoin has rebounded with $144 million in inflows, counteracting a generally “weak month.” In contrast, short-Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) recorded outflows totaling $5.1 million, up to $18 million over the last eight weeks. These figures highlight the volatile dynamics within the crypto market, with Bitcoin currently showing stronger performance than Ethereum. Bitcoin And Ethereum Market Performance Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin surged nearly 3%, while Ethereum increased by only 1.2%. Despite these gains, both assets are down by 2.3% and 6% over the past week. Amidst these market movements, crypto analyst Ali provided insights into Bitcoin’s potential paths. According to Ali, Bitcoin could climb to $76,000 if it reclaims $64,290 as a support level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cash Price At Make-Or-Break Moment, Key Levels To Watch Failing to achieve this could see the flagship crypto drop to support at $51,970, based on Market Value To Realized Value (MVRV) extreme deviation pricing bands, identifying this figure as the all-time mean.

The retrace raised alarms for some crypto investors and market watchers, who feared the bull run had ended. Since then, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has recovered crucial levels, and analysts have identified bullish patterns on BTC’s chart, suggesting that it might finally be out of the woods. Related Reading: Analyst Points Out Level To Beat If Bitcoin Is To Reach $76,000 Is Bitcoin Out Of Danger? As the May 1st retrace developed, crypto analyst Rekt Capital highlighted the similarities between Bitcoin’s 2016 and 2024 post-halving performances. He suggested that the flagship cryptocurrency’s price development came “as no surprise,” as it was mirroring the “post-Halving Bitcoin Danger Zone” of 2016. Per the analyst, the “Danger Zone” is officially over, which BTC is “celebrating with a good bounce from the Re-Accumulation Range Low support.” He stated that May could be an “unremarkable” month for the largest cryptocurrency, potentially continuing next month. However, Bitcoin is “running out of unremarkable months” before the beginning of this cycle’s “Parabolic Phase.” Additionally, Rekt Capital considers that BTC’s sell-side momentum is starting to show signs of slowing down, “slowly developing a curl against the $60,000 support.” Per the post, Bitcoin must continue to hold this support zone for the curl to “progress and eventually lift up.” BTC's curl pattern developing. Source: Rekt Capital Similarly, analyst Bluntz identified a bullish engulfing pattern on Thursday, considering there would be “a solid engulfing on the daily close.” To the analyst, it appeared that the “next push-up into ATH has started.” This morning, Bluntz confirmed the pattern formation and announced to his followers that this cycle’s Round 2 began, which would lead to a “fresh ATH.” BTC’s Strength Could Lead The Price To 6-Figures Following the bullish analysis, CryptoJelle stated that BTC “is looking good.” Per his post, the cryptocurrency “has nearly completed a full reset,” as it’s back to the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Additionally, the chart displays a “bullish MACD cross” below the zero line and the “first higher low in a long time,” suggesting a positive divergence. Jelle highlights that BTC’s price is again pushing into the trendline that “has pushed prices lower over the past weeks.” Despite the higher low, he points out the necessity of reclaiming the $63,000 support zone before new highs come. For these new highs, he set an $82,000 target for BTC’s price, suggesting that a 6-figure price for the flagship cryptocurrency is possible during this cycle. #Bitcoin is pushing into the trendline that has pushed prices lower over the past weeks — once again.

He considers that the run is not over, as the “Halving” event occurred just a few weeks ago, and BTC’s price has been consolidating around the previous cycle’s all-time high for a long period.

Such a trend suggests the buying pressure is higher (or the selling pressure is lower) on the former platform than on the latter. On the other hand, the negative premium implies Coinbase might be observing a higher amount of selling than Binance, as the asset is currently trading at a lower price there. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 30-day moving average (MA) of the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium over the last couple of years: The 30-day MA value of the metric seems to have been going down in recent weeks | Source: CryptoQuant As displayed in the above graph, the 30-day MA Bitcoin Coinbase Premium has been positive recently, suggesting that Coinbase users have supported the asset through the rally. Coinbase is popularly known as the preferred platform of the US-based institutional entities, while Binance has a more global user base. As such, the premium’s value can provide hints about how the behavior of the American whales differs from that of the rest of the world. From the chart, it’s visible that the buying pressure from these institutional traders peaked alongside the price top but has since been declining. The metric continues to be positive overall, although it’s now quite close to the neutral zero mark. In the graph, the quant has highlighted an interesting pattern that the cryptocurrency has followed regarding the Coinbase Premium during the last two years. It would appear that whenever the indicator has hit bottom in negative territory and reversed back to an uptrend, the coin’s price has observed a rebound.

An example of this trend also played out just earlier in the year, when a reversal in the indicator led to Bitcoin observing a rally in which the asset would eventually break its all-time high. The Coinbase Premium is currently riding a downtrend, but it’s yet to dip into negative territory. The analyst explains that BTC is in a “wait and see” phase, where a rebound might be a bit longer out. The metric has to first decline more and reach a reversal point, at least if the historical pattern has to repeat. BTC Price Bitcoin had slipped under $61,000 earlier, but the asset has found a slight rebound in the past day, returning above $62,700.
