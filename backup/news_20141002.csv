42426100,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIib1h,1412292683,Spain's Bitcoin Boulevard Aims to be World's Biggest and Best,"More than 20 merchants in Madrid's busiest shopping district will open for a Bitcoin Boulevard-style event today.  While streets in Arnhem, The Hague and Cleveland have all hosted similar bitcoin awareness initiatives, organiser Félix Montero says his event, Calle Bitcoin, will be the world’s biggest yet.  Around 200 bitcoin users are expected to attend the two-day spectacle, which is to feature a pub crawl, treasure hunt and photo competition, alongside giveaways in the digital currency.  While Spain’s bitcoin community is small, Montero hopes the outdoor event will showcase the currency’s purchasing power and utility to those in the ""offline"" world.  “We thought a bitcoin street was the best way to prove that bitcoin payments stand up even to the pressure of a crowded bar or shop in speed and flexibility,” he said.  Gold mile  The 'calle' itself is located at luxury shopping hotspot Serrano Street – also known as the city’s ‘Gold Mile’.  Besides the usual coffee shops, bars and restaurants, the 1.5 km area also features an international fashion boutique, a design hotel, an architect practice and – bizarrely – a gynaecologist.  Montero explained:  ""Once merchants saw that the bar next door was sporting a 'Bitcoin Accepted Here' sticker they lost all fear and wanted in!""  Experimental event  The event is largely experimental, involving all kinds of payment mechanisms, apps and processors, both better- and lesser-known, Montero said.  Though BitPay, Blockchain and Coinbase are ‘gold’ sponsors, smaller regional startups such as Coinffeine, Avatar BTC and Bitcoin Spain, owner of the country's first Robocoin ATM, will be out in force to greet passers-by.  Nicolas Cary, Blockchain’s CEO, praised the event for its commitment to the local bitcoin community, stating: “Calle Bitcoin is a perfect example of how grass roots efforts are making a big difference locally.""  Moe Levin, director of European business development at BitPay, echoed this sentiment – adding that events like this underscore both the technology's ethos and its community:  ""There is no other payment system in the world as open-source and community oriented as bitcoin. These are two very unique traits.""  Tech-savvy supporters  Calle's 13 volunteers have been instrumental in getting the project off the ground, often taking time out from their full-time jobs to visit prospective merchants and give tutorials on bitcoin point-of-sale systems.  Fernando Bitti Loureiro, a regular at bitcoin meetups in Madrid, sees the project as an opportunity to dispel common misconceptions about the digital currency first-hand. He added:  ""The information about bitcoin one finds on the Internet is [either] too technical, too speculative or too ideological.""  Another volunteer, Santiago Márquez Solís, is hoping to engage visitors with his Flappy Bird-inspired android game. Unlike the original however, players must navigate through a series of fast-moving buildings using their bitcoin avatar. After crashing (inevitably very quickly) they are greeted with information about shops participating in the event.  In the spirit of open-source development, the whole project has been documented on popular forum Bitcoin Talk since its inception. Montero hopes that fellow Spanish-speakers will use these conversations as a blueprint to create their own events in the future.  Calle's own future looks promising too, as each merchant has pledged to continue accepting bitcoin for at least three months after this week's event.  Montero is confident many will stick with the currency past this point, and hopes to scale up in 2015, adding:  “Hopefully, next year we can do it with 100 merchants.”  Images via Calle Bitcoin and VICTOR TORRES / Shutterstock.com",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Grace Caffyn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/10/02/spains-bitcoin-boulevard-aims-to-be-worlds-biggest-and-best,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e98876c2df0d66bb50f0a777b80c84614d20ac9f-2560x1808.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426093,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIiarh,1412287402,Bill Gates: Bitcoin Highlights the Utility of Digital Money,"During an interview on Bloomberg TV's ""Street Smart"" today, Bill Gates responded to new questions about bitcoin and its potential to bring innovation to the payments industry.  The technology advisor at Microsoft, founder of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and recently crowned richest man in the world, in turn, provided short and somewhat muddled responses, though Gates addressed bitcoin more specifically than he has in the past.  Calling bitcoin ""exciting"" because of its ability to provide a relatively low-cost transaction network, Gates told Bloomberg:  ""Bitcoin is better than currency in that you don't have to be physically in the same place, and of course for large transactions currency can get pretty inconvenient.""  However, while seemingly positive, Gates went on to suggest that though he believes the world needs lower-cost payments solutions, bitcoin is perhaps not the best example of how the market should look to provide this solution.  Gates suggested that bitcoin may not appeal to the mass market due to its relative anonymity, as well as its associations with terrorism and money laundering.  He added:  ""The customers we're talking about aren't trying to be anonymous, they're willing to be known, so bitcoin technology is key and you can add to it or you could build a similar technology where there's enough attribution where people feel comfortable that this is nothing to do with terrorism or any type of money laundering.""  The interview took place at Sibos 2014, a banking and financial conference held in Boston, where Gates also addressed the challenges facing the financial industry and the underbanked.  Notably, the first day of the event was dedicated in part to highlighting developments in the digital currency industry, with representatives from Circle, Ethereum and Ripple Labs.  Evolution in thought  Though brief, the statements mark an evolution in Gates' public statements on bitcoin.  This February, the noted technologist and philanthropist participated in an Ask Me Anything on the social network Reddit where he was asked for his thoughts on bitcoin by multiple users.  At the time, Gates largely sidestepped the issue, choosing instead to focus his praise on digital money networks like Kenya's centralized mobile service, M-Pesa.  Gates addressed bitcoin only once, saying:  “The foundation is involved in digital money, but unlike bitcoin it would not be anonymous digital money.”  Hat tip to Bloomberg  Image via Bloomberg",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/10/02/bill-gates-bitcoin-highlights-the-utility-of-digital-money,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d8fe6d1e25157fab97103202d62cc21a2b9edc5e-1431x792.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426106,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIibDh,1412280955,Bitcoin Startup Brings Collectible Card Games to the Block Chain,"Deckbound is a lot like other collectible card games – the most well-known of which is Magic: The Gathering, which is played online and on tabletops. The difference is that each Deckbound card exists as a transaction on the block chain.  The Isle of Man-based maker of Deckbound, EVA Plexus, is run by founder Gareth Jenkins, who has run an independent game development studio in the past.  Jenkins said block chain-linked cards allow players to trade them without the involvement of the game-maker, harking back to when CCGs first came on the scene as purely paper-based games.  ""Because cards were physically printed, you ended up with all these interesting systems that exist in the communities around the cards. For example, most Magic [tournament] rules came from players themselves, not Wizards of the Coast,"" he said, referring to the company that created Magic.  Jenkins said fusing cards to the block chain means that each card would then become a permanent digital object that would be independent of its maker.  ""By basing it on the block chain [...] we provide a level of guarantee to players that if, for whatever reason, in two years our business goes bust, everything is still public,"" he said.  This is a departure from the conventional way online CCGs are managed, where the publisher acts as the central authority issuing new cards, deciding how cards can be traded and ensuring that the systems are in place to sustain the game world.  He added:  ""In the digital space, you're tied to using someone else's system, you can't come up with the rules yourself. It's completely opaque.""  Big money in digital card games  Digital CCGs are proving to be major money-makers for big game publishers.  Hasbro, which owns Magic's maker Wizards of the Coast, reported $1.3bn in sales from its game division in 2013, representing growth of 10% over the previous year. The games and toys giant doesn't break out figures for individual titles, but singled out Magic for contributing to its revenue gains.  Meanwhile, Activision Blizzard, which owns the hugely popular World of Warcraft and Diablo franchises, launched its own online CCG, Hearthstone, in March. The company said it expected Hearthstone to exceed $100m in revenues, with Blizzard Entertainment chief executive Michael Morhaime saying the title ""has been exceeding all of our expectations"", in an August earnings call with investors.  How it works  Jenkins has had to perform some complicated manoeuvres to link Deckbound cards to the block chain. For starters, he built a system that allows various tags to be attached to a bitcoin transaction, called BitBind. The system can be thought of as a simplified implementation of coloured coins, Jenkins said.  The BitBind system is used by Deckbound to attach various card attributes to a given transaction, effectively turning that transaction into a Deckbound card.  ""BitBind allows us to follow things around the block chain [...] it allows players to freely trade cards; it doesn't involve us, but we still know where [the cards] are, and so on,"" Jenkins said.  Because each Deckbound card is essentially a bitcoin transaction, it also has a nominal bitcoin value, which is a percentage of the price of that card. The first Deckbound cards are priced at $1 worth of bitcoin, so each card has a value of $0.25 worth of bitcoin.  The BitBind system sits on top of the block chain, so it doesn't write any information to the bitcoin public ledger. It is currently hosted by Jenkins' company and its accessible through an API. Jenkins said the plan is to make the project open-source and available to anyone to run in the long-term.  Turning cards into investment assets  Deckbound's next link to the block chain is its crowdfunding scheme. Jenkins is trying to raise funds for the game by turning cards into return-yielding assets.  Instead of issuing new cards and slapping a price tag on them, Deckbound cards are issued from a 'genesis block'. Each block is released when it hits a funding target. Investors who fund the block then stand to earn a return as the card is traded among players, gaining or losing value.  The first block has raised 30.4 BTC, putting it at 41% of its funding target of 75 BTC. The minimum projected return, according to Deckbound's website, is 130% of the principal invested.  Collectible cards have long been traded on marketplaces, fetching sky-high prices. The most expensive Magic card on record sold on eBay last year for more than $27,000, while the most expensive Pokemon trading card was on the block for $100,000 last September.  Fundraising  Deckbound is also selling cards ahead of its release in an 'alpha' stage of development this year. The game can be played for free with 'Nomad' cards supplied by the game-maker, but packs of cards can also be purchased, with prices starting at $5.  According to Jenkins, 5,000 cards have already been sold, worth about 2.5 BTC in all.  ""The response we've had so far has been great,"" he said.  One gaming enthusiast on Bitcointalk, who is a self-professed player of Magic and Hearthstone, had this to say about Deckbound's concept:  ""I love these strategic card games [...] I think with the right marketing, this could become huge!""  Part of the reason Jenkins is bootstrapping the game is because he's encountered difficulty finding investors who are comfortable both in the cryptocurrency world and in the gaming space – although failed exchange Mt Gox, notably, started life as a trading platform for Magic cards.  Jenkins described one conversation with a prominent Silicon Valley investor who was clued-in on bitcoin, but struggled to understand the market for online card games. Still, he said he was hopeful he would be in a better position to raise traditional funding if the game gets some traction with customers first.

42426102,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIib5h,1412276141,Coinbase Expands European Service to 5 More Markets,"Coinbase has expanded its European presence to an additional five countries following the launch of its services in the region early last month.  The move  allows consumers in Denmark, Ireland, Poland, Sweden and Switzerland to buy and sell up to €500 in bitcoin through Coinbase.  The US-based bitcoin services provider initially rolled out services to Italy, Spain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria, Cyprus, Finland, Greece, Latvia, Malta, Portugal and Slovakia.  Coinbase has also increased the daily buy and sell limits to €2,000 for its users in France, Italy, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands and Finland.  Coinbase  has emerged as a frontrunner in the US market for bitcoin service providers, with more than 1.6 million users subscribing to its wallet service and billion-dollar corporations like Overstock, Expedia and DISH integrating its merchant services.  By expanding into Europe, the company aims to underscore bitcoin’s cross-border payments potential and bring bitcoin buying capabilities to new markets.  Brokerage service competition  The news comes as a number of similar bitcoin brokerage services are seeking to serve the broader European market.  Last week, Coinify announced an undisclosed, multimillion-dollar investment from SEED Capital, which it told CoinDesk it intends to use to extend its processing services to merchants, as well as its buy and sell services to consumers.  Similarly, the UK- and Lithuania-based SpectroCoin recently launched its bitcoin merchant processing solution for the Europe, building on its existing brokerage services.  Speaking to CoinDesk, CEO Vytautas Karalevičius talked about the importance of economies of scale as one motivator for providing an all-encompassing bitcoin services solution – wallet, exchange and merchant services.  Merchant processing competition  Though Coinbase has not formally made the European market part of its merchant acquisition strategy, a number of startups are already establishing themselves in this area, meaning there could be competition should the company choose to do so.  A number of large European companies accept bitcoin through Paymium, a European startup that services roughly 600,000 users, offering a bitcoin exchange as well as bitcoin payment processing tools for merchants.  On Tuesday, French online fashion retailer Showroomprive began offering bitcoin payments to its customers, becoming Paymium’s largest merchant client and Europe’s largest bitcoin merchant.  Further, Coinbase's largest competitor in the North American merchant processing space, BitPay, is already making Europe a priority, allegedly adding 200 regional merchants to its service each week.

42426084,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIiafh,1412266238,Ulbricht Seeks Pre-Trial Hearing to Challenge FBI Claims,"UPDATE (3rd October 10:34 BST): According to a new document uncovered by TechCrunch, expert witness and open-source software lawyer Joshua J Horowitz has disputed the FBI's account of how it located a back-end server belonging to Ross Ulbricht.      The defence of alleged Silk Road mastermind Ross Ulbricht has filed a motion asking the court to dismiss evidence and strike parts of the indictment against him.  Ulbricht's team argues that the government’s claim of how it gained access to some digital evidence raises questions and requires an evidentiary hearing, at which time it hopes to have the case dismissed. Additionally, the latest filing rejects an FBI explanation for its investigation as implausible, vague and lacking forensic evidence.  The reply memorandum of law was filed on 1st October and raises many of the same questions as the original memorandum filed on 1st August. That document asserted that the same Fourth Amendment protections could be applied in order to dismiss a significant volume of evidence collected in the seizure of Silk Road web servers.  Specifically, the defence argues that the 'fruit of the poisonous tree’ doctrine could be used to dismiss a chain of supposedly tainted evidence collected by investigators.  The defence further claims that some electronically stored information (ESI) was collected without a warrant and therefore all evidence collected using said information was inadmissible under the doctrine.  Government criticised  The new filing criticises the government for its failure to address a number of issues raised in the August motion.  In the document, Ulbricht’s defence counsel Joshua Dratel states:  “Indeed, the government’s response is remarkable for what it fails to confront at all: an entire current class of Supreme Court opinions that have adapted and updated Fourth Amendment jurisprudence to accommodate the essential privacy imperatives of the digital age.”  Dratel lists a number of precedents that were not cited or addressed by the court, commenting that the court assists the government in defending unconstitutional searches by “pretending that those cases do not exist, and that it is still 1979”.  Dratel argues that opinions in Riley vs California and US vs Jones recognise that privacy interests in electronically stored information are covered by the Fourth Amendment.  “The government’s inability even to discuss those cases, and their Fourth Amendment implications, simply demonstrates the bankruptcy of its arguments in opposition,” Dratel argues.  Servers still an issue  The defence also addressed the legality of FBI’s investigation. The crux of the ‘poisonous tree’ argument is the assertion that the FBI used illegal means to identify and locate Silk Road servers in Iceland. If the defence can prove that the FBI bent the rules and located the servers using such means, all the evidence collected from them would be rendered inadmissible.  However, the FBI responded to the allegations with a 58-page filing submitted earlier this month. In the document FBI agent Christopher Tarbell offered an account of how the servers were located, dismissing allegations of illegal activities or NSA involvement.  The new defence filing criticises the government for attempting to create a ""straw man"" by contending that it was not necessary to explain how the servers were located in order to establish probable cause. It goes on to argue that Tarbell failed to maintain “any record of his purported means of access” to the Silk Road servers.  The filing states:  “Indeed, by not preserving what he claims he did – and preservation would have been a simple, automated task – he violated the most rudimentary protocols of any forensic investigation, much less one involving digital data and communications.”  Dratel also takes issue with the timeline of the FBI’s requests to the Icelandic authorities, stating that the decision to re-image server contents in July 2013 in order to preserve evidence clearly points to a planned, orchestrated, and directed action implemented for the benefit of US law enforcement.",NEUTRAL,없음,REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/10/02/ulbricht-seeks-pre-trial-hearing-to-challenge-fbi-claims,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/78135d3fb21b523976806e9b032dee36d9d56ba8-1654x859.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The meeting was opened by Paul Ferris, the head of the UKDCA’s communications working group, who delivered a rundown of the association’s activities over the last few months. Following the introduction, eight out of the 10 candidates took to the floor to address the meeting.  Five-member board elected  The majority of the ballots were cast by proxy, with a total of 54 out of the 76 eligible members taking part in the vote. Candidates needed to win more than 50% of the vote to get elected – 28 votes or more.  The results were announced shortly after the vote took place. The new board replaces an interim board, which has steered the UKDCA since its formation.  The five newly elected members are:  Paul Gordon, Coinscrum – 48 votes  Tom Robinson, Elliptic – 36 votes  Adam Vaziri, Diacle – 36 votes  Adam Cleary, Bullion Bitcoin – 33 votes  Eitan Jankelewitz, Sheridanshttp://www.sheridans.co.uk/lawyers/eitan-jankelewitz.aspx – 33 votes  Diverse cryptocurrency expertise  Paul Gordon carried the day with a clear majority. Best known for launching Coinscrum's educational and networking events in London, he also played an instrumental role in the establishment of the UKDCA and has served as an interim board member since its creation.  Tom Robinson is a prominent member of the UK cryptocurrency community, a founding member of the UKDCA and a co-founder of bitcoin storage service Elliptic. Like Jankelewitz, Robinson has also discussed bitcoin with government officials and his efforts led to Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs’ (HMRC) reclassification of bitcoin for VAT purposes.  ""Now the hard work begins,"" he said in reaction to the news. Citing banking as a priority area for the organisation, he added that ""slow and steady progress is being made"".  Adam Vaziri, the second lawyer on the board, specialises in FinTech compliance services with his company Diacle and is currently a consultant for compliance solutions provider Neopay. He expressed a desire to build alliances with other associations around the world, and to introduce new technologies and currencies to the UKDCA, including what he described as a ""self-regulatory framework"".  Adam Cleary of gold-to-bitcoin exchange Bullion Bitcoin had also been an interim board member and was actively involved in the creation of the association. Cleary is also the chief executive of Coin Capital Ltd and an executive director at cryptocurrency gift voucher provider pock.io.  Intellectual property lawyer Eitan Jankelewitz has been involved in a number of bitcoin projects and has worked with mining hardware manufacturers, bitcoin exchanges, developers and bitcoin-accepting retailers. A regular speaker at bitcoin events, Jankelewitz has been a member of a number of delegations engaging UK government officials in discussions about bitcoin.    ""A few months and a load of new members later, I’m delighted to be a part of the first elected board,"" he said, adding:      ""There is still a lot to be done in the UK in order to make it a welcoming place for digital currency businesses. I think it’s important that regulators and government hear a consistent message and the UKDCA should help ensure that this message takes the wider UK digital currency community’s goals into account.""            Brief biographies of all 10 candidates are available on UKDCA’s website and CoinDesk's coverage of the run-up to the election can be found here.  The vision for the future  The UKDCA was officially launched on 24thMarch with the aim of promoting bitcoin adoption through public debate and helping shape growth-friendly policy and regulation for digital currency in the UK. The association is registered as a non-profit organization.  At the time, Cleary described the association as a UK-centric organisation, although the UKDCA has been in touch with the Bitcoin Foundation to discuss future cooperation. However, the UKDCA is not a branch of the Bitcoin Foundation and, in some respects, is similar to the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada and other regional bitcoin associations.  The UKDCA currently has four working groups that specialise in different areas of digital currency. Despite their different backgrounds, its new members have no designated roles at board-level, instead choosing to discuss matters raised by each committee as a group.  Gordon said contact has already been made with Innovate Finance, a group that aims to promotes the interests of the UK FinTech industry, adding that the UKDCA is open to working with any organisation that can help its goal of promoting digital currency.

42426110,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIibHh,1412246620,"Inside ShapeShift's Cryptocurrency Exchange, No Login Required","The exchange sector is one of the corners of the digital currency economy that has seen the most radical change and developments in recent years.  The evolution in the exchange industry can be traced by the rise and fall of major platforms. From the much-publicized collapse of Mt Gox to the launch of websites like Bitfinex and others that enable advanced trading activities, the exchange ecosystem has pushed new innovations and offerings and, as some might argue, will continue to do so moving forward.  But how the landscape will look even months from now is a tough question to answer. Many elements of the crypto 2.0 cluster of projects point to a new breed of exchanges wherein assets of all kinds, including digital currencies, can be transferred person to person.  On the other end of the spectrum, the market is beginning to see non-centralized services that users can take advantage of without even creating a unique account.  ShapeShift.io  is one of these services. Conceived in the winter of 2013 and launched last month, the service is, as described by creator and CEO Beorn Gonthier, like a cryptocurrency vending machine.  He told CoinDesk:  “ShapeShift is the seller or buyer of coins, so when you come to the site and you have bitcoins, and want litecoins, we sell you our litecoins. This is different than a traditional exchange which pairs you with other buyers and sellers. We are kind of like a vending machine.”  The website displays how much coin liquidity is available at a given time, which Gonthier said is restocked based on demand. In addition to bitcoin and litecoin, ShapeShift began offering support for dogecoin, peercoin and darkcoin yesterday.  How it works  CoinDesk tested the system by trying to buy 0.007 BTC ($2.64 at today's exchange rates) worth of litecoins. The process begins with the user selecting the coin pair they wish to trade.  Once the user enters their payment address, the service generates a bitcoin deposit address, as well as a working exchange rate for the currency pair. It also confirms the deposit address – a feature no doubt welcome for those concerned about irreversibly sending their bitcoins to the wrong address.  After the transaction has been processed, ShapeShift offers both a link to a receipt-generation tool and access to the block chain for the cryptocurrency the user has purchased. Transaction broadcasting happens automatically and, in our case, within a few minutes the newly purchased litecoins had arrived.  The service places dynamic limits on the amount of coins in a given denomination that can be deposited. According to Gonthier, one of the company’s primary goals is to increase liquidity in conjunction with any rise in volume and demand.  He told CoinDesk that the service is a reflection of the fundamentals underlying bitcoin itself, saying that the project team wanted something unlike the order book-based systems.  Gonthier remarked:  “Bitcoin changes how money works on a very fundamental level. So, its real benefits are felt when systems utilize it to do something that wasn't possible with legacy systems. A normal order book exchange is old news – nothing really innovative about that.”  Security a priority  When asked about security, Gonthier acknowledged the realities of the exchange landscape and how it remains a primary target for would-be cryptocurrency thieves. A key weakness is that any centralized exchange holds the private keys to customer funds, meaning any event that results in compromised security can result in the loss of coins held.  Gonthier said that ShapeShift sidesteps this problem, by minimizing the transaction process to the point where the service never holds any customer funds for longer than needed:  “A user only needs to trust us for about 10 seconds. One of the most beautiful things about cryptocurrency is that you control your own coins (via your keys), so we believe that the more that can be preserved [and] encouraged, the better. Thus we never hold customer funds.”  Gonthier noted that ShapeShift only stocks its hot wallets with enough coins to meet the demands of an average day of volume, adding that these amounts could grow in the future.  Looking ahead  Ultimately, ShapeShift hopes to position itself as a viable alternative in the exchange sector for buyers and sellers that don’t want to worry about securing a centralized account.  Feedback has been positive thus far, including from figures like litecoin creator Charlie Lee who noted in a published testimonial that he had “been waiting for” this type of solution.  Gonthier told CoinDesk that among the company’s flagships products is its API, which he hopes will be used more broadly in the future to enable cross-digital currency acceptance. He said that even big players like BitPay could increase the scope of their services by adding de-facto altcoin support via ShapeShift’s API.  Gonthier explained that in this scenario, BitPay's integration of alternative currencies would be virtually seamless, saying:  ""This way, BitPay wouldn't need to change the core of their system to support new coins because they'd just be receiving bitcoin like normal.”  Images via ShapeShift, Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | DOGE | EXCHANGE | LTC,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/10/02/inside-shapeshifts-cryptocurrency-exchange-no-login-required,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d4b231eab352df3d212fb82fc0abe8e1eeeff113-834x547.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
