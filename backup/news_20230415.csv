42412271,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl3yGQ,1681589256,U.S. House Committee Publishes Draft Stablecoin Bill,"The U.S. House Financial Services Committee published a draft version of a potential landmark stablecoin bill, with proposals including a moratorium on stablecoins backed by other cryptocurrencies and a request to study a central bank digital currency (CBDC).  The bill, available on the committee's hearing page, represents the first major piece of crypto legislation to move in 2023, and follows two key incidents over the past year involving stablecoins: the blowup of terraUSD (UST), which was backed by a token called LUNA, and the second-largest one, USD coin (USDC), temporarily becoming unmoored from $1.  It creates definitions for payment stablecoin issuers, echoing a term former Senator Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) used when he introduced his own stablecoin bill in 2022.  The moratorium on stablecoins like UST would last until a study can be conducted. The bill also seeks a study of the potential impact of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) issued by the Federal Reserve.  Punchbowl News first reported on the bill's publication.  A House Financial Services subcommittee will hold a hearing on stablecoins on Wednesday, featuring Dante Disparte from Circle Internet Financial, which issues USDC; the Blockchain Association's Jake Chervinsky; Columbia Professor Austin Campbell and New York Department of Financial Services Superintendent Adrienne Harris.  That hearing will come a day after the full Financial Services Committee meets to hear from Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler.  A spokesperson for Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the chair of the committee, told CoinDesk the bill published on the site had been circulating among lawmakers since last fall. (It had not previously been shared with the public.) A spokesperson for Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), the ranking member of the committee, did not respond to a request for comment by press time.

It’s no wonder that social sentiment around this exciting cryptocurrency has reached near-euphoric levels, with holders and investors alike giddy at the prospect of continued gains. But with a large cluster of INJ holders now approaching the break-even point, some are beginning to wonder whether a price correction might be imminent. The question on everyone’s lips is — will INJ’s rally keep going strong or is a correction on the horizon? Related Reading: Arbitrum (ARB) Leads Top 50 Cryptos With Double-Digit Gain In Weekly Rankings Injective Token (INJ) Experiences Significant Price Growth INJ has seen a surge in price over the past 24 hours, with Coingecko reporting a price of $8.16 per token. This represents a 15% increase in value during that time period. Over the course of the last seven days, INJ has experienced even more significant growth, with a 47% rally in price. Investors and traders will no doubt be keeping a close eye on this cryptocurrency in the coming days to see if the upward momentum can continue. Source: Coingecko INJ Continues To Soar, But Could Face Correction As of today, INJ has once again hit a year-to-date high, demonstrating its impressive performance in 2023. However, the latest data from Santiment’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) analysis suggests that a price correction could be on the horizon for INJ. MVRV analysis determines potential buy/sell zones by comparing an asset’s average acquisition price to its current market value. According to charts, INJ’s MVRV could soon reach a critical sell zone, indicating that a price correction is possible. Although most INJ holders who bought in the past month are currently enjoying profits of around 34%, historical MVRV data suggests that holders typically book profits around the 42% zone. This means that once INJ’s price approaches the $6.9 zone, a retracement could be in the cards. Injective Updates For 2023 Injective has recently announced its partnership with Eclipse to introduce the first interchain Solana Sealevel Virtual Machine (SVM) called the Cascade. This innovative technology will enable developers to leverage the Injective blockchain to deploy Solana dApps seamlessly. Injective (INJ) total market cap currently at $622 million on the weekend chart at TradingView.com The Cascade would be the first iteration of leveraging interchain security for rollups, offering enhanced scalability and efficiency for developers. This technology has the potential to improve the performance of dApps and create new opportunities for developers to create value in the blockchain space. On April 10, developers released an upgrade for the Injective mainnet. The latest update would add improved smart contract capabilities to the mainnet, aggregated user accounts, automation, and other advanced features.

11786787,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=526965,1681568438,"Bitcoin Loses Grip On $31,000 Handle: Experts Predict What To Expect","The price of bitcoin (BTC) fell from its lofty $31,000 perch Saturday, making investors anxious when the alpha coin will reclaim the spot. The price fallback has led analysts to share their projections for the leading cryptocurrency. According to market analyst Michaël van de Poppe, while Bitcoin appears strong, it may experience minor corrections during its uptrend. He identifies the $31,700-32,000 range as a significant resistance level, where he expects to see price highs in the near future. Related Readings: The Rise Of Bitcoin Continues: Trader Predicts $60k-$70k Range After Consolidation What The Experts Say Regarding the cryptocurrency market, he mentioned that $25,000 used to be the preferred buying level for many. However, with the recent surge, he anticipates shifting to $28,500, where buying interest may wane. As a result, he now identifies $29,700 as a potential new support or price floor to keep an eye on. Conversely, according to the social media personality CryptoTony, the trajectory of Bitcoin remains uncertain. Despite breaching $30,000, he advises traders not currently invested to exercise patience and observe how the market responds to potential support levels. In contrast, CryptoTommey, a popular crypto analyst, believes that the price trajectory of Bitcoin remains uncertain. He noted that although BTC may briefly touch $32,000, the leading currency will most likely retest the support levels of $25,000 or $28,000 to sustain the ongoing bullish momentum. This analysis shows the differing point of view on the current market run, which has puzzled many stakeholders. Bitcoin Has Once Again Sparked Investor Greed At $30,000 Bitcoin has surpassed expectations in 2023 with its bullish run. New trends have characterized this particular run; however, one metric that stands out consistently is the fear and greed metrics. The latest data from Coinstats indicates that the latest price spike to $30,000 has resulted in greed returning to the market after nearly three weeks. As per previous trends, it could signal a potential price downturn when greed becomes dominant, so it identifies this moment as a “selling opportunity.” Related Readings: Arbitrum (ARB) Leads Top 50 Cryptos With Double-Digit Gain In Weekly Rankings Conversely, it suggests that when fear prevails, it may be a favorable time to buy and await future appreciation. However, it’s important to note that this indicator does not disclose the source of its data for these results. On the other hand, the fear and greed indicator compiled by Alternative Explorer indicates that the Bitcoin market has been driven by greed for most of 2023. It reveals that with the cryptocurrency surpassing $30,000, greed has reached its highest point in 2023. Nevertheless, the crypto market has continued to prove its dynamism with new trends. For example, the trading volume of the BTC/USD pair has been falling since mid-March, suggesting that there’s little market force to push the price higher. However, Bitcoin’s price is yet to falter, with the leading coin shooting to its highest price 10 months earlier in the week.

Stablecoins Have Continued To Flow Into Bitcoin In Recent Days As pointed out by an analyst on Twitter, stablecoins flowing into BTC could be another catalyst behind the recent jump. The relevant indicator here is the “stablecoin supply ratio” (SSR), which measures the ratio between the market cap of Bitcoin and combined market cap of the stablecoins. Generally, investors use stables when they want to escape the volatility associated with most other assets in the market. When such investors who have taken shelter in stablecoins eventually feel that prices in the volatile markets are right to jump back in, they shift the stables back into their desired coins, thus providing a buying pressure to their prices. Because of this reason, the supply of these fiat-tied tokens can be thought of as the available buying supply for other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Now, since the SSR compares the BTC supply with that of the stablecoins, it can help us know the relative potential amount of buying power for BTC that’s available in the sector currently. Related Reading: The Rise Of Bitcoin Continues: Trader Predicts $60k-$70k Range After Consolidation The below chart shows the trend in the Bitcoin SSR over the last year. Looks like the value of the metric has gone up in recent days | Source: James V. Straten on Twitter When the Bitcoin SSR has a low value, it means the market cap of Bitcoin is low compared to that of the stablecoins right now, and hence, a large amount of buying pressure may be available in the market. On the other hand, the indicator having a high value suggests the current stablecoin supply doesn’t have too much buying power available to purchase BTC. Related Reading: Ark Invest Analyst Believes Bitcoin Could Reach $1 Million, But How? From the chart, it’s apparent that the SSR had sharply risen to a pretty high value when BTC had broken above the $28,000 level. This suggests that investors were possibly deploying their stablecoin reserves into the asset to fuel the rally. After the break, however, the asset had been stuck in consolidation for a few weeks around this level. While this was happening, though, the SSR had been constantly declining, implying that some fresh stablecoin gunpowder was accumulating in the market. In the last few days, as the cryptocurrency’s price has risen above the $30,000 level, the SSR indicator has also once again shot up. This pattern may mean that it was the stables that had piled up in the market that were behind this latest leg up in the rally. Naturally, the higher the SSR goes, the more likely BTC gets to a top as the buying pressure runs dry. But since the metric was able to hit even higher values during the surge above $28,000, it’s possible that the cryptocurrency could have more room to grow before a high is hit.

Solana Whale Transfers $22.1 Million In SOL To Coinbase According to data from the cryptocurrency transaction tracker service Whale Alert, a large transaction has been spotted on the Solana blockchain during the past day. The transfer in question saw the movement of about 900,000 SOL on the network, worth about $22.1 million at the time the transaction went through. As the amount involved here is quite large, it’s likely that a whale entity was behind this transfer. Movements of the whales can sometimes have noticeable impacts on the market due to the sheer scale of the coins involved in them, so they can be something to watch out for. As for exactly how a whale transfer would influence the price of the cryptocurrency, though, it depends on what the sender of the transaction intended to do with it. Related Reading: Ark Invest Analyst Believes Bitcoin Could Reach $1 Million, But How? Here are some additional details of the latest Solana whale transfer that may shed some light on the purpose behind it: Looks like this massive transfer only needed a fee of 0.000019 SOL to be possible | Source: Whale Alert As you can see above, the sending address in the case of this Solana transaction was an unknown wallet, meaning that it was an address unaffiliated with any known centralized platform (like an exchange). Such unknown wallets are generally investors’ personal wallets. The receiving address, on the other hand, was one attached to the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. Transfers like these where coins move from personal wallets to exchange wallets are called exchange inflows. Since one of the main reasons why investors may deposit their assets to these platforms is for selling-related purposes, exchange inflows can have bearish consequences for the price. In the present case, as the transaction is coming from a whale and involves a significant movement of tokens to an exchange, the price may face some visible decline in the near term. The cryptocurrency’s price has in fact already gone down a bit since the transaction has taken place, but it’s currently unclear whether the drawdown has come as a result of this transfer or not. Related Reading: The Rise Of Bitcoin Continues: Trader Predicts $60k-$70k Range After Consolidation Sometimes, investors deposit their coins to exchanges only so that they can be prepared in advance if an ideal future exit opportunity comes up and thus, don’t immediately pull the trigger on selling them right after the transaction goes through. In such cases, the bearish effect, if any, naturally comes after a delay. It’s also yet uncertain whether the whale truly intended to sell with this transfer, or if it was made for some other purpose entirely. In the latter scenario, the price would feel a neutral effect from this move. SOL Price At the time of writing, Solana is trading around $24.4, up 19% in the last week.

Armstrong believes XRP will kickstart another bull run after the upcoming summary judgment. His recent prediction hinges on a summary judgment in favor of XRP. Related Reading: Ethereum Soars To 11-Month High Amid Massive Staking Withdrawals Every avid crypto participant knows that the SEC vs. Ripple summary judgment will impact the industry. If the SEC wins, more crypto assets will fall under its jurisdiction. But if Ripple wins, it becomes the first crypto asset with regulatory clarity changing the narrative for many other assets. Notably, BitBoy believes that if there’s a settlement, XRP will soar. Bitboy Cites Reasons For Picking XRP BitBoy mentioned in his latest video that the long battle might end in June or July, given the closing trial calendar. He also agreed that Judge Torres might deliver the summary judgment anytime before then. Further, he reiterated that XRP could only kickstart a bullish trend if Ripple wins the battle through an outright win or settlement. But in BitBoy’s opinion, settlement is preferable for Ripple to avoid any further appeal from the commission, which will prolong the legal pressure on the altcoin. Bitboy believes that if the win comes through a settlement, the chances of XRP soaring will increase. The altcoin will become a unique asset since it’ll be the only one declared “non-security” after the tedious trial. Related Reading: Arbitrum (ARB) Leads Top 50 Cryptos With Double-Digit Gain In Weekly Rankings But, some top shots have expressed that a ruling will be the decision, not a settlement. According to the Chief Legal Officer (CLO) at Coinbase, Paul Grewal, a ruling will be the outcome that will trigger an appeal from the SEC. Also, CryptoLaw founder representing Ripple holders John Deaton shared the same view stating that the case will not end in a settlement between the two parties. XRP Will Soar Following Exchange Relisting Another reason Bitboy said it would push the XRP price was if top exchanges such as Coinbase relist it. Notably, after the SEC’s case filing, many crypto exchanges delisted XRP from their platforms, causing a price crash during that period. But during the video, the influencer stated that if these exchanges relist the altcoin after Ripple wins, the price will soar again. This is not the first time the influencer shared such beliefs. On April 4, he posted the same stance on Twitter, stating that XRP will lead the next bull run if it wins without a possibility of an appeal from the SEC. Also, on April 13, Bitboy stated XRP would soon make investors rich, so they should stick with it. Notably, the XRP price is still firm on the $0.5 level it attained on March 29. Also, it is still holding on to its seven-day price gain showing a 0.19% increase in 24 hours. It’s hard to predict its possible move in the coming weeks until the upcoming summary judgment.

As of this writing, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is valued at a price of $0.00001123, tallying a 3.4% increase in the past two weeks, according to data from CoinGecko. However, it is worth noting that the token has been experiencing a slight 0.98% decline in the last 24 hours. Top Shiba Inu Whale Dumps Token According to Etherscan.io data, the 29th-largest Shiba Inu whale dumped a staggering 538 billion SHIB over the course of 12 days in five significant transactions. In a selling spree that kicked off on April 2nd, the whale sold 20 billion SHIB (worth $2.25 million) in one transaction. This huge sale was followed by an additional 100 billion SHIB and 88 billion SHIB on April 5 and April 7, respectively. Four days later, the whale disposed of another 72 billion SHIB valued at $812,880. Finally, in a transaction executed nearly 48 hours from press time, this individual sold off an additional 78 billion SHIB (worth approximately $880k). Despite the relentless sell-off, this Shiba Inu whale still owns a staggering 3.59 trillion SHIB – valued at about $40.31 million. So, it remains to be seen whether the dump will continue or cease. Related Reading: Whale Adds 378.74 Billion Shiba Inu In 3 Days, Good Time To Buy The Dip? Stable Market Condition Not Affected By Massive Burn Numbers The burn numbers in the first half of April have been tremendous, with over 1.52 billion SHIB burned in the past 24 hours. This represents a staggering 45237.78% increase in the token’s burn rate. The Shiba Inu community collectively set fire to these tokens through 12 different transactions, most of which were carried by a mysterious wallet, Koyo (KOY). However, the cryptocurrency’s price has not been reflective of its increasing SHIB burn rate. Despite the positive trend, which also saw nearly 7 billion SHIB tokens burned in March, the value of the coin is not reaching expectations. On the Shiba Inu Telegram channel, a particular member expressed their frustrations at the failure of the SHIB price to move up – as expected. In response, Shytoshi Kusama – the lead developer of SHIB – called the meme coin an exciting investment for swing traders. According to him, following the recent surge in BTC and ETH prices, many traders are expecting the altcoin season to begin soon, which would likely also benefit the SHIB price. Additionally, Kusama mentioned that the burns are still too low to make any significant impact on the value of Shiba Inu. While the SHIB burn numbers sound pretty outstanding, they are much less remarkable when converted to fiat. For example, the record-breaking 1.52 billion SHIB burned in the past day was worth just $17,070. Compared to the coin’s total circulating supply of 589,536,819,759,861 SHIB, only 0.000258% of all circulating SHIB tokens were burned in the last 24 hours. This explains why the price of Shiba Inu has remained stable despite significant market activity.

Solana (SOL) has been one of these tokens, having been on an impressive roll lately. According to data from CoinMarketCap, SOL has gained 18.16% in the last seven days, recording the biggest weekly profit among the top 10 cryptocurrencies in the market. Solana Price Action The 10th largest digital coin began the week trading around $20.32. However, following a general market rally, SOL went as high as $23.63 before experiencing a slight re-correction, bringing its price down to $22.55. Thereafter, Solana soon resumed its bullish course to trade above $25 for the first time since February. Although the altcoin did experience a slight fallback after attaining such heights, current price data shows the token is consolidating and could be preparing for another breakout. At the time of writing, SOL is trading at a market price of $24.4, having declined by 2.19% in the last 24 hours. According to more data from CoinMarketCap, the token’s daily trading volume hovers around $592.98 million, with the market cap set at $9.57 billion. SOL trading at $24.41 | Source: SOLUSD Chart on Tradingview.com Related Reading: The Rise Of Bitcoin Continues: Trader Predicts $60k-$70k Range After Consolidation What’s Behind Solana’s Rise? As usual, there is much speculation surrounding Solana’s recent price rally as many wonder what could be pushing this price increase. That said, the major driving force behind SOL’s market gain could be the general market rally that occurred this week. On Tuesday, April 12, the entire crypto market received a massive boost on news that the U.S. Federal Reserve could soon end its rate-hike cycle. Based on a report by Bloomberg, analysts believe that the American central bank will first increase interest rates by 25 basis points in May and maintain that level for some time. However, the Fed is then expected to start cutting the interest rate later this year or in 2024, allowing more people to invest in volatile assets such as cryptocurrency. Related Reading: SOL Price Prediction: Solana Rally Seems Far From Over, $30 Soon? Another contributing factor to the price of Solana has been the massive hype surrounding the launch of the Solana Mobile Saga – a crypto-first Android device designed to allow users to interact with their digital assets in an easy and secure manner. Saga was launched on Thursday, April 13, and it represents the flagship product of Solana Mobile. Meanwhile, the Solana network has also been attractive in recent weeks to developers.

Also, the histogram bars are green, confirming the bullish sentiment. Chainlink (LINK) is down today as the bulls seek to rally again.

42394067,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvVkXz,1681556400,True Consumer Protection in Crypto Lies Between Centralization and Decentralization,"Narratives about crypto regulations and compliance, or lack thereof, are increasingly missing the point. The general purpose of financial regulation is to maximize consumer protection, prevent fraud and abuse, and ensure well-ordered markets. Broadly speaking, the mission is the same in any jurisdiction, and for any financial regulator.  The conversation in crypto has been overly centered on the crypto industry at the expense of the crypto user. As long as we focus too much on whether specific exchanges must follow new or existing regulations, we miss the chance to consider how consumers can best benefit  Timothy Cradle is the director of regulatory affairs at Blockchain Intelligence Group and compliance advisor to Biokript.  As a regulatory affairs director and compliance consultant, I tend to look at crypto regulation and compliance from a dispassionate view. I must put ideology aside when recommending or attempting to implement a compliance framework for clients. It boils down to a simple question: “What needs to be done to ensure compliance.” Too restrictive and it negatively affects their business model. Too permissive and it sets them up for long-term failure (often in the form of an enforcement action).  I’m certainly not alone. As a former chief compliance officer for a crypto startup, I know other compliance professionals who take personal liability for the compliance programs they recommend so getting it wrong is a career-existential concern. When looking at the two counterposed operating models in crypto, decentralized and centralized services, the potential failures of each can only be addressed if each extreme borrows from the other.  [T]he ultimate goal of crypto is to provide individuals with a better financial system.  In fact, this past week, the U.S. Department of Treasury highlighted many of the noteworthy financial crime risks decentralized finance (DeFi) poses – including money laundering, theft, scams and sanctions evasion. The agency noted “DeFi services often have a controlling organization that provides a measure of centralized administration and governance.”  In my compliance-mind this means that imposing the same sort of regulatory controls expected of a centralized institution are neither impossible, nor unreasonable. In fact, the Digital Assets Anti-Money Laundering bill introduced to the U.S. Senate in December 2022 seems to come to the same conclusion as it seeks to bring any service that “facilitates digital asset transactions” into scope of the Bank Secrecy Act (the U.S. anti-money laundering law). We don’t need the government to tell us that DeFi is uniquely risky; a simple search of crypto theft, rug pulls, hacks and scams will point to a litany of DeFi failures.  The centralized players obviously have their own problems. In just the past month we’ve seen scathing revelations about Binance and its avoidance of the most basic forms of compliance, namely know-your-customer (KYC) and regulatory registration rules. Binance is being sued in the U.S., likely to withdraw from Canada and the U.K. and may lose its license in Australia (whose regulator included a full list of Binance’s regulatory failings in the license announcement).  We’ve also seen multiple players in the U.S. incur fines for not registering their securities products with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which of course means little to no consumer protection was in place for the users of these products. This was all following the year of shame which was 2022 when billions of dollars worth of crypto were lost to outright fraud, market manipulation, embezzlement and bankruptcy – losses largely preventable had these players not also had direct control of their user’s assets.  So what do we need from both sides that makes the other work well?  From centralized entities: transparency and accountability. An inherently accountable organization with public-facing individuals. In other words, a regulated player that is required to ensure it is acting in the best interest of users, disclose the risks in an honest way and can be forced to provide the necessary disclosures to that effect. (And no, unattributed transactions on a blockchain are not adequate levels of transparency.) These firms must also implement cybersecurity, fraud and money laundering controls – a smart-contract audit alone won’t do.  See also: Let's Actually Commit to Proofs of Reserve This Time, OK? | Opinion  From decentralized entities: transaction settlement lying with the service, while asset custody always remains with the user.  We need to remember the ultimate goal of crypto is to provide individuals with a better financial system than what they’ve gotten from legacy systems. The ultimate goal of regulation is to ensure consumers are protected. We get the best result by mixing those two philosophies, in the same way we need to mix the philosophies of centralized finance and decentralized finance to achieve a system that’s fair and useful for all participants.

Boasting a 24-hour trading volume of over $1 billion and a market cap of $12.5 billion, SHIB is ranked the 9th in CoinGecko’s top 100 list. The token has just been subjected to a massive whale push. Recently, a top whale address was revealed to have dumped 538 billion SHIB in the open market. However, the memecoin’s price has not changed that much. As of writing, the token is down slightly in the past 24 hours at 0.3%. But the token remains in the green in other timeframes, with the biggest gains being made back in the weekly timeframe at 9%. Developments Edge Bearish Momentum For Shiba Inu SHIB experienced a 1.5 billion token burn in the past 48 hours. Koyo, a new and mysterious crypto project, has recently burned 1.49 billion on Friday. Collectively, the new project burned 8.75 billion SHB tokens since its inception. This resulted in the burn rate of the token skyrocketing to 3,000%. Adding on to this is the mysterious wallet that incinerated 16.7 million SHIB. At the token’s current price of $0.089854, the burnt SHIB is worth $1.5 million. 🔥 16,712,083 $SHIB -> transferred to dead wallet. https://t.co/bIU9fN3ff7 — Shibburn (@shibburn) April 14, 2023 Supporting this recent on-chain development is an overall positive sentiment in the crypto market.

42412288,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl3yRe,1681546469,"Donald Trump Earned Between $500,001-$1M on NFT Sales: Filings","A filing from the U.S. Office of Government Ethics shows that ex-president Donald Trump has earned anywhere between $500,000 and $1 million from sales of Trump-branded non-fungible tokens (NFT).  Trump also made more than $5 million in income from speaking engagements, the disclosure states.  Interest in the NFTs has spiked after the former president’s arraignment in New York, making for a very profitable week for long-time holders of the tokens.  According to on-chain data from NFT data aggregator CryptoSlam, the number of active wallets holding Trump NFTs has declined 14% to 207 in the last week.  However, during the same time period, trade profit for those HODLers is up by 651% to $12,000.  114 traders were in profit, according to the data, compared to the 285 total transactions during this time period. The trade profit since the project’s inception has been $9,040.  During the last week there was $212,000 in sales volume. In comparison, during the last 90 days, $8.7 million in NFTs have traded hands versus $19 million since inception.  Data from OpenSea shows the collection of 14,000 NFTs is distributed widely, with 65% of wallets only having one NFT, and another 23% having between two and three.  But how much is Trump making on the NFTs?  OpenSea discloses that all sales have a 10% royalty to the creator, which is higher than the average of 5%.  With $19 million in sales since inception, this project would have earned the entity behind it $1.425 million after subtracting OpenSea’s 2.5% fee. Of course, this number could increase in a bull market as royalties from sales are paid out in crypto.  Trump’s personal profit from the NFTs is not clear as neither the ex-president, a political action committee (PAC) nor his campaign is directly involved with designing or minting the NFTs. That’s done by a firm called NFT INC LLC, which has a registered address at a UPS Store in Park City, Utah. However, the LLC itself is incorporated in Wyoming.  Journalist Kurt Eichenwald did some digging and found the LLC has an address at a home in Cheyenne, Wyoming.  The registered agent used to incorporate the LLC is Wyoming Corporate Services, which, as Eichenwald reports, has been tied to global scandal and intrigue from U.S. Defense Department grift to setting up shell companies for former Ukrainian Prime Minister Pavlo Lazarenko.  Dylan and Bill Zanker are two names that have been associated with the project, although unconfirmed by CoinDesk.  In a tweet thread, Web3 security auditor Plum points out the Zankers have been involved with other celebrity NFT projects before, and the domain for the TrumpNFT collection points to the same contact address used for registering domains of their other projects. Bill Zanker has co-authored books with Trump in the past.  Federal Election Commission filings show the Zankers have not donated to Trump or a Trump-related entity up until the end of the 2022 year.  Currently, the highest offer on a Trump NFT is 10 ether (ETH), or $20,000. Most of the offers appear to be in the range of 0.3-0.32 ether ($626.50 to $668).",NEUTRAL,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/04/15/trump-earned-up-to-1m-from-nft-sales-filings,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e947a3c6c3af57cb93d3d28ca04a9d60bec21c50-1371x771.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
