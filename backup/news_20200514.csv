42383739,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9yKUV,1589497216,First State-Owned Entity Joins Libra Association,"Temasek, one of Singapore’s two government-owned investment vehicles, is among the latest companies to join the Libra Association, the consortium Facebook set up to create a global digital currency.      The addition may help explain why the Singapore dollar has figured prominently in Libra’s plans from the early days. In the initial vision of a new currency backed by a basket of different sovereign currencies, the “sing” was included alongside the U.S. dollar, the euro and the British pound. And when Libra pivoted last month to focusing on stablecoins pegged to existing fiat currencies, it mentioned the same four currencies as examples.      ""Our participation in the Libra Association as a member will allow us to contribute towards a regulated global network for cost-effective retail payments,"" Chia Song Hwee, deputy CEO of Temasek, said through a spokesperson. ""Many developments in the space excite us. We look forward to further exploring the potential of the technology.”      Libra also announced Thursday two cryptocurrency-focused investment firms in San Francisco had joined the association: Paradigm, co-founded by Coinbase veteran Fred Ehrsam, and Slow Ventures. (Coinbase has been a Libra member from the start.) The three additions bring the total number of organizations on Libra’s governing council to 27.      Read more: Libra’s Long Road From a Facebook Lab to the Global Stage: A Timeline      Temasek manages $216 billion in assets for Singapore’s government and has previously shown a penchant for blockchain ventures.      “Blockchain technology can play a transformative role in payments networks by enhancing cost efficiencies, creating new business opportunities and accelerating financial inclusion,"" Chia said. ""As part of our journey to better understand its impact across different fronts, we are collaborating with government agencies and companies to explore and advance its use.""      The additions also increase the influence of financiers on Libra’s governing council. With eight members, they’re now the single largest group by industry and together wield nearly 30% of members’ control over the project.      The three newcomers join investment firms Andressen Horowitz, Breakthrough Initiatives, Ribbit Capital, Thrive Capital and Union Square Ventures, all founding members of Libra. By comparison, the association’s nonprofit contingent numbered five after last month’s onboarding of Heifer International.      Ehrsam said Libra's power to take crypto mainstream appealed to his venture capital firm.      “Bridging the gap to a larger mainstream user base is the next step in the evolution of the space,” he said. “Any network which has the potential to normalize crypto societally and offer distribution at this scale is valuable.”      Slow Ventures Principal Jill Carlson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.      Read more: FireBlocks CEO Pours Cold Water on Libra Excitement      In a press statement, Libra Vice Chairman Dante Disparte said the three additions ""show our commitment to building a diverse group of organizations that will contribute to the governance, technological roadmap and launch readiness of the Libra payment system.”      Libra did not respond to questions concerning the weight of investment firms on its council.      The consortium initially hoped to onboard 100 members by the first half of 2020, its original target launch date. Those plans were derailed by regulators whose criticism set off a hemorrhage of founding members and delayed the launch.      In response, Libra pared back its vision and has slowly begun to replenish its ranks. Last week, it added a CEO with a background in institutional banking and government finance.      UPDATE (May 14, 00:45 UTC): An earlier version of this article referred to Temasek as a sovereign wealth fund (SWF), as it is frequently described in the financial media. However, a spokesperson for Temasek said it operates independently and owns its assets, and hence does not meet the definition. An editing error was to blame.

42383751,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9yKh5,1589492605,Blockchain Bites: Will Enterprise Blockchain Find a 'Killer App' or Be Killed?,"Top Shelf    It seems like enterprise blockchain is between finding its “killer app” and being killed.      “Everyone had a killer app three years ago. That was the state of blockchain business,” Shyam Nagarajan, a director at IBM, said during a marathon session at Consensus: Distributed. “People have wisened up since then.”      There are a number of roadblocks obstructing the possibility of adoption and successful implementation of business-grade blockchain. Cited most frequently is the problem with scalability.      It turns out, it’s difficult to get other people or competing companies to join onto someone else’s private network, CoinDesk’s Ian Allison reported Thursday.      Sometimes this is the result of the market itself. Microsoft’s Riccardo Trubiani pointed out the total size of the Italian blockchain industry is 30 million euro. “Market opportunities define where people will invest,” he said.      But enterprise blockchain isn’t dead, yet. It’s a developing industry, with a learning curve.      Take We.Trade, the first enterprise-grade distributed trade financing platform. In a candidate appraisal of his firm’s performance, General Manager Ciaran McGowan said the firm has been going through growing pains.      Nearly everything that could have gone wrong, did. McGowan said the firm didn’t have the right governance structure – “plenty of ideas and talk, but no action” – infrastructure, or communications initially. The firm also over engineered its platform, building “a Ferrari,” McGowan said, while underdelivering on its compliance requirements – making it impossible for merchants or banks to feel comfortable signing on.      After a period of reorganization, (McGowan replaced the firm’s first Chief Operating Officer Roberto Mancone) We.Trade has its foundations in place, and is on the pathway to profitability, he said.      While McGowan is comfortable with the value proposition of blockchain for trade financing, there are other industry use cases where it simply doesn’t make sense. “The less we can talk purely about blockchain and solving problems with business leaders, the better off we are,” Linda Pawczuk, global head of blockchain and digital assets at Deloitte, said in a separate program.      As the industry matures, it’s likely there will be greater consolidations and collaboration between former competitors.    The CoinDesk 50    The CoinDesk 50 is an annual list celebrating the most important organizations in crypto. We've been announcing five nominees per day, and have highlighted Binance, Cosmos, Brave, Bitmain, MakerDAO, Besu and the People’s Bank of China as particularly noteworthy. Today we honor Silvergate Bank. You can read the full list here.      Silvergate, the Bank That Wasn't Afraid Crypto’s first IPO was a 30-year-old bank. Southern California’s Silvergate Bank, which went public in November 2019, is one of just a handful in the U.S. willing to bank cryptocurrency firms. It was also one of the first, entering the space in 2013, a period when the bank was loaning more than it had on hand. Capital-rich crypto firms needing a place to deposit their fiat in some sense, saved the bank. Silvergate aims to stay ahead of its competition, which now includes JPMorgan, by creating new products and services that clients request. Its Silvergate Exchange Network allows customers to instantly move dollars between different crypto exchanges, and the bank is also piloting new features like bitcoin margin lending.

Consensus Magazine    Generation Crypto Freelance journalist Jess Klein writes about an emerging psychographic of people who see the world through the lens of decentralization. In a series of eight profiles, Klein examines “Generation Crypto,” a diffuse grouping of people of all ages, races and sexes, bound together as “children of Satoshi.”      This excerpt taken from the series follows Preston Byrne, the libertarian lawyer. Read the full series here.      “I’d say not all crypto people are into libertarianism, but most libertarians are into crypto,” says Preston Byrne, a conventional-looking lawyer in his thirties.      A partner at the Anderson Kill law firm as of March 1, his specialty, as it has been for years, is “understanding the nuances” of blockchain technology. He’d only just moved from Connecticut to Washington, D.C. to start at the firm on March 14 when work-from-home orders came through, so he high-tailed it back to Connecticut, where he’d already had a bunch of food stored in his mom’s freezer in case of this exact scenario.      “Those of us who were paying close attention began getting ready for this,” he says, citing a “conspiratorial” article he discovered back in February. Later banned by Twitter, the article suggested the coronavirus came from a Chinese bioweapons lab. “Is that true? I don’t know…but that was an alternative media outlet focused very, very early [on the] outbreak in China,” Byrne says.      Anti-censorship is one of the main reasons Byrne is drawn to blockchain and cryptocurrency. “Bitcoin doesn’t care what we’re using it for,” he says, pointing out it’s been a reliable alternative for those banned from establishment payment systems for political reasons, like Alex Jones and Laura Loomer. At work, he’s dealt with such cases where bitcoin has come to the aid of those “booted” from online platforms (but as an attorney, he can’t discuss them — nor can he hold cryptocurrency himself, due to potential conflicts of interest).      Since he holds no cryptocurrency, Byrne hasn’t gotten too deeply involved in any individual crypto community, but he goes to various Bitcoin and Ethereum meetups. His real “tribe,” however, is the libertarian activist members of the New Hampshire Free State Project. “They were among the earliest adopters of bitcoin at various events they held,” Byrne says. The group’s aim, as he puts it, is to overwhelm New Hampshire’s population with enough libertarians to influence the state’s politics.      Byrne’s libertarian views have only been “validated” by both the government and human response to COVID-19 in the U.S. Since the government didn’t prepare people for the pandemic in time, those who didn’t make the decision to prep for themselves were the ones standing in long lines at the grocery store and panic-buying all the toilet paper. “This really makes the libertarian case,” he says, “because our world fell apart all around us, and the only thing that really mattered was whether you yourself were ready.”      Because of the government’s poor handling of the crisis, Byrne believes more people will want to “exit the system,” he says. “I think bitcoin is one of those exit pathways.”    Money Reimagined    Is bitcoin the answer for a global monetary system not longer served by the dollar standard?

42383729,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9yKJB,1589490995,Aggrieved Investors Mull Suing Telegram Over Canceled TON Blockchain Project,"Investors in Telegram’s TON project are in discussion to sue the company after it abruptly shuttered the blockchain effort earlier this week, according to four individuals familiar with the situation.      It’s not the ambitious project being shut down that upset investors but the options they were given: Take back 72% of their investment immediately, in accordance with a contract amendment from 2019, or loan the funds to Telegram for a year and get back 110% in April 2021.      Telegram spent $405 million from the $1.7 billion token sale proceeds developing both TON blockchain and its messaging app, but those expenditures brought zero value to the investors, said Vladimir Smerkis, head of crypto startup Tokenbox and one of the investors.      “We are considering filing a lawsuit, as the money [Telegram CEO] Pavel Durov spent on the project got investors nothing, while at least, it would be fair to talk about getting Telegram’s equity, for example,” Smerkis said.      In his estimation, about a half of the investors might be considering lawsuits at the moment, and about half as many will actually do it. Three other individuals who did not wish to be named, including another investor in TON and two funds who consulted with such investors, said potential litigation is being actively discussed.      CoinDesk reached out to Telegram for comment on the potential lawsuits and comments by a former employee about the company’s financial status but did not hear back by press time.      “There are funds that are considering a class action against Telegram,” one of the investors told CoinDesk, though he said he does not plan to participate.      Investors in the U.S., Europe and Russia are now discussing these potential lawsuits, he said.      “Many people are upset that the project is over. Knowing Durov’s business acumen, we hoped he would fight for the existence of TON, but apparently the risks he faced exceeded the upside he could get if the project was launched,” Smerkis added.      There was a group of investors that “said they will be with Durov until the end,” Smerkis said. However, the end was announced earlier this week by Durov himself. “On the conference calls with other investors, I can see that people are unhappy and are planning to get their money back and later sue in order to either get more money back or some of [Telegram’s] assets,” Smerkis said.    Quitting it    The fate of TON had been hanging by a thread since Telegram lost in federal court to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which said its planned blockchain tokens, called grams, were unregistered securities. On Wednesday, the story came to a dramatic end: Durov, in an announcement, said the project is over.      “For the last 2.5 years, some of our best engineers have been working on a next-generation blockchain platform called TON and a cryptocurrency we were going to name Gram,” Durov said, but “a U.S. court stopped TON from happening.”      Blaming the U.S. regulators, which can “shut down any bank or bank account in the world” or “use its control over Apple and Google to remove apps from the App Store and Google Play,” Durov announced Telegram will stop developing TON.      Some investors have already received 72% of their initial investments under option one and have no plans to make Telegram’s life any harder. Two of these investors, including Anatoly Knyazev, executive director of the investment firm Exante, confirmed to CoinDesk their refunds had been received.      “It was a venture investment, we fixed our loss,” Knyazev said.      Another investor, BitScale Capital founder Zurab Kazhiloti, said he took the second option and loaned the money to Telegram to see what happens.      “We can wait one more year. Pavel’s team has got us surprises before, so we believe in a positive outcome,” Kazhiloti said.      His optimism goes even further than that because Bitscale Capital joined the community launch of a network based on the TON code, named Free TON, as a validator, he said.      “We all are grateful to Nikolai Durov [Telegram’s CTO and Pavel’s brother] for the code he wrote. Not to launch it would be unreasonable,” Kazhiloti said, adding he hopes the network can attract many validators, services and users in future.      Not everyone feels that uplifted. The head of a venture fund located in Eastern Europe consulted by some TON investors and who asked not to be identified, said investors in America and other regions believe getting back 72% of their investments does not make a “ton” of sense.      “No venture fund wants to wait two years and then get back 72%. It’s better to lose the money altogether,” this person said.      The trust between Durov and Telegram’s investors can be seriously eroded, he added, because the company has been unpredictable in its decision-making and lacks clear two-way communication with itsinvestors.      Some investors were especially insulted that Telegram did not offer them equity after they effectively funded the company’s messenger app, the fund manager said. Durov said during a court deposition that Telegram did not separate the resources it spent on the app from the ones it spent on the blockchain project.      “They showed the investors their place: They don’t want all those various gram purchasers to become shareholders,” the fund manager said. “And it’s disrespectful. You take money from these people but you share the upside with others. You’re spending your investors’ money. Won’t you consider their interest?”      The launch of Free TON also didn’t look good to many investors. Hinting on the possibility that Telegram might have given a green light to the project, the managing partner of Mindrock Capital investment firm Pavel Cherkashin wrote an op-ed in the Russian version of Forbes.      “Investors would support a crusade against the American justice system,” Cherkashin wrote. “What they were not ready for was that Durov would yell “Every man for himself,” jump ship and launch Free TON, repeating the same trick Vkontakte did,” he added, pointing out that Durov’s team started working on the Telegram messenger while employed by his first company, Vkontakte, which caused a conflict among the shareholders.    Equity hopes    According to the fund manager, some investors are still hoping to negotiate an equity deal, but it’s not clear what the value of such equity would be (Durov has publicly rejected both subscription and advertising revenue models and had been funding Telegram out of his own pocket before the token sale).      Yakov Barinsky, CEO of HASH CIB, an investment firm consulted by gram purchasers, told CoinDesk some investors had been expecting to turn their token allocations into shares in Telegram from the start, and they are not planning to let those expectations go.      “There is a group of investors who believe they deserve equity, and they are going to fight for it,” Barinsky said.      Part of this fight might be taking money back now, he added. “Those with the most aggressive attitude believe if they take the loan offer, they will effectively lose the right to negotiate with Telegram based on the current agreement as they enter a new one.”      Pavel Durov has famously been unwilling to dilute his ownership of Telegram, and, according to company spokesperson Remi Vaughn, an equity distribution is definitely not on the table now. However, recent weeks show investors can apply enough pressure to influence Telegram’s strategy at least partly.      After the first refund-or-loan offer was circulated, Telegram detailed new loan terms in an email on May 6. Investors would receive 72% of funds plus interest when Telegram repaid them sometime over the coming year, rather than the 110% previously agreed to. The company walked back these terms after pushback from the community, according to the investors.      Anton Rosenberg, a former Telegram employee fired by Durov, said that if Durov has to return all the money he raised, Telegram will have no funds for its operations.      “Telegram was running out of money in 2017 already, so the last two years it has been spending the TON investors’ funds,” he said.      Now, with the pandemic and the global crisis, it will be quite hard to find an investor willing to buy Telegram, said Rosenberg.      “Some investors are even discussing if Durov can just run away with the money – more as a joke, of course. And some are trying to figure out the chances to get back the entire investment amount via the court,” he said.      A fund manager familiar with the TON investors in the U.S. told CoinDesk several investors were definitely preparing to take on Telegram in court.      “Not sure that they will win. But it is America, so I am sure that they will sue!” he said.

42383752,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9yKeZ,1589489358,Market Wrap: Bitcoin's Price Up 12% Since the Halving,"Bitcoin has seen steady gains in price since the halving took place on May 11. The number of institutional investors trading in the CME crypto options market is a sign of continued interest in this asset class.      At press time, bitcoin's price has risen 12% since the reward for bitcoin miners was cut in half.      Over the past 24 hours, bitcoin (BTC) was trading up 6% at $9,689. The world’s first cryptocurrency is chugging higher, with technical indicators including the 10-day and 50-day moving averages above bullish levels since May 13.      Mark Warner, head of trading for crypto brokerage BCB group, told CoinDesk the price gain is due to continual interest in bitcoin as an asset class, and that the uncertain future faced by miners will take time to shake out.      “Broadly speaking, we expect demand for bitcoin to continue growing incrementally and it will take some time for the supply shock to work its way through the market and be reflected in price,” he said.      Read more: Fund Manager Got NY BitLicense 11 Months After Hiring Its Architect      Bitcoin options open interest on CME, or the total number of outstanding contracts, have spiked since May 5, a sign of institutional interest. On Thursday, options open interest reached a high of $105 million, a huge jump considering average daily interest has been a paltry $13 million since Jan. 13 when first launched on CME.      Trading on the CME is generally done by well-capitalized investors with experience trading derivatives. The rise in open interest is likely coming from that subset of the market, said Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5. “Whoever is behind these purchases is clearly a sophisticated trader,” he said.      The bitcoin activity uptick on the CME is from traders making bullish bets, says Shah. “The interest is in higher strikes, like May at $10,500 is a popular one,” he said. “There's a fair chance these are buyers of calls. Interestingly, $10,500 is a key level on the BTC chart, and a move through there is expected to bring some fireworks. It's no surprise then that the focus is on those strikes.”      Read more: Popular BTC Derivatives Product Goes Live on DeFi’s dYdX      A call gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy a specified amount of an underlying asset at a specified price within a specified time.      Prior to the halving, bitcoin briefly broke through the $10,000 barrier. Shah isn’t the only trader predicting another run to that level and perhaps beyond. An uncertain economic outlook is one reason why Henrik Kugelberg, a Sweden-based over-the-counter trader, thinks that will happen.      “Bitcoin, in my opinion, is undervalued and the [coronavirus] pandemic is very young still,” Kugelberg told CoinDesk. “The upwards line will continue for a good two months, but the ride will be bumpy.”    Other markets    Digital assets on CoinDesk’s big board are mostly in the green on Thursday. Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, gained 3.2% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Cryptocurrency gainers include iota (IOTA) climbing 6.2%, dogecoin (DOGE) being a good boy and in the green by 3.2% and nem (XEM), also up 3.2%. Losers in 24-hour trading include lisk (LSK), losing 2.5%, cardano (ADA) in the red 1.2%. and stellar (XLM) losing 1%. All price changes were as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET) Thursday.

42383714,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9yEkT,1589479309,Copper Claims New Tool Removes Credit Risk From Crypto Trading,"Infrastructure provider Copper claims its new trading tool solves an obstacle preventing institutional investors from trading more freely in the cryptocurrency space by letting two parties hold on to their assets until just before executing a trade.      The London-based firm said Thursday that ClearLoop – which facilitates fast, off-exchange settlements – would pretty much negate one of the chief concerns institutional investors have with the crypto space: namely, the risk involved with trusting an exchange to look after their trading capital.      Most exchanges require clients to deposit digital assets with them, in a hot wallet, before they'll allow them to trade. While this is usually not a problem, there's always the risk an exchange might get hacked or, in the case of QuadrigaCX, disappear into thin air.      Known as credit risk exposure, this is the same risk factor that caused many financial institutions to bite their nails off during the 2008 financial crash. For institutional investors with more than a passing interest in the crypto space, the problem of having to trust an exchange to look after their capital precludes many of them from depositing and trading as much as they may otherwise like.      ""This is a massive problem in the sector,"" Copper CEO Dmitry Tokarev told CoinDesk. Many funds try to trade on multiple exchanges – 15 in some cases – and generally perform due diligence and full risk assessments before they use a new one.      ""Not only do they not have the capacity to do that assessment, more often than not it's not the investors' field [so] it's hard for them to do it in the first place,"" he said. He quoted one of Copper's clients who claimed credit risk exposure was almost always the main concern investors had with the cryptocurrency space.      See also: London-Based Crypto Custodian Copper Raises $8M for Expansion Overseas      What ClearLoop does is remove this trust element from exchanges. Clients hold their trading capital themselves, either in a cold wallet or custodial solution, while they initialize a trade with an interested party. It's only at the last moment, once the trade has actually been completed, that ClearLoop transfers digital assets from the client onto the exchange and then into the buyer's possession.      Not only does this keep the time the exchange holds a digital asset to an absolute minimum, it radically speeds the trading process. Copper claims ClearLoop takes transaction times down to about 100 milliseconds – about the same as a blink of an eye. Usually, it can sometimes take up to an hour for an exchange to just register a deposit in the first place.      See also: Investors Can Hedge Long-Term Risk With New 2-Year Bitcoin Derivatives      ClearLoop officially went live Thursday following a few weeks in beta. So far six exchanges have integrated it into their trading platforms including Bitfinex, DeversiFI and options exchange Deribit. In a statement, Deribit co-founder and CEO John Jansen said the trading tool would""reduce risk significantly and will improve the way asset managers trade and manage capital.""      Tokarev said faster settlement capabilities on multiple exchanges would also create many new opportunities for arbitrageurs. ""If you see an opportunity between two exchanges, you deploy the capital and you collapse that basically instantly, in milliseconds,"" he said.      He added that a handful of high-frequency trading firms have expressed interest in ClearLoop because it enables them to execute the same strategies they use in traditional assets for crypto.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/14/copper-claims-new-tool-removes-credit-risk-from-crypto-trading,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8e3be26a04c7befdecb7ee2be9b9465e5bc4693e-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

With several services and pools of liquidity under one roof, Bequant is able to help institutional clients trade and expand their portfolios while keeping transaction costs low. Additional services include collateral management tools, smart order routing, leveraged trade execution and over-the-counter (OTC) block trading.      “We are tailored to a lot of quant [hedge funds] and our clients typically look at trading through automated strategies, arbitrage, you name it,” Bequant CEO George Zarya said. “What they require is … one account to access liquidity pools, manage collateral and gain access to lending.”      Read more: New York Grants Its 18th BitLicense to Crypto ‘Prime Broker’ Tagomi      In traditional finance, prime brokerage refers to a bundle of specialized services offered by investment banks and securities dealers to their hedge fund clients. There are few prime brokers in the crypto space, but Bequant’s largest competitor is Tagomi, a New York-based prime broker that became the 22nd member of Facebook’s Libra Association earlier this year.      Crypto exchanges such as Gibraltar-based Huobi offer their own brokerage services as an additional service for institutional investors, but it’s still rare to find companies that offer a full range of prime brokerage tools.

With the Aldebaran testnet, the security token issuer is implementing a relatively new type of protocol scheme known as nominated proof-of-stake (NPoS), which the firm says brings ""absolute transaction finality,"" a factor ""crucial"" for the trading of blockchain-based securities.      With a launch date now slated for June 23, according to an announcement on Thursday, Aldebaran will allow testing of the permissioned chain, which aims to be an additional security layer allowing specific actions to be performed by identifiable participants on the network.      See also: Polymath, SeriesOne Team Up to Simplify Security Token Issuance      “Aldebaran is a major milestone and accomplishment,” Thomas Borrel, chief product officer at Polymath, said in a press release. “A year ago, we built an aggressive roadmap to deliver the capabilities required to satisfy regulators and institutions and give everyone equal access to economic growth.”      Polymesh on Aldebaran will address four “areas of concern” for financial firms dealing with blockchain securities: governance, including removing the legal complexities of blockchain forks; ensuring all parties have passed due-diligence checks; allowing users and trading data to remain private; and using automation to ensure regulatory compliance.      The testnet marks the first iteration of the new blockchain – first announced by co-founder Trevor Koverko at CoinDesk’s Consensus in 2019 – allowing it to be put through its paces and receive early feedback. It will also help the company build collaborations, Borrel noted.      See also: Overstock Files to Dismiss ‘Meritless’ Fraud Lawsuit Over Its Digital Dividend      Polymath's existing platform has already been used to tokenize $2.2 billion in real estate by commercial property marketplace Red Swan, as reported in February.

42383713,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9yEhx,1589469966,Staying Alive: Why the World of Enterprise Blockchain Has Turned to Collaborations,"Enterprise blockchain isn’t dead, but survival has meant more collaboration and some smart pivots.      That was the prevailing sentiment in the enterprise-focused corners of this week’s Consensus: Distributed conference.      Back in 2015, a large amount of hype was generated as whole industries, starting with finance, began espousing the technology behind bitcoin, which would transform business processes and herald a global technological upgrade.      A recalibration of expectation followed as the technology entered Gartner’s infamous trough of disillusionment. There was also a narrowing down of the space into three quite separate enterprise-focused blockchain networks: R3 Corda, Hyperledger and enterprise Ethereum.      But these days, we are starting to see players putting their tribal instincts aside – often by necessity.      For instance, Kaleido, the blockchain cloud service backed by ConsenSys, revealed a partnership Tuesday with R3 to run on the latter’s Corda network. Enterprise Ethereum and R3 Corda have always been rivals and such a collaboration would have been unthinkable a year ago. (Tuesday’s reporting also revealed Kaleido had been spun out of the ConsenSys mothership in early April.)      Read more: R3 Corda Partners With Kaleido After Ethereum Startup Spins Out of ConsenSys      It’s no secret ConsenSys has been undergoing cuts, including being forced to shutter operations in the Philippines late last year. That’s where Kaleido was involved in the i2i payments and remittance project with UnionBank.      R3 does not miss an opportunity and could now be in the frame to poach the i2i project from Ethereum. Asked if this was the plan during a workshop at Consensus: Distributed, R3 co-founder Todd MacDonald admitted he liked the i2i project but would not be drawn further.      Kaleido CEO Steve Cerveny went on to say the i2i project was “alive and well.”    The successful pivot    Interoperability is a concept often spoken of as though it’s a mountain top on some distant horizon.      However, Hyperledger, the Linux Foundation’s blockchain factory, announced this week a new “DLT integration protocol” called Cactus, a pluggable way of connecting multiple blockchain ledgers, including Hyperledger Besu, Hyperledger Fabric, Corda and Quorum.      Hyperledger Executive Director Brian Behlendorf commented that smaller firms might do better by switching away from building their own ledgers and focus instead on creating software that will run across other blockchains.      Read more: CoinDesk 50: Besu, the Marriage of Ethereum and Hyperledger      Take a lesson from seminal blockchain firm Digital Asset, Behlendorf said, which has successfully pivoted with the DAML smart contract language that runs across multiple systems.      “I suspect a lot of these companies, especially the smaller ones that are less flush with cash – and frankly who isn’t these days – will probably follow moves like Digital Asset has made,” Behlendorf said in an interview.      A similar approach has been taken by Skuchain, as an early player in the trade finance blockchain space. Skuchain has teamed up with the Bankers Association for Finance and Trade (BAFT) to create a new digital standard, the Distributed Ledger Payment Commitment (DLPC). The new DLPC standard is now finding its feet on Corda following a deal with R3 last month.      Skuchain was on a panel at Consensus to showcase some $50 million worth of COVID-19 relief PPE consignments to the U.S. that have been shunted across its platform with HSBC. Asked if this meant Skuchain was now interoperating with R3’s other trade finance networks such as the multi-bank consortium Marco Polo, Skuchain founder Srinivasan Sriram said, “Not quite yet.”    Mastercard and Libra    Mastercard was also at Consensus, showing off its own enterprise blockchain chops and exploring ways to leverage its vast reach into the retail sector. The card company’s blockchain bid: a food track-and-trace platform built by Envisible and Wholechain.      Mastercard spun up its own blockchain solution rather than use something from Hyperledger or a variation of Ethereum, demonstrating a retrenchment towards more of a “can do” attitude.      On the subject of leaving the Libra Association last October, Mastercard Labs EVP Ken Moore said the company “is keeping a close eye” on the progress of the Libra project as it enters a new phase of regulatory appeasement.      “We just have to be careful how our brand is perceived by global regulators,” Moore said, suggesting that rejoining Libra was not out of the question.    Salesforce monopoly    Other enterprise highlights at Consensus included the pairing of platform giant Salesforce with platform giant killer Dfinity.      Dfinity CEO Dominic Williams wants to tear up the enterprise playbook and start over with an Internet Computer protocol, reminiscent of the early “world computer” ambitions of the Ethereum Foundation.      Dfinity, which created in January an open version of LinkedIn called LinkedUp, has also been engineering “Sales Machine,” a completely decentralized version of Salesforce – a company Williams referred to as a “ravenous monopoly.”      Adam Caplan, Salesforce’s blockchain and emerging technology lead, kept a cool head, saying the tech giant was sticking to its mission of innovating on behalf of its 150,000 customers.      Also looking to shake up big business: John Wolpert of ConsenSys and Paul Brody of EY’s interesting Baseline protocol, which uses the public Ethereum blockchain as an immutable shared record of big companies’ procurement efforts.      Brody pointed out that enterprise blockchains have not scaled well because nobody wants to join someone else’s private network. Most enterprise blockchain efforts have an average of 1.5 members, he said.

42383707,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9yEaP,1589468021,Telegram's TON Was Built on Sand. Its Failure Isn't All Bad For Crypto,"Preston Byrne, a columnist for CoinDesk’s Opinion section, is a partner in Anderson Kill’s Technology, Media and Distributed Systems Group. He advises software, internet and fintech companies. His biweekly column, “Not Legal Advice,” is a roundup of pertinent legal topics in the crypto space. It is most definitely not legal advice.      Two weeks ago, this column focused on Telegram’s litigation with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In that column, I argued Telegram’s TON and Kik’s kin strike me as not serving any functionality other than being a money substitute and an investment vehicle. Whether this is legally the case will depend on the outcome of the litigation. The SAFT structure used by Telegram to distribute its coins, “once regarded as compliance best practice in the cryptocurrency industry, will be greatly diminished in its usefulness in the U.S.”      We learn this week, not from a court filing but a blog post, that Telegram’s foray into the cryptocurrency world is finally over.      By way of background, the Telegram Open Network, or TON, was first announced in December 2017 during the peak of a truly insane bitcoin bull run that started with a single bitcoin costing around $1,000 and ended, in December 2017, with 1 BTC priced at nearly $20,000. Seeking to cash in, token issuers around the world began selling their own offerings into this rising market.      In late July of that year, the SEC published a paper, the “DAO Report of Investigation,” in which it said the sale of tokens directly to the public by that scheme (in 2015) likely constituted a securities offering, although it declined to take further action against the DAO and its promoters for these violations.      See also: With Kik and Telegram Cases, the SEC Tries to Kill the SAFT      As a result, the market understood that, in the SEC’s view, most direct sales of pre-mined tokens to investors were also likely to constitute, and be regulated as, securities offerings. This was an earthquake in the cryptocurrency world that, at least up to that point, had no formal confirmation the SEC regarded so-called “initial coin offerings” as falling under its jurisdiction.      As a result, the law firm Cooley and hot crypto startup Protocol Labs developed a type of contract, known as the “Simple Agreement for Future Tokens” (SAFT). Essentially this is a forward contract allowing new projects to sell tokens to “accredited investors” in the U.S. pursuant to a private placement exemption. The theory around tokens sold in accordance with SAFT says that while prior to a network’s launch a contract for tokens that did not yet exist was not a security, the existence of a fully functional production blockchain network serving some useful purpose would allow the tokens transmitted thereon to not be considered an investment contract. In other words, it would be something akin to a software license.    Genuine technological progress that expands cryptocurrencies’ user base organically will become more important for adoption    In true crypto fashion, a white paper was published, template documents were released and blockchain projects everywhere began using the new SAFT instrument to raise funds in the private markets. Telegram’s TON network was one such project.      At the time, Telegram was a fast-growing, encrypted WhatsApp competitor popular in crypto circles (it still is, although one could argue it has been surpassed by Signal and Keybase among crypto diehards). It was also founded by Pavel Durov, the founder of “Russian Facebook” VK.      Accordingly, it ticked a lot of boxes for U.S. investment funds. Consequently, in the space of a few months, Telegram’s (pre-product, pre-revenue) investment round saw investors subscribe to a truly staggering $1.7 billion in SAFT notes – a sum larger than the GDP of Vanuatu, St. Kitts and Nevis or Grenada – and far more than is required to develop a blockchain network’s beta release.      See also: Telegram Abandons TON Blockchain Project After Court Fight With SEC      The SEC, and ultimately a federal judge in the Southern District of New York, disapproved of Telegram’s approach to coin distribution and argued both the initial sale of SAFTs and the planned onward distribution of TON coins, known as “grams,” to public markets in the United States were, in effect, one and the same transaction and could not be bifurcated into a pre-launch, regulated investment contract and a post-launch, unregulated utility coin.      It was in this context we learned Telegram, after a brief, token (pun intended) show of defiance in the form of a proposed restructuring, is throwing in the towel. Telegram CEO Pavel Durov wrote:    Imagine that several people put their money together to build a gold mine – and to later split the gold that comes out of it. Then a judge comes and tells the mine builders:Many people invested in the gold mine because they were looking for profits. And they didn't want that gold for themselves, they wanted to sell it to other people. Because of this, you are not allowed to give them the gold.If this doesn't make sense to you, you are not alone – but this is exactly what happened with TON (the mine), its investors and grams (the gold). A judge used this reasoning to rule that people should not be allowed to buy or sell grams like they can buy or sell bitcoins.    Of course, U.S. law regulates pooled investments into gold mines such as those Durov describes, and has for the better part of 70 years, and at least ever since SEC v. W.J. Howey, Co. was decided in 1946 (creating the eponymous Howey test that determines whether securities laws apply to a sale of investable assets).      Durov’s parting shot criticizing the SEC concedes what most of us knew all along, and one of the limbs of the SEC’s case. It also contradicts Telegram’s own marketing at all times from 2017 until this week. See, e.g., a legal notice dated Jan. 6 of this year that states users “should NOT expect any profits based on your purchase or holding of grams,” and “Grams are intended to act as a medium of exchange… there should be NO expectation of future profit or gain from the purchase, sale, or holding of grams.”    Durov’s parting shot criticizing the SEC concedes what most of us knew all along, and one of the limbs of the SEC’s case    Durov’s blog post frames Telegram’s decision to call it quits in grandiose terms of a conflict between ossified and repressive state institutions of the past and a bold decentralized future. “You are fighting the right battle,” he writes, adding, “This battle may well be the most important battle of our generation. We hope that you succeed where we have failed.”      The reality, legally speaking, is a little more mundane.      The SEC’s regulatory perimeter is not infinite. It does not regulate Github repositories, decentralized cryptocurrencies or bitcoin, in the latter case at least if various public statements made by the SEC and its senior officials are to be believed. The SEC and equivalent state laws regulate securities, investment contracts and otherwise uncategorized investment schemes, generally speaking. Although we now know pre-selling tokens to investors in the U.S. is unlikely to pass regulatory muster in way that is practical for the ordinary cryptocurrency user, we also know that properly structured, proof-of-work releases of coins can potentially be done in a regulatory compliant fashion, with Bitcoin as our lodestar.      The fact that dev teams cannot raise vast quantities of funding upfront does not mean we in America can’t have a crypto ecosystem. It simply means we will have a different one than crypto investment funds and thought leaders expected, one where small, random projects will compete on equal terms with institutional players and well-capitalized companies that are now unable to pre-fund their products’ dominance.      Genuine technological progress that expands cryptocurrencies’ user base organically will become more important for adoption than a company’s fundraising ability or ability to airdrop vast quantities of coins on unsuspecting users of otherwise unrelated applications (see: Stellar and Keybase).

Consensus Magazine    Generation Crypto Freelance journalist Jess Klein writes about an emerging psychographic of people who see the world through the lens of decentralization. In a series of eight profiles, Klein examines “Generation Crypto,” a diffuse grouping of people of all ages, races and sexes, bound together as “children of Satoshi.”      SpankChain's Ameen Soleimani is the subject of this excerpted profile. Read the full series here.      It was only February when the founder of the blockchain sex worker platform SpankChain, Ameen Soleimani, helped throw a coronavirus-themed party at an Airbnb-ed church during the ETHDenver conference in Colorado – drinking Corona beers with his “shitcoin trading friends, protocol developers, and bitcoin OGs” – but it feels like a lifetime ago.      It was weeks before several of the conference’s attendees went on to EthCC in Paris and got infected with the coronavirus, and one week before Soleimani convinced his mom to take a mass shopping trip to Costco to prepare for a lockdown in California that hadn’t started yet. “I probably could have done more to raise awareness and make people take it seriously,” he says of the church party.      But still, he was prepared. In addition to the Costco trip, he stockpiled drugs including chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine – both under testing to see how effective they could be in treating COVID-19 patients, though the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has cautioned against using them at home – and even bought an oxygen tank. “On the off-chance my mom is dying of coronavirus … I’d rather have an oxygen concentrator than $400,” he reasons.      A couple months out from moving out of the apartment he’d shared with SpankChain co-Founder Wills de Vogelaere in Los Angeles’s Venice Beach, Soleimani has been isolating at an Ethereum friend’s mansion in West Hollywood. The friend isn’t there – it’s just Soleimani, two other friends, a heated pool and a steam room. “I sort of hit the quarantine jackpot,” he says.      Like many others in his industry, Soleimani was able to prepare so thoroughly thanks to a combination of a global network and shared prepper mentalities. “I’ve been in a Telegram ‘Doomsday Prepper’ group for, like, a month and a half,” he says, where members share “raw feeds from doctors’ Twitters” and the like. “It turns out to be better intel, a lot of the time, than if you listen to the World Health Organization.”      Being a young entrepreneur in the crypto space generally means avoiding the establishment ethos for a more progressive outlook. For instance, Soleimani posted his first porn video to PornHub back in January. Starring him and SpankChain adviser/adult film star Brenna Sparks, it features the pair “role playing” as themselves (a boss hooking up with his sexy adviser). It took a year for Soleimani to muster the courage to post it online but he has no regrets – it’s helping normalize the stigmatized industry his company operates in, he figures.      “The old guard is like: He’s ruined his career, he’s fucked, nobody will take him seriously,” says Soleimani. Meanwhile, younger people in the space found the move iconic and admirable.      Soleimani sees this divide as indicative of business culture moving forward, particularly in the crypto space. “Eventually the old people will die, the rules will go with them and newer generations will set the cultural norms,” he said in February. “As entrepreneurs, it’s part of our role to bring those new concepts into the world.”      In light of the pandemic, this makes for an exceptionally bleak and insensitive take. But in a world where people are only dressing from the waist up for conference calls, rolling with changing cultural norms has become inevitable.

42383708,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9yEbf,1589462659,"Industry Group Led by Polychain, Coinbase Seeks to Get Ahead on Staking Regulations","The Proof of Stake Alliance (POSA), an industry advocacy group, is publishing a series of recommended standards for companies participating in a proof-of-stake consensus protocol in an effort to reduce regulatory clampdowns on different networks.      The group met with members of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this year to discuss their proposals and discuss staking more broadly, as well as submit a white paper detailing the industry recommendations. The alliance includes Bison Trails, Coinbase, Polychain, Tezos and the Cardano Foundation, among others.      “We’re coming out with some industry-driven solutions around staking as a service which we believe will really help push the ecosystem forward and ensure that staking as a service and staking can grow in the U.S. without being subject to some regulatory landmines and hurdle,” said Evan Weiss, the group’s founder.      Weiss, who is also chief of staff at Bison Trails, said the idea is entities that stake networks can be seen as service or infrastructure providers, rather than financial product providers.      The recommendations shared with the SEC are essentially:    Don’t provide investment advice to market participants  Don’t call staking rewards “a profit opportunity”  Focus advertising on network participation and security  Don’t indicate the service provider has control over inflation rate  Don’t provide guarantees on staking rewards    “I do think [with] these networks, we are very clearly seeing that the technology underlying them is very powerful and I see it having an impact, maybe not in the next few months but in the next year or two,” Weiss said.      The group used Tezos and Cosmos as two examples of proof-of-stake networks that are already live, he said, with questions focusing on how they work.      See also: Coinbase Custody to Support Polkadot Staking With up to 20% Returns      Polkadot and NuCypher are another set of networks that haven’t quite launched yet, but which the group hopes to use as examples.      “As they start launching we’re hoping to continue engaging with the SEC,” Weiss said. “They want to be smart on this which makes total sense and in my view they’ve been super reasonable about this.    Network, not tokens    Weiss said the group wanted to focus strictly on the operation of a proof-of-stake network, and not necessarily on the tokens that might be built on them.      “I think we really hope it looks more at looking at the providers as security and infrastructure providers, not financial providers,” he said.      The group wants to remain small and focused on a single issue rather than field questions about whether a given token is a security, he said, adding the alliance would be willing to collaborate with some of the other trade associations in the space as needed to address these types of questions.      “There’s been a lot of amazing work done by the [Chamber of Digital Commerce], the Blockchain Association so for us being a smaller [group] … I don't’ think we’ll be taking the lead here,” he said.      The question of how proof-of-stake networks fit into regulatory regimes is still a broad one. Right now the group is focused on advocacy efforts within the U.S., but Weiss hopes any solutions that fit the U.S. framework will be applicable outside the country as well.      “We’ve kind of taken this approach of being very detailed and so we’ve had a few times that we’ve been really focused on,” he said. “Our thinking is if we can get this right in the U.S. it can work [elsewhere] through ripple effects.”      See also: Kyber to Offer Delegated Token Staking After Coming Network Upgrade      What the group needs now is buy-in from industry stakeholders and for conversations with the regulators to continue, he said.      He also wants to avoid a situation where entities are promoting tokens or a potential repeat of the 2017 initial coin offering market, which in his view “was not a great allocation of resources.”      “A lot of people were hurt by it, so it’s finding a line between people who are really true technologists and making sure the people in the new economy, new interactions have a way to do that,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/05/14/industry-group-led-by-polychain-coinbase-seeks-to-get-ahead-on-staking-regulations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/32bdcc1974cb1fb15d2fcf27d896d4adbbdc1e18-1500x895.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383722,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9yEs1,1589460720,CoinDesk 50: Silvergate – The Bank That Wasn’t Scared,"Crypto’s first IPO was a 30-year-old bank.      Southern California’s Silvergate Bank, which went public in November 2019, is one of just a handful in the U.S. willing to bank cryptocurrency firms. Since November, it’s spent part of the $40 million from its initial public offering to create products to serve the industry as price volatility drives trading volumes and deposits.      Silvergate wants to be the premier bank for crypto, and until Wyoming’s special depository institutions are chartered Silvergate is the only one that has most of its deposit business devoted to the industry.    This post is part of the CoinDesk 50, an annual selection of the most innovative and consequential projects in the blockchain industry. See the full list here.    Founded in La Jolla, in 1988, the bank pivoted to crypto in 2013. At that time, the bank’s loans were growing faster than its deposits and it transitioned to accepting the crypto community’s excess fiat capital, which brings in a stream of non-interest bearing deposits. It then converts these deposits into interest-bearing deposits at other banks, investment securities and loans.      The backstory gives Silvergate social capital among crypto companies.      “The bank was among the first U.S. financial institutions to fully embrace the industry,” said Dave Ripley, COO of the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange. “Many U.S.-based crypto companies would have had significantly more difficulty operating without Silvergate’s services.”      Silvergate’s focus on becoming the premier bank for crypto exchanges and institutional investors is reflected in its balance sheet, said KBW analyst Mike Perito. Its risk-based asset ratio – total capital to risk-based assets – is around 26%, compared to 12% to 14% at other banks. Its leverage ratio – or the measure of a bank’s core capital to its total assets – is around 11%, against a more typical (and more risky) 9% or 9.5% at its peers, he said.      This conservatism gave the bank stability during the market crash in March, while it saw deposits and fee income rise after institutional investors dropped more excess cash into their accounts in the first quarter of 2020.    The future of banking crypto    Having moved faster than any other U.S. bank in the space, Silvergate aims to stay ahead by creating products and services clients request.      Through the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN), which allows customers to instantly move dollars between different crypto exchanges and is open even on weekends, the bank is piloting new features such as bitcoin margin lending. The product is called SEN Leverage.      “Their SEN is probably the most useful service that they offer and what sets them apart from every other bank,” said Michael Gilman, manager of treasury at MG Stover, a fund administration firm. “So giving their clients the ability to transact with other blockchain counterparties 24/7 is what separates from the pack.”      Without the SEN, crypto companies would be bound to the Fedwire system on which banks settle transactions.      Silvergate’s clients have also expressed interest in custody and settlement services for bitcoin trades, CEO Alan Lane told CoinDesk after reporting earnings for the fourth quarter of 2019.      Lane said the bank is exploring whether or not it should play a “more active role” in the stablecoin space, beyond just offering basic banking services to stablecoin issuers. When asked about how the Facebook-backed libra might benefit the bank, Ben Reynolds, executive vice president of corporate development, touted Silvergate cash management products that allow for the quick transfer of fiat to stablecoins.      That could mean stablecoin products for larger customers. “If the history of banking tells you anything, people are willing to pay for a higher level of service, especially in the institutional segment,” Perito said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/14/coindesk-50-silvergate-the-bank-that-wasnt-scared,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e8482e8bcfbea046468de7e7218382bdde583f83-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383724,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9yEvn,1589457609,"First Mover: As Fed Swats Down Negative Rates, Bitcoiners Wonder, 'What If'","After bitcoin's much-hyped halving failed to generate a price rally, crypto traders have been turning to a new bullish investment thesis: the possibility the Federal Reserve might cut its benchmark interest rate to below zero.      Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a televised interview Wednesday that negative rates are ""not something that we're looking at."" The remark disappointed U.S. stock traders who were hoping for an easier monetary stance, helping to send the Standard & Poor's 500 down by 1.7% to a three-week low.      You're reading First Mover, CoinDesk's daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      Bitcoin, on the other hand, jumped some 6% on Wednesday to about $9,300. The cryptocurrency has now recovered about half of what it lost in a four-day sell-off through Monday, when bitcoin underwent the third halving in its 11-year history.      Some analysts had predicted the halving, which cut bitcoin's block reward from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC, could send prices to $90,000 or even higher; the anemic price action in the lead-up to the event left some bulls feeling underwhelmed.      But the prospect of negative interest rates might be rekindling traders' spirits – or at least refocusing attention on bitcoin's possible use as a hedge against the inflation that might come from historically easy monetary policy.      Despite Powell's comments, traders in U.S. interest-rate futures on Wednesday continued to bet the Fed might implement negative rates by early next year, according to Reuters. So far, the Fed has relied on monetary-policy actions it used in the 2008 financial crisis, including cutting rates close to zero and injecting trillions of dollars of new money into global markets.      For crypto traders, the new bet is negative interest rates could eventually help push up inflation – reducing the dollar's purchasing power, and thus pushing up the price of bitcoin (BTC) in dollar terms.      ""If rates go negative, more and more people will realize what we already see,"" Omer Ozden, CEO of the blockchain-focused merchant bank RockTree Capital, told First Mover in a Telegram message. ""The risk is not being in BTC. The risk is being in fiat.""      Bitcoin prices are up 30% in 2020, an enviable performance when compared with returns in traditional asset classes. Gold, traditionally seen as an inflation hedge, is up just 13% this year, while the S&P 500 is, coincidentally, also down by 13%.      Since 2014, four major central banks have experimented with negative rates, including the European Central Bank and those of Switzerland, Japan and Sweden.      U.S. President Donald Trump, who has not shied away from using his bully pulpit to pressure the Fed to cut rates, tweeted on Tuesday that ""as long as other countries are receiving the benefits of Negative Rates, the USA should also accept the “GIFT”. Big numbers!""      It goes without saying that looser monetary policy could help stimulate the economy, which would likely help his reelection chances in November.      The whole idea of negative interest rates can be a bit of a head-scratcher, of course.      ""The practice of paying people in order to borrow money flips all financial models on their heads,"" Mati Greenspan, founder of the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency research firm Quantum Economics, told First Mover in an email. ""Suddenly debt becomes something that is coveted and savings become a thing of the past.""      But there's some support among top U.S. economists for the emergency use of negative rates. Narayana Kocherlakota, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, wrote last month for Bloomberg Opinion that U.S. monetary policymakers ""should fight a rapidly deepening recession by taking interest rates below zero.""      In 2016, Carnegie Mellon University economics Professor Marvin Goodfriend argued central banks should consider negative rates as a ""realistic policy option"" in a financial crisis because large-scale balance sheet expansions might lead to ""destructive inflationary finance.""      Ariel Zetlin-Jones, an associate economics professor at Carnegie Mellon, who has conducted research on blockchain networks, said in a phone interview Wednesday that negative rates are a ""tricky issue"" and could prove unpopular because they might cause ""plumbing issues in the banking system.""      Banks might try to pass along the negative rates to depositors, and some customers might accept those, given that recessions tend to be deflationary, he said. A report this week from the U.S. Labor Department showed core consumer prices fell 0.4% in April, a record drop, according to data going back to 1957.      ""Even if banks nominally are charging a slight negative rate, if you think prices are going to continue to fall you're still making money, on average,"" Zetlin-Jones said.      Some savers might simply choose to withdraw their money and hold cash to avoid the negative rates.      ""But that may not be something they want to do,"" Zetlin-Jones said. ""So they might look to send those funds elsewhere, say into bonds that pay some interest or into other speculative asset classes, say into bitcoin.""      Unlike many stocks, bitcoin pays no dividend; unlike bonds, bitcoin pays no coupon.      In that sense, negative rates in the U.S. would reduce the ""opportunity cost of holding non-income producing assets like BTC or gold, potentially making them even more attractive to investors,"" Kevin Kelly, co-founder of the cryptocurrency research firm Delphi Digital, told First Mover in an email.      ""In my opinion, there's a non-zero chance the Fed winds up taking rates below zero, despite Powell's dismissive attitude towards the idea, if current deflationary pressures persist,"" Kelly wrote.      A non-zero chance? With bitcoin's halving now in the past, that might be enough to salvage optimism among the bulls.

As seen on the hourly chart, the entire recovery rally from lows below $8,200 observed earlier this week is accompanied by low buying volumes (small green bars). A low-volume price rise is often short-lived and reversed quickly.      Moreover, the ongoing pullback is backed by an uptick in the sell volume or red bar and looks to have legs. Further, the hourly chart relative strength index has rolled over from overbought or above-70 levels, signaling scope for a deeper decline.      The immediate support is located at $9,418 (horizontal line). A violation there would expose the 200-hour average located at $9,200.      However, if prices hold above $9,600 for the next couple of hours, a fresh move toward $10,000 could be seen. Note that bitcoin balances on cryptocurrency exchanges have slipped to 12-month lows, according to the data provided by the blockchain intelligence firm Glassnode. It indicates a strong holding sentiment.      Also, the daily chart is looking constructive. Prices rose 5% on Wednesday, confirming bullish revival signaled by Tuesday's green inside bar candlestick pattern. An inside bar candlestick occurs when an asset hovers within the trading range of the previous day and is widely considered a sign of indecision in the market place.      Hence, a positive follow-through, similar to the one witnessed on Wednesday, is considered a sign of bullish reversal.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/14/first-mover-as-fed-swats-down-negative-rates-bitcoiners-wonder-what-if,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/41c854d1cad703b69ccc3e34ac189a147fceaeb3-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383723,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9yEtH,1589452953,Bitcoin's Price Has Bounced but Miners May Still Be Switching Off Post-Halving,"While bitcoin is fast reversing its pre-halving price drop, some miners still look to be leaving the network.      At time of writing, the top cryptocurrency by market value is changing hands at $9,730, representing a 20% gain on the low of $8,100 observed Sunday – the day before Bitcoin underwent its third mining reward halving.      The bounce has erased more than 75% of the drop from $10,500 to $8,100 seen in the three days to May 10.      While the price has recovered a major portion of the lost ground, the cryptocurrency’s hashrate (the total computing power dedicated to mining blocks on the blockchain) has declined to 98 exahashes (EH/s) – that's down 27% from the high of 135 EH/s observed on Monday, according to data source bitinfocharts.com.      The one-day hashrate often sees rapid fluctuations and provides less useful information about the broader trend. Hence, most observers prefer the seven-day average of the hashrate, which smooths out daily fluctuations.      Also read: ‘History Has Repeated’: F2Pool Explains Message in Last Block Before Bitcoin Halving      That average, too, has dropped to 114 EH/s from the pre-halving high of 122 EH/s, according to data provided by blockchain intelligence firm Glassnode.      The decline in the hashrate suggests some miners have scaled back or shut down operations following Monday’s halving of block rewards from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC, which makes returning a profit harder or impossible with older mining machines (depending on the price). Validating that argument is the recent uptick in the mean block interval time, or the average time taken to mine a block.      The mean block interval time rose to 727 seconds or 12 minutes on Wednesday from a low of 8.5 minutes observed on Sunday.      The halving was expected to crowd out some miners, especially the ones using older-generation mining devices like Bitmain's Antminer S9s.      While speaking at Consensus: Distributed on Tuesday, Alex de Vries, founder of financial and economic news portal Digiconomist and blockchain specialist, said, ""S9s miners have already lived longer than expected and bitcoin’s price will have to double for these machines to become viable again.”      De Vries also predicted a decline of up to 20% in the hashrate in the short term. So far, the seven-day average has dropped by 6.5%.      However, if prices continue to rise, even the older-generation machines might once more be worth switching on, especially as electricity costs are expected to go down with the arrival of the monsoon season in China’s Sichuan province, a region that contributes over 50% of the total mining power on the Bitcoin network.      But even if prices rise over $13,760, the Antminer S9 would still be operating at a slight loss, according to a calculator provided by Poolin.      Some observers believe the miner capitulation happened during the first half of March when the cryptocurrency's price fell from $9,000 to $3,867. ""We already had a mini halving in March due to the price crash. We don't expect a big drop in the hash rate in the short-term (sic),"" said de Vries on Twitter.      See also: Many Ether Whales Might Be Leaving for Bitcoin: Data      A move above $13,000 looks unlikely right now, though a break above $10,000 cannot be ruled out because bitcoin balances on cryptocurrency exchanges have continued to decline post-halving – a sign of long-term bullish sentiment.

Most of the action around the news took place on Twitter. At just after 16:00 UTC Wednesday, bot Twitter account Whale Alert warned Binance – which has previously committed to freezing any funds stemming from the hack – that roughly 137 ether (worth around $27,000 at press time) had moved from an address linked to the Upbit hacker group to its wallets.      Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao tweeted soon after that the funds had been successfully frozen and the money would shortly be returned to Upbit. The time between hackers transferring the ether to Binance and the exchange blocking the funds was little more than half an hour.      Gone are the days when hackers could simply walk off into the sunset with their loot, as did the person who stole 850,000 bitcoin from Mt. Gox in 2014. Wallet addresses linked to suspected hackers are now tagged, and exchanges usually freeze any funds stemming from these wallets if they arrive on their servers.      In January 2019, Binance also froze funds linked to the $16 million Cryptopia hack.      See also: New Crypto Exchange Altsbit Says It Will Close Following Hack      Of course, it is still possible to launder funds. Something like 3,650 ether (worth roughly $725,000) has left the wallet linked to the Upbit hack in the past 24 hours, much of it passing rapidly through other wallets, likely to try and obfuscate the digital paper trail.      A report from security firm Uppsala earlier this year highlighted the Upbit hackers may have already laundered as much as $3.2 million worth of ether through exchanges, including Binance and Bitfinex, by only pushing tiny amounts through each time to avoid any red flags.      See also: Hacker Exploits Flaw in Decentralized Bitcoin Exchange Bisq to Steal $250K      It's not clear what the hackers' motivation was for sending $27,000 worth of ether to Binance on Wednesday.

Further, the plaintiffs – led by the Mangrove Partners Master Fund, Ltd. – did not provide any ""facts"" that that the statements had been false at the time they were published, it argues.      ""In fact, the Complaint does not contain a single contemporaneous allegation – any person, meeting, or internal document – suggesting that any Defendant knew of, or had access to, information inconsistent with any challenged statement,"" the filing reads.      On the second point, while Patrick Byrne – Overstock's CEO at the time and a defendant in the suit – had long argued that naked short sellers were an evil to be abolished – Overstock claims that the lawsuit does not actually provide allegations of a ""deceptive act."" More specifically, it says that defendants made no claim that Overstock had deliberately placed ""inaccurate"" information into the market regarding its digital dividend.      That the dividend would be problematic for short sellers had been ""recognized and publicized"" by market observers on the day it was announced, says Overstock. And the fact that the defendants recognized this in their complaint ""is fatal to pleading an underlying manipulative act and reliance.""      As such Overstock calls upon the Utah court to dismiss the lawsuit with prejudice, as ""the broad media coverage belies Plaintiff’s contention that Defendants’ conduct or statements deceived anyone.""      See also: Byrne Sells Overstock Stake to Buy Crypto and Battle ‘Deep State’      The lawsuit was originally filed Sept. 27, 2019, with the lead plaintiff at the time being investor Benjamin Ha. It claimed Overstock had made false claims to artificially inflate the value of Overstock stock and allowed Byrne to sell all of his shares – worth over $100 million at the time – at unrealistic prices when he left the firm.      Byrne departed last August after disclosing he’d been in a three-year affair with a Russian agent and claiming that he'd acted as a confidential informant for law enforcement agencies.

The points can be spent on premium features and used as a measure of reputation in the community, the social media platform said.      Users are rewarded based on their contribution to their favorite channels, with the community ultimately deciding how many points each user receives. Users can hoard their points or spend them on unique features such as badges, custom emojis and GIFs in comments.      “We continuously run experiments to explore features that engage our users and communities. With Community Points, we’re working exclusively with two communities to test this feature and gather feedback from our users,” a spokesperson for Reddit told CoinDesk. The spokesperson did not name the two communities, but an image on the announcement suggests they are r/Cryptocurrency and r/FortNiteBR.      In addition, users will be able to leave a tip for comments they like or posts they see as valuable. Users will also be able to transfer community points directly to another Reddit member's Vault as well as any Ethereum wallet address.      In order to start contributing, users need to sign up to the ""Vault,"" Reddit's local blockchain wallet, accessed via scanning a QR code through the official Reddit app.      According to the post, community points are controlled by the user where users retain full control, meaning moderators nor Reddit itself can take points away or decide how they should be spent.      As it currently stands, it can be hard for other members to see how much one user has contributed to a community. Reddit's points hope to fix that by making the process more transparent with a total balance displayed next to their name.      There is a warning, however. A private key is provided once a user creates a Vault, which is stored locally on the user's smart device. That means if the user doesn't create a backup key and loses his phone, he will be unable to access the community points, with Reddit claiming even it will be unable to help.    How does it work?    According to Reddit, community points are run by ""a suite of smart contracts that manage balanaces, distribution/claiming and purchasing memberships."" They utilize and leverage existing parts of the Ethereum ecosystem, such as the ERC-20 token standards, which in turn have been reviewed by Trail of Bits, an independent blockchain security firm.      The transactions on Ethereum cost ""gas,"" which are tiny amounts of Ethereum's native crypto, ether (ETH). Reddit has stated that since most users don't own any ETH, the social platform is ready to cover the cost of gas ""for now"" for those using its in-built Vault, but those using other Ethereum wallets may be required to pay for the cost of gas themselves.      The platform said it plans to adopt a better scaling and gas solution in the future ""as they emerge"" while the rollout of community points remains in beta throughout the remainder of the summer.      Posts on both the r/Cryptocurrency and r/FortNiteBR subreddits by a Reddit administrator introduced the new tokens, called moons and bricks respectively.      It's unclear how far Reddit plans to take the tests or what its next steps might look like, but Wednesday's announcement is an expansion of an already-running trial. A user shared details about the potential Community Points last month, though at the time the spokesperson said the program was confined to a single subreddit.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MINING,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/14/reddit-rolls-out-community-points-on-ethereum-to-incentivize-positive-behavior,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f652b739818b0c7367aa8c4819b2801f3e8baa85-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
