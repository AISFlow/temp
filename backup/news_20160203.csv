42426626,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJuoFh,1454533520,Commonwealth Pushes Member Countries to Declare Bitcoin Legal,"The Commonwealth of Nations has released a new report that calls on its 53 member countries to speak out about the legality of bitcoin and other digital currencies.  Published on 3rd February, the report is the result of nearly a year of research conducted by the Commonwealth through its Working Group on Virtual Currencies. The group was commissioned following a roundtable event convened last February by the Commonwealth Secretariat, its main governmental body.  The report found that of the countries under its mandate, only Bangladesh had deemed that bitcoin and alternative digital currencies were unlawful, and that even after this declaration, such activity continues unabated.  With this in mind, it concluded that member countries make a ""positive determination on the legality of virtual currencies"" given its conclusion that the ""prohibition of virtual currencies is unlikely to be effective.""  The report reads:  ""Financial regulators and central banks should consider making public statements on the legality of virtual currencies and the applicability of any existing legislative frameworks. Education and funding should be provided for training for law enforcement.""  Overall, the report provides a comprehensive overview of developments in the bitcoin and blockchain ecosystem, with sections ranging in coverage from its more positive use cases in payments and remittances to the use of the technology in cybercrime.  Concurrent with member country concerns about crime, researchers even attempted to access a ""dark web crawler"" for purposes of the report. However, due to delays in the acquisition of this resource, any findings were too early to be included.  The Commonwealth of Nations includes 53 states in Africa, Asia the Caribbean, Europe and the Pacific, including such notable markets as Australia, Canada, India and South Africa.  Regulatory recommendations  On the subject of criminal offenses, the report recommended that member states move to ensure their laws apply to the technology while collaborating more broadly with other regulators around the globe.  The report advised that regulations be applied as necessary to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing, pointing out that, to date, this has meant overseeing ATM and exchange-related services.  However, the paper acknowledged lawmakers would need to take an ""innovative"" approach to any rulemaking, given that crimes can still be committed by digital currency users who are not converting funds into government-backed currencies.  The paper went on to encourage member states to make public statements on how the use of digital currencies falls under tax laws when they are used as a medium of exchange; update legislation related to the proceeds of crime; and extend consumer protection frameworks to cover the industry.  Regulation was notably not recommended for distributed ledger use cases of the technology, as the report read:  ""Any regulatory and legislative frameworks should focus on interactions with fiat currencies and avoid attempting to regulate the underlying decentralised ledger technology.""  Evidence of use  More unique to the report was its attempt to quantify how widely used the technology is in Commonwealth member countries.  Using public sources, researchers ultimately found evidence that the basic Bitcoin Core wallet had been downloaded in 46 member states, though use varied sharply.  While the report acknowledged it suffered from a lack of available data, it did suggest that bitcoin use is correlated with Internet access, with the ""countries with the highest levels of Internet penetration"" having the highest wallet downloads.

42426631,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJuoPh,1454527004,UNICEF Eyes Blockchain As Possible Solution to Child Poverty Issues,"Blockchain technology could provide a solution to issues facing the world’s impoverished children, according to Christopher Fabian, one of the co-founders of the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) innovation effort.  In a new interview with CoinDesk, Fabian said that UNICEF has spent months discussing blockchain tech internally and how it can be used to address payments and identity problems in conflict areas.  Potential applications aside, Fabian said that he does not believe the technology is mature enough today to address problems UNICEF aims to solve. Yet, that hasn’t stopped the organization, including its global network of field offices and laboratories, from weighing possible blockchain applications.  He explained:  ""I don’t think it's quite there yet, but when we're looking at problems like giving someone an identity when they don’t have a sovereign identity granted to them, or how you allow movement of money from one place to another quickly, those are things that blockchain starts to hint at.”  The organization, founded in 1946 and based in New York City, recently announced that it’s Innovation Fund is accepting applications from open-source projects that are focused on new technologies, including blockchain.  Those selected will receive as much as $50,000 in funding, as well as additional resources from the UNICEF community. UNICEF set a deadline of 26th February for applications, and intends to announce its initial investments sometime in April.  Quiet approach  According to Fabian, UNICEF has spent the past year observing developments in the bitcoin and blockchain ecosystem, but that to date it has not taken any steps to invest in startups or develop any in-house solutions.  ""We been kind of tracking blockchain for about a year, but we thought it would be a nice time as we launch this innovation venture fund to invest in it,"" he told CoinDesk.  ""So we haven't done an investment in it like other technologies, but we have a pretty good track record of testing out and prototyping stuff, and then getting solutions to market that benefit the world’s most vulnerable children.”  Fabian went on to cite conversations with groups like the MIT-based Digital Currency Initiative, as well as investors working in the space.  He said that beyond the Innovation Fund effort, UNICEF plans to make further investments in blockchain-focused projects.  Focus on identity, payments  For now, UNICEF is looking at two primary uses cases for blockchain technology: micropayments and identity.  ""We see huge potential [for blockchain technology] in the near future,"" he said. ""One is around internal cash transfers, small transfers of money that are happening with cash that could be made faster and be monitored to make sure people got that money.""  Perhaps more pressing, he suggested, is the use of the technology as a means to provide a form of identification.  According to a 2013 report from UNICEF, more than 200 million children under the age of five worldwide lack any kind of registration at birth, a situation that exposes them to economic hardship and possible exploitation.  ""We know that if you don’t have access to an identity and you're a child and you're in a war zone, you're most likely to be trafficked or hurt,"" said Fabian.  Ultimately, he indicated, the blockchain applications that grow out of the organization's efforts will likely result from work conducted at UNICEF program sites worldwide, saying:  ""Many of our teams in the field and our labs and country offices have expressed need for things that we think could be answered with an application of blockchain.""

42426627,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJuoLh,1454515310,Euroclear Sees Seven Steps to Bring Blockchain to Capital Markets,"Post-trade settlement specialist Euroclear has co-authored a new report on how blockchain and distributed ledger technology can be adapted for capital markets.  Written with management consulting firm Oliver Wyman, the report takes a positive stance on the technology, arguing it could eliminate delays and inefficiencies in capital markets. The publication follows news that Euroclear is working with its peers, including CME Group and the London Stock Exchange, on a consortium for post-trade settlement.  Overall, the report recommends the industry take seven steps to realize the technology, including working on proof-of-concepts, collaborating with industry peers and ""preparing a narrative"" for regulators and supervisory bodies that may interested in the implications of such investigations.  As with previous reports, Euroclear echoed the growing consensus that collaboration is needed to realize the full potential of the nascent technology.  In statements, Angus Scott, the firm’s head of product strategy and innovation, said:  ""In order to work together to shape a new future, the industry needs to take a collective view on the potential of the technology, which was the intention of this study. The market must embrace this potential, show patience with this development and invest in various innovative solutions to bring it to reality.""  The report also notably identified areas where blockchain technology would be able to cut costs for capital markets participants, such as through the decommissioning of redundant systems, increasing cost-sharing across institutions and by cutting counterparty credit risk.  The report further could that high-frequency trading could see a ""substantial slowdown"" should the technology validate ownership before an asset is sold.  However, the report continued to stress that market participants will need to work together to realize this future and overcome hurdles including scalability and a lack of regulatory clarity.

42426624,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJuoHh,1454508006,Blockstream Raises $55 Million to Build Out Bitcoin’s Blockchain,"Blockstream has raised $55m in Series A funding to continue its work expanding the bitcoin code base for commercial use.  With the news, Blockstream's total funding rises to $76m over two investment rounds. To date, the company's signature technology has been its sidechains offering, currently in testing, which enables the creation of blockchains that can validate data from, and transfer assets to, other blockchains.  Blockstream’s round was led by venture capital firms AXA Strategic Ventures, the venture capital arm of French multinational insurance firm AXA Group; Digital Garage, the Tokyo-based online payments firm co-founded by Joi Ito; and Hong Kong venture capital firm Horizons Ventures.  AME Cloud Ventures, Blockchain Capital and Future\Perfect Ventures were among other investment firms that participated in the deal.  Given the recent interest in private and permissioned blockchains, Blockstream sought to underscore the versatility of its technology as well as its early efforts to bring added functionality to the bitcoin network through interoperable blockchains.  Blockstream CEO Austin Hill told CoinDesk:  ""We were one of the first companies that painted a vision for interoperable blockchains, that there wasn’t going to be one blockchain, but many of them, all building off the bitcoin codebase to deliver the technology.""  Still, Hill said the company remains dedicated to developing technology for the open-source bitcoin blockchain, which it called the ""most mature, well-tested and secure"" infrastructure for blockchain services.  ""What we would hate to see happen is the most robust and secure blockchain protocol getting left by the wayside if people moved on to different protocols and tech stacks that bitcoin isn’t designed for,"" Hill continued, adding:  ""We believe there is a benefit to society to have all these blockchains be interoperable.""  Bitcoin and blockchain  In particular, Hill cited the recent decision by blockchain startup Digital Asset Holdings to use Blockstream’s tech as part of its Open Ledger Project, an open-source blockchain initiative being overseen by the Linux Foundation, as an example how the bitcoin codebase can become more relevant for commercial applications.  Notably, the fundraising follows the revelation that Digital Asset itself had raised more than $60m in a round from fourteen major banks. Following on the heels of this announcement, Hill acknowledged there may be an impulse on the part of the market to compare the rounds.  On one hand, Digital Asset was able to attract 14 major banks and IBM for its permissioned or private blockchain solutions, whereas Blockstream’s round includes mostly venture capital firms and its technology is targeted toward the bitcoin network.  However, Hill doesn’t see the companies as competitive or the rounds as illustrative of any gap in how global investors are reacting to the technology  ""There are times when we compete for opportunities, but we collaborate with the guys at Digital Asset. They give us feedback on our code, we have meetings with them to show common architecture,"" Hill continued.  He went on to emphasize that the groups remain focused on very different opportunities given the backgrounds and expertise of their respective team members.  ""There are some parts that they’re focusing on that are not our expertise or focus. We’re happy to see syndicated loans emerge on a blockchain, but we have a whole different background,"" he added.  Boost for bitcoin  Hill went on to position the round as a vote of confidence for the bitcoin ecosystem as a whole, arguing that he believes bitcoin’s code base will become widely used, even by private or permissioned blockchain solutions due to its proven functionality.  ""Bitcoin is the most mature blockchain protocol. It’s had a running $2bn-$7bn security bounty, the largest bounty ever placed on a protocol, for years, and that gives people confidence,"" Hill explained.  As such, Hill suggested Blockstream’s value proposition will be in its ability to adapt bitcoin’s codebase for other production use cases such as Liquid, its product aimed at improving transaction speeds for traders and exchanges.  In turn, Hill said he expects bitcoin's code to be used similarly by more firms, even as they adapt blockchain tech for enterprise use cases.  “There are some people who are taking the approach of starting to code something brand new, we haven’t seen any of those in production,” he said, adding:  ""We see this often when we talk to customers and investors, they see us as a great building block in developing the work in the open-source [bitcoin] community for other use cases.""
