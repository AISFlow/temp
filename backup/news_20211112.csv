42424284,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2mn9h,1636755687,"xDai Wants a Gnosis Merger to Stay Relevant, but Some Tokenholders Are Crying Foul","A historic, multimillion-dollar deal between a layer 1 base layer network with a devout following and a major Ethereum infrastructure builder may have hit a snag this week as some token speculators believe they may be getting shortchanged.  In a governance forum proposal this week, Gnosis founder Martin Köppelmann laid out a plan that would allow the Ethereum development heavyweight to merge with xDai, a popular Ethereum sidechain for developers and one of the oldest layer 1 alternatives.  The merger would combine technical savvy and major funding to create “Gnosis Chain,” a combined effort that could help the two projects stand out in a crowded market for layer 1s currently forcing chains to spend hundreds of millions on incentives for developers and users.  Not all parties support the merger, however. In governance forums, holders of xDai’s STAKE token are complaining that the terms of the deal amount to a “hostile takeover” by Gnosis.  Meanwhile, the xDai team says an injection of business development, marketing and funding from Gnosis might be what the chain needs to avoid becoming an “obsolete, old-school, boomer network,” as project manager Igor Barinov put it in an interview with CoinDesk.  “If we don’t do this, if we don’t bring in new capital, we’re going to remain a chain for hipsters.” he added.  Messy mergers  Despite widespread anticipation that decentralized mergers and acquisitions might become a popular phenomenon in 2021, the xDai community’s response to the proposed merger may be a case study for why few have come to fruition.  In late 2020, a host of bloated protocol treasuries across the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and a series of high-profile mergers and/or protocol collaborations from Yearn.Finance led to widespread speculation the market was entering an era of decentralized mergers and acquisition – that moving forward, protocols would be working to acquire other protocols via token purchases or governance action on a routine basis.  Mergers have largely failed to materialize aside from a handful of high-profile deals including ICO-era veterans Keep and NuCypher merging to form Keanu, and cross-blockchain bridge Ren “joining” Alameda Research, however.  Part of the problem is that, unlike with traditional M&A, combining organizations isn’t as easy as a rebrand and swapping some stock. Calibrating how to manage and merge multiple governance tokens and their potential exchange rates can lead to headaches. Achieving consensus on deal terms in a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) can be more difficult than with a board of directors.  In the case of Gnosis and xDai, the merger would be more of a process than an event. Per Gnosis Improvement Proposal 16 (GIP-16), in order to facilitate the merger Gnosis will build and fund a swap contract that will accept xDai’s STAKE staking rewards token in exchange for GNO, Gnosis’ native token. The current proposed parameters for the exchange are a 10% premium on top of STAKE’s 14-day, time-weighted average price.  STAKE’s current native rewards system will depreciate over time, further incentivizing holders to make the switch. GNO will then become the new staking token for the Gnosis Beacon Chain, and xDai will rebrand to Gnosis Chain as a shard of the Beacon Chain. Current xDai validators “will have a chance” to become Gnosis Chain node operators as well.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Köppelmann, the Gnosis CEO, said that for all the moving parts, determining the basis of the merger wasn’t as complicated as some might expect.  “At the end [it was] surprisingly simple. I think if teams respect each other’s work and share the same values you can come to a meaningful agreement pretty quickly,” he said.  Value proposition  Gnosis, as a spin-off from Ethereum development behemoth ConsenSys, is well connected, boasting relationships with multiple infrastructure and tooling organizations as well as a generous war chest of GNO tokens – both of which are key assets that the technically inclined xDai lacks.  xDai’s Barinov told CoinDesk that a dearth of insider connections and big-budget incentive programs has been a barrier for xDai’s adoption. xDai only counts four employees across the marketing, operations and business development departments.  “To bring blue-chips on a small chain, you need VC connections like Avalanche, Polygon and Fantom [have], or you need some reputation, which is also important, or you need users and incentives that bring business opportunities,” he said of the merger.  “All of the sources of potential communities will be easier for xDai” should the merger go through, he added.  As part of the proposal, Gnosis is also allocating 400,000 GNO tokens, currently worth $200 million, to various incentive programs for the new chain. Incentivized bridges and incentivized ecosystems are increasingly becoming the norm, and various layer 1s have been jockeying to attract users with ever-larger liquidity mining programs.  Read more: Harmony Has $300M for Projects Looking to Expand Beyond Ethereum  xDai, meanwhile, has long been a favorite for in-the-know developers. The chain is home to Dark Forest, a cult on-chain gaming hit, data-sharing protocol Swarm and NFT badge maker Proof of Attendance Protocol (POAP).  Barinov said the merger between the two projects – combining an incentive program, business development chops and a pre-existing community of developers – is key to stand out in an increasingly crowded market for layer 1s.  “I don’t know any other industry where you have this kind of competitive space between leaders. Other industries you have three, four, five leaders – here there’s so, so many,” he said.  ‘Betrayal’  A vocal portion of the xDai community rejects the view of the merger as a mutually beneficial arrangement, however.  “Gno merger is a hostile takeover and the faithful hodlers of Stake is being slapped in the face,” wrote one user in xDai’s governance forums.  “xdai is being bought up for few pennies while its a damn gem. Long term holders are getting robbed,” wrote another.  So far, 59% of respondents to an informal poll have said they don’t support the merger. At the core of many of the complaints is the exchange rate for STAKE. xDai speculators have long held that STAKE is overdue for a price run, similar to the astounding gains layer 1 tokens like SOL, AVAX, MATIC, FTM and others enjoyed over the last year.  However, the exchange rate is unlikely to change due to possible legal complications. After the announcement of GIP-16, GNO rallied to a high of $625, up from $580 earlier in the day. Likewise, STAKE jumped from $16 to nearly $21. Changing the terms of the exchange could now constitute market manipulation, Barinov warned, but he did leave open the door to additional compensation for the STAKE community.  “We think the Gnosis team can somehow react to the community, and propose additional ways to compensate the STAKE holders. Gnosis plans to spin off Gnosis Safe and Cowswap, and they will airdrop [those tokens] to current Gnosis holders,” he said, adding wallets that make the STAKE-GNO exchange could be included in a possible airdrop as well.  Additionally, the xDai team is planning an AMA to address concerns, and will be holding a snapshot vote in the coming weeks to gauge the depth of the problem among proven STAKE holders.  Barinov also pointed out that disgruntled STAKE holders might have few options for recourse, short of forking the chain.  “Technically they have no way to stop the swap from happening if Gnosis decides to make the swap contract,” he said.  Builders and speculators  In contrast to the response on the governance forums, developers for many of the projects built on xDai have expressed public support for the merger.  Members of xDai projects like POAP, DAOSquare and Colony have all chimed in positively, while xDai team members have framed the debate in terms of builders and speculators.  “There’s two competing interests here. There’s STAKE-ers, who are mostly involved in trading STAKE, and then there’s the people using the chain and the builders and developers, who have not yet come out in support in public forums,” said xDai technical writer Andrew Gross.  The xDai team admitted it was “difficult” to see the vitriol, and expressed frustration that many were overlooking the meat of the proposal by solely homing in on the exchange rate.  “The main part is not about forking tokens or rebranding. The focus is how to widen the ecosystem, work on narratives like universal basic income and making existing partnerships broader,” said Barinov.  “There’s a lot of positive here. There’s a lot of upside for the future,” he added.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/11/12/xdai-wants-a-gnosis-merger-to-stay-relevant-but-some-tokenholders-are-crying-foul,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/27383f65590f6ae01c8f84ce554f1d7b21ce6407-4000x3000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42424294,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2mnRh,1636753425,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Expected to Rise on Taproot Upgrade,"Cryptocurrencies were mostly lower on Friday after buyers failed to sustain the all-time price highs reached in bitcoin and ether earlier this week. Analysts expect trading activity to advance next week following the Bitcoin Taproot upgrade, which aims to improve privacy and efficiency on the blockchain network.  “Bulls may have some power left to push the market higher as a result of the [Taproot] upgrade,” Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad, chief product officer at Bitpanda, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  The upgrade is expected to be implemented in the next few days, although other analysts expect minimal impact on bitcoin’s price. It’s possible some investors have entered long positions ahead of the Taproot upgrade given BTC’s near 30% gain over the past few months.  In the meantime, traders are looking beyond bitcoin for additional profit opportunities, albeit after a possible price correction.  “Bitcoin’s chart has likely become too noisy to remain a reliable indicator of the crypto market, conceding that role to ether,” Alex Kuptsikevich, an analyst at FxPro, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. “If so, a break of this strong uptrend could prove to be the first signal of a correction,” which could encourage buying on dips, Kuptsikevich wrote.  Read more: An Investor’s Perspective on the Bitcoin Taproot Upgrade  Latest prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $64,192, -0.97%  Ether (ETH): $4,673, -1.31%  S&P 500: $4,682, +0.72%  Gold: $1,865, +0.18%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.57%  Bitcoin volatility declines  Bitcoin’s realized volatility is slowly drifting back toward a one-year low, according to options data provider Skew. The chart below shows a persistent decline in volatility since May, which was when BTC entered a bear market.  For now, some analysts expect volatility to remain low despite recent all-time price highs. QCP Capital, a crypto trading firm based in Singapore, stated in a Telegram chat that it holds a neutral position in BTC and a short-vega options position in ETH. Short-vega means the trader benefits if implied volatility falls.  Ether pullback expected  Ether, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, could face a pullback toward the $4,000-$4,2000 support zone. Technical indicators show initial signs of upside exhaustion after ether reached an all-time price high around $4,800 earlier this week.  ETH is up about 3% over the past week, compared with a 4% rise in BTC over the same period. The chart below shows a slight drop in the ETH/BTC price ratio this month, although the downside appears to be limited toward the 0.067 support level.  Click here for technical analysis on BTC.  Additionally, blockchain data shows ether’s active addresses and trading volumes have decoupled from rising prices, which could indicate scope for a pullback in ETH, CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reported.  Altcoin roundup  OMG tanks over 25% as exchanges see record inflows: OMG, the native token of the OMG Network layer 2 scaling protocol for Ethereum, crashed on Friday, CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reported. The cryptocurrency, which promises faster and cheaper transactions, fell 27% to $12.70 in what appeared to be a classic “sell the fact” reaction to Boba Network’s completion of a snapshot for an airdrop to OMG holders. OMG hit its lowest price since Oct. 28, falling below the 50-day moving average support after 3 ½ months, CoinDesk 20 data shows.  Binance freezes DOGE withdrawals: The largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, temporarily suspended withdrawals of DOGE due to minor issues that occurred following an upgrade, CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen and Anna Baydakova reported. Some users experienced significant problems after the update, claiming the exchange first initiated the withdrawal of dogecoin without their consent and now is asking them to return the DOGE they don’t have in their accounts.  Sam Bankman-Fried says Solana is better than Ethereum: FTX founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried believes Solana is a better blockchain than Ethereum, Markets Insider reported. During a conference held by Yahoo Finance and Decrypt, the 29-year old crypto billionaire argued that Solana is one of the few blockchains that can handle mass adoption by accommodating a large number of users and transactions. “Solana is one of the few currently existing public blockchains that has a really plausible roadmap to scale millions of transactions per second at, you know, fractions of a penny per transaction,” Bankman-Fried said.

Funding will be used to expand Forte’s products and services, as well as speed up the onboarding of emerging game and content publishers.  Forte’s platform is used by gaming publishers to incorporate blockchain technology into their games. The platform also allows non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to be minted and sold.

42424287,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2mnDh,1636752274,"For Universal’s NFT Band, Music Is Second to Brand Identity","On Thursday, Universal Music Group (UMG) announced it had signed Kingship – not a musician, but a collection of four anthropomorphic non-fungible tokens (NFT).  Billed as a “metaverse group,” Kingship is a partnership between UMG and the NFT investor Jimmy McNelis, who owns the four tokens in question. Conceptually, it’s a little like Gorillaz, the “virtual band” created by rock musician Damon Albarn in the late 1990s. Each image comes along with its own fabricated backstory.  The difference is that where Gorillaz was the brainchild of a musician, Kingship is mostly just a brand partnership. Even if you didn’t care about the schtick (the detailed lore, the Gorillaz-branded online games), you could at least assess the music on its own terms. So far, Kingship appears to be all schtick.  Read more: The Social (Token) Network: Rally, Friends With Benefits and the Future of Branding  Three of Kingship’s tokens (members?) come from Bored Ape Yacht Club, one of today’s priciest NFT collections. The tokens start at around $150,000, but some have sold for figures in the millions. The fourth – a grotesque, zombified take on a cartoon ape – comes from a spin-off collection called Mutant Ape Yacht Club. All four are still banked in one of McNelis’ personal Ethereum wallets, as opposed to with UMG.  The UMG subdivision behind this endeavor is 10:22 PM, which characterizes itself as a “next-gen Web 3 label.” Founded in 2018, the label was initially meant as a home for influencers (other signees include Chantal Jeffries and former Vine star Lele Pons). Kingship marks its first foray into crypto.  “There’s a reason why the individual apes and mutants were picked,” said 10:22 PM founder Celine Joshua. “You’re going to see the personalities, the characters, they’re going to come to life as 3D. It’ll be almost like the way Marvel looks at [its] vault and IP [intellectual property] and starts to storytell.”  That storytelling process doesn’t actually involve music, for now. Joshua explained that while Kingship is, in fact, an official UMG signee, the plan is to give audiences a taste of the IP first – the stories and world-building behind the four characters – before any music comes into play.  Read more: The Bored Ape Founders Haven’t Yet Joined the Yacht Club  “Before you even hear a single note, you’re gonna know what they eat for breakfast,” she said.  And if you’re among the lucky few who actually own a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT, you’ll get “early access to everything [Kingship does].” That could include the music itself, but also potential NFT drops and metaverse concert experiences.  A common critique of crypto is that it exacerbates wealth inequality – holders of specific tokens might be granted early or exclusive access to derivative NFT projects. In this context, a valuable NFT can essentially be a license to print more money. Mutant Apes, the cheapest of which now goes for about $20,000, were a free gift to Bored Ape owners.  Still, Joshua insists Kingship isn’t about promoting exclusivity: “When Bored Ape Yacht Club started, they just minted it. The community and the value of it of course increased the floor price. This is the same thing here, we’re not going to do anything different. It’s going to be about the masses, and making sure that anyone who is a fan could have one.”  But speculating on NFTs isn’t about the masses, really – at least not yet. Fees (especially on the Ethereum blockchain) can be prohibitively expensive, and the bro culture around NFTs can be alienating for newcomers.  In an inversion of the traditional major label A&R model, Joshua and McNelis are betting on reaching a wider audience through world-building alone. The closest analog is probably “Jenkins the Valet” – a brand built around an invented persona for one of the Bored Apes – which proved there’s a market for this sort of thing. “Jenkins” has released its own spin-off NFT collection, and recently signed with Creative Artists Agency.  Kingship could represent another role in the expanded universe of Bored Ape content. Why shouldn’t a world with an ape valet also accommodate an ape band?  Joshua added: “We’re going to be speaking to audiences where this will be their first entry into NFTs, because we know that music bridges the learning curve involved with tech and format changes in our business.”  Maybe. Whether Kingship’s niche attempt at world-building can accomplish that is another question.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING | AR,Will Gottsegen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/11/11/for-universals-nft-band-music-is-second-to-brand-identity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1180c470cec4a7f1363543e259d983806237d0a8-2828x1682.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to the parameters set forward by ""Speedy Trial,"" if at least 90% of the blocks mined in any of the designated two-week difficulty periods ""signal"" their support for the upgrade, then the activation process can begin. To be more precise: 1,815 out of 2,016 blocks mined within a period have to include a little piece of encoded information that indicates that the miners who mined those blocks are in favor of the upgrade.  Read more: Why Bitcoin’s Taproot Upgrade Matters  During this second difficulty period, at block 687284, that benchmark was met. By the time the difficulty period ends on Sunday, it is likely Taproot will have locked in with over 99% of blocks signaling decisively in its favor.  Speedy Trial and the long road to consensus  Taproot is Bitcoin’s most anticipated upgrade since Segregated Witness (SegWit) in 2017. Whereas the main focus of SegWit was scaling the Bitcoin protocol, Taproot will outfit Bitcoin with a new signature scheme known as Schnorr signatures. This small adjustment to the Bitcoin code opens up new possibilities for privacy, multisignature wallets and security, as well as scaling.  Read more: How Bitcoin’s Taproot Upgrade Will Improve Technology Across Bitcoin’s Software Stack  Now that the threshold has been met, the end of this difficulty period on Sunday will mark the completion of the first phase of Speedy Trial.  Speedy Trial is the process the Bitcoin community of developers and stakeholders agreed to use to determine if there was enough support from the miners to go ahead with the Taproot soft fork. For months, even once it was clear that there was widespread support for the upgrade, there was still debate as to how it would be implemented.  Any alteration to Bitcoin's code require consensus; there is no one person or entity ""in charge"" that can unilaterally make those changes. Arriving at that consensus can sometimes be even more complicated than writing the code itself. In the case of Taproot, Speedy Trial, devised by David Harding and Russell O’Connor, was the solution that got the most community support.  The next step toward Taproot activation  Now that the Taproot soft fork upgrades are locked in, the next phase of activation is basically a five-month waiting period. During this time, miners and nodes will have ample opportunity to update their software to Bitcoin Core 0.21.1, the newest version of Bitcoin Core that contains activation logic for the Taproot soft fork (and some other improvements).  Finally, in November, when Bitcoin reaches a specified ""block height"" (Bitcoin block 709,632), Taproot will activate; that is, the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) relevant to Taproot and contained in Bitcoin Core 0.21.1 will automatically kick in. At that point, all upgraded nodes and devices will be able to recognize and accept transactions made using that upgraded protocol.  After activation, what happens next?  From there, it will be up to developers in the Bitcoin ecosystem to make use of the tools that Taproot brings to the table, specifically Schnorr signatures, which will replace Bitcoin’s current elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA).  Read more: Bitcoin’s Future: Exactly How a Coming Upgrade Could Improve Privacy and Scaling  These smaller and faster Schnorr signatures also have the added benefit of being “linear,” a combination that will boost Bitcoin's transaction privacy and allow for more lightweight and complex “smart contracts” (an encoded contract with self-executing rules).  In the long run, Taproot’s tooling and coding improvements will translate to a better user experience for bitcoiners in terms of overall performance, as well as privacy improvements to multisignature (multisig) technology, privacy software and even scaling tech like the Lightning Network.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | FORKS,Christie Harkin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/06/12/locked-in-bitcoins-taproot-upgrade-gets-its-90-mandate,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bd0aaba8eac194dd872d21fb1bf6e0a4c0111bf9-1210x565.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

What’s causing that inflation? Well, Bitcoin advocates and gold bugs argue that it’s all about the debasement of fiat currencies through massive printing. That perspective sees it as a self-perpetuating monetary phenomenon that will be very difficult for central banks to stop.

They say inflation is transitory, a temporary problem that will be resolved once shipping networks return to normal.  The following chart doesn’t answer who is correct. But it does put some illustration onto the supply chain problem. This is the deep sea freight cost component within the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ producer price index for the past two years, drawn from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis’s FRED database.  The freight price index is up 20% from a year ago. Those rising prices will themselves feed into U.S. consumer prices downstream.

Crypto markets took a dip Thursday just around the time it was reported that China’s Evergrande Group was on the verge of defaulting on a bond payment. While the embattled housing giant ultimately made its scheduled payment of $148 million, questions persist about the long-term prospects for it and other real estate developers in China. Bitcoin, meanwhile, remained above all-time highs by about 5.5%.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  What does one have to do with the other? Well, think of a detective in a movie who takes a corkboard, some photos and a lot of white strings to put all the parts of a story together.  It goes something like this: About half of all bitcoin trades against stablecoin tether (USDT), according to data from CryptoCompare. About half of Tether’s roughly $75 billion in assets, which back USDT, is in commercial paper. While Tether (the company) said back in September it doesn’t hold Evergrande commercial paper, about a month ago Bloomberg BusinessWeek reported Tether’s holdings included “billions of dollars of short-term loans to large Chinese companies – something money-market funds avoid.”  So while Evergrande may not be on the books, the concern is that the commercial paper may be from other real estate firms.  Scaled to size  Understanding the magnitude of size and growth of USDT, bitcoin and Chinese commercial paper may help give some perspective to the latest headlines.  Just two years ago, USDT’s market cap was a mere $4 billion. Thus, it has grown 19-fold in a matter of two dozen months.  In those two years, bitcoin’s market cap has gone up eight times, from $159 billion to $1.3 trillion.  Meanwhile, based on data from the People’s Bank of China, Chinese commercial paper ended Q2 in 2021 at around $900 billion, up from just shy of $700 billion that same quarter in 2019, a gain of less than a third.  In absolute terms, the sizes look something like this:  A chart like the one above doesn’t give a sense of the rate of growth for each, but this does:  Bitcoin and USDT look somewhat related, but does one move as a function of the other? Perhaps, if one were to scale tether on a different Y-axis like so:  Perhaps the tail wags the dog. Or perhaps there are other ways to explain things.  Read more: A Bridge Called Tether  Tether’s defenders can say that even if one were to assume Tether spent half of every dollar it is said to have taken in over the past two years on commercial paper in China, that would be under one-fifth of new issuances and 4% of the market.  That should refute anyone who could try to argue USDT may have fueled China’s boom in commercial paper. Yet, does Tether truly own a lot of Chinese commercial paper? Can it be liquidated to meet redemptions? Those questions can only be answered with a little more transparency from the stablecoin’s issuer.

42421687,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXp9Pp,1636747049,How Crypto Becomes Money,"By soaring 4.4% to new record highs Wednesday after the release of a report that showed U.S. inflation hit its highest level in 31 years and then losing all of that in the day, bitcoin played straight into the hands of mainstream economists who pooh-pooh its potential as a currency.  Such volatile moves, they will argue, make it impossible for cryptocurrencies to serve what traditional economics describes as the three functions of money: i) a medium of exchange, ii) a store of value, and iii) a unit of account. A currency cannot play those roles, the argument goes, if its value is moving around so much without any predictability.  That sounds almost irrefutable, right? But what if the three functions framework is based on a flawed, or overly narrow, definition of money?  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  In “Money: The Unauthorized Biography,” Felix Martin argues that through history people have tended to wrongly think about money as a “thing” (such as a banknote or a chunk of a precious metal such as gold) and not for it what it is: a socially invented governance system for tracking transfers of property and clearing debt in a commonly trusted manner. By viewing money as something to be owned and accumulated, we’ve fetishized currencies rather than treating them as a means to an end.  In Martin’s construction, a country’s or an economy’s universally accepted currency is the thing. It is not the money. The currency is merely a tool that makes it easier to carry out the extremely difficult task of recording, counting and valuing transactions across a community of otherwise untrusting strangers.  In this way, cash can be viewed as a decentralized, peer-to-peer record-keeping device – as if by me giving you $10, my anonymous account in the dollar economy is debited by that amount and yours is credited. If you deposit those funds into a bank, you move the account into a different accounting system, but it’s ultimately serving the same function.  Over the centuries, this national currency-based money model became dominant, as sovereign states shaped it into a system of social organization and control. Whether it was fiat currency or gold-backed currency, the state set the rules and provided the foundation of trust – with varying degrees of success – by which people would use these record-keeping devices. But that is not the only way to think of how money could be organized.  Now, a new breed of open, censorship-resistant, geography-agnostic value transfer systems has emerged. Cryptocurrencies and their underlying blockchain protocols can provide rules and a framework of trust for users without needing to draw their authority from governments, even if their users remain bound by the laws of their home countries.  Many cryptocurrency proponents, filled with the same “focus-on-the-thing” instinct, tend to think of bitcoin replacing the dollar or at least providing a parallel alternative. But it’s possible to see a pathway where blockchains and digital assets (a much better descriptor of the tokens for these purposes than “cryptocurrencies”) do away with the need for universal common currencies altogether.  We have a long way to go, but if interoperability protocols and transaction processing can be scaled in a properly decentralized manner, such that buyers and sellers of digital assets can conduct cross-chain atomic swaps en masse without having to trust intermediaries, something akin to a global system of fractionalized digital value exchange is conceivable.  Need a car? You can buy it, not with dollars, but with a portion of another piece of property such as your small stake in that Beeple non-fungible token. Ironically, this vision seems like a new, digital version of an otherwise archaic value exchange system: barter. In this way, using the power to fractionalize digital ownership to any size imaginable addresses at least part of the “coincidence of wants” problem that made that system inefficient for civilizations.  Now, I can already hear traditional economists scoffing. What are you going to denominate those exchanges in? We need a common currency to overcome the impossible task of finding a real-time, fair price value for each asset across a gargantuan number of categories.  And, sure, to avoid using, say, a single currency as the reference price, we would need to build something unfathomably complex. We would need a universally accessible, open pricing platform that takes in data from a global network of price oracles tied to quadrillions of verifiably trusted devices deployed in every corner of the world. Based on a classification system for a massive variety of assets, it would constantly make available an almost infinite number of ever-changing cross-reference values in each asset relative to any of all the other assets. It’s kind of impossible, or at least it is until we get we’re on the verge of the singularity.  But we don’t need to achieve such an all encompassing state to start to break down the dominance of national currencies. The dollar could remain as the world’s reference price, for example, but there would be no need for people to obtain it in a transaction. In effect, we could strip dominant currencies of their medium of exchange and store-of-value functions while maintaining their unit of account role.  Already, central banks in Singapore and the United Arab Emirates are exploring interoperability solutions for their central bank digital currency that would do just that. The implications for the dollar’s investable status as the world’s reserve currency are profound.  And if we reduce our imagination to a scenario many sizes smaller than the universal digital barter system discussed above, the prospects for fragmented areas of in-kind exchange that either bypass existing currencies or use them as reference prices are much greater.  Think of how ether, viewed by many not as currency but as a crypto commodity that powers the Ethereum network, is already widely used as the medium of exchange for buying and selling NFTs. And, of course, for all the “bitcoin cannot be a currency” dismissiveness, it has long functioned, along with ether, as a fundraising vehicle for token sales.  In those situations, the dollar is still lurking in the background as either the explicit or implicit reference price.  Also, the more this goes on, the more people start to “think” in bitcoin, ether or some other digital asset. There are plenty of bitcoiners who like to remind everyone that, whatever its price versus the dollar, one bitcoin continues to be worth one bitcoin. Many believe bitcoin, with its censorship-resistant, persistent supply mechanism, could evolve to become the base layer collateral for the global financial system, taking on a role akin to Treasury bonds.  Whether, in this coming world, the dollar fully disappears from the picture or remains a reference price, the expansion of a crypto system implies it could eventually be a universal unit of account. With a claim to the other two supposed functions of money – a medium of exchange and a store of value – will the dollar cease to be money?  The answer is that the dollar – the “thing” – never was money. It was an element of money, one piece – albeit a dominant piece – of society’s system for tracking property transfers and clearing debts. In the future, the dollar’s role in that system could be diminished, while the role of bitcoin, ether, NFTs and other digital assets could increase. None of them will be money as we used to think about it.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Michael J.

The platform, which will be shared free of charge with other countries, will also operate national registries “to manage carbon inventory, climate registry and record bilateral corresponding adjustments with trades to shift credits among countries,” Chia announced.  Created in 2018, SINAMECC is Costa Rica’s official platform for coordinating climate information and tracking the country’s national climate change policy.  Andrea Meza Murillo, Minister of Environment and Energy of Costa Rica, said that the announcement “is a critical step toward robust, transparent cooperation on climate action focused on environmental integrity.”  “Teaming Costa Rica’s leadership in this initiative with the Chia blockchain will create real momentum to enable markets to help solve global, real world problems,” Chia Network President and Chief Operating Officer Gene Hoffman said in an email to CoinDesk.  Last week, Chia announced it was developing a data-sharing prototype for the World Bank’s Climate Warehouse, which will facilitate “the transparent sharing and reporting of climate project information and its issuances,” it said in a fact sheet.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Andrés Engler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/11/12/chia-network-to-help-costa-rican-government-track-climate-change,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e1196b6418c259e7f1e685275d93255b56edde79-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This means ETH is becoming a scarce asset now. Following London Fork, Ethereum Supply Rate Of Change Drops To Nearly Zero As pointed out by a CryptoQuant post, ETH&apos;s supply curve has nearly flattened now as rate of change drops to almost zero. This has made the asset scarce. The Ethereum supply indicator tells us about the total amount of ETH that&apos;s currently in circulation. As miners receive a block reward (in ETH) for mining blocks, this total supply increases with time. A related metric, the Ethereum supply rate of change shows how fast or slow the total circulating supply is going up. How ETH&apos;s supply works is different from Bitcoin; the latter has its total potential supply locked from the beginning. This means that there can come a point when miners will run out of BTC to mine. Ethereum has no such limit so miners can indefinitely keep it up and the supply will keep on increasing. This would be problematic for the crypto as it will result in higher volatility. The London hard fork exists to tackle this issue. As you know, to complete a transaction on the ETH network, you need to pay gas fees. This fees was originally given to miners. who put these coins back into circulation. But since the London fork, the fees is &apos;burned,&apos; and miners no longer receive it.

42396541,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT491l,1636741576,Kazakhstan’s Crypto Miners Face New Regulations After Contributing to Power Shortages,"Kazakhstan’s energy grid is coming apart at the seams because of the massive influx of bitcoin miners. But that might turn out to be a blessing in disguise as the government and industry look for a response that won’t decimate the industry.  The Central Asian country’s share of the global hashrate – the amount of computer processing power spent mining bitcoin – roughly doubled since May, when Chinese miners, banished from their own country, started moving operations overseas.  Kazakhstan is now dealing with electricity shortages, a problem that was hard to anticipate in an energy-rich country that normally has excess electricity. Government officials have blamed the issues on the influx of miners.  In response, the national grid operator KEGOC is rationing electricity provided to mines, and the Ministry of Energy has proposed a law that would introduce limits for any newly licensed cryptocurrency mines to 1 megawatt (MW) per mine and 100MW for the entire country.  Despite these regulatory moves, five crypto miners with operations in Kazakhstan told CoinDesk that they remain hopeful: In their view, the government is just trying to deal with the pressing electricity shortages, but remains friendly towards mining.  More than that, some of them think that the influx of Chinese miners will empower Kazakhstan to deal with age-old problems in its electricity sector, including outdated infrastructure and a reliance on coal.  On Nov. 10, the energy minister called on them to look for green energy solutions to the electricity conundrum.  Read more:Kazakhstan Won’t Restrict Electricity to Lawful Crypto Miners, Minister Says  Despite the energy crisis it has caused, crypto mining “has a good future in Kazakhstan,” in part “because the government wants to support renewable energy power production,” said Denis Rusinovich, co-founder of CMG Cryptocurrency Mining Group and Maverick Group.  The shortages  Kazakhstan, the largest country in Central Asia, sits on some of the world’s largest deposits of oil, natural gas, coal and uranium. It is a net energy exporter because it produces more than it can absorb.  But when Chinese miners set up shop in Kazakhstan, they took up any excess capacity and the surplus disappeared, said two crypto miners with operations in Kazakhstan, a representative for Kazakhstan’s largest mine hosting firm Enegix, Rusinovich and Didar Bekbau, co-founder of Kazakh mining firm Xive.io.  Read more: Banished Chinese Bitcoin Miners Look to the West, and Far Beyond  In a Nov. 4 interview with local news outlet Tengrin News, Minister of Energy Magzum Myrzagaliev said that Kazakhstan’s electricity demand had been steadily growing by 1%-2% annually until about 10 months ago. Starting 2021, demand has grown 8%, or about 1,000MW-1,200MW, which Myrzagaliev said was due to crypto mining.  This lack of electricity quickly became a problem for the national grid, with Almaty, the former capital and largest city in Kazakhstan, suffering a total blackout in mid-July.  The shortages are expected to worsen as winter approaches, when demand usually rises for heat. Kazakhstan’s winter temperature averages between -9°C and -12°C, according to the World Bank’s Climate Knowledge Portal.  To deal with the shortage, KEGOC started cutting off electricity to some miners in September, particularly in the southern part of the country.  Bekbau said one of their mines in the south has been shut down whilst others are facing electricity rationing. Rusinovich said the longest shutdown he is aware of lasted two days and occurred around mid-October. The Enegix representative said their mines are facing electricity restrictions during peak hours for about four to six hours per day.  The rationing not only applies to crypto mines. KEGOC announced planned outages for various consumers in October. But miners are a low priority to the government, so when there is a shortage, they are the first ones in the line of fire, Bekbau said.  The south is particularly vulnerable because it isn’t home to power plants. Electricity is mainly generated in the north part of the country, close to Kazakhstan’s rich coal deposits. Out of Kazakhstan’s 21,000MW of installed electricity capacity in 2017, more than half came from coal, the overwhelming majority of which was produced in the north, the World Bank said in a 2017 report.  But the Soviet-era national grid is not able to carry the electricity to the south, where installed capacity is scarce, Rusinovich and Bekbau said.  However, two other miners who wished not to be identified for this article because they weren’t authorized to speak on the matter, denied facing any forced electricity shutdowns.  Cleanup  The power restrictions come with a cleanup operation, whereby the government is trying to crack down on unauthorized mines that tap into the national grid without the right approval from authorities, including KEGOC.  Increasing numbers of illegal miners have contributed to the electricity deficit, Enegix CEO Yerbolsyn Sarsenov told CoinDesk in a statement.  KEGOC did not respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment on this article.  Energy minister Myrzagaliev blamed the electricity shortages on the influx of miners. According to the minister, gray miners in Kazakhstan consume 340MW of electricity, vis-a-vis 600MW consumed by lawful mining operations, he said in an interview with Tengrin News.  But the capacity going to gray mines is hard to estimate and might be as high as 1,000MW-1,200MW, Vice Minister Zhurebekov told Tengrin News.  President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev instructed the energy minister to quickly set up a regulatory framework which would allow existing “white” miners to continue their work without additional restrictions, according to an Oct. 29 meeting readout.  The bill  On Oct. 1, the Ministry of Energy issued a draft law that called on limiting the total electricity capacity going towards new mines to 100MW for the whole country, and 1MW per mine, for a period of two years.  The bill is set to take effect 60 days after it is published, but in the meantime it is open for public comments and could be altered.  All miners that CoinDesk spoke to agreed that the restrictions wouldn’t apply to existing mines. “The bill proposes to limit the permits given to new miners,” so it will not affect existing mines, said Enegix’s Sarsenov.  On Nov. 10, at a meeting with crypto industry representatives, Myrzagaliev confirmed that lawful mines that have been properly registered with authorities won’t be subject to restrictions.  When setting up crypto mines, companies usually sign long-term contracts with energy providers, in this case mostly KEGOC, locking up electricity prices for months or years. They have to follow a cumbersome process to get approval for their industrial energy use. It would be extremely difficult for the law to reverse existing contracts that have been signed following the correct procedures, people familiar with the process agreed.  But those that were working on new projects or had projects under construction are “waiting with crossed fingers” Bekbau said.  “I am open to dialogue,” Myrzagaliev said after a meeting with the crypto mining industry representatives.  After the consultation process, the final bill might include some exemptions to the 100MW limit that could create more leeway to build new mines. Some of these exemptions would push the country’s transition into renewable energy by encouraging miners to build their own green energy production capacity.  The law could require that miners have to build out their own renewable energy production capacity to match what they consume from the national grid, Bekbau said, or could exempt miners that use green or imported energy from the hard cap, Rusinovich said.  During the Nov. 10 meeting with the Ministry of Energy, miners noted that they are “ready to” import power from overseas and invest in renewable energy.  Enegix announced it plans to achieve energy autonomy using hydropower plants on Nov. 9. The company will start building plants to harvest energy from rivers in the first quarter of 2022.  Read more:Kazakh Mining Hosting Firm Enegix Looks for Energy Autonomy Through Hydropower  The future  Despite the power rationing and the bill, miners CoinDesk spoke to are hopeful about Kazakhstan’s future in the industry.  In June, Kazakhstan’s president also signed into law a bill under which crypto miners will be taxed 1 Kazakhstani tenge ($0.0023) per kilowatt hour consumed, starting in 2022. Miners see this as a positive development. Taxation means the government is welcoming the industry instead of banning it.  “It looks like the government wants to benefit from the ban in China” to increase its revenue, one source in Kazakhstan said.  The miners CoinDesk spoke to said the shortages reveal existing problems in Kazakhstan’s electricity infrastructure: Back in 2017, when mining saw its first boom in the country, the World Bank was already warning of an impending energy deficit.  The deficit is related to failures of major power plants in northern Kazakhstan, said the CEO of Enegix. When KEGOC announced power rationing across south Kazakhstan, it was responding to the failure of three major coal plants that caused a loss of 1,000MW of capacity.  These failures can be in part attributed to antiquated facilities. Kazakhstan’s energy infrastructure dates back to the Soviet Union. The government has been talking about updating it for a decade, Bekbau said.  With new taxes from miners, and a large new client for KEGOC that consumes a steady amount of electricity, Kazakhstan might update its infrastructure and pivot towards renewables after all.  In the meantime, however, some miners have already left the country, like Russia, Bekbau said. But this only represents a small minority as the rest are waiting for the final version of the bill, he said. Moving out of Kazakhstan is expensive because it is a landlocked country.  Miners who have done their due diligence and followed cumbersome legal procedures to lock up electricity prices and set up legit facilities in the country are unlikely to just pick up and leave, one miner told CoinDesk.  But he said the company is monitoring the regulatory situation and could change future plans for more investment in Kazakhstan.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MINING | REGULATION,Eliza Gkritsi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/11/12/kazakhstans-crypto-miners-face-new-regulations-after-contributing-to-power-shortages,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/50596a1037b312a21d0c23732714a45b6bc27dab-4608x3072.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396542,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT492k,1636738461,"Loopring Price Up 7-Fold This Month on GameStop Speculation, Metaverse Bets","Loopring (LRC), an Ethereum-based project that allows developers to build their own decentralized exchanges, has jumped a stunning sevenfold in price just this month, nearing a market valuation of $4 billion.  Analysts attributed the price jump to speculation ranging from GameStop-related rumors to the project’s potential usefulness in metaverse development.  “The sizable and consistent leaps over the last two weeks have brought LRC onto the radar of traders looking for the next scalp,” said Dragos Dunica, co-founder of DappRadar, a data and analysis website specializing in decentralized applications.  Loopring says it aims to create an interconnected system of trading platforms where buyers and sellers can access multiple platforms from a single dashboard and be matched together to trade crypto assets.  Loopring price  Some analysts point to speculation and rumors to explain the LRC price rally to around $3. The price has more than doubled just in the past week, making the Loopring token one of the top-performing assets in notoriously volatile cryptocurrency markets.  At the end of October, rumors circulated on Twitter that the videogame retailer GameStop – whose meme-y stock has become a favorite this year among individual traders – may be using Loopring’s technology to create a so-called NFT marketplace – a venue for trading and exchanging non-fungible tokens.  Dennis Hui, co-founder at Powerbomb Finance, said he thinks the speculation may have started when someone saw the Loopring GitHub and realized there’s code being worked on that involved GameStop.  Some traders might also see Loopring as a play on metaverse development, which has become a hot topic following Facebook’s rebrand to Meta to focus on future incarnations of the Internet.  “Anytime a mainstream public-listed company, in this case, GameStop, wants to do something metaverse -elated, the market responds positively,” Hui said.  Much of the hype around NFTs at the moment links back to speculation over the future of the metaverse, Hui said.  “It’s a hot buzzword, with Microsoft, Nike, Alibaba and Facebook all announcing some metaverse-related direction in their products,” Hui said.  At press time, LRC was trading at $3, up 157% in the last seven days and 685% so far in November. The market capitalization is now $3.9 billion.  What is Loopring?  Loopring runs on the Ethereum network, specifically on layer 2 zero knowledge rollups (zkRollups). Layer 2 refers to a secondary protocol that builds on top of an existing system, in this case, on top of Ethereum. ZkRollups allow blockchains to validate transactions faster whilst ensuring that gas fees are minimal. They combine processes handled both on-blockchain and off-blockchain.  “ZkRollups are becoming increasingly popular among developers, investors and traders looking for faster and cheaper transaction processing,” said a report by CoinMarketCap.  Loopring’s token price started gaining traction in cryptocurrency markets in late October, soon after announcing plans to support NFT minting, trading and transfers, directly on the layer 2.  DappRadar’s Dunica said that “GameStop has a powerful voice on Reddit, where these sorts of rumors tend to start.”  “It’s not surprising to see investors getting excited,” he said.  According to Hui: “Looking forward, for as long as Ethereum remains slow, expensive and jammed up, there’s a case for layer 2s.”",POSITIVE,LRC,BUSINESS | ETH | LRC | MARKET | TRADING,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/12/loopring-price-up-7-fold-this-month-on-gamestop-speculation-metaverse-bets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/27c26a89118449b9e8a6204661246bc8d804d095-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Many DeFi applications run on the Ethereum network and use its native token, ether (ETH-USD), the world&apos;s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Ether&apos;s (ETH-USD) price has soared 552% so far this year, far outpacing bitcoin&apos;s (BTC-USD) 121% gain. DeFi growth on the Ethereum blockchain has surged 780% this year, in dollar terms, reflecting the ether price rally, the team led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said in their report. But by volume, ether (ETH-USD) tokens used in DeFi increased at a slower, yet still strong, 50% rate in 2021, they added.

WazirX recorded trading volume of over $38 billion year to date, equating to average monthly growth of 44%, the exchange announced on Friday.  The company reported growth of 2,648% in user signups from Tier II and Tier III cities - in other words, large cities in the country except the six biggest: Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad.  The strong user growth was also backed by tremendous adoption by women in Tier II and Tier III cities, the company said.  The exchange’s performance this year demonstrates the growing popularity of crypto in India despite lingering uncertainty about whether it would be banned by the government.  At the start of this year, India’s government was set to ban private crypto outright, but has since pivoted to a position of regulating it as an asset class.  WazirX, alongside other crypto players, has been invited to meet with the government next week to share its views on the industry.

However, Ramji, who sits on BlackRock’s global executive committee, also said the asset manager is holding back on launching cryptocurrency ETFs due to the “opaque” regulatory framework and liquidity concerns.  In May, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said the asset manager is studying the potential of cryptocurrencies to serve as long-term investments though it’s too early to tell if they’re “just a speculative trading tool” due to their volatility.  In October, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first bitcoin futures ETF, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange.  “I also think that before we wrap or put our brand on it, we want to be certain that clients are going to be happy with us five years from now, 10 years from now,” Ramji told the publication.

The cryptocurrency fell 27% to $12.70 as exchange inflows spiked in what appeared to be a classic “sell the fact” reaction to Boba Network’s completion of a snapshot for an airdrop, or free BOBA coins, to OMG holders.  OMG hit its lowest price since Oct. 28, falling below the 50-day moving average (MA) support after 3 1/2 months, CoinDesk 20 data shows.  Blockchain data shows investors transferred coins to exchanges in large numbers early today, possibly to liquidate holdings.  Centralized exchanges registered a net inflow of 5.7 million OMG tokens on Friday – the largest influx on record. Increased transfer of coins to exchanges represents investor intention to sell, while continued outflow is a sign of solid holding sentiment.  The price sell-off and exchange inflows picked up the pace during Asian trading hours after Boba Network, a new layer 2 product created by blockchain developer Enya in collaboration with OMG Network, announced a snapshot – a Polaroid record – of balances held by OMG holders on the Ethereum network and the Boba Network.  On Nov. 19, these recorded wallets will receive free BOBA governance tokens in proportion to their OMG holdings at the snapshot time.  The price drop comes after a strong rally that saw prices reach a three-year high of $20 earlier this month. The cryptocurrency picked up a bid near $6 last month as the lure of making free money from the impending Boba Network airdrop drew demand. OMG also benefited from the broad-based rally in coins associated with Ethereum layer 2 projects and Ethereum alternatives like Solana and Polkadot.  The uptick in the lead-up to the airdrop snapshot and the subsequent sell-off is related to the “buy the rumor, sell the fact” trade often observed in stock markets and recently seen in bitcoin. The concept is based on the belief that market participants, being forward-looking, tend to buy an asset when expecting positive developments and take profit, driving the market lower on confirmation of the news.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | AIRDROP,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/12/omg-tanks-over-25-as-exchanges-see-record-inflows-after-boba-airdrop-snapshot,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/51d17c37c0ce458e1c8c0f1fd9a571f19119bc98-1848x1244.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

There is a good reason behind the popularity of the phrase, &apos;don&apos;t put all your eggs in one basket&apos; when it comes to assets. One basket, in this case, would be equivalent to investing in only one asset - and if the value of that one asset falls to zero, the whole investment can be lost. Choosing to invest in multiple assets is known as &apos;diversification&apos;. This can be done by either investing in multiple asset classes or by investing in multiple different assets within one asset class. Asset classes differ from one another in the nature of the source of their value. For instance, commodity funds invest in raw materials or primary agricultural products, whereas Forex is a money market asset in which foreign currencies are traded. In the event of one of the assets failing, a diversified portfolio can help to prevent big losses. You would have the ability to significantly offset the loss of the falling asset if you had other investments. However, in order for this to work effectively, the correlation between the assets in a potential portfolio must be taken into account. An everyday life example of correlation would be that during winter, the sale of coats would go up. Therefore, cold weather and coat sales are positively correlated.

The market opens up a new frontier where crypto enthusiasts can enjoy an exciting gaming ecosystem while receiving rewards simply for participating in the metaverse. NFT-based games that integrate play-to-earn elements are among the fastest-growing sectors in the developing crypto space. They promise to overhaul the existing pay-to-play structures implemented by traditional incumbents like Nintendo, Atari, Microsoft and many more. These old-fashioned businesses rely on in-game purchases to generate revenues and grow their platforms while offering players little to no return. Unlike these traditional gaming models, the crypto gaming industry offers users financial incentives through gameplay. This approach has enabled the burgeoning sub-sector to become a sensation in the crypto and blockchain industry. Participants can mint and trade rare in-game tokens (NFTs) that they can leverage to earn crypto-assets and fiat currencies on exchanges outside the metaverse. NFT gamers worldwide can earn rare, immutable tokens with tremendous upside potential that they can trade in decentralized marketplaces for in-game perks such as avatars and accessories.

42396546,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT497f,1636701089,Ether’s Key Metrics Paint Bearish Picture: Santiment,"While ether, the native token of Ethereum’s blockchain, remains on an upward trajectory, metrics like active addresses and trading volumes have decoupled from the token’s rising price. According to blockchain analytics firm Santiment, those negative divergences indicate the possibility of a price pullback.  Ether’s daily (24-hour) active addresses, a proxy for user participation, peaked above 670,000 at the end of October and has been declining ever since then, diverging from the cryptocurrency’s rising price.  Network usage affects the demand for cryptocurrency and can influence its price. An uptick in the number of active addresses along with a price increase is said to confirm an upward trend. So, analysts often question the sustainability of price gains whenever the price rally is accompanied by a drop in active user participation on the network.  Another reason to be cautious is the strong divergence between prices and trading volumes seen in the chart below.  While ether continues to chart higher lows and higher highs, a sustained pickup in daily trading volumes remains elusive. According to technical analysis theory, a low-volume rally is often short-lived.  A similar bearish divergence is seen in ether’s social volume, a metric representing the degree of crowd chatter about ether on various social media channels, including Telegram groups and crypto subreddits.  “A bunch of long-lasting divergences is pointing us to the idea that we need to go down,” Santiment noted in a market insights post published early on Friday. “These are really worrying.”  “There is 50/50 chance market quite often moves up one more time after divergence ... just to confuse traders,” Santiment said, adding that there could be one more push higher before a crash.  Ether’s technical indicators also reveal that upward momentum might not last.  The daily MACD histogram, an indicator used to gauge trend strength and trend changes, is predicting lower highs, contradicting the higher price trend. The divergence indicates a weakening of bullish momentum and often precedes a drop in price.  That said, a pullback, if any, could be shallow and short-lived, as ether may be facing a supply squeeze, as noted in Tuesday’s First Mover newsletter.  Ether was trading at about $4,745 at press time, representing a 10% gain for the month.

42396536,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT48xp,1636676270,Binance Freezes Doge Withdrawals as Users Report Being Asked to Return Coins They Don’t Have,"Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, has temporarily suspended withdrawals of DOGE following an upgrade, the company said Thursday.  “We discovered a minor issue with DOGE network withdrawals on Binance after carrying out a version update on 2021-11-10,” Binance said in a post on Thursday morning without specifying what the “minor issue” was. “As a result, we have temporarily suspended DOGE network withdrawals until this issue is resolved. Binance is actively working with the DOGE project team to resolve the issue.”  But the upgrade appears to have created significant problems for some of Binance’s users. Those users claim that the crypto exchange first initiated the withdrawal of dogecoin without their consent, and is now asking the users to return the dogecoin that they don’t have in their Binance accounts.  Screenshots shared with CoinDesk by several Binance users show that Binance asked them to return DOGE to the exchange, or else their withdrawal function on the exchange would remain deactivated. But the affected users said they didn’t even have any DOGE in their Binance accounts to return.  In a tweet thread on Thursday by a Twitter account representing dogecoin developers, the developers explained that the initial withdrawal transactions appear to have been follow-up attempts to carry out requested transactions from years ago that were “stuck” because of “insufficient fees.”  The Dogecoin network upgrade initiated a few days ago appears to have triggered those old transactions, according to the tweet thread. On the upgrade’s GitHub page, it says the upgrade made final “a new minimum fee recommendation” for all participants on the network; the developers therefore believe that the transactions that got stuck appear to have been retried, even when the users no longer own the coins.  The Dogecoin developers claimed that they tried to work with Binance when the exchange first reached out over a year ago on the “stuck transactions,” but they “were not notified as to whether or not [Binance] followed” their instructions to fix the problem.  Binance didn’t immediately respond to requests for more information about the issue.",NEGATIVE,DOGE,DOGE | EXCHANGE | TRADING | BNB,"Muyao Shen, Anna Baydakova",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/11/12/binance-freezes-doge-withdrawals-as-users-report-being-asked-to-return-coins-they-dont-have,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dd8810878dc04aa2277a04298788f2cc47eb6ab2-2124x1411.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
