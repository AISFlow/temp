42425628,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIebzh,1399115718,"10 Celebrities Investing in, Using and Talking About Bitcoin","Bitcoin “is going to change the world from a money transactional standpoint not just for Africa, but for everywhere”, said recording artist and producer Akon at the Milken Global Conference this Wednesday (30th April).  His declaration is the latest of celebrity endorsements helping the technology and digital currency gain trust among the general public.  The support of influencers like Marc Andreessen – the entrepreneur, software engineer and co-founder of Netscape who now heads venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz – and adoption by businesses like Overstock.com has been exciting for those in the bitcoin world waiting to see it gain mass-market adoption.  No matter the reason or the scale, stars of the entertainment and sports industries are slowly giving bitcoin their nods of confidence, and many hope the world’s skepticism shifts with theirs.  Here are 10 celebrity figures investing in, using and talking about bitcoin.      Ashton Kutcher  Actor Ashton Kutcher is the co-founder of venture fund A-Grade Investments, who have invested in BitPay, the payment processor that allows merchants to accept bitcoin payments.  Speaking at the TechCrunch Disrupt NY conference last year, he said: ""The bigger thing with bitcoin is: what can that decentralised technology really do? […] Imagine if we could decentralise that issue of security, and if we can decentralise security.""  ""The notion that we could civically monitor each other in an anonymous way actually keeps the anonymity of the Internet, we don’t have to worry about Big Brother and that same infrastructure that built out bitcoin could be used in the security industry for mass good,"" he added.  Kutcher has been successful as a venture capitalist in the tech space following an offer by Andreessen, with whom he has since become close, in 2009 to invest in Skype.  He has also invested Spotify, Airbnb, Foursquare and Uber.      Nas  Rapper and songwriter Nas, along with his manager Aymen Anthony Saleh, are investors in more than 40 startup companies including digital wallet company Coinbase and 500 Startups, the Silicon Valley incubator accelerating bitcoin companies. And they're just getting started.  Last year, Coinbase raised $25 million in Series B funding led by Andreessen Horowitz, thanks to whom Nas and Saleh learned how to approach and assess their potential investment opportunities. The firm’s partner Ben Horowitz is close with them, according to Saleh.      Lily Allen  Earlier this year, singer Lily Allen confessed that she blindly declined the opportunity to perform a live gig on the virtual world website Second Life for £6 million paid in bitcoin. Given the timing and venue, however, it's more likely the offer was for Second Life currency Linden dollars rather than bitcoin.  She tweeted originally:    About 5 years ago someone asked me to stream a gig live on second life for hundreds of thousNds of bitcoins, ""as if"" I said. #idiot #idiot      — Lily Allen (@lilyallen) January 5, 2014        Mel B  Last Christmas former Spice Girl and X Factor judge Mel B partnered with London-based CloudHashing to become the first musical artist to accept bitcoin to purchase her music.  ""I love how new technology makes our lives easier, and to me, that’s exciting,"" she said. ""Bitcoin unites my fans around the world using one currency. They can just pay using bitcoins.""  CloudHashing offers bitcoin-mining-as-a-service.  The company had a booth at the Austin music and technology conference SXSW this year to showcase their service to industry icons and enthusiasts still new to bitcoin.      Donald Glover  Upon the release of his latest album, ""Because the Internet"", actor and rapper Donald Glover, better known by his stage name Childish Gambino, gave an interview in which he talked about the pre-Internet, the future of the Internet, and declared that ""we should definitely start looking at currency on the Internet.""  Responding to a follow-up question, he said:    ""Yeah, I know a lot of people are skeptical, but I feel like if everything’s going to live online, why not bitcoins? Being backed by gold seems very old and nostalgic to me.      Being backed to a bitcoin, which takes time to actually make and there’s this equation that has to be done, that feels realer to me and makes more sense.""        Roseanne Barr  Actress and comedian Roseanne Barr, made famous by her eponymous sitcom and who has since run for president, among other political involvements, began publicly backing bitcoin last spring.  Earlier this year, she urged her Twitter followers to inform themselves on the digital currency, so they might do the same:    hey, all: let's really understand #bitcoin it might be better than removing the federal reserve, and faster way 2 end satanic ritual rule.      — Roseanne Barr (@therealroseanne) January 9, 2014        Drew Carey  Actor and comedian Drew Carey tweeted about bitcoin last year, gently encouraging wider bitcoin adoption at least in the food and beverage industry.    Just tried to buy breakfast w bitcoins. Refused. #whenwilltheworldcatchuptomyhipness?      — Drew Carey (@DrewFromTV) April 7, 2013    While finding restaurants that accept bitcoin is still significant, just one year later hundreds of businesses are now familiar with it, and some accept bitcoin payments and have been very pleased by its effects on business.  Those featured on the online merchant directory Yelp can now even indicate if they accept bitcoin.      Richard Sherman  This January Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman announced on Facebook that his official online store would begin accepting bitcoin payments, calling it “the currency of the future.”      Post by Richard Sherman.        ""The decision was based on supporting the fan-base choices to transact via the latest medium — not unlike PayPal or traditional credit cards,"" Sherman's agent said in an interview.          Chad ‘Ochocinco’ Johnson    A tweet last month by former National Football League star Chad Johnson asking how to use bitcoin shows that he is at least thinking about how to incorporate it into his daily life.      Discussing the concept of @Bitcoin with a friend. Can y'all show me how easy it is? #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/blS4OVPe37      — Chad Johnson (@ochocinco) April 14, 2014    Johnson currently plays Canadian football for the Montreal Alouettes.  The tweet came shortly after the Sacramento Kings revealed that they too would begin accepting the digital currency online for purchases of fan gear, merchandise and tickets.  The NBA team was the first major sports team in the US to do so. The San Jose Earthquakes soccer team has also embraced bitcoin.      Snoop Dogg  In a tweet last December, rapper and singer-songwriter Snoop Dogg teased that his next album would be “available in bitcoin"" and ""delivered in a drone"".  Although the tweet was facetious, he responded more seriously to Bitpay and Coinbase when they reached out to him offering their services.  Snoop Dogg's representatives later said in an interview that he was not serious about accepting bitcoin, but the news brought waves of attention to the digital currency by the general public.

42425619,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIebhh,1399112110,New SMS Bitcoin Service Aims at Emerging Markets,"Singapore-based payment processor CoinPip is introducing new payment options, allowing anyone in the world to send coins via SMS.  It integrates seamlessly with the 'SMSwallet' system developed by US-based 37coins, which itself is aimed at developing and emerging markets where access to smartphone and desktop PC apps is limited.  It allows consumers to pay in bitcoin via any CoinPip Merchant POS from any mobile device with SMS functionality.  Anson Zeall, co-founder of CoinPip, is planning to expand across Hong Kong and Indonesia within the next month or so.  His company's vision is to make bitcoin and other digital currencies as safe and easy-to-use as any other form of money. He also has sights set on other regions in Southeast Asia where 3G mobile connections are limited, adding:  ""The mobile market in Southeast Asia is massive but the usage of smartphones is still lagging. So QR code scanning is not that useful. Thus the collaboration with 37coins is going to make payments more convenient for everyone else.""  Getting started  To beging using a 37coins bitcoin SMS wallet, mobile users simply need to visit www.37coins.com and enter a mobile number in countries where the service has been launched.  Once confirmed, the gateway can then be opened by anyone from any location and users can send and receive bitcoin from anywhere with mobile access.  CoinPip also recently launched an online API for merchants that want to accept bitcoin online and uploaded its merchant POS app to the Google Play store.    CoinPip Merchant allow merchants in some Southeast Asia region countries to accept bitcoins, and receive in their local currency. Instant exchange is available in Hong Kong and Singapore, while an on-demand exchange is available for an extra fee in Australia, China (ex Hong Kong), Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. CoinPip has plans to add more countries soon.  Where instant exchange is available, bitcoins are converted to local currency and deposited into merchants' bank accounts daily. Users can track orders using their CoinPip account online and view transactions on an Android device. It also allows businesses to refund customers in bitcoin or local currency as required.  37Coins  37coins' aim is to make bitcoin easy, secure to use, and accessible to everyone. It is similar to Kenya's M-Pesa mobile payment system, a leapfrogging technology that uses the country’s fiat currency. However, 37coins uses bitcoin and can potentially be used anywhere in the world.  Based in the US, 37coins' focus is on connecting the world's 'other four billion’ to the global economy with low-tech, secure, scalable solutions and apps aimed at low-end Android devices. It does so without requiring any new infrastructure or hardware.  37coins.com was founded by social entrepreneur Songyi Lee, developer Johann Barbie and designer Jonathan Zobro.  “The 37coins gateway system is distributed, and modeled after bitcoin itself. A person that deploys a gateway gets a tiny percentage of the transaction which turns it into an entrepreneurial opportunity,"" said Barbie.  ""It’s simple and is even usable on the Nokia 100, this basic SMS phone. While M-Pesa is just in Kenya, 37coins can work anywhere in the world,"" added Zobro.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/05/03/new-sms-bitcoin-service-aims-at-emerging-markets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/231f55f835e5cf3923bfc5e270c0110e1cd734af-994x551.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
