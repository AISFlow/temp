42398273,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSvcq,1424818856,New Hampshire Lawmakers Debate Accepting Bitcoin for Tax Payments,"The New Hampshire state legislature held a pair of hearings earlier this month that focused on how the state could create a means for residents to pay taxes and fees using bitcoin.  Up for debate is a bill recently filed by state representative Eric Schleien that would open the door for the state to accept bitcoin. The bill is currently being weighed by the New Hampshire General Court Ways and Means Committee.  If passed, the bill would allow New Hampshire to partner with a bitcoin company to accept bitcoin payments and receive US dollars. Similar efforts are underway in states like Utah to explore or take the first steps toward some kind of digital currency acceptance.  The committee met on the 12th and 17th of February to hear testimony from a number of local bitcoin activists and politicians. Speakers included Schleien, former gubernatorial candidate Andrew Hemingway, Ziftr CEO Bob Wilkins, as well as other state residents speaking both in support of and against the bitcoin payments bill.  Schleien, who has described the proposal as a conversation starter and a means to spread awareness of bitcoin in the state legislature, provided similar comments in his statements.  Schleien told the committee:  “If New Hampshire can lead the way in the primary process, and we can lead in other ways, why don’t we lead the way to being the first state to actually implement a process? It’s going to happen, all 50 states are going to do this. Why don’t we be the first?”  Many questions brought up by the committee members focused on the general nature of bitcoin, echoing similar hearings held by states such as New York and New Jersey.  Bitcoin battles risk associations  A frequent point of contention was whether the state would incur unnecessary risk by accepting bitcoin as a means of payment or relying on a third party to facilitate bitcoin transactions. Some members of the panel voiced scepticism about bitcoin as both a currency and a technology, whereas others seemed more open to the concept.  The role of bitcoin exchanges in the payment process was mentioned by several committee members, including Representative Bill Ohm who expressed concern that potential disruptions in the bitcoin market might complicate the state’s ability to receive a payment.  “Is the state taking a risk by accepting a bitcoin that there may not be a market for at the time they want to sell it for cash?” he asked.  During testimony, Ziftr CEO Wilkins acknowledged the risk of low liquidity in the bitcoin market but remarked that, under the law, the process of exchange would happen between the resident and a third-party.  Wilkins suggested, as others did during the hearings, that New Hampshire work with processors that hold sufficient capital and insurance to ensure the security of payments.  Opposition strikes critical note  Though many of the individuals who offered testimony during the two days of hearing were in support of the bill, some opposed the idea.  New Hampshire Liberty Party co-founder Darryl Perry spoke out against the bill, arguing that what he described as “contradictory” federal regulations make accepting bitcoin a controversial choice. Perry also noted that neither the federal government or New Hampshire accept precious metals like gold and silver – commodities often compared to bitcoin – for payment.  “Where does this end? Will we go down this slippery slope to any thing of value, and then could I take a carton of eggs and pay my $5 parking ticket?” Perry asked the panel.  Perry also spoke against mechanisms by which the state government can collect funds from state residents.  “I don’t want it to be easy for the collection of fees,” he said.  Recordings of the New Hampshire hearings, filmed by the libertarian organization Free Keene, can be found below.

42398227,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSvR2,1424809242,Europol: Bitcoin's Popularity Growing in Illicit Online Markets,"Bitcoin is increasingly being used to pay for livestreams of child sex broadcasted over illicit Internet sites, according to a new Europol report.      Produced by Europol's EC3 cybercrime centre, the report sheds new light on the commercial sexual exploitation of children online, while providing evidence that individuals with a sexual interest in children are becoming more entrepreneurial.      ""Live streaming of abuse for payment is no longer an emerging trend but an established reality"", the report said.      It continued:      ""There is a clear shift from traditional credit card payments to the ones providing the most anonymity, namely alternatively payment options, including virtual currency.""              In line with the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children's (ICMEC) findings, the report said that ""there is apparent migration of commercial child sexual exploitation, along with other criminal enterprises, from the traditional payments system to a new, largely regulated digital economy made up of hosting services, anonymising Internet tools and pseudonymous payment systems"".      The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) identified 22 websites hacked with commercial templates exclusively accepting bitcoin in July last year. The news comes after Europol issued a report on Internet crime in 2014, in which it outlined a number of scenarios involving bitcoin.      The report, called the Internet Organised Crime Threat Assessment (iOCTA), examined the use of bitcoin on various dark web sites, organised crime and individuals, and called digital currencies an ""enabler"" for cybercriminals as well as a challenge for law enforcement.

42398233,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSvWw,1424802019,Boston Fed Researchers: We’re Bullish on Bitcoin as a Technology,"The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston became one of the first members of the US central banking system to issue an in-depth paper on bitcoin last September that suggested the digital currency was emerging as a cost-effective online shopping tool.  Fast forward to today, however, and the number of large merchants entering the bitcoin ecosystem seems to be stagnating. Though major e-commerce players such as Dell and Overstock are expanding the payment option overseas, there has yet to be a billion-dollar merchant of their stature to begin accepting bitcoin in 2015.  In a new interview, Boston Fed researchers Stephanie Lo and J Christina Wang indicate that they remain interested in developments in the bitcoin space, and that they have noted a number of reasons why bitcoin’s use case in online commerce may have become less compelling since the publication of their original report, 'Bitcoin as Money?'  Lo and Wang told CoinDesk:  “One likely explanation is that saving on transaction costs is only one factor in a merchant's decision whether to adopt bitcoin. We can easily imagine that bitcoin represents a technology that is still considered too risky and that may well deter some merchants from adopting it.”  In their report, Lo and Wang found that merchants were offering discounts to bitcoin users, in part, because of the lower processing costs the payment method offered, a factor they asserted made online payments perhaps the most attractive use case for bitcoin.  Still, Lo and Wang suggest that recent trends signal that bitcoin suffers from a perception problem and that the majority of merchants do not yet see how it could be a beneficial payment tool.  “Some established large-scale retailers can already negotiate very low rates with mainstream processors, so the potential savings if they were to adopt bitcoin would not be that great for them, more easily offset by the greater risk,” Lo and Wang theorized.  The comments come at a time when some in the bitcoin industry are casting doubt on the idea that bitcoin can compete against credit cards, and that the technology might be best suited toward use cases such as micropayments and remittances.  The Boston Fed is one of 12 district banks that comprise the US Federal Reserve System, responsible for US states including Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont and parts of Connecticut.  E-commerce questions  Lo and Wang went on to suggest that, while advantageous when compared to credit cards, the bitcoin network has yet to hit the scale where its benefits can be as easily realized.  The researchers painted bitcoin as less costly for users, but said that such a benefit is outweighed by the fact that credit cards are more widely accepted.  “One major advantage of bitcoin is its low transaction cost to the user once he or she has set up wallet accounts, but it is useful to the recipient only if bitcoin is accepted in most of the places he or she shops, and assuming merchants don't charge much of a premium for using bitcoin,” Lo and Wang stated.  Also a factor, the researchers said, is the added hassle bitcoin consumers must incur when exchanging local currency for bitcoin. However, they still indicated that mass acceptance is likely the most pressing roadblock today.  “We can deduce that if bitcoin doesn't make further inroads in terms of acceptance in multiple countries, especially those relying more heavily on remittance, then it will be hard for bitcoin to compete,” the researchers added.  However, in this industry too, Lo and Wang suggested that bitcoin may be no more competitive than other FinTech solutions.  “We’ve heard stories of how bitcoin can help users avoid fees when sending funds to family abroad, or how bitcoin makes it easier to pay a friend back without using cash, although, with services like Venmo, the advantage of bitcoin in this space is limited,” the researchers said.  Bullish on technology  Though critical of bitcoin in many respects, the Boston Fed researchers added the caveat that they remain “bullish on bitcoin as a technology”, though not as a currency.  “A currency would ideally have a stable value and be accepted as payment nearly universally, yet bitcoin has a ways to go in this sense,” they said.  Still, the researchers say they believe bitcoin is “useful for payments” as it can help merchants avoid transaction costs. Further, they suggested that the technology has been effective at least at waking up the financial world to new ideas on how payments can work.  “Bitcoin's presence has demonstrated that a separate system outside the existing established payment system is a very real possibility, and it has emboldened potential entrants as well as galvanized at least some incumbents,” the researchers said.  They went on to suggest that bitcoin, even if unlikely to succeed, will prove ""valuable in stimulating innovations"".  Conceptual shortcomings  While Lo and Wang regard bitcoin to be a valuable experiment, they echoed many of their original findings, suggesting they still believe bitcoin's distributed mining network to be inefficient and, as a result, a factor that likely holds bitcoin back in the long term.  “Distributed transaction processing would be counted as a conceptual shortcoming to the extent we want efficiency in our payment systems. It expends far more energy and (possibly other resources as well) than necessary for processing a given number of transactions,” Lo and Wang said.  The researchers went on to reiterate their scepticism that bitcoin's mining network is likely to succeed at staying decentralised, adding that they believe transaction processing will become increasingly consolidated.  ""The potential risk of such concentration of processing power is that the system is vulnerable to possible collusion and manipulation,"" the researchers continued.  Still, they acknowledged that bitcoin today could be seen as beneficial, regardless of its merits, to those with particular tastes.  “We know people can have objectives other than mere efficiency. Say if participants really don't like having a central processing agent, such as financial institutions, then there would be reason to have a processing technology configured like in the current bitcoin setup,” the researchers said.  Payments protocols here to stay  Most problematic, they argue, is that bitcoin as a currency has no backing, meaning its value could be caught in a “downward spiral” should users begin doubting the ability of the network to prosper in the long run.  In their original writings, Lo and Wang were more effusive in their praise for distributed payment networks such as Ripple, those that are agnostic to any one currency and therefore less subject to the rise and fall in value of any currency on the network.  Lo and Wang indicated that bitcoin has at least made obvious that a transaction network in which different components of the system can communicate would be beneficial, adding that “the existing mainstream payment system fails along this dimension”.  However, the future they see is still one where a number of protocols comprise the payment system, and that the ""lasting legacy"" of bitcoin is in how payments can use protocols to better facilitate payments and transfers.  “The way forward is to have one or at most a few protocols that govern all transmission of payment data,” the researchers concluded.

42398242,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSvdp,1424798417,Bucks to Bitcoin: Top Exchange Platform Fees Compared,"UPDATE (26th February 16:26 GMT): Bitstamp has announced it will implement a new fee structure on 2nd March.      Whether you fancy trying your hand at trading the digital currency for the first time, or want to use it as an easy, cheap and fast method of payment, you're going to have to buy some bitcoin.  That will likely mean using one of the many online exchange and trading platforms that are vying for your custom. But how much do these companies charge to swap dollars for bitcoin? And how do the various services compare?  CoinDesk looked at seven of the biggest USD bitcoin exchanges/trading platforms to find out just that.  Breaking down the fees  We started off with an imaginary buyer, Alice, who wants $1,000-worth of bitcoin.  After compiling the data on the fees of all seven platforms, we put together this comparative chart showing the fees typically incurred by a $1,000 transaction.  As can be seen, for buyers that incur the maximum 0.5% fee, ItBit proved to be the most expensive out of all the exchanges surveyed. It was closely followed by Bitstamp. Bitfinex, BTC-e and OKCoin were all considerably cheaper, while Coinbase and LocalBitcoins were free.  It should be noted that Coinbase plans to charge a fee from 1st April, however.  Exchanges at a glance  Bitfinex  This bitcoin trading platform is currently available in beta and is owned and operated by iFinex Inc.  The platform, which is being prepared to operate under a fully licensed model, offers three main functions with three different types of wallets that work together.  At the time of press, the exchange had a trading volume of 1,557,657 BTC for the last 30 days.  Users are able to trade bitcoins by placing a buy or sell offer in the Bitfinex orderbook. The order will then be executed once it is matched against an appropriate offer. The exchange wallet is used for this feature.  Fees are up to a maximum of 0.2%, depending on the order type and amount.  Bitfinex  's margin trading feature allows users to borrow funds from peer liquidity providers to trade bitcoins. Traders must note that they are always held responsible for the accrued interest, at the rate in effect for the loan(s) involved in each position they take.  The liquidity feature works in conjunction with the margin trading feature, but offers safer investments to non-traders, by allowing them to use their deposit wallets to provide liquidity in the form of bitcoins and/or dollars.  Alistair Milne  , an Altana Wealth portfolio manager, said:  ""Bitfinex is the trader's choice, unless you want to use futures or far higher leverage. Their fees are quite low and without tiers.""  Arthur Hayes BitMEX co-founder and CEO, said: ""Bitfinex is my preferred spot exchange because they are the most liquid globally for bitcoin/USD.""  Bitstamp  The Bitstamp exchange, which is run by prominent bitcoiner and CEO Nejc Kodrič, was originally set up in Slovenia, but shifted its operations to the UK two years ago.  The was founded as an European-focused alternative to the then-dominant exchange Mt Gox, which has since collapsed.  Bitstamp  had the third largest trading volume at press time (504,328 BTC).  Milne said:  ""Bitstamp is good, as it has some simple functionality for non-traders who are not worried about limit orders and such. However, their fees start at 0.5%, much higher than elsewhere. They also take 0.1% on deposits.""  The exchange also asks its users to note its policy regarding fee calculation.  It states:  ""As our fees are calculated to two decimal places, all fees which might exceed this limitation are rounded up. The rounding up is executed in such a way, that the second decimal digital is always one digit value higher than it was before rounding up.""  The exchange was hacked earlier this year, resulting in the loss of approximately $5.1m-worth of bitcoin. It has since said it will reimburse users who lost funds.  BTC-e  The popular and secretive European exchange, rumoured to be based out of Bulgaria, is one of the largest bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchanges.  Milne said:  ""We don't use BTC-e due to the cost of getting money onto the exchange. Even when making a wire transfer, the cost is at least 1%. The is one of the reasons bitcoin prices on that exchange are usually a little lower than elsewhere.""  Users who trade less than 500 BTC, are subject to a 0.20% fee.  The platform also offers percent allocation management module (PAAM) accounts, effectively allowing site traders to become money managers for other users, and enabling them to follow a trading strategy.  The exchange suffered a powerful distributed denial of service (DD0S) attack against its servers in April last year.  Coinbase  San Francisco-based Coinbase is a bitcoin wallet provider, as well as an exchange service. It was founded by Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam.  Coinbase  users are able to buy and sell bitcoin at the current market rate with bank transfers both in the United States and 18 European countries.  Credit cards are supported for some users.  The company aims to make the process easier for non-technical customers to send and receive bitcoin payments by offering a user-friendly wallet service (online and app) for storing, sending and receiving bitcoin, along with merchant services that enable businesses to accept bitcoin payments online and fee-free payments between Coinbase accounts.  A Coinbase spokesperson said:  ""Trading fees will be cancelled until 30th March and re-instated as of 1st April. From then onwards, trading fees will be based on a maker/taker model whereby takers will incur a 0.25% charge.""  ItBit  The bitcoin exchange, co-founded by CEO Charles Cascarilla, an early bitcoin adopter with more than 15 years of experience in financial services, opened its first office in 2012.  In November 2013, the exchange expanded globally and now has offices in two key global financial markets, New York (HQ) and Singapore, and employs 32 people.  The platform has an average daily trading volume of 2,000 - 3,000 bitcoin and accounts for 5-8% of the global market share.  There are two possible scenarios in terms of transaction fees, which would depend on the trader's intentions and the current market price.  In this instance, there would be a $5 charge if the trader places a bid at or higher than the current offer price. However, the trader would actually receive a $1 credit if he or she placed a bid lower than the current offer price.  If this is not the only trade that the trader makes within a 30 day period, the fees could decrease (or the rebate could increase), if the trader's overall trading volume was higher than this one single trade.  Fees are up to a maximum of 0.5%, depending on the order type and other factors.  LocalBitcoins  Founded by Jeremias Kangas, a programmer and entrepreneur, this Finland-based company is a peer-to-peer marketplace, rather than a trading platform or exchange. The service matches users wanting to buy or sell bitcoin and had a trading volume of 65,760 at press time.  Bitcoins are stored in the LocalBitcoins web wallet, for which there are fees (""0.0001-0.0004 BTC per outgoing transfer"").  Trades are conducted without fee. However, prices are set by the sellers and may be above or below the going market rate.  LocalBitcoins was hacked earlier this year, resulting in the distribution of malware and a loss of some customer funds.  This is not the first time that the marketplace has experienced security-related problems, including an incident last year when a hacker gained access to its servers for a brief period of time. Despite this, LocalBitcoins said that no customer data had been lost.  OKCoin  OKCoin is a digital currency trading platform and exchange based in Beijing.  It was founded in June 2013, and by 2014 it had grown to become the largest bitcoin exchange in China.  Fees are up to a maximum of 0.2%, depending on the order type.  Additionally, OKCoin has a minimum withdrawal amount of $15 and all withdrawals are subject to a 0.1% fee. Individuals are allowed to withdraw a maximum of $50,000 at a time.  Emily Shanahan, international marketing manager, said:    ""We do not charge any deposit fees, other fees that are applicable are merely bank fees. In both cases, both charges are borne by the customer.""            OKCoin's chief technical officer Changpeng Zhao recently announced his departure from the company, citing a difference of direction as the impetus for his decision.      Correction: The X axis on the graph has been modified to say ""maximum purchase fee"" instead of ""withdrawal fees"". The article previously stated that ItBit was the most expensive out of the exchanges surveyed. This has now been amended to specify that for buyers that incur the maximum 0.5% fee, ItBit is the most expensive. The text now also specifies ItBit's maker-taker model.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Yessi Bello Perez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/02/24/bucks-to-bitcoin-top-exchange-platform-fees-compared,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/76b74b681c7e7ea05e97152fbaa08b9eeb420b8b-603x403.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
