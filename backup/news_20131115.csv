42376690,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6cOJR,1384555430,Tens of Millions in the UK May Be Targeted by CryptoLocker Bitcoin Ransomware,"The UK’s crime agency released an alert today after a flood of spam swept the country promoting bitcoin ransomware scourge CryptoLocker.  The National Cyber Crime Unit predicted that emails would hit tens of millions of UK customers, and that they were targeting small to medium-sized businesses in particular. “This spamming event is assessed as a significant risk,” it said.  Discovered last month, CryptoLocker is distributed by email. It includes a ZIP file attachment that infects a victim’s computer, encrypting their files, and them demanding a ransom of 2 bitcoins. That will see people paying almost £500 to get their files back. It’s likely, however, that victims at this point will choose to pay in fiat currency, which is also an option. Reports indicate that this costs $300.  CryptoLocker has become more sophisticated over the last few weeks. The perpetrators have created a Tor-shielded web site that enables victims to redownload the private keys necessary to unlock their files, rather than sending bitcoin or MoneyPak payments. It also offers a ‘second chance’ option to download their files. The software originally warned that files would be unrecoverable after 72 hours. Now, the site simply increases the ransom to 10 BTC, and the option to pay with fiat via MoneyPak is removed.  That will be of scant comfort to the poor old lady who one Bitcointalk.org contributor says he found hanging around Vancouver, BC’s bitcoin ATM on Monday. She was putting money into the bitcoin ATM and couldn’t understand why no bitcoins were coming out. The woman, who didn’t understand how a paper-based private key worked, had apparently been targeted by CryptoLocker and was trying to get her files back.  CryptoLocker, combined with Tor, provides a low risk/opportunity ratio for crooks, pointed out Mike Hearn in his post about marked coins, which was publicised on Reddit yesterday. He cited the ransomware explicitly as an example of how marked coins could be useful.  It is unclear how many people are paying with bitcoins as opposed to fiat currency to get their files back, but reports suggest that either way, they are able to unlock their files afterwards. And at least one Chamber of Commerce is advising victims to pay. With bitcoin prices over $400, it looks like a win for the criminals, and a lose for thousands of victims, at this point.  Brian Krebs has some tips for how to protect your PC.

42376701,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6cOW1,1384551186,Typhoon Haiyan: Bitcoin Startup's Philippines Appeal Tops $5.5k,"A California-based bitcoin startup has been accepting donations for relief for the typhoon-stricken Philippines. Its efforts appear to be working quite well to raise awareness for the problems the storm has created in the south-east Asian nation.  ""The Philippines bitcoin donation campaign that we're running got some great coverage from CNN Money which helped kickstart things,"" says Avish Bhama, CEO of Vaurum, which owns the bitcoin exchange Bitme that is running the donation campaign.  ""We're raising bitcoins and are donating 100% of the wallet to the Philippines Red Cross. We raised about $1,000 worth of BTC in our first day,"" he told CoinDesk.  Typhoon Haiyan, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Yolanda, is one of the deadliest tropical storms to hit the country. The United Nations is estimating that 4,460 people have been killed and 920,000 people have been displaced because of the typhoon, with at least 11 million in total affected by the storm's disruptive effects.  On the Bitme donation page, the company states that its fortune in being part of the bitcoin community has influenced its decision to try and help out in the wake of such a devastating event.  ""Given the exceptional performance of bitcoin this year, we’ve all been quite fortunate to benefit from its rise – both in terms of the return on our investment as well as the growth of the overall community,"" the statement begins.  Although the effort did quite well in its first day, increased attention has filled the donation wallet with even more of the distributed virtual currency.  On the donation page is a display of the amount of bitcoin it has received so far. At press time, there were 14.11853511 BTC in the wallet. At the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index value, that's over $5,965.  Bitme's parent company, Vaurum, is a startup building an application programming interface (API) to work with retail trading and investing. The business plan is to entice brokerages to use its technology to integrate bitcoin into their platforms, enabling investors to have access to bitcoin.  Vaurum was accepted into the Boost VC startup incubator and completed the program a few months ago. The conclusion was a graduation in the form of Boost VC's Demo Day, which Vaurum participated in, pitching its business to potential investors.  ""I think bitcoin can have a positive impact on the relief efforts in the Philippines - hopefully this campaign can contribute to that,"" said Bhama.

42376703,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6cOXH,1384540362,"Lock Up Your Lucre, the Best Democracy Bitcoins Can Buy, and Liquid Asset Conversion","Welcome to the CoinDesk Weekly Review 15th November 2013 – a regular look at the hottest, most controversial and thought-provoking events in the world of digital currency through the eyes of skepticism and wonder. Your host … John Law.  Why rob banks? It’s where the money is    It seems it was only last week that bitcoin was trading at $250. Oh, wait - it was.      Now at over $400, bubblephobia is growing apace - although the price clearly has a way to go if the flood of tweets saying “Hey, I just bought bitcoin!” is any indication.      With that sort of week-on-week growth, who wouldn’t want to punt $100 or so?    However, there’s another growth industry piggy-backing on the pecuniary picnic. A “Hong Kong” trading platform GBL - actually based in Beijing simply disappeared, along with around $4m worth of investors’ bitcoin (curiously, exactly the same current value as the infamous pizza bought by Laszlo Hanyecz in May 2010 for 11,000 btc. Perhaps GBL was just peckish.)  A week earlier, inputs.io online wallet service was hacked to the tune of (at the time) $1.2m. Daniel Cawrey has a good analysis on the burgeoning bitcoin badness, if you want more. Still more, alas, is sure to come.    There is a golden rule in security. Any system can be broken, bypassed or compromised: the most important way to stay safe is to make the attack too expensive to be worthwhile.      That’s true even for systems based on imperviously good crypto - if the attackers can’t crack that, then they’ll break into the system with the keys, create a custom piece of malware, or simply bust down your door with guns and an offer you can’t refuse. It depends what’s in it for them.    [post-quote]  With bitcoin doing its Saturn V impersonation, that equation is looking increasingly dangerous.  Back in 2010, Hanyecz could have painted his wallet key on his forehead in day-glo ink and nobody would have bothered even to write it down. Three years later, if he hadn’t bought that pie, he’d be well advised to put his PC in a bank vault.  So expect bitcoin thievery and fraud to attract ever more motivated villains, and the reports of vanishing stashes to grow ever more frequent.  For while one of the delights of cryptocurrency is that it’s independent of the banking system, it’s also independent of its security system: if you’re on your own for the good stuff, you’re on your own for the bad.  That’s just one unfortunate aspect of bubble behaviour: assets that appreciate more gently only attract a gentle increase in unwelcome attention.  That gives everyone on the side of the angels more time to develop security systems and - just as importantly - a mindset that thinks about security first, quick wins second.  If you do have an appreciable quantity of bitcoin, do spare a few minutes to think about who knows about it - remember those tweets saying “Hey, I’ve just bought bitcoin!” - how you’re keeping it, and whether it might be an idea to move it somewhere else with a better password.  (Especially beware too-good-to-be-true offers from dodgy pseudonymous characters on the Internet. John Law’s Soop-A-Sayf Bitcoin Repository And Pizzeria (Lagos) Ltd will shortly be available to host all your cryptocurrency collections. Watch this space!)  Vote early, vote often, vote bitcoin  As the recent history of the world demonstrates all too painfully, financial abuse isn’t limited to dodgy characters in the shadows.  Far more damage is done when nominally respectable pillars of the economy such as banks, brokers and insurance companies, take advantage of lax regulation to build up huge paper profits on the back of reprehensibly rancid dealings.  (John Law must admit to practical knowledge of this, following an unfortunate piece of entrepreneurship he set up 300 years ago, mixing international finance and trade. Still, Venice was nice.)  This knowledge should make everyone sensitive to potential problems to come.  With bitcoin on course to become properly respectable without losing its basic anonymity, it’s impossible to overlook the possibility that it will be enthusiastically adopted by grown-up organisations perhaps a little too eager to escape some of the more onerous rules that currently keep them on the straight and narrow.  One such may be the febrile world of American politics.  There is a near-permanent controversy over funding for political parties in most democracies, for the obvious reason that he who pays the piper calls the tunes.  Big business has all the money, while political parties exist to serve all the people. In the US, there is a constant battle to reveal the sources of funding for the incredibly expensive campaigns you have to run to be in with a shout of power.  Billionaires with agendas fight to keep their fingerprints off what pass as grass-roots campaign advertising, while activists and regulators do their best to maintain transparency.  So it is with some trepidation that John Law reads that a pressure group called the Conservative Action Fund is asking for bitcoin to be acceptable for political funding in America.  The funding regulator, the FEC, seems minded to let that happen, provided that recipients keep proper records: what could possibly go wrong?  It’s a tricky one for those who, like John Law, believe in the freedom to do what you like with your money while also being rather keen that attempts to influence the democratic process should be thoroughly accountable and above board.  The standard approach is that personal donations (usually defined as being below a certain amount) are less closely regulated than corporate ones, so limiting any bitcoin transactions to the personal level might do some good.  The best we can hope for, realistically, is that someone just keeps an eye on the total revenues from bitcoin and kicks up a fuss if it gets silly. Messy and open to all sorts of shenanigans, but that’s democracy for you.    A better approach, which makes the UK infinitely more pleasant than the US during election season, is just banning political advertising from the telly altogether apart from a few tightly controlled broadcast spots evenly distributed between the main parties.    Would never fly in the US, where freedom of speech is sacred and available to all with the cash to pay for it.  Break out the cryptoclaret  Since there’s been one confession, here’s another. When the last link is pasted and the final name checked in this column every week, John Law awards himself a large glass of something red and Gallic. No, not the French economy, it’s far more liquid than that.  Such habits, he feels, are essential to the spirit and practice of journalism. His minders at CoinDesk know this too, which is why they forwarded a press release with rather worrying haste earlier today, under the title “We thought you needed to know this”.  It’s not good form to just reprint commercial messages, but this is short and sweet and encourages the consumption of alcohol so let's be having it.  “We are the first online wine and liquor store to accept bitcoins. We sell everything from the low end to collectables. Our orders are processed within 24 hours and ship to all 50 states. I was wondering if you can let your readers know. John Ha, City Wine Cellar, NY. @citywinecellar”  Thanks, guys. It’s nice to know the American cousins are getting first shot at a service which marks a major milestone in the integration of bitcoin into truly civilised culture.  Not so nice to know that, for now, John Law will still be shlepping down to the local Waitrose to conduct some old-fashioned fiduciary with the folding fiat.  But when an equivalent service does open up under the approving gaze of Her Majesty, you can be sure that a full consumer evaluation will be made at the first opportunity.  John Law owes that to you, his loyal readers, and looks forward to coining a new phrase for the inevitable result: let's get bitfaced.  But please, remember to drink like a responsible journalist.  John Law is an 18th century Scottish entrepreneur, financial engineer and gambler.

42376707,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6cOdZ,1384533731,Anti-Theft Bitcoin Tracking Proposals Divide Bitcoin Community,"All bitcoin transactions are equal, but, to misquote Orwell, should some bitcoin transactions be more equal than others?  A proposal emerged this week that could please regulators and law enforcers alike, by ‘marking’ bitcoin transactions or addresses to make illicit activities easier to track.  And another proposal from a New York-based startup would increase regulator confidence by tying identities more closely to bitcoin addresses.  The coin marking proposal came from Mike Hearn, the chair of the Bitcoin Foundation’s Law and Policy Committee, who has had a tough day on Reddit.  He was accused of “pushing blacklists behind the scenes” in this Reddit post. The Redditor gained access to a posting that Hearn made on the Bitcoin Foundation’s internal forum, which is only accessible to members, and reposted it.  Hearn wanted to open the debate about marking bitcoins (something which he originally called “redlisting” in the post). But how would that work, and why would people do it?  Bitcoin transactions use inputs and outputs. The outputs from one transaction become the inputs for others, and so on, meaning that you can trace where your inputs came from, through the block chain.  Hearn’s idea is to identify bitcoin outputs that have been stolen or used for criminal activity, and mark them.  If an exchange gets hacked, for example, and the outputs are sent to a specific address, those outputs would be marked. They would remain marked when they were sent to new addresses, even when they were split into smaller outputs.  When a person received an output derived from an earlier output that has been marked, their bitcoin client can be programmed to alert them – even if it happened lots of transactions later.  In spite of the Redditor’s headline, Hearn is deliberately not using the term ‘blacklisting’ because he’s not advocating that any restrictions are put on the bitcoins.  “A marking scheme, such as [the one] I proposed, does not/should not affect the spendability of coins,” he said. “It's purely informational - kind of like a ‘wanted poster’ for the internet age.”  Core developers debate proposal  Core developer Gregory Maxwell seems to be against marking at all. Indeed, he invented a mechanism designed to increase the privacy of bitcoin transactions, called CoinJoin.  “If you have ‘good’ and ‘bad’ coins, that destroys fungibility, rapidly. Everyone must screen coins they accept or risk being left holding the bag,” he said, in an online post. “Fungibility is an essential property of a money like good and without it the money cannot remove transactional friction.”  Sure, but bitcoin isn’t entirely fungible, Hearn told CoinDesk.  “Bitcoins can't be forged, but they can be double-spent, in which case you might lose money you accepted,” he said.  “Thus, an unconfirmed transaction with zero fees is somehow not as good as one that is already buried under 1000 blocks. Though technically they're both bitcoins, one is superior to another.” Or, as Orwell might have said, six confirmations good, zero confirmations bad.  What about mixing services, which take bitcoin outputs and deliberately reroute them from a pool, obfuscating their source?  They represent a technical challenge, admits Hearn, because all of the outputs that pass through them would probably end up marked. But it isn’t insurmountable. A crook’s coins would almost always be marked, he points out.  “Now when the exchange sees an account that receives marked coins 80% of the time instead of 5% of the time, that's a very strong clue that maybe this guy should be investigated a little closer,” he said.  But core developer Jeff Garzik, too, is against marking. He likens bitcoin to cash.  “Cash today might be marked, such as in a bank robbery with ‘marked bills’, but your average Starbucks or other cash-accepting merchant does not check each bill received against a blacklist. That would be burdensome to individual merchants,” he said.  “We have to resist marking coins as ‘good’ or ‘bad’ at the engineering system level.” Instead, law enforcement can use existing tools such as subpoenas, and seizures on bitcoins, he says (although often with funny results).  A few months ago, Garzik had emailed CoinDesk comments for another article on taint analysis and stolen coins, and subsequently turned them into a blog post of his own here.  Regardless of what people think, shouldn’t discussions like these be played out in public, for everyone to see? The only reason that the community saw this was because someone reposted it.  “One has to keep in mind that the Foundation is a member-driven organization. Anyone is welcome to join and the cost is about 0.9 [note: later corrected to 0.06 BTC] for an annual membership,” pointed out Jinyoung Englund, spokesperson for the Foundation.  “This certainly is not prohibitive. By definition, I believe this actually makes us inclusive.” There are also no rules about sharing with non-members, she points out.  While Hearn seeks to earmark bitcoin transactions, a group of New Yorkers seem to be coming at things from another direction.  Coin Validation working with US regulators  Coin Validation  wants to develop processes to verify the identities of those holding specific bitcoin addresses, making those addresses more reliable than others for regulated companies to do business with.  Yifu Guo  (founder of Bitsyncom and Avalon Asics) got together with former BitInstant CIO Alex Waters, who recently founded Bitcoin Incubator CoinApex.  They’re working with Matt Mellon, chair of the New York Republican Party's Finance Committee, whose family has a long banking lineage. Mellon would likely give a venture like Coin Validation considerable kudos with the regulators and bitcoin businesses on its radar.  The company isn’t giving much away about how it would actually work, other than to say that it isn’t whitelisting. It’s about verification.  “Coin Validation is not involved with making whitelists or blacklists of bitcoin addresses or coins themselves,” said Guo. He has been an important figure in the bitcoin community, being among the first to offer ASIC mining equipment. However, problems with deliveries left many customers out of pocket.  Coin Validator, which describes itself in documents as providing a one-stop compliance suite for AML and KYC, is just collecting legal compliance data, he explained. If a company chooses not to serve a customer based on fraudulent activity reported by a different firm, that would be its prerogative.  “We would like to validate addresses belong to an individual in similar ways that compliance companies verify that a bank account belongs to a specific individual. We are working with regulators to standardize policy,“ continued Guo.  One obvious customer base here would be exchanges. “Verifying source of funds is an important pillar of Anti-Money Laundering practices,” said Ryan Singer, co-founder of still-benched bitcoin exchange Tradehill.  Tradehill recently ran an auction for Guo’s firm, Avalon Asic. That hardware firm will be the first to use Coin Validation’s services, according to Forbes.  “Coin Validation may be taking the first steps to having something to say about verifying sources of bitcoin deposits. I am watching closely,"" said Singer. But he’s reserving judgment until he’s seen the demo.  Not all businesses are buying the idea. Just over two miles away from Coin Validation’s offices, Jaron Lukasiewicz is trying his hardest to navigate the regulatory landscape with his new exchange, Coinsetter.  Lukasiewicz could really use trusted bitcoin addresses – he’s even mandating that his US clients use the same addresses for bitcoin deposits and withdrawals. But after considering it, he still won’t be using Coin Validation.  “Despite the hurdles we face, it would be better that identity verification for bitcoin addresses remain decentralized as opposed to giving information to one central for-profit source,” he said. “It would absolutely make it easier for us as Coinsetter, but I don’t see any consumer benefit to it at all.”  Yet like many exchanges, Coinsetter is focused on liquidity. Coin Validation would encourage that by making bitcoin safer for larger players, said Guo. “If regulators express that they are comfortable with bitcoin and bitcoin businesses operating in the US, large entities, who are very wary of legal risk, would enter the market, greatly increasing liquidity.""  What happens now?  These are two different approaches, but both of them seek to make the owners of bitcoin addresses more accountable.  The danger with either of them is that while they may be opt-in and voluntary at the start, we can't predict what might happen later.  How can we guarantee that regulators won't begin targeting bitcoin users with new requirements, once such technology platforms exist?  The camel’s nose is a long-understood metaphor, in which a seemingly innocent act can leave people open to more serious, damaging acts later on.  [post-quote]On one hand, those who believe in a completely decentralized currency and are worried about any form of centralized control want to protect itself from that, and are often suspicious of any form of intervention by a central authority.  On the other hand, those trying to build larger businesses based on bitcoin want to work with regulators to avoid punitive measures down the line.  There are two very different communities within bitcoin. The comments about Guo and Coin Validation in this thread illustrate that. Will they be able to meet in the middle?  “It's a challenge that can be overcome if we set aside the 20% we disagree on and focus on the 80% where we do agree,” argued Englund. “By identifying the priorities and goals we share, we can then develop a productive plan for moving forward together.“",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/15/anti-theft-bitcoin-tracking-proposals-divide-bitcoin-community,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2b140f81bb28fbd954f06c7fa593f314df512967-1000x750.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376700,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6cOUl,1384523936,What Exactly Does the US Government Really Think of Bitcoin? Here’s the Story so Far,"With the US Senate setting 18th November as the start date for its committee hearings into bitcoin, it’s time to take a look at some of the more significant events in bitcoin’s short but colorful legal history.  The early timeline featured hacks, heists, drugs, demands for refunds and the first appeals to law enforcement, but 2013 saw official scrutiny rise almost as quickly as bitcoin’s value.  Whether or not bitcoin requires, or should seek, regulatory approval is a major source of heated debate on bitcoin discussion forums, but the regulation issue will remain prominent as long as significant amounts of wealth are at stake.  CoinDesk's 'Is bitcoin legal?' page is a good source of information on bitcoin’s current legal status and the major regulatory players.  Stepping out of the shadows  Though early enthusiasts had already recognized bitcoin’s world-altering potential, its rise to mainstream attention was inglorious at first.  Before 2013, bitcoin was known mainly to non-participants as the currency of choice on online black marketplace Silk Road and its buffet of illegal products and services.  Bitcoin has found it difficult to shake the connection even months after Silk Road’s shutdown, with mainstream and even technology media constantly referring to the ‘link’ in almost every story about digital currency.  US Senators Chuck Schumer and Joe Manchin even called for a 'crackdown' on bitcoin in June 2011, overlooking any merits to the currency and focusing on its “untraceability” and its role in assisting criminal activity.  The US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) responded with similar concerns about anonymous digital currencies, referring to them as “emerging threats”.  In early 2012, bitcoin was still considered a hobby for technology enthusiasts, but its impact on the real-world wealth of some had caught the regulators’ attention.  ""The anonymous transfer of significant wealth is obviously a money-laundering risk, and at some level we are aware of bitcoin and other similar operations, and we are studying the mechanism behind bitcoin,"" said Steve Hudak, a spokesman for the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), in a report published in American Banker.  Bank robberies and legal disputes  Several significant bitcoin-related thefts and hacks have occurred since 2011, each one raising louder questions about the amounts of wealth at stake and a need for further regulation.  Nearly all major bitcoin players have been affected, with varying degrees of user satisfaction with outcomes.  Most of the victims were forced to close amid vows to return in glory someday, while others such as Mt. Gox and BTC-e are still operating today.  TradeHill, the second-largest bitcoin exchange at the time, shut its doors amid regulatory pressure and a six-figure legal dispute, returning investor funds in February 2012.  CEO Jered Kenna said: “Due to increasing regulation, TradeHill cannot operate in its current capacity without proper money transmission licensing.”  The news caused bitcoin’s value to fall from $5.50 to $4.40, as community members offered to donate bitcoin to the ailing company.  Another exchange, BitFloor, fell victim to a large-scale theft of 24,000 BTC in September 2012 (each worth around $12 at the time). Founder Roman Shtylman reported the theft to the FBI.  FinCEN steps in  FinCEN issued guidelines that bitcoin-related businesses counted as “Money Service Businesses” (MSBs) under US law.  This meant bitcoin businesses were now officially required to provide authorities with information about potentially suspicious transactions and introduce policies to prevent money laundering.  These regulations also affect the more centralized virtual currencies and point systems used in social networks and online games, including Facebook and Second Life.  Lack of a centralized authority meant bitcoin itself could not comply, but any business associated with its use would need to — including individual miners, if they converted their bitcoin to fiat currency.  Still not taken seriously  Despite bitcoin reaching a then-high of $266 in April 2013, people were still having trouble taking the idea of bitcoin having real value seriously.  Unfamiliar with concepts such as the block chain, distributed ledgers, mining hash rates and proof-of-work, commentators resorted to jokes about ‘virtual currency’ with no value because it somehow didn’t really exist.  “Bitcoin has worth just because a bunch of people on the internet have agreed it is worth something - like Psy,"" joked American political satirist Stephen Colbert, likening bitcoin to the South Korean entertainer responsible for Gangnam Style.  At a meeting of regulators at the New York Federal Reserve, one participant asked if bitcoin could become a viable unit of international exchange and “participants burst out laughing.”  Other bankers didn’t laugh as hard, choosing instead to start unilaterally shutting down the accounts of bitcoin exchanges like New York-based BitFloor and Ottawa-based Canadian Bitcoins.  No, it’s not monopoly money  By May, regulators had stopped chuckling and began to speculate on whether bitcoin was so serious it might need the same kind of regulation as other financial instruments.  Bart Chilton, a commissioner at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) which regulates derivatives, was quoted by the Financial Times as saying: “It’s not monopoly money we’re talking about here — real people can have real risk in these instruments, and we need to ensure that we protect markets and consumers, even in what at first blush appear to be ‘out there’ transactions.”  [post-quote]  Exactly where the authorities stood on bitcoin’s status as real money was becoming clear, though, with the Department of Homeland Security seizing around $5m in funds from Mt. Gox for being an unlicensed money transmitter and cutting the exchange off from payment processor Dwolla.  Dwolla has since made efforts to distance itself even further, ending all bitcoin support in October 2013.  Cease!  Perhaps the most bizarre regulatory move in bitcoin’s history came in June 2013, when California’s Department of Financial Institutions (DFI) sent a cease-and-desist letter, not to any bitcoin-trading business, but to the Bitcoin Foundation, claiming it “may be a money transmission business”.  Asserting it was neither a business nor a transmitter of money, the foundation responded about 10 days later with a statement that also noted bitcoin was not a payment instrument under Californian law anyway.  Here come the scams  By July 2013, bitcoin proved itself quite similar to the world’s other currencies when Texas man Trendon T. Shavers was charged by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for operating a bitcoin Ponzi scheme through his company Bitcoin Savings and Trust (BTCST).  He had promised earlier investors 7% no-risk returns, paying them with bitcoins from new investors. The SEC subsequently issued an investor alert warning specifically of the scams and risks associated with digital currencies.  Bitcoin is a currency … sort of  The following month, in response to the Shavers case, a Texas judge served up a rare actual ruling on bitcoin’s nature by declaring it “a currency or form of money”.  This ruling gave the SEC official jurisdiction over bitcoin-related matters for the first time.  However, the ruling came from a relatively low-level court and even contradicted FinCEN guidance, which “expressly stated that virtual currencies like bitcoin are not ‘currency’, such as legal tender or fiat currencies”.  FBI, please look into this  The US House of Representatives Committee on Appropriations published the Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies Appropriations bill for the 2014 fiscal year, referring to bitcoin in a report that referenced only the criminal activity surrounding its existence.  The bill directed the FBI to investigate and provide a briefing on the “nature and scale of risk posed by such an ersatz currency”.  Tell us more  At this point, authorities began to realize information-gathering was probably a more meaningful course of action than haphazard statements and rulings from disconnected legal bodies, or concerns about illegal activity.  The New York Department of Financial Services (DFS) issued subpoenas to 22 bitcoin-related companies to provide information on their operations and consumer safeguards.  Companies like BitInstant, Coinbase, Dwolla and the Winklevosses were among those summoned.  While some of the companies welcomed the opportunity to cement their legitimacy, others claimed the subpoenas were more intimidatory in nature and would stifle innovation.  The US Senate continued this line, starting August 2013, when the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs sent a letter to Janet Napolitano, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security “for information on any policies, guidance, plans and strategies they have that pertain to virtual currencies”.  The letter highlighted the rise in interest surrounding virtual currencies and their unique attributes, referencing Trendon Shavers’ Ponzi scheme, the Mt. Gox account seizures and the Winklevoss twins’ S-1 filing for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund.  Similar letters were sent to the Department of Justice, the Federal Reserve, Department of Treasury, the SEC, the Office of Management and Budget, and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission.  18th November was later confirmed as the date for the committee hearings, and several representatives from the bitcoin world were invited to testify, including the Bitcoin Foundation who will send a representative to present arguments in bitcoin’s favor.  On the upside  In something of a rare public compliment for bitcoin from the world of traditional finance, François R. Velde, senior economist of the Federal Reserve in Chicago wrote a glowing paper titled “Bitcoin: A Primer” in which he wrote bitcoin was a “remarkable conceptual and technical achievement, which may well be used by existing financial institutions.”  He further described bitcoin as an “elegant solution” to the digital currency problem and claimed its value derived from certain beliefs about the nature and function of money, and the amounts of fiat currencies traded for it.

42376704,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6cOZn,1384520588,Apple Removes Coinbase From App Store Less Than a Month After Launch,"The Coinbase iOS app, which enabled users to buy, sell and send bitcoin, has been removed from the Apple App Store less than a month after its launch.  It appears it was Apple's decision to remove the app, as Coinbase engineer Craig Hammell revealed on Hacker News that his company was not responsible for taking it down.  Another forum member suggested the app was removed for ""quality reasons"", but Hammell responded by stating: ""That wasn't the reason that Apple provided us with.""  The iOS app, which was released on 22nd October, enabled users to see how many bitcoins they have in their wallets, plus view any recent transactions.  ""We’re not sure why it was taken down and we’ve reached out to Apple to request clarification,” Brian Armstrong, Coinbase CEO and co-founder told TechCrunch.  At the time of release, Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam said: ""This was one more step in our mission to make bitcoin easier to use. Now that I have the iOS app, I use it to pay back my friends when I’m out and about since it’s so much easier than other ways to do it.""  Android users can still download the app from the Google Play Store, free of charge.  Other bitcoin wallet apps have also experienced problems with the App Store in the past, including the BitPak and Blockchain.info applications.  BitPak    Back in early May, the app's designer, Rob Sama, received a notification from Apple stating that the application had been deleted. A post by Sama on the BitPak site states: ""I had not been given any reason why, just a simple electronic notification that it had been done.""      He then received a call from Apple around a week later and was told the app had been removed because ""that bitcoin thing is not legal in all jurisdictions for which BitPak is for sale”.      Sama asked which jurisdictions bitcoin was deemed to be illegal in, and was told: “That is up to you to figure out.""      The developer decided to give up working on BitPak and focus on other projects, although he remains passionate that bitcoin wallet apps should be permitted.      ""I still believe that the most logical place for a bitcoin wallet to reside is on the mobile phone. It is extremely unfortunate that Apple has chosen to take this stand. I know that there are people working on dedicated dongles to overcome this issue. And maybe that is the way this will play out,"" Sama added.            Blockchain.info    Rated four out of five stars, the app enables users to send and receive bitcoin payments, view their wallet balances and scan paper wallets.      The first version of the app went live in early April 2012, but Apple removed it the following month with no explanation. Blockchain.info enquired why the app had been removed and Apple replied that it violated App Store View Guideline 22.1, which states:      ""Apps must comply with all legal requirements in any location where they are made available to users. It is the developer's obligation to understand and conform to all local laws.""              A version of the app, which had limited functionality, was then released on 13th April 2012, with full wallet functionality then reinstated three months later on 11th July.      A representative of Blockchain.info said his company is following the recent development surrounding the Coinbase app ""very carefully"".      ""We won't speculate as to why Apple has removed the Coinbase app but we're hopeful it has nothing to do with bitcoin and that they come back soon,"" he added.      The representative went on to say that, in the meantime, Blockchain.info ""continues to have an iPhone app loved by users and praised by geeks"".    CoinJar    Australia-based company CoinJar created a bitcoin wallet app, which was approved by Apple in October this year.      It hails the app as having:      ""… an easy-to-use interface, a super-responsive QR scanner and all the features you need to send and receive payments.            Your wallet is in the cloud, wherever you are. There's no blockchain to download and everything just works out of the box.”            Other bitcoin apps    There are a number of other applications on the app store that bitcoiners may find useful, but they don't offer wallet functionality.      Apps such as ZeroBlock and btcReport operate as bitcoin price tickers and other applications such as Bitcoin Monitor offer more in-depth information, such as mining difficulty, total number of bitcoins in circulation and the average time it takes for a new block to be mined.      CoinDesk is awaiting comment from Coinbase.

42376663,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6be4J,1384512947,Peter Thiel Claims Bitcoin Has the Potential to Change the World,"Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal and famed Silicon Valley investor, has revealed he believes bitcoin could make some serious waves in the world of finance.  Speaking at the Thiel Foundation Under 20 Summit, last weekend, Thiel said he gave a talk back in 1999 that mentioned the end of monetary sovereignty and how encrypted money was going to ""change the world"".  ""I do think bitcoin is the first one of these that has the potential to do something like that,"" he added.  The investor addressed the anti-bitcoin arguments that digital currency is ""fake"", a temporary ""bubble"" and ""doesn't represent anything real"" by stating that a lot of these arguments actually apply to the US dollar too.  ""It is worth thinking about money as the bubble that never ends. There is this sort of potential that bitcoin could become this new phenomenon,"" he continued.  Thiel hasn't always been so positive about digital currency, in fact he has been rather ambiguous in his confidence regarding bitcoin’s future.  His venture capital company Founder’s Fund led a $2m investment in BitPay in May 2013, the same week Dwolla and Mt. Gox were having their funds seized by the DHS. Yet in person he’s been less sanguine, telling German-speaking audiences and interviewers bitcoin had only a 20% chance of succeeding as a form of payment in the long-term.  It’s rare in the bitcoin universe for someone to make major investments into related companies, yet be anything less than bullish about its future. So what are his reservations?  It seems they stem not from concerns about its purpose or inherent value, but that its anonymity might provoke governments into attacking it. At the recent summit, Thiel opened up a little more on the topic. He said:  “The cautionary note I’d put on it is ... that, as far as I can tell right now, it’s being used for speculation and illegal activity – illegal payments, and therefore it is possible that it will be scrutinized in an increasingly difficult way in the years ahead.""  He described his own experience in 2000 making PayPal operable with e-gold, which issued certificates backed by real gold that could be used for anonymous payments. Upon discovering that the main use for e-gold was laundering money from credit card thefts, he disconnected it from PayPal just three months later (he was subsequently sued for libel by e-gold for stating his opinions about e-gold in a Wired interview).  e-gold was eventually shut down by the US District of Columbia after being charged with being an illegal money transmitter in 2008. Its CEO Douglas Jackson was fined $200 and sentenced to home detention, and its precious metal reserves were liquidated for $90m. Naysayers often invoke the sorry tales of illegal activity and regulation surrounding companies like e-gold, goldmoney.com and e-Bullion when talking about bitcoin.  Thiel has few kind words for governments themselves, and their history with other currency alternatives leads him to remain cautious about anonymous digital currencies. At the recent summit, he said:    “I think there is this very complicated political question around something like bitcoin where, the fact that it hasn’t been shut down would tell you something if you had an extremely competent government that quickly stopped illegal activity.      Because we do not have such a government in this country, you cannot have any reassurance that it will not be shut down at some point in the future, so I think that is still the open question with it, but it’s very interesting.”    German-born Thiel is known for his strong libertarian proclamations and for backing them up with his wallet. He’s made several six-figure pledges to Patri Freidman’s Seasteading Institute, which performs research into the feasibility of offshore, stateless colonies on artificial structures. His Thiel Fellowship offers an annual $100,000 to 20 people under the age of 20, provided they drop out of university to pursue an entrepreneurial career.  His comments in the past on the ephemeral nature of paper currencies have reflected his anti-statism, and has admitted his motivation for starting PayPal was to free currency from government intervention.  “PayPal will give citizens worldwide more direct control over their currencies than they ever had before. It will be nearly impossible for corrupt governments to steal wealth from their people through their old means because if they try the people will switch to dollars or Pounds or Yen, in effect dumping the worthless local currency for something more secure,"" he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/15/peter-thiel-claims-bitcoin-has-the-potential-to-change-the-world,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4b223b4036be4de8488dc59bfe035be83104da75-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
