42379837,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Ktgr,1504298713,BTC-e's Big Claim: Bitcoin Withdrawals to Begin Today,"BTC-e, the long-running and controversial bitcoin exchange targeted by US authorities last month, has claimed that users will be able to withdraw their funds beginning Saturday.  As previously reported, BTC-e – after its original domain had been seized by law enforcement following the arrest of a Russian national and the levying of a $110 million fine for money laundering violations – said it had secured ""55 [percent] of the funds"" originally held by the exchange, with the rest being confiscated. Yesterday, BTC-e renewed access through a new domain, allowing users to check their balances and communicate through the chat box.  In an update  , the exchange said that users would be able to withdraw the portion of their funds still available – provided that they accept a deal which would see BTC-e issue a debt token aimed at making up for the confiscated funds.  The statement reads:  ""On September 2, 2017, it will be possible to withdraw 55% of the funds from the account...on the condition that our debt obligations are abandoned to the remaining 45% of funds in the form of tokens. More details about the conditions, the principle of calculation and the form of output will be available tomorrow.""  Users that elect to keep their funds on the site, the statement goes on to explain, will have their funds transferred to an as-yet-unrevealed domain that will serve as the home for the newly-launched BTC-e.  ""On the day the site is launched, the balance will be recalculated at the market rate and will be credited to accounts with a higher ratio than 55/45....Tokens will be credited to your account balance, which you can use for bidding and releasing codes,"" the exchange said.

42379844,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KtsB,1504293938,"Russia Could Pass Cryptocurrency Law This Year, Senior Lawmaker Says","An official for Russia's national legislature believes that new laws regulating the exchange of cryptocurrencies will be complete by the end of the fall.  Anatoly Aksakov, who leads the State Duma's financial markets committee, told Russian mediahttps://pronedra.ru/government/2017/09/01/zakon-pro-kraptovalyutu/ this week that next steps involve the formation of a dedicated working group to address the issue. Further, he said that he would be meeting with officials from Russia's central bank and the Ministry of Finance in the coming days.  Should all the pieces come together – Russian officials have been working on some kind of law related to the tech since as early as 2014 – lawmakers could complete work on a legislative passage over the next several months, according to Aksakov.  He said (in translated comments):  ""If we agree on the main approaches in the coming week, I think that by autumn, by the end of the fall session, we will be able to adopt this law in order to provide a legal space for the development of this market.""  The comments come amid a flurry of news out of Russia on the cryptocurrency front. The country's deputy finance minister, for example, said earlier this week that he thinks bitcoin trading should be restricted to qualified investors. The chief internet advisor to president Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, unveiled the formation of a new blockchain and cryptocurrency advocacy group earlier this week.

42379838,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Kti7,1504285535,Monopoly-Resistant Mining? Paper Claims Bitcoin Centralization Fears Overblown,"Bitcoin might be naturally resistant to mining monopolies – or so claims a new research paper authored by University of Siena professor of economics, Nicola Dimitri.  At a high level, the paper contends ""the intrinsic structure of the mining activity seems to prevent the formation of a monopoly,"" a finding that could ease some of the concerns in an industry currently grappling with whether miners have too much power.  Published in Ledger, a journal that covers blockchain research exclusively, the paper explains in depth how, in an equilibrium, miners don't necessarily leave the system just because other miners are able to profit more by cutting their costs somehow.  According to Peter Rizun, co-founder and co-managing editor of Ledger, the conclusion is quite ""important"" for the cryptocurrency community.  In an email, Rizun, who is also the chief scientist for the alternative bitcoin implementation, Bitcoin Unlimited, told CoinDesk:  ""The mindset of much of the community today is that 'it's critical that all miners have essentially the same profitability hash-per-hash, otherwise the most profitable miner will continue to grow until he controls nearly all the hash power.'""  The possibility of mining power centralizing has been particularly worrisome to developers.  For one, at least one mining pool is alleged to have used a more efficient way of mining – known as ASICBoost – to increase profits, which some think could force other miners to leave, said Rizun. And two, many believe slower block propagation benefits larger miners, again pushing out smaller firms, he continued.  But, he contends the paper adds more game-theoretical color as to what incentivizes miners and establishes that these things don't necessarily negatively affect users.  How much control?  It's not only developers that are concerned, though.  The cryptocurrency community at large often worries about how much control miners have, or could theoretically have in certain conditions, displaying a kind of distrust that's built up between groups, and that was especially apparent in recent bitcoin scaling debates.  Some users worry miners have too much influence over technical decision-making, for example.  And that was highlighted by one of Rizun's Medium posts in March, which many readers interpreted as arguing that miners could force users to move from bitcoin to Bitcoin Unlimited.  As to be expected the post sparked controversy, getting comments like bitcoin contributor Meni Rosenfield's: ""This is a disgrace and stands against everything bitcoin represents.""  Too early to tell  Being a particularly controversial character, it's possible developers will find fault with Rizun's interpretation of the study. Even its author, Dimitri notes it might be too early to make broad assumptions.  ""In its simplicity the model is omitting a number of elements, which could be investigated in future research,"" he states in the paper.  And Dimitri goes on to admit that other variables, particularly those that have been contentious in bitcoin's debates to date, could change the calculations.  He concludes the paper:  ""Among them the current debate and interest on the block size, which may affect the main conclusions of the paper, at least in so far as the number of potentially active miners is concerned.""

42379831,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Ktbp,1504278909,Central Bank-Backed Group Plans Blockchain Platform Launch in India,"A research group founded by India’s central bank has reportedly announced plans to launch a new blockchain platform.  Though the specifics of the launch aren’t clear, the Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology (IDRBT), founded in the 1990s by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), is looking to create a range of banking-related services on top of the tech. According to a report from The Hindu Business Line, the project was disclosed on Friday during a technology awards event by IDRBT director A. S. Ramasastri.  ""We will be launching this platform very soon,"" he told attendees.  At the urging of the central bank, the research outfit has been exploring applications in the areas of banking since last year.  In a report published in January, IDRBT staffers suggested that India could use blockchain as the basis for a digitization of the rupee, the country’s national currency. That call came as India’s government pushed ahead with a plan to demonetize larger denominations of the rupee, a move that continues to be highly controversial to this day, according to recent reports.  As previously reported, regulators in India have been studying the tech since 2014, and work continues on possible new rules for cryptocurrency activities in the country.

42379834,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Ktfb,1504272657,China's Internet Finance Association Issues ICO Warning,"A self-regulatory organization focused on online finance in China has issued a warning to its members on initial coin offerings (ICOs).  In a statement yesterday, the National Internet Finance Association of China warned that ICOs may be using misleading information as part of fundraising campaigns, urging investors to proceed with extreme caution. The group, which works with government agencies on regulatory matters, further stated its intention to toughen security measures.  The remarks further advised member companies to remain cautious when dealing with the nascent fundraising mechanism, stating:  ""China Internet Finance Association members should take the initiative to strengthen self-discipline, to resist illegal financial behavior.""  The announcement by the group, established by the People’s Bank of China in 2016, may not be surprising given that ICOs have been subject to strict scrutiny by the regulator.  Already, the central bank is said to be drafting regulations which may seek to suspend all ICO activity. A draft of regulatory measures for ICOs was published last week that suggested they could be classified as illegal.  It seems some domestic ICO efforts are taking note. ICO website ICOINFO went so far as to announce a temporary suspension yesterday due to the uncertainty over regulations.  The group features more than 400 financial organizations, with notable members including online lender CreditEase and financial marketplace provider Lufax.

42379845,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Ktqv,1504263625,Inevitable Bust? GPU Makers See Crypto Mining as Short-Term Sales Boost,"Graphics card manufacturers are riding high on renewed interest in cryptocurrencies.  While historically the slowest time of the year for these businesses, Q2 proved to be lucrative for Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) as interest in ethereum and other cryptocurrencies has exhausted graphics processing unit (GPU) inventories.  That's because, while not designed for the technology, GPUs from product lines such as Nvidia's GeForce and AMD's Radeon can be used to mine ethereum and other popular public blockchains, including litecoin, NEM, dash, monero and NEO. This means that by running special software, these hardware components allow users to compete for lucrative rewards. (On the ethereum blockchain, each block is now worth nearly $2,000).  And as the value of these digital assets has surged in the second and third quarters, GPU companies have seen booming demand. Nvidia posted a record $2.23 billion in revenues for the quarter ending June 30 – a 56 percent increase over the prior-year quarter and $280 million above the company's forecast.  Further, AMD, whose new graphics card sold out within minutes, grew revenues 19 percent to $1.22 billion, catalyzed by a 51 percent surge in sales from its computing and graphics division.  Industry-wide, shipments of add-in boards – which house the external graphics cards used by cryptocurrency miners – were up 31 percent from the first quarter to the second, according to Jon Peddie Research, a market research firm which tracks GPU sales.  By contrast, over the last decade, first to second quarter shipments declined by an average of 10 percent, and plummeted by 22 percent in 2016.  To further illustrate the explosive demand for crypto mining, Jon Peddie, president of the research firm, emphasized the sales were almost entirely driven by high-end GPUs – which typically sell for between $500 and $1,000 – which are the most powerful and preferred by miners.  Peddie explained:  ""At normal distribution, the high end is 10 percent [of units]; now it's more like 90 percent. If you took the high-end sales out of the equation, you would have seen a second quarter drop that would be normal seasonality.""  Reasons for optimism  A hallmark trait of any asset bubble is the proclamation that ""this time is different,"" even though the end result is usually the same: a price collapse.  Yet, there is ample reason to believe that this mining boom might actually be different, as the surge in demand in 2017 is much stronger and more diversified than what was observed in 2013.  Ambrish Srivastava, an equities analyst who covers both companies for BMO Capital Markets, a division of the Bank of Montreal, went so far as to make this assertion in a recent note to clients, writing:  ""There is merit to that argument. There are many more currencies; there is a lot more momentum behind [mining].""  Not only is the popularity of ethereum and tokens issued on its blockchain continuing to grow, there are no alternatives that could render GPUs unnecessary on the network, which now holds $36 billion in value.  In short, investments in GPUs for mining could have staying power. While bitcoin eventually saw GPU mining replaced by more powerful ASIC designs, ethereum's mining algorithm is built to resist this outcome.  ""That algorithm is written in such a way that it will only run on a GPU. Alternative silicon solutions aren't forthcoming,"" said Peddie. ""As long as people can make money doing ethereum mining, they will continue to invest in GPUs.""  Manufacturer's take  Yet, a key question for both of these companies, and more broadly the industry, is how long the crypto-boom, and the mining demand it fuels, will continue.  During Nvidia's second quarter earnings call, company CEO Jensen Huang was optimistic that the roughly $150 million in revenue made during the quarter from GPU sales for crypto mining would continue, asserting cryptocurrencies and blockchain are ""here to stay.""  He continued:  ""This is a market that is not likely to go away anytime soon, and the only thing that we can probably expect is that there will be more currencies to come. It will come in a whole lot of different nations. It will emerge from time to time, and the GPU is really quite great for it.""  While these comments are quite bullish, Colette Kress, Nvidia's chief financial officer, attempted to walk them back in a follow up call with analysts, according to Kevin Cassidy, an equities analyst with Stifel Nicolaus.  ""When I asked the CFO for more details on that, she said, 'Well, I think he overplayed that.' She's a little more cautious on the market,"" Cassidy told CoinDesk.  And this carefulness echoes AMD CEO Lisa Su, who took a more tempered approach in her company's second quarter earnings call.  ""It's important to say we didn't have cryptocurrency in our forecast, and we're not looking at it as a long-term growth driver,"" she said, adding:  ""We want to be cognizant of the fact that some of the graphics demand that we see might be temporal. So we're not counting on that staying through the full year. Frankly, I think we'll see what happens with the whole mining stuff.""  Unlike Nvidia, AMD did not estimate how much revenue it derived from mining activity, but Mitch Steves, an equities analyst with RBC Capital Markets, surmises the figure is between $220 million and $250 million.  Because AMD is much smaller than Nvidia, but recognized as the market share leader for crypto mining products, the company has little to gain by promoting the extent to which it benefits from the activity, since Steves estimates it would be material to their top line.  ""So that’s why they try to message it differently,"" Steves continued. ""If AMD comes off as really aggressive and, let's say, 10 percent of their top line is going to cryptocurrencies, investors are going to be wary to pay for that revenue because it could go away very quickly.""  Possible headwinds  And there are looming headwinds that will likely put pressure on mining demand and, by extension, GPU sales. For instance, upcoming changes to ethereum’s infrastructure are likely to eliminate altogether the need for mining in its ecosystem.  ""While we have seen a surge in demand from cryptocurrency mining in the second quarter for GPU cards, we are not at all bullish on the sustainability of this demand,"" Srivastava wrote.  Several other analysts doubled down on that skepticism, wondering if a sharp slowdown might prompt a repeat of the crypto-bust of 2013 and 2014, when a decline in bitcoin prices prompted miners to jump ship and begin selling off their GPUs – primarily AMD devices – on the secondary market.  Srivastava told CoinDesk:  ""I talked to miners who said 'The moment the price collapsed and the economics went against mining, I just immediately sold all of my stuff on eBay at whatever price I could get.'""  The fallout from the bust subsequently throttled AMD's sales for several ensuing quarters.  ""That caused AMD to have inventory problems,"" explained Cassidy. ""No one was buying new cards because you could buy used cards for half the price.""  And that's a scenario many people are cautious of.

US Government Grants $100k for New Blockchain Research,"The U.S. government has awarded a $100,000 grant to a group of researchers looking to apply blockchain to public library systems.  The Institute of Museum and Library Services was founded in the mid-'90s, with the aim of providing federal support to libraries and museums. Public records show that officials with the agency are funding a new effort at the San Jose State University Research Foundation, which seeks to conduct preliminary research into how blockchain tech could help libraries manage digital rights, as well better assist their communities.  The work being conducted isn't exactly technical, however – rather, the funding will go to the planning of a forum event – buoyed by survey data and additional efforts – that would culminate with a topic on the applicability of blockchain to the library system.  As the grant document states:  ""The proposed National Forum would bring together 20-30 technical experts in libraries, blockchain technology, and urban planning to discuss ways that blockchain technology can advance library services to support city or community goals. The resulting commentary from a project blog, national forum, and conference and the survey data will be evaluated and included in the project's final report, which will be available online.""  Still, it's the latest instance in which an element of the U.S. government has moved to fund research into the tech and its possible applications.
