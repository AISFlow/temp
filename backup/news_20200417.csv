42404524,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiZ7Q,1587158513,Market Wrap: Crypto Mining Stock Hut 8 Jumps on Unusually High Trading Volume,"Shares of cryptocurrency mining firm Hut 8 Mining Corp. (TSX:HUT) surged 32 percent with unusually high trading volume on the Toronto Stock Exchange Friday.       The huge, surprising bounce for the stock arrives after the firm warned earlier in April that coronavirus-related issues might hurt its business.      Like cryptocurrencies themselves, mining company stocks are prone to violent swings, noted Moe Adham, CEO of Canada-based crypto BTM operator Bitaccess.      “These stocks are thinly traded. Happens all the time,” said Adham, who also sits on the board of publicly traded Cypherpunk Holdings (Canadian Stock Exchange: HODL).      Read more: In Canada They’re ‘Essential,’ In Argentina They’re Shut Down: Bitcoin Miners Reckon With COVID-19      However, volumes for Hut 8’s stock are over 1.5 million in shares traded Friday, nearly eight times the daily average.      The stock’s price did dip some in afternoon trading Eastern time, but the jump is still striking.      The advantage Hut 8 enjoys in Canada, where cryptocurrency mining is deemed “essential” during the coronavirus pandemic and thus exempt from a government lockdown, gives it an edge over competitors in other countries.      As the bitcoin halving looms, traders will be watching publicly traded crypto mining companies to better understand the profitability of generating BTC for cash flow.    Oil price decline no help to crypto miners    The drop in oil prices this year has been a huge topic for traders across all markets, including crypto.      On Jan. 2, the first day of trading for the year, oil changed hands for as high as $64 a barrel.      On Friday, the commodity traded in a narrow $18 range.      Oil prices are often seen as a bellwether for energy costs. However, it is a poor proxy for these costs when discussing bitcoin mining, which mostly utilizes green energy sources, said Simon Peters, a crypto analyst at multi-asset brokerage eToro.      “The most recent report from CoinShares suggests 73 percent of the energy used for bitcoin mining comes from renewables rather than fossil fuels such as oil,” Peters said.      In addition, Hut 8 uses natural gas, notes CoinDesk Research’s Matt Yamamoto, who is working on a report about the company.      Read more: Bitcoin Mining Hardware War Is Heating Up Ahead of the Halving      Hence, any reduction in energy prices due to oil’s decline will likely not help the crypto mining industry, Peters said. ""If we did see all energy providers reduce their kilowatt hour rates, including renewables, then possibly less-efficient mining operations may still be able to hold their heads above water, post-block reward halving.”    Crypto markets    Bitcoin prices have climbed by less than 1 percent over the last 24 hours, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index as of 20:50 UTC (4:50 p.m. EDT) Friday.      Bitcoin is above the 50-day moving average on spot exchanges such as Coinbase but trading action has been fairly flat, with little up or down movement. For most of the day, bitcoin has ambled in a $7,000-7,200 range.      Digital assets are mixed on CoinDesk’s big board for the day. Ether (ETH) slipped less than a percent. Gainers include dogecoin (DOGE) gaining 2 percent, cardano (ADA) up 1.3 percent, and bitcoin gold (BTG) in the green 1.2 percent. One notable loser today is lisk (LSK), in the red 1 percent.      A sharp increase in stablecoin issuance is giving traders an easy place to park value on flat bitcoin days like Friday, according to Mitesh Shah, an analyst and founder of Omnia Markets, which studies the crypto market.      “As we have seen with the current economic climate created by the pandemic, many crypto investors liquidated BTC, ETH, LTC and XRP holdings and invested in stablecoins as a storage of value,” Shah said. Sitting in price-stable crypto may even set the stage for a bitcoin binge in the future when traders decide to not sit on the sidelines.      Indeed, in this uncertain environment access to the U.S. dollar (which many think of as the world’s reserve currency) in the form of a blockchain-based asset is highly attractive to global traders.      “Fiat currencies [other than the dollar] are getting impacted by the latest economic turmoil, which results in the fluctuation in exchange rates, reducing the purchasing power and inflation in the market,”said Constantin Kogan, partner at crypto fund BitBull Capital.      “Hypothetically, these issues can be overcome by the use of stablecoins,” he said.    Other markets    Gold, the supposed stable safe haven asset in tumultuous times crypto fanatics also love to follow, is slipping 2 percent and trending downward below 10-day and 50-day moving averages.      In Asia, the Nikkei 225 climbed 3.1 percent on the day, a six-week high. The Tokyo-based stock index was tracking highs on U.S. equities futures amid optimism for a coronavirus vaccine.      Europe’s FTSE 100 index end its day up 2.4 percent as excitement over possibilities for pandemic drug remdesivir spilled over to the London trading day.      In the United States, trading of the S&P 500 index climbed 2.7 percent. U.S. Treasury bonds were mixed as the Federal Reserve slowed bond buying after the past two days saw all yields in the red. For Friday, 30-year and 10-year remain relatively flat while the 2-year price dropped 8.4 percent.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/17/market-wrap-crypto-mining-stock-hut-8-jumps-on-unusually-high-trading-volume,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3de5c4992ead8d3373cf54c0b06787c6edf52d9a-3000x1649.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Hotels in Pennsylvania and Costa Rica will be the first to be tokenized in the deal.      Read more: Pennsylvania's State-Backed VC Firm Is Tokenizing an Investment Fund      The multi-firm partnership lays the groundwork for a steady stream of real estate tokenization projects for properties and real estate investment trusts in Philadelphia and other parts of the northeastern U.S., said Vertalo CEO Dave Hendricks.      The digital representations of real-estate shares will trade alongside tZERO’s private equity token, TZROP, and Overstock’s digital voting series A-1 preferred stock, said tZERO CEO Saum Noursalehi.      “Rather than doing one-off deals … we’re partnering and are able to scale that way,” Noursalehi said. “We’re the most liquid platform out there for security tokens. We should have our own retail broker-dealer live in Q2 and have signed up another four to five broker-dealers to integrate and trade security tokens on our platform.”      There are already 55 additional funds in the pipeline, waiting to begin tokenized, Vertalo’s Hendricks said. Vertalo is working with four other firms similar to Advantage that will provide access to more funds.    On Tezos    Through Vertalo, Advantage will use the Tezos blockchain to tokenize the real estate. On tZERO, investors can sign up to trade tokens through Dinosaur Financial Group, a broker-dealer that is consumer-facing. The tokens will be custodied by Nevada-based Prime Trust.      In the past, tokenizing real estate has been viewed as a way to make it easier to trade real estate investments. Trading real estate normally requires finding a buyer and transferring paper certificates to a central office.      “If you own a building and your plan is to own it for five years and improve the value, the cost to buy and sell is expensive,” said Gary Brandeis, president of Real Estate Capital Management. “The amount of value you have to create is significant. … You have to make it up to get in and out of real estate.”      The properties in this portfolio will now be open to all accredited investors instead of just those within traditional real estate owner networks, said Marc Paquin, Advantage’s co-founder and chief operating officer.      While past efforts to tokenize real estate have failed because of low investor interest, Vertalo is aiming to help managers who are looking to improve back-office efficiency and create more liquidity, Hendricks said.      Read more: Tokenized Real Estate Falters as Another Hyped Deal Falls Apart      Vertalo has agreements with firms tokenizing real estate across the globe, but Advantage is the first firm to specialize in real estate tokenization that is choosing to bring all of its deals through Vertalo.    ‘Time is now’    “Before now, and our integrations with [alternative trading systems] like tZERO and custodians like Prime Trust, it was not really possible to create and facilitate compliant secondary markets,” Hendricks said. “That time is now.”      Hendricks says he developed the Vertalo Real Estate Platform as a tool for real estate holders, investors and fund managers to tokenize current investments, as opposed to tokenizing real estate and finding new investors for those security tokens.      “When you do an STO [security token offering] in the U.S. using a Reg D, you have to wait a year before those are tradable,” Hendricks said, referring to the Security and Exchange Commission’s Regulation D, which covers private placement exemptions. “Because the deal is tokenizing real estate with existing investors, these shares will be able to be listed immediately and traded immediately.”      This first licensee represents a shift in the transfer agent’s tokenization model. While it plans to continue using security tokens to fundraise for real estate, it is now aiming to build a more stable secondary market.      “The stuff we’re doing now is with fund managers who already own the assets,” Hendricks said. “We’re not using a security token to raise money. We’re using the technology to reduce costs and save money.”      UPDATE (April 17, 21:42 UTC): An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that tokenized shares would be open to non-accredited investors. They will only be open to accredited investors.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | XTZ | TOKEN SALE,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/04/17/vertalo-tzero-are-bringing-300m-in-real-estate-to-the-tezos-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/071e946e7e837f3b8a0f571d6d4b056c8ca66674-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404498,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiUKI,1587146874,Bitcoin Halving Searches on Google Hits All-Time Highs,"Searches for “bitcoin halving” on Google Trends recently reached record highs, suggesting peak interest in the retail crowd about the upcoming supply altering event.      Queries about the highly anticipated event peaked in the week ending April 11, the highest in bitcoin’s (BTC) 11-year history. It moved down 18 percent as of press time but remains at elevated levels. It remains double what it was for the week ending March 21.      Google Trends scale their searches on a range of 0 to 100 “based on a topic’s to all searches on a topic,” according to the company.      The sharp rise is indicative of an “increase in retail interest,” according to Mike Alfred, CEO of fintech and data company Digital Assets Data.      Bitcoin goes through a process called halving every four years. The inbuilt mechanism reduces the reward per block mined on bitcoin’s blockchain by 50 percent. Essentially, reward halving cuts the pace of supply expansion by 50 percent every four years.      See also: Bitcoin Halving, Explained      The cryptocurrency is set to undergo its third-ever reward halving next month, following which the per block reward would drop to 6.25 BTC from the current 12.5 BTC.      The popular narrative is that halving is a price-bullish event. Bitcoin’s price has witnessed a solid rally over the past few weeks. The top cryptocurrency is currently changing hands near $7,050, representing over 80 percent gains on the low of $3,867 registered on March 13.      As such, one may associate the recent price rally with the uptick in the search interest for bitcoin halving. However, it is doubtful anybody would be able to establish just how much of that rise in interest has translated into actual purchases of bitcoins.      It's quite possible that the retail community is merely searching for information about halving and its impact on price, but is sitting on the fence. Even the analyst community is divided on the prospects of a post-halving price rally.      Some observers expect the 50 percent reward cut to bode well for bitcoin’s price. “Halving should create increased upward pressure on the price of bitcoin in the coming two months,” Matthew Dibb, co-founder and COO of Stack, told CoinDesk at the beginning of April. Further, stock-to-flow models predict that halving will send bitcoin’s price to $100,000.      However, crypto asset analytics company Coin Metrics, in its recent “State of the Network” report concluded that miner-led selling pressure around bitcoin is likely to increase in the coming months.        Queries for the phrase “buy bitcoin” have not seen a similar spike.      The search term “buy bitcoin” is nearly a third down from when bitcoin suffered its “Black Thursday” crash on March 12.      Thus increasing retail interest in the upcoming halving may not translate into additional buying pressure around the cryptocurrency.      Yet, some observers cite the recent rise in the number of bitcoin addresses holding at least 1 BTC and at least 0.1 BTC as evidence of accumulation by retail investors ahead of halving.      The number of unique addresses holding at least one bitcoin rose to a record high of 805,805 on April 16 after dropping from 795,140 to 789,399 in the seven days to March 16, according to data provided by Blockchain intelligence firm Glassnode. During that time period, bitcoin’s price fell from $9,000 to $4,000.      The number of unique addresses holding at least 0.1 BTC also rose to a record high of 2,984,777. The number began rising sharply in February and maintained its ascent even during the March price crash.      “We are hearing and seeing increased retail interest. The unprecedented era of stimulus and money printing has pushed many people toward bitcoin as an alternative monetary system,” said Mike Alfred, CEO of Digital Assets Data.      The Federal Reserve cut interest rates to zero and launched an open-ended asset purchase program to counter the coronavirus-led economic slowdown. The balance sheets of G4 central banks – the Fed, Bank of Japan, European Central Banks and the Bank of England - have expanded to 40 percent of their respective nation’s combined gross domestic product, as noted by popular analyst Jeroen Blokland.      See also: Bitcoin Mining Hardware War Is Heating Up Ahead of the Halving      While the rise in the number of unique addresses does suggest accumulation, it should be noted that a single user can hold 50,000 coins in 50,000 different addresses. Therefore, these metrics do not necessarily represent retail accumulations.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MINING | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/17/bitcoin-halving-searches-on-google-hits-all-time-highs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/143216402b0fcec81b05854885180b3e208e300c-1500x849.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404501,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiUMG,1587146250,Money Reimagined: Demand for USD Stablecoins Foreshadows Financial Disruption,"Picture a consulting firm with 150 staff worldwide, a global retail chain with a million in-store employees, or a manufacturer that sources high-turnover inventory from more than 50 suppliers in 10 different countries – each an archetype of the global, corporate economy.      What’s the one thing they all need consistent access to? Cash.      That basic need lies at the heart of a global, and potentially transformative, scramble for liquidity as the economic outlook turns dire during the COVID-19 pandemic. Firms want an unbroken, liquid source of funds to make payroll and settle invoices – without which the entire economy goes into toxic shock – and specifically, they want dollars.      The pandemic has unleashed a global race for greenbacks, which when combined with a debt crisis for the world’s banks could catalyze a sea change in our global payments system with what some are starting to call “crypto dollarization.”      You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.      Crypto or not, dollars are the only game in town now. It’s the currency in which debt and assets are denominated worldwide and, because it’s used for cross-border payments, it’s the easiest to get, the most liquid.      The U.S. Federal Reserve is currently facilitating this by opening currency swap lines with other countries’ central banks and providing them with short-term “repo” lending. As I alluded to in last week’s inaugural edition of this newsletter, the Fed will eventually be unable and/or unwilling to be the world’s indefinite lender of last resort, with huge geopolitical ramifications when it withdraws support. But for now, the dollar is king.      Dollarization is combining with a looming debt crisis. This week, Goldman Sachs forecast a staggering 34 percent contraction in first quarter U.S. GDP and the International Monetary Fund said 2020 will be the worst year for the world economy since the Great Depression. The defaults and bankruptcies this will generate are almost unfathomable.      Of course, the world’s governments will try to backstop banks and companies, which is one reason the IMF is forecasting that, globally, net public debt will rise to 85 percent in 2020 from 70 percent last year. Since this entails robbing Peter (taxpayers) to pay Paul (corporate shareholders and bankers), the political tensions unleashed by bailout negotiations will sow acrimony and fear and could undermine confidence in the system.      The banking system is nothing without confidence. It’s built on a fractional reserve model by which banks lend out deposits, which creates new money without the equivalent held in reserve. (Cast your mind to the ""It’s a Wonderful Life"" speech by the Jimmy Stewart character George Bailey to his savings and loan customers for a reminder of how a loss of confidence can seriously challenge this model.)      When the edifice of confidence looks shaky, a business leader with cash liquidity needs faces a dilemma. Many will hold their noses and continue to bet on the existing system. But anyone who’s lived through, say, Greece’s debt crisis, or Argentina’s currency meltdowns, or any other emerging-market panic might look at the world’s debt numbers with trepidation. Given the post-COVID outlook for banks’ loan customers, some will doubt the security of their deposits, regardless of whether they are denominated in dollars.      What’s a business to do then? They can’t withdraw and hoard cash to protect themselves; banknotes are hardly a viable payments option in the modern world. But perhaps dollar-backed stablecoins pose an option. These carry the bearer instrument qualities of cash, where the right to value is transferred peer-to-peer without an intermediary, based purely on the change in possession. But they also have the capacity to move money globally and securely, all, in theory, without the security risks of the banking system. Since the token issuer commits to hold the full equivalent in reserves for all tokens issued, the fractional reserve system’s perennial question about deposit assurance ceases to be an issue.      Perhaps this is why data since March 1 from CoinMarketCap.com show a striking 40 percent increase in market capitalization of the four largest reserve-backed stablecoins – Tether’s USDT (on Ethereum, Tron and Omni), Centre’s USDC, Binance’s BUSD, and Paxos’s PAX.      First, let’s put this in perspective. Totaling more than $8 billion, the combined number is still just a fraction of bitcoin’s $128.7 billion and is minuscule compared with, say, the $28.5 trillion market cap of all stocks on the New York Stock Exchange. Moreover, the growth in stablecoins could simply reflect a natural crisis-fueled move into stability by exchanges, miners and other big cryptocurrency market players, traditionally the main users of stablecoins.      But other evidence points to something more meaningful. Firstly, the total value traded over the ethereum blockchain, which supports stablecoins such as tether and USDC, has reached parity with bitcoin, according to a chart from Messari based on Coinmetrics data. This number, which aggregates the value of ethereum’s native currency, ether, and that of all ERC-20 tokens built on ethereum, suggests people are increasingly transacting in stablecoins.      Also, there’s this telling comment from Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle, which along with Coinbase is one of the two members of the CENTRE consortium that issues and manages USDC tokens. Speaking of demand for a new USDC payments service his company launched for businesses last month, Allaire told our Nikhilesh De:    Examples of new businesses opening accounts span e-commerce marketplaces, advertising networks, luxury goods makers, recruiting platforms, digital content markets, P2P lending and payments companies, software companies, professional services firms, loyalty and rewards businesses, mobile banking providers and other internet services. We believe we are seeing a real turning point in the adoption of digital currency.    If non-crypto businesses are starting to see a mainstream use for stablecoins, libra’s new move away from a basket-of-currencies model into one-on-one stablecoins could prove well timed. The shift, announced Thursday, seems at least partly intended to mollify regulators’ concerns about the Facebook-founded Libra Association’s capacity to distort national monetary policies. But it could also be a fortuitous time to create a dollar stablecoin.      Libra’s announcement means CENTRE (which issues USDC), Tether, Binance and Paxos could be getting a big new global competitor. Will it stop there? What’s to stop other big players joining the stablecoin business? Mastercard? Visa? (Both are former members of the Libra Association.)      The big question is what this all means for banks themselves and whether they too will join this stablecoin movement?      For some time, advocates for protecting the plumbing of payments from the financial system’s periodic crises, and their accompanying “too-big-to-fail” bailouts, have argued for a “narrow banking” model. You deposit money with your bank, which it invests in super safe securities such as Treasury bills, and the only service it provides is to enable you to make electronic payments with your funds. Under this model, your money is not re-lent into the economy; providing credit is the domain of fund managers and professional investors, not for bankers who simultaneously manage our payments system.      Narrow banking hasn’t taken off for the simple reason that it’s not nearly as profitable as politically backstopped fractional reserve banking. But ultimately, it’s society, not the banks, that should define the system. Maybe now we’ll understand the value of narrow banking – which, in the age of cryptocurrency might essentially means bank-issued stablecoins.      A bigger question is whether fractional reserve banking ultimately survives and, if it doesn’t, what’s the best way to generate the credit our economy needs? Also, how do central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) fit into all this?      These are heady issues, better reserved for a later edition of Money Reimagined.      And, to be clear, it’s early days. Maybe all this will blow over. Also, vested political interests have much to gain from protecting the existing system.      But the COVID-19 crisis is unprecedented. Not even the titans of banking are immune from the pressures it will bring to bear on incumbent institutions.    It's still a debt crisis    Nic Carter of Castle Island Ventures argued in a tweet last week that “in the next year or so,” we’ll realize the world economy’s crisis isn’t a health crisis but a debt crisis. He’s right. The economic pain from COVID-19 lockdowns would more easily pass if a massive debt overhang weren’t in place. We’d see a temporary supply shock of the kind that accompanies a disaster like a hurricane, where economic activity shrinks but then swiftly rebounds to prior levels as reconstruction begins.      But in this case the pandemic is just the trigger, pushing already unsustainable debt-to-asset levels to a point where central banks can no longer simply reflate away the problem. This IMF map of private debt to GDP shows why this matters: The largest economies, those simultaneously taking the worst COVID-19 hit and upon whose stimulus efforts global recovery depends, are saddled with the biggest burden. It’s why banks are in trouble. It’s why I don’t think the old financial system survives this crisis.    The global town hall    A Bank of England webinar about central bank digital currencies would struggle to compete with Netflix’s and HBO’s offerings in social distancing households. But within my nerdy Twitter feed, last week’s BOE presentation generated much buzz. At the outset, fintech director Tom Mutton provided the caveat that the 326-year-old bank has no commitment to launch a CBDC. Still, with COVID-19 effects expected to accelerate CBDC adoption, it was nonetheless worthwhile to garner ideas from an institution that, in 2015, was one of the first to explore the technology. As you can see from the YouTube rerun, it was also peppered with insights from viewers via a series of flash surveys. This one stood out: If CBDCs were to employ distributed ledger technology (read: permissioned blockchains), the power of “programmability” topped the poll as its biggest benefit. “Programmable money” is entering the lexicon, folks.      The digital dollar is baaaaack. Well, at least inside the Washington bubble.After an on again, off again appearance in House and Senate stimulus bills last month, the idea of “FedAccounts,” or “Digital Dollar Account Wallets” reappeared in a radical bill from Congresswomen Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.). As proposed, digital dollar wallets would be the tool by which the federal government distributes a monthly $2,000 to each resident from the proceeds of a pair of freshly minted $1 trillion coins issued to the Fed. Setting aside the incongruence that hard-money bitcoiners see between monetary alchemy and digital currency technology, what’s bothersome, even for those who believe governments should employ this technology, is that ideas are being rushed without heed to the technical challenges. Former Commodities and Futures Trading Commission Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo, a proponent of digital dollars, couldn’t have been more direct or timely than in his CoinDesk OpEd Thursday, entitled “Digital Dollar Project: Don’t Rush Digital Dollar During COVID-19 Crisis.”      China’s Blockchain Service Network is a game changer. Beijing is determined to use blockchain technology – to be clear, permissioned, not permissionless, blockchains – as the platform for a new, digitally connected economy. Now, details have emerged of a new developer framework for municipal governments and Chinese businesses to employ. CoinDesk’s Wolfie Zhao and David Pan laid out details on the BSN in a richly informative deep dive Tuesday. Open, permissionless, freedom-protecting technology, this is not. But it would be a grave mistake to assume China won’t reap the competitive benefits of a BSN-based programmable economy.      Money is losing its meaning. So says Jared Dillian of Bloomberg in a column that touches on a rather straightforward but insightful point. Whatever one thinks about central bankers’ power over fiat monetary policy in the post-Nixon Shock era, the public’s faith in money has hinged on an understanding that policymakers are subordinate to the core principle that a currency must be scarce. That is, it’s constrained by something, even if only an institutional obligation to protect its value. Now, with the Fed pledging trillion-dollar sums worth of asset buying for an indefinite period, Dillian says, “These numbers are so large that they no longer have any meaning; they are simply abstractions.” Me? I wouldn’t say money itself is losing its meaning. What’s at risk is thisparticular half-century-oldWestern conception of money. Inevitably, society will imagine a new money, one that does have meaning. Let the reimagining begin!",NEUTRAL,USDC,BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | USDC,Michael J.

42404502,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiUNF,1587142212,"Blockchain Bites: Binance vs. Ethereum, MicroBT vs. Bitmain, Libra vs. the World","Today, Binance unveiled plans for a smart contract blockchain competing with Ethereum, Bitcoin miner manufacturer MicroBT looks to beat Bitmain to market, and the road ahead for stablecoins looks bumpy.      ""The industry needs more high-performance infrastructures, not just one single blockchain,"" a Binance spokesperson said, adding the two networks would complement one another in growing the blockchain ecosystem. Here's the story:    You're reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they're significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk's newsletters here.  Top Shelf    Binance's Base Layer Binance released a white paper detailing a new smart contract blockchain that might compete with Ethereum. The new Binance Smart Chain (BSC) would work as a smart contract layer running parallel to its existing Binance Chain, and incorporate a matching engine capable of fast trade executions and a new consensus mechanism designed to combine fast confirmation times with strong on-chain governance.      Mining Wars Shenzhen-based MicroBT is rolling out three new energy-efficient bitcoin miners amid heated competition with industry giant Bitmain ahead of the network's halving event in less than 30 days. MicroBT has slowly chipped away at Bitmain’s market dominance, and now looks to push out its latest models ahead of the halving and Bitmain’s updated machines expected in May.    Stablecoins  Circle:  Four months after Circle pivoted to stablecoins, the startup’s new business model has received an unexpected boost from the global coronavirus crisis. “Over the past several weeks, we have seen explosive interest and growth in USDC,” co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire said, referring to the stablecoin Circle issues in partnership with Coinbase. “There is clearly very significant global demand for digital dollars, and the use of digital dollars as a new payment medium.”  According to CoinMetrics, over the past six weeks, the Paxos Standard (PAX) grew 22 percent, from $198 million to $258 million; tether (USDT) grew 36 percent from $4.6 billion to $6.3 billion and the Gemini dollar (GUSD) grew from $3.9 million to $6.2 million, or up 6 percent. The Binance dollar (BUSD) issued with Paxos saw the fastest growth, from $68 million to nearly $200 million, or up a whopping 194 percent.    Libra  Despite scaling back the vision of the Libra project to essentially be a PayPal clone, at least one U.S. lawmaker is still turned off by Facebook’s tarnished brand. ""There are simply too many questions left unanswered regarding why Facebook is even developing a cryptocurrency and how it will affect the global economy and consumers,"" Rep. Sylvia Garcia, a member of the House Financial Services Committee, said Thursday.  Digital Dollars  Congresswomen Rashida Tlaib and Pramila Jayapal introduced a proposal to have the federal government issue $2,000 per month issued to residents in digital dollar account wallets. The stimulus would be financed by minting a pair of $1 trillion coins and using these to back the payments. “No later than January 1, 2021, the Secretary shall offer all recipients of BOOST payments the option to receive their payments in digital dollar wallets,” Thursday’s bill read.  J. Christopher Giancarlo, former chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, thinks the ongoing discussion around a digital dollar project during the COVID-19 crisis is premature. “Something as complex and worthy of the U.S. dollar’s global importance should not be cobbled together in a crisis. Getting it right will take time. Nevertheless, now is the right time to get started,” he writes in a CoinDesk op-ed.    Purse Closed Bitcoin startup Purse will shut down after six years in the space, according to an email sent to customers Thursday. Purse will continue to facilitate services until June 26 but signups will cease Thursday. Additionally, the startup’s “Shop and Earn” functionality will be disabled next week on April 23 and open orders that have not been matched will be canceled, the email states.      Privacy Protocol BTCPay, a popular open source tool for accepting bitcoin payments, is incorporating PayJoin to preserve the privacy of those transactions. PayJoin has been around since 2018, and may offer greater privacy than existing solutions like CoinJoin, but few services have added support for it yet.      Security Concerns    Russian citizens are trolling a government-released mobile contact tracing app that is designed to help stop COVID-19 contagion. Smartphone users in Russia are giving it low ratings and leaving bad reviews in the Android and iOS app stores. Some are reporting the government-backed app to Google and Apple in the hopes of getting it removed, an action usually taken for copyright infringement or inappropriate content.  The Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (PEPP-PT) consortium developing privacy protocols for a contact tracing app has quietly removed mention of a decentralized standard from its website. It’s unclear what a PEPP-PT protocol might look like, but a centralized approach would have more privacy risks, as well as the potential for the re-appropriation of data for other purposes, like state surveillance.  Spanish researchers are developing a smartphone app that leverages blockchain technology and artificial intelligence to help stem the coronavirus pandemic, and preserve the privacy of “digital identities.”    Charged With Fraud The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has charged a self-claimed Florida financial adviser and his company with fraud for allegedly duping investors in his algorithmically charged “Compcoin” token out of $1.6 million.      Libel Updates Decrypt’s Tim Copeland gives the current state of Craig Wright’s five libel suits, which the nChain scientist filed last year.      Tightening Controls    As banks in emerging economies are imposing tighter currency controls amid the coronavirus-led financial downturn, Nassim Nicholas Taleb, author of ""The Black Swan” and “Fooled By Randomness,” is urging citizens turn to cryptocurrencies. (Decrypt)  South African regulators have proposed a strict cryptocurrency framework, in what could become the nation’s first comprehensive crypto laws. They recommend cryptocurrency “remain without legal tender status.”    Salesforce Backed Australian fintech unicorn and RippleNet member, Airwallex, raised $160 million in a fundraising round led by the investment arms of Australian ‘big four’ bank, ANZ, and San Francisco-based cloud software company, Salesforce. (Coin Telegraph)    Weekend Read: Climate Change    Blockchain’s often hyped attributes are a natural fit for governments seeking to mitigate global climate change. This effort necessarily requires diverse sets of governments and agencies to coordinate and account for their actions. Cryptocurrencies are evolving in ways that can incorporate automated internal governance of common resources and encourage collaboration among communities.  “How can financial and non-financial value be incorporated into digital currencies that promote, not simply the sustainable production, but the sustainable consumption patterns that are consistent with the decarbonized or net-zero lifestyle?” asks Tom Baumann, co-chair of the Climate Action group at the International Association for Trusted Blockchain Applications (INATBA). “It’s about being able to empower individuals to be more effective decision-makers.”  Blockchains can keep track of scarce digital units of value, which can be aligned in micro-economic systems to achieve common goals and favorable outcomes for communities. This could be as small as rewarding users of greener forms of public transport or developing a global carbon budget. “People are concerned about the truthfulness or credibility of sustainability claims. If blockchain can provide irrefutable transparent accountability then that will encourage people to have greater faith and willingness,” Baumann said.

42404488,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiUCQ,1587141008,"In Canada They're 'Essential,' In Argentina They're Shut Down: Bitcoin Miners Reckon With COVID-19","The “Great Lockdown” is redrawing the bitcoin mining landscape as the economic crisis makes smaller operations less profitable and access to China’s hardware supply chains crucial.      “Many miners are relying on the bitcoin price to increase post-halving in order to stay operationally profitable, and that's not an ideal situation for any business to operate in,” said F2Pool business director Thomas Heller, leading one of Asia’s largest bitcoin mining operations. “In early March, a number of miners had their bitcoin-backed loans liquidated, and other operators had to turn off their machines.”      It’s hard to say which miners now face crippling debts because few privately owned mining operations court publicity. Among those with public records, the Canadian startup Hut 8 owes roughly $14 million to Genesis Global Capital, an affiliate of the American crypto giant Genesis Trading (which is owned by CoinDesk’s parent company, Digital Currency Group).      Hut 8 CFO Jimmy Vaiopoulos said he is “comfortable with the debt level,” adding the repayment deadline is in 2021 and he expects the bitcoin price to increase long before that. The loan has an annual interest rate of 9.85 percent.      Read more: Bitcoin Halving, Explained      Canadian mining operations such as Hut 8 have an advantage over some competitors abroad: They are deemed “essential services” under the federal government's COVID-19 strategy, according to Bitfarms co-founder Emiliano Grodzki.      “This is the reason we can continue working,” Grodzki said of his Canadian company, unlike mining farms in his homeland, Argentina, where miners aren’t permitted to continue as usual.      Plus, with regards to profitability, Vaiopoulos said Hut 8 aims to have updated equipment from Chinese hardware suppliers, which is more efficient than current models.      “There were some delays in terms of equipment,” Vaiopoulos said. “But we’re kind of past that hump.”      However, over the past two months Hut 8 CEO Andrew Kiguel and board member Gerri Sinclair both resigned. During a public earnings call the first week of April, Kiguel said equipment timelines are still unclear, due to the ongoing pandemic.      “The world is grappling right now with different supply chain issues like getting ventilators and masks around the world as opposed to bitcoin mining machines,” Kiguel said during the call.      Read more: How Bitcoin’s Price Slump Is Changing the Geography of Mining      As such, many mining operations around the world are facing this same struggle. BitPatagonia co-founder Walter Salama in Argentina, whose mining farm is temporarily closed by the coronavirus lockdown, said the cost of new machines is his most pressing concern.      “Today the problem continues to be the high cost of machines that do not allow long-term planning,” Salama said. “Moving operations is very expensive. Each country should have the privilege of having mining companies and contribute to the blockchain.”      He predicted “medium and small miners” could disappear as those who provide funds and hardware “concentrate on the larger ones” while “praying to Bitcoin” for a bull market. If this happens, Salma added, it would undercut “the fantasy of decentralization.”      This is why Vaiopoulos said Hut 8 applied for an Emergency Wage Subsidy from the Canadian government, an ongoing program to help companies that have lost more than 30 percent of their revenue since 2019 continue to pay salaries.    Policy implications    It’s clear governments have a significant impact on whether bitcoin mining can remain profitable in their respective jurisdictions.      Generally speaking, mining operations require both cheap electricity and government leeway to stay competitive throughout volatile cycles. A longer political chilling effect took place in Iran from 2018 to the present. Iran was once home to a thriving bitcoin mining industry due, in part, to subsidized electricity. Then stricter government enforcement damped the domestic mining sector and made businesses even more vulnerable to supply chain disruptions.      Regions with robust mining companies, such as China and Russia, have supportive regulatory environments. Russia, in particular, is home to a state-owned power plant renting space to crypto miners.      Read more: A Russian Nuclear Plant Is Renting Space to Energy-Hungry Bitcoin Miners      If Salama manages to get and operate new hardware in Argentina before the halving in May, which will reduce miners’ rewards by 50 percent, local operating costs will still impact his profitability. For example, Chinese miners are expected to get lots of cheap energy during the annual “wet season,” July through September, thanks to national hydropower projects.      The strength of local currencies is yet another important factor. Due to the volatile fiat exchange rate, subject to both the Great Lockdown and national policies, Grodzki said Bitfarms’ operational expenses are now basically 10 percent cheaper.      “Our revenue is in bitcoin, which [buyers] value in U.S. dollars. But our operational expenditures are in Canadian dollars,” Grodzki said.      Russia’s mining industry witnessed a similar impact, where a decline in local currency value offset bitcoin’s own volatility. Even if the price of bitcoin goes down in dollars, it may be up in rubles.      Beyond Hut 8, volatility in both crypto and traditional currency markets may affect even more loans in the months to come. Bitfarms owes roughly $20 million to the New York-based Dominion Capital LLC.      “We will study opportunities for low-cost electricity in other parts of the world, like Latin America,” Grodzki said. “Miners in other parts of the world with [cheaper] electricity can sell their capacity. … We also expect to find another source of electricity cheaper than Canada.”      David Pan contributed reporting.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TRADING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/04/17/in-canada-theyre-essential-in-argentina-theyre-shut-down-bitcoin-miners-reckon-with-covid-19,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8f3ebedb9543a24decf4b31119cd6d4fe00930cb-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404482,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiU7V,1587132007,Spanish Researchers Working to Curb Coronavirus Spread With Blockchain App,"Researchers in Spain are racing to develop a smartphone app that leverages blockchain technology and artificial intelligence to help stem the coronavirus pandemic.      A team of more than 100 researchers from the Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca, the University of Salamanca and the Artificial Intelligence Research Institute are developing the app to predict the evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as ensuring government measures are being adhered to.      The app, which is currently at the proof-of-concept stage, would potentially also allow for health officials to make smarter decisions. For example, if there's an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases, officials can choose to order citizens to stay at home.      Using blockchain technology enables the app to give each participant a ""digital identity"" controlled by a private key that brings access a digital version of paper certificates issued by the government. These allow the confirmed healthy to leave home to buy food or to work, according to two lead researchers Juan Manuel Corchado and Javier Prieto, who spoke to IEEE Spectrum for a report on Thursday.      See also: How I’m Coping With Spain’s Coronavirus Lockdown      Corchado and Prieto said the team hopes to find the primary factors affecting the deadly coronavirus outbreak.      ""With our app we are trying to provide information gathered about the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the evolution of the virus,"" Corchado and Prieto said. ""We are also trying to support medical professionals and government officials about decisions they need to make regarding the pandemic, including social distancing and quarantine measures.""      As well as blockchain, the effort employs AI to help predict the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic based on patient information including genetic profiles, medical records and prior treatment of the virus. Utilizing what's known as the Deep Intelligence AI platform, they can make predictions on the behavior of the virus by combining data and information from scientific journals, news articles and healthcare records.

42404495,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiUHL,1587125700,Five Ways Blockchain Tech Can Help Us During This Pandemic,"Don and Alex Tapscott are the co-authors of Blockchain Revolution and co-founders of the Blockchain Research Institute. Alex’s new book is Financial Services Revolution. Together they wrote the report Blockchain Solutions in Pandemics.      This is one of those rare turning points in history. The COVID-19 pandemic will profoundly change our behavior and society. Many institutions will come under scrutiny and, we hope, change for the better.      At the Blockchain Research Institute, we’re doing our part to facilitate positive change. Technologies like artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, augmented/virtual reality, and above all, blockchain are more relevant than ever – not just to business and the economy but to the future of public health and the safety of global populations.      Traditional systems have failed us and it’s time for a new paradigm. To build on Victor Hugo, “Nothing is more powerful than an idea that has become a necessity.”    Health care crises and blockchain: A framework    Given the urgent need for global solutions, the Blockchain Research Institute convened a virtual roundtable of 30 experts from five continents. We discussed the challenges of COVID-19 and the possibilities of using blockchain in areas of need. In our special report, “Blockchain Solutions in Pandemics,” we developed a framework for facing pandemics together in these five areas.      1. Self-sovereign identity, health records and shared data      Data is the most important asset in fighting pandemics. If any useful data exists now, it sits in institutional silos. We need better access to the data of entire populations and a speedy consent-based data sharing system. To accelerate discovery, the blockchain startup Shivom is working on a global project to collect and share virus host data in response to a call for action from the European Union’s Innovative Medicines Initiative. In Honduras, Civitas – an app developed by the start-up Emerge – is linking Hondurans' government-issued ID numbers with blockchain records used to track medical appointments. Doctors simply scan the app to review a patient's symptoms verified and recorded by telemedicine services.      Dr. Raphael Yahalom of MIT and the Oxford-Hainan Research Institute is working on Trustup, a trust-reasoning framework that can systematically highlight the ways in which health data recorded on a blockchain ledger is more trustworthy than data stored in conventional databases. The trade-off between privacy and public safety need not be so stark. Through self-sovereign identities, where individuals own their health records and can freely volunteer it to researchers, we can achieve both.      2. Just-in-time supply chain solutions      Supply chains are critical infrastructure for our globally connected economy, and COVID-19 has put them under tremendous strain, exposing potential weaknesses in their design. We must rebuild supply chains to be transparent, where users can access information quickly and trust that it’s accurate. The start-up RemediChain is doing just that for the pharmaceutical supply. One of its co-founders, Dr. Philip Baker, was interested in tracking down and recycling unused but still efficacious medications such as those used for cancer. He saw blockchain as means of recovering their chain of custody:    By posting the medication and its expiration date, people all over the country can create a decentralized national inventory of surplus medication. When there is [a] sudden run on a previously ubiquitous medication like hydroxychloroquine, healthcare professionals can call on this surplus as a life-saving resource. The same principle applies for ventilators and PPE.    Blockchain serves as a “state machine” that gives us visibility into the state of our suppliers as well as the assets themselves. When COVID-19 hit, the start-up VeriTX – a virtual marketplace for digital assets like patented design files – pivoted to medical supplies, so that medical facilities could print the parts needed at one of the 180 3D printing facilities in VeriTX’s network. VeriTX can reverse-engineer a part and then build it much faster and at a lower cost than getting it from the original manufacturer or replacing the equipment.      3. Sustaining the economy: How blockchain can help      If supply chains are the machinery of global commerce, then money is its lubricant. Yet, money as a carrier of the disease has been a stressor during this pandemic. We highlight the what, why and how of digital cash as an alternative. Costs are also an issue. The Ethereum-based Solve.Care platform is dramatically lowering health-care administrative costs so that more of a patient’s medical budget goes directly to care. The health crisis has also become a financial crisis, closing off access to supply chain credit. We look at blockchain-based financing solutions such as Chained Finance and fundraising efforts like that of the Binance Charity Foundation. Finally, decentralized models of governance such as those created by blockchain startups Abridged and Aragon can transform how NGOs, governments, and communities respond to the crisis.      4. A rapid response registry for medical professionals      Front-line medical professionals are the heroes and our last line of defense. Yet, hospitals can’t onboard people fast enough. This is not for lack of talent; it’s the inability to find those with proper credentials. Blockchain platforms such as Dock.io, ProCredEx and Zinc.work help to streamline coordination among different geographies, departments, and certification bodies so that supply and demand for healthcare workers – as well as the process for verifying their skills – becomes more efficient and transparent.      5. Incentive models to reward responsible behavior      People respond to incentives. Blockchain serves as a mechanism to synch up the incentives of stakeholder groups around issues and activities, changing patterns of behavior in the process. For example, the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada collaborated with Interac to micro-motivate healthy lifestyles, and Toronto’s University Health Network teamed up with IBM to put control over health records into patients’ hands.    An action plan for the new paradigm    Many of these changes are beyond the timeframe of this round of COVID-19. But many can be implemented quickly.      Governments must wake up to the blockchain opportunity. Every national government should create an emergency task force on medical data to start planning and implementing blockchain initiatives. They can stimulate the development of technology firms working on the solutions described here. They should partner with medical professional associations and other players to implement blockchain credential systems.    We anticipate a real crisis of leadership as the new digital-first and digital-only models conflict with the old industrial tried-and-true.    The private sector affected by COVID-19 must still lead the way. They must start today by incorporating blockchain into their infrastructures. Companies need to continue their work on pilots framed around medical records, credentialing systems, incentive structures and other sovereign identity solutions. When designing these pilots, companies could consider embedding incentive systems for socially responsible behavior.      Emergencies turbocharge the pace of historical progress. Businesses like Zoom, once used mostly by technology companies, have become ubiquitous tools of daily life. Meanwhile, 20th century titans are asking for bailouts. By necessity, human behavior – from where we work and when to how we socialize – changes overnight. Add to this mix the exponential properties of blockchain, and we’re setting ourselves up for a cataclysm of some kind.      We anticipate a real crisis of leadership as the new digital-first and digital-only models conflict with the old industrial tried-and-true. Maybe this awful crisis will call forth a new generation of leaders who can help us finally get the digital age on track? Who among us will step up?",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH | BNB,"Don Tapscott, Alex Tapscott",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/04/17/five-ways-blockchain-tech-can-help-us-during-this-pandemic,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8171d54a5c772fd0273c26b757597ec2c22ecaea-2560x1706.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42404483,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiU6W,1587125096,Binance Unveils Smart Contract Blockchain but Claims It's No Ethereum Rival,"Binance has released a white paper detailing a new smart contract blockchain it says offers a high-performance base layer for decentralized apps – but might also be a challenger to Ethereum.      The cryptocurrency exchange said Friday the new Binance Smart Chain (BSC) would work as a smart contract layer running parallel to its existing Binance Chain. The new blockchain, it said, would have a new consensus mechanism and would be capable of fast trade executions designed to combine fast confirmation times with strong on-chain governance.      Although Binance does not explicitly state BSC would be a rival to Ethereum, and the company stressed to CoinDesk this was not the company's intent, the white paper hints the new smart contract layer could perform better on several key metrics.      For one thing, its low latency platform will have faster execution times. For another, its consensus mechanism – a hybrid of EOS' delegated proof of stake (dPoS) system and a proof of authority (PoA) system – is designed to be more efficient and environmentally friendly than Ethereum's proof of work (PoW). (It's worth noting that Ethereum is moving to PoS soon, via an upgrade informally dubbed Ethereum 2.0.)      Watch: Vitalik Buterin Explains the New Tech Behind Eth 2.0      Furthermore, in a statement to CoinDesk, a spokesperson said BSC was designed to ensure dapps could scale while still running on a high-performance layer to ensure a ""fast and smooth user experience."" That might give an edge over Ethereum, where scalability limitations have sometimes created bottlenecks leading to soaring transaction fees and extended confirmation times. Indeed, popular game CryptoKitties quickly became so popular that it managed to put a strain on the network.      Binance, which only moved its token Binance Coin off Ethereum in 2019, denied wants to challenge the original ""world computer,"" however.      On the contrary, the Binance spokesperson said the two would complement one another in growing the blockchain ecosystem: ""The industry needs more high-performance infrastructures, not just one single blockchain.""      Binance also wants to make BSC fully compatible with Ethereum. As it says in its white paper, it would give the new smart contract layer direct access to an ecosystem filled with ""relatively mature applications and community.""      One of the main problems that have beset other smart contract protocols is it can be devilishly difficult to convince existing dapps to move away from Ethereum. The process can be long and complicated: developer teams have to familiarize themselves with a new protocol and codebase. At the end of it, there's no guarantee existing users will follow them onto the new chain.      See also: ‘They Have the Users’: Binance CEO Explains Why He Bought CoinMarketCap      But by building a door straight into Ethereum, Binance could be looking to smooth the path making it easier for projects to switch protocols. As the exchange says in its white paper, being fully compatible means ""most of the [Ethereum] dApps, ecosystem components, and toolings will work with BSC and require zero or minimum changes.""      There have, of course, been other contenders for the mantel of ""Ethereum Killer,"" but Binance's innovation may be less the potential high-performance capability of the platform and more that it has minimized the risk for dapps migrating onto a new chain.      Maybe BSC's de facto motto should be: ""What have you got to lose?""

42404505,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiUOE,1587122784,First Mover: Stablecoin Surge Might Herald Bitcoin Binge,"Are crypto traders getting ready to pounce?      It sure looks that way, based on new data showing a rapid increase in the outstanding value of dollar-linked tokens, many of them amassing on cryptocurrency exchanges.      These ""stablecoins"" – digital tokens whose value is linked to government-issued currencies like U.S. dollars – have become the de facto form of cash in fast-evolving cryptocurrency markets. Unlike actual dollars, they can easily be held or moved around within the digital ecosystem, between exchanges, wallets and lenders that are willing to pay juicy interest rates of 8 percent or more for the deposits.      You're reading First Mover, CoinDesk's daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      In the past month, the outstanding value of the top six dollar-linked tokens has surged by more than 25 percent to about $8 billion, according to CoinDesk Research.      Traders and individuals might have bought the stablecoins in the digital-market equivalent of a flight to cash as the coronavirus wreaked havoc on the global economy – similar to the way traditional investors rushed to liquidate everything from stocks to bonds, choosing to park the proceeds in U.S. dollars until markets stabilize.      But traders also might be flocking to stablecoins as an intermediary step before betting big on cryptocurrencies: First use dollars or other government-issued currencies to buy stablecoins; next, move those stablecoins onto cryptocurrency exchanges; then, when the price is right, trade the digital cash for bitcoin, ether or other tokens.      ""The ones that are on exchanges, in theory, are going to be deployed back into cryptocurrency when sentiment changes,"" Ryan Watkins, research analyst at the crypto-market data provider Messari, said in a phone interview. ""It's definitely something that investors are looking at.""      Stablecoins have been a hot topic since last year, when Facebook announced plans to launch libra, a digital token that could be used for payments between the social network's two-billion-plus users. Initially, the token was designed to be backed by a basket of government currencies, but on Thursday the consortium behind libra said it now plans to issue stablecoins representing individual currencies, such as the U.S. dollar.      Governments from China to Sweden have explored issuance of digital versions of their own currencies that might address the growing competition from stablecoin issuers, which are essentially building private monetary systems atop blockchain computer networks.      And these stablecoins, including tether (USDT), Circle's USD Coin (USDC), Paxos standard token (PAX) and Gemini Dollar (GUSD), suddenly appear in high demand.      Tether, the most popular stablecoin by far with an outstanding market value of about $7.2 billion, even trades at a slight premium to its purported $1 par value – an indication of how eager buyers are to accumulate the digital cash:      Greg Cipolaro, co-founder of crypto-market analysis firm Digital Asset Research, says individuals in some countries, possibly including China, might be trying to move money out of their domestic currencies. And it might be easier to exchange their local currencies for stablecoins than to get their hands on actual dollars.      As the dominant currency used in international finance, dollars have been in high demand as the coronavirus spread, triggering widespread job losses, business disruptions, travel cancellations and energy price slides. The attendant withering of consumer demand tends to push down prices – or, put another way, increases the dollar's purchasing power.      The Federal Reserve has been trying to offset the deflationary impulse by pumping newly minted dollars into the global financial system.      The U.S. Dollar Index – a measure of the currency's strength in foreign exchange markets against the euro, British pound, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, Swedish krona and Swiss franc – has climbed to a reading of 100.10, from 96.50 at the start of the year. Emerging-market currencies have sold off even harder: The Mexican peso has weakened 28 percent against the U.S. dollar so far in 2020.      ""That could be one issue,"" Cipolaro said in a phone interview. ""People are cashing in their fiat.""      So far, the surging stablecoin issuance hasn't translated into a big surge in prices for bitcoin, the oldest and largest cryptocurrency, which has a total market value of about $129 billion.      After a coronavirus-driven market swoon in late February and early March, followed by a rapid rebound, bitcoin prices appear to have stabilized – stagnated, some bulls might complain – in a range between roughly $6,500 and $7,400.      So a stablecoin-fueled buying spree could jolt the bitcoin market out of the doldrums.      ""Maybe it's just a coiled spring,"" Cipolaro said.      According to Glassnode, a blockchain data and intelligence provider, investors have moved some $1 billion of tether onto wallets at cryptocurrency exchanges:      Mati Greenspan, founder of the analysis firm Quantum Economics, suggested some holders of stablecoins might be looking to get out, after the international Financial Stability Board earlier this week suggested that the grassroots market might need closer scrutiny. One concern was that the wider use of the stablecoins could test ""the financing conditions of the wider financial system,"" according to a consultation report.      That concern might apply specifically in the case of tether, which mostly operates outside of the U.S. regulatory framework and is under investigation by the New York Attorney General's office.      ""If people are concerned that the government is going to start regulating those assets, they have very few options for what to do,"" Greenspan said in an audio chat over Telegram. ""They can try to convert it back to fiat money, but my guess is there's probably a reason they didn't want to hold it in fiat in the first place.""      Neil Van Huis, director of sales and institutional trading at digital asset financial services firm Blockfills, told CoinDesk's Daniel Cawrey that ""offshore and non-U.S. participation in getting access to [the U.S. dollar] through stablecoins is the culprit” behind the rise in stablecoin issuance.      So where will those holders go when they trade in their stablecoins?      ""Most likely into bitcoin,"" Greenspan said.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    Bitcoin is struggling to extend Thursday's bullish move amid improved risk appetite in traditional markets.      The top cryptocurrency is trading near $7,100 at press time, slightly down on the day. Meanwhile, futures tied to the S&P 500 are up over 2 percent and major European indices are flashing green, tracking overnight gains in Asian stocks.      The risk reset began during Asian hours after leaked details of U.S.-based Gilead Sciences' clinical trial of an antiviral drug called Remdesivir that suggest promising results in treating the coronavirus.      The renewed hope of coronavirus treatment overshadowed China's economic data, which showed the world's second-largest economy contracted by 6.8 percent in annualized terms in the first quarter.      Bitcoin has closely tracked action in the equity markets over the past several weeks and could soon pick up a strong bid.      Technical charts also indicate the path of least resistance is to the higher side. Bitcoin closed on Thursday (UTC) above the long-held 50-day average hurdle, signaling an end of the price pullback from the recent highs above $7,450 and opening the doors for a re-test of that level. Similar sentiments are being echoed by the descending channel breakout on the 4-hour chart.      First Mover is CoinDesk's daily markets newsletter.

Daily trading volume in bitcoin options listed on major exchanges – Deribit, LedgerX, Bakkt, OKEx, and CME – rose to $86.4 million on Thursday, the highest since March 16, according to data provided by crypto derivatives research firm Skew.      Netherland-based Deribit, the biggest cryptocurrency exchange by options volume, contributed more than 85 percent of the total daily trading volume. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which is synonymous with institutional activity, traded $832,000 worth of options contracts, a meager 1 percent of the global volume.      Aggregate open interest or number of outstanding option contracts also ticked higher to $642.3 million on Thursday, having bottomed out below $400 million in March.      Meanwhile, bitcoin’s price printed a high of $7,200 and closed Thursday with a 4.5 percent gain, its biggest single-day rise since April 6, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.      Importantly, the top cryptocurrency by the market value found acceptance above key average resistance at $7,000.      The breakout has revived the stalled uptrend from March lows and could fuel a rise toward $8,000 in the days leading up to the May 2020 halving. The event will reduce rewards per block mined on bitcoin’s blockchain by 50 percent to 6.25 BTC.      Read more: Bitcoin Halving, Explained      Some observers expect the impending supply cut to bode well for bitcoin’s price. “Next month’s halving should serve as a catalyst for more bullish medium to long term price action,” said Lennard Neo, head of research at Stack.      Options market activity, however, suggests investors are making bets (buying put options), possibly to hedge against a potential post-halving price drop or another March-like macro-driven crash in the crypto markets.      The increased demand for put options is reflected in the rise of the put-call open interest ratio to a seven-week high of 0.63, according to Skew data.      Further, one-month, three-month, and six-month 25-delta skews are reporting positive values at press time – a sign that puts are claiming higher prices or drawing stronger demand than call options.      A put option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation to sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. Meanwhile, a call option represents the right to buy.      Also Read: Options Market Signals Doubt Bitcoin Price Will Rise After Halving      It remains to be seen if halving powers strong gains in bitcoin. Meanwhile, stocks look to have bottomed out on the back of the Federal Reserve's unprecedented monetary stimulus. Bitcoin, therefore, could remain better bid in the days leading up to the event.      At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $7,100, representing little change on the day. It is, however, up more than 80 percent from the low of $3,867 registered on March 13.      Meanwhile. traditional markets are reporting an improved risk appetite. Futures tied to the S&P 500 are up over 2 percent alongside impressive gains in the European equities.

42404489,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiUBR,1587117600,"Russians Troll Government COVID-19 App With 1-Star Ratings, Harsh Reviews","MOSCOW — Like many other states, Russia's government is looking for new electronic surveillance tools during the COVID-19 pandemic. Citizens are not taking it well.      The Ministry of Communications released a mobile app this week to “provide electronic services potentially needed during the outbreak of the coronavirus,” and especially for issuing electronic permissions for going outside. Smartphone users in Russia are giving it low ratings and leaving bad reviews in the Android and iOS app stores. Some are reporting the government-backed app to Google and Apple in the hopes of getting it removed, an action usually taken for copyright infringement or inappropriate content.      In Moscow, the lockdown was imposed on March 29. Other cities and regions in Russia are following Moscow’s lead to varying degrees. There is no obligatory national lockdown at this point.      Since April 15, individuals in Moscow who want to leave home have needed electronic permission. It comes in the form of a QR code, issued on the city administration website after registered users enter their name, location, destination and reason for travel. In other parts of Russia the app will serve as a source of electronic permission.      The practice immediately provoked an outcry from privacy advocates, earning the electronic permission system the nickname “cyber Gulag,” CNN reported. The system also appeared incapable of sustaining a massive volume of requests — the Moscow city administration website went down during the first day of electronic permissions. The authorities blamed “DDoS attacks from abroad.”      See also: Why Tech-Minded Climate Groups See COVID-19 as a Trial Run for Massive Change      The system also generated massive traffic on roads leading to Moscow and crowds in the subway entrances on the first day of operation, with people waiting in long lines to get their QR codes checked by unprepared police officers.    One-star ratings    The app, released on April 12, had been downloaded over one million times on Google Play (Apple's app store does not show this metric) and received over 23,800 reviews on both services. Most reviews gave the app a one-star rating out of five, citing privacy concerns and effectively driving the rating to 1.3 stars.      “Privacy laws in Russia are far from being perfect, but several functions of this app violate even those laws. Please avoid using it if you respect your own privacy and privacy of others,” one Google Play user wrote in his review.      “This app doesn’t comply with GDPR and violates the Constitution of Russian Federation!” another user wrote in his App Store review.      According to the app's privacy policy, it can gather and analyze information such as the user's full name, date of birth, home address, location data, phone number, medical history, health insurance, foreign passport numbers and travels abroad.      The users who downloaded the app also reported it can demand taking a selfie, which would mean access to the mobile phone camera is also required, at least at some point of usage.    Security concerns    “People have a lot of questions about this app: Why do you need to provide so much personal data just to step outside of your home?” said Artem Kozlyuk, founder of RosKomSvoboda, a non-profit monitoring online censorship and surveillance practices in Russia. (RosKomSvoboda, roughly translated as “Russia’s Communications Freedom,” is a play on the name of the country’s internet censorship agency).      Aside from fears of the government abusing citizens’ privacy there is another concern: If the app's data vault is not protected securely enough, it won’t take long until fresh loads of stolen personal data will flood the dark web, Kozlyuk said.      Weak operational security and corruption in Russian law enforcement have already lead to multiple leaks over the past decade, when the databases of traffic police and the migration control service were freely available for purchase, with sellers hawking CDs in subway trains as well as archives online.      “Plus, it’s not clear what will happen to all this data once the pandemic is over. It’s not transparent to the society. We see all around the world the countries introducing measures like this and Russia is joining with its own digital repressions,” Kozlyuk said.    Big Brother goes global    Russia is in good company. Late last month, for example, the Federal Bureau of Investigation released an app in the U.S. for exercising while under quarantine, which appeared to be tracking users' location and mobile phone data.      Governments in China, Australia, Norway, Israel and other countries have also released various software products for tracking citizens via their smartphones.      Also read: After Coronavirus ‘War,’ Bretton Woods-Style Shakeup Could Dethrone the Dollar      On April 2, RosKomSvoboda launched an interactive map called Pandemic Big Brother for monitoring the new surveillance measures and restrictions being introduced in the countries around the world due to the COVID-19 pandemic.      “We are monitoring for restrictions of civil rights that are realized with digital technologies,"" the website says.

Rep. Sylvia Garcia, a member of the House Financial Services Committee, said Thursday the consortium's revised roadmap ""does not address the concerns I raised"" in the past.      ""There are simply too many questions left unanswered regarding why Facebook is even developing a cryptocurrency and how it will affect the global economy and consumers,"" the Texas Democrat said in a statement. (Strictly speaking, Facebook set up the Libra Association last June, and its Calibra subsidiary is one of 22 members of the group developing the project.)      ""Facebook and the Libra Association had an opportunity to address the concerns I and my other colleagues raised with their initial whitepaper,"" Garcia went on, referring to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's congressional testimony last fall. ""Unfortunately they chose not to listen to the bipartisan concerns raised about libra.""      Garcia's comments suggest libra's roots as a Facebook initiative remain a political liability despite the consortium's steps to appease critics.      Read more: Libra Scales Back Global Currency Ambitions in Concession to Regulators      Libra's original, more ambitious plan called for a new global digital currency backed by a basket of fiat currencies from different countries. This was one of the main reasons it was unpopular with politicians, regulators and central bankers worldwide, who feared it would threaten their monetary sovereignty.      Their pushback spooked big-name association members PayPal and Mastercard, who bailed on the project in October. In the scaled-back version announced Thursday, libra will instead issue a series of stablecoins, each tied to a specific sovereign currency.    Cato, others react    ""Because it makes libra functionally equivalent to PayPal and other electronic payment networks with which they are familiar, the new plan should be less discomfiting to central bankers,"" wrote Diego Zuluaga, a policy analyst at the Cato Institute’s Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives, in a blog post.      Garcia noted disapprovingly that the revised white paper ""retains a libra coin backed by a basket of assets."" However, the plan is now for this coin to be backed by other stablecoins, not directly by cash held at banks.      Further, the composition of the basket will now likely be overseen by regulators and central bankers, not fully controlled by the association, as blockchain skeptic David Gerard noted on his blog.      ""Libra is being forced to turn into PayPal-but-it's-Facebook – with the back-end system running on a blockchain, for no reason except to say it's on a blockchain,"" Gerard quipped.      Also read: Circle CEO Claims ‘Explosive’ Stablecoin Demand From Everyday Businesses      In October, Garcia introduced a bill to classify stablecoins as securities and subject their issuers to oversight by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

42404485,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiU8U,1587109939,Bitcoin Mining Hardware War Is Heating Up Ahead of the Halving,"Shenzhen-based MicroBT is rolling out three top-of-the-line bitcoin miners amid heated competition with Bitmain ahead of the network's halving event in less than 30 days.      Chen Jianbing, COO of MicroBT, announced in an online event on Friday that the three new models – the WhatsMiner M30S+, M30S++ and M31S+ – are available via both warehouse inventory and pre-orders that can be delivered in up to 30 days.      The move underscores MicroBT's neck-and-neck competition in the multi-billion-dollar mining hardware market with major rival Bitmain, which is scheduled to deliver the first batch of its latest AntMiner S19 and S19 Pro miners in May.      At the event, Chen reemphasized MicroBT's rapid growth in 2019, having achieved sales of 600,000 units of its WhatsMiner M20 series, which, as CoinDesk reported in February, has chipped away at Bitmain's longstanding market dominance.      The COO said 2019 sales volume had also doubled compared with 2018, boosting its sold computing power to 35 million terahashes per second (TH/s). That accounted for 35 percent of the Bitcoin network's total hash rate as of the end of December.      The new models add to MicroBT's existing M30 product line, which includes the previously launched WhatsMiner M30S and M31S.    Efficiency war    With the latest equipment from both major manufacturers soon to start shipping, the bitcoin mining hardware market is now entering what Chen called the ""3X era,"" referring to a mining efficiency that's below 40 watts per terahash (W/T).      For context, W/T measures how much electricity a mining machine consumes for each terahash of computing power. Since bitcoin mining is an energy-intensive computing process, a miner with a lower W/T ratio would be able to bring home a higher gross margin.      This metric has become considerably more important given the upcoming bitcoin halving, which will reduce the amount of bitcoin earned by the mining industry in a day from around 1,800 to 900 units.      Read more: Bitcoin Halving, Explained      According to the firm's specifications, the M30S+ is able to compute at a 100 TH/s with 34 W/T efficiency, while the M30S++ can compute as much as 112 TH/s at 31 W/T. The previously launched M30S is claimed to deliver an efficiency of 38 W/T.      Meanwhile, the M31S+ and the earlier M31S both deliver an efficiency of 42 W/T. However, Chen said the new model has the option to switch to a lower voltage mode in order to improve the efficiency to below 40 W/T.      To put this into perspective, by Bitmain's specification, AntMiner S19 and S19 Pro machines are said to be able to compute at 95 TH/s and 110 TH/s with an efficiency of 34 W/T and 30 W/T, respectively.    Tough times    But arguably miner manufacturers are all facing a tough time selling equipment under current market conditions, with mining operations taking a step back to wait and see how bitcoin's price will play out after halving.      Major manufacturers have had to mark down the prices of their mining equipment following bitcoin's price crash on March 12, the largest sell-off since 2013.      Vincent Zhang, MicroBT's head of sales, said during the launch event the WhatsMiner M30S is now priced at $1,962 – down from around $2,500 when it was initially released. For the new models announced today, the M30S+ and M30S++ are priced at $2,740 and $3,899 per unit, respectively.      Following the recent price cuts, manufacturers such as Bitmain have also had to partially refund customers who placed pre-orders at the higher price, a policy the firm has had in place for the past several years.      Zhang said MicroBT is now also enforcing such a policy in its bid to keep customers happy. Users who have placed pre-orders at a higher price than the retail value at the time of delivery will be compensated for the difference, like with Bitmain, in cash coupons. These can only be redeemed at up to 10 percent of the value of additional goods purchased by MicroBT.      Although MicroBT gained a large amount of market share in 2019, it had issues delivering devices on the timeline it had promised to customers, suffering up to several months of delays.      Read more: Another Bitcoin Mining Firm Warns COVID-19 Pandemic May Harm Its Business      Zhang said the firm will now compensate customers in cash coupons worth 0.3 percent of the value of a pre-ordered machine for each day a delivery is delayed beyond the promised date.      Also notably, MicroBT will extend its warranty policy for the M30 series to one year post-delivery – longer than the industry's average six-month warranty period.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/17/bitcoin-mining-hardware-war-is-heating-up-ahead-of-the-halving,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9adfe49e7a045ec5c6af1d77ab96edb840b76260-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404487,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiUAS,1587105000,South Africa Proposes Strict Crypto Regulatory Framework,"South Africa’s financial regulators recommended cryptocurrency “remain without legal tender status” in a Tuesday roadmap outlining what could become the nation's first comprehensive crypto laws.    According to the policy paperhttps://www.ifwg.co.za/wp-content/uploads/IFWG_CAR_WG-Position_Paper_on_Crypto_Assets.pdf by South Africa’s “Intergovernmental Fintech Working Group” (IFWG), the burgeoning crypto asset sector – one survey suggests 10.7 percent of South African internet users invest in bitcoin – is past due for strict financial oversight, a licensure structure, closer cash flow monitoring and more.    “Crypto assets and the various activities associated with this innovation can no longer remain outside of the regulatory perimeter,” said the IFWG, whose members include the South African Reserve Bank, the Financial Sector Conduct Authority and the National Treasury, among others. “Clear policy stances” must be formed.      The policy paper would implement strict crypto oversight domestically. It would codify the Financial Action Task Force’s “new technologies” anti-money-laundering and “Travel Rule” recommendations, two international baselines for policing crypto businesses. Those businesses would also need to register with the AML watchdog the Financial Intelligence Centre.      Read more: Inside the Standards Race for Implementing FATF’s Travel Rule      Crypto would face new formal restrictions on when and how it can be used. For example, the policy paper calls for a prohibition against using crypto as a settlement tool within South Africa’s financial infrastructure, but asks that crypto be recognized “for domestic payment purposes,” and be regulated accordingly.      “Payments using crypto assets will, in the interim period, be subjected to a regulatory sandbox approach,” the IFWG said.      On the matter of raising capital, the paper says Initial Coin Offering regulations “must be aligned, as far as possible” with South Africa’s traditional securities governance schemes. Even so, payment and utility tokens would also have to submit their white papers to the regulators.      The policy recommendations follow IFWG’s previous crypto consultation paper, issued in Jan 2019.

42404496,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiUIK,1587090913,Circle CEO Claims 'Explosive' Stablecoin Demand From Everyday Businesses,"Four months after Circle pivoted to stablecoins, the startup’s new business model has received an unexpected boost from the global coronavirus crisis, said co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire.      U.S. dollar-backed blockchain tokens are surging in popularity around the world, and this time much of the demand is for payments in normal business transactions, not just to move money quickly between cryptocurrency exchanges, Allaire claimed.      “Over the past several weeks, we have seen explosive interest and growth in USDC,” he said, referring to the stablecoin Circle issues in partnership with Coinbase. “There is clearly very significant global demand for digital dollars, and the use of digital dollars as a new payment medium.”      New signups have come from e-commerce marketplaces, advertising networks, luxury goods producers, recruiting platforms, digital content markets, peer-to-peer lending platforms, payment companies, software firms, professional services firms, rewards businesses, mobile banking providers and other internet companies, Allaire said.      “We are getting feedback from Asian market participants that there is more and more demand for USDC from SMEs seeking both the safety and utility of digital dollars,” he said, using a term for small and medium-sized enterprises.      See also: Millions in Crypto Is Crossing the Russia-China Border Daily. There, Tether Is King      The company saw the number of Circle Business Accounts – introduced last month for corporate clients to conduct business using USDC – grow 700 percent over the past few weeks, with more than two-thirds of these businesses coming from outside the crypto space.    Double-digit growth    According to CoinMetrics, USDC’s market capitalization, which equals the amount in circulation since it trades at par for dollars, has jumped 65 percent, from $444 million on March 1 to $734 million at press time.      Allaire's explanation for the surge suggests the crisis is accelerating mainstream adoption of blockchain technology, albeit a relatively tame variant. As a stablecoin, USDC is designed to hold its value against the dollar, not gyrate in price like bitcoin. It's backed by real-world dollars held in a bank, for which it can be redeemed on demand.      “We believe we are seeing a real turning point in the adoption of digital currency,” Allaire said.      See also: Circle Rolls Out Stablecoin Business Accounts, Preps SeedInvest for Sale      This much is clear: Dollars, digital or otherwise, have been in hot demand over the past several weeks as the pandemic has prompted investors to flock to safe havens.      “We’re seeing record amounts of transaction volume,” Allaire said, adding that adoption “is relatively evenly distributed across Western and Asian markets.”    Dollar substitutes    Nor is USDC alone in achieving double-digit growth.      According to CoinMetrics, over the past six weeks, the Paxos Standard (PAX) grew 22 percent, from $198 million to $258 million; tether (USDT) grew 36 percent from $4.6 billion to $6.3 billion and the Gemini dollar (GUSD) grew from $3.9 million to $6.2 million, or up 6 percent. The Binance dollar (BUSD) issued with Paxos saw the fastest growth, from $68 million to nearly $200 million, or up a whopping 194 percent.      Stablecoins issued on the Ethereum blockchain are seeing enough of a boost that value transfer on the network is equal to the values on the Bitcoin network.      See also: Ethereum Now Matches Bitcoin on One Key Metric      This apparent boom in dollar substitutes comes as Libra, the consortium set up last year by Facebook, has walked back its plan to create a global digital currency, refocusing on stablecoins tied to individual national currencies.      The concept of a digital dollar has been gaining traction elsewhere. On Thursday, a group of U.S. lawmakers introduced a bill proposing a digital dollar (though not a blockchain-based one) as a tool for distributing stimulus payments to U.S. residents.
