42399735,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbybdd,1492201920,The DAO Ethereum Classic Refund Effort Has Been Extended,"UPDATE (14th April 21:50 BST): This article has been updated to reflect that the ETC refund effort has been extended to January 2018.      Some background: last summer, a project called The DAO raised more than a hundred million dollars worth of ether – the cryptocurrency underlying the ethereum network – as part of a bid to create a smart contract-based funding vehicle for ethereum-related projects.  Yet a flaw in the code was exploited, allowing an attacker to effectively walk away with tens of millions worth of ether – effectively scuttling the project in the process. It also sparked an effort to secure some of those funds on behalf of DAO investors, a process that wasn’t without controversy.  Ultimately, the drive to unwind the effects of the DAO collapse resulted in two distinct ethereum-derived blockchains: ethereum and ethereum classic. In the end, contracts were set up allowing users to exchange their DAO tokens for both ether and classic ether.  Community members have been pushing for users to withdraw their funds, but as noted above, just over 1.5m classic ethers – worth just over $4m at press time – haven't been accessed.  Yet a plan to transfer the remaining funds to the group that originally secured them has drawn its share of critics.  Some have taken to social media to argue that the money represents stolen property that should be returned to their respective owners, or should at least be left untouched within a defunct smart contract.  Notably, the other major DAO-related withdrawal contract, for the exchange of DAO tokens for ETH, contains more than 450k unclaimed ethers, worth roughly $21m at current prices.

42399745,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbybnT,1492183880,Zcash Releases Software Fix After Denial-of-Service Bug Discovery,"The development team behind the zcash project has released a new software update following the discovery of a denial-of-service vulnerability.  In a new blog post, developers Zooko Wilcox and Paige Peterson detailed how the bug could enable an attacker to crash a zcash node remotely by sending a certain kind of transaction.  The bug was traced to a change included in the project’s 1.0.4 release, related to how transactions are given priority in a node’s mempool. Word first emerged that a vulnerability had been discovered on Wednesday.  The post explained:  ""ZcashCo, and several exchanges, wallet vendors, and miners have already deployed a mitigation as well as detectors for this attack vector. No attacks have been detected.""  Zcash published an update addressing the bug, advising users to upgrade in order to eliminate the remote-crash risk. The team behind the project also said that, should signs emerge that an attack attempt is being made, it would issue alerts and coordinate with related services on a response.

42399729,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbybYi,1492180418,Inside TrueBit: Ethereum's Lesser-Known Scalability Effort,"An under-the-radar effort to supercharge ethereum smart contracts is gaining momentum.  While it may seem like another in-progress scalability project, TrueBit is distinguished by its developer team, including developer Christian Reitwiessner, creator of the network's Solidity smart contracting language, and mathematician Jason Teutsch.  Announced last year, TrueBit's goal is to enable support for more powerful smart contract computations on the distributed application platform – the most ambitious of which are those that would be needed for applications like rendering photos or machine learning and artificial intelligence.  The scaling issues inherent in public blockchain architecture are known, but computational power could prove a significant problem for ethereum, which looks to be a 'world computer' that supports a richer variety of complex applications similar to those found in an average app store.  Proof-of-stake  , the Raiden Network, sharding and state channels are all initiatives aiming to improve ethereum's scale. In this way, TrueBit is an addition to the pantheon.  The creators foresee a way to increase ethereum's computational power by harnessing another distributed network that would conduct and verify computation, while disagreements would be settled on the ethereum blockchain. In theory, this would limit the workload placed on the lower levels of the system, where data is stored by a large network of global nodes.  TrueBit founder and University of Alabama at Birmingham postdoc Jason Teutsch told CoinDesk:  ”[Today,] smart contracts can only do very trivial tasks from a computational point of view. Basically, what TrueBit does is to give smart contracts the ability of doing scalable computations.”  Hitting limits  So, what's wrong with the system today? Currently, ethereum has a 'gas limit' that puts a cap on the network's computational power per block.  This is roughly equivalent to bitcoin's limit on the transactions it includes in each block, though the gas limit is dynamically set by miners as opposed to being hard-coded into the network.  To date, the gas limit has already given rise to issues. For example, miners last year temporarily lowered the gas limit to thwart attacks on the network, impacting the operations of ethereum apps and companies.  Yet, without such a limit, Teutsch said, a problem known as the 'verifier's dilemma' arises, and miners are incentivized to accept unverified scripts into the blocks they mine.  ""If you allow unbounded computation with ethereum smart contracts – the way they are right now – you would not only get denial of service attacks, but you would also end up getting wrong answers on the blockchain,"" he said.  Computational court  Finding a workaround to these limits is where TrueBit and similar projects come in.  Like other next-generation blockchain projects, TrueBit uses a layer above the blockchain to do the heavy lifting. In this case, it outsources the verification of computations.  Rather than each and every node computing each and every smart contract, participants in the market – potentially anyone who owns a computer – perform this task. These participants are called 'solvers' and they submit a solution to the problem for a reward, while 'validators' check their work.  The project's white paper describes the TrueBit system as a 'verification game', where a market of off-blockchain computers verify computations. If even one participant disagrees with a solver's result, they can kick it to the blockchain to settle the dispute.  And the system aims to incentivize players to act in a trustworthy manner.  ""At the end of this game, either the cheating solver will be discovered and punished, or the challenger will pay for the resources consumed by the false alarm,"" the paper explains.  Already, the computationally heavy distributed application Golem, a market for CPU and GPU power, intends to use TrueBit, as opposed to the ethereum blockchain.  Stranger applications  However, there are other applications for TrueBit, Teutsch suggested. Dogethereum, a project aiming to connect the dogecoin blockchain to ethereum's, is one he is particularly excited about.  Dogethereum is different from other 'bridge' attempts, such as BTC Relay (which bridges bitcoin and ethereum), in that it could allow users to export currency instead of having to switch currencies between blockchains.  BTC Relay allows users to pay for ethereum applications with bitcoin, but it does not transfer the currency to ethereum, Teutsch said.  ""In contrast, the Dogethereum bridge, as we envision it implementing with TrueBit, would effectively allow users to export currency from dogecoin to ethereum without (necessarily) making dogecoin transactions visible to ethereum smart contracts,"" he said.  Others have come to TrueBit with application ideas, as well, such as using it to stream video on Livepeer, which Teutsch described as a ""YouTube without the YouTube"". And still others, such as Gnosis, are working on separate off-chain computational scaling.  Will TrueBit help power this new wave of applications?  That answer seems uncertain. However, Teutsch said that it looks like they might deploy the technology on both ethereum classic and bitcoin-bound smart contract platform Rootstock in the near future.  Either way, the project shows the continued demand for scaling, and the many ways developers on the ethereum network are taking to attack the issue.

42399738,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbybhZ,1492176494,Maine Lawmakers Kill Blockchain Voting Study Proposal,"A legislative proposal to study the use of blockchain technology for elections in Maine has failed, public records show.  As reported last month by CoinDesk, Senator Eric Brakey introduced a proposal to create a commission to study whether the tech could be applied to the state’s elections process.  According to the text of the proposal, the commission would have explored blockchain to see if it could ""support and enhance Maine's current paper ballot election system for the purpose of improving paper ballot security, increasing election transparency and reducing costs"". If passed, the measure would have led to the development of a report on the subject, to be delivered by early December.  Yet as shown in public records, a senate committee elected to place the measure in Maine's legislative archives, essentially scuttling it for the foreseeable future. A legislative aide confirmed the move when asked for comment by CoinDesk.  Despite the failure, the concept of blockchain-based voting has been explored elsewhere.  Notably, a South Korean community government utilized the tech in a local funding ballot that saw roughly 9,000 votes submitted. South Korean-based blockchain startup Blocko contributed the technology for that initiative.

42399739,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbybiY,1492171216,More Consortia? Banks See Model as Vital to DLT Efforts,"Nearly three-quarters of banks and asset managers see the consortium model as necessary for exploring distributed ledger tech, according to a new survey released last week.  For the survey, international law firm Simmons & Simmons polled 200 C-suite representatives as part of a larger exploration of how they view financial technology opportunities. Notably, while most were positive about the consortium model, there were hints that there may be some weaknesses to the approach.  For example, 60% reported some existing consortia have too many participants, while 68% expressed a desire to have more control over the work ongoing in these groups.  Further, 40% reported a belief that joining an industry consortium could have a negative effect on their firm's competitive advantage, with 38% asserting that they'd rather focus on internal solutions to new technology challenges.  Yet, report author Angus McLean also noted the operational difficulties inherent in this sentiment, given that it's widely believed blockchain and distributed ledger systems require a network effect to reduce costs and offer benefits.  McLean wrote:  ""For distributed ledger-based solutions, for example, there is little point in having systems that work for only a small segment of the industry. The value is generated by enabling a network effect.""  In this way, the report cited the work unveiled last year by Utility Settlement Coin – a project UBS, Deutsche Bank, Santander, BNY Mellon and ICAP made public last year – as an example of a consortium it believes may be the right size in the current climate.  Still, the survey provides an interesting glimpse into the sentiment among banks participating in consortia efforts, perhaps shedding light on the future challenges to the model.

42421810,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXvKY9,1492167637,Offense or Defense? How to Win the Blockchain Game,"Ben Jessel is a managing principal at Capco, a global business and technology consultancy dedicated solely to the financial services industry (and FIS company).  In this opinion piece, Jessel discusses how organizations are adapting to blockchain technology, and how advances in the field are creating new competitive pressures for financial markets participants.  Today, financial services companies need to have a 'winner takes all' mentality in order to secure a competitive advantage in the marketplace.  Just to stay ahead of the pack, these companies are now investing hundreds of millions of dollars in advanced computer and data hardware in order to shave thousandths of seconds off the time it takes to make a trade.  What complicates matters is the fact that successful blockchain innovation requires a far more collaborative approach than before, so being first to market actually involves being first with an ecosystem primed to function with other financial institutions – a far more complex undertaking.  Many in financial services are talking about this next wave of innovation that promises to deliver a profound change. In particular, blockchain and distributed ledger technology offer the ability for financial institutions to significantly improve their efficiency and reduce prices.  If successful, blockchain will remove the middlemen just like electronic exchanges brought buyers and sellers together. Ultimately, this technology has the potential to fundamentally shift the economics of certain financial markets.  Quick change  Innovation – through new technology and business models – has the potential to change industries very quickly.  This is especially true in an industry like financial services where there is a great deal of capital at stake, and a small difference of a fraction of a cent in transaction costs can mean the difference between success and failure.  However, innovating is not without its risk. An incorrectly timed entry into the market and the lack of refinement of the product or service can challenge success.  The question remains whether blockchain and distributed ledger tech will have the same profound effect of innovations from the past decade. Is it a case of 'winner takes all' for those who are the first to adopt blockchain?  The answer from surveying those in the industry is that, in some cases, it does appear to be so, and in other areas it is less clear.  There are situations for certain institutions where there is benefit in 'playing offense' with blockchain and distributed ledger technology. In other areas, particularly concerning financial middlemen, blockchain represents an existential threat so profound that they need to be first to market with a defensive play that redefines their role and keeps them relevant.  Exacerbating this challenge is that proven innovations have typically worked within the framework of the financial services ecosystem – no matter how arcane it may be – rather than rewriting it. But blockchain innovation will require changing the fundamental plumbing of the financial ecosystem.  Building networks  The easiest path for blockchain adoption involves rewiring markets where there is little infrastructure today, or better still, the creation of new markets that do not exist today by building networks that bridge the gap between those needing access to capital and those with the funds to invest.  In some cases, savings with blockchain are potentially so profound that adopters will want to abandon old trading venues entirely. Markets that rely on a chain of middlemen to connect them are ripe for a first-mover to take advantage and achieve outside returns.  This technique of cutting out the middlemen is the same technique that led to the rise of electronic exchanges in the 1990s. Then, it provided broker dealers with the opportunity to circumvent the slow and costly operation run by floor traders through electronic venues that could provide information on markets and the ability to change in fractions of a second as opposed to minutes.  Tripartite financing is an example of where cutting out the middleman provides a very large opportunity to capture a market through the building of new networks using blockchain technology. Today, an agent bank mediates between those who have capital and those who need it, through packaging up debt and managing the collateral obligations of the borrower.  With blockchain and smart contracts, which in essence replace financial agreements with autonomous computer code, the role of the intermediary packager becomes redundant. This could lead to large savings for a buy-side firm looking to provide access to capital at a lower cost than its competitor.  Low barriers  In some cases, financial middlemen, even with the advent of blockchain, will still have a role because of the complexity of the service they provide.  Here, those that will win in the market will be those that use the technology to achieve efficiency benefits to provide their service at a lower cost than their competitors.  This advantage will become even more acute in asset classes that tie up a significant amount of capital for a long period of time, such as with leveraged lending, which is a market that involves over $174bn of capital in the US alone. Transactions in this domain involve providing lines of credit to clients that are typically in the hundreds of millions of dollars in notional value.  Having capital sitting on the sidelines for buy-side institutions can be very expensive for financial institutions. In this industry, it is common for settlement to take 30 days.  If blockchain were to reduce the settlement time by a week, this would translate into several hundred thousands of dollars in savings on a $100m notional dollar loan facility.  And if barriers to adopting such a network were low, which they tend to be with blockchain, the buy-side will be quick to vote with their feet. Very quickly, millions of dollars could quickly switch from one agent bank to another just by virtue of having a shorter settlement cycle or lower administration costs.  Time for action  In the high stakes game of 'winner takes all', financial institutions need to formulate a well-thought-out strategy about how they choose to address blockchain. Those that are middlemen will need to use blockchain to become more efficient than their competition or shift business models so that they add value in transactions.  Those with access to capital or financial products have the opportunity to move to a blockchain-enabled network that provides a frictionless mechanism for their clients to access those products.  Financial institutions now have the tools for 'winner take all', the rest is up to them.

42399741,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbybjX,1492160408,Ohio Inmates Found Using Bitcoin in Prison Fraud Bust,"A pair of Ohio prison inmates used bitcoin as part of a cybercrime scheme uncovered last year, according to a newly released report.  The 50-page document, released by Ohio’s Office of the Inspector General this week, outlines a plot in which the two inmates at the Marion Correctional Institution went so far as to maintain two makeshift computers hidden above their cell.  Though details about how they used the digital currency were scarce, a search for clues by state investigators turned up bitcoin wallets on the prison’s computer system, along with other clues indicating an identity fraud plot.  The report explained:  ""[I]t appears the Department Offender Tracking System (DOTS) portal was attacked and inmate passes were created. Findings of bitcoin wallets, [Stripe] accounts, bank accounts and credit card accounts point toward possible identity fraud, along with other possible cybercrimes.""  The two inmates were able to effectively hijack the system by using stolen information from a former corrections employee and computers obtained from a hardware salvage program conducted at the prison.  Who’s to blame? Primarily prison staff, according to the report, who were faulted for not reporting the incident and for failing to properly secure the scene after it was discovered.  Representatives for the prison told CBS News that they had since moved to adopt the recommendations suggested in the report.
