21203205,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=560653,1702079966,What Is USDC?,"Stablecoins like USDC have become a cornerstone in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, offering unique stability and reliability. This article provides an in-depth exploration of the USDC Coin, offering you a detailed understanding of its functions, market dynamics, and the organization behind it, particularly Circle USDC. As you navigate through this guide, you’ll gain insights into the USDC price and its stability, explore whether USDC is fully reserved, and understand its role and impact within the broader crypto ecosystem. What Is USDC? An Overview USDC, or USD Coin, stands as a paradigm of stability in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. It is a type of stablecoin, which means its value is pegged to a stable asset, in this case, the US dollar. This pegging mechanism is designed to combine the flexibility and speed of cryptocurrency transactions with the stability of a fiat currency. USDC operates on several blockchain platforms, including Ethereum and Solana, making it a multi-chain asset. This flexibility allows for broader adoption and integration into various decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and ecosystems. One of the critical features of USDC is its backing by fiat currencies, typically held in reserve by regulated financial institutions. This backing not only provides a level of security but also enhances trust among users, as each USDC token is purportedly equivalent to one US Dollar held in reserve. Moreover, USDC’s adherence to regulatory compliance and transparency standards, particularly in terms of reserve audits, further cements its position as a reliable and trustworthy digital currency in the crypto market. The Basics of USDC In The Crypto World In the dynamic landscape of cryptocurrencies, USDC has carved out a niche as a stablecoin that bridges the traditional financial world with the burgeoning digital economy. Its creation and ongoing management by Circle, in collaboration with Coinbase, reflect a commitment to ensuring that the coin maintains its 1:1 peg to the USD through regular audits and compliance with financial regulations. The utility of USDC extends beyond mere value storage. It is a crucial instrument in various crypto-related activities, including trading, lending, and yield farming, as it provides a stable medium of exchange and value reference. Additionally, USDC’s integration into various blockchain ecosystems has made it a linchpin in the DeFi space, facilitating seamless transactions across different platforms without the typical volatility associated with other cryptocurrencies. As such, USDC is not just a digital version of the dollar; it is a vital tool for financial innovation and digital economy expansion, reflecting the evolving nature of money and finance in the 21st century. The Mechanics Of USDC Stablecoin Understanding the mechanics of USDC is crucial for comprehending its stability and efficiency as a digital currency. In this section, we delve into the technical aspects that govern USDC’s functionality and its practical usage through the USDC contract address. How Does The Stablecoin Function? At first, USDC was an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain, but it has expanded to other blockchains like Solana and Algorand. This interoperability allows for broader utilization across various decentralized platforms. The fundamental principle behind USDC’s functioning is its 1:1 peg to the US Dollar, maintained through a reserve of equivalent fiat currency. This reserve is audited to ensure transparency and trust. The minting and redemption process of USDC is a critical aspect of its mechanics. Users can create USDC by depositing USD into a bank account managed by Circle, the consortium behind USDC. In return, an equivalent amount of USDC is minted and sent to the user’s blockchain address. Conversely, USDC can be ‘burned’ or destroyed to withdraw the equivalent USD, maintaining the stablecoin’s value in parity with the fiat currency. USDC Contract Address The USDC contract address or “USDC Token Address” is a fundamental component of its operation on various blockchains. These addresses represent a unique identifier for the smart contract that governs the USDC token on a specific blockchain. It is through these contract addresses that USDC interacts with the blockchain ecosystem, enabling transactions, minting, and redemption processes. Here are the USDC contract addresses on different blockchains: Ethereum (ERC-20): 0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48 Binance Smart Chain (BSC): 0x8ac76a51cc950d9822d68b83fe1ad97b32cd580d TRON (TRC-20): TEkxiTehnzSmSe2XqrBj4w32RUN966rdz8 Solana: EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v Avalanche: 0xB97EF9Ef8734C71904D8002F8b6Bc66Dd9c48a6E Each blockchain has its unique contract address for USDC, allowing for seamless integration and interoperability across different platforms. These addresses enable the tracking and verification of USDC transactions, ensuring the integrity and transparency of the token across multiple networks. The Organization Behind USDC Coin At the helm of USDC’s development and ongoing operations is Circle, a prominent financial services company specializing in digital currency solutions. In partnership with Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges globally, Circle co-founded the Centre Consortium, which oversees the USDC project. Circle’s role in the USDC ecosystem is multifaceted. It involves overseeing the issuance of USDC, maintaining regulatory compliance, managing reserve assets, and ensuring the stablecoin’s overall integrity and transparency. Circle’s commitment to adhering to stringent regulatory standards, conducting regular audits, and publishing transparency reports has been instrumental in establishing and maintaining trust in USDC among users and regulators alike. Moreover, the collaboration between Circle and Coinbase under the Centre Consortium umbrella is a testament to the synergy between traditional finance and modern fintech innovation. This partnership leverages Circle’s expertise in financial compliance and Coinbase’s robust platform and user base, creating a stablecoin that is widely accessible, highly secure, and seamlessly integrated into the broader cryptocurrency market. Who Owns And Manages USDC? Ownership and management of USDC are structured around the CENTRE Consortium, jointly created by Circle and Coinbase. This structure ensures a balance of power and shared responsibility in managing the stablecoin. While Circle plays a pivotal role in the operational aspects of USDC, including minting, redemption, and ensuring regulatory compliance, Coinbase contributes to its widespread distribution and integration into the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The governance of USDC is designed to be transparent and compliant with existing financial regulations. Regular audits and public reports of the reserve holdings back the stablecoin, providing assurance of its backing and stability. This governance model is part of a broader strategy to maintain user trust and to ensure that USDC remains a stable and reliable digital asset within the volatile cryptocurrency market. USDC Price And Market Dynamics The USDC price is designed for stability, maintaining a 1:1 peg with the US dollar. This stability comes from a corresponding reserve of dollars, contributing to its minimal volatility compared to non-stable cryptocurrencies. However, market dynamics can still influence USDC’s price, albeit in a more constrained manner. Factors such as transaction volume, liquidity in various exchanges, and overall demand for stablecoins can cause slight fluctuations in its value, often reflected in the premium or discount of USDC during high volatility periods in the broader crypto market. These deviations, although typically small, can create opportunities for arbitrage. Arbitrage, in the context of a depegged USDC, involves capitalizing on the price difference between USDC and the actual USD. Traders can buy USDC at a discount (when its value falls slightly below one dollar) and redeem it for a full dollar, or conversely, sell it at a premium (when its value rises above a dollar). This practice, while potentially profitable, requires swift action and a keen understanding of market conditions, as the window for arbitrage is often narrow. Conversion Mechanics The conversion process between USDC and USD is a foundational aspect of its functionality. Users can convert US dollars into USDC by sending USD to the issuer’s bank account, triggering the minting of an equivalent amount of USDC. The reverse process involves ‘burning’ USDC, removing it from circulation, and withdrawing the equivalent amount in USD. This one-to-one exchange mechanism is facilitated by smart contracts on the blockchain, ensuring the transparency and audibility of the stablecoin’s supply. The ease of conversion between USDC and USD underpins the token’s utility as a digital stand-in for the dollar, providing a stable medium for transactions and value storage in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Price Chart And Predictions Despite its stable nature, analyzing USDC’s price charts can offer valuable insights, particularly during depegging events. Such analyses involve observing deviations from its pegged value, which can indicate market stress or changing perceptions about the stability of the stablecoin. While USDC is generally restored to its peg quickly, these fluctuations are closely watched by traders for arbitrage opportunities. Long-term predictions about USDC often focus on its adoption rates, regulatory developments, and the overall growth of the stablecoin market. Observing transaction volumes and patterns also provides indicators of the broader crypto market’s liquidity and stability, informing investment strategies and risk management within the cryptocurrency space. Safety: Is USDC Fully Reserved? The safety and stability of USDC, a major concern for users and investors alike, hinge significantly on whether the stablecoin is fully reserved. To address this, Circle, the issuer of USDC, has implemented robust practices for transparency and accountability. Notably, Circle provides monthly transparency reports. These are crucial in disclosing USDC’s reserve holdings and the associated minting and burning activities of the coin. These reports offer a clear view of the assets backing USDC, ensuring that each token is fully collateralized. The backbone of this transparency lies in the audited consolidated financial statements, confirming that a mix of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and USDC deposits back USDC. This approach aims to maintain a dollar-for-dollar parity, a critical factor for the trust and stability of the stablecoin. In a significant move towards enhanced transparency and trust, Circle announced in January 2023 that it switched its auditing partner from Grant Thornton to Deloitte, one of the ‘Big Four’ accounting firms. This change aligns Circle with Coinbase, which also uses Deloitte for its accounting and audits. Remarkably, the decision to partner with Deloitte for proof of reserves audits represents a step forward in ensuring the highest standards of financial scrutiny and transparency for USDC. Regulatory Insights: SEC Vs. Circle Circle, the issuer of USDC, has actively engaged with the SEC to navigate the evolving regulatory landscape of cryptocurrencies. In July 2021, Circle received an investigative subpoena from the SEC, requesting information about its holdings, customer programs, and operations. Circle has cooperated fully with this investigation, demonstrating its commitment to regulatory compliance​​. Furthermore, Circle has taken a firm stance that stablecoins like USDC should not be classified as securities. In September 2023, during its intervention in the SEC’s case against Binance, Circle argued that payment stablecoins like USDC, tied to assets like the dollar, lack features of an investment contract because their users do not expect profits from standalone purchases. This position suggests that such assets, according to Circle, fall outside the SEC’s jurisdiction, supported by decades of case law that distinguishes asset sales from investment contracts​​. Conclusion: Is USDC Safe? Assessing the safety of USDC involves considering several factors, including its reserve backing, regulatory compliance, and Circle’s proactive engagement with regulatory bodies. The fact that each USDC is backed by a dollar in reserves, verified by regular independent audits, provides a strong foundation for its stability. Circle’s cooperative stance with the SEC and its argument that USDC does not constitute a security further highlight its commitment to compliance and transparency. While no digital asset is entirely risk-free (see below section about historical depegs), these measures position USDC as one of the more reliable and secure stablecoins in the cryptocurrency market. USDC In The Cryptocurrency Market As a key player in the cryptocurrency market, USDC’s role and performance can be best understood in the context of its interaction with other stablecoins and its historical stability, particularly during depeg events. Comparison With Other Stablecoins USDC is often compared with other major stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and Binance USD (BUSD) due to its similar goal of providing stability in the volatile crypto market. While all these stablecoins aim to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar, they differ in their operational approaches, transparency levels, and regulatory compliance. USDC stands out for its strong commitment to regulatory standards and transparent auditing practices, setting it apart from competitors like USDT, which has faced scrutiny over reserve backing. Unlike the “offshore” labeled USDT (Tether), a top-tier firm audits USDC’s operations and reserves, enhancing its credibility and trust. Tether, on the other hand, has drawn criticism for its less transparent reserve audits, not conducted by a ‘Big Four’ audit firm. On the other hand, BUSD, which is a stablecoin issued by Binance in partnership with Paxos, has faced regulatory issues. Binance announced in August 2023 that it will gradually end support for BUSD, following a directive from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to Paxos to halt the minting of new BUSD tokens. USDC Depeg: A Brief History USDC has a strong track record of maintaining its peg to the USD, but it has faced moments of depegging. A notable instance occurred during the banking turmoil involving Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in March 2023. Circle disclosed that it had $3.3 billion of its reserves in SVB. Amid fears of a banking crisis, USDC’s price on exchanges like Kraken plunged to 87 cents, a significant deviation from its $1 peg. This event led to a surge in trading volumes as market participants rushed to arbitrage opportunities, and decentralized exchanges saw record-high volumes. Circle swiftly addressed the situation by removing about 3.9 billion USDC from circulation, exceeding the amount minted, and confirmed the transfer of its reserves to BNY Mellon. Subsequently, USDC regained its peg, highlighting its resilience despite the temporary depeg caused by external banking pressures​. Use Cases For The Stablecoin USDC’s versatile nature enables its use in a variety of financial activities, ranging from straightforward buying and selling to more complex applications like staking, earning interest, and participating in lending and borrowing schemes. Buying, Staking And Earning Interest Users can stake USDC by locking up their tokens to support a blockchain network’s operation, earning interest in return. Additionally, many platforms offer interest-earning accounts where depositing USDC can yield returns, similar to a traditional savings account but often at higher rates. Notably, the interest rates vary greatly depending on the platform. The rate can be an indication of how risky the provider’s practices are in order to earn the interest. You should always read the terms and conditions in detail to understand what is happening with your money. Borrowing, Lending And Practical Uses In decentralized finance (DeFi), many use USDC for borrowing and lending. Users can lend their USDC to earn interest or use it as collateral to borrow other assets. This flexibility makes USDC a valuable tool for liquidity and risk management in the crypto ecosystem. Here, too, you should understand the risks of the respective products before you invest. How To Buy USDC? Buying USDC typically involves registering on a crypto exchange or platform that supports USDC trading. Users can purchase USDC using fiat currencies like USD or exchange it for other cryptocurrencies. The process involves creating an account, completing any required KYC procedures, and then executing the purchase through the platform’s trading interface. The Future Of USDC USDC’s future is taking shape with its growing role beyond traditional cryptocurrency trading and speculation, as it ventures into global payments, decentralized finance (DeFi), and the emerging metaverse. Growth and Future Projections for USDC Several emerging use cases could drive USDC’s growth: Mainstream Cross-Border Payments: USDC could revolutionize mainstream e-commerce and B2B payments across borders. Its advantages over traditional bank wires, demonstrated by partnerships like Visa’s with Circle, highlight its potential in real-world commerce​​. Financial Inclusion: USDC presents opportunities for expanding financial inclusion, particularly for the unbanked and underbanked. It offers an accessible digital payment infrastructure that bridges geographic and cost barriers, potentially transforming access to financial services worldwide​​. DeFi Ecosystem: In the DeFi space, USDC is a popular choice due to its price stability. The stablecoin sees widespread use for loans, borrowing, and yield farming on DeFi lending platforms. Moreover, decentralized exchanges use USDC as a base pair for trading. NFT Market: The rise of NFTs has seen USDC emerge as a preferred medium for transactions. It’s offering a more affordable way to purchase NFTs compared to high gas fees associated with other cryptocurrencies​​. Metaverse Economies: As virtual worlds in the metaverse evolve, USDC is becoming an important digital currency for in-world transactions, offering price stability for buying virtual goods and services​. Innovations And Developments In The Ecosystem USDC stands ready for continuous innovation, potentially expanding its blockchain integration and developing new features to meet user needs. Its role in facilitating more equitable financial services and its integration into evolving digital economies positions USDC as a significant player in the future of digital currency and global finance.

The NDAA details the military budget for the upcoming year, though as one of the U.S.'s few must-pass bills, it's often amended with various other provisions.  Senate amendments included one for the Secretary of the Treasury ""to establish a risk-focused examination and review process for financial institutions"" to look at whether reporting obligations for crypto assets under money-laundering rules were adequate and whether firms were compliant.  The other would direct the Treasury Department to produce and publish a report on the use of mixers and tumblers, the magnitude of transactions using privacy tools, the extent to which sanctioned entities might be using those tools and more.  It would also direct the Treasury to come up with ""recommendations for legislation or regulation relating to the technologies and services described.""

21200268,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=564657,1702072815,2 Reasons Why An Ethereum Mega Bull Run Is Inevitable,"While the recent Bitcoin and crypto momentum is cooling off, Ethereum (ETH) rejects lower lows, especially against Bitcoin (BTC). Taking to X on December 8, decentralized finance (DeFi) researcher DefiIgnas shared insights that suggest ETH could be on the verge of a rally that would potentially see the second most valuable coin usurp BTC’s current position as the best-performing asset. Reasons That Might Drive Ethereum Bulls The researcher observed that ETH is down 24% versus BTC in 2023. However, multiple fundamental indicators show that this is about to change. First, DefiIgnas noted that crypto investors are increasingly drawn to discounted Grayscale Ethereum Trust (GETH), which has been rallying over the past few months, outperforming Ethereum spot prices. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Remains Strong and Eyes Fresh Surge Above $44K GETH surged by 298% in the past few months, while ETH only rose by around 100% in the same period. As GETH share prices increased, its discount with spot ETH decreased. This means more capital indirectly flowed into ETH, leading to higher demand. Besides GETH rising, the researcher remains bullish on Ethereum because of the recent developments surrounding the approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETF. The crypto community expects the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to authorize multiple products, including those proposed by Fidelity and BlackRock. In DefiIgnas’ assessment, once the spot Bitcoin ETF goes live, likely in early 2024, all “attention, narrative, and speculation” will shift toward the agency approving the first spot Ethereum ETF. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has already applied with the SEC to issue the first spot Ethereum ETF. The expected activation of the Cancun upgrade in H1 2024 will also likely support Ethereum prices. Over the years, Ethereum has integrated multiple upgrades. This includes shifting to proof-of-stake (PoS) from proof-of-work (PoW) and overhauling their fee auction mechanism, introducing ETH burning. Related Reading: Liquidation Quandary: Litecoin Wallets Draining Fast – What’s Next For LTC Prices? However, with Cancun, the goal is to directly enhance the main net’s capabilities by activating several proposals, including EIP-4844 proto-dank sharding, which aims to reduce gas fees associated with rollups. This update will further cement Ethereum’s quest to significantly increase on-chain scalability and reduce gas fees over the years. ETH Looks Firm, Resistance At November Highs At spot rates, ETH is firm versus BTC, looking at the candlestick arrangement in the daily chart. How prices react in the days ahead remains to be seen. Even so, if there is confirmation of the December 7 gains, ETH might extend gains. In that case, it can break above the current consolidation as bulls aim to break above November 2023 highs of around 0.058 BTC.

In a recent analysis, VanEck forecasts a substantial inflow of funds into Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), expecting more than $2.4 billion to be injected in the first quarter of 2024 alone. This bullish prediction aligns with the anticipated launch of the first Bitcoin spot ETF in the US, which could positively change the crypto landscape. Related Reading: Holding For Gold: Micheal Saylor’s Poll Unveils Bitcoin Enthusiasts Aiming For $1 Million Mark Bitcoin Bullish Forecast This forecast emerges against a backdrop where investors are increasingly gravitating towards ‘hard money’ assets, those which remain largely unaffected by the whims of US authorities, as indicated by VanEck In this context, Bitcoin emerges as a particularly appealing option due to its “resilience” and limited correlation with conventional financial markets. Despite the expected market volatility, VanEck’s analysts maintain strong confidence in Bitcoin’s market stance, projecting that its price will unlikely fall below the $30,000 mark in early 2024. VanEck’s report delves further into Bitcoin’s future, highlighting the significance of the upcoming Bitcoin halving in April 2024. This event is anticipated to “proceed without a major fork or missed blocks” catalyzing a surge in Bitcoin’s value. Unsurprisingly, the firm predicts that November 9, 2024, could witness Bitcoin attaining a new all-time high three years after its last peak. VanEck added that such a milestone could even see Bitcoin’s mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, being named Time Magazine’s “Man of the Year,” particularly if Bitcoin reaches the $100,000 threshold.

Over $2.4B may flow into these ETFs in Q1 2024 to support Bitcoin’s price. — VanEck (@vaneck_us) December 7, 2023 Ethereum And Solana’s Rising Tide: VanEck’s Perspective On Altcoin Market Dynamics In contrast to Bitcoin’s expected dominance, VanEck casts a different light on Ethereum’s future. The firm anticipates that while Ethereum will not surpass Bitcoin in market cap in 2024, it is likely to outperform every major tech stock. However, Ethereum is projected to face challenges from other smart contract platforms like Solana, which present fewer uncertainties regarding scalability. VanEck’s analysis suggests that while Ethereum will show strong performance, it will lose market share to these emerging platforms. The report also touches upon geopolitical implications for Bitcoin. Countries like Argentina are expected to follow El Salvador’s lead by sponsoring state-level Bitcoin mining and leveraging their energy resources. This trend, combined with Bitcoin’s regulatory clarity and energy intensity, is predicted to draw attention from quasi-state entities in Latin America, the Middle East, and Asia. According to VanEck’s insights, the post-halving period will see a market rally led by Bitcoin, with value eventually flowing into smaller tokens. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Bullish Leap: Trading Guru John Bollinger Weighs In On BTC Ongoing Rally Lastly, VanEck casts a spotlight on Solana, predicting its rise to become a top-three blockchain by market cap, Total Value Locked (TVL), and active users.

42391797,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfwJ0H,1702067558,Jito's Token Launch Pushed Competitor Marinade's MNDE to All-Time Highs,"Jito's successful JTO token launch is lifting many ships in the Solana [SOL] ecosystem, including that of a direct competitor: Marinade.  Marinade, which like Jito issues a liquid staking token (LST) for SOL investors, saw its governance token reach all-time highs this week. The brisk rally – MNDE doubled to $0.50 in a matter of hours – came as Jito's own JTO token launched and rallied, too.  Marinade now has a fully diluted valuation of $500 million compared to Jito's valuation of $3.5 billion. This is in spite of Jito being a smaller business: Its total value locked (a measurement of the size of a crypto project) is $460 million, whereas Marinade has a TVL of $737 million.  The seeming contradiction caused consternation in Marinade's community Discord server, where some investors speculated on why MNDE fell behind JTO. Both assets are governance tokens whose holders have sway over decisions like the fee rates and treasury of their respective LST protocols.  ""Jito has the added benefit of its block building engine and MEV infrastructure,"" said Barrett Williams, founder of Solana-based futures trading venue Cypher, explaining why investors put a premium on the smaller protocol.  Still, the Thursday airdrop of JTO indirectly spread wealth to MNDE holders, too, by prompting the entire market to reevaluate how it was pricing the Marinade protocol, said Ally Zach, a research analyst for Messari.  ""Investors were probably speculating that they will be valued similarly over time,"" she said in a Telegram message.  The psychology of free money airdrop also might have been a factor. Jito distributed at least 4,900 JTO tokens to around 10,000 wallets apiece, ""which left a lot of people on the sidelines,"" she said. The token's post-launch surge put a spotlight on this corner of Solana, and then ""a lot of these sideliners probably came in and started buying.""  Marinade and Jito have both drawn comparisons to Lido [LDO], the best-known and, by far, the largest LST protocol in crypto. Lido has commanded most LST activity on Ethereum [ETH] but struggled to replicate that success on Solana. In mid-October, right at the start of the recent Solana rally, it quit the ecosystem. This left a wider opening for Marinade and Jito, both of which started on and stuck with Solana.  The repricing and market mechanics may also have to do with liquidity – or lack of it, said InfraRAY, head of partnerships for Solana-based DEX Raydium. There's only so many JTO tokens in circulation after Thursday's airdrop. Even though 95% of the current distribution has been claimed – and is therefore circulating – it's still only a fraction of the JTO's total supply. Fewer tokens floating around means fewer available to buy or sell.

Chainlink Funding Rate On Binance Has Turned Highly Positive According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the Chainlink funding rate on Binance has now reached the highest level in about four weeks. The “funding rate” refers to the periodic fee that derivative traders on any given platform are exchanging with each other right now. When the value of this metric is positive, it means that the long holders are currently paying a fee to the short investors in order to hold onto their positions. Such a trend suggests a bullish mentality is dominant on the platform. Related Reading: 63.2% Of PEPE Holders Now In Profit: How This Compares With DOGE, SHIB On the other hand, negative values imply a bearish sentiment is shared by most LINK traders on the exchange as the shorts outweigh the longs. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Chainlink funding rate on cryptocurrency exchange Binance over the last few months: The value of the metric appears to have seen a large spike recently | Source: Santiment on X As displayed in the above graph, the Chainlink funding rate on Binance has assumed significantly positive values following the asset’s surge beyond the $16 mark. Longs currently outweigh the shorts by the highest ratio since November 11th, when the cryptocurrency’s price set its then-yearly high, which the coin has now surpassed. Historically, longs piling up on the derivatives market have often been negative for the price. This is because a mass liquidation event called a “squeeze” is usually more likely to affect the side with the most positions. In a squeeze, a sudden swing in the price triggers a large amount of liquidations, which only feed into the swing further and end up leading to a cascade of more liquidations. As the Chainlink funding rate is significantly positive, a long squeeze could be more likely to happen than a short squeeze. Last month, the asset hit its local top in these conditions, so the same might also repeat this time. If LINK does observe a drawdown shortly, though, the decline may not be too extended. This is because there appears to be some strong on-chain support present between the $14.4 and $14.8, as analyst Ali pointed out in an X post yesterday. Looks like LINK has little resistance ahead | Source: @ali_charts on X In on-chain analysis, levels are defined as resistance and support based on the total number of investors who acquired their coins at said levels. From the chart, it’s visible that 17,000 addresses have their cost basis inside the $14.4 to $14.8 range, which means it’s possibly a zone of strong support. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Driving The Rally Are Now Taking Profits, Data Suggests On the contrary, the levels above the current one are thin with investors, meaning that they shouldn’t pose too much resistance should the rally continue. “As $LINK has regained the $16 threshold, watch if a bit of FOMO forms a local top, or if prices continue surging toward $20 with little resistance,” notes Santiment. LINK Price LINK had earlier broken past the $17 mark, but the asset has since seen some pullback as it’s now trading under the level once more.

Bitcoin may revisit $40,000 to ""fill CME price gap,"" crypto analyst Willy Woo speculated.  Native tokens tied to layer 1 (L1) blockchains gained the most Friday, with Cardano [ADA] being the best performer, as steady bitcoin [BTC] price fueled capital rotation to altcoins.  Bitcoin bounced between $43,000 and $44,000 during the day, quickly shaking off a minor dip following a stronger U.S. employment report than analysts expected that dampened interest rate cut expectations for next year.  The top crypto was recently trading at around $43,800, consolidating as investors digested its swift rally to near $45,000 this week after its breakout from $38,000 a week ago.  Altcoins, meanwhile, jumped across the board, resembling early November's ""altcoin rotation"" when slowing bitcoin momentum drove traders to realize some gains and invest in smaller, riskier cryptocurrencies. These capital rotations are typical in the crypto markets after large bitcoin run-ups, followed by a rally in bigger crypto assets then among meme coins and micro caps as traders chase tokens that haven't moved yet to profit.  ADA surged 25% to 57 cents at one point during the day, its highest price since August 2022. It gave up some of the early gains later in the day, but was still up almost 20% today. Other notable top performers were native tokens of Polkadot [DOT], Algorand [ALGO], Avalanche [AVAX] and Solana [SOL], which posted 7%-11% gains.  The CoinDesk Market Index [CMI], a basket of almost 200 cryptocurrencies, was up 1.5% through the day, more than BTC, underscoring altcoin outperformance.  What's next for BTC  As bitcoin's momentum stalled, some analysts speculated about a potential pullback to retest lower price levels.  Bitcoin-focused analyst Willy Woo eyed a price level between $39,000-$41,000 based on a price gap in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) bitcoin futures market, which BTC might ""fill"" sometime in the future.  These price gaps occur because the CME futures market, unlike native crypto exchanges like Binance or Deribit, don't trade around the clock, and there could be a difference between closing and opening prices depending on bitcoin's price action when the market is closed. Some analysts reckon that asset prices tend to revisit these levels during a correction, filling the gap.  BTC rallied last weekend surpassing $40,000, when the CME futures market was closed, creating the price gap on the chart.  ""By my count 28 out of 30 gaps have been filled on CME daily candles (93%),"" Woo posted on X, formerly Twitter.  However, these gaps do not always get filled. For example, BTC hasn't revisited the CME gap at around $20,000 yet, formed in March during the weekend collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB).  Institutional inflows to bitcoin are ""underappreciated""  Despite a potential short-term pullback, bitcoin's outlook is bullish, with growing interest among institutional investors, Hany Rashwan, co-founder and CEO of digital asset management firm 21.co, said in a Friday interview with CoinDesk TV.  Rashwan opined that market observers are ""underappreciating"" future inflows into BTC if – or once – a spot-based exchange-traded fund gets approved in the U.S, which will likely happen according to analysts.  ""There are a lot of [prospective] buyers, who for various reasons wanted to invest in crypto but has been prohibited to do so"" because of regulations, he said. Rashwan noted that 75% of inflows into digital asset funds during the year happened in the past 60-90 days. ""That's not normal,"" he said, adding that it's ""a sign of change in sentiment across primarily institutional players.""  Read more: Crypto Funds Attract Largest Weekly Inflow in 2023 as Bitcoin 'Short-Sellers Capitulate'  Rashwan prognosed all-time high prices for bitcoin, but not in the short term.

21195857,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=564580,1702062004,Dogecoin Above $0.1? Crypto Analyst Lists Reasons Why DOGE Price Will Continue To Rally,"Dogecoin (DOGE) has been up close to 75% in the last 45 days and if one analyst’s projection is anything to go by, this rally isn’t coming to an end anytime soon. This comes at a time when many are hoping that DOGE can hit the $0.10 mark and possibly reach new highs. Why DOGE’s Future Is Bullish In a video posted on his YouTube Channel, crypto analyst Austin Hilton highlighted Dogecoin’s significant gain in the last 45 days and discussed the future trajectory of the meme coin. Austin sounded so bullish on DOGE as he gave reasons why he believes this rally will continue. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Team Unveils Enhanced SHIB And BONE Burns, What This Means Firstly, he alluded to the fact that the crypto market as a whole was currently enjoying an upward trend as liquidity was flowing into the ecosystem. He noted that Bitcoin and other major altcoins have picked up as a result of this. DOGE hasn’t been left behind, as the meme coin is also riding this wave. With this in mind, he believes that Dogecoin will continue to rise as more liquidity is expected to flow into altcoins like the meme coin. He attributed these inflows to the bullishness around Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which many expect the SEC to approve in January. The second reason why he is bullish on DOGE’s future is based on his assertion that December happens to be “very, very good” for crypto. As such, he doesn’t expect this December to be any different. So far, this month has undoubtedly been good for the crypto market, and this momentum is likely to continue as many position themselves ahead of January. DOGE price recovers toward $0.1 | Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview.com Dogecoin Also Looking Good On The Charts Several crypto analysts have also weighed in on DOGE’s future trajectory from a technical analysis perspective. Based on their projections, the meme coin could end the year on a high and possibly enjoy similar gains to the one it enjoyed in 2021. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale With Over $60 Million In Unrealized Profits Moves Coins To Exchange Specifically, crypto analyst JD recently noted that Dogecoin’s MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) was on the verge of having another bullish cross. The last time this happened was in 2021, which led to the meme coin seeing a 370x gain in its price. Based on the chart that JD shared, this bullish cross could happen again in 2024. Based on another crypto analyst’s projections, Dogecoin could gain over 900% in a move that will see it rise to $0.7, And 2024 is also predicted to be the year that this could happen. The fundamentals also complement these technical analyses as there are plans in place to send DOGE to the moon (and up the charts). At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.09, up by over 1.50%, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

According to an expert, the cryptocurrency has been breaching every major obstacle, making it one of the best-performing assets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Dips To $43,200: Buy Or Sell Now? Analyst Predicts Trend As of this writing, Bitcoin (BTC) trades at $43,600 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours. Over the previous seven days, BTC recorded a 14% increase, with Ethereum following its footsteps, recording a 13% rally. Bitcoin vs. Gold: The Digital Currency’s Journey to $40,000 Jurrien Timmer, Director of Macro for Fidelity, offers insightful analysis of Bitcoin’s trajectory, likening it to “exponential gold.” His thesis suggests that Bitcoin, much like its elder counterpart, gold, holds value in times of structural inflation, yet it boasts an added venture twist. In that sense, Timmer believes both assets are prime to capture attention from investors looking to protect themselves from “reckless monetary inflation.” As seen in the chart below, if Bitcoin follows a similar trajectory to the previous, its price could target $100,000 and $1,000,000 by early 2025. 2020 was pivotal for Bitcoin and gold, with fiscal and monetary stimulus bolstering their appeal. However, Bitcoin differentiates itself with its capped supply of 21 million coins, contrasting gold’s continual but modest annual supply growth. This limited supply has propelled Bitcoin’s “stock-to-flow” (S2F) ratio significantly higher than gold’s. Moreover, Bitcoin’s journey reflects the classic S-curve path of technological innovations. Its exponential growth trajectory mirrors historical trends in technology from railroads to cell phones. However, predicting Bitcoin’s future based on these S-curves is complex, as slight deviations in these growth phases can “dramatically” alter outcomes, the expert claims. SEC Deliberations And Institutional Interest Shape Bitcoin’s Future Timmer’s observations include a potential impact of the SEC’s anticipated decisions on the Bitcoin spot Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). He theorizes that pending product applications could attract new investors, yet he remains cautious about whether this will trigger a “sell-the-news” event and a large drawdown. Interestingly, a small percentage of Bitcoin is held for under three months, suggesting that the recent price surge is not merely “speculative,” offering support for a longer bullish trend. The true believers in Bitcoin, as indicated by the growing percentage held for over five or ten years, are unlikely to be swayed by short-term news. However, there is notable activity in the Bitcoin futures market, particularly among asset managers, which could suggest anticipation of the SEC movement. Any updates from the SEC would arrive in a transformed macroeconomic environment. Unlike the liquidity-rich period of 2020-21, the US Federal Reserve’s (Fed) recent policy shifts have reversed the surge in monetary inflation. This shift aligns the current situation more with the post-World War II era than the inflationary 1970s, impacting the urgency of the value proposition for gold and Bitcoin.

Former Binance CEO No Longer Leaving The US The Binance co-founder has been ordered by US District Judge Richard Jones to remain in the country in a ruling on Thursday. Zhao was instructed to stay in the US due to the significance of his recent guilty plea. The ruling read: As relief, the government requests that Mr. Zhao be required to remain in the continental United States in the period between his plea and sentencing. The Thursday ruling reversed an earlier decision that would have allowed Zhao to return to the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Jones acknowledged in his decision the arguments provided by Zhao, which ordinarily would result in the government’s motion being denied. Related Reading: Crypto Market Reacts: Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao Steps Down However, Jones highlighted the distinctive features of Zhao’s case. These include his riches, the absence of an extradition treaty with the UAE, and Zhao’s family living in the UAE. Furthermore, the judge also highlighted that Zhao poses a flight risk if he were allowed to return to the UAE. This is due to the former CEO’s substantial assets and the meager connections he has to the United States. Additionally, knowing that the Binance ex-CEO faces a potential 18-month sentence in prison also sparks a possible flight risk. Jones asserted that Zhao is asking for a lesser sentence, which might lead to 18 months of incarceration as indicated by the government. The judge stated that despite promises that CZ wouldn’t flee if permitted to travel to the UAE, the court wasn’t convinced. This led to the order that he should remain in the US until his sentencing on February 23, 2024. So far, the court stated in the ruling that its decision is not based on Zhao’s citizenship and alienage. “The risk of the defendant not showing up is posed by the circumstances surrounding their combined facts,” the court said. Changpeng “CZ” Zhao’s Guilty Plea Last Month, the former Binance CEO pleaded guilty and stepped down from the cryptocurrency exchange he founded about 6 years ago. Zhao’s plea to one count of violating the Bank Secrecy Act was formally accepted by Judge Jones. Related Reading: Binance Compliance Officer Under Scrutiny For FTX, Gemini, And Sex Trafficker Associations Jones accepted the plea after a thorough consideration report and recommendation of the United States Magistrate Judge which found him guilty. Jones wrote: This Court, having considered the Report and Recommendation of the United States Magistrate Judge, to which there has been no timely objection, hereby accepts the plea of guilty of the defendant. His plea was accepted just over two weeks after both he and Binance acknowledged a number of criminal and civil charges. These include failure to maintain an appropriate anti-money laundering program, running an unlicensed money transfer business, and violation of sanctions law.

Overall, the expanded staking pool capacity is 45 million LINK, up from 25 million under v0.1, a figure that includes the community pool allocation as well as a separate node operator pool.  According to a Chainlink spokesman, there are currently 1.8 million LINK in the node operator pool, out of a capacity of 4.125 million.  Some 21.9 million LINK migrated over from the earlier version of the staking program.  Staking is part of what the company calls Economics 2.0 that is meant to help secure the Chainlink system.  Chainlink staking enables node operators - which help engineers fetch external data - and community members to support the performance of oracle services with staked LINK. People can also earn rewards.  ""Staking v0.2 introduces important new security features and sets the system up for even further growth in the year to come,"" Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov said in a press release.

21191224,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=564526,1702051239,XRP Price To Go Parabolic? Crypto Analyst Confirms 1000% Golden Cross Has Returned,"The XRP price is still underperforming the general crypto market raising concerns among holders. However, it is not all bad for the cryptocurrency which boasts of one of the strongest communities in the sector. As for its price, the optimism toward a recovery remains high as crypto analyst JD has given a rather bullish prediction for the altcoin’s price. XRP Price Confirms Golden Cross Fo 1000% Rally In his latest analysis of the XRP price, crypto analyst JD has pointed out a bullish formation that could bode very good news for the altcoin. According to him, the cryptocurrency has confirmed a rare Golden Cross on its 4-day chart, and historical performance points to an at least 700% increase following this. Related Reading: Crypto Pundit Reveals Why Bitcoin Is Worth As Much As $17 Million JD’s chart shows what happened the last two times that the XRP price confirmed such a Golden Cross. The first was back in 2017 when the asset’s price completed the Golden Cross after a four-year trendline breakout. Following this, the XRP price would go on to rise 700% in short succession. Source: X The next time that the Golden Cross appeared on the chart was back in 2020 just as the bull market was starting. This time around, there was a 1000% surge in the XRP price after this pattern was confirmed, mounting an even bigger rally than the previous occurrence. If the XRP price sticks to this historical performance, then there could be an 800% increase, on average, for the price of the coin. However, if it also follows the trend of the most recent surge being higher than the last, the token could be looking at a more than 1000% increase, which would put its price above $6. XRP locks above $0.64 | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com Beware The Pullback Before The Rally While JD’s analysis paints an incredibly bullish picture for the XRP price, the analyst also warns of a pullback in the price before the rally. Both times that the Golden Cross has appeared, the token’s price has seen a pullback before confirming the breakout. Related Reading: Bitcoin Pushes Into Extreme Greed, What You Should Expect From Here In 2017, there was a 64% price correction before the 700% surge. Then again in 2020 when the Golden Cross appeared, there was a 40% price correction before the price rallied 1000%. So it stands to reason that there will be a pullback this time around before a rally begins. Currently, XRP bulls seem to be waking up once again after a brief period of consolidation. The price broke out above $0.64 on Thursday, and the bullish trend is expected to continue as Bitcoin and the crypto market recovers.

Here’s how this compares against DOGE, SHIB, and other memecoins. PEPE Has Recently Woken Up With Fresh Rally And On-Chain Activity According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, PEPE’s latest price surge of over 37% during the past week has meant that its holder profitability ratio has observed a significant jump. Related Reading: Cardano Could See 70% Rally To $0.75, Analyst Predicts When The below chart shows how the percentage of the holders carrying some unrealized profit has changed for PEPE during the last few months and also how the same metric compares for the other meme coins in the sector like DOGE and SHIB. The value of the metric appears to have shot up for PEPE in recent days | Source: IntoTheBlock on X Following this surge, around 63.2% of PEPE’s user base is holding their coins with positive returns. As is visible from the chart, the frog-based memecoin’s profitability ratio is now the second highest among these assets, above the likes of Shiba Inu and Floki. Dogecoin still remains the top meme coin based on this metric, however, as more than 70% of its investors are in the green. The indicator’s recent surge has been slower for DOGE, though, so if PEPE can keep up its rise, it might overtake the original meme-based token. The profitability ratio isn’t the only indicator that has improved for the cryptocurrency recently, as IntoTheBlock notes, its active addresses have also registered a rapid increase. Looks like the indicator's value has seen a sharp surge | Source: IntoTheBlock on X The “active addresses” refer to those addresses that are taking part in some sort of transaction activity on the blockchain, whether as a receiver or sender. From the above graph, it’s apparent that the total number of active addresses has shot up for PEPE recently, a sign that investors have become quite active. A high amount of users participating on the network is usually a positive sign for a rally’s sustainability, as it means that it might be able to keep itself fueled for longer. It’s usually a worrying sign when rallies take place, but activity drops instead. It’s not the case for this surge of the meme coin, of course, as user interest in the cryptocurrency has appeared to be high. It’s not just the regular investors that are showing interest in the asset, either, as the large transactions on the network have also observed significant growth recently. The number of large transactions on the blockchain have also seen an uplift | Source: IntoTheBlock The large transactions refer to those transfers that are carrying at least $100,000 in value. Not too long ago, there were just 10 such large daily transactions happening for the memecoin, but now the count has grown to more than 160. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Driving The Rally Are Now Taking Profits, Data Suggests Typically, such transactions are a sign of movement from the whales, so the indicator going up for PEPE suggests that these humongous entities also have an active interest in trading the coin currently.

21188292,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=564557,1702044029,"Ethereum Price Soars To Over $2,300 – Is $3,000 Next?","The market performance of Ethereum has been steadily rising since October, marking a positive and long-lasting trend. Increased buying activity has been the main driver of this positive momentum that has persisted over time, pushing the cryptocurrency beyond the vaunted $2,000 resistance mark and igniting a continuing rally. The value of Ethereum has sharply grown as a direct result of this increased demand and market optimism, with its sights set on breaking through the crucial resistance region at $2,300. This upward trend serves as another evidence of the increasing investor trust and general bullishness surrounding Ethereum, thereby solidifying its place in the changing cryptocurrency market. Related Reading: This BRC-20 Token Just Breached $1 Billion Market Cap With 180% Rally Today – Details Ethereum Hits 18-Month Highs, Targets $3,000 Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world, is rising quickly and has reached levels not seen in the previous 18 months. With a market valuation of $285 billion, ETH is now trading 5.7% higher at $2,375 as of the time of publication. Some speculators have even shared $3,000 price predictions for ETH amid the latest market breakout. Ethereum’s approaching resistance level poses a huge challenge to buyers of the altcoin, including the fixed barrier at $2.5K, which has frequently shown to be a significant roadblock. But if the market is able to recapture this critical area, Ethereum may go on to reach the $2.5K – or even $3.000 — in the future. Ethereum currently trading at $2,358 territory on the daily chart: TradingView.com As Ethereum breaks down further obstacles, investors and market watchers are keeping a close eye on the situation. A notable indication of the increased interest from institutional investors is the eagerness with which major players like VanEck, BlackRock, and Grayscale are awaiting clearance for Spot Ethereum ETFs. According to Santiment, an on-chain data service, Ethereum has reached $2,349, its highest price since June 2022. The amalgamation of the positive long-term trend indicating a rise in wealth for the leading non-exchange whale wallets and a decrease in sell-off power for the leading exchange whale wallets presents a propitious situation for a steady upward trend. Ethereum’s Non-Exchange Holdings Surge To 55M ETH A recent tweet from Santinment highlights some intriguing variations in Ethereum’s wallet mechanics. Exchange wallets saw a five-year low of 9.3 million ETH, while top non-exchange wallets are building up to a record 54.6 million ETH. This move points to upward trends, with wealth building through non-exchange transactions and decreased selling pressure. Related Reading: XRP Greed Index Soars, Backed By Robust $1.3 Billion Volume – Good For Price? Over the course of two months, a bearish divergence between the price and the RSI indicator grew, pointing to a possible overvaluation of Ethereum at this point. Given the current characteristics of the market, even if buyers seem to be in charge and overall sentiment is bullish, there is a significant likelihood of a brief corrective phase that involves consolidation and higher volatility in the near future. Meanwhile, a recent ACDE meeting provided information about the impending Dencun fork of Ethereum, which is set to occur in January 2024. The Goerli network testnet fork was well-prepared for by development teams, opening the door for a larger Goerli shadow network fork in the coming weeks. ACDE#176 happened earlier today: we discussed the state of Dencun, timelines for testnets, and how to approach planning the following network upgrade ⛓️ Agenda: https://t.co/ATVLQ7f9Xp Stream: https://t.co/tDM0tDKxC5 Recap below 👇 https://t.co/PhGBkYxhYN — timbeiko.eth ☀️ (@TimBeiko) December 7, 2023 By using proto-danksharding, Dencun is expected to greatly increase data availability for layer-2 rollups. This improvement should result in lower rollup transaction costs, which will eventually help end customers. Dencun’s overall effects include rollups that increase Ethereum’s scalability, gas fee optimization, improved network security, and the deployment of several housekeeping upgrades. As Ethereum’s price surges to surpass the $2,300 milestone, speculation intensifies about the cryptocurrency’s potential to reach the next significant threshold of $3,000. The recent upward trajectory reflects the market’s confidence in Ethereum’s underlying technology and its role in the evolving digital landscape.

42391812,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfwKFD,1702040460,First Mover Americas: Binance Withdraws an Abu Dhabi License Application,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Cryptocurrency exchange Binance withdrew its bid for an investment-management license in Abu Dhabi, deeming it unnecessary to the company's ""global needs."" The exchange still has an application to offer custody of digital assets to professional clients. ""When assessing our global licensing needs, we decided this application was not necessary,"" a Binance spokesperson said in an emailed statement. Binance is licensed in Dubai, and that is the company's Middle East and North Africa headquarters, CEO Richard Teng said in an interview for a Financial Times conference on Tuesday. The decision is unrelated to the exchange's legal settlement in the U.S., where it agreed to pay a $4.3 billion fine for violating anti-money laundering and money transmitter rules.  El Salvador is targeting bitcoin (BTC) and crypto millionaires in its latest push to attract long-term residents to the country. The nation kickstarted its ""Freedom VISA"" program on Thursday, doling out residency to a maximum of 1,000 people per year who invest at least $1 million worth of bitcoin or tether (USDT) stablecoins. Eligible participants receive a long-term residency permit and have a path to full citizenship. An application costs a non-refundable $999 in BTC or USDT, and the process is live as of Friday.  Popular U.S.-based brokerage platform Robinhood (HOOD) on Thursday started letting customers in the European Union (EU) trade crypto, hailing the region's comprehensive digital asset rules. To spur customers to use the service, Robinhood will credit a percentage of their trading volume back every month, paid in bitcoin (BTC), according to a Thursday blog post. And users can earn more BTC for referring new customers. This expansion debuts as cryptocurrencies have been rallying after a brutal bear market, recovering to a $1.5 trillion total market capitalization, the highest level since May 2022. Rising trading volumes also mean more revenue for trading platforms.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows LINK's funding rate or cost of holding tether or USD-margined long (buy)/short (sell) positions in the perpetual futures market.  The funding rate has surged to its highest since at least June, indicating a bias for long positions. The token has more than doubled to $16.3 since mid-October.  Deeply negative or positive funding rates often act as a precursor to trend reversals.

21186878,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=564525,1702040438,"Analyst Says Bitcoin Just Broke A Bullish Megaphone Pattern, What Are The Implications?","Bitcoin continues to maintain its bullish momentum even after some corrections following the breach above $44,000. Despite rising almost $15,000 in 30 days, the bullish sentiment has still not waned, especially among crypto analysts, who continue to expect more bullish strides from the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Breaks Bullish Megaphone Pattern In a new analysis, crypto analyst TradingShot has referred to a peculiar pattern that the Bitcoin price has broken. According to the analyst, the crypto broke above a very bullish megaphone pattern, something that has been keeping the price muted for a while now. Related Reading: Bitcoin Shakeout Drives $190 Million In Losses For Over 81,000 Traders As TradingShot explains, this megaphone pattern is important because it has been the pattern that has held Bitcoin back since it first made a local high on October 24. So a break out of this pattern is understandably very bullish for the price. Source: Tradingview.com “The previous Bullish Megaphone of September – October technically served as a consolidation belt before the price broke upwards to deliver a +31.86% peak from the Megaphone’s last Higher Low and +40.50% from its first Low,” TradingShot said. Breaking out of the megaphone pattern suggests that there is more upside to come. If it goes as expected, then the crypto analyst believes that the BTC price could still make another move toward the $48,000 price target. A Likely Path For BTC Price The next stop for Bitcoin now would be to clear the $45,000 resistance which has remained elusive. However, this may soon be a problem of the past going by TradingShot’s analysis which suggests a breakout is on the horizon. “The ROC shows a similar behavioral structure between the two patterns. If it continues this way, then a new +31.50% leg will make a perfect contact on 48220, which is the March 28 2022 High,” the crypto analyst explained. They further add that this is “essentially the Bear Cycle’s first Lower High and a key Resistance level of the current Bull Cycle.” Given this, “Technically, as long as the 1D MA50 (blue trend-line) holds (has been doing so since Sep 28), that is a realistic end target for this bullish wave.” TradingShot stated.

In a Wednesday analysis, Tony reveals that “the green stair-stepping TDST support in Bitcoin hasn’t been broken since 2018.” As the analyst explains, the same primary bullish trend continues to apply even now. “IMO, we are dealing with the same active primary trend, much more advanced and mature than anyone is expecting – hence why we are already lifting off while others wait for the halving,” Tony explained.

This is largely due to the focus on the potential launch of spot bitcoin ETFs in January. Here is an update on what we know so far and what this could mean for the crypto ETF world. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) prices are near $44,000 and excitement is pouring into the space again. That’s largely due to the focus on the potential launch of spot bitcoin ETFs in January. Here is an update on what we know so far and what this could mean for the crypto ETF world. This includes crypto equity ETFs, which have fallen out of favor despite significantly high YTD returns. Spot bitcoin ETFs will potentially be launched in a month. The Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF’s (ARKB) final approval deadline with the SEC is January 10. It is widely expected that the SEC will approve its application (along with spot bitcoin ETF filings). The SEC has been active in its discussions. For the past few weeks, the SEC has been commenting on issuer filings and issuers have been updating their S-1s. While this is a normal part of the filing process, it illustrates that there has been progress toward approval. SEC has also met with issuers to discuss regulatory specifics. More recently, the SEC has met with issuers like BlackRock and Grayscale. Topics focused on regulatory specifics like BlackRock’s proposed in-kind creation and redemption model (where investors can redeem shares directly for bitcoin). The SEC has pushed for a cash creation and redemption model, which is safer from a regulatory standpoint. BlackRock has made some revisions to its model but has kept it as an in-kind model. While there may be some continued back-and-forth discussion, I don’t think this will be a huge roadblock to approval by January. There are currently about 13 issuers in line for a spot bitcoin ETF. These include conversions like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) and strategy changes like the Hashdex Bitcoin ETF ( DEFI ) in addition to 11 new filings and refilings. Most of these issuers are already active in the crypto ETF space. They either have a bitcoin or ether futures ETF product or a crypto industry ETF product. While the spot bitcoin ETF market seems oversaturated, several large issuers are missing. ProShares, which has been well-known in the crypto space for its Proshares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ) has not filed for a spot bitcoin ETF. Other crypto equity ETF issuers like First Trust, Schwab ( SCHW ), and Amplify also have not filed for a spot bitcoin ETF. The reasons are unclear but could have to do with resources (staff, time, funds) for spot bitcoin ETFs (similar to commodities) versus resources for equity ETFs. Issuers may also not want to cannibalize their own products. Crypto equity ETFs seem to have been forgotten but are the top-performing ETFs of the year. Prior to the release of BITO and its other bitcoin futures ETF peers, ETF investors were using industry crypto or thematic blockchain ETFs to access the crypto market. Currently, the top 10 sector ETFs YTD are all crypto or blockchain thematic ETFs. The Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF ( WGMI ) has been a top performer, returning over 200% YTD. It has been followed closely behind by the VanEck Digital Transformation ETF ( DAPP ) . These ETFs have been performing well since the beginning of the year due to lower prices at the end of 2022, particularly after the FTX fallout. Toward the end of 2023, these ETFs have seen even higher prices. That has been due to bitcoin prices rising on positive news from spot bitcoin ETFs. The biggest selling point of many crypto equity ETFs has been a close correlation to bitcoin prices. The funds all boast other advantages like supporting the digital disruption megatrend. But the blockchain story is still vague and foreign for many investors. And many of the individual stocks (particularly the miners) are volatile stocks. With crypto equity ETFs, the correlation with bitcoin prices is much higher than it is for crypto stocks and bitcoin prices. These ETFs may not be as good of a proxy for bitcoin prices after the launch of spot bitcoin ETFs, but they will still serve as high-risk/high-return options for investors who may want to capture potential large returns related to the crypto market.

GDLC currently trades at a 22% discount to its net asset value, creating potential arbitrage opportunities. Traders can go long GDLC while shorting the underlying assets or use it as a vehicle to get efficient access to Bitcoin, Ethereum, or its other underlying assets. The Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund ( GDLC ) is a closed-end fund that invests in five digital assets. The Fund's objective is to ensure that the value of its shares reflects the aggregate value of the digital assets it holds. When considering it keep in mind it charges a 2.5% fee and the index is periodically rebalanced. The rebalancing can have an impact on the weightings of the underlying. The fund currently trades at a 22% discount to net asset value or NAV. This is interesting for two primary reasons: 1) It opens up arbitrage opportunities where you can go long this fund and short derivatives of the underlying assets against it. 2) You can potentially get exposure to the underlying assets in a more efficient way. Even if you're not interested in arbitrage or most altcoins, the fund is still interesting. I don't know much about most altcoins, but I don't have any objections when I can arguably get them for free. What's interesting is that this fund mainly contains Bitcoin and Ethereum. Together, these two make up 95.77% of the fund's value. These are all of the assets and the weightings: NAME ASSETS/SHARE WEIGHT BTC Bitcoin 0.00039088 72.72% ETH Ethereum 0.00241048 23.05% SOL Solana 0.00827691 2.24% ADA Cardano 0.70422193 1.33% MATIC Polygon 0.1868414 0.66% Meanwhile, Bitcoin can be shorted in the futures market at NAV or through different derivatives. The Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ) trades at a 16% discount to its NAV. Ethereum ETFs or ETN's can be shorted in Canada and Europe at NAV. Wisdomtree has a physical Cardano ETP trading in Europe. These trades close to NAV. VanEck and 21Shares have products available on Matc trading in European markets. These trade at NAV. Here is today's overview of the Grayscale single-asset products and their discount to NAVs: Product AUM Holdings Per Share Market Price Per Share Discount to NAV (%) GBAT Grayscale Basic Attention Token Trust 1381587.79 2.23 3.1 -39.01345291 BCHG Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust 74524508.35 2.14 3.15 -47.19626168 GBTC Grayscale Bitcoin Trust 27174449964 39.25 34.92 11.03184713 GLNK Grayscale Chainlink Trust 4657094.23 14.51 47.99 -230.7374225 MANA Grayscale Decentraland Trust 8454293.08 4.45 11.5 -158.4269663 ETCG Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust 236808609.3 16.92 11.75 30.55555556 ETHE Grayscale Ethereum Trust 6686065847 21.56 18.02 16.41929499 FILG Grayscale Filecoin Trust 495299.09 4.45 30 -574.1573034 HZEN Grayscale Horizen Trust 6624134.47 0.97 1.9 -95.87628866 LTCN Grayscale Litecoin Trust 109080671.6 6.34 9.55 -50.63091483 GLIV Grayscale Livepeer Trust 3783051.99 6.15 10 -62.60162602 GSOL Grayscale Solana Trust 13064335.76 24.22 90.03 -271.7175888 GXLM Grayscale Stellar Lumens Trust 9058200.67 10.98 26.51 -141.43898 ZCSH Grayscale Zcash Trust 10204847.86 2.7 2.83 -4.814814815 When is this fund interesting? There are various kinds of investors/traders for whom GDLC is currently interesting. I'll go into the reasons why: 1. Arbs with constrained crypto access If you can't execute on any other arbs, I've been writing about here . It could be interesting to go long this fund and short the Bitcoin ETF ( BITO ), the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ((ETHE)) and Grayscale Solana Trust ( GSOL ) against it. 2. Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana Holders If you hold long-term single asset exposures to Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana or a combination of these through various Grayscale funds, it could be better to restructure that exposure. A share of GLDC is currently $18.42. As I write this pre-market on 7-12-2023, the fund contains the following crypto in USD values per unit: $16.89 Bitcoin $5.39 Ethereum $0.50 Solana $0.31 Cardano $0.153 Matic These numbers are stale by now, but will still illustrate the idea here. If you short a Bitcoin ETF against it, you almost get the other exposures for free. If you short Bitcoin ETFs against one unit of GLDC worth $16.89 per unit, short $1.22 worth of the Grayscale Ethereum Trust per unit, and $0.18 of the Grayscale Solana Trust per unit; you get: $4.35 Ethereum $0.31 Cardano $0.153 Matic Per unit as remaining long exposure per unit. Essentially, that's more or less free crypto exposure; theoretically, there is no market risk. In practice, keep in mind that these weird discounts can get even stranger and things may be marked against you in various ways. 3. If you hold Bitcoin and any combination of Ethereum/Cardano/Matic If you hold long-term asset exposure to Bitcoin and any other cryptos in this fund, it could be considered to switch to this fund. The obvious caveat is that you're potentially locked into paying 2.5% fees for a long time. Risks I want to get into some high-level and practical risks that investors/traders could face when trying to exploit the discount this type of closed-end fund trades at. This isn't an exhaustive list, but it is a good start: Conversion risk Grayscale has a clear intent to convert the Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. The market appears to be buying into the idea that Grayscale wants to convert its Ethereum product. I think that's a reasonable assumption. I'm not as sure the other funds, like this one, will be converted. It could depend on how the market develops. Will retaining locked-up assets under management be in the firm's best interest? Or if there is an opportunity to stake out the asset within a leading ETF wrapper? This matters because the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust trades like it does (at only an 11% discount to NAV) because of the expected imminent conversion. The conversion also likely involves reduced fees on the assets under management. I mention this because I've written several articles about GBTC while trading at ~37% discount to its net asset value. A fund like this could easily trade at a more significant discount if the crypto market cools off again. The GDLC fund (like most other Grayscale funds) charges a 2.5% fee. That's a lot of money; if you can't get out, you're stuck paying that. That's why closed-end funds usually trade at a discount. They can trade at a premium shortly after inception when running hot or the underlying asset is otherwise hard to access(point-in-case with these alternative crypto assets). Borrow Shorting incurs borrowing costs, and these are between reasonable and very high. I only call them reasonable in light of the incredible premia that some funds trade at. Check into these costs before setting up positions that require short positions because they can eat into the profit in a big way. For example, the annualized borrowing costs for the Grayscale Solana Trust are currently around ~60%. Premium widening The premia the Grayscale funds can trade at are so enormous that it is hard to say where they could go. An example is the Ethereum (ETH) trust having traded at a 3000%+ premium to NAV in the past. You could only combat this by waiting to engage in this trade when the premia starts falling. This is not a solution, but it could mitigate the risk. Collateral mismatch In theory, these are trades that have relatively little risk. You are holding similar assets on either side. In practice, it is possible your broker doesn't recognize this, and you get margin calls even though the position going against you is covered by a position moving in the right direction. My broker requires full collateral, and if the premium widens at first, it will quickly start eating into margin requirements. Positions need to be small and still require a lot of attention and active risk management. This is especially true if the long and short are held at different institutions. Conclusion The Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fun is a unique investment opportunity, particularly for those interested in the major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which constitute over 95% of the fund's value. Trading at a 22% discount to its net asset value, GDLC also opens up potential arbitrage opportunities. Traders can profit from the discount by going long GDLC while shorting the underlying indirectly, or employing alternative strategies to capitalize on the current market dynamics. One compelling thing about this opportunity is that setting up attractive arbitrage trades only requires access to U.S. publicly traded assets. The arbitrage trades are simple to understand, but they aren't easy to execute well. It's essential to consider the known risks and unexpected risks that may materialize. Some important risks are conversion risks, potential premium widening, borrowing costs, and collateral mismatches. In any closed-end fund arb it is essential to think through the risks well. It is especially true in the 24/7 fast-moving crypto markets.",POSITIVE,ADA | SOL,ADA | ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | SOL,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4656799-unpacking-grayscale-digital-large-caps-22-percent-nav-discount?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/21185908.jpeg

21185497,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=564562,1702036830,"Bitcoin Price Dips To $43,200: Buy Or Sell Now? Analyst Predicts Trend","Amidst a week of significant volatility in the cryptocurrency sphere, the Bitcoin price has been a focal point, especially following a dip below $43,200 today. After climbing to $44,533 on Tuesday, the price has since entered an ascending channel, touching a local low of $42,835 on Thursday. This trend has sparked a critical debate: is this a sign of an impending major correction following Bitcoin’s 65% rise in the past seven weeks, or is it a temporary bear trap in a continuing bullish market? Adam Cochran, partner at CEHV, has offered an in-depth analysis of the current Bitcoin market situation. Bitcoin Price Poised For Further Downside? Via X, Cochran began by assessing the market’s reaction to the recent price dip, “I was trying to decide if we were at ‘euphoria’ yet and due a major correction versus a mild pullback. But on this pullback, too many people went from ‘wgmi’ to ‘take money off the table’. In real euphoria, people just yolo every dip. This looks healthy + bullish.” This observation indicates that the market’s response to the price dip is not indicative of the ‘euphoria’ typically seen before a major market correction, suggesting a more stable and bullish sentiment. Further, Cochran delved into the intricacies of the futures market, noting the increase in Open Interest (OI) on the Bitcoin side and the decreased basis, signifying a move towards market equilibrium. Related Reading: Sam Altman-Backed Crypto Startup Looks To Secure $100 Million For Bitcoin Private Credit Fund He elaborated “On the BTC side, OI has increased while the basis has decreased, meaning the market has come a bit more towards equilibrium on futures.” This is a significant indicator of the market’s health. Cochran also examined the relationship between perpetual futures prices and spot prices. He remarked, “We’ve also got the perpetual futures price trading a bit above spot, which we’d expect, and it’s not overly optimistic – which is healthy.” This indicates a cautiously optimistic market, avoiding the extremes of pessimism or irrational exuberance. In his analysis, the crypto analyst also emphasized the potential impact of Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) on the market. He asserted, “Bitcoin is limited. Bitcoin futures are not. At the end of the day, 1 BTC > 1 BTC Perp.” This highlights the significance of the finite nature of Bitcoin compared to the more flexible futures market. The introduction of ETFs, which are required to buy spot Bitcoin, could significantly affect market liquidity and dynamics. The Most Important Bit Is What’s Missing Cochran claims that the pre-rally started with healthy buying between $16,000 to $18,000 support, then the rally got fueled by “bears being destroyed” and extended by refreshed spot buying, while earlier buyers did not distribute their coins. Related Reading: Why Bitcoin’s Staggering 260% YTD Surge Could Be Just The Start “But the most important part is actually what’s missing,” according to Cochran, who added “ETF buyers haven’t started buying yet. Retail buyers haven’t started buying yet. BTC didn’t break below the $42k support. BTC, a nearly $1T asset, is up 157% on the year, and retail inflow hasn’t even started yet.” These observations indicate that the Bitcoin rally has potentially much more fuel in the tank left. Cochran concluded: Imagine this: Next year Boomers sit down with their financial planner. They look at their 60/40 portfolio with a 5 year performance of 5%. They’ve just read about Bitcoin up 157% on the year nearing ATHs. Why wouldn’t they diversify 1% into this new BTC ETF? My hunch is even at these levels, any spot buying will be deeply in the money this time next year. In the short term, however, one thing is crucial: the BTC price must break out of the ascending trend channel in the lower time frames in order to trigger new upward momentum.

42391802,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfwJFf,1702036800,Bitcoin Halving Is Poised to Unleash Darwinism on Miners,"Darwinism could soon pummel some bitcoin [BTC] miners as the halving, a once-every-four-year event that cuts the reward for creating new BTC gets cut by 50%, unleashes a ""survival of the fittest"" battle in April.  To prepare for the disruptive event, larger companies are securing newer and more-efficient mining machines. But they might also consider gobbling up smaller miners as they figure out how to both survive and benefit from the halving.  Just ask Marathon Digital (MARA), the largest publicly traded miner by hashrate (industry jargon for the computing power it can direct toward running the Bitcoin network). The firm said this week that it's got a hoard of money – more than $800 million of cash and bitcoin – and will seek to grow that to ""capitalize on strategic opportunities, including industry consolidation"" ahead of the halving.  Meanwhile, another large miner, Hut 8 (HUT), just completed its all-stock merger with a privately held US Bitcoin. CleanSpark (CLSK) has been collecting cheap assets since the start of the bear market and said it has almost $170 million shored up to ""take advantage of opportunities the halving may present."" And Riot Platforms (RIOT), another institutional-grade miner, has just ordered 66,560 new mining machines for $290.5 million to stay ahead of the competition.  The scene is set for a dog-eat-dog competition.  ""Leading up to the halving and in its aftermath, miners will need to place substantial emphasis on strategic planning. The adage, 'If you aren't growing, you are dying,' holds true,"" said Amanda Fabiano, the former head of Galaxy Mining who started her own consulting services company for the industry.  In fact, mining consultancy firm Blocksbridge said that a dozen public mining companies have already committed over $1.2 billion so far this year to buy mining machines, with about $750 million signed over the past two months.  Growth at any cost  So, how did we get here and why are the miners racing to gear up for the halving?  The bitcoin halving – also known as the halvening – in simple terms will make obtaining or mining new bitcoin much harder. The halving is part of the Bitcoin network's code to reduce inflationary pressure on the cryptocurrency and will cut the rewards in half for successfully mining a bitcoin block.  A useful analogy that might resonate with the non-crypto crowd: think about extracting a finite natural resource, such as gold or oil, from the ground. The more that's obtained, the less that's left, making the remaining resource more valuable yet more expensive to extract.  Now, swap out whatever traditional commodity you had in mind, and replace it with bitcoin and and crypto mining. That's the halving: a classic example of the supply-and-demand cycle creating scarcity-driven value for an asset. It's something Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto believed in. In fact, bitcoin might actually be even more scarce than gold.  For a deeper understanding of the halving, read CoinDesk's explainer here.  Historically, the event has increased bitcoin prices exponentially, creating generational wealth for investors – but a presenting challenge for the miners that actually create BTC. During the third halving, which occurred in 2020, bitcoin's price went from around $8,500 to nearly $18,000 within a few months, while the reward for successfully mining a block was cut to 6.25 BTC from 12.5 BTC.  This time, the reward will sink to 3.125 BTC, making mining even more competitive.  In previous cycles, there weren't many large-scale miners and even fewer publicly traded ones. During the lead-up to the bull market of 2021, a swath of miners jumped into the sector to reap nearly 90% profit margins at the peak. As bitcoin neared $70,000, miners were making money hand over fist and many were spending and taking on debt to grow faster. Investors, including traditional financial firms, lavishing miners with cash to fuel grow also incentivized breakneck spending and growth at any cost.  It all came crashing down during the 2022 bear market. Profit margins got crushed, some big miners filed for bankruptcy and access to capital markets was shut. Many miners still operating are barely surviving, waiting for the next bull run to save them.  Read more: Next Bitcoin Halving Event Could Be a Stress Test for Miners  The rally in bitcoin prices in 2023, fueled mostly by the optimism that U.S. regulators will approve spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from the likes of BlackRock, has helped miners somewhat. But with the Bitcoin network's hashrate at an all-time high (a sign of high competition), the difficulty mining a single block also at a record, high energy prices (crypto mining rigs use a lot of electricity), intense regulatory scrutiny and still-bone-dry capital markets, the mining landscape remains tough.  Consolidation 'wave'  Miners who grew too fast are now cash-strapped and looking for a light at the end of the tunnel. Struggling miners need to cut costs, shore up their balance sheets and require more capital – all potential catalysts for mergers and acquisitions in the industry.  Cutting ""costs will likely be a major drive of an upcoming wave of consolidation in the mining industry. Executive salaries, insurance and other expenses benefit from economies of scale in the post-halving environment,"" said Ethan Vera, chief operating officer at mining services firm Luxor Technologies.  M&A can take many shapes and forms and can be complicated. However, one of the trends that might be prominent, according to Vera, is private miners merging with public companies. ""Off the back of bitcoin price momentum, shareholders of private and public mining companies will look for avenues to liquidate parts of this position through publicly listed vehicles. As such, many private companies will merge with public operating companies or shells to gain access to this liquidity,"" he said.  They will likely follow Hut 8's merger and use that as a ""case study to combine entities that have both strong balance sheets alongside high growth opportunities,"" Vera added.  Fabiano echoed this when asked about how this will play out. ""Mid-tier and small-scale miners should prioritize positioning themselves on the lower end of the cost curve, one likely path is M&A given the capital-constrained market. Meanwhile, larger miners should concentrate on growth narratives that set them apart from their rivals,"" she said.  It seems the rule of the jungle is about to be unleashed on the mining industry, perhaps best expressed by a Japanese idiom: ""Jakuniku-kyoushoku,"" which loosely translates to English as ""the flesh of the weak is the food of the strong.""

21184086,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=564520,1702033235,Liquidation Quandary: Litecoin Wallets Draining Fast – What’s Next For LTC Prices?,"Litecoin (LTC) suffered a major fall after a week of consistent growth, posing possible difficulties going forward. According to recent data, a significant proportion of wallets have sold their Bitcoin holdings. As of this writing, LTC is trading at $74.60, down 1.1% from its peak price over the previous day. This decline has also had an effect on LTC’s market capitalization. With Litecoin’s market value falling by 55% compared to Bitcoin in just five months, the price chart for LTC presents a bleak image. This sharp decline in value is indicative of investors’ diminishing trust as they choose to sell off more and more of their holdings. Related Reading: This BRC-20 Token Just Breached $1 Billion Market Cap With 180% Rally Today – Details Litecoin Downturn: Small Investors Flee, Raising Long-Term Viability Concerns Santiment claims that 199,000 wallets that contained Litecoin around 10 days ago are no longer in possession of the cryptocurrency. This pattern could explain why, in comparison to other prominent cryptocurrencies previously discussed, the coin has performed comparatively poorly over the last week and year. ⚡️ Approximately 199K wallets that held $LTC 10 days ago, no longer hold any coins. This is the biggest drop in wallets since October 2022. $LTC‘s market value vs. $BTC has dropped -55% in 5 months, but #FUD & small wallets dropping could turn this around. https://t.co/tIAj6ULd95 pic.twitter.com/SuhqULLfFm — Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 7, 2023 Interestingly, small-scale holders account for the majority of the wallets that collapse, which contrasts with the tenacity exhibited by Sharks and Whales in the cryptocurrency space, according to Santiment. It seems that small investors—who are frequently the most susceptible to market swings—are the main group selling their holdings, presumably because they are worried about the investments’ long-term sustainability and liquidity. The significant departure of almost 199,000 wallets that previously contained LTC is a noteworthy phenomena that should not be disregarded. The significant decline in selling activity reflects a more widespread feeling of apprehension, uncertainty, and skepticism that has negatively impacted the asset. LTC market cap currently at $5.499 billion on the daily chart: TradingView.com Up to 2.13% of all Litecoin wallets have sold off their LTC since late November, according to the most recent data. On the Litecoin network, at least 9.11 million addresses now hold zero coins. As some of the top cryptocurrencies have experienced incredible price increases—gaining over 100% in the year thus far—Litecoin has remained relatively stable, showing a growth of less than 4% year to date. For about two weeks, the price of LTC has been consistently fluctuating between $70 and $75. In the second half of the month, there was a narrow trading range between $68 and $72. LTC’s Resilience: Navigating Liquidation In Leveraged Trading In order to forcefully end a trader’s leveraged position once a trader loses all or a portion of their initial margin, the exchange uses a process known as liquidation. It occurs when a trader doesn’t have enough money to maintain an open position in a leveraged position, or can’t meet the margin requirements for the position. Source: Bitpay LTC maintained a high trading volume even as its price went sideways. Additionally, its MVRV ratio was higher, which is often an indication of good health. However, even with a decline, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) stayed over the neutral threshold of 50. By doing this, the coin may be able to satisfy investors and continue its bull run.

Meanwhile, the biggest crypto payment processor in the world, BitPay, now accepts LTC as its preferred coin. Beyond Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH], it has demonstrated its supremacy in practical applications, accounting for 34% of BitPay’s payment count in cryptocurrency.

This burning mechanism seems to have undergone an update, which could further enhance its performance. Shibarium Undergoes Swift Hard Fork A screenshot containing a discord message from DaVinci (a member of the Shiba Inu development team) surfaced online recently. In the message, DaVinci mentioned that Shibarium would undergo a hard fork at Block 1962000. That suggests that the upgrade already took place as there are already over 2 million blocks on the layer-2 network at the time of writing. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale With Over $60 Million In Unrealized Profits Moves Coins To Exchange Meanwhile, the main purpose of this hard fork is to enhance the network’s burning mechanism. This will enable support for multiple burn tokens, with BONE and SHIB (the governance tokens of Shibarium) being the main focus. DaVinci also mentioned to node providers that a Genesis update would be required since it was a hard fork. Further Clarification On What The Hard Fork Entails For Shiba Inu Shibarium had earlier provided clarification of what this new era of the network entails. A blog post published on the Shibarium site mentioned that Shibarium’s burning mechanism will initially be manually managed as part of this upgrade. This is to ensure alignment with the network’s health and sustainability. In this phase, the burn process will be managed by the official deployer. Once that is done, Shibarium will apparently transition to an automated system starting in January. As part of this transition, Shibarium is expected to witness further upgrades in a bid to “enhance efficiency and reliability.” According to the network, the automated burn process “will operate based on predefined rules,” although it didn’t provide further details on this. Related Reading: Crypto Pundit Reveals Why Bitcoin Is Worth As Much As $17 Million Node provider NOWNodes noted in a blog post that this upgrade will also facilitate mass adoption for Shibarium. That could explain why there is a need to enhance the burning mechanism as part of the upgrade. Considering that there is a correlation between the transaction volume and token burns, Shibarium needs to be well prepared to handle the number of tokens that need to be burnt following a potential increase in transaction count. The layer-2 network is currently flying high as the total transaction count on it continues to skyrocket. According to data from the Shibarium Explorer, the total transactions on the network stand at over 58 million at the time of writing. Shibarium has surpassed the milestones of 5 million, 10 million, 20 million, and 35 million mark in just about a week.

Questions remain as to how useful crypto is for terror financing, with figures showing it is relatively small compared with traditional methods.  A bipartisan group of U.S. senators including Mitt Romney (R-UT) introduced legislation that expands sanctions to foreign entities supporting all U.S.-designated terrorist groups, including through crypto transactions, giving law enforcement an additional toolkit to tackle terror financing.  ""The Terrorist Financing Prevention Act of 2023, introduced by the Senators, aims to prevent Foreign Terrorist Organizations and their financial enablers, including those using digital assets, from accessing U.S. financial institutions, imposing sanctions and strict regulations to counteract these activities,"" the bill reads.  The proposed act broadens current sanctions, initially focused on Hezbollah, to include all U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organizations and their supporting foreign entities.  “The October 7 attacks on Israel perpetrated by Hamas have made it more urgent and necessary for the U.S. to counter the role that cryptocurrency plays in the financing of terrorism,"" Romney said in a release. ""Our legislation would expand financial sanctions to cover all terrorist organizations – including Hamas– and it would equip the Treasury Department with additional resources to counter terrorism and address emerging threats involving digital assets.”  Disputed role in financing terror  Crypto as a tool for terror financing has long been a concern of regulators and law enforcement.  In the most recent debate among Republican presidential candidates, Vivek Ramaswamy – who has made support for crypto a pillar of his campaign – was asked a question that couched digital assets as a tool for ""fraudsters, criminals, and terrorists.""  The debate on whether crypto finances terrorism, sparked by a Wall Street Journal report saying Palestinian groups received substantial funds in crypto, is complex and unresolved, with blockchain analytics firms like Chainalysis suggesting such claims are likely overstated, CoinDesk recently reported.  There is no substantial evidence supporting significant crypto donations to Hamas, blockchain security firm Elliptic wrote in a recent post, and analysis suggests such claims are likely exaggerated.  Elliptic first revealed that a series of wallets seized by Israel's National Bureau for Counter-Terror Financing held nearly $94 million in July. The company updated the blog post after the Journal cited its findings in the October report.  The transparency of the blockchain and the sophistication of monitoring tools mean fund flows can be tracked and frozen. Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, has frozen more than 100 accounts thought to be linked to Hamas at the request of Israeli law enforcement since the Oct. 7 attacks. As early as April, Hamas' military wing stopped accepting crypto donations in order to protect its supporters.  Hamas and Hezbollah, designated as terror organizations by the U.S. and many other jurisdictions worldwide, now increasingly use the Tron blockchain over Bitcoin, Reuters reported, but seizures amounted to less than 150 wallets and around $130 million.  In comparison, publicly released intelligence reports suggest that Hamas generates $1 billion per year, with $500 million coming from tax revenue and approximately $100 million from Iran.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/12/08/bipartisan-anti-crypto-terror-financing-bill-heads-to-us-senate,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6a44e2109a764dcec0774defd684d945b8eb3064-1200x675.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The nation kickstarted its ""Freedom VISA"" program on Thursday, doling out residency to a maximum of 1,000 people per year who invest at least $1 million worth of bitcoin or tether [USDT] stablecoins.  Eligible participants receive a long-term residency permit and have a path to full citizenship. An application costs a non-refundable $999 in BTC or USDT, and the process has gone live as of Friday.  The technical process is handled by Tether Global, the issuer of USDT.  This is similar to the concept of a ""Golden VISA"" offered by several nations, where wealthy people can invest a certain amount into that country's bonds or property in return for a residency permit.  Taking bitcoin or tether investments for residency is a first for any nation. El Salvador could receive at least $1 billion in deposits if the quora are filled every year.

21180581,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=564517,1702024039,Why Is Solana Price Up Today? 4 Major Reasons,"The Solana (SOL price has risen by more than 14% in the last 24 hours and is now trading above $71. Here are the major reasons for SOL’s latest price rally. #1 Solana Price Follows Bitcoin’s Chart Pattern The Solana price is on the verge of mirroring the price action of Bitcoin (BTC) from last week. Crypto Analyst Jelle highlighted the similarities in a post on X. He stated, “In bull markets, the simple patterns suddenly start working again. Can SOL follow in Bitcoin’s footsteps? Simple patterns still work. Let’s go!!” $SOL Simple patterns still work. Let's go!! https://t.co/YFHliFfkG1 pic.twitter.com/dddH2XB5du — Jelle (@CryptoJelleNL) December 8, 2023 So, what’s the backstory? The Solana price chart currently mirrors Bitcoin’s recent pattern, exhibiting an ascending triangle formation. This bullish pattern, characterized by a flat upper trend line as resistance and an ascending lower trend line as support, suggests accumulation by buyers and potential for upward momentum. Bitcoin demonstrated this pattern with a resistance line around $38,000 and an ascending trend line from early November lows. Last Friday, December 1, Bitcoin broke through the neckline which led to a surge to over $44,000. Similarly, Solana’s chart shows a resistance near $68 and a comparable ascending trend line from mid-November. With Solana breaking through the $68 resistance today, parallels are being drawn to Bitcoin’s rally, suggesting that the SOL price could even move higher in the coming hours and days. #2 Airdrop Seasons Attracts Investors Airdrop season is coming to the Solana ecosystem. While the JITO airdrop (Jito is a Solana-based liquid staking token protocol) made waves yesterday, new ones like Kamino Finance and Celestia (TIA) are already on the horizon. Airdrops historically have a very positive impact on the layer-1 coin as they attract new capital to the ecosystem, most necessitating the purchase of the L1 coin like SOL. Related Reading: Solana Ascending Triangle Formation Anticipates Price Surge, $90 Target In Sight Chris Burniske, partner at Placeholder VC, remarked, “Community-focused airdrops within the Solana community will induce tremendous wealth & loyalty effects, further washing away the ashes as the phoenix rises. This trend is only just gaining steam. […] Congrats to all JTO hodlers and Jito users that have been rewarded – Jito and its peers are actively discussing how to fairly include & incent their communities, at scale.” #3 Network Growth Continues Solana’s DeFi sector is expanding rapidly. Analyst Jay highlighted several key metrics: net inflows from ETH to SOL via Wormhole surpassed 48 million in the last 30 days, DEX volume surged from 17.69 million on October 14 to 466.44 million on November 10, and stablecoin market cap increased by over 100 million since October 16. Related Reading: Solana Dominates Ethereum In Daily Active Wallets, SOL Back To $140? DeFiLama data shows Solana’s TVL in DeFi applications grew 117% in the last month to $840.99 million, ranking sixth among all chains and leading in percentage growth. Ethereum, despite leading with a TVL of $29.77 billion, only saw a 46% increase. #4 Endorsement By Arthur Hayes And VanEck Arthur Hayes, BitMEX founder, has been bullish on SOL in recent days, predicting a rise to $100. He expressed this sentiment on X, stating, “Who is ready for a weekend alt szn green doji piss up? Can we send SOL over $100? Let’s do it fam.” In another post, he added: “Tis the season for stinky fruit bitches. Can’t stop, won’t stop until SOL = $100.” Remarkably, financial giant VanEck has also been extremely bullish on Solana in its Bitcoin and crypto predictions for 2024. The firm predicts that Solana “will become a top 3 blockchain by market cap, Total Value Locked (TVL), and active users.” According to the analysis, “ETH will lose market share to other smart contract platforms with less uncertainty surrounding their scalability roadmap, such as Solana.” VanEck added that “decentralized exchange (DEX) market share of spot crypto trading will rise to an all-time high as high-throughput chains like Solana improve the on-chain trading experience for users.” At press time, SOL traded at $71.67.

LayerZero developers said Friday morning that they planned to issue a token sometime in the first half of 2024, confirming widespread rumors and causing an immediate uptick in the metrics of some projects built on that network.  The network is an interoperability protocol that uses a novel technique to make it easier for different blockchain networks to connect. Its developer, LayerZero Labs, raised $120 million at a $3 billion valuation in April.  “LayerZero has always been built with the ability to have a native token within the protocol, as seen in the immutable code launched on day 1,” developers said in an X post. “We’ve heard the community discussion over the last few months and the lack of clear communication around this.’  “We’ll state now in no uncertain terms that there will be a LayerZero token. We’re committed to getting its distribution right and expect it to happen within the first half of 2024,” they added.  Airdrops refer to the unsolicited distribution of a project’s tokens to its users, usually in return for tasks or liquidity.  These are often worth a lot of money. On Thursday, Solana ecosystem project Jito dropped its JTO token starting at 4,941 tokens and increasing depending on how much they used its so-called liquid staking token (LST), jitoSOL.  Some users claimed to have received as much as $200,000 worth of JTO tokens. Not everyone is selling, however, with some users supplying their holdings back to other Solana projects in hopes of more airdrops in the future.  Meanwhile, after the Friday announcement, some LayerZero ecosystem projects saw a boost in token prices and locked value.  Tokens of Stargate and Radiant Capital, two projects that use LayerZero, surged as much as 10% before quickly reversing.  As of Friday, LayerZero has not outright mentioned how it intends to reward users for using its network. However, popular strategies include merely interacting with LayerZero-based platforms by using their services, such as borrowing, trading or lending.",POSITIVE,SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | SOL | TRADING | AIRDROP,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/12/08/layerzero-confirms-airdrop-plans-boosting-some-ecosystem-projects,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d30e303c503ef87f6e4e1c40ea275d1202e7055f-5000x2813.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42391801,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfwJKn,1702019967,"Bitcoin, Ether Options' Value on Deribit Reaches Record High of $23B","Bitcoin [BTC] and ether [ETH] options trading on Deribit are hotter than ever.  As of Friday, the cumulative dollar value locked in the number of open or outstanding BTC and ETH options contracts, also known as notional open interest, was $23.6B, the highest ever, Deribit’s Chief Commercial Officer Luuk Strijers told CoinDesk.  Bitcoin options accounted for 67% of the tally, with ether contributing the rest. On Deribit, one options contract represents one BTC and one ETH.  “Deribit options notional open interest has reached a new ATH with $16 billion in BTC options and $7.6 billion in ETH options outstanding, resulting in a total of $23.6 billion. When adding the $2.2 billion in perpetuals and futures OI, Deribit has for the first time reached the $25 billion milestone (total now $25.8B!),” Strijers told CoinDesk.  Options allow investors to take leveraged bets on the underlying asset and hedge their spot/futures market exposure. A call option gives the right but not the obligation to purchase the underlying asset at a predetermined price at a later date. A put gives the right to sell.  Options trading is three-dimensional, allowing investors to bet on the direction of the price move, the degree of expected price volatility and time. The spot and futures markets are one-dimensional, focusing just on price direction.  Therefore, the record options open interest represents an influx of sophisticated traders in the crypto market and promises better price discovery.  At press time, most open interest in bitcoin and ether options was concentrated in call options. In bitcoin’s case, a large concentration of open interest is seen in calls at $50,000, $40,000, and $45,000 strikes. In ether’s case, calls at $2,300, $2,400, $2,500 and $3,000 are the most popular.  The bias for calls is consistent with the ongoing rally in both cryptocurrencies and suggests expectations for continued upside.  Bitcoin topped the $44,000 mark early this week, reaching the highest since April 2022, largely on the back of ETF optimism and receding U.S. Treasury yields. The leading cryptocurrency has gained over 150% this year.  Ether neared $2,400 early today, the highest since May 2022, extending the year-to-date gain to 98%.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/12/08/bitcoin-ether-options-value-on-deribit-reach-record-high-of-23b,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ddf3881618dea182de0c2a4fc86e76a710fcd63f-1280x853.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

While BLUR retreats, on-chain data reveals that BLUR whales have been moving their tokens to leading crypto exchanges, possibly to liquidate. Whales On A Possible Selling Spree According to Lookonchain data on December 7, several whales have been offloading large amounts of BLUR. To illustrate, 16.85 million BLUR, worth roughly $8.43 million, were deposited to exchanges in the past 24 hours. Notably, one whale deposited 2.54 million BLUR, worth $1.26 million, received from the airdrop to Binance. At the same time, Mandala Capital transferred 2.76 million BLUR, worth $1.4 million, to OKX. The deluge continued as another whale, only marked by the associated “0x68b5” address, withdrew 3.31 million BLUR worth $1.79 million from Binance between November 25 and 29 before moving them to the same exchange on December 1. The token had fallen, meaning the whale was down by roughly $65,000. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Spot ETFs Attract Enough Capital? Experts On What Will Lead To ATH It is unclear whether the same addresses are sold for USDT or other tokens. However, what’s known is that any whale transfers to a centralized exchange is associated with liquidation. Accordingly, sentiment is impacted when whales move coins in large batches to exchanges, and retailers could interpret their transfers as incoming selling pressure. BLUR Is Up 220% From October Lows Thus far, looking at price action, buyers have the lead from a top-down preview. The coin is already up 220% from October lows. Most importantly, buyers have the upper hand, looking at the candlestick arrangement in the daily chart. Even though the token is down 30% from November peaks, the failure of bears to force the coin below the 20-day moving average (MA) in the daily chart suggests that the uptrend is still valid. Losses below $0.46, or the base of the current bull flag, might trigger a sell-off. Conversely, any upswing above $0.58 and even $0.69–or November highs, could drive more demand, lifting BLUR to $0.84 or higher in the coming sessions. Related Reading: Binance CEO Disputes JPMorgan Chief’s Critique Of Crypto Whether the uptrend will resume also remains to be seen. What’s clear, though, is that the broader community is closely monitoring the NFT scene and Blur, the marketplace. The recent upswing was due to the activation of Season 2 Airdrop, which ended on November 20. Ahead of this, the token was already up 150%, only to extend gains briefly before cooling off in the first week of December.

Zhao, who pleaded guilty to one charge of violating the Bank Secrecy Act last month, is set to be scheduled in February 2024. He was released on a $175 million personal recognizance bond, putting up some cash in escrow and having guarantors put up around $5 million worth of assets as collateral. While Zhao's bond originally allowed him to return to the UAE, where he, his children and his partner all live, prosecutors argued he was a flight risk and should not be permitted to leave the U.S.  District Judge Richard Jones, of the Western District of Washington, agreed with the Department of Justice.  ""The defendant has articulated justifications that in most cases would cause the government’s motion to be denied,"" the judge wrote. ""However, a critical feature of the government’s motion is the extent of the defendant’s enormous wealth and absence of an extradition treaty with the UAE. In addition, the defendant’s family resides in the UAE and there is no indication he has any other ties to the United States. While the defendant has indicated he will be asking for a lesser sentence, the government has indicated it may be asking for as much as 18 months of incarceration. Consequently, the defendant is not facing an insignificant sentence.""  Zhao faces potentially up to 18 months, though he may serve as few as 10, the judge, who accepted the guilty plea earlier this week, noted.

After a strong start over the summer, engagement with Base during the recent crypto run has been disappointing. Coinbase's centralized exchange has seen a surge in volume over the last two months. When I last covered Coinbase ( COIN ) for Seeking Alpha, the company had just launched its Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) scaling chain called ""Base."" The logic behind Base actually makes quite a bit of sense for Coinbase. One of the core mantras from cryptocurrency advocates since Bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) genesis block has been ""decentralization."" Even though Coinbase has been an important figure in the early years of this industry, as a centralized exchange there is a distinct possibility that the company's core business will erode as decentralized exchanges, or DEXes, continue to siphon share from their centralized counterparts. DEX volume Share (TheBlock) Before the 2020 bull run, DEX volume was non-existent. However, even through crypto winter the trend for DEX volume share growth has generally persisted. The big difference this cycle is the DEX protocols are arguably even better than they were just a couple years ago. Early implementations of popular DEX protocols like Uniswap ( UNI-USD ) or SushiSwap ( SUSHI-USD ) have typically not enabled cross-chain swaps. Meaning, Ethereum holders were generally limited to Ethereum-based swaps. To swap ETH to BTC, a token holder either had to swap from ETH to a derivative token like Wrapped Bitcoin ( WBTC-USD ) or do the swap through a centralized exchange like Coinbase. Today, we have cross-chain swap networks like Thorchain ( RUNE-USD ) exploding in popularity. These networks are in direct competition with Coinbase today and in the future. THORChain TVL (Token Terminal) With this as our backdrop for today's update, COIN investors should be rooting for strong user engagement with the company's Ethereum L2 long term. At least during this recent crypto run, an increased level of Base usage hasn't yet manifested. An Updated Look At Base In my August Coinbase article, Base had just a few weeks of transaction history but there were already very promising signs from the network's early adoption. Since then, we've seen usage of the chain essentially collapse even as the broader crypto ecosystem has experienced a resurgence. The 7 day average for daily transactions has fallen from over 1 million at the beginning of October to just over 270k at the beginning of December: Base transactions (Dune Analytics/watermeloncrypto) If the broader ecosystem was in decline, this may not be as concerning. But when adjusting Base transaction volume to network share, we can get a better sense for how poorly Base has performed in recent months: L2 Transaction Share (IntoTheBlock) Base's share of transaction volume between fellow ETH scalers Arbitrum ( ARB-USD ) and Optimism ( OP-USD ) has dropped from a high of 47% on August 12th down to 12.3% on December 4th. From a decentralized finance (or DeFi) standpoint, Base' total value locked (or TVL) on the chain actually appears to have peaked in October: Base TVL in ETH (L2Beat) After chopping around between 340-350k ETH between early-September and October, coins have started to come back out of the chain since. TVL currently stands at 277k ETH - which is down 22% from the high just a couple months ago. The stablecoin footprint on Base is also a cause for concern: Base Stablecoins (DeFi Llama) After peaking at $152.6 million on September 4th, stablecoins on Base have fallen by over 44% down to $85 million as of December 5th. This is all while the broader stablecoin market over that timeframe has increased by over 3%, or roughly $4 billion. If I can say one good thing about Base it's that it remains one of the few profitable chains in the crypto ecosystem. Base Earnings (Dune Analytics/watermeloncrypto) That said, profit has been declining even as revenue has stabilized in part due to higher gas fees on the main layer. It also is important to remember that cumulatively the earnings from operating this network is a tick above $5 million in the 5 months since the chain went live. The point is, if Base is ever to become an important part of the Coinbase's future business, it still has a very long way to go and a theoretically positive macro backdrop isn't helping it. The Core Business Of course, Base is just a single project within the broader Coinbase business. The bread and butter is still the company's revenue from its centralized exchange transaction fees and interest income. At the end of Q3-23, Coinbase reported $674 million in total revenue and had its best quarter from a net income standpoint since Q4-21 after losing just $2.3 million. Data by YCharts A large driver of Coinbase's net income reversal in recent quarters comes from stablecoin revenue that the company shares with Circle. Circle is the issuer of USCoin USD ( USDC-USD ) and the collateral backing those stablecoins is short duration US treasuries. If you believe that the Federal Reserve will begin to cut rates in 2024, the interest on that collateral may ultimately come down. Transaction Revenue (Coinbase) If rates do indeed come down, Coinbase shareholders will need the transaction revenue trend to turn around as well. And that brings us to Q4. We do have some data from The Block that could give COIN shareholders some degree of confidence in this figure rising in the next earnings report. Exchange Volume (The Block) Monthly exchange volume has started to pick back up. In the company's guidance, management noted $105 million of total transaction revenue during the month of October. Using the data from The Block, that revenue came on $31.16 billion in exchange volume. Using that same margin on volume and the $50.4 billion in exchange volume Coinbase just did last month, COIN may have just earned as much as $170 million in total transaction revenue in November. If that estimate is accurate, COIN is already very close to matching transaction revenue from Q3 in the first two months of Q4. Investor Takeaway As I've laid out in this article, I think Coinbase has a fundamental flaw in the current business model. The issue with centralized exchanges is the better the decentralized protocols and networks get, the less need there is for the legacy players. I don't think anyone could or should reasonably expect Base to be a significant driver of Coinbase's revenue story today. But if the company is going to counteract the long term trend of transactions moving directly on-chain, it is going to need a robust on-chain footprint as well. So far, that story is not great and I'd even go as far as saying the lack of user engagement with COIN's L2 solution during what is generally a broad crypto rally may be a cause for concern.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4656689-crypto-euphoria-coinbases-l2-hasnt-gotten-the-memo?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/21170342.jpeg

The fund, known as Meanwhile Private Credit Fund aims to provide institutional investors with access to BTC while targeting an additional 5% yield denominated in the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Rally Sparks Launch Of Meanwhile Advisors Fund According to a report by The Block, Meanwhile Advisors has launched the fund as Bitcoin continues its recent rally, with prices currently falling from the $44,000 level down to the $43,200 mark. Zac Townsend, the co-founder and CEO of Meanwhile Group, stated that the belief is that Bitcoin will appreciate significantly in the future, and the fund offers investors a unique opportunity to increase their exposure to digital assets. Related Reading: Solana Ascending Triangle Formation Anticipates Price Surge, $90 Target In Sight The Meanwhile BTC Private Credit Fund adopts a single-close, closed-end structure. Participating limited partners (LPs) will contribute US dollars to the fund, which will be immediately converted to Bitcoin following the single close. Meanwhile will lend this BTC to borrowers to generate the targeted 5% return in Bitcoin. This structure allows LPs to accumulate more Bitcoin if its price appreciates during the fund’s lifecycle without requiring additional principal investment. Townsend mentioned that the minimum investment amount per LP is $250,000, with no maximum limit. The fund’s investment period spans three years, followed by a four-year harvest period, resulting in a total term of seven years. However, capital is returned to investors during harvest, meaning a significant portion of the invested capital may be returned well before the seven-year mark. Innovative Fee Approach? Per the report, the Meanwhile BTC Private Credit Fund charges a 2% management fee and a 20% carried interest fee, both in Bitcoin. The carried interest fee only applies when the LP’s Bitcoin holdings are increased. This fee structure ensures that if Bitcoin experiences substantial price appreciation, Meanwhile does not benefit from the price appreciation itself but rather from generating more Bitcoin for the LPs. Addressing concerns about risk management, Townsend highlighted that the closed structure of the fund eliminates the risk of a “bank run” scenario that can lead to insolvency. Moreover, the fund focuses on making conservative loans to “creditworthy institutional borrowers”, mitigating risks associated with lending to retail investors at higher rates. Related Reading: Why Bitcoin’s Staggering 260% YTD Surge Could Be Just The Start The Block also reported that Anchorage Digital serves as the fund’s custodian. Meanwhile Group’s insurance unit has previously launched a Bitcoin-denominated life insurance policy, and Townsend mentioned plans to introduce an accidental death coverage policy in Bitcoin as well. When writing, the leading cryptocurrency in the market is trading at $43,200, marking a decrease of nearly 2% within the last 24 hours. This decline follows an unsuccessful attempt to solidify its position above the significant $44,000 milestone. Nevertheless, Bitcoin has managed to maintain a 14% increase over the past seven days and is currently holding strong at the support level of $43,000, as it sets its sights on achieving a new annual peak.

Token Terminal data on December 7 shows that in the past year, the smart contract platform paid over $275 million in AVAX to compensate its validators despite generating only $11.5 million in user fees. Avalanche Is Paying A Premium To Incentivize Validators Although it appears that Avalanche is paying a premium for validators, this is critical in securing the network and ensuring all transactions are confirmed. Overall, and being a proof-of-stake network reliant on node operators for security and decentralization, Avalanche’s decision to pay validators a premium is, as its users demand, to maintain a robust network of nodes. Related Reading: Bitcoin Shakeout Drives $190 Million In Losses For Over 81,000 Traders According to CoinMarketCap data, the network has a market cap of over $9.8 billion. It is currently in the top 10 by liquidity, surpassing Polygon and Polkadot, competing low-fee alternatives. As it is, by incentivizing validators with generous rewards, Avalanche ensures that there is a strong pool of nodes available to maintain the network’s operation. Through these validators, AVAX holders can stake and receive rewards. As of December 7, there are over 1,539 validators currently staking over 248 million AVAX and earning 7.84% APY. At the same time, statistics show that Avalanche has a staking ratio of 57.11%. Most AVAX in circulation are used to secure the network at this level. While AVAX incentivization might draw more validators, Avalanche documentation also states that the network doesn’t require complex hardware to operate a node. At the same time, the blockchain, unlike Ethereum, states that staked AVAX is not at risk of being slashed–or penalized by the network–provided all network requirements are met. This feature could explain the steady rise in validator count over the past three years. AVAX Is Up By 200%, Trading At 2023 High While Avalanche grows its validator count, AVAX prices have also been expanding steadily, mirroring the general market. Thus far, AVAX is changing hands above $26, up over 200% in the last three months.
