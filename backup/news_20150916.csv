42426483,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtEjh,1442433326,Russian Official: Payment Giant Qiwi's Digital Currency Idea 'Illegal',"A Russian government official has spoken out against a leading domestic payments company's plan to release its own digital currency sometime next year.  Reports by Russian-language news services Kommersant and Pravda suggest that QIWI, a Moscow-based payments firm, is working to develop a bitcoin-like currency that will be a virtualization of the ruble. Sergei Solonin, QIWI’s CEO, told Kommersant in an interview that the concept could be deployed as early as next year.  However, a report from state-owned news service TASS suggests that Russian officials aren't warm to the concept.  According to TASS, Russian financial ombudsman Pavel Medvedev dismissed the concept as against the country's laws, stating during a radio appearance:  ""It's absolutely illegal, such technical hooliganism [is] absolutely inappropriate. The Constitution says who has the right to Russia to issue money - it is the central bank. The only currency in Russia is the ruble.""  QIWI, according to financial statements published in Marchhttps://investor.qiwi.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=901214, oversaw $11.5bn in payments volume during 2014 and total adjusted net revenue of $157.1m over the course of that year.  The news comes as bitcoin and digital currencies experience significant headwinds in Russia. Earlier this summer, Russian president Vladimir Putin spoke of the “serious, really fundamental issues related to its wider usage” when speaking of types of electronic money, including bitcoin.  It remains clear whether QIWI’s digital currency dream becomes a reality. Despite the hope for a launch in early 2016, Solonin reportedly said that the outcome will depend largely on the response from Russian authorities – of which Medvedev's on-air response could be the first of a number of criticisms.  Notably, Solonin indicated that the company was developing a kind of user identification system that would complement the digital currency.  QIWI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

42426480,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtEdh,1442430308,Judge Orders LocalBitcoins User to Teach Police on Digital Currency,"A judge has sentenced Florida LocalBitcoins user Pascal Reid to serves 90 days in jail in a ruling that closes a high-profile legal case dating back to February 2014.  Originally charged  with operating an unauthorized money transmission business and with money laundering, Reid plead guilty to a single count of operating as an unlicensed money transmitter. Reid will receive five years probation and must provide informational assistance to law enforcement and financial entities about bitcoin and digital currencies.  As part of the deal, Reid has been tasked with completing ""no less than 20 trainings"" on digital currency and cybercrime, to be organized by Detective Ricardo Arias of the City of Miami Beach Police Department.  Reid is also required to make himself available to the Miami Beach Police Department, the US Secret Service and the Miami Electronic Crimes Task Force as needed for the development of the sessions.  Attorney Ron Lowy, of Miami-based law firm Lowy and Cook PA, told CoinDesk that he and his client are ""very pleased with the outcome"".  Lowy told CoinDesk:  ""Pascal [Reid] was facing years in prison. But, I think the government has come to the conclusion that Pascal never intended to do anything dishonest.""  Reid was originally arrested alongside Michell Abner Espinoza during a sting operation in which an undercover agent sought to exchange $30,000 for bitcoin in an effort to purchase stolen credit cards.  Both men were initially charged under anti-money laundering statutes, which prohibit exchanges of more than $10,000, and money transmission law that limits residents from conducting personal transactions involving currency or payment instruments to $20,000 annually.  Reid will also be credited for past jail time served from 7th February, 2014, to 14th March, 2014, and be required to pay back $500 in legal fees incurred by the state.  Founded in 2012, LocalBitcoins is a peer-to-peer bitcoin exchange service based in Finland.  Training sessions  Due to its status as one of the first cases of its kind, the Bitcoin Foundation had filed a motion in August of last year arguing that Florida Statute 560.125 should be applied in Reid's case as he was an individual, not a corporate entity.  When asked about possible precedent established by the now-concluded case, Lowy suggested that, since an agreement was reached out of court, it's unlikely to have any impact future.  ""We have to recognize that an appellate court has not ruled that bitcoin meets the definition of something under the money transfer statute. The risk of a ruling would result in Pascal receiving a more severe sentence,"" he explained.  Lowy indicated that he believes this event would be more likely in future cases, as he believes law enforcement will not continue to enlist those arrested in opportunities like law enforcement training sessions.  ""I think they recognize that they wanted to extend a warning to the bitcoin community to be wary of who you do business with and they have sent the message they wanted to send,"" he continued.  According to Lowy, training sessions were included in the final punishment at the request of both Arias and Katherine Rundle, the state attorney for Miami-Dade County, Florida.  Reid did not respond directly to requests for comment as of press time.

42426492,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtErh,1442428306,IBM Developing New Blockchain Smart Contract System,"IBM is working on a new blockchain project for smart contract creation.  The Wall Street Journal reports the company’s research arm is using the basic bitcoin codebase to create a new blockchain system that will eventually be released as open-source software.  IBM said that “dozens” of employees are involved in the initiative, and that the project is distinct from ADEPT, a proof-of-concept for the Internet of Things unveiled earlier this year.  The Journal spoke with IBM research senior vice president Arvind Krishna, who told the newspaper that the company’s blockchain system won’t have an internal currency and will be designed to ""ensure that contract details remain private"" while making it easier for companies to ""embed business rules"" into smart contracts.  One example given was that the software could automatically pay for a package upon delivery.  Krishna said in an interview that the project could result in broader financial access for the unbanked, telling the Journal:  “I want to extend banking to the 3.2 billion people who are going to come into the middle class over the next 15 years. So, I need a much lower cost of keeping a ledger. Blockchain offers some intriguing possibilities there.”  A representative for IBM was not immediately available for comment.

42426484,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtEfh,1442422204,Bitcoin Startup BitPagos Acquires Argentinian Exchange Unisend,"BitPagos has acquired Unisend Argentina, the country's first order-book exchange, as part of an undisclosed deal for cash and equity.  The announcement  follows the sale of the exchange subsidiary Unisend Mexico, and BitPagos' $1.18m funding round finalized last September.  CEO Sebastian Serrano explained that the acquisition will provide BitPagos with a third product offering to complement its existing payment processing service and Ripio, its wallet and brokerage offering.  Serrano told CoinDesk:  ""We want to build the access to bitcoin across Latin America and we thought that part of building that access is building liquidity. It was the next step to start exposing the liquidity generated by merchant services and the consumer side to the market.""  Serrano said the exchange will also help BitPagos market the liquidity it receives from its bitcoin-accepting merchants. Additionally, while Unisend has faced issues with Argentinean banks in the past, Serrano suggested the service is unlikely to experience interruptions  The exchange service is currently operating under the Unisend branding, with the service charging 2% for deposit and 0.6% for trades.  Members of the Unisend leadership, Serrano said, will move on to other ventures following the sale.

42426478,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtEbh,1442402209,California's Bitcoin Bill Shelved by State Senator,"California's AB-1326 bill, which attempted to regulate virtual currency businesses, is no longer active, thanks to a state senator.  The controversial bill, penned by Assemblyman Matt Dababneh, was ordered to become an inactive file at the request of Senator Mitchell on 9th September.  According to definitions by the Californian government, the bill is now ""dormant or dead"" but can potentially be re-activated by its author at a later date.  Colin Gallagher, chair of the Bitcoin Foundation Education Committee, commented on the bill's statushttps://www.notehub.org/2015/9/16/help-defeat-californias-proposed-version:  ""While we should remain vigilant (the California legislature reconvenes on Jan. 4, 2016, and could attempt to take up the bill again), this is a victory we should celebrate. California should not be allowed to fall prey to the same blunders that have cast New York in a financial stone age, and we deserve the freedom to be innovators (without state sanction) both in the making of new decentralised systems as well as in our daily actions and explorations of new systems.""  He continued: ""Had this bill passed the Legislature and been signed by the Governor, it would have criminalised startups and any users who donate virtual currency, as well as making oppressive permitting requirements standard in California for literally every use case not expressly exempted by the law.""  A controversial bill  Similar to New York's BitLicense, which famously divided the bitcoin scene, Dababneh's bill has also proved somewhat controversial.  The bill was opposed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), which claimed it threatened the future of digital currency experimentation and innovation in California.  EFF's criticism drew a response from Dababneh, who at the time said the EFF had ""little expertise in the area of financial regulation"".  Dababneh's bill, however, also drew support from industry bodies such as Coin Center.  In a letter  to Senator Marty Block, Jerry Brito, executive director, argued the bill would ""create a smart licensing regime for virtual currency businesses"".

42426482,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtEhh,1442368790,US State Bank Supervisors Publish Final Model Regulation,"The US Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) has released the final version of its model regulatory framework for digital currencies.  The organization, comprised of representatives from state-level banking regulatory bodies, released an initial draft version of its proposed digital currency regulations in December. The draft drew from comments made during a subsequent two-month comment period in which both the digital currency ecosystem as well as financial incumbents were able to weigh in on the proposal.  While the framework is only a recommendation – state bank regulators can use it as a basis or to craft rules for the technology – it’s publication will likely play a role in how US states move toward finalizing their approaches to overseeing activities that involve digital currency.  The group recommended that companies involved with third-party exchange or transmission of digital currencies, as well as “services that facilitate the third-party exchange, storage and/or transmission of virtual currency (e.g. wallets, vaults, kiosks, merchant-acquirers, and payment processors)” should fall under the oversight of state bank regulators.  The group wrote:  “It is CSBS policy that entities performing activities involving third-party control of virtual currency should be subject to state licensure and supervision like an entity performing such activities with fiat currencies. Accordingly, activities involving fiat currencies that are otherwise subject to state laws should be covered if undertaken using virtual currency.  The text released by the CSBS also included changes to its initial proposal related to permitted types of investment, anti-money laundering compliance, record keeping, supervision and crisis management.  The latest releasehttps://www.csbs.org/news/press-releases/pr2015/Pages/PR091515.aspx  also offers insight into the responses the CSBS received as well as how changes were made to the previous version of the framework.  Definition for 'virtual currency'  The text includes the organization's definition of a ""virtual currency"" for use by state regulators, which focuses on the unit of account itself rather than the software enabling its use.  The finalized definition reads:  “Virtual Currency is a digital representation of value used as a medium of exchange, a unit of account or a store of value, but does not have legal tender status as recognized by the United States Government. Virtual Currency does not include the software or protocols governing the transfer of the digital representation of value. Virtual Currency does not include stored value redeemable exclusively in goods or services limited to transactions involving a defined merchant, such as rewards programs.”  The CSBS noted that one commenter said regulators should adopt common language for this definition ""rather than engaging in haphazard reinterpretation of existing laws"".  Additional proposals  The framework includes recommendations for a nationwide data sharing system based on the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System, a network used for financial institution licensing.  The American Bankers Association  indicated its support for this approach earlier this year, and according to the CSBS, several unidentified companies in the digital currency space have voiced support for the proposal.  The CSBS stated:  “...the Framework recommends the use of a robust licensing system which supports regulators’ ability to share information in real time or close to real time and offers the potential of streamlining all technical aspects of licensing, including application processing, background check processing, reporting and complaint management.”  The group said that it had altered its previous call for third-party cybersecurity audits to allow for flexibility at the discretion of state regulators.  “CSBS originally drafted a cybersecurity audit requirement, including a provision that the audit be performed by a third party. CSBS recognizes this can be costly and potentially premature for startups. CSBS also recognizes a third party audit is important for riskier institutions. Accordingly, the final framework was modified to provide more flexibility,” the group wrote.  Now, the model suggests that regulators decide on a case-by-case basis whether a third party audit is required or if an internal audit prepared by the licensee would be sufficient.  The CSBS also indicated that it had received support from comment submitters for a regulatory “onramp” that would allow certain entities to receive provisional approval, an approach adopted by New York in its BitLicense framework.  In its final regulation model, the CSBS declined to include such language, stating that “state regulators understand the argument in favor of legal and regulatory incubation”.
