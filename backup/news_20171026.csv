The firm plans to have as much as $100 million raised by the end of the first quarter of 2018, representatives said in an email. Multicoin, which revealed its initial commitments today, outlined seven different investment focuses to begin with, ranging from storing value to decentralized prediction markets.  In statements, the fund sought to differentiate itself from traditional fund efforts, stating that while it may resemble a hedge fund on the surface, Multicoin is relying on a technology-driven methodology for identifying token prospects.  Kyle Samani, managing partner, said of the effort:  ""We invest in tokens, not companies, and tokens, unlike companies, require new tools to operate at scale. You can't just carbon-copy the VC model and apply it to tokens or leave $300+ million on some exchange less than a year old.""  The company has been building its own security technology for the last year in order to make sure that investor funds won't be lost. Its security approach is based on three pillars: redundancy, cold storage and multi-signature. None of the private keys ever touch the internet, multiple private keys must sign a transaction to use Multicoin assets and there are copies of each private key stored in secure locations around the world.  ""We like to say that the way we secure our keys is akin to the way the government secures the nuclear codes,"" Tushar Jain, managing partner, said of the fund's measures.  Among the firm's advisors is David Johnston, the co-founder of blockchain startup Factom. Accredited investors can participate with a minimum investment of $100,000, according to the firm. The fund charges a two percent management fee and 20 percent carried interest.

Food Giant Cargill Launches Blockchain Tracking Pilot,"American agricultural conglomerate Cargill is testing a blockchain platform to track the provenance of turkey products.  Launched ahead of this year's Thanksgiving celebration, Cargill's Honeysuckle White brand will utilize the tech, according to statements. The company added that turkeys that are set to be tracked will be primarily sold in Texas.  Farms within Cargill's network will use a blockchain-based system that lets consumers find information about the turkeys, including photos of them where they were raised as well as comments from the farmers themselves.  When a customer purchases a turkey, a label on the packaging will include a code, which the customer can then enter on the Honeysuckle White website.  Representative Deborah Socha said in a statement:  ""We know consumers are looking beyond farm-to-table marketing promises to better understand where their food comes from and how it is produced. That’s why the Honeysuckle White brand is the first and only major turkey brand to pilot a blockchain-based solution for traceable turkey.""  Cargill is not the first food supplier to use a blockchain system to track its products. China-based ZhongAn Technology announced a similar system in June to track chickens in the world’s most populous nation.  ZhongAn’s platform will help it track the chickens over their lifetimes. Unlike Cargill, the company plans to track chickens on an individual level using sensors attached to the birds themselves.

Revealed yesterday in an email posted to the project's mailing list, Bloq co-founder and CEO Jeff Garzik said he expects the planned hard fork, aimed at compelling the network to embrace a 2MB transaction block size, will take place sometime in the middle of next month.  Long planned, the news perhaps shouldn't be a surprise. Despite ample backlash over the project, those involved have long emphasized they believe they have the necessary support to enact the change.  Garzik wrote:  ""To state the obvious, everything is still full steam ahead for Segwit2x upgrade in mid-November.""  As previously detailed by CoinDesk, Segwit2x is a scaling solution backed by a number of companies in the industry as well as a segment of the mining sector. Proponents say the effort will enable higher transaction throughput, building on the introduction of SegWit in August.  Although supported by some well-known startups, the initiative itself is contentious partly because it could lead to two competing variations of the bitcoin blockchain, each governed by different developer teams. This has sparked disagreements as to which network split will constitute ""bitcoin"" (versus another name or price ticker) in the wake of the fork.  Drama ensues  Still, even this simple update wasn't without drama.  The message, which follows a status report in August, details how Segwit2x will run on a dated version of Bitcoin Core software. Garzik wrote that this decision stems from ""instability and bugs"" in newer versions, and he quickly moved to fan the flames of the debate.  Taking aim at the project's open-source developer group, he specified: ""Core's bugs, not ours.""  Elaborating on Twitter, Garzik said he became aware of the bugs from following ""the stream of bug reports and fixes"" on the cryptocurrency's Github.  The statements have sparked controversy across social media, with many pointing to what seems to be an absence of such problems in the software.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which acted as organizer for the SegWit2x proposal and has an ownership stake in Bloq.

42428007,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL59Th,1509039017,'A Real Bubble': Billionaire Warren Buffett Doubles Down on Bitcoin Doubt,"Billionaire investor Warren Buffett has joined the ranks of those who believe the market for bitcoin is in bubble territory.  According to MarketWatch  , Buffett touched on the subject during an annual question-and-answer session held in Omaha earlier this month. While Buffett focused on a range of topics, he honed in on the cryptocurrency market during his remarks.  ""People get excited from big price movements, and Wall Street accommodates,"" he was quoted as saying. Describing bitcoin as a ""real bubble,"" according to the publication, Buffett also criticized the idea of applying a value to bitcoin.  He told attendees:  ""You can’t value bitcoin because it’s not a value-producing asset.""  Buffett's comments came amidst a significant month for bitcoin's price, according to CoinDesk data. After fluctuating around $4,300 at the beginning of October, the price surged to more than $6,100 less than a week ago.  That Buffett would take a harsh stance toward bitcoin is perhaps unsurprising, given that, in 2014, he advocated that investors stay away from bitcoin entirely.  ""It's a mirage basically,"" he was quoted as saying at the time.  Nor is Buffett the only market observer to issue remarks around the market's recent developments. Earlier this week, Saudi Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal said that he expects bitcoin to fail.  Others, however, have adopted a different approach. On Oct. 24, New York University's ""Dean of Valuation,"" Aswath Damodaran, argued that bitcoin is a true currency and not a fraud in a new blog post.

At press time, the litecoin-US dollar (LTC/USD) exchange rate is $56 across global exchanges. As per CoinMarketCap, the cryptocurrency has gained 2.34 percent in the last 24 hours. Week-on-week, LTC is down 6.69 percent, while on a monthly basis, it's up 5.13 percent.  But while perhaps those moves might not qualify as volatile in the cryptocurrency market, it appears litecoin is benefiting from a rotation of funds from bitcoin. A larger trend this week following the launch of bitcoin gold (BTG) trading on exchanges, the move is thus far keeping litecoin prices above the 100-day moving average.  Still, a move to $60 looks unlikely – and anemic trading volumes could be the reason.  Litecoin volume chart  The above chart shows:  Daily volumes have dropped below 200 million, which is well below the average since April (400 million).  The odds are high litecoin falls below 100-day support as volumes remain weak, furthermore, fiat money is again being rotated into bitcoin. Hence, it will be difficult for alternative coins to hold their own.  The price action analysis also tilts slightly in favor of the bears.  Daily chart  The above chart shows:  Expanding channel  Money flow index (MFI) is losing altitude  Prices trapped between the 50-day MA ($56.58) and 100-day MA ($53.95).  The MFI is a momentum oscillator that can be used to confirm the price action, and a decline in the metric shows a lack of buying pressure despite strong 100-day MA support.  Thus, odds are high that prices could drop to $51.50 (channel support). A violation there would open doors for a sell-off to $45.18 (Sep. 21 low). On the higher side, a move above $60.00 would add credence to the rebound from 100-day MA support and put a Oct. 15 high of $69.59 back in play.

In remarks made on the third day of the Financial Investment Initiative summit in Saudi Arabia, Thiel said that while he is ""skeptical of most [cryptocurrencies],"" he believes bitcoin has a promising future depending on the trajectory it takes, according to CNBC.  Speaking with Fox Business Network anchor Maria Bartiromo, Thiel said that those criticizing bitcoin are ""underestimating [it] especially because ... it's like a reserve form of money, it's like gold, and it's just a store of value. You don't need to use it to make payments.""  He went on to say:  ""If bitcoin ends up being the cyber equivalent of gold it has a great potential left.""  Thiel has previously argued that bitcoin doesn’t work well for payments. Back in 2014, during a Reddit Ask-Me-Anything session, he said that ""the payment system is badly lacking"" and that he wasn't ready to take a more bullish position just yet.  ""I will become more bullish on bitcoin when I see the payment volume of bitcoin really increase,"" he said at the time.  He notably remarked that bitcoin mining – the energy-intensive process by which new transactions are added to a blockchain – is more difficult than gold mining. His comments highlighted the limited issuance of coins encoded in the cryptocurrency's software, as only 21 million bitcoins will be created.  ""Bitcoin is mineable like gold, it's hard to mine, it's actually harder to mine than gold. And so in that sense, it's more constrained,"" he said.

The AMF announced today a two-prong effort around the funding model, a move that comes weeks after the agency's head, Robert Ophele, said that officials were moving quickly to develop regulatory position.  In today's disclosure, the AMF said that it is considering one of several approaches, including an update to existing rules to account for ICOs or entirely new regulations around the use case. Further, the agency said it may issue a best-practices guide for potential organizers. Before it makes its regulatory decision, the AMF is soliciting consultations from the public, with the agency accepting submissions until Dec. 22.  Perhaps more notably, the AMF also unveiled a new program, dubbed ""UNICORN,"" which is aimed at providing a mechanism for ICO organizers in France to carry out their plans under the agency's guidance.  The AMF said in a translated statement:  ""Called UNICORN (for ""Universal Node to ICO Research & Network""), this one, in parallel of the reflection on the possible tracks of regulation, aims at offering to these carriers of projects a frame allowing the development of their operations and to ensure the protection of actors and investors wishing to participate.""  The effort is also, in part, a bid to boost the AMF's institutional knowledge around the tech. The agency said that it would tap participants to help it ""deepen its legal and economic expertise.""  ""The AMF also intends to encourage academic research on this subject and will publish a first impact analysis of these new forms of financing within one year,"" the agency added.  With the move, France's government appears to have adopted a more accommodative stance toward the blockchain use case, even going as far as to proactively encourage developer teams to get in touch. This approach has recently been seen in countries like Canada, which has given regulatory approval to two ICOs to date.

Like other trials of its kind that have taken place in recent months, the energy firms explored how peer-to-peer trading can facilitate direct sales of power. The idea is the technology could help reduce the costs associated with power distribution intermediaries and provide more transparency to the process.  The test initiative formed part of the ""Enerchain"" initiative, a broader attempt baked by 30 European utility providers. Some of the earlier work was made public in May, according to a Bloomberg report at the time.

We see this not just in China or the Middle East, but in this country, in states that are considered to be free. If you go back in history, there was a lot more concern about privacy on the internet before Facebook.""  For Waterhouse, though, the idea began with a rather personal wake-up call.  Following his departure from Pantera, he said he was seeking ideas in AI and enterprise software, exploring various ideas and inspirations; then, he was hacked and his information exposed.  ""That really woke me up,"" Waterhouse said. ""I was more concerned about surveillance, the idea that we don't have technologies to let people communicate without censorship.""  Investors such as Ryan Zurer, venture partner at Polychain Capital, struck a similar tone, suggesting an expansive use case that is global in scope.  ""Users could be someone in Catalonia who can't access their government websites or someone in the US who wants to make secure transactions without oversight,"" he said.  Still, Waterhouse sees Orchid's token working within these margins, going so far as to suggest large internet applications such as Facebook could eventually become users of the tech to anonymize their own traffic.  A new VPN  While a white paper for the project isn't yet available, those close to the project described the code as a more mature offering in what has been a market defined by quick launches.  Still, the offering is not without similarities to the average ICO. For one, the orchid token (OCT) will be issued on the ethereum blockchain, and like projects such as Blockstack, it will be seeking to change internet behaviors.  However, unlike other decentralized internet attempts, Waterhouse said Orchid would offer software for the exit and routing nodes that form the network itself, marking a differentiator, in that the underlying infrastructure wouldn't be altered.  In practice, users wouls use the internet as they do today, but would exchange tokens with these nodes as a means of protecting their information from internet service providers (ISPs) and carriers, or providing it to an intermediary like a virtual private network (VPN).  The idea is users would purchase tokens from an exchange or earn them by dedicating available bandwidth toward running a node on the network, at which point they would be sent to a wallet application. When users wanted to hide or shield their activity, they could then spend tokens as part of their activities.  ""You're paying to access the relay nodes and [to] encrypt and anonymize the traffic, and all the way along the chain, the nodes are being paid,"" he continued.  This doesn't mean that ISPs and carriers wouldn't see the traffic, according to Waterhouse, but that it would utilize techniques to make orchid protocol traffic indistinguishable from typical internet traffic.  Here, he said the startup will draw on advisors including Gavin Wood, founder and CTO at Parity Technologies, Stanford's Dan Boneh, and Alex Lloyd, managing director of Accelerator Ventures.  Ultimately, though, he predicts the technology will be strong enough to prevent governments from compromising the network, hinting at fears that states have infiltrated the Tor network.  ""China would be forced to shut down outside internet, or allow our system to work,"" he said. ""They're not going to be able to tell the difference.""  Free riders  But ultimately, Waterhouse said, the orchid protocol will derive value from being flexible within the boundaries of the current internet.  For example, as opposed to restructuring it, as proposed by other decentralized technology enthusiasts, he described the protocol as a layer that would ""sit on top of the internet."" This wouldn't stop users from accepting cookies or engaging in voluntary behaviors that might indicate their information.  Looking ahead, however, it will be some time before users get to test out the software, now in alpha.  As Orchid raised the funds via a SAFT (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens), a legal tool created as a means of funding the future creation of tokens, the team is just now gearing up for a potential market sale. But, a beta launch is not expected until early 2018.  More set in stone are Orchid's long-term revenue plans, which according to Waterhouse, won't include seeking to extract payment from the protocol.  Ultimately, Waterhouse believes that Orchid will be best incentivized by ensuring the protocol's long-term utility by holding a stake in its token supply, which would in turn also ease the end-user experience.  He concluded:  ""That's the model for the investors and the company, we hold tokens.""  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Blockstack.

42428009,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL59bh,1509020416,"Highs on the Radar? Bitcoin Retakes $5,800 as Prices Edge Up","Bitcoin is trading on a firmer note today.  At press time, the bitcoin-U.S. dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate is $5,840 across global exchanges. As per CoinMarketCap, the cryptocurrency has witnessed a 6 percent increase in the last 24 hours.  After topping out at record highs above $6,100 on earlier this week, bitcoin met a wave of sell offers as investors switched to alternative cryptocurrencies (most likely using fresh funds awarded by exchanges after a new fork).  However, while the new bitcoin gold (BTG) saw big declines on its first day of trading, bitcoin (BTC) turned higher from a low of $5,376, indicating fiat money could be entering the BTC market, resulting in higher prices.  Rumors are also doing the rounds that Amazon could announce that it will start accepting bitcoin at its quarterly earnings today. However, it should be noted that this seems highly unlikely, as the rumor (spread by an investor newsletter) lacks credibility and has been debunked numerous times in the recent past.  Looking ahead, it's possible bitcoin will capitalize on the sharp recovery and revisit record highs.  Price action analysis suggests the odds of the upwards move would improve if prices hold above $5,867.  Daily chart: BTC needs to hold above $5,867  The above chart shows:  Strong resistance at $5,867 (Oct. 13 high)  Bearish price-relative strength index (RSI) and price-money flow index (MFI) is still intact  Another higher low established at $5,376.  View: 4-hour chart  A break above $5,867 would add credence to Wednesday's sharp recovery from the low of $5,376 and would open the doors for re-test of $6,050 levels.  Bearish scenario: Failure to hold above the descending trend line hurdle followed by a drop below $5,700 would open doors for a sell-off to $5,400 (support of the blue dotted rising trend line seen on the daily chart).  It's also worth noting that a drop below $5,700 would result in a bearish 5-day MA (moving average) and 10-day MA crossover.

42427992,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL58zh,1509018306,Pantera Leads $5 Million Investment in Video Streaming Token Pre-Sale,"A blockchain project aimed at bootstrapping a more equitable video streaming economy has raised $5 million in the pre-sale of a new token.  Announced today, Stream's fundraising was led by Pantera Capital, with other participants including Blockchain Partners Korea, Coinfund, Fenbushi Capital, FBG Capital, Inblockchain and ZhenFund. Individual investors such as Stellar founder Jed McCaleb and TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington also contributed.  As is perhaps supported by the list of notable industry investors, Stream believes it can succeed where other similar ventures have failed.  Whereas past projects attempting to create blockchain-based video networks used existing networks, mainly bitcoin and ethereum, Stream CEO Ben Yu said he believes these failed as any value accrued by the application was not paid back to users.  ""You lose out on the ability to capture the wealth accumulated by the economy,"" he said.  In the case of projects, he argued that those who shared and exchanged video content were unable to reap the economic benefits of an expanding network, a roadblock he believes Stream's token can overcome.  In this way, Yu said his project is simply taking a viable idea and applying a key ingredient: timing.  Yu told CoinDesk:  ""If you're trying to create a consumer killer application, you have to find something that has a similar flow. Live streaming platforms already feature currencies, but they're doing it with arbitrary centralized cryptocurrencies.""  As such, Yu's refrain may be familiar for those who have been following the space – that content creators are being unfairly compensated by the large video sharing services, such as YouTube, Vimeo and the like.  The goal then, Yu explained, is to move the video uploading and sharing capabilities to the protocol layer, thereby enabling a wider variety of services to access a reservoir of available content and compete on user experience and design.  Yu said this will change aspects of the video economy he views as unfavorable, such as the idea that today's content creators often have to monetize via sponsorships.  ""YouTube is a 100 billion [dollar] company. All these companies, Twitch, they are billion-dollar companies. We think there's a better way around this,"" Yu said.  Future plans  Looking ahead, Stream is preparing a more formal token sale in November, one in which it will sell 33 percent of its token supply.  However, on day one, Yu and COO Simar Mangat said the company won't immediately benefit from the proceeds. Rather, funds will be put aside in a smart contract, and released by self-executing code over time as a means of funding continued operations.  ""We'll get tokens over four years, but we start out with no tokens,"" Mangat said.  Opening to the public sooner will be a Chrome extension that the company believes will enable early adopters to get a taste of its strategy by exchanging tokens.  More long term, Yu said, will be building the file distribution and storage networks necessary for a true decentralized video marketplace.  Yu concluded:  ""That's going to be one to five years out, but that doesn't mean we can't create something with imminent value.""

Raptor Group, founded by billionaire businessman Jim Pallotta, has invested in major firms such as Uber, as well as blockchain industry startups like Paxos, among others.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, Templum (along with its affiliate broker-dealer Liquid M Capital) is seeking to launch a platform for the trading of blockchain-based tokens that are considered securities.  Utilizing a so-called alternative trading system (ATS) that is subject to regulation from agencies like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the startup is hoping to develop both primary and secondary markets around such tokens.  ""ICOs offer innovative organizations an efficient alternative for raising capital. However, ICOs in their current form can be highly risky for issuers and investors.

42400550,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcK1au,1508997606,Did Ethereum ICO? Founder Joe Lubin Gives Uncertain Answer,"The early history of ethereum was up for discussion at an event debuting a new Quartz and Retro Report video series highlighting the potential of blockchain this week.  There, Quartz editor-in-chief Kevin Delaney asked one of the protocol's co-inventors, Joseph Lubin: When ether first went on the open market in 2015, ""Was that technically an ICO?""  Perhaps a nod to the increasing scrutiny around the funding model, which has raised more than $2 billion for early-stage projects, Lubin dodged the question.  ""We don't like the term ICO. It sounds too much like 'IPO,'"" he explained.  The founder of blockchain development firm ConsenSys, Lubin went on to note that the use of the term (and similar investment language) tends to attract attention from regulators.  Yet, the conversation, taking place at Retro Report's offices in New York, as a preview of a series of films the two news organizations have produced together, was broader in scope.  Elsewhere, Lubin acknowledged that there’s a lot of speculators in the cryptocurrency market, but that his company is trying not to get caught up in that aspect of the industry.  Lubin told Delaney:  ""We are just building the system. We are doing our best not to think about price.""  That said, he also argued that the interest in the price of crypto assets does draw users into the ecosystem. ""I keep getting asked if it’s a bubble,"" he said. ""Of course it's a bubble.""  Still, he hopes there will be many more bubbles, each of which will bring in a fresh new crop of users who will find value in blockchain technology, whatever happens to the price of the various available currencies.  That wasn't the only provocative statement Lubin made. Delaney also asked whether some of the most notable protocols needed to be better designed to prevent theft of people's assets.  ""Bitcoin and ethereum are agnostic when it comes to theft,"" Lubin said. ""Theft is a social construct."" In other words, he argued theft needs to be addressed in the applications on top of cryptocurrency, not in the protocol layer itself.  Values, however, are not something to be installed in a money supply.  ""I'm not going to warn people about what values they should carry around with them,"" Lubin said.

42400541,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcK1U1,1508985060,What's the Price of Bitcoin Gold? Crypto Traders Still Aren't Sure,"From $0 to $2,900 – and seemingly everywhere in between.  Bitcoin gold  , a new fork of the bitcoin software, may not have been officially launched (or distributed to users), but that isn't stopping the cryptocurrency markets from seeking to determine its potential value (or profiting from its eventual existence).  In an interesting twist on a typical distribution, a number of exchanges are now listing a token that represents a claim on the future delivery of bitcoin gold (in advance of it becoming available to all bitcoin users). Ahead of that event, however, traders are seeking to value the asset, which proposes an alternative to the difficulty of competing for rewards on bitcoin's mining network.  Still, it's safe to say there's disagreement so far.  In interview, analysts expressed a reservation about bitcoin gold, both when speaking about its developer team, and when characterizing the protocol's potential market opportunity.  Safiri Felix, a researcher at financial publisher Empiricus, for example, believes that while bitcoin gold is likely to encourage others to clone bitcoin's blockchain, and thus capitalize on the potential to appeal to its expansive user base, he sees this trajectory as limited.  Felix told CoinDesk:  ""I think that forks and airdrops as a trend to launch new tokens [will continue], aiming to get an instant user base. Best case scenario, bitcoin gold is a potential contender for litecoin.""  Indeed, most industry observers surveyed don't expect the project to compete with bitcoin or bitcoin cash, predicting its market capitalization would likely be similar to less valuable networks.  This belief seems reflected on exchanges, where BTG tokens traded for a high of $2,900 on Bitfinex, before dropping 96.64 percent to $97 on Tuesday. By Wednesday, prices stabilized around $137 atpress time, though order books are heavy with sell ordershttps://www.bitfinex.com/order_book/btgusd in available markets.  At current prices, the value of all bitcoin gold (once released) would be worth a mere 43 percent of BCH and 2 percent of BTC. As such, it seems unlikely to surpass the value of those currencies in the immediate future.  Likewise, exchange interest also seems subdued. Currently, only a handful of exchanges, Bitfinex, HitBTC, Yobit, Bleutrade, Bitstar and Coinnest, support BTG/BTC and BTG/USD trading pairs.  Developer concerns  Of course, the biggest question mark for those surveyed was whether the tokens will actually be delivered by those behind the project.  Already controversial is that the team behind bitcoin gold intends to set aside a certain amount of the cryptocurrency to fund its future development, as part of what's called a ""pre-mine."" Indeed, Felix was quick to note that the bitcoin gold team has no existing track record in the industry.  ""It's natural to dismiss their ability to deliver quality code,"" he said.  Long-time industry entrepreneur and director of business and community at cryptocurrency wallet provider Jaxx, Charlie Shrem, also cited the decision to set aside funds as a suspicious one, though not one that inherently denotes any wrongdoing.  ""[It] seems like an attempt to replicate bitcoin cash and give the developers a nice premine,"" he said.  Overall, his remarks pointed to the idea that the low price of bitcoin gold as compared to bitcoin and bitcoin cash may be reflective of the possibility the funds never actually arrive.  Long-term potential  As for what that means for those considering how to handle their holdings, it's worth noting that such market shifts are common when it comes to the price determination of a new asset.  For instance, bitcoin cash (BCH) – which forked off bitcoin in August – traded for highs of nearly $1,000 before dropping to trade between $300 to $400 in its first month. Likewise, at points, zcash traded for millions of dollars per token (though that was due to issues with its distribution).  But, it's still the question of the protocol's ultimate value proposition that seems most pertinent.  Shrem went so far as to forecast that it's possible bitcoin gold could inspire cryptocurrency hobbyists to begin securing the protocol with older mining equipment, and that this could possibly jumpstart value creation, potentially leading to utility.  He noted that while older GPUs could be used to mine ether – the cryptocurrency of the ethereum network – doing so would mean a reduced chance of rewards given its existing competition.  Of course, others were more outright dismissive. Tim Enneking, managing director at hedge fund Crypto Asset Management, believes bitcoin gold proves fork currencies will likely have diminishing returns from here on out.
