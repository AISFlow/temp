42412150,KEYN3b06rsSCg2kKkMIgwJ,1634344062,"Ransomware Payments in 2021 Already Dwarf Last Year’s Total, FinCEN Reports","Payments tied to ransomware attacks in 2021 are already exceeding 2020′s total, the U.S. government’s financial crimes watchdog said Friday.  Exchanges and other financial institutions reported more than $590 million in payments tied to ransomware attacks, including cryptocurrency payments, to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) in the first half of 2021, outstripping a 2020 total of just $416 million. It was not immediately clear what amount of this total was comprised specifically of cryptocurrency transactions, versus more traditional payment methods.  A Treasury Department press release said attackers are “increasingly requesting payments in Anonymity-Enhanced Cryptocurrencies” such as monero.  Attackers are also using mixers, decentralized exchanges, fresh wallet addresses and hopping between chains more as an effort to evade law enforcement officials, the release said.  Crypto SARs  FinCEN tied the reported amounts, which came through Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs), to a total of $5.2 billion in transactions that may be “potentially tied” to ransomware payments, according to Treasury Department official Todd Conklin.  Last year, former FinCEN Director Kenneth Blanco told CoinDesk that less than 1% of SARs filed to the agency mentioned crypto, though he did not share any monetary figures tied to these reports.  Conklin, counselor to Deputy Treasury Secretary Adewale Adeyemo, told TRM Labs’ Ari Redbord that the announcement is part of the Treasury Department’s broader push against ransomware. Ransomware, where an attacker encrypts a victim’s computer or network until the victim pays a ransom for a decryption key, has been employed in several high-profile attacks in 2021, disrupting critical supply-chain vendors like a gas transport firm and a meat processing plant.  Read more: Here’s What We Know About Suex, the First Crypto Firm Sanctioned by US  Last month, the Treasury Department added an over-the-counter crypto trading platform to a global blacklist for the first time in its ongoing fight to tamp down on ransomware attacks and payments.  “We have seen an aggressive sustained effort on ransomware the last few weeks from the administration that started even before the Suex designation,” Redbord, a former Treasury official, told CoinDesk in a statement. “We are rightfully seeing the most focus on hardening cyber defenses, and when it comes to crypto, we are seeing Treasury, DOJ and others target the illicit parts of the crypto ecosystem rather than the overwhelmingly compliant industry itself.”  Remaining compliant  In addition to the FinCEN findings, the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) published a “sanctions compliance guidance” brochure for crypto businesses, detailing the requirements for U.S. persons and entities that come into contact with “blocked” cryptocurrencies.  “Once a U.S. person determines that they hold virtual currency that is required to be blocked pursuant to OFAC’s regulations, the U.S. person must deny all parties access to that virtual currency, ensure that they comply with OFAC regulations related to the holding and reporting of blocked assets, and implement controls that align with a risk-based approach,” the brochure said.  The document includes recommended best practices and controls that crypto industry businesses can implement to remain in compliance with federal law.  “We are going to continue to target the illicit parts of the crypto ecosystem while also ensuring we are helping to bolster compliance regimes across the entire ecosystem,” Conklin said. “Fundamentally, though, we see ransomware as a cybersecurity issue. It gets framed in many areas as a crypto currency issue, but just attacking the crypto ecosystem is not going to fix the core problem, which is cyber vulnerabilities across multiple sectors.”  Heightened focus  OFAC said in a press release that cryptocurrencies are being increasingly used for ransomware payments, though it also did not specify a breakdown between fiat transactions and cryptocurrency transactions.

The fund initially sought to raise $50 million, but strong interest from investors prompted Tribe Capital to raise the total, according to the sources.  San Francisco-based Tribe Capital’s fund will focus strictly on the crypto sector, taking long positions in early-stage projects, SAFTs (simple agreements for future tokens, a type of investment agreement that developers use to work with investors), yield farming, treasury buys and mining.  The fund will make 75% of its investments in U.S. projects and 25% internationally.  Tribe Capital has invested about 20% of its assets in cryptocurrency projects, according to the sources. Its portfolio includes an investment in Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk’s parent company, and last month, the firm participated in a $10 million Series A funding round for Floating Point Group, which offers custody and algorithmic trading services to institutional investors.  Arjun Sethi, Tribe Capital’s co-founder, and Jared Madfes, a partner at the firm, will manage the crypto fund.

42412158,KEYN3b06rsSCg2kKkMIhVv,1634343038,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Reaches $61K as SEC’s ETF Deadline Nears,"Bitcoin rose to $61,000 Friday as traders eagerly anticipate approval of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S. Enthusiasm for such an approval contributed to a near 6% jump in BTC’s price over the past 24 hours.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reviewing around 40 bitcoin ETF product filings and has multiple decision deadlines to make a decision on futures-linked ETFs starting next week. According to Bloomberg, the regulator is expected to approve at least some of them, clearing the way for an anticipated hike in trading to begin.  An exchange-traded fund is a type of security that tracks an index, sector or other asset and can be purchased or sold on a stock exchange like a regular stock. However, what the SEC is likely to approve is a bitcoin futures ETF based on futures traded on the CME exchange. The investor would not hold bitcoin directly, but there are still risks.  “Markets remain healthy, and we expect the rotation to continue as the speculation over a bitcoin ETF intensifies,” crypto investment firm StackFunds wrote in a Wednesday report.  Latest prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $61,324, +6.2%  Ether (ETH): $3,840, +1.5%  S&P 500: +0.8%  Gold: $1,768, -1.6%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.57%  For now, technical analysis suggests bitcoin is at a critical point.  “Traders previously suggested that for bitcoin to enter an extremely bullish phase and go parabolic it would need to break the $59K-$60K level,” Will Morris, trader at the U.K.-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  Katie Stockton, managing partner at Fairlead Strategieshttp://strategies.squarespace.com/, a technical research firm, wrote that immediate signs of upside price exhaustion still appear on the charts. However, an open above $58,859 on Saturday could invalidate the short-term exhaustion signal, identified using DeMARK indicators.  “If it is stopped out, we would expect a speedy follow-through to final resistance near $65K, and if the signal is left intact the implications would be for another week of consolidation,” Stockton wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  Bitcoin ETF probabilities  The SEC does not need to take formal action to approve the filings. Under federal law, applications can become effective if the SEC allows a mandated deadline to pass by without requesting changes or directing the aspiring issuer to pull the filing, wrote CoinDesk’s Danny Nelson.  The table below shows the odds of select ETF filings receiving SEC approval first, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.  “If a futures-based ETF gets the green light, the door will finally open to retirement funds with assets in the trillions [of dollars], creating very favorable conditions for spot BTC to continue rallying,” Coinbase wrote in a newsletter to institutional clients on Friday.  “The next factor to consider is the time to launch and expected take-up from these ETFs. Sources close to the ETF business say that the time from approval to launch could be less than seven days,” Coinbase wrote, which means ETF buying by investors could occur in late October.  Generally, analysts anticipate more ETF products to be approved in the near future.  “Many in the investment products industry will now focus their attention on the ultimate ETF goal of bringing a spot-based product to market, a more cost-effective solution for consumers,” FundStrat, a global advisory firm, wrote in a Friday report.  Bitcoin and stocks rise  The recent rise in bitcoin’s price also coincided with stabilization in equity markets. After a few days of decoupling from BTC’s rally, the S&P 500 has finally gained a footing, suggesting that investors’ appetite for risk remains strong.  The chart below shows the 90-day correlation between bitcoin and the S&P 500, which has risen over the past few months.  Altcoin roundup  CFTC fines Tether and Bitfinex $42.5 million for “untrue or misleading” claims: The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) fined sister companies Bitfinex and Tether more than $42 million on allegations the USDT stablecoin was not fully backed at all times and that Bitfinex violated a previous agency order, reported CoinDesk’s Nikhilesh De. According to a CFTC press release, Tether’s stablecoin was fully backed by reserves for only one-quarter of the time over a 26-month period between 2016 and 2018. Further, Tether commingled reserve funds with the company’s corporate funds and held reserves in non-cash products, the regulator said.  DeFi game PoolTogether launches v4: Popular DeFi no-loss savings game PoolTogether has overhauled its architecture with the launch of its version 4, upgrading its win percentages for users, reported CoinDesk’s Andrew Thurman. PoolTogether’s new architecture allows for greater fractionalization of winnings – upwards of a thousand prizes from an earnings pool – giving smaller depositors a much higher chance of nabbing prizes. “Someone who had $1,000 right now into the USDC prize pool would have a 0.01% chance of winning a prize every week. That’s a less than 1% chance of winning a prize a year,” PoolTogether co-founder Leighton Cusack said. “With the new PoolTogether, someone with $1,000 deposited will have a 10% chance of winning a prize each week.”  NuCypher, Polygon gain as tokens list on South Korean exchange: The Bank of Japan (BoJ) would try to develop a central bank digital currency (CBDC) that can easily coexist with private payment methods, reported CoinDesk’s Jamie Crawley. Seeking “vertical coexistence,” with other payment methods used by the public, a CBDC should be made of “relatively plain, easy-to-cook material,” BoJ Executive Director Shinichi Uchida said on Friday. Uchida added in his speech that the BoJ has “no plans to issue a CBDC at this time,” but that not issuing one would still leave the central bank with the task of building a payment system fit for the future.

42411897,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgwZu,1634342936,What Is a Bitcoin ETF?,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to decide soon on whether to approve bitcoin ETFs.  BlackRock's plan for a bitcoin ETF shocked the crypto and financial realms last year, and spurred other traditional financial firms to file their own applications.  Approval for bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. could, in theory, be a game-changer for bitcoin by bringing in a flood of investment into the original cryptocurrency since ETFs are relatively easy to trade and are available through conventional brokerage accounts.  A bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund, or ETF, lets traders easily gain exposure to the biggest cryptocurrency via traditional brokerage accounts and stock markets, without needing to directly buy or sell the digital asset on a crypto exchange.  They are not authorized in the U.S., though Canada and several European countries allow them. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to decide whether to approve or reject them on Jan. 10, 2024. The U.S. does have something similar: bitcoin futures ETFs, which hold derivatives contracts whose value is tied to bitcoin.  But more direct exposure is not available through ETFs that actually own BTC – technically known as spot bitcoin ETFs. As of January 2024, the SEC is evaluating almost a dozen applications to list those – from would-be issuers including BlackRock and Fidelity as well as Grayscale, which wants to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF – and regulators are widely expected to finally give the green light soon.  Many experts believe U.S. approval could dramatically increase the investor base for bitcoin since bitcoin ETFs can be purchased through traditional investment channels, while also giving comfort to institutional investors who can only invest in regulated products.  What are ETFs?  ETFs are a gigantic part of conventional finance, with many trillions of dollars invested. They trade on exchanges just like stocks, but – instead of conveying an ownership stake in a single company – they represent ownership of a basket of assets. There are ETFs that track the S&P 500, bonds, commodities including gold, and much more.  They're as easy to purchase as a stock. This is why optimists are predicting a flood of investment into bitcoin ETFs.  History of bitcoin ETFs  Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss proposed creating a bitcoin ETF in 2013. Their plan was repeatedly rejected by the SEC. Regulators' rationale was that the bitcoin market is too volatile, lacked sufficient surveillance and was too easily manipulated.  The U.S. got something else in 2017: bitcoin futures contracts. These are primarily for investment professionals, not the mostly retail traders who buy ETFs, but these led to the SEC's 2021 approval of bitcoin futures ETFs.  Meanwhile, for years, Grayscale has offered a product called the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which owns tens of billions of dollars worth of BTC. Like a bitcoin ETF, buying a share of GBTC gives the owner an economic interest in bitcoin. But there are drawbacks. It's not as widely available as an ETF. And, because of the trust's structure, new GBTC shares can be issued but existing ones cannot be canceled, which can cause its price to stray from the value of the bitcoin it holds. Such a supply/demand imbalance occurred in recent years, with GBTC in late 2022 sinking to a 50% discount to its so-called net asset value.  BlackRock's bitcoin ETF, Grayscale's good news  The tide began to shift in June 2023, with the shocking news that BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, wanted to offer a bitcoin ETF in the U.S. Support for the idea from one of the leading names in traditional finance led to enthusiasm that, after a decade of failed attempts, a spot bitcoin ETF might finally arrive in the nation with the largest capital market in the world. Other TradFi firms followed, including Fidelity, Franklin Templeton and Invesco (with support from crypto firm Galaxy), as well as crypto-native firms like Valkyrie and Bitwise.  In August 2023, Grayscale got good news about its attempt to turn the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. A U.S. court ruled that the SEC must reconsider its rejection of Grayscale's application, calling regulators' decision ""arbitrary and capricious.""  Bitcoin's price soared in late 2023 and GBTC's discount to NAV narrowed amid optimism the SEC would approve bitcoin ETFs.  Bitcoin ETF deadline  The SEC is widely expected to announce its decision on whether to approve or reject bitcoin ETFs between Jan. 8-10, 2024. Issuers and regulators have met repeatedly in the run-up to that deadline, leading to a series of revisions to regulatory filings. BlackRock and others have announced key partners, including the firms that will hold the bitcoin in custody for the ETFs as well as the so-called authorized participants tasked with keeping the products trading smoothly.  Bitcoin ETF FAQs  Who can invest in ETFs and how do you trade them?  You don't need to be an accredited investor to purchase ETFs. Anyone can invest in them.  All you need in order to begin investing in ETFs is to set up an online brokerage account or download one of the many mobile trading apps. From there, you'll be able to buy and sell a wide range of ETFs that track a number of different markets.  What are the pros and cons of trading bitcoin ETFs?  While it might seem counterintuitive to invest in a bitcoin ETF rather than buy bitcoin itself, there are a number of advantages to doing it this way, namely:  No need to go through the process of having to store crypto safely yourself.  ETFs are more regulated and bitcoin, which may provide comfort to some investors.  Conventional brokerages have a longer track record than crypto exchanges, which may also mollify skeptics.  There are much clearer tax implications and guidance for traditional financial products than digital assets.  There are, however, disadvantages to investing in a bitcoin ETF as opposed to buying the asset directly:  Crypto markets run 24/7, whereas ETFs can only be purchased when stock exchanges are open, and they are shut on weekends and weekday nights.  It's free to hold your own bitcoin, but ETFs charge management fees.  ETFs require you to trust third-party custodians.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,"Nick Baker, Ollie Leech",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-is-a-bitcoin-etf,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2ac147381d9d124f22406bc337299a2ddb56f90d-889x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42412152,KEYN3b06rsSCg2kKkMIh0l,1634342872,"SEC Approves Bitcoin Futures ETF, Opening Crypto to Wider Investor Base","After years of trial and error by would-be fund sponsors, cryptocurrency investing is finally opening up to the masses with the tacit U.S. approval of a bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund.  The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) greenlighted bitcoin futures ETFs in a first for the industry on Friday, after the regulator’s five commissioners met on the issue. ProShares, which filed for its Bitcoin Strategy ETF this past summer, may be the first to launch next week.  The company filed a post-effective amended prospectus on Oct. 15, stating its filing is expected to launch on Monday, Oct. 18, though the fund may not begin trading immediately.  Proponents of a bitcoin ETF believe the product will be more widely accessible for individuals interested in bitcoin than the actual cryptocurrency by giving investors a regulated alternative to the underlying digital asset. The first product will track bitcoin futures, rather than the price of bitcoin directly, however. SEC Chair Gary Gensler indicated he believes futures-based products might provide stronger investor protections due to the laws under which they operate.  The SEC has, in the past, explicitly rejected bitcoin ETF applications, but it does not need to formally approve one. Under federal law, the SEC can just allow an application to become effective, rather than make a formal announcement.  ‘Encouraging sign’  ETFStore President Nate Geraci told CoinDesk the form is “a step forward” for digital assets and bridging them with the more traditional financial sector. He confirmed that the filing of a post-effective amendment is confirmation of the SEC’s tacit approval.  “It’s an encouraging sign for the future of crypto to see SEC Chairman Gensler get comfortable in helping mainstream investors more easily access bitcoin exposure,” he said in an email. “The availability of a bitcoin ETF will now bring more investors under the crypto tent and facilitate greater education across the space.”  James Seyffart, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, also confirmed to CoinDesk the filing is a sign the fund is launching.  He also anticipates the futures-based ETF launch to act as a bridge to ultimately launching a spot market-based ETF.  Seyffart noted that ProShares’ amended filing removed language about the fund possibly investing in Canadian bitcoin ETFs as a sort of hedge.  “It seems the SEC really did not like that language for whatever reason,” he said. “But they are following standard guidelines and allowing first to file to launch first. So we will be tracking closely how much of a first mover advantage there is here.”  A spokesperson for ProShares referred CoinDesk to the post-effective prospectus.  Long time coming  Industry participants have long sought to launch a bitcoin ETF, with Gemini founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss first seeking an ETF in 2013. The SEC has rejected every previous application to date, and still has yet to weigh in on more than 30 other current applications.  It is likely the SEC will only allow futures ETFs to launch this year, however. Gensler’s comments supporting a futures ETF hint that he will not allow a spot market ETF to launch in the near term.  “I highly doubt the SEC will approve the product this year,” Seyffart said.
