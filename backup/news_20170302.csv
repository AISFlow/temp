42427450,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKXRh,1488485285,The $45-Dollar Question: What's Going On With the Price of Dash?,"UPDATE (2nd March 21:45 BST): This article has been updated with comment from Dash director of finance Ryan Taylor.      Some have called it scam, others a cutting-edge digital currency.  Either way, the price of dash has surged in recent days. The digital currency's price, billed as a faster, more user-oriented bitcoin, is up more than 100% in the past week, reaching a high of close to $60 today, according to CoinMarketCap.com.  Rising as much as 40% yesterday alone, market observers, traders, advocates and critics have taken to social media to give their take on the recent price ramp in a subject that has become a dominating discussion among traders and investors on Twitter.  For those who are new to the subject, dash – originally known as darkcoin prior to its rebranding – has earned its share of supporters and critics in the years since it launched.  During that time, the digital currency’s public-facing image has shifted from one centered more squarely on financial privacy toward one that seeks to highlight its ease of use in online commerce.  But why is this price ramp happening now?  Some have argued that a mixture of exchange integrations and plans for a user experience upgrade (among other technical updates) are behind the speculation that has led to the price increases. In their view, the increase is the culmination of years of development and expansion.  Others are alleging that the price increase is merely the front-end of the kind of pump-and-dump market scheme commonly seen in cryptocurrency markets with lower volumes. Further, some argue that ""whales"" – traders with large holdings – are effectively in control of the market.  Allegations  that the digital currency was the subject of an ""instamine"" scam – in which large amounts of coins were generated early on in its existence – have also resurfaced in light of the price rise, though the team behind dash has denied that the situation was as portrayed.  Still, the rise could be a mix of trends in both areas – a combination of long-term enthusiasts and short-term traders who, eager to see gains and ride the momentum, are also throwing their hats in the ring.  At press time, the price of dash is up 12.5% on the day.  What is dash?  To begin, dash is described by some as a two-tier network, one that relies on both miners and masternodes.  The network is secured by proof-of-work mining (the consensus mechanism bitcoin uses), while its X11 algorithm is based on eleven different hashing functions.  The masternode is a kind of proof-of-service layer. These nodes act as both transaction mixers and boosters, as well as voting mechanisms for the digital currency’s governance system.  Block rewards are divided between these two layers.  Miners receive 45% of rewards, masternodes receive 45%, and the other 10% is allocated to the decentralized budgeting system that dash utilizes. That system enables users to vote to allocate resources for development, marketing and other purposes.  Scarcity factor  One factor that seems to be having a concrete impact on the price rise is the relative scarcity of coins available for trade on major exchanges relative to the total supply of dash.  Poloniex data  , for example, shows roughly 40,000 coins is available on the sell-side, with about 1,500 coins worth of buy orders.  This scarcity is further fueled by the use of masternodes.  A masternode requires a deposit of 1,000 DASH, the network's cryptocurrency, funds that then generate income by receiving a portion of each mining block reward. Available data suggests that around 4,000 masternodes are being run today, meaning that more than half of the total coins in existence – about 7.1m – are locked up.  Chris Burninske, blockchain products lead for ARK Investment, has been tweeting his analysis of the market ramp-up, positing that the mix of an illiquid market and trading momentum is behind the push.  Burninske had previously published a twitter analysis of the digital currency, asserting that, in his view, the only key metric that shows upward growth is that of trade volume. Others, including market analyst Willy Woo, have also taken a critical tack.  In a statement to CoinDesk, Dash director of finance Ryan Taylor said that dash is ""proving itself in a highly competitive field"", citing the project's approach to governance and functionality.  “I believe that we are witnessing the market recognition of Dash as a true challenger to Bitcoin’s dominance of the cryptocurrency market. In a way that Bitcoin cannot, Dash is focusing on the user experience and applying payments industry best-practices into our product,"" he said.  Correction time  The analyses above raise the question of whether this price ramp will last in the long-term.  Data from Poloniex shows a big drop amidst today's trading, with the price hovering between $42 and $43 at press time.  Many speculators on social media, including the official dash subreddit, seem to back the notion that the price is in the midst of a significant bubble.  That said, it's anyone's best guess as to whether the price will rise, fall or maintain a kind of status-quo from here.  Meanwhile, bitcoin's price has seen significant momentum in recent days as well, hitting new all-time highs and even surpassing the per-ounce spot price of gold.

At the second reading of the bill in the state's House of Representatives, the motion suffered a strong rejection, with 84 lawmakers voting against the bill, four approving and six abstaining.  The decision follows speculation by the legislature's Business and Labor Committee, which was reported earlier this month to be critical of the bill, according to local news sources.  First introduced in the state senate in January, the bill eventually passed in a unanimous 46-0 vote, eventually moving on to the House of Representatives on 13th January. The bill sought to study ""the feasibility and desirability of regulating virtual currency, such as bitcoin"", according to the original text.  At the moment, the future of the bill now remains unclear, though it would need to be resubmitted to the Senate for new consideration.  Digital currency companies operating in the state include exchange services Coinbase and Gemini.

42427447,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKXNh,1488466810,The Price of Bitcoin is Now Worth More Than One Ounce of Gold,"Bitcoin's price has reached parity with the per-ounce spot price of gold, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  The per-ounce spot price for gold is $1,237.73, according to the XAU/USD spot exchange rate provided by Bloomberg Markets. Bitcoin's price, by comparison, is at $1,238.11, having opened the day at $1,230.02, BPI data shows.  The move follows a break to new all-time highs for the price of bitcoin, which began the year by crossing the $1,000 mark.  Markets have seen dizzying changes in recent weeks, breaking through a three-year-old high on 23rd February. Prices have largely continued to climb since.  Driving the price is overall bullish sentiment in the market, as traders have seemingly taken a positive tack toward the prospects of the US SEC approving the first-ever bitcoin ETF.  The SEC has a deadline of 11th March to make its decision.  Overall, it's been more than three years since the last time gold and bitcoin hit parity, though it's worth noting that this was on Mt Gox, which was the only exchange that had a price to reach parity.

42427436,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKX1h,1488464572,Reuters: Self-Proclaimed 'Satoshi' Craig Wright Still Seeking Bitcoin Patents,"Craig Wright, the Australian academic and businessman who previously claimed to be pseuduonymous bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, is back in the news.  Reuters has today published a new investigative piece exploring the links between Wright and Calvin Ayre, a Canadian entrepreneur with ties to the online gambling industry. The news agency also details alleged plans by the pair to seek as many as 400 patents related to bitcoin and blockchain technology in what it calls a ""land grab for intellectual property"".  In late 2015  , reporters identified Wright as at least one of the people behind the Nakamoto moniker – a move followed months later by a broad media roll-out backed by interviews with the BBC, The Economist and GQ. Yet observers quickly cast doubt on Wright’s assertions, sparking him to promise the release of more proof. Just days later, Wright said that he would provide no such proof.  The latest report appears to confirm past rumors that major news outlets are once again pursuing leads in the story.  Wright, the report goes on to detail, is working out of the offices of a firm called The Workshop Technologies, based in the UK. He was reportedly seen there as early as September of last year, where, according to Reuters, he has been providing work leading to the development of bitcoin patent applications.  Among the other details to emerge in the report, Wright allegedly planned to pitch the government of Antigua on making bitcoin its official currency. A document obtained by the news outlet suggests Wright planned to argue that bitcoin is “a new backbone and commercial foundation for the internet”.  However, according to Reuters, no confirmable information exists that would suggest such a presentation took place.  Notably, Antigua is where Ayre set up a multi-million dollar call center, with the entrepreneur citing bitcoin gambling as a major trend moving forward. As the news outlet notes, bitcoin’s early code included support for a built-in poker lobby, using the digital currency as a medium of exchange.

42427437,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKX3h,1488460633,Canada's Scotiabank Completes Blockchain Trial for Trade Reports,"Blockchain services firm AlphaPoint has completed a proof-of-technology trial of its blockchain platform for Canada's Scotiabank.  The AlphaPoint Distributed Ledger Platform (ADLP), which was deployed over a multi-month project, allows for the digitizing of assets, creation of trade venues, and the managing of pre- and post-trade workflows. During the trial, the ADLP was deployed on both Microsoft Azure and AlphaPoint’s own hardware, the blockchain firm said.  The ADLP was first announced in late 2015 and the company has been “more or less in stealth mode since then”, with the Scotiabank deal being its first major public announcement. According to the company, it currently has 14 customers at various stages of testing and using the platform.  AlphaPoint declined to go into too much detail about the specific tasks for which Scotiabank has been using the platform. “We have to be a little bit sensitive in terms of specific use cases in the trial specific to Scotiabank,” Igor Telyatnikov, the startup's president and COO, told CoinDesk. However the company's statement indicated that trade reports had been sent as part of the trial.  Scotiabank was unable to comment for this article.  However, the ADLP can be used for ""real world problems”, said Scott Scalf, EVP of technology at the company.  “It’s stuff I wish I had over the past couple decades as I was building and rebuilding various types of systems using legacy technology that didn’t have the holistic, complementary features and characteristics that we’re able to generate with a blockchain-based decentralized computing platform,” he explained.  Managing volume  Scalf said the platform was designed to handle large amounts of data and thousands of events per second.  “Just from a volume standpoint, the reality is, for these kinds of institutions to fully adopt this kind of technology, it’s got to support petabytes of data,” he said.  Scalf went on to explain that the platform has been built to maintain certain levels of privacy and anonymity, while also making records available to regulators:  “We’ve built from the ground up the ability to create private encrypted records not only about transactions, but even, within transactions, field-level encryption,"" he said, adding:  ""This increases the privacy for a wide variety of utilizations, but we’ve done it in such a way that those records can be made available to appropriately authorized regulators.”  Legacy hang-ups  In its announcement, AlphaPoint claimed the ADLP will integrate with legacy systems, but that still presents its own challenges. While the tests have been positive for the company, the team points out that the implementation of a platform like theirs takes time.  “The reality is, and I’ve been in these organizations for decades, there is not going to be a massive switchover [in the short term],” said Joe Ventura, CEO and CTO of AlphaPoint, adding that “incremental adoption” is gradually leading organizations to broader, widespread adoption.  “What we believe, talking with our clients and partners, is there’s real-world value to be had leveraging this kind of platform and technology for smaller problems initially that could grow into solving big issues,"" he said. ""But to do so you have to be able to participate in the existing ecosystem of mechanisms that they use for a variety of data processing and post-trade processing.”  Telyatnikov added that AlphaPoint will be making more announcements regarding its platform and its clients in the coming weeks.

42427439,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKX7h,1488458731,The Lack of Blockchain Talent is Becoming An Industry Concern,"The alleged lack of available talent for blockchain industry jobs was high on the agenda at the DTCC's Fintech Symposium, held at the Grand Hyatt in New York City yesterday.  There, executives from a wide range of companies took turns addressing an audience of several hundred financial industry executives to express their concern about what they believe is a problem preventing wider growth and use of the technology.  The issue came to a head following remarks by DTCC CEO Mike Bodson, who listed the lack of qualified blockchain professionals as among his company's top industry concerns.  After the opening remarks, blockchain leaders speaking on a panel centered on the ""hard lessons"" they’ve learned over the past year echoed Bodson's concern in near unison.  Brian Behlendorf, executive director of the Linux Foundation-led Hyperledger project, said:  ""The tech recruiting is very thin. So, recruiting is hard.""  In the year since Hyperledger launched, it has grown to over 100 members, but the firm is currently still hiring for four positions, including two non-developer 'community architect' openings, Behlendorf said.  But even what is considered a blockchain job is changing.  According to Credit Suisse's head of blockchain development, Emmanuel Aidoo, members of what might be considered 'traditional finance' need to stop being ""worried about what happened to their slice of the cake"".  ""This is not going to stop,"" he added.  Instead, he encouraged members of the audience without blockchain skills to focus on what they do know, and how it may relate to a blockchain-based financial infrastructure.  ""Folks that really know how the process works today are going to be very important,"" he said.  The blockchain job market  Though concrete blockchain employment numbers are hard to come by, there is some anecdotal evidence that can begin to paint a picture.  In a report earlier this week that focused exclusively on companies that were actually building a blockchain, only four had more than 100 employees, with the total people employed by the 'Top 10' blockchain companies equalling less than 600 people.  Job site Indeed.com currently lists 300 job opportunities that mention 'blockchain' somewhere in the description. Of those, 70 are listed for tech giant IBM, 19 for ethereum startup ConsenSys and 14 for global auditing firm Deloitte.  Still, the two most active blockchain developer ecosystems remain the two with cryptocurrency: bitcoin and ethereum.  As such, it wasn't a surprise when, at the launch of enterprise version of the ethereum network this week, talk about its ample development community took center stage.  Knowing where to look  And not everyone agrees that finding blockchain talent is as difficult as some say.  One theory was put forth by Todd McDonald, co-founder of blockchain consortium startup R3CEV. The company, based in New York, is one of four listed in the recent report with more than 100 employees.  According to McDonald, the demand for blockchain jobs doesn’t add up to a dearth of jobs, but a glut, if you know where to look.  ""There's a need for talent,"" he said. ""But there’s so much out there.""  McDonald encouraged the audience of mostly finance professionals to look within their own ranks for opportunities to retrain existing staff.  ""Dozens of folks that you don’t even know about ... are hacking away on the weekends,"" he said.  Investing in blockchain jobs  Regardless, the demand for new talent in blockchain was positioned by Bodson as being part of a bigger, industry demand.  Speaking during a keynote address that kicked off the symposium, Bodson described it as ""imperative"" to nurture blockchain jobs, along with those for machine intelligence, cloud computing and financial technology positions  Citing a recent poll, Bodson said 70% of his clients are having trouble filling fintech positions, including for blockchain.  To help meet the growing demand Bodson said the DTCC is “prepared to do all we can to support” the education of scientists, engineers and mathematicians.  He concluded:  ""We need to place a greater emphasis on developing future talent.""

42427434,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKWvh,1488450623,Ethereum Spam Attacks Are Back – This Time on the Test Network,"Ethereum is under attack again.  Following denial of service attacks on the ethereum network last year, which were stopped with a pair of forks in which all miners upgraded to a network with new rules, an attacker has picked an easier target to spam: Ropsten, the ethereum testing network.  Similar to the main network, save a few details, the testnet is a network where developers can test their decentralized apps, or “dapps,” to simulate what would happen on the main network and determine if their dapps are working properly.  Since January  , an anonymous miner has been clogging the network with spam to such a degree that it’s hard for developers to send transactions and smart contracts on the main testing arena.  If they try, it often takes much longer than normal.  The address of the attacker is the same as the one associated with an earlier fork of the test network, according to software developer Ricardo Guilherme Schmidt, who's been following actions associated with the address.  At least a few developers and executives at the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance launch event in Brooklyn argued that one reason they chose to work with ethereum was because it’s a more heavily tested platform. Ironically, one of ethereum’s key testing tools has been effectively out of service for more than a month.  As the miner’s identity is unknown, users have merely speculated as to why he or she (or they) are clogging the network with spam. They may be trying to prove a security-related point or may be simply trolling.  Easy solution  Many ethereum apps are only available for use on the testnet right now. As a result, developers behind apps like uPort and Status have mentioned testing app delays. Etheroll temporarily closed down the testnet option.  Gnosis CTO Stefan George told CoinDesk:  ”For us developers this is a big issue, as integrations between different dapps can only easily be tested in a shared test network. We are currently building a Twitterbot for Gnosis using uPort, but cannot test it properly because of this attack.”  George added that this means that developers are restricted to local testnets or the test-rpc client to test applications. With these limited testing environments, it’s harder to test how dapps interact with each other. For that, developers need a global test network, like Ropsten.  However, George argues that there is an easy solution to this: whitelisting which miners can participate on the test network.  There would be no disadvantages to this approach, according to George. The whitelisted mining group could be composed of big ethereum organizations, say, Ethereum Foundation and ConsenSys, maintaining the network.  Anatomy of the attacks  So, what is the attacker doing, exactly?  Like the main network, the ethereum test network is maintained by miners. The difference is that, the miners maintaining it don’t have an incentive to use more powerful hardware, because the tokens are worthless – they're just used for testing transactions.  This particular miner is using a GPU (a computing processor that is much more powerful than those used by other miners on the network) to mine, which is odd, because the miner doesn’t have an incentive to do so.  “There was hardly anyone mining on Ropsten, as it is just for testing. The attacker could easily get the mining majority,” George said.  On the testnet, it’s easy to either mine the tokens yourself, using the Ethereum Wallet, for example. Or, testers can obtain free tokens from so-called 'faucets'.  The attacker is doing several things: on the one hand, they’re mining most of the blocks and obtaining the rewards, so other miners can’t, and they have used one or more contracts to drain at least one faucet of its free ether. Therefore, it’s making it more difficult for app developers to obtain test ether with which they can conduct test transactions.  Secondly, because it's mining with relatively high computing power, the miner has been able to raise the maximum amount of computational processing power allowed in each block (the 'gas limit') to 2GB, and is filling them with spammy transactions.  ""He also deployed a contract [like] block.gaslimit or msg.gas to loop a spam in the network with max gas possible,"" Schmidt said.  Put another way, the miner is hogging the transaction bandwidth so that other users struggle to use it.  Cost factor  The ongoing spamming is reminiscent of last year’s attacks, which slowed down transactions and smart contracts on the ethereum network for months.  The difference, of course, is this attack doesn’t affect the main ethereum network.  Decentralized applications deployed on the main network are working fine. Ethlance director of operations Joseph Urgo noted that his platform is unaffected by the attack, for example.  If the attacker were to carry out the same attack on the main network, he or she wouldn’t have much success.  The attacker spent an estimated $120 to spam the network up until last Sunday. Based on rough calculations by ethereum inventor Vitalik Buterin, it would take $4.5m to have the same effect on the main network.  Buterin concluded:  “So all in all, not much cheaper than a 51% attack.”  Helicopter image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | ETH | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2017/03/02/ethereum-spam-attacks-are-back-this-time-on-the-test-network,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/65f0194791618bc6dd5763492753e995c1cc2eca-1492x682.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42427440,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKX5h,1488418175,47 Banks Complete DLT Cloud Pilot With Ripple Tech,"A consortium of 47 banks has completed a distributed ledger technology (DLT) pilot that is now set to move to production in 2017.  Announced today by SBI Ripple Asia, Ripple's joint venture arm with Tokyo-based financial services firm SBI Holdings, the firms lauded the test as an example of how Ripple’s technology could be leveraged by clients, even when not deployed on premise at each individual company.  Daiwa Next Bank, Mizuho Bank, Nomura Trust, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust and ORIX Bank were some of the banks involved in the trial. (A full list is available with the official press release.)  In interview, Patrick Griffin, executive vice president of business development at Ripple, framed this as a stark contrast to standard policies in place at banks in Europe and North America.  Griffin told CoinDesk:  ""RC Cloud is a product that puts our enterprise solution in the cloud, allowing for banks in the region to use APIs to connect to the software and access to the solution without an install.""  Production ahead  Griffin explained that the pilot showcases how banks could use Ripple's Connect product and its Interledger protocol to send transactions between each other, as well as any other bank running the software, both domestically and internationally.  As a result of the successful test, Griffin said some banks involved are now committed to moving to production deployment of the RC Cloud in 2017.  ""Several banks are planning to go into production around Autumn,"" Emi Yoshikawa, director of joint venture partnerships at Ripple, added. ""They will now begin discussing the rules and standards between banks.""  Notably, while Ripple has emphasized the effectiveness of its payment solution in international context, Yoshikawa, whose job is to liaison with Ripple’s partners in the Japanese market, cited the difficulties with domestic transactions as a motivating factor among participants.  ""Domestic payments are actually very expensive, it's 5x to 10x more expensive than in the US,"" she said, citing issues with Japan’s domestic ZenGin Net system, and the heavy use of cash by Japanese consumers.  Yoshikawa suggested just 19% of domestic transactions are cashless, a number in line with research from the Japan Consumer Credit Association, though research from MasterCard has put this number as high as 62%.  According to figures from SBI, SBI Ripple Asia is 60% owned by the bank and 40% owned by Ripple. SBI owns 11.2% of Ripple shares.  SBI has reported it saves 12.6 bps on international remittances when using Ripple's technology and its native asset XRP, earning a 60% cost reduction.  Connecting the blocks  Griffin went on to highlight how Ripple believes the project fits into its broader progress as a company, and its work with its wider network of banking partners.  Since launching in 2012, Ripple has faced competition from an increasing diversity of consortia, including the Linux Foundation-led Hyperledger project and banking consortium R3CEV.  However, Griffin contends that Ripple’s approach, emphasizing ""production"" and a focus on specific use cases, is providing more value.  Ultimately, he argues that RC Cloud product, if deployed regionally, could plug into the work ongoing at its Global Payments Steering Group (GPSG), which Griffin framed as a direct competitor to the Swift network.  Asked about Swift's plans to modernize its system, Griffin offered a critical take.  ""Ripple is a significant upgrade. Swift does not represent an innovation in the payment structure,"" he said, adding:  ""We roll out product and Swift does not.""
