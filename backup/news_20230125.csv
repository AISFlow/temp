42435134,te14p4VjvrIefREtKdorby,1674685884,Binance USD Stablecoin Sees $2B Reduction in a Month Amid Token Mismanagement,"Crypto exchange giant Binance’s BUSD stablecoin has extended its recent declines, amid mismanagement issues involving the exchange’s pegged tokens that surfaced earlier this month, and other debacles.  BUSD’s circulating supply fell to $15.4 billion on Wednesday, paring down $1 billion over the past week and $2 billion in a month, according to cryptocurrency price tracker CoinGecko. The latest drop extended BUSD’s decline from $22 billion in early December when anxious users scrambled to withdraw funds from Binance after it botched a report about its digital asset reserves.  Read more: Binance Withdrawals Surge as Concerns About Its Reserve Report Spook Traders  BUSD is a dollar-pegged stablecoin issued by the New York-based fintech firm Paxos Trust under the Binance brand, backed by cash and U.S. Treasury bill reserves. Traders use stablecoins as an intermediary to convert traditional fiat money to digital assets and facilitate trading cryptocurrencies.  The latest decline comes amid recent reports about errors involving the exchange's wrapped token derivatives known as Binance-peg tokens.  Earlier this month, blockchain research firm ChainArgos found that Binance-peg BUSD was not always fully backed by reserves during 2020 and 2021. Binance acknowledged the breach and said it has fixed them. This week, Bloomberg reported the exchange mixed customer funds with the collateral of Binance-peg tokens.  In a blow for retail traders, Binance’s banking partner Signature Bank will halt transfers smaller than $100,000 using the SWIFT interbank messaging system, starting Feb. 1.  The recent issues resulted in BUSD falling further behind stablecoin rivals in what has become a fierce competition. BUSD lost 11.3% of its market capitalization in a month, while USDT gained 1.3% and USDC dropped just 1.9%, according to data by DefiLlama, which tracks digital assets' performances. Still, BUSD is the only one of the top three stablecoins that grew its market value through last year.  The overall market capitalization of stablecoins fell for a 10th consecutive month in January, to $137 billion, according to a report by research group CryptoCompare. Stablecoin dominance within the broad cryptocurrency market dropped to 12.4% from its all-time high of 16.5% in December, suggesting traders have been rotating from stablecoins into riskier assets, CryptoCompare said.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/25/binance-usd-stablecoin-sees-2b-reduction-in-a-month-amid-token-mismanagement,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/38884b6b31f2a29882758e13b0a47cd8c3a2cbe7-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Related Reading: MakerDAO Passes Proposal To Deploy $100 Million USDC In Yearn Finance Vault According to Goldman Sachs, Bitcoin has outperformed its cryptocurrency pairs and those major financial institutions of the traditional market with a risk-adjusted return (Sharpe ratio) of 3.1. The Sharpe Ratio is used to measure market volatility-adjusted performance; the higher the ratio, the better the investment, currency, or stock in terms of risk-adjusted returns. Bitcoin Takes The Lead In Broad Market Recovery On smaller timeframes, Bitcoin continues its quest to regain lost territory. Slowly but steadily, Bitcoin is attempting to break above the resistance level of $23,800. Bitcoin appears to have a healthy pullback below the resistance line in search of bullish momentum. Despite the recent crisis of not only the cryptocurrency market with the collapse of FTX and the world economy in free fall, bringing consequences for investors and institutions, the market has also noted the comeback of market makers on cryptocurrency exchanges. In contrast with Goldman Sachs’ report, according to an annual report by CoinGecko, Bitcoin is the worst-performing asset among the major currencies, with a significant decline of 64%. CoinGecko also noted that since January 2022, the trading volume in the spot market has decreased by 67%. The new year for Bitcoin and the market started positively, with $200 billion bulking the volume and volatility sheets, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin’s year-to-date solid rally has shifted market sentiment. Analysts seem bullish in the short term, expecting the cryptocurrency to increase to as much as $30,000. However, in the long term, economist Lyn Alden said that Bitcoin could be in “considerable danger” in the second quarter of 2023 as liquidity risks increase. As the price of Bitcoin consolidates below the resistance zone, the cryptocurrency is looking for a trendline break to position itself above the $24,500 level, representing its next obstacle. The rising 20-day moving average at $20,700 and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) in the overbought zone near 80 suggest that BTC’s bullish trend line can continue and conquer new regions. Conversely, bears are ready to stall the Bitcoin price action to the upside and turn the momentum and direction of the market, but bulls seem unwilling to surrender. Speculation is on the rise with no certainties in the market and the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings.

This article originally appeared in Crypto Markets Today, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  The token, APT, hit new record highs and is up 427% since Jan. 1, according to CoinDesk data.  APT was more recently changing hands at $18.30, a more than 46% gain over the past 24 hours.  The token’s rally has outsized recent moves from the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, bitcoin and ether. Bitcoin is up 30% in 2023 while ether has gained 34%.  The funding rates for the token are still negative, however, suggesting traders are expecting the rally to be short-lived.  “If traders are willing to open short positions with highly negative funding rates, they must have belief the token will decline,” Christopher Newhouse, a crypto derivatives trader at crypto market maker GSR, said. “Despite the surge, this suggests shorts think the rally may have gone too far.”  Token Roundup  Bitcoin (BTC): The largest cryptocurrency by market value rebounded from a late Tuesday swoon to recently trade at around $22,950, roughly flat over the past 24 hours. BTC sank below $22,500 the previous day along with most other major cryptos as many investors likely took profits after a four-day upsurge. Bitcoin has risen more than 35% in value this year.  Equities traded sideways with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, S&P 500, which has a hefty technology component, and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) all down a few smidgens of a percentage point. Investors chewed over the latest cascade of fourth-quarter earnings, including those of Boeing and Microsoft.  Ether (ETH): ETH had yet to recover as much ground as bitcoin from the Tuesday crypto fall. The second-largest crypto in market value was recently changing hands at about $1,580, off roughly 2.1%.  Popular meme coins dogecoin (DOGE) and shiba inu (SHIB) tumbled about 2.6% and 3.3%, respectively.  Axie infinity (AXS): Play-to-earn giant Axie Infinity's AXS cryptocurrency, which reached a four-month high of $13.94 earlier Monday and was up 13% at one point Tuesday, continued its surge.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Crypto Market Analysis: Derivatives Markets Signal Continuation of Bullish Sentiment  By Glenn Williams Jr.  Derivatives markets are signaling positive sentiment for bitcoin..  Bitcoin’s current term structure is in “contango,” a condition that exists when the price of bitcoin futures exceeds the price of bitcoin in spot markets.  Contango is represented by an upward-sloping futures curve. The opposite condition is “backwardation,” where futures prices are lower than spot prices, and represented by a downward-sloping price curve.  In traditional markets, where supply, demand and physical storage are significant factors, contango is often a bearish sign because the difference between the futures and spot price is based largely on the cost of transporting and storing that asset.

42393907,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brc3Fh,1674683935,"What You Need to Know About Crypto Regulation in Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan","Top global financial centers Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore have some of the most mature financial regulations worldwide. It’s no surprise, therefore, that discussions on how to regulate crypto began years ago, though they have taken very different directions.  Japan went hard on consumer protection but more recently has relaxed requirements for token listings and pushed a more welcoming message for firms. While China banned crypto trading and clamped down on mining, Hong Kong exerted its autonomy to chart its own way, announcing that it was open to crypto firms in a bid to preserve its status as an international finance center. Crypto firms may find meeting the regulatory bar to be difficult in the beginning, but the signs are that regulations will keep easing. Meanwhile, in Singapore, existing market players know that regulations will tighten further. Last year’s implosion of high-profile firms registered in the city-state, such as Three Arrows Capital and Terraform Labs, kicked off a regulatory process that looks likely to result in more restrictive regulations.  Read more: As part of CoinDesk’s Policy Week, reporters covered the regulatory outlook in the biggest financial centers of Asia, including India, South Korea and Japan.  Despite their differences, “The more developed markets in Asia are fairly advanced in providing clarity on what falls within the virtual asset service provider (VASP) framework,” Vivien Khoo, co-founder of the Asia Crypto Alliance said, noting that Hong Kong and Singapore have a “fairly similar” VASP framework.  Collaboration among countries across the region will tighten. “It will be much harder to engage in regulatory arbitrage now in Asia,” Khoo said.  Japan  Japan was among the earliest countries worldwide to regulate cryptocurrency exchanges, but that wasn’t because it wanted to be ahead of the curve. The agency simply had drafted Japan's body of law on virtual currencies to fulfill an agreement made in 2014 with fellow members of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), according to a person close to Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA).  But in early 2017, when China’s government shut down some exchanges in what was crypto’s trading epicenter, Japan became one of the most dynamic places in the world for crypto. The nation had been burned once already by the hack and subsequent failure of crypto exchange Mt Gox in 2014. The $530 million hack of local exchange CoinCheck in 2018 proved a turning point for its crypto policy.  In came some of the strictest consumer protection legislation worldwide, placing high demands on exchanges (some of them complain that compliance cuts into their profitability), including mandating them to segregate exchange and customer assets, and hold most customer assets in cold wallets.  The upside is that customers of FTX’s Japan subsidiary will get their funds, while those of other FTX entities suffered tremendous losses. Now, legislators in Japan are looking to show companies that it’s a good time to set up shop in the country.  Japan’s politicians put their heft behind speeding up their regulatory process last year. In December, the country approved an important tax change, which will be put into law this year. Projects will be able to issue tokens without paying onerous corporate taxes, which had essentially forced them abroad. “It’s definitely a clear signal from the Japanese government that we are pro-crypto,” Akihisa Shiozaki, Liberal Democratic Party politician and secretary general of the party’s Web3 project team, told CoinDesk.  For a deeper dive into Japan's emerging crypto policy, read Japan Embraces Web3 As Global Regulators Grow Wary of Crypto  This year, the country’s lawmakers will continue discussions on legalizing decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and regulation may be issued sometime during this year’s legislative session, which ends in June. Shiozaki said that the aim is to add clarity in taxation and formal legal structure in giving limited liability to members involved in crypto projects. He said that key themes under discussion relate to disclosure obligations, security offering, and internal governance rules.  “What will not happen is a strengthening or tightening of controls against crypto,” Shiozaki said.  Hong Kong  Hong Kong’s is a different story. Limited regulation on crypto meant the city was once home to some of the biggest names in the business, including Bitmex and, at one time, now-defunct exchange FTX.  In recent years, Hong Kong lost that lead. Firms were scared off when its Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) started examining token listings. When China’s latest ban on crypto was announced, some companies wondered if the city’s autonomy was under threat. The Zero-Covid policy and long hotel quarantines further dampened spirits. Asia’s premier crypto festival, Token 2049, left Hong Kong for its rival financial hub Singapore.  A person close to the SFC told CoinDesk that if the city were really to ban crypto, regulators would have had a heads-up early on from the powers-that-be across the border and would not have spent many months drawing up regulation. Still, many firms weren’t getting that message.  Even so, all through last year retail investors were still speculating on non-fungible tokens (NFT) and using unlicensed exchanges, the city’s richest were talking metaverse, and bitcoin machines and over-the-counter crypto shops were everywhere in the city. The philosophy seemed to be to make money until regulation came in.  Companies that wanted to be compliant complained that the regulator sat on applications for its opt-in licensing process, sending them a question once every few months. Only one firm had a license (another had in-principle approval) by the time Hong Kong FinTech Week rolled around.  The city’s regulators saw an outflow of talent and firms, which could affect its status as an international finance center. They made a concerted push to change the narrative. They announced the city was open to crypto firms and that they would dial back on plans to restrict retail from using licensed exchanges. They repeatedly underscored the city’s autonomy, in financial regulation, from China.  The incoming VASP regime, as it stood at the beginning of last year, would have meant only exchanges with licenses could operate in the city and that they could not serve retail. It was set to come into effect in March 2023 (and has since been pushed back to June 2023 with applicants also enjoying a grace period).  Formal consultations on requirements for virtual asset service providers to offer services to retail will start soon, a government source told CoinDesk.  On Jan 11, Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) Chief Executive Officer Julia Leung indicated that the regulator is preparing a list of tokens in which retail investors will be able to invest. Jason Chan, senior associate at law firm Dechert, told CoinDesk that it is likely the initial list of tokens that exchanges will be able to offer to retail will be very limited because the SFC will first stick to what they’re comfortable with.  The SFC is actively working on a derivatives framework but discussions with the industry have been quite preliminary and unlikely to result in any regulation this year. “If players want to stay in the Hong Kong market they are likely going to strip out some of their functions,” Chan said.  What is expected this year, however, is stablecoin regulation, with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority issuing a discussion paper laying out its position that only license-holding companies will be able to issue stablecoins and offer cross-border payments. In addition, this year will also see further announcements from the SFC on the issuance of security token offerings and virtual asset structured products.  It’s worth noting that at FinTech Week, not everything was crypto. The government announced it would relax visa requirements to attract more talent. “The bigger picture is really Hong Kong's position as an international financial center at the macro level,” Khoo said.  Singapore  Singapore is trying to square two goals. It’s famously conservative and protective of consumers but it’s also eager to establish itself as a modern fintech hub.  Faced with corporate taxes on token issuance in Japan, and Hong Kong appearing less than friendly, Singapore’s established regulatory framework for crypto made it seem like a more predictable homebase for many firms.  After FTX’s collapse, a Singaporean Web3 startup founder told CoinDesk that crypto exchanges aren’t casinos to many Singaporeans, but digital banks for on-ramping their salaries and investing in yield products.  “Our banking system is too conservative to offer similar product suites to simple folk,” the founder said. “Or they do, but charge ridiculous fees for needlessly complex financial products in the form of unit trusts and other garbage.” No surprise, then, that Singapore contributed the second-largest chunk to FTX.com’s monthly unique visitors.  Last year saw the implosion of some of crypto’s biggest names in Singapore: Terraform Labs and crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, who were registered there. Toward year’s end, Singaporean police began investigating crypto lender Hodlnaut, one of the casualties of contagion. These blowups gave more impetus to an already present tendency to prioritize risk management and close consumer protection gaps.  The regulator’s wheels are already in motion. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) issued key consultations, which closed just before Christmas, on stablecoins and reducing consumer harm to retail.  Consultation conclusions will likely be issued within the first half of this year. Legislative changes will come towards the end of the year or early next year, according to industry insiders. What remains to be seen is whether MAS will incorporate opinions from industry players who have raised concerns.  Among the proposed measures are restricting firms from lending out retail customers’ tokens. The aim of this measure is clear – the collapse of platforms meant consumers had little recourse to recover their assets, as lending and staking is currently unregulated.  While MAS is considering requirements for risk disclosures for lending and staking, the regulator seems to be leaning towards outright prohibition, Nizam Ismail, CEO of Ethikom Consultancy and chairman of the regulatory and compliance sub-committee for the Blockchain Association of Singapore, told CoinDesk. “By putting in place blanket bans, Singapore-based platforms would be disadvantaged in not being able to offer these features,” Ismail said.  The proposal also has implications for decentralized finance. DeFi protocols such as Automated Market Makers (AMM) offer a number of benefits, such as allowing digital payment tokens to be traded in a permissionless and automatic way by using liquidity pools rather than a traditional market of buyers and sellers, Rahul Advani, policy director, APAC, at Ripple, said. The proposed restriction “reduces what you can do with DeFi substantially.”  Banks and brokers can do securities lending and that the outstanding question is why digital assets should be treated differently, he added.  Another area of concern is that MAS may expect service providers to have the same technological risk requirements as banks. “That’s going to be onerous for fintechs,” Advani said. He noted that crypto companies often rely on other service providers which may not have the level of service-level agreements that MAS expects.  On stablecoins, the industry is waiting to see whether stablecoin issuers that are not banks are subject to the same capital requirements. There is also an open question on how MAS will treat issuers of stablecoins used in the local market but not issued in the local market.  Of course, regulations issued by MAS will only apply to licensed firms, which are waiting to see if new regulations still enable them to remain competitive. “There is a potential risk that unlicensed and unregulated service providers become more attractive venues for the general Singapore public to trade digital assets,” a representative from CoinHako, the country’s leading licensed exchange, told CoinDesk.  This year, Asia may be second only to the European Union, in pushing for clarity in crypto policies.

42435152,te14p4VjvrIefREtKdot74,1674682998,Robinhood’s Twitter Account Promotes Scam Token on Binance’s BNB Chain in Unauthorized Posts,"Add Robinhood Markets (HOOD) to the list of parties affected by crypto frauds – the online brokerage’s social media profiles on Wednesday promoted the launch of RBH, a new scam token on the BNB Chain.  The crypto ecosystem was quick to presume that Robinhood’s social accounts, which have 1.6 million followers across Instagram, Twitter and Facebook, had been hacked, and that the launch of the RBH token on the Binance Smart Chain was a fraudulent crypto project.  Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said the situation “looks like Robinhood account got hacked” and stressed the importance of critical thinking when assessing the promotion of a coin on the BNB Chain.  Even though the Robinhood tweet has since been taken down, 61 addresses hold RBH, according to BscScan, and $16,335 worth of wrapped BNB had been transferred in exchange for the ""new"" token in a PancakeSwap liquidity pool, as of press time.  “Based on our ongoing investigation, we believe the source of the incident was via a third-party vendor,” said Robinhood in a statement after becoming aware of the unauthorized posts from its social media profiles.  While the amount of money lost remains relatively low compared to the massive hacks that occurred in 2022 – the $325 million from the Wormhole bridge attack and $200 million from the Nomad bridge exploit being two of them – these efforts are likely to continue.  This is not the first time Binance has had to warn about hacks targeting its users. Roughly 12% of all BEP-20 tokens, the standard token on BNB chain, are connected to scams, according to crypto risk monitoring firm Solidus Labs.  Moreover, when conducting a trade between wrapped BNB (wBNB) and RBH on PancakeSwap, a crypto exchange built on the BNB Chain, users are warned before executing the trade that the RBH token comes from an “unknown source” and is “high risk.”  How it happened:  Today’s scam started when a Binance hot wallet that holds $19.6 million in various tokens sent the scammer some BNB, the native token for Binance, worth roughly $1,000 (Tx1 and Tx2).  Afterwards, the scammer conducted several test transactions to create BEP-20 tokens (Tx3, Tx4) and to add liquidity for PancakeSwap pools (Tx5, Tx6) before triggering a transaction that minted 100 million RBH tokens into its address.  The scammer then activated a transaction to add the 100 million RBH tokens and 3.1 wrapped BNB tokens as liquidity into the PancakeSwap liquidity pool.  The grift culminated when Robinhood posted the launch of the scam token on its social media accounts, which increased the volume sales in the liquidity pool composed of the two assets: wBNB and RBH.  Roughly $3.7 billion were lost to various attacks, hacks and scams in 2022, per Blockchain Security Firm CertiK. It remains to be seen how 2023 will fare. DYOR always.

Kang and two other executives – including his younger sister, Kang Ji-Yeon, the CEO of two publicly traded Bithumb affiliates, Inbiogen and Bucket Studio – were charged by the Seoul Southern District Prosecutor’s Office with embezzlement, breach of trust and fraudulent illegal transactions, according to local reports.  Earlier this month, it was reported that South Korea’s National Tax Service had opened an investigation into possible tax evasion at Bithumb and its affiliates.

42393866,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brb0j3,1674680735,Crypto Markets Analysis: Derivatives Markets Signal Continuation of Bullish Sentiment,"Derivatives markets are signaling positive sentiment for bitcoin.  Bitcoin’s current term structure is in “contango,” a condition that exists when the price of bitcoin futures exceeds the price of bitcoin in spot markets. Graphically, contango is represented by an upward-sloping futures curve. The opposite condition is “backwardation,” where futures prices are lower than spot prices, and represented by a downward-sloping price curve.  In traditional markets, where supply, demand and physical storage are significant factors, contango is often a bearish sign because the difference between the futures and spot price is based largely on the cost of transporting and storing that asset. For physical commodities, when a price curve is in contango the futures price is expected to move downward to meet the spot price.  Backwardation in physical markets represents the opposite. Supply shortages of the asset will drive its price higher in spot markets than in futures markets, as demand in the short term outstrips supply. This is often a bullish sign.  These trends are often counterintuitive, given the upward and downward slope of the curves themselves.  For bitcoin, where issues related to physical storage do not apply, a futures curve in contango simply represents increased buying in futures markets, and can indicate bullish sentiment.  Traders will likely monitor the extent to which the spread between BTC spot and BTC futures prices expands, however. As contango grows, the opportunity to quickly benefit from the spread will do the same, as traders may go long in spot markets while selling short in futures.  BTC’s current funding rate is also signaling bullish. The BTC perpetual funding rate represents the rate that exchanges set for futures contracts. When funding rates are positive, traders who are long BTC contracts pay a fee to traders who are short.  The opposite condition, where shorts pay a fee to traders long BTC futures, occurs when funding rates are negative.  BTC’s funding rate has been positive for 11 consecutive days, and 17 out of the last 20, implying that the plurality of traders hold bullish views of bitcoin.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/25/crypto-markets-analysis-derivatives-markets-signal-continuation-of-bullish-sentiment,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b994a84a779747f15b1d7667ec9a74879a7dc8e0-1683x1262.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The collection’s floor price has more than doubled from its mint price – shifting gears from the initial launch on Monday, when the secondary market price struggled to meet the mint price, with most of the NFTs trading at a discount shortly after the project crossed the starting line.  Porsche’s initial plan was to sell 7,500 tokens at a floor price of 0.911 ether (ETH), or roughly $1,420. However, NFT Twitter quickly excoriated the collection’s launch, noting large supply and high price as factors in the flop as well as the brand’s lack of understanding of Web3 strategy.

42421386,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnzdl,1674679607,How Industry Can Prevent the Crypto Winter From Becoming an Ice Age,"Over the last several months, the American people and lawmakers in Congress have gotten a crash course on cryptocurrency. Unless something changes, they might think twice before enrolling in the next semester. The current environment represents an existential threat to digital assets, but also has considerable implications for the future of traditional market participants and the broader economy.  Before the FTX crypto exchange’s collapse, most Americans were vaguely aware of digital assets. A small number held cryptocurrencies, others had relatives or friends who dabbled in it,and many more saw commercials for it during last year’s Super Bowl or other sporting events. What came across then as innovative and perhaps a bit quirky now has the look of the financial equivalent of Operation Varsity Blues.  John Rizzo is senior vice president for Public Affairs at Clyde Group where he provides strategic counsel and communications. He most recently served as the senior spokesperson at the U.S. Department of the Treasury covering digital assets, fintech, climate finance, financial stability, domestic finance and economic policy. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's Policy Week.  As we enter a year of likely regulatory and legislative action, cryptocurrency is indeed in a moment of crisis. The so-called crypto winter could easily turn into an ice age unless market participants work to define the digital asset ecosystem outside of what the American people and lawmakers are seeing on their screens every day. It’s a tall task given the gravity of what’s taken place, but a necessary one given the implications for American economic competitiveness and traditional market participants as well.  When thinking of what’s at stake, we have to consider digital assets in their appropriate context. While digital assets represent a new financial innovation, they also reflect a broader trend of digitization in finance that has occurred over decades and is unlikely to change. Observers of financial innovation have seen this cycle before during other periods of disruption. Innovation occurs among a host of new market participants – many fail and some succeed but along the way, and perhaps most impactfully, traditional market participants seize certain elements of the innovation, use them for their own ends and normalize them in the everyday economy. We’ve seen this recently as companies deploy blockchain technologies and banks experiment with stablecoins to more quickly and efficiently move resources.

As many observers recognize, the cryptocurrency ecosystem is largely contained within itself – for now. Forward-thinking market participants understand the trend: The future of the economy is digitized, tokenized and potentially decentralized. The rules of the road that are put in place for crypto-asset innovations will impact traditional financial market participants as they seek to harness crypto-asset innovation for their own ends.  The policies we put in place now will impact the bottom lines of crypto companies and traditional financial institutions. But it’s also about the future of the American economy. To continue to lead the global economy, America must continue to set the policy pace in a financial system that will be increasingly digitized and tokenized.  The moment to seize the policy initiative will not last long. Already, several countries are ahead of the U.S in the creation of central bank digital currencies, including China, and Europe is further advanced than the U.S. in putting in place comprehensive regulatory frameworks for digital assets. We can either shape the future economy to best serve our citizens and businesses or other nations will bring further innovation, efficiencies, and jobs to their shores rather than our own.  With the future of the financial system and American competitiveness on its shoulders, the digital asset industry must move quickly to repair the damage from the recent months' scandals. That begins with meeting policymakers and the American people where they are, namely a place of deep skepticism about digital assets. Happy talk about a utopian crypto future isn’t going to cut it with Congress, regulators or the public. There will be no one taking the digital asset industry for its word on anything.  Unfortunately, the actions of a few bad actors may have squandered that opportunity. Those who believe in the power of digital assets must move quickly to define the current environment, show real-world use cases for digital assets and demonstrate how this era of financial innovation can positively impact everyday Americans.  FTX’s collapse was about the corruption, not crypto per se, and the digital assets industry must speak clearly with one voice about this. Sam Bankman-Fried committed old-school theft of assets, misuse of funds and straight-up dishonesty with customers. He didn’t need crypto to commit his alleged crimes; it was merely the venue for his misdeeds. Unfortunately, Bankman-Fried’s alleged malfeasance has become the image that lawmakers and the American public have about digital assets, when most in the community are driven by a hunger to reform the financial system and improve the lives of people who exist outside of it.  The cryptocurrency industry must also come together to hold its own accountable and embrace appropriate regulation. Refusing to tolerate fraudsters, scammers and money launderers will strengthen the case for lawmakers and the American public for the continued existence of its innovation.  Read more: Jesse Hamilton - After FTX: How Congress Is Gearing Up to Regulate Crypto  Moreover, an industry that recognizes that it must exist within a regulatory perimeter as part of the regular economy will be in a better position to argue for rules that are tailored to its unique innovations.  The industry’s North Star cannot be ""growth at any cost” and musing about numbers going up. A desire for sugar-high growth must be replaced by demonstration of real value. Many in the digital assets community have been fighting for these exact things for years, only to be washed over by the wave of FTX’s misdeeds.  The digital assets industry has a significant responsibility to right the ship following FTX’s collapse, but Washington, D.C., has a responsibility as well. For digital asset innovation to benefit the economy and regular Americans, it must be taken off the table in the partisan food fight. Those on the right who see cryptocurrency as a means to starve the government beast and those on the left eager to smear genuine financial innovation as a mere Ponzi scheme have forestalled desperately needed bipartisan compromise. Digital assets aren’t going away. They can’t be banned practically. Policymakers should recognize the undercurrents of digitization and tokenization in the economy instead of wishing digital assets would just go away.  The public’s crash course on cryptocurrency will continue as proceedings related to FTX play out. The industry is at deep risk of seeing this educational course turn into an empty section in next semester’s catalog, but it does not have to be that way. A practical commitment to basic rules of the road paired with an honest effort at bipartisan compromise in Washington can have a positive impact, leaving traditional market participants seeking to harness this innovation, and a country hungry to remain competitive and set the rules for the future economy.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,John Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/01/25/cryptocurrency-crisis-repair,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d0e4cb1440b450aaafc71960493197267b860588-3803x2535.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As CEO, Barkin will oversee all business operations for Lamina1, including “partnerships, fundraising efforts, developer relations and the execution of the company’s product roadmap,” the company wrote.  Barkin joined Lamina1 in August as the company’s president, a title she will also continue to hold.  Lamina1, the brainchild of science-fiction author Neal Stephenson and global blockchain expert Peter Vessenes, was first teased in June as the foundation for an open metaverse.  The team launched the Lamina1 Ecosystem Fund (L1EF) late last year to broaden Web3 builders’ access to investors by equipping builders with tools to raise capital for their open metaverse initiatives. The fund launched on AngelList in December and offers rolling funds, which distribute capital to projects through quarterly subscriptions.  In an investor letter penned in December, Vessenes said Lamina1 plans to invest in ""games, fashion, music, art, NFT projects, emergent AI, DeFi, GameFi, DeSoc, virtual machines, layer 2 protocols, identity, data storage, data availability, privacy, payments, DAOs, marketplaces, bridges, applications and immersive experiences.""  Stephenson will continue to serve as chairman of Lamina1 while Vessenes will continue in the role of executive chairman, the company wrote. The company plans to release its testnet to its community in the coming months.  Barkin has built an impressive career leading strategies for companies focused on computer vision, AI and VR companies.

42421400,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnzsD,1674678600,Crypto Diversification Is Back in 2023,"Throughout 2022, cryptocurrencies and stocks – specifically growth tech stocks – moved more in lockstep than they did in 2020-2021. That can be explained by similar, shared investor types and overlapping investment views that called for positioning toward future technology adoption despite the risk of uncertain and unpredictable future cash flows.  Whatever the case, the dramatic rise in interest rates in 2022 had a meaningful impact on growth-oriented portfolios. Investors’ time horizons collapsed from more than five years out to the near term. Today, investors are making current cash flows and profits a priority over potential growth prospects. Bull market buzzwords – fear of missing out, moon bags, laser eyes, stonks go up, and financial independence, retire early – are out of vogue, replaced by mundane things like holding on, dollar cost averaging and the collective hope for transitory inflation.  With this sudden change in mentality gripping crypto investors unaccustomed to inflation or a persistent bear market, crypto started trading interchangeably with other risky assets. (See rolling correlations to key exchange-traded funds in Figure 1):  Fortunately, crypto and other assets are going their own way in 2023, with the bitcoin/Nasdaq (QQQ) correlation down to levels last seen in 2021. Correlations to gold (as represented by the GLD ETF) and bonds (the TLT ETF) have slipped back to around zero, meaning no real relationship. Diversification is back.  A useful analogy for correlation changing under market stress would be to imagine yourself standing outside your house when it’s on fire. Amid shock and disbelief, you lose any semblance of nuance or long-term perspective. The only thing that matters is who’s inside the house and who’s safe outside. Few people ever plan for these circumstances, and for those who do, as Mike Tyson famously said, “Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face.”  Only once the flames subside can we begin to make calm and reasoned decisions. That’s happening now as crypto prices surge. My inner contrarian initially wrote off this move higher as a bear market short squeeze, but futures positioning data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (see Figure 2) tells a different story. Over the past three weeks, there has been an uptick in open interest from the real-money crowd (i.e., asset managers), while the fast-money crowd (“leveraged funds” in CFTC parlance) doesn’t appear to be overstretched and therefore vulnerable to a short squeeze. That suggests the rally is durable.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | COMMODITY | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Todd Groth,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/01/25/crypto-diversification-is-back-in-2023,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b7223c08b344c70565129f8092bff616d1f98149-4446x3334.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

While most metaverse experiences exist entirely in digital spaces, whether it be November’s Metaverse Music Festival or March’s Metaverse Fashion Week, Pedigree’s activation is focused on creating long-term impact outside of the metaverse.  The FOSTERVERSE activation will allow users to foster virtual dogs on the metaverse platform Decentraland. In order to participate, owners of virtual land in Decentraland can choose any available dog from pet adoption site Adopt a Pet and upload avatars based on their photos to the platform.  Those who don’t own land in Decentraland can still interact with the virtual pets, including chatting with other users to learn more about the real-world dogs, donating to the Pedigree Foundation to help other pets in need or adopting their real-world counterparts.  According to a report from Shelter Animals Count, just over half of dogs in shelters are finding new homes these days. By giving users an opportunity to foster pets in a virtual space, the hope is that they might be more inclined to adopt a dog in real life.  Pedigree will also match up to $100,000 in donations to support the Pedigree Foundation, focusing on helping fund foster programs for shelters around the country.  ""Both the Pedigree brand and Pedigree Foundation have long histories of supporting animal shelters and promoting dog adoption, and this program enables people to support deserving dogs in a new way through virtual fostering,” said Jean-Paul Jansen, vice president of marketing for Mars Petcare North America, in a press release.

During a parliamentary session in Dublin on Wednesday, Gabriel Makhlouf told Irish lawmakers that the Central Bank was “very concerned” about the risks retail customers face when investing in “unbacked” cryptocurrencies, according to a report from Bloomberg.  Makhlouf added that cryptocurrency has “no social value whatsoever,” but he ultimately took a more laissez-faire attitude toward allowing retail investors to purchase crypto.  “When you gamble, you can win, but most of the time when you gamble, you’re actually losing,” Makhlouf said, according to Bloomberg. “If people want to gamble, we should let them gamble.”  Reuters quoted Makhlouf as saying that “unbacked crypto is essentially a Ponzi scheme. People who put their money into unbacked crypto – and most of the significant stock of crypto out there is essentially unbacked – they are essentially gambling.”  With respect to crypto, the Central Bank of Ireland is more concerned about its risks to retail investors – particularly young investors – than systemic risks to financial stability, which Makhlouf said were “minimal.”  To better protect investors, Makhlouf reportedly suggested that advertising cryptocurrencies to young adults should be banned – if lawmakers can “find a way.”  This isn't the first time Ireland’s Central Bank has warned against the dangers of crypto advertising.

She said legislation is moving at a quicker pace in other parts of the world. For example, the European Union’s sweeping Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) legislation, if adopted, would give its 27 member countries more robust crypto rules. A vote on of the legislation, however, has been postponed until April.  Other jurisdictions, including the U.K., Australia and Hong Kong, are developing and “coming out with consultations,” according to Jeng. But ""mixed signals"" still exists in some parts of the world, she said. In Asia, for instance, Hong Kong is interested in opening its retail market to crypto, while Singapore would prefer closing it.  “Whoever is a first mover gets to influence the regulations of the rest of the world,” Jeng said.  Getting regulatory clarity for crypto is good for the industry and may also give crypto startups the “ability to access banking infrastructure.” Being able to start a bank account could “resolve the uncertainty” startups have when it comes time to explain their product to regulators.  See also: Matt Homer – Crypto Gets the Regulation It Deserves  But it isn’t too late for the U.S., she said.  “We still have a chance,” Jeng said. “If [the U.S.] wants to be the leading digital economy in the world, then we need rules of the road, not just for crypto, but for our private data,” she said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/01/25/us-needs-rules-of-the-road-for-crypto-or-risk-falling-behind-in-market-leadership,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4b64b58edc41c45db429b958dea86a8aa19bb526-5472x3648.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

MakerDAO To Generate Yields From Yearn Finance Vault Following the approval of the MIP92 (Maker Improvement Proposal 92), MakerDAO plans to begin depositing $100 million USDC to the Yearn finance vault to earn a 2% yield annually, approximately $2 million every year on its YearnFi investment. Related Reading: MakerDAO Could Replace Governance Token, Will It Provide Enhanced Incentives? Founded by prominent DeFi developer Andre Cronje, Yearn finance is a yield aggregator built on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing users to deposit crypto assets in the service in exchange for yield or interest over some time. With a total of 95,666.284 of Maker’s native token, MKR cast in the vote, approximately 68,462 MKR, which accounts for 71.56%, voted in favor of deploying USDC in Yearn Finance, while 27,204 MKR, which accounts for 28.44% voted out the whole idea and 0.0% voted “abstain.” Though the MIP92 has been passed, the proposal still has to go through an executive vote for the concept to be implemented. MakerDAO Attraction To USDC Before the MIP92 submission, MakerDAO had already demonstrated interest in Circle’s dollar-backed token, USDC. Late last year, the DAI stablecoin operator invested a hefty amount alongside collaboration with Coinbase to become the largest stakeholder in USDC. As reported by NewsBTC, MakerDAO and Coinbase Prime have a total of USD 1.6 billion in custody, allowing both partners to earn 1.5% returns from the deposited assets. Notably, stablecoins have seen rapid growth in recognition in recent years. As a result, investors now rely on these assets to protect the value of their investments. Related Reading: MakerDAO Invests Hefty Amount Becoming The Largest Stake Holder In USDC Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, which fluctuate now and then, stablecoins are tied to the value of an underlying asset, like the U.S. dollar. Due to the nature of stablecoins, many investors have found them enticing, especially as a vital part of future finance. With the USDC still lagging behind USDT in adoption, the goal has always been to surpass the latter and become number one in the market cap. Veering back to MakerDAO, the protocol’s native token, MKR, has also been thriving to cover the gaps between its current price and its all-time high. Over the past 30 days, MKR has surged more than 20% and currently trades above $650 with a 24-hour trading volume of $22.3 million.

The token, APT, reached $16.46 and is up 350% since Jan. 1, according to CoinDesk data.  APT was more recently changing hands at $16.22, a more than 25% gain over the past 24 hours.  The token’s rally has outsized recent moves from the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, bitcoin and ether. Bitcoin is up 30% in 2023, while ether has gained 34%.  The funding rates for the token are still negative, however, suggesting traders are expecting the rally to be short-lived.  “If traders are willing to open short positions with highly negative funding rates, they must have belief the token will decline,” Christopher Newhouse, a crypto derivatives trader at crypto market maker GSR, said. “Despite the surge, this suggests shorts think the rally may have gone too far.”  Aptos was founded by two Ex-Meta Platforms employees and has garnered some scrutiny over its APT token distribution since launching mainnet in October. Investors and the Aptos Foundation received almost half the one billion tokens issued.

The issue, according to Ver, is the failure by Genesis to provide the requested assurances about its finances.  Ver provided the comments to CoinDesk in a Telegram chat – and also posted them on Reddit and Twitter – after he was accused by a unit of Genesis Global this week in a New York state court filing of failing to settle cryptocurrency options trades. The unit, GGC International, seeks at least $20.9 million in damages related to the matter.  Genesis Global filed for bankruptcy protection last week. (Genesis is a unit of Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)  “I have sufficient funds on hand to pay Genesis the sums allegedly owed, and I’m happy to pay what I actually owe,” wrote Ver, who now advocates for the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. “However, Genesis was required by our agreement to remain solvent – as Genesis can’t ask its clients to play a ‘Heads clients lose, tails Genesis wins’ game.”  According to Ver, he asked Genesis in June “for assurances of their solvency.”  “In return, Genesis provided me with financial information that has been called into question by recent events,” Ver wrote. “When I asked Genesis to clarify the financial information they had provided me they refused, and instead chose to file suit.”  Ver said he “hoped to obtain this information from them quickly and amicably, as I value our relationship, but it appears I will now be forced to get to the bottom of this in discovery.”  Asked why any concerns about Genesis’ finances would affect his willingness to pay the amount owed, Ver said he wouldn't “be commenting more at the moment.”  A Genesis press representative didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.",NEUTRAL,BCH,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/01/25/bitcoin-jesus-says-he-has-the-money-to-pay-ailing-crypto-lender-genesis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f1ac289da604a1f0913f6875a574712fe53ec7e7-480x360.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Cardano In The Olympus Of Development Activity Data from research firm Santiment indicates that the Cardano ecosystem is vibrating with development activity. Currently, this blockchain ranks number 3 in the metric, according to the number of commits on the software development platform GitHub. As seen in the chart below, Cardano’s development activity over the past 30 days records over 330 GitHub commits for the different projects on this blockchain. Only Polkadot and its experimental environment Kusama have seen more development activity, with 441 commits. As the chart above shows, the price of Cardano (ADA) has been moving in tandem with its developments and the general market sentiment. As more developers onboard the blockchain, the ecosystem is more appealing to investors. ADA records a 38% rally over the past 30 days. In the coming weeks, this blockchain will deploy a new upgrade for its smart contract programming language, Plutus. This update will enable support for the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) and Schnorr. These new components will allow developers to provide more security and build cross-chain capabilities. Plutus was designed to operate as an easy-to-use and accessible programming language.

42421385,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnzbh,1674666576,Why Is Crypto Bouncing Back?,"Blue-chip crypto assets including bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) have had a very nice 2023 so far, with BTC up roughly 36% since the New Year and ETH up close to 30%. There’s growing reason to think that “the bottom is in” for crypto markets, and some macroeconomic data suggests this year will be much brighter for the sector than 2022’s 50-car pileup of scams and catastrophes.  That’s probably the most compelling argument for the crypto bottom: that bad actors and the consequences of their contagion-spreading leverage plays have been flushed out. Certainly on an emotional level, getting rid of the likes of Alex Mashinsky, Do Kwon, Three Arrows Capital and Sam Bankman-Fried feels like the chance for a new beginning.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  That new beginning, crucially, is starting from a stronger baseline thanks to the wave of COVID-19 pandemic-driven education and enthusiasm, despite the wave of frauds that closed out the last bull. Bitcoin hit a local bottom of just under $16,000 back on Nov. 9, 2022, which, despite the huge drawdown from late 2021 highs, was still 66% up from prices as recently as September 2020.  See also: David Z. Morris – Time to Decide: Are You an Investor or a Gambler?  That’s a lesson well worth learning – crypto assets have continued their decade-plus trend of steady, though volatile, growth. While there are some significant regulatory risks on the table this year, that basic trend appears to be continuing, minus the spike of 2021’s mania and the leverage-thirsty grifters who rode it into oblivion.  America’s soft landing (maybe?)  Still, while getting rid of scammers should mean we’ve cleared some major downside tail risks, it hardly amounts to grounds for a new crypto bull market. Instead, what will matter most over the next year are macroeconomic conditions, particularly the impact of inflation and interest rates on crypto and other risky assets. (Though as we’ll get into, that dynamic itself may be a primrose path to disappointment.)  The inflation picture is complex worldwide, but the current rally in BTC and ETH seem to reflect a rising sense that America specifically is on a path to not only whipping inflation, but maybe even to a “soft landing” that stops inflation without crushing jobs.  Observers in 2022 seemed to have fully given up on the “transient inflation” thesis that Chair Jerome Powell and the Federal Reserve tried to sell back in 2021. But arguably, in retrospect, inflation has proven pretty transient, driven at least as much by supply chain and commodity disruptions as by the base money supply. U.S. inflation has now fallen for six straight months.  The month-over-month numbers for December are particularly upbeat, with the consumer price index (CPI) actually dropping by 0.1% on the month. Some household essentials are even undershooting the Fed’s 2% inflation target, with grocery prices rising at just 0.2% month over month, and gasoline prices down 9.4% on the month. That’s not enough to erase the steep inflation over the past year-plus, but it does move us closer to a new stable baseline.  That has led to widespread expectations that the Fed will soften its interest rate hiking agenda. The four consecutive rate hikes of 0.75% in 2022 were historically aggressive, but the market has now fully priced in expectations of a gentle 0.25% hike in February, with the chance of no hikes at all in the back half of the year.  It might seem surprising that any hike at all is on the table given that we now have month-over-month deflation, but in fact it highlights another positive data point. The Fed still needs to keep some pressure on simply because jobs numbers are still strong, with the most recent report maintaining historically low unemployment at 3.5%, but also some slowing in wage growth.  That’s nearly a Goldilocks-caliber “just right” in macroeconomic terms, presenting the real possibility of a fabled “soft landing” that brings inflation under control without catastrophically stalling the economy and putting workers in the street. In turn, that’s great news for risk-on speculative assets like crypto.  Euro-China muddling  The situation in Europe is more complicated, as former CoinDesker Noelle Acheson examines in the most recent edition of her newsletter, Crypto is Macro Now. European manufacturing and services indexes for January beat expectations, suggesting the first return to positive economic growth in the zone since June.  But Europe may not be as likely to get a soft landing as the U.S. The European Central Bank, seemingly still concerned about inflation, has signaled a continuation of more aggressive rate hikes in the coming months.  That’s still a far better outlook than in the third big axis of global economic activity, China. The country continues teetering on the edge of something darker than inflation, or even mere recession. First, though COVID-19 infections have now fallen dramatically since the surprise end of “Zero-COVID” lockdowns in December, more disruptive surges seem likely to be in the cards.  Even worse, China still faces an ongoing housing crash that threatens the very foundations of its still-developing financial system. Following a crackdown on indebted and corrupt developers in 2020, housing prices have continued slumping – in fact, the decline accelerated in December. That’s potentially catastrophic, because housing makes up a disproportionate 45% of Chinese household wealth compared to a more typical 25% in the U.S., according to Federal Reserve data. That means declining home prices are very, very bad for Chinese consumption.  China’s fate is not a particularly direct input into crypto markets, given the broad anti-crypto crackdown still in effect there. But its outsized impact on the global economy means it has big downstream implications. Those impacts could include COVID disruptions so severe that they continue to disrupt Chinese manufacturing, possibly making inflation worse globally. On the other hand, a housing-driven Chinese recession could ease global price pressures – but also drag down global growth and economic enthusiasm.  The anti-speculative impulse  Having discussed interest rates and price pressures, I feel compelled to point out the problem inherent in that focus. Crypto investors worried primarily about central bank interest rates are implicitly focused on speculative drivers of crypto price, including rising competition for dollars from safe investments like Treasury bonds.  But it may be time to turn away from that mindset. One version of the 2020-2022 story in crypto is that the early pandemic saw legions of new participants learning about crypto during COVID lockdowns in 2020, which in turn created a speculative mania in 2021 that then popped in 2022.  See also: David Z. Morris – There's Less Money in Crypto, and That's a Good Thing  In a perfect world, we’d have continued curiosity and real user adoption, without the manias or the blowups.

8148876,https://newsbtc.com/?p=517428,1674666014,"Here’s What Might Have Triggered Ethereum’s Decline Below $1,600","After what has been two weeks of an incredible rally for the price of Ethereum, the digital asset seems to be running out of steam. ETH’s price has now declined once more below $1,600 after a sharp downturn on Tuesday. The culprit for this seems to be growing FUD across the community. FUD Could Have Been The Trigger According to Santiment, the social dominance of Ethereum grew rapidly in the last couple of days. While this can sometimes be a good thing, it tells a negative story this time around. Ethereum is now dominating 21% of cryptocurrency discussion on social media and the on-chain data aggregator says this might be evidence that FUD might be behind the dip. However, this may not be the only reason. Related Reading: Money Leaves ADA, SOL To Small Cap Altcoins, Here’s Where It’s Headed A report from Bitcoinist had previously shown that profit-taking in large assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum had been ramping up with the increase in price. Santiment also highlights this in its post, pointing to the spike in the profit-taking ratio on January 20. Taking this in concert with the growing FUD, it presents a recipe for disaster for the digital asset. ETH social dominance indicates FUD | Source: Santiment Another prominent event was the Wormhole attacker started moving the stolen funds around. On Monday, the attacker moved over $155 million in ETH to OpenOcean which they proceeded to exchange for staked ETH tokens such as stETH and wstETH. The dumping of these coins on the open market saw sell pressure mount on ETH during this time. It contributed to the already declining momentum, resulting in the current dip in the price. Can Ethereum Recover From Here? Despite the recent decline, the overall sentiment for Ethereum is still skewing largely toward buy. This is because the cryptocurrency is still trading well above its 50-day and 100-day moving averages. And even with the decline, it continues to trend around its 200-day moving average. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Price Could See Another 30% Rally What this shows is that, at least in the short to mid-term, there is still a lot of bullish sentiment surrounding the digital asset.

ETH price falls below $1,600 | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com Investors are also seeing good profits during this time with 57% of all holders in profit. Figures like these also help to push a bullish narrative for the digital asset as more investors try to take advantage of the dip and move into the green. Overall, as long as ETH maintains its momentum and trading volume continues rising, it’ll retest the $1,600 resistance once more. ETH’s price is changing hands at $1,555 at the time of this writing. Its price is down 5.27% in the last 24 hours but trading volume is up 11.91% over the same time period to be sitting at $9.32 billion.

Williams Jr., CMT  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Bitcoin Failed as an Inflation Hedge. But It Was Nonetheless a Hedge  You need not look hard to find people calling bitcoin (BTC) a hedge against inflation, something that should rise in price if inflation is high. For years, that was a common refrain, and it still is in some places. And yet the past year suggests that's not true. Bitcoin has lost more than two-thirds of its value amid the toughest bout of inflation in four decades. Some hedge.  But I think bitcoin was a hedge against something else: inept central bank policy. It’s a seed of an idea that Renzo Anfossi, a senior trader at Arca Funds, planted in my head during a conversation recently – and I believe it explains a lot.  Federal Reserve officials spent months in 2021 saying red-hot inflation would prove transitory. Chairman Jerome Powell didn’t change course until November of that year, when he backed away from calling it a passing phenomenon. Bitcoin skyrocketed up until that point as policymakers appeared to be in denial.  The Federal Reserve poured money into the financial system to prop it up during the pandemic. M2, a measure of the money supply, jumped dramatically from about $15.5 trillion in March 2020 to a peak last year of $22 trillion. The Fed also knocked its main policy rate target down to zero. Dumping all this cash into the system and engaging in unconstrained monetary policy encouraged questionable risk-taking in markets. Bitcoin’s rise was a clear barometer that something irresponsible was going on.  Then bitcoin crashed. It is not, I would argue, a surprise that this largely coincided with the Fed starting to raise rates a year ago – aka getting more responsible. Now, the end of Fed rate hikes to suppress inflation appears to be in sight. The central bank's target rate is now 4.5%, and policymakers have suggested 5% or so will mark the end of their campaign. M2 has fallen some, slipping to almost $21 trillion. The yield curve comparing two-year and 10-year Treasurys remains inverted at about minus 69 basis points, but that's an improvement from minus 84 basis points in early December – a sign of movement toward a more normal economy.  Bitcoin has soared early this year, surpassing $23,000 after being below $17,000 as recently as Jan. 8. Is that a sign of more central bank ineptitude? Not in the U.S., where it seems inflation is getting under control as the easy-money days appear to be far in the past.  What I think is happening is we're entering a period where bitcoin trades on multiple narratives. In the U.S., it’s being viewed as a tool for speculation and something valued for the technology that undergirds it.  Elsewhere in the world, ineptitude could remain a driving force for bitcoin investors. The Chainanalysis 2022 Geography of Cryptocurrency report highlights bitcoin adoption rates around the globe. Not surprisingly, a number of countries that are using bitcoin the most are saddled with numerous issues specific to monetary policy. Venezuela and Argentina, which have key interest rates above 60% and inflation near or above 100%, stand out in particular.  The U.S.-style speculative approach and central bank ineptitude angle seen elsewhere can both be bullish for bitcoin. Things have been considerably bullish in crypto recently, and not just for bitcoin. Bitcoin is up 37% this year and ether (ETH) is up 36%.  How bitcoin ultimately behaves as an asset is yet to be seen. It remains relatively young, and opinions vary by the audience. The goal of “Crypto Long & Short” will be to highlight those views, so that they can be acted upon.  Takeaways  Here’s some news, from CoinDesk's Nick Baker, you should know about:  APTOS’ APTITUDE: The crypto rally is far from limited to the BTCs and ETHs of the cryptosphere. A terrific example of that is the huge jump in the APT token from Aptos, the vaunted Solana-killer (which was itself been pitched as an Ethereum-killer), as well as the increased interest in the shiba inu token (SHIB). Who knows if that’s sustainable, but risk is being sought in more far-flung corners of crypto.  YES, BUT WHEN?: Pantera Capital, a crypto investment and venture-capital firm with about $3.8 billion of assets under management, is looking toward the future, writing recently that it sees the business of finance moving over to blockchain infrastructure. It’s an old idea at this point with, frankly, not much real progress, but Pantera isn’t the only player still confident it’ll happen eventually. Hopes that traditional finance and crypto will intersect remain eternal.  MORE WAITING: Here’s another immortal idea: Crypto regulation is coming. There’s no question FTX’s collapse adds urgency to a topic that’s been talked about and talked about and talked about. Don’t forget, though, that a CoinDesk deep dive showed one in three members of the U.S. Congress have received money from FTX officials like Sam Bankman-Fried, creating awkwardness amid any regulatory push.  JUST ANOTHER DAY: Crypto lender Genesis (CoinDesk’s corporate sibling) recently fell into bankruptcy court. An on-chain analysis reveals, though, that the separate Genesis trading division is showing some semblance of normalcy.

42410863,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggsCaC,1674664910,"Indonesia Regulatory Switch Could See Crypto Classed as Securities, Not Commodities","A new Indonesian law that transfers crypto regulatory powers to the Financial Services Authority (OJK) from commodities watchdog CoFTRA indicates a shift in the country’s approach to policing the industry and an acknowledgement that there’s more to it than asset trading.  The law, signed by Indonesian President Joko Widodo on Jan. 12, is a financial regulations overhaul that modified at least 17 outdated local laws to align with technological developments. It could end up changing the country’s unique classification of crypto assets as commodities like gold or coal – something Widodo’s government was, just last year, hoping to leverage to benefit the local economy.  Read more: Indonesia Has Global Plans for Local Crypto Tokens  According to Indonesia’s blockchain trade association, ABI, the switch in regulators is a sign that the country sees promise in the technologies that underlie crypto, especially as the OJK will supervise the industry under its “Financial Sector Technological Innovation” measures.  “We must admit that this shift has shown a good understanding from the regulator that crypto assets are broader than just trading,” ABI Chair Asih Karnengsih wrote in a statement to CoinDesk.  Indonesia was one of 2022’s fastest-growing crypto markets, driven primarily by speculative trading. Last year, the country’s trade ministry recorded around 14 million crypto traders against 9 million stock traders.  Being treated as commodities has kept crypto out of the debate over which digital assets should be treated like traditional securities, something regulators and industry members in other economies like the U.S. are still arguing about.  “The shifting connotes that crypto assets may be treated similarly to securities and bring about the application of the whole array of securities-related requirements and restrictions in their offering, sales, market, and mutual funds,” Karnengsih said.  The government says regulatory changeover will take two years, said Jay Jayawijayaningtiyas, country manager for crypto exchange Luno Indonesia, adding that it’s too early to speculate how the assets will be regulated by the new authority. Luno is owned by CoinDesk’s parent company DCG, and is a member of the ABI.  The change in regulators – and the implication that the OJK’s scope will differ from the commodities regulator – could benefit the industry's development, Karnengsih said.  For one, CoFTRA required exchanges operating in the country to submit periodic reports on transactions conducted on their platforms. In September, CoinDesk wrote about difficulties and delays faced by local token issuers to make it onto CoFTRA’s list of approved tokens. Now, the country will go ahead with plans to set up a national crypto exchange – complete with an index – similar to stock exchange platforms like NYSE, which is expected to make it easier for regulators to monitor market activities broadly.  “This centralized exchange will play a significant role in market [supervision] and development, especially in deciding the product offered by Exchangers,” Karnengsih said.

Bitcoin Short-Term Holder SOPR Has Surged Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, instances of the current trend have led to declines in the crypto’s price in the past. The relevant indicator here is the “Spent Output Profit Ratio” (SOPR), which tells us whether the average Bitcoin investor is selling their coins at a profit or at a loss right now. When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the holders as a whole are realizing some profits on their selling currently. On the other hand, values below the threshold suggest the overall market is leaning towards loss realization at the moment. Naturally, the indicator being exactly equal to 1 implies the average holder is just breaking even on their distribution right now. One of the two main segments of the BTC market is made up of the “short-term holders” (STHs), which is a cohort that includes all investors who acquired their coins within the last 155 days. The holders who have been sitting on their coins for more than this threshold amount are called “long-term holders” (LTHs). Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin SOPR specifically for the STHs: The value of the metric seems to have risen in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin STH SOPR (as well as its 7-day moving average) has surged and broken above 1 recently. This means that as the BTC rally has taken place, the STHs have come into profits and they are now selling to harvest these gains. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Declines 6%, Gets Flipped By Litecoin In Market Cap Again The chart also includes data for the 7-day triple exponential average (TRIX) of the STH SOPR. The TRIX is a momentum oscillator that shows the percentage change in a metric’s moving average after smoothening it exponentially three times (hence the name). From the chart, it’s visible that during this bear market, whenever the STH SOPR 7-day TRIX has hit a positive top, the price of Bitcoin has noticed a local top formation as well and has subsequently gone down. It looks like most recently, the 7-day TRIX of the STH SOPR has shot up again, and the metric seems to be curving inside now, potentially moving toward a top formation. This pattern looks similar to the instances seen earlier in the bear market, which could suggest this Bitcoin rally may be heading toward the same fate as those previous ones. Though that would be only if the pattern does complete and the indicator makes the top. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Bitcoin Price Rally Stalled For Now The analyst has also posted the chart for the 2018-2019 bear market, to see how the current rally compares with that of April 2019. The trend in the STH SOPR 7-day TRIX in the 2018-2019 bear market | Source: CryptoQuant Interestingly, the rally of April 2019 only felt a short-term pullback from the first big spike in the indicator; it was only with the second spike that the price topped out. There have been some similarities between the current rally and that of April 2019 already, which may mean that the current one could also shrug off this first spike in the indicator and continue its momentum, just like the past rally.

Duncan Cock Foster, who founded Nifty Gateway with his twin brother Griffin Cock Foster in 2019, tweeted Wednesday about the departure.  “Some news – after almost 4 years, @gcockfoster and I are departing @gemini and are passing the baton at @niftygateway,” he wrote. “This journey has been an incredible ride, but Griffin and I are founders at heart and we want to start another company.”  Duncan Cock Foster said he and his brother would be replaced by vice president of engineering Eddie Ma as technical leader, and director of collector services and growth Tara Harris as non-tech leader. He added that he and Griffin would continue with the company as advisers to ensure continuity.  Gemini acquired Nifty Gateway in late 2019, with Duncan and Griffin teaming with another set of twins at Gemini – co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss – to provide the back-end infrastructure to allow traders to purchase NFTs with fiat.  NFT trading volumes have fallen 94% in the past year, however, and Gemini has faced a series of challenges, notably having to halt withdrawals by its Earn customers because of problems at its partner on the product, Genesis Global Capital. Genesis filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last week, with documents showing that it owes $766 million to Gemini. (The parent company of Genesis is Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk).  On Monday, Gemini laid off 10% more of its staff, following two rounds of layoffs that began last summer.  Duncan Cock-Foster said in his tweet thread that he and his brother’s immediate plans are to take a break.  ""Our first step will be to take a sabbatical, digest what has happened over the five years since we started Nifty Gateway, and start brainstorming new startup ideas,” he wrote.

""Inflation is projected to come down significantly this year,"" said the BoC in its policy statement. ""If economic developments evolve broadly in line with the [bank's] outlook, Governing Council expects to hold the policy rate at its current level while it assesses the impact of the cumulative interest rate increases.""  Down for the day alongside a broad sell-off in risk assets, bitcoin (BTC) showed little reaction to the BoC's dovish statement, but it's a potentially bullish development. Like the U.S. Federal Reserve, the BoC in 2022 embarked on a series of aggressive rate hikes to try and cool speedy inflation.  This sharply tighter monetary policy by the Fed, BoC and other western central banks was an important factor in the brutal bear market for bitcoin last year that saw the price decline from just shy of $50,000 to nearly $15,000 before closing 2022 at $16,500.  The Fed's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets next week and – like the BoC – is widely expected to hike rates by just 25 basis points (versus 50 basis points at the previous meeting and 75 prior to that). Should the FOMC surprise by also signaling its intent to pause its rate hike regime, that news would be far less likely to be ignored by the crypto markets.

42411257,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMVwN,1674661456,The Pluses and Minuses of Regulating Crypto as Gambling,"In the wake of FTX's shocking collapse, a new idea for regulating crypto has begun to take form: Let's regulate crypto like we regulate gambling.  Todd Baker, a Senior Fellow at the Richman Center for Business, Law and Public Policy at Columbia University, recently writes that ""crypto trading should be regulated for what it is – gambling emulating finance and not what its advocates say it is or what people believe it to be.""  This opinion article is part of CoinDesk's Policy Week.  The European Central Bank's Fabio Panetta suggests that ""regulation should acknowledge the speculative nature of unbacked cryptos and treat them as gambling activities."" And here is a recent American Banker article on the topic.  There are some good aspects to the idea of regulating crypto as gambling, and some bad.  First, the bad.  Crypto is too diverse for one regulatory framework  Any claim that we should regulate crypto as X isn't very helpful, and that's because the stuff we call ""crypto"" has long ceased to be a single-issue product that can be conveniently boxed into any one framework. Maybe back in 2012 and 2013 it could have been. And gambling might very well have been the best fit back then.  But, at its core, crypto consists of a bunch of programmable databases, which means they can host all sorts of applications – not just gambling applications. Zoom forward to 2022 and the range of activities occurring in the crypto space has become quite broad and diverse.  Take MakerDAO, for instance. MakerDAO is built on a blockchain, and so it falls under the “crypto” umbrella. But it isn't a gambling product. Functionally, MakerDAO is a bank that makes loans by issuing deposits in the form of dai (DAI), a stablecoin.  To make things more complicated, ownership of MakerDAO is represented in the form of MKR tokens, also residing on a blockchain, which allow holders to vote on how the bank operates. MKR also provides holders with a claim on bank earnings. In effect, MKR tokens are like shares in Wells Fargo or Bank of Montreal. They are investments.  Read more: Jesse Hamilton - After FTX: How Congress Is Gearing Up to Regulate Crypto  To regulate MakerDAO and the tokens associated with it – DAI and MKR – as gambling products just wouldn't make sense, for the same reason that regulating Wells Fargo or its underlying shares as a casino would be a clumsy fit.  Or take decentralized tools Aave and Compound, which have been built on blockchains. Both are lenders. While these two tools certainly service a gambling clientele, they aren't themselves gambling apps and shouldn't fall into that category.  Or consider centralized exchanges such as Coinbase. Coinbase lets customers directly buy and sell crypto with cash, combining in one platform the roles of a traditional broker like E-Trade with a trading venue like Nasdaq. However, we apply securities regulation to E-Trade and Nasdaq, not gambling regulation, and should probably do the same for Coinbase.  In sum, to regulate crypto it'll take more nuance than just throwing it all into the gambling category. There are many different existing regulatory frameworks that can be applied to emergent blockchain-based products, of which gambling is just one.  Next, here’s what’s good about regulating crypto as gambling.  A long overdue recognition of crypto problem gambling  Dai, MKR, Aave and Compound may not be gambling. But a large proportion of crypto is gambling. That's because a big chunk of the people who engage with blockchains are doing little more than betting on the very volatile prices of first-generation unbacked volcoins like dogecoin, floki inu, and shiba inu. Let's not forget bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, xrp, and ether.  The crypto industry has tried its hardest to elevate volcoin betting from gambling to ""investing."" Coinbase, for instance, loftily sees its mission as to ""increase economic freedom in the world.""  But if you look under the hood, a volcoin such as dogecoin is little more than a never-ending 24/7 lottery on what average opinion thinks the price of dogecoin will be. This same recursive betting process is what drives the prices of bitcoin, litecoin and other volcoins. Users can sell their position in these never-ending lotteries to other players, and in some cases the casino chips get used as a payment token – but the payments functionality of volcoins has always run a distant second to their primary lottery function.  Read more: Amitoj Singh - India Has Clamped Down on Crypto. What Will It Do With Its G-20 Power?  The benefit of officially recognizing volcoin-based betting as a form of gambling is that it would import into the world of crypto society’s already-existing protections for problem gamblers and children.  Problem gambling is a disorder characterized by a persistent and uncontrollable urge to gamble despite negative consequences or attempts to stop. It can lead to financial difficulties, relationship problems, and mental health issues such as depression and anxiety.  In many jurisdictions, gambling operators are required to address problem gambling by implementing self-exclusion programs that allow customers to voluntarily ban themselves from gambling establishments or betting sites. By regulating volcoins as gambling, venues that offer these products – say like Coinbase, PayPal and Kraken – would be required to set up exclusion programs of their own.  Gambling venues are often required by law to display responsible gambling messages such as ""Play Responsibly. Remember, it’s just a game."" The MegaMillions play responsibly page, for instance, provides information about problem gambling and a confidential 24-hour hotline.  Applying these messaging standards to crypto, it would no longer be permissible to represent volcoin purchases to clients as a form of investment. Rather, venues like Coinbase and PayPal would have to provide disclaimers along the lines as: ""Play bitcoin responsibly. Remember, it’s just a game.""  In many jurisdictions, a recognition of volcoins as gambling would limit opportunities for public advertising. In 2021, ads for floki inu flooded London. ""Missed Doge? Get Floki,"" the ads said, appealing to peoples’ base fears of missing out. However, the United Kingdom has a very strict code surrounding gambling advertisements. Had floki and other volcoins been properly categorized at the outset as betting games, then floki’s advertising campaign would have had to pass many more hurdles.  Or take Matt Damon's notorious ""fortune favors the brave '' ad for Crypto.com from early 2022. The ad tried to analogize volcoin buyers to intrepid explorers. By regulating volcoins as betting, ad creators could no longer draw these sorts of dubious analogies in an attempt to attract bettors to their platforms.  In particular, gambling regulatory frameworks in places such as the U.K. explicitly prevent gambling operators from reaching out to children through advertising. If volcoin betting were to be deemed a form of gambling, then crypto platforms that court users under the age of 18 (say like Block and Kraken have done in the past) would be required to put an end to this practice.  Finally, some U.S. states limit the ability of gamblers to fund their activities by credit, as does the United Kingdom. The idea is to prevent a problem gambler's addiction from snowballing into a much larger crisis for the family's finances. Translating this rule over to crypto could mean no longer allowing customers to buy volcoins with credit cards and/or restricting access to margin.  To sum up, the idea of applying crypto regulation to crypto needs to be fleshed out. There are many blockchain-based activities that are not gambling, and shouldn't be regulated as such. But a big chunk of what occurs on blockchains is gambling, and it's about time we recognized it as such – and regulated it accordingly.",NEUTRAL,MKR,BCH | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MKR | REGULATION,JP Koning,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/01/25/crypto-regulation-gambling,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fc5afef4614f6e8c645d5e1b0fb34423e70362a0-5272x3515.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Lummis’ campaign website includes language like “Build the wall on our southern border” and “Stop the socialist agenda,” and she has proudly said that “I am decidedly and passionately pro-life.” Gillibrand, the 2020 Democratic presidential nominee, said that the battle for pro-choice abortion rights is the “biggest fight of a generation.” And yet the conservative and the liberal saw eye-to-eye on crypto, co-sponsoring the “Responsible Financial Innovation Act” that intended to establish and clarify crypto regulations.  “When you look across most of the bills last year, you do have these strange bedfellows,” says Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association, adding that it’s a mix of “progressive Democrats and conservative or libertarian Republicans.” She suspects that age is more of a determining factor than political party, as “younger members of Congress seem to grasp crypto faster and quicker than the older members of Congress.”  The Congressional Blockchain Caucus has four co-chairs: two are Republicans and two are Democrats. The caucus itself is broadly bipartisan. Both parties are being lobbied by the crypto industry and benefit from donations: A recent CoinDesk report showed that a jaw-dropping one in three members of Congress received donations from FTX-related entities alone.  So is crypto truly bipartisan? “I don’t know if I completely agree with that thesis,” says Ian Katz, managing director at the research firm Capital Alpha Partners. Katz said the partisan split in crypto is “at times less obvious than most other issues,” but adds that “I do think you can generalize and say that Republicans are more wary of crypto regulations than Democrats.”  And this might have shifted in the past three months. You can “draw a line” before and after the FTX meltdown, says Katz, in the sense that skeptical-but-silent Democrats are now being more vocal. “Post-FTX, Sherrod Brown [Democrat senator from Ohio] felt emboldened to say, ‘I told you so.’”  A comprehensive overview would be tedious – the Congressional Blockchain Caucus alone has over 40 members – but here’s a primer of who’s who in the bewildering world of the Crypto Congress:  The Pro-Crypto Camp  Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minnesota)  Crypto credentials: Co-chair of Congressional Blockchain Caucus, held the first cryptocurrency town hall, introduced the Securities Clarity Act. (Read more in my recent interview with the Congressman.)  Key quote: “The future is here and crypto has the ability to decentralize control and empower each and every one of us.”  Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-New York)  Crypto credentials: Introduced legislation to bring transparency to crypto exchanges, penned the essay “A liberal case for cryptocurrency.”  Key quote: “Crypto is the future. It could enable the poor to make payments and remittances without long delays and high fees. It could enable artists and musicians to earn a living. It could challenge the concentrated power of Big Tech and Wall Street.”  Rep. French Hill (R-Arkansas)  Crypto credentials: Skeptical of over-regulation, chair of the new Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Inclusion committee.  Key quote: “We want innovation for fintech and the use of blockchain to be available in the United States.”  Rep. Ro Khanna (D-California)  Crypto credentials: Introduced the “Keep Innovation in America Act” along with Reps. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) and Tim Ryan (D-Ohio).  Key quote: “Web 3.0 will lead to unprecedented job growth and empower Americans to have economic ownership over the internet … Congress should not crush this emerging technology nor pick winners and losers.”  Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas)  Crypto credentials: Bought up to $50K in bitcoin in early 2022.  Key quote: “I think Bitcoin means investment. It means opportunity. It means prosperity. It means financial independence. I also think the rise of bitcoin mining in Texas has an enormous positive benefit for resiliency of the grid.”  Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio)  Crypto credentials: Disclosed owning up to $250KJ worth of bitcoin  Key quote: “[Crypto] is one of the few sectors of our economy where conservatives and other free thinkers can operate without pressure from the social justice mob.”  Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-New York)  Crypto credentials: Lummis’ Democratic partner on Responsible Financial Innovation Act.  Key quote: When it comes to crypto regulation “You need basic rules of the road.”  Rep. Patrick McHenry, (R-North Carolina)  Crypto credentials: The incoming chairman of the Financial Services Committee, McHenry is a vocal opponent of over-regulation.  Key quote: “Congress must work to fully understand and embrace these innovative new technologies, like #crypto. We don’t need knee-jerk reactions by lawmakers to regulate out of fear of the unknown.”  Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R, Wyoming)  Crypto credentials: A staple at crypto conferences, dubbed the “Crypto Queen,” co-sponsor of the Responsible Financial Innovation Act, bought bitcoin in 2013.  Key quote: “I say spend dollars and save Bitcoin.”  The Crypto Skeptics/Anti-Crypto Camp  Here it gets a little trickier. While there are tons of crypto enthusiasts in both chambers and on both sides of the aisle, especially in the wake of FTX, the crypto skeptics tend to skew Democratic.  Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts)  Anti-crypto credentials: Prominent critic of the industry, introduced the “Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act,” which was seen by many in the space as a burdensome over-reach.  Key quote: “Crypto has become the preferred tool for terrorists, for ransomware gangs, for drug dealers, or rogue states that want to launder money,”  Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kansas)  Anti-crypto credentials: Warren’s co-sponsor of the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act.  Key quote: Called crypto a “national security threat” and suggested “We should be considering a pause using this as a currency.”  Rep. Brad Sherman (D-California)  Anti-crypto credentials: Called for an outright ban of crypto in the United States.  Key quote: “Bitcoin, it’s not just for narco-terrorists anymore … it’s for tax evaders, too.”  Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio)  Anti-crypto credentials: Post-FTX, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee issued a press release proudly stating that “Brown has long expressed skepticism of cryptocurrencies.”  Key quote: “We can't let thousands of risky and volatile assets that are used only for speculation and sanctions evasion into our banking system, and we know that it’s a national security issue.”  Sen. Jon Tester (D-Montana)  Anti-crypto credentials: Expressed concerns that regulating crypto might give it legitimacy.  Key quote: ""I see no reason why this stuff [crypto] should exist. I really don't.""  Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-Vermont)  Anti-crypto credentials: Worked with Warren on regulations that would make it harder for banks to engage in crypto.  Key quote: “I’m not a big fan of cryptocurrencies. Clearly, they've not shown a real public purpose for their existence. They made some people rich, they made a lot of people lose money.”  Final thoughts  This list, inevitably, will keep growing as more politicians are forced to go on the record and declare their allegiances. And while crypto is perhaps not as bipartisan as its boosters would like to imagine – with Republicans more receptive, Democrats less so – it might just be bipartisan enough to actually break a gridlock. What that actually looks like is anyone’s guess.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | REGULATION | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/01/25/crypto-policy-regulation-us-congress,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/96e1f58a447c7e396aefca2b956da5d45dbf55a7-3600x2400.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

8137491,https://newsbtc.com/?p=517492,1674660639,Why This Analyst Thinks Traders Should Not Be Bearish On Solana,"For traders thinking Solana is controlled by the bears, a popular crypto market analyst, Chris Burniske, is giving a fresh perspective of hope for the major altcoin. According to the former lead of Ark Invest’s crypto department, those who think that SOL is generally bedridden in a bearish mood are mistaken. SOL Sets To Make a Breakthrough Burniske said that the Ethereum killer still has a breakthrough opportunity to rally its price despite its reverse down at a resistance level. The prominent analyst urged traders not to be extremely bearish on SOL as the coin would eventually retrace its value. He expects the crypto’s retracement to occur within the next few months. Related Reading: Solana Keeps Positive Radiance But Bears Could Dampen The Mood At This Level Burniske, however, cautioned that investors might experience price decline due to the market volatility, which might heighten and cause massive losses for traders who have opened long positions in their leverages. Since the start of the year, Solana has been in a bullish mood and showing signs of resilience and bravery, actually benefiting from the recent market bullishness. Based on the daily and weekly trading movement since the beginning of the year, the current bearish action of SOL can be regarded as a mere retracement, something which is generally seen in other risky assets. Most Ethereum killers, including Solana, are witnessing a similar kind of price reversal, which signals no major panic on the part of the SOL price. Solana Price Analysis Shows Buy Signal Burniske’s projection seems to be right based on technical price analysis. Over the past three months, Solana moved in a sideways trajectory trend at an average price of around the $14 mark. But within the last two weeks, Solana has surged its value by over 68% to trade at an average price of $23.59. At the time of writing, Solana is currently trading at $23.18, down 5.50%, with a trading volume of $801,611,149 in the last 24 hours. The altcoin’s market cap stands at $8.6 billion, which puts it the 10th largest cryptocurrency, according to Coinmarketcap. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Outperforms Top Coins With 28% Gains On Weekly Chart As per the TradingView chart below, the presence of a bullish hammer in the candlesticks signals the buyers are taking back control and pushing the price back above. The green indicator shows the sellers’ inability to drive the price of an asset further down. The 50-day and 200-day moving average settings on the 4-hour price chart further support this bullish trend. The presence of the golden cross, as it is indicated by an asset’s short-term moving average crossing above its long-term moving average, signals a switch from a bear trend to a bull trend. Based on price analysis, the current sentiment is bullish, as this can also be seen in the RSI stands at 64.22, showing that Solana is in the bull territory. Generally, the technical analysis shows that Solana has the potential to regain its value, though it may experience some corrections triggered by macro events.

42411262,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMWCu,1674660227,"Instead of Slowing Innovation, Regulation May Drive Demand for ReFi","While the crypto industry at large generally looks forward to policy for clarity on things like what is a security and what isn’t, and also (hopefully( focus on weeding out bad actors like former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, regulations are seen as a necessary evil. That is, except in climate activist circles. Here, people in crypto are enthusiastic about how policy and regulation could become generative in their ability to accelerate the demand for and use of blockchain solutions.  In the context of the regenerative finance (ReFi) space, which I recently proclaimed would have a real breakout year in 2023, I believe policy and regulation, primarily outside of crypto regulators, will actually be a major stimulant for innovation and adoption of ReFi solutions globally.  Boyd Cohen is CEO and co-founder of Iomob, the developers of WheelCoin, a Move2Earn game that rewards users for moving green. This piece is part of CoinDesk's Policy Week 2023.  In order to explore how policy and regulation could stimulate ReFi adoption, I recently sketched the ReFi Climate Stack as a visual tool to frame the way teams are leveraging crypto rails to advance climate action.  As is the case for most blockchain stack frameworks, the ReFi Climate Stack is best utilized going from the base and moving up to the app layer.  Blockchain layer 0-2 policy support  One of the biggest achievements of crypto in 2022 was the ambitious and successful Ethereum migration from the energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to the energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism. The Merge, as it was affectionately known, raised more awareness among the public at large and policymakers around the world of the energy and carbon emissions of PoW blockchains such as Bitcoin. Indeed, most blockchains are based on PoS. In 2022 we witnessed regional and national jurisdictions including the New York State go as far as placing moratoriums on new bitcoin mining operations due to the environmental impacts and energy consumed by miners.  Blockchains such as Celo, Cosmos, Hedera, Near and Polygon have been racing to prove their carbon-neutral, or even carbon-negative, credentials in order to appeal to a range of actors who care about sustainability and climate change.  Emerging ReFi projects looking to deploy on crypto rails increasingly cite the carbon commitments of the layer 0 through layer 2 they are building on as a key factor in their decision. It is only a matter of time before this starts to find its way into legacy and Web 2 enterprise decisions as well as government evaluations of blockchain use cases.  Take, for example, major energy companies, all of whom have some type of blockchain activities under way. These same energy companies are increasingly subject to regulations on carbon emissions. When deciding which base layer to build on, you can bet every single energy company (and every other company in industries subject to carbon regulation) will seek out blockchains with low carbon credentials.  The same goes for any government initiative aiming to leverage blockchain for operations and service delivery. The number of use cases for blockchain in government are growing by the day. ConsenSys published a report on this topic highlighting the application of blockchain for smart cities, central banking, validation of citizen credentials, tracking vaccines as well as loans and student grants and for payroll tax collection. It is impossible to imagine a world where governments would not make the carbon emissions of the underlying blockchain a key criteria in their public tender and their eventual decision-making.  Thus, the broader movement to regulate carbon emissions of commercial and public action will generate real opportunities for blockchains at the base of the stack who take a lead on carbon neutrality.  ReFi financialization tools  Several blockchain projects have launched to support the funding of ReFi projects because they represent a type of public good. The open-source development platform Gitcoin was among the first to do this. Now operating as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), Gitcoin leverages quadratic funding – a form of crowdfunding – to democratize financial support of impact projects (off-chain and on-chain). Gitcoin relies on matching funds from larger donors, including governments seeking to support and fund ReFi projects that align with their own ambitions for the public good.  I am confident we will continue to see local, regional and international agencies and groups such as the United Nations embrace ReFi to help accelerate sustainable development goals. The funding may frequently flow via on-chain tools dedicated to democratizing the process while ensuring transparency of the funding choices as well as the outcomes of the use of funds.  Eco-credits and offsets  The carbon-offset industry, which has exceeded $270 billion annually, is increasingly coming under scrutiny due to the perception that a lot of it leads to greenwashing, and that many offsets are generated and retired with insufficient transparency. Dozens, if not hundreds, of ReFi projects have been born in the past few years designed to leverage crypto rails to solve the coordination and transparency problems among the different stakeholders such as project developers, investors and demand partners such as corporations, governments and end users of voluntary offsets.  KlimaDAO alone has helped facilitate the removal of 18 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2), equivalent to removing nearly 4 million cars from the road annually, on-chain data shows. Climate change policy is growing in the face of worsening impacts from climate change, and it is undeniable that a growing number of enterprises will be required (or pressured by stakeholders) to get their act together. While this will place more pressure on enterprises to reduce their own carbon emissions from operations and their supply chains (something ReFi can also help with), the use of on-chain tools to transparently engage in carbon markets will accelerate as well.  App layer  As the layer closest to end users, ReFi can play its part in helping to onboard the next billion users by creating engaging apps, non-fungible tokens (NFT) and metaverse products that make going green fun. Yet, where I predict the most interest and attention from policymakers at this layer of the ReFi Climate Stack is actually on the metaverse. As ConsenSys highlighted in its report, smart cities are an area of increasing interest for governments and blockchain projects.  Within smart cities, digital twins and the metaverse are very hot. Singapore was one of the first to make a big investment in digital twin technology (off-chain) but Dubai is making the most waves in terms of embracing the metaverse as a formal part of the city’s strategy to become the global mecca for the metaverse, generating $4 billion for the local economy and creating more than 40,000 jobs by 2030.  One of the main drivers for smart cities embracing the metaverse is to engage in hyper-realistic planning of new public and private infrastructure projects. By creating a digital twin of an entire city in 3D, planners are able to evaluate the implications of a new highway, a new train line and new commercial real estate projects on traffic, on quality of life and carbon emissions, too.  Furthermore, cities embracing these metaverse projects can more transparently share the potential impacts of future infrastructure with citizens by inviting them into the metaverse environment and to get citizens opinions or even enhance the model by viewing how citizens anticipate engaging with the resulting infrastructure.  The market for digital twins including for cities themselves has been estimated to be worth $86 billion by 2028. As such you can bet we will see many existing and new metaverse companies go after this market to help policy makers modernize infrastructure investment decision-making.  Conclusion  ReFi is going mainstream and policy and regulation could very well serve as an accelerant to the ReFi boom I predicted for 2023. Beyond 2023 as well, the market opportunities for low-carbon blockchains, for solving coordination problems with respect to public-goods funding, for bringing transparency to carbon markets and for embracing ReFi apps and the metaverse are likely to grow exponentially. Maybe policy is not bad after all.

The Doodles team has been teasing the latest NFT project since last year, releasing a colorful animated video that hinted at a “mass market, identity-focused” offshoot of its original project.  The company previously said that the new project will allow anyone to mint a “base-level Doodle'' and “choose generic traits like skin tone and hair color.” Doodles 2 can then be customized with wearables featuring “varying tiers of rarity.” The NFTs will be “dynamic” and the images will be available as “full body or PFP.”  The team also released mysterious Dooplicator NFTs linked to the Doodles 2 experience in May. The devices were free to mint for every Doodle holder.  On Tuesday, the company released a short video showing different Doodles characters with customizable outfits, music and accessories. The first step of the Doodles 2 experience will open to existing Doodles holders on Jan. 31.  ""Wearable collections will be released via limited-edition IRL drops tied to specific events and brand collaborations with notable partners and public figures,"" the Doodles team wrote in a press release. Wearables can then be traded on Flow's Gaia marketplace.  The Doodles team said it chose the Dapper Labs-backed Flow blockchain because of its ""frictionless onboarding and world-class security, safety and recoverability,"" which will help them onboard new users.  “We’ve productized the community’s desire to customize their Doodles so that it matches their IRL vibe exactly,"" said Doodles head of product and co-founder Jordan Castro. ""Tech aside, Doodles 2 is the passport that’s used in all of our products – experiences, games, apps, music, animation releases, to bring further personalization, customization and rewards to our fans.”  The core Doodles collections will remain on Ethereum.  ""As we grow our brand across other verticals like animation and music, Flow’s accessible and seamless onboarding experience enables us to capture audiences that are introduced through traditional media channels,"" said CEO Julian Holguin. ""We believe the combination of Ethereum and Flow is the ideal format to support and invest in our core Web3 community, while opening the gates to welcome new collectors.""  Doodles launched as a 10,000-edition colorful PFP (profile picture) project in October 2021. Since then, the project has released a free companion NFT collection for existing holders called Space Doodles and has laid out its goals for expansion, including music, events and attractions, gaming, animation, IP partnerships and consumer products.

42435145,te14p4VjvrIefREtKdot1C,1674659181,How a Crypto Quant Firm Shook Off the Bear Market – and FTX Exposure,"Crypto quantitative trading firm Pythagoras Investment Management LLC made it through the turmoil of 2022 in a rare position. The firm’s funds were up 8% for the year even with exposure to the implosion of crypto exchange FTX. However, the market turbulence halved the company's assets under management to less than $40 million as wary investors stepped to the sidelines.  In a chat with CoinDesk, Pythagoras founder and CEO Mitchell Dong discussed the firm’s market-topping strategies, how risk mitigation has changed post-FTX, and why there’s still hope for the future of crypto.  Market neutral fund strategy  The market neutral Pythagoras Arbitrage Fund was up a slight 0.1% in December but ended the year with a net gain of 8.8%, according to an investor letter shared with CoinDesk.  “We just look for spreads,” said Dong, who has more than 25 years experience operating hedge funds. “We look for opportunities to buy low and sell high simultaneously whenever the software detects an opportunity to do so.”  The trend-following Momentum Fund declined 0.4% in December but still ended the year with a net gain of 8.1% The fund takes both long and short positions based on what technical indicators show.  FTX exposure  The principal threat to Pythagoras’ Arbitrage Fund is counterparty risk. In order to make instant trades, the firm has to keep money on exchanges. Pythagoras diversifies its assets across at least a dozen exchanges with no more than 10% of its funds with any one brokerage, Dong said. Prior to the FTX collapse, Pythagoras did have 10% of its assets with that exchange.  Dong and team immediately requested a full withdrawal from FTX, but only 7% was recovered before the exchange suspended withdrawals. The remaining 3% loss was hedged or offset, first by shorting FTT tokens – the native token of the FTX exchange – and then by taking advantage of a temporary discount in bitcoin and ether futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) that were 3% to 5%, respectively, lower than comparable prices on Binance.  Pythagoras has since tightened up its exposure to exchanges, now favoring those found to have the best technology and credit rating and lowest counterparty risks.  Current crypto climate  Dong has spoken to the firm’s largest investors who requested redemptions and who had wanted to step aside until the dust settles. These investors have a long history with Pythagoras and indicated plans to return to the crypto fold in the future.  “The bad news is that we had redemptions,” said Dong. “The good news is that there’s less competition, more price dislocations and trading opportunities. Previous trades which had been [arbitraged] out are back again.”  Read more: VC Firm Pantera's 2023 Crypto Forecast Says the Future Is DeFi",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/01/25/how-a-crypto-quant-firm-shook-off-the-bear-market-and-ftx-exposure,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d9648eeb7f2a4f112b387b4abcc75cd174bfac95-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Justin Sun🌞🇬🇩🇩🇲🔥₮ (@justinsuntron) January 23, 2023 The contrasting factor lies mainly in TRX unique architecture, as it is dispersed into three categories or layers: the Storage Layer which has a distributed block storage the Application Layer which is mobilized by developers for creating dApps that are used for issuing tokens the Core Layer which consists of varied modules and smart contracts These different layers are interconnected using a protocol that is compatible with multiple programming languages. More so, the network also has built its community which is fostered towards the goal of speeding up the internet’s decentralizations with the use of blockchain and dApps. On December 27, the TRX community merged with the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) bandwagon, which is geared towards promoting best practices with the use of Ethereum blockchain technology, enabling real-world applications and processes. TRON As Legal Tender; Social Volume Up With St. Maarten’s announcement declaring the adoption of TRON as legal tender, its native token responded accordingly with metrics looking positive.

42411252,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMVj9,1674657142,Congress and Crypto Season 4: An Uphill Battle,"“Why isn’t this a TV show already?!”  This is a common question on Capitol Hill when it comes to crypto policy. Considering the zany characters (in politics and crypto), bombastic lines of questioning at congressional hearings, gaffes which turn into meme tokens and constant media frenzy – crypto is a policy realm unlike any other. The topics are complex, the news cycle is relentless, and the challenges to solve are daunting, which is why crypto policy is not for the faint of heart.  The stakes for the industry couldn’t be higher, and “Congress and Crypto: Season 4” is shaping up as the most consequential yet. In describing this show, it’s helpful to break down the previous seasons.  Ron Hammond is director of government relations for the Blockchain Association. This article is part of CoinDesk’s “Policy Week.”  Season 1 (2016-2018) takes place in WeWork offices and stars lobbyists at CoinCenter and the Blockchain Association. For a relatively new industry, these two organizations have been around the longest. The handful of tech and privacy-focused policy wonks spend their days strategizing how to break down the complex topic of cryptocurrency to members of Congress who are double their age and the Capitol Hill staffers who are half it.  Season 2 (2019-2021) takes place on the heels of the announcement of Facebook’s Libra project and ends with the infamous “infrastructure fight” episode. During the climax, the industry rallies together to attempt to defeat a crypto tax provision tucked into President Joe Biden’s hallmark legislation, the bipartisan infrastructure bill. The cast of characters grows into an ensemble, and each crypto faction splinters the ecosystem further.  See also: Diem: A Dream Deferred? / Opinion  Season 3 (2022) brings a new set of major players, and none is more important than Sam Bankman-Fried – a personality so large that he’s known only by his initials, SBF. He paints himself as the savior of the crypto industry and aggressively positions himself in front of Congress and regulators in every corner of Washington, D.C. In the end, however, SBF turns out not to be crypto’s white knight but the season’s villain. The collapse of his FTX crypto exchange and ensuing contagion wipes out several companies, and leaves one-third of all U.S. policymakers frustrated and embarrassed for having taken donations from an alleged fraudster.  See also: After FTX: How Congress Is Gearing Up to Regulate Crypto  Season 4 (2023) is shaping up to be the most memorable yet, with drama in both the speaker’s race and crypto policy. The industry is at its lowest point in the show’s history as the damage done by FTX’s collapse continues to reverberate. Relationships are tarnished, skeptics are more emboldened than ever and, in some cases, crypto is seen as politically toxic. Divided control of Congress provides opportunities for the industry, but it will take dedicated negotiations, education and political power to move anything. Fortunately, these are familiar challenges for the industry; every step in crypto policy is a brutal, bruising slog, but that is also what makes the back and forth so fun to watch.  As the lights go up, in one corner stands Rep. Patrick McHenry (R–N.C.), now chair of the House Financial Services Committee. He has expressed interest in market structure legislation and parameters around stablecoin issuers. Dealing with those two issues may garner a hefty amount of support from both sides of the aisle. In the other corner stands Sen. Sherrord Brown (D–Ohio), McHenry’s crypto polar opposite. While it’s difficult to see either protagonist finding common ground on sound crypto policy, many of the promising bills introduced in the 117th Congress were bipartisan. Perhaps this season will bring that theme forward and this odd couple will find joy in collaboration. Season 4 will also see the departure of many characters in Washington. Cabinet secretaries will depart, companies will shed their lobbyists, organizations will falter in the bear market and policymakers will pivot to other more pressing concerns as the year progresses. Regardless of those comings and goings, crypto is here for good. While the craziness of the day-to-day news is what makes this sector attractive, crypto has also proven to be resilient as an industry, and its main characters relentless.  This season will include new characters including former Treasury employee Rep. French Hill (R–Ark.) and Rhodes scholar Rep. Jim Himes (D–Conn.). These members, and several others, are seen as some of the sharpest minds in Congress, their backgrounds in traditional finance. While they approached crypto in seasons 1 and 2 with pronounced skepticism, they have gravitated toward issues that blend the two realms, such as stablecoin regulation. Perhaps most importantly, they have the ears and respect of their conference and can assist colleagues like McHenry and Brown to move legislation across the finish line.  See also: SEC Is ‘Asleep at the Wheel,’ Rep. Davidson of Ohio Says  Season 4 may be the most compelling and substantive season yet. As season 3 taught us, don’t come to Washington for attention or to make it about yourself. The crypto industry is more than one man or personality – it’s an ecosystem of individuals who fought through the noise and are now working and communicating together.  We talk openly about policy proposals with our communities on Twitter, engage in debates on Discord and advocate for our digital rights in the metaverse.

42411249,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMVVv,1674656486,How Self-Regulation Can Help Crypto Thrive,"The implementation of self-regulation is necessary in order for any industry to be healthy, irrespective of the decisions and laws of outsider rulemakers. Self-regulation can be described as the founding of institutions to safeguard trust and quality in an industry by monitoring, promoting and enforcing standards of conduct. This is not a new idea – for centuries, working communities have machined standards and guidelines for groups and organizations to abide by.  Medieval guilds provide a good case study. Guilds were organizations of craftsmen working in a particular industry. They set up the apprentice-journeyman-master pipeline for enterprising newcomers and they vetted admission to each tier. They also mediated disputes between practitioners, established quality standards and did a host of other things that helped create and protect trust in their industry. Many of these things were implicit, unspoken and passed down as tradition without written law from far-away bureaucrats.  Miguel Morel is founder and CEO of Arkham Intelligence, a blockchain analytics company. This piece is part of CoinDesk's ""Policy Week.""  There is always the risk that self-regulating institutions, like any other, can decay and become rent-seeking rather than prosocial guardians. By the 1600s, medieval guilds had become entrenched monopolies that resisted technological innovation and prevented talented newcomers from displacing the old guard. If that sounds familiar, the same is true today of our modern financial system’s regulatory bodies.  Nevertheless, there being a risk of such corruption is not a good reason to abandon self-regulation entirely. The alternative – varying levels of industrial anarchy and “Wild West” practices – is even worse, as the crypto crisis of the past year violently illustrated. Avoiding these failure modes and successfully implementing self-regulation in the blockchain ecosystem first requires the involvement and leadership of people of high competence and integrity.  Read more: Most Influential 2022 - The ‘Good Cop and Bad Cop’ of US Crypto Regulations  Fortunately, the technological fundamentals of blockchain technology such as decentralization, auditability and the visibility of on-chain data provide a toolbox for making self-regulation easier.  If a project commits to a set lockup schedule, this can be easily verified on-chain by anyone. The role of the self-regulating institutions, then, is to monitor and interpret this data, as it is often difficult to understand and the details can sometimes be subject to debate. Additionally, the public nature of blockchains prevents gatekeeping and allows members of the ecosystem to verify the work of these institutions, helping to stave off corruption.  Efforts towards crypto self-regulation have already begun to blossom from the ashes of 2022. There is much greater interest in verifying the claims of exchanges and projects with on-chain data. There is a need for trusted institutions, such as companies working in blockchain analytics or market surveillance more broadly, to step in and provide oversight and verification, as the controversy and ambiguity over exchange proof-of-reserves projects has shown.  Over the next year, my expectation is that these institutions will develop naturally as users learn where to place their trust, mitigating the need for external regulation, and allowing the industry to better meet the challenges it faces.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | ARKM,Miguel Morel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/01/25/crypto-self-regulation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9b09e3eb99957467bc186569cfa90d1af3882d94-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411255,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMVpl,1674656086,Sweeping Crypto Regulation? First Update the Bank Secrecy Act,"The crypto collapses of 2022 spurred widespread fear that U.S. officials would soon clamp down on the industry, but don’t expect sweeping new crypto regulations anytime soon. As much as Washington, D.C., bigwigs might want to put crypto in a box, regulators should first get their priorities in order.  The primary regulatory approach of relevant federal agencies is rulemaking, or the process by which bodies like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) craft, review and finally approve and establish legal boundaries. But this would likely fail with crypto for two reasons.  This article is part of CoinDesk's ""Policy Week."" Mark Lurie is the CEO of Shipyard Software.  First, the legally mandated process – which involves drafting the rule, publishing the rule and taking public comments before a judicial review – takes years. Given how quickly crypto moves, there’s a good chance that by the time a new set of rules goes into effect the industry will have evolved beyond it or adapted their products to avoid it.  Second, regulators must work within the framework of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). This law lays out a comprehensive framework for AML/CFT – shorthand for anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism rules – built on the foundation of “know your customer,” aka KYC.  But stringent KYC within decentralized finance (DeFi) is not only unnecessary, it’s all but impossible.  DeFi platforms do not actually hold user funds, so it’s not clear how KYC is even relevant. Sure, these protocols oversee and approve users’ financial transactions, but DeFi’s non-custodial nature makes it all but impossible to implement effective and responsible KYC policies. For instance, if the SEC were to shut down Uniswap, a popular decentralized exchange, 1,000 developers around the world would simply deploy forks without batting an eye.  See also: How FinCEN Became a Honeypot for Sensitive Personal Data  Regulators would soon end up playing whack-a-mole with DeFi – a quixotic exercise that would echo efforts to end file-sharing by suing college students for downloading music. The likeliest outcome would be regulators with egg on their face.  Another option is regulation by enforcement, with laws that are so broadly written they could apply to just about any transaction but in the end are rather selectively enforced. Strategic ambiguity is itself the deterrent. This route is likely to further disorient and frustrate many honest crypto actors, but it appears to be the only practical path for regulators to walk.  Instead of updating existing legislation, Congress should unravel the BSA.  Role of regulation  Enacted after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the BSA is a compilation of several acts, including the Patriot Act. By outlining a comprehensive AML/CFT framework, the BSA essentially mandates all financial institutions to enact stringent KYC policies and monitor all transactions, including increasingly rigorous due diligence as transactions become larger and more suspicious.  If the risk is seen as significant, banks and financial bodies must submit a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) to the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), which reviews the reports to detect illicit activity.  Financial institutions filed more than 3 million SARs in 2022 alone. That’s a lot of SARs. Yet, BSA enforcement is delegated to a variety of agencies. The SEC enforces it for securities exchanges, for instance, while the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) enforces it for banks. FinCen enforces it for any actors not explicitly assigned to another federal regulator, such as money transmitters.  The foundational problem with the BSA is that when it was written large sums of money could only be transmitted through intermediaries. Further, transaction databases were siloed within each intermediary, making them easy to surveil. In this context the BSA is logical and effective.  But blockchain and DeFi have changed the game, enabling the legal exchange of vast sums of money with no intermediary. Such transactions are also permissionless, meaning they require no administrative oversight and are largely anonymous. This contradicts the basic assumptions of the BSA, rendering it largely impractical and unenforceable.  Yet, the BSA’s KYC framework is so ingrained within U.S. regulators’ compliance culture that it has become gospel. Speaking out against the received wisdom on KYC is blasphemous, akin to siding with crooks and grifters.  But in the real world, guilt until proven innocent has never been an effective means of regulation. KYC is not an end in itself but a means to an end. Preventing money laundering and terror financing need not require a broad brush stroke that kneecaps new business models and stunts innocuous user activity.  See also: Protecting Digital Privacy Rights: Congress Urged to Defend Human Rights  The reality is that crypto comes with its own regulatory tool: the blockchain. Rather than siloing transaction databases across multiple financial oversight bodies, the blockchain ledger provides a single consolidated database for all relevant transactions.  Know your transaction  Instead of KYC, regulators should shift to KYT, or Know Your Transaction. Given blockchain’s open-source nature, the noncustodial design of most DeFi platforms, and users’ ability to effortlessly spin up multiple addresses, the only way to effectively regulate the space is on the individual transaction level.  After all, it’s not the financial histories of individual users that should concern regulators but the origins of the funds. KYT would institute blockchain review mechanisms that would follow the money and prohibit unsanctioned transactions.  From the tech perspective, requiring platforms to check funds’ origins before transaction approval would be relatively straightforward with existing tools and technology. Whenever wallets and its funds are found to have been tainted by a bad actor, such as a sanctioned address or known hacker wallet, the protocol could simply reject the transaction.  This approach could be risk-based, allowing protocols to avoid banning innocent DeFi users for transactions they did not facilitate. Something along these lines happened after Tornado Cash was sanctioned by the U.S. government, when Aave's frontend website temporarily blocked victims of a dusting attack involving funds from the sanctioned anonymizing protocol.  See also: Stop Attacking DeFi Founders for Complying With the Tornado Cash Sanctions | Opinion  KYT could be even more effective than KYC, enabling authorities to monitor the entire transaction database, not just the red-flagged transactions within submitted SARs.  The BSA is considered untouchable, but when the law was first drafted back in 1970, its creators could never have imagined today’s financial reality. It’s time to haul this outdated regulatory mechanism into the 21st century and effectively mitigate money laundering while ensuring the continued maturation of crypto.  CORRECTION (JAN. 25, 2023 – 20:45 UTC): Aave's frontend website accidentally blocked victims of a Tornado Cash ""dusting attack"" due to a misconfiguration from data provided by TRM Labs.

The network will introduce stablecoins, Hydra and more Oracles in 2023. Though I expect a lower low, this is a good place to add if you still don't own any ADA. This article was originally published on my Marketplace, Technically Crypto, on January 9, 2023 Thesis Summary Solana ( SOL-USD ) was one of the worst-performing coins in 2022, and this fate won't change in 2023. Following Solana's sell-off, other L1 tokens have come under scrutiny, and Cardano ( ADA-USD ) is one of them. Solana and Cardano share many similarities as possible ""Ethereum killers"" but also have distinct differences that make them very different. Cardano has some characteristics that make it a much more robust and superior blockchain than Solana, which is why I am still long Cardano. Cardano Is Not Solana First, let's quickly address why Solana's price has suffered so much recently, before this significant rally. The Solana blockchain had strong ties to FTX and Alameda. Firstly, SOL was one of Alameda's core holdings . More importantly, though, and the reason for this, is that FTX and Alameda were the driving force behind Serum . Serum was a decentralized exchange that was the main liquidity provider behind the DeFi ecosystem of the Solana blockchain. When Alameda and FTX collapsed, so did Serum, and DeFi activity on Solana collapsed. Solana's collapse could partly be attributed to over-centralization or at the very least, over-dependence on a few key actors. But this is not the case with Cardano. Token Distribution Solana was born from the mind of Anatoly Yakovenko and has always been very heavily supported by VCs and investors. This is clear when we look at the initial token distribution. Solana Token Distribution (Messari) If we add up the tokens that were given to Founders and Premined Rewards and Airdrops, 63% of the token supply could be said to be in the hands of ""insiders"". This is very different when we look at Cardano: Cardano Token Distribution (Messari) In Cardano's case, only 16.67% of the token supply is held by insiders, both over 80% available to the general public. This means the Cardano network is a lot more robust, and this is also supported by number of validators, of which there are 2924 on Cardano , versus 1900 on Solana Programming Language Another key difference between Solana and Cardano is their programming language. Since both are ultimately designed to enable smart contracts, this is very important. Solana uses some more typical programming languages like C++ and Rust. On the other hand, Cardano uses Haskell as the basis for its own programming language, Plutus. The reason is that Haskell, particularly in conjunction with formal methods, is well-suited to write robust and correct code. But to understand why this is important for Cardano, we first need to explore what Haskell is and examine its role as a functional programming language. Source: medium.com In other words, Haskell favours ""pure"" functions, which always give the same results regardless of the inputs. As we can see, the number of Plutus contracts has been increasing quickly, showing that developer activity is high in the Cardano blockchain. Plutus scripts (Cardano Blockchain Insights) This is a key reason why Cardano, in my opinion, is superior to Solana. Cardano was designed very thoughtfully, which is also evident when we look at the very clear roadmap that the foundation has laid in front of us. What's Next For Cardano In 2023? Cardano has three major updates coming up in 2023. First, at least two new stablecoins will be launched on Cardano. The foundation behind Cardano will be launching USDA on the Anses platform. There is also the DJED stablecoin being developed in partnership with Coti . This is being advertised as an overcollateralized stablecoin. Another big update that will come to Cardano is Hydra, the network's layer 2 scaling solution. Like other scaling solutions, Hydra will allow transactions to be processed off-chain, which will take pressure off the main chain. Lastly, Cardano will also be launching more Oracles , which connect the blockchain with real-world data. Currently, Cardano has Charli3 . The Cardano Chart On the long-term chart, we have almost tagged the 50% fib retracement of our wave 1 in blue. However, my main expectation remains that wave 5 could extend into the 12-cent region, where we have a 61.8% retracement. Also, this is where the 1,618 ext of wave A lands us too. I'll have to reconsider if we can break above resistance at 59 cents, which is the wave 2 high. Cardano LT chart (Author's work) ADA short term chart (Author's work) Zooming into the short-term chart, we have completed five waves up in what I see as an A wave. This looks very impulsive, and it's not crazy to think we could rally into the 50-cent region. This is possible since we are dealing with a diagonal, so wave 4 can overlap wave 1 but not surpass the top of 2, which is why we have such a key resistance there. Final Thoughts Cardano continues to be one of my favourite L1 coins, and I have clearly stated why in this article. Though I expect we could see one more low, if you haven't got any Cardano yet, these are still good levels to start buying and Dollar-cost-averaging.",POSITIVE,ADA | SOL,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | ICO | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4572208-cardano-is-not-solana-in-a-very-good-way?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/8124186.jpeg

The fund will back projects that accelerate the adoption of interoperable infrastructure and decentralized finance (DeFi).  The initiative will offer token and equity investments and give operational support through memberships in development, cryptographic research, marketing and community growth. Injective, based in New York, is also kicking off a global virtual hackathon where developers will be able to submit projects for potential venture funding.  The collapse of multibillion-dollar centralized crypto exchange FTX in November tightened the wallets of investors, though a number of deals were already in progress. Injective was able to assemble the ecosystem initiative in a couple of months, co-founder and CEO Eric Chen told CoinDesk in an interview.  “It certainly accelerated because of the recent failures of centralized players,” said Chen. “But it wasn’t difficult at all, for us at least, because a lot of the backers have formally or informally participated in the ecosystem, supporting projects.”  Injective-based apps cover a range of financial verticals, including exchanges, options, derivatives and lending. The initiative will support projects that focus on interoperability, DeFi, trading, proof-of-stake (PoS) infrastructure and scalability solutions. Other backers include Gate Labs, Flow Traders, IDG Capital and Kraken Ventures.  Injective's decentralized smart contract platform was created using Cosmos' software development kit (SDK) and provides developers with modules to speed up the development of complex protocols. Injective protocols have interoperability through the native access to chains enabled with Cosmos IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) and Ethereum.  The ecosystem is powered by the INJ token, which has a market cap of about $144.6 million, according to CoinDesk data. In August, Injective raised $40 million in a funding round backed by Jump Crypto and hedge fund Brevan Howard to boost INJ’s utility in providing liquidity to projects in the ecosystem.  The price of INJ was down with the rest of the crypto market ahead of the news, but has since rallied to be up more than 20% for the 24-hour period to $2.36.

42414568,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBBB1a,1674655217,Web3 Developer Platform Alchemy Releases Transaction Simulation Product,"Alchemy, a Web3 developer platform firm, released a new “Transaction Simulation” product designed to make initiating and sending crypto transactions more user-friendly.  Users are often susceptible to scams because of a lack of understanding about where they are sending transactions. Chainalysis, a blockchain analysis firm, recently released a report that blockchain users in 2022 lost nearly $5 billion to scams. Alchemy says its simulation kit aims to build a sort of safety mechanism that lets users ensure their transaction data is correct and that the transaction is going to the right place.  Developers will have “the tools to incorporate simulation in their products,” Bastien Moyroud, a product engineer at Alchemy, told CoinDesk. Moyroud added that the goal is “to empower users to have more visibility in terms of what's happening.”  The new product features three new APIs: “Asset Changes,” “Execution Simulation” and “Bundle Simulation.” They’re available on the Ethereum, Polygon and Arbitrum blockchains. (The first two APIs are available already, and the third will go live next week.)  How does it work?  With the first API, the simulator is able to tell with a transaction what is going in and out of the user's wallet, offering an extra sense of security.  The second API gives developers a readout on certain data based on the execution simulation.  The third API allows developers to bundle transactions and allow them to execute them sequentially (so one transaction will move automatically after the other).

The goal is to incentivize more 1INCH stakers to delegate their Unicorn Power to resolvers. Incentivize 1inch Stakers’ Delegation To Resolvers 1inch Network wants to increase the number of resolvers within its platform. Accordingly, it launched the 1inch Resolver Incentive Program in December 2022. The program’s goal was to compensate resolvers for the cost of gas they pay when they fill in user orders. As part of this arrangement, the aggregator encourages its users to stake 1INCH, their native governance token. Any user who stakes the governance token receives Unicorn Power in place of delegation rewards. Related Reading: MEV Crypto Bot Gains $1M But Loses Same To Hack Same Day Unicorn Power can either be delegated to resolvers or be used when voting on crucial network decisions. The aggregator has stated that the number of Unicorn Power received directly depends on the lockup period. Stakers who lock their assets for longer will receive more Unicorn Power. Following this announcement, 1inch Network will now distribute 250,000 1INCH to resolvers weekly. The program will run until all 10 million 1INCH are distributed. Funds from the foundation will, in turn, be used to reward 1INCH stakers who choose to delegate their Unicorn Power. However, the 1inch Foundation has stated that the number of 1INCH received will vary between resolvers depending on their network share. Program Follows Launch Of Fusion In late December 2022, 1inch Network launched the Fusion Mode. With Fusion, users can swap transactions without paying network fees. Depending on the underlying platform, network fees can vary from near-zero, cents, to double digits, in USD terms, in some blockchains, mainly Ethereum. Gas fees tend to spike when the Ethereum network is congested. Subsequently, this can increase the cost of swapping transactions in top decentralized exchanges like Uniswap, a platform whose price feeds are aggregated by the 1inch Network. Related Reading: 1Inch Exchange Co-Founder Disputes Claims bZx Attackers Stole $8m in DeFi Exploit In Fusion Mode, resolvers play a critical role in enabling users to swap without paying transaction fees. In this setup, resolvers fill pending orders. These resolvers are professional market makers who will pay underlying gas fees on behalf of the user. As a result of their participation, they profit from arbitrage trading. The launch of Fusion was described as a huge step forward for the entire DeFi space by Sergej Kunz, the co-founder of 1Inch Network. He added that swapping on the platform using Fusion will be much more cost-efficient and safer. “This is a huge step forward for the entire DeFi space. Fusion makes swaps on 1inch dramatically more cost-efficient, as users won’t have to pay network fees, plus, an extra layer of security is added, protecting users from sandwich attacks.” 1INCH is trading at $0.514 as of writing on January 25.

Ether and dogecoin (DOGE) led the declines among major tokens, as each token fell more than 5%, Cardano's ADA and Polygon's MATIC both dropped 4%, while bitcoin lost 1.6%, CoinDesk data shows. The drops caused upward of $173 million in longs, or bets on higher token prices, to be liquidated. Ether futures saw $86 million in liquidations, while traders of bitcoin futures lost $46 million, according to data source Coinglass.  Binance mistakenly kept collateral for some of the crypto assets it issues in the same wallet as funds belonging to its customers, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. The exchange issued 94 so-called Binance-peg tokens (B-Tokens), and reserves for almost half of those are stored in a cold wallet called Binance 8. The wallet contains more tokens than required for the number of B-Tokens issued. The issue is, when collateral is pooled together and used for trading, it’s locked up, and clients or holders of assets may not be able to withdraw if the pool is reduced, Laurent Kssis, a crypto trading adviser at CEC Capital, said in a note to CoinDesk. “In essence this means that there is no segregation of assets between clients' funds and any collateral used,” Kssis said. “This could lead to the owner(s) not being able to withdraw due to lack of funds or liquidity by the exchange.

The arguments will take place on March 7, which is sooner than Grayscale had expected. In a tweet on Tuesday, Grayscale said that “we previously anticipated oral arguments to be as soon as Q2 2023, so having them scheduled to begin on March 7 is welcome news.” Grayscale is a sister company of CoinDesk.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows ether's daily price action and shifts in the 50-day and 10-day simple moving averages of the cryptocurrency's price since November.

Canto, which runs on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), a term for virtual computers that power the Ethereum network, is a cheap and fast network that allows developers to build financial products, such as those for lending and borrowing, atop the blockchain.  Applications running on Canto locked over $120 million worth of value as of Wednesday. The Canto DEX accounts for over 9% of that ecosystem. It uses smart contracts to match traders and rewards liquidity providers with tokens.  The price of Canto's token jumped 30% in the past 24 hours, CoinGecko data shows, bucking a market-wide slide.  The DEX processed over $63 million in trades in the past 24 hours, compared with Monday’s figures of $21 million, setting a new record high. The DEX has seen over $330 million in trading volume this month.  A draw for traders is Canto DEX’s mechanisms to prevent “rent-seeking behaviors” – or tactics where predatory developers build products that extract value without benefiting the overall Canto ecosystem – as defined in its technical documents.  The protocol cannot be upgraded, has no official interface and runs in perpetuity without the “ability to implement fees,” the documents read.  Trading volume surged as some developers floated a proposal to launch Canto’s ""contract secured revenue,"" or CSR, on the main network.  According to the proposal, CSR is a fee-splitting model for the Canto network that enables smart-contract developers to earn money from their original work by claiming a percentage of the transaction fees paid to the network when users interact with their smart contracts.  Those fees are distributed in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to developers, who could trade, stake or post the NFTs as collateral for loans.  Such a method helps incentivize developers to build products that attract users, which in turn leads to higher revenue and usage of the Canto network, benefiting the CANTO token and the related network.  CSR is being tested on a private test network, or a blockchain that mimics real-world usage.  The CANTO token was recently trading at 31 cents, according to CoinGecko.

8113705,https://newsbtc.com/?p=517437,1674649825,Here’s Why The Bitcoin Price Rally Stalled For Now,"The Bitcoin price rally has stalled for five days now. After BTC experienced a furious surge from $21,000 to $23,000 last Friday, the price is now in a consolidation phase. The reasons for this are diverse. As NewsBTC reported, Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) on a daily basis is showing severe overheating. The technical indicator reveals that the BTC price is in heavily oversold conditions. During the recent upward movement, the daily RSI was near 90 at times but has since cooled to 78 at press time. The stalling of the BTC price at $23,000 could therefore signal a healthy consolidation and a reset before a new price rally could be on the cards. Another key factor for the Bitcoin price in recent weeks has been its correlation with the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) and the S&P 500. Generally speaking, a weakening dollar is bullish for risk assets like Bitcoin and the S&P 500. However, the weekly chart of the DXY reveals that the dollar index is still holding above its weekly support at 101, which experts consider an extremely crucial support level. If the DXY breaks below this mark, things would be extremely bullish for the Bitcoin price. However, due to the still-standing support, the euphoria among risk investors may have also come to a halt for the moment. FOMC Meeting Will Be Decisive For Bitcoin Price The next FOMC meeting of the U.S. central bank will take place in just one week, on February 1, and will probably set the course for another bull or bear trend. According to the CME FedWatch tool, 98.2% currently assume that the Fed will further reduce its rate hike pace and raise only 25 basis points. But statements from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will also be crucial. Related Reading: Overbought Or Ready To Rip? Bitcoin Daily RSI Reaches Explosive Levels Thomas Lee of Fundstrat Global Advisors assesses that inflation has “literally hit the wall” since October and that core inflation is not “sticky,” contrary to the Fed’s initial expectations. According to Lee, the bearish sentiment in the stock market in December was triggered by an “unforced error” by the Fed and led to the FOMC saying inflation was hotter in December. As a result, Fundstrat expects the FOMC to make a “course correction” in February, meaning financial conditions will loosen and the VIX will fall, which in turn will drive risk assets higher. However, Lance Roberts, chief strategist at RIA Advisors, warns that the Fed doesn’t like the current rally in financial markets and will therefore take appropriate action. The Fed really isn’t going to like the bulls running markets up and easing financial conditions this much. Don’t be surprised if Powell smacks the market again at the upcoming FOMC meeting. On the other hand, Fed Governor Chris Waller recently came out in favor of a 25 basis point rate hike at the next FOMC meeting, thus solidifying expectations for the February FOMC meeting, as reported by Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal aka the “Fed’s mouthpiece.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Just Saw Technical Correction But Key Uptrend Support Intact As the chief economics correspondent wrote via Twitter, Waller made it clear that the Fed would not make a risk management mistake similar to the one it made in 2021 when it stuck to its forecast for persistent disinflation. Waller said, “this is different from 2021 because it’s easier for the Fed to cut if it’s wrong.” “In other words, Waller sees the risk of having overtightened because inflation comes down quickly as a first-class problem,” Timiraos said. For Bitcoin’s price, the indication of an upcoming pivot and a 25 basis point hike would be a powerful reason for a new rally. At press time, the BTC price stood at $22,622.

42411246,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMVM0,1674649800,The Money in Ethereum's Middleware: Can Flashbots Still Call Itself a 'Public Good'?,"Ethereum research and development firm Flashbots pitched its MEV-Boost middleware as a “public good,” and the software is now used by a majority of the validators that run the network. But recently revealed fundraising plans have opened Flashbots to criticism that it may have exploited community goodwill in order to make a profit.  “Middleware” services are built on top of (rather than into) Ethereum’s core protocol, offering essential tools for app builders and the validators that run the network. Although validators and developers aren’t required to use any middleware programs, some, like Flashbots’ MEV-Boost, have become so ubiquitous that they may as well be built into the core protocol.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Hasu, who leads strategy at Flashbots, has at times referred to its MEV-Boost middleware as a “public good,” a term used to designate infrastructure that is built to benefit the wider community. But earlier this month, The Block reported that Flashbots is looking to raise $50 million at a $1 billion valuation. The round is being led by Paradigm, a venture firm where Hasu works as a researcher.  Flashbots’ high valuation isn’t all that surprising: More than 90% of the blocks that are written to Ethereum’s network are pre-assembled by MEV-Boost’s marketplace of third-party “builders.” Validators source blocks from MEV-Boost – rather than build blocks themselves – because MEV-Boost kicks back extra profit called maximal extractable value (MEV).  Read more: What Is MEV, aka Maximal Extractable Value?  “MEV is more or less a tax from unsophisticated traders to sophisticated ones, whereby users with high levels of technical know-how extract value from users who are less informed,” Darius Tabatabai, CEO at Vertex Protocol, explained in an email to CoinDesk.  Flashbots was supposed to reduce the negative impact of MEV by making it accessible to virtually any validator, and it has largely succeeded in its goal. But Flashbots has also introduced problems as a result of its massive growth.  Some people believe Flashbots’ approach to solving MEV has only worsened the problem, turning MEV into a multibillion-dollar cottage industry when it should instead be engineered out of existence. Others say that Flashbots’ dominant market position has helped to facilitate increased censorship on the network, centralizing Ethereum’s block-production apparatus and making it easier for governments to stop certain types of transactions.  Though it has faced criticism throughout its existence, Flashbots owes much of its growth to its community-centric marketing. It is unclear whether MEV-Boost would have been adopted so readily by the Ethereum community if it had pitched itself as a normal startup from the beginning.  Flashbots has been mindful of community criticism. ""Even Flashbots knows it has a lot of responsibility in their hands and has recognized that it needs to move further into the Ethereum-native system and distribute that authority more evenly,"" Or Dadosh, CEO of the crypto security service Ironblocks, told CoinDesk.  But with its reported fundraising efforts, the Flashbots-as-a-public-good pitch is beginning to feel disingenuous.  “While they set out to ‘mitigate’ [harmful MEV strategies] by recycling value to validators, etc., I just don’t think it addresses the core issue – that raising money for such an activity feels kind of questionable by relation,” explained Tabatabai.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/01/25/the-money-in-ethereums-middleware-can-flashbots-still-call-itself-a-public-good,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1f98d9cdf732697a868cc153af708eeb13808278-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Last April, Rishi Sunak – then finance minister and now prime minister – said he wanted to make the country a crypto hub, but a ""consultation,"" or a document that is put out for discussion, on how to govern the financial technology is now overdue.  “My undertaking is to have six roundtables with the sector with a variety of sector participants during 2023,” Griffith, a member of Sunak's Conservative Party, told lawmakers at Wednesday's parliamentary debate on regulating crypto.  “We'll bring forward timely, sensible and balanced regulation in order to allow the safe use of this technology,” while ensuring regulatory clarity and facilitating financial-technology investment, Griffith added.  Griffith declined to set a date for a policy document on crypto rules using new powers contained in the Financial Services and Markets Bill, previously promised before Christmas 2022. He said it would be “a matter of certainly weeks, not months,” and added that “sometimes that consultative process makes things a little longer than one might wish in a fast-moving domain.”  The U.K. crypto industry, which has been waiting for regulatory clarity, is keen to know the rules under which it will operate. Griffith acknowledged the importance of speed, as he sought to address concerns about slow registration processes by officials at the Financial Conduct Authority.  “I'm very interested, as we seek to have an agile proportionate financial regulatory system, that our regulators move at the right pace,” he said. “We can't have a financial system that's competitive internationally, if it has slow latency, if it doesn't operate at speed.”  Lisa Cameron, a lawmaker from the rival Scottish National Party who is chairwoman of a cross-party parliamentary crypto group, said she supported the government’s vision, but sought more clarity on the timing.  “I would really urge that the regulatory framework is taken forward at pace, because I think we need to protect consumers first and foremost,” Cameron said. “It's been almost a year since the government set out its landmark vision to make the U.K. a global hub for crypto investment.”  Read more: UK ‘Fully Behind’ Stablecoin for Wholesale Settlements, Treasury Official Says",POSITIVE,없음,MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/01/25/uk-minister-commits-to-greater-crypto-industry-engagement-as-new-regulation-looms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/15b3f372491099fe8cf4beebeff4e2bd2d14d7da-5124x3425.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

One, signed by Judge Martin Glenn of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, authorizes Celsius to return funds transferred to the platform after the company filed for bankruptcy on July 14, 2022, subject to certain conditions. Another authorizes a Flare token airdrop to eligible owners of XRP tokens that are locked on the platform.  The orders follow a Tuesday court hearing in which the lender's lawyers proposed a plan to return funds to creditors with locked assets above a certain threshold by issuing a token. Other customers, who the attorneys said make up the majority of creditors, would receive a one-time distribution in liquid crypto. The plan has yet to receive approval from the U.S. Trustee's Office or other regulators.  Celsius filed for bankruptcy in New York last July, a month after it froze customers' withdrawals under the weight of a sliding cryptocurrency market.  Read more: Celsius Proposes Restructuring to Offer One-Time ‘Meaningful Recovery’ Payout for Most Creditors  With the new court orders, customers are allowed to withdraw funds transferred to the platform after the bankruptcy petition date in the form of crypto ""net of any gas fees or transaction costs."" The withdrawals will need to be approved by the appointed committee of creditors should the transfer amount exceed $40,000 (and the transferor received more than of $200,000 from Celsius during the three months leading up to the bankruptcy filing).  Another order, also signed by Glenn, greenlighted a Flare token airdrop to eligible creditors. Flare, which initially aimed to be a decentralized-finance (DeFi) application that used XRP tokens, earlier this month distributed tokens to XRP holders after a two-year wait. Those who held at least one XRP at the time of a snapshot in December 2020 – which recorded the contents of a blockchain ledger at the time – qualified for the airdrop and should receive one token for each XRP held.

Mythical Games also acquired gaming asset platform DMarket to help build out the new product. The company will provide Mythical with the infrastructure for the Mythical Marketplace 2.0 that will allow users to purchase gameplay assets. The marketplace will incorporate DMarket’s anti-money laundering and fraud protection standards, as well as foster a community-oriented marketplace focused on digital ownership.  John Linden, CEO of Mythical Games, told CoinDesk the new marketplace will usher in a new digital ownership economy while onboarding new gamers into Web3.  “Our core audience really is introducing gamers into these mechanics,” said Linden. “You're just you're playing the game – you're buying items in the game and we're doing all the hard and heavy lifting behind the scenes,” said Linden.  Since Mythical’s Ethereum-compatible chain went live six weeks ago, it has processed over 2 million transactions. Still, the company continues to feel the effects of a prolonged crypto winter and market uncertainty.  In November, Mythical laid off 10% of its employees, citing rapid growth during the bull market and the need to restructure. Weeks later in December, the firm said they were planning to sue three former executives who left the company to start a new firm, Fenix Games, with capital they had intended to raise for Mythical.

8106033,https://newsbtc.com/?p=517434,1674646246,Celo Votes To Increase Minimum Gas Threshold,"Celo, a mobile-focused smart contracting platform compatible with Ethereum’s virtual machine, is voting on a proposal to increase the network’s minimum gas threshold. Voting for Celo Governance Proposal 0066 started today, Wednesday, January 18, and ends on Friday, January 27. As of the time of writing, the turnout stands at 2.6% of the total supply, with 6,840,826 CELO locked as votes. Out of this, 6,840,116 CELO supports the proposal, 620 CELO is against the idea, and 90 CELO are voting to abstain. CELO is the native currency of the Celo proof-of-stake smart contracting platform based on the PBFT consensus mechanism. The Celo Governance Proposal 0066 The proposal seeks to increase the minimum gas threshold to $0.001 for simple ERC-20 transactions. Unlike Ethereum, where gas fees must be paid in ETH only, in Celo, users can pay using ERC-20 currencies, not just CELO. Gas fees are paid to prevent Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. Related Reading: Celo Sees 20% Gains In Last Week As The Broader Crypto Market Retreats Like Ethereum, the gas fee structure in Celo adopts the proposals under EIP-1559. As EIP-1559 stipulates, there must be a gas price minimum that applies to all Celo transactions. This minimum fee applies regardless of the validator processing the transaction. It also fluctuates depending on demand. Celo has clarified that should the proposal pass, only the base fee will be impacted. Under the Celo Governance Proposal 0066, the validator rewards from the gas fee will not be affected. Celo added that though the base fee might increase slightly, network activity would remain the same because “gas prices are very low, transactions are virtually free.” Celo Will Benefit The proposer laid out the rationale of this proposal, saying that the cost of a transaction for the broader Celo ecosystem carries extra dimensions than the gas spent. Like in other chains, all transactions posted on the network must be processed and immutably stored in the blockchain. Related Reading: CELO Breaks Five-Day Losing Streak With a 30% Rebound; What’s Next The current gas structure, the proposer said, doesn’t impact processing or the general state of the network. However, it could have severe ramifications in the long term. Changing gas fees would have added benefits for the ecosystem, leading to a higher minimum benefit. Consequently, they argue that this will warrant the long-term cost of the overall ecosystem. Besides increasing the minimum benefits, the proposal will shield the network against spam attacks. By increasing the minimum gas fees threshold, any spamming activity would be more expensive. The proposal reads: “Stability and security of the network 1 Low gas prices allow actors to spam the network at virtually no cost. Currently, it would take time, until the minimum gas threshold increases substantially, to stop the attack. Increasing the minimum gas threshold ensures that such an attack is much more costly from the get-go, even if it is only sustained for a short period.” CELO is trading at $0.682 when writing on January 25, 2023.

42414577,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBBBXQ,1674644431,Bitcoin's Upswing Is Reminiscent of 2019 Bull Revival,"Bitcoin (BTC) could be in position for a big move higher if history is any guide, with a recent upswing paralleling the bull revival of mid-2019 that saw the price surge by almost 250%.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value has jumped nearly 40% to $23,000 this month, according to CoinDesk data. The rally follows a yearlong swoon that knocked 68% off the price followed by prolonged consolidation at the depths of the bear market at around $18,000 and comes as the U.S. Federal Reserve nears the tail end of its liquidity-tightening cycle that roiled risky assets, including cryptocurrencies.  The conditions echo those that preceded bitcoin's bull revival in the second quarter of 2019. Then, the price surged 247% to $13,800 as the Fed's tightening cycle peaked.  ""During the four months prior to the 2019 rally, BTC traded in a tight range near the lows, as shorts pressed their advantage while strong hands accumulated,"" macro trader Geo Chen said in the Jan. 20 edition of his popular Fidenza Macro Substack-based newsletter, noting common features between 2019's price surge and 2023's. ""The 2019 rally coincided with a Goldilocks environment of slowing growth and inflation, which caused the Fed to take its foot off the tightening pedal.""  The Fed's previous tightening cycle lasted three years. It started in December 2015 and ended December 2018, and lifted the central bank's benchmark borrowing rate to the 2.25%-2.5% range.  Last year, the Fed raised the benchmark borrowing rate from 0% to 4.25%. The market now expects it to slow the pace of rate increases to 25 basis points in February and March and then pause its rate-hike cycle, with forward-looking indicators pointing to a marked slowdown in inflation and economic activity.  Bitcoin's market action since July looks eerily similar to the moves witnessed from late November 2018 to early April 2019.  The seller exhaustion seen last November and the subsequent turn higher are consistent with bitcoin's record of bottoming out 17 months ahead of the mining reward halving and rallying in the year leading up to the event. Bitcoin's fourth reward halving, a programmed code reducing the pace of supply expansion by 50% every four years, is due to occur in March or April.  All things considered, the path of least resistance for bitcoin appears to be on the higher side. Still, Chen prefers buying ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value over bitcoin.  ""I believe the potential of ETH to outperform BTC due to the Merge has not been fully realized due to the bear market,"" Chen noted. ""I also believe Web3 and DeFi (decentralized finance) will continue to be the greatest source of growth and innovation in the crypto ecosystem, and the majority of Web 3 and DeFi uses ETH as the base layer. BTC will remain the low-beta safe-haven currency relative to ETH.""  Chen has taken a long position in ETH/USD and expects ether to rally as high as $3,400 in the next three months.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/25/bitcoins-recent-upswing-is-reminiscent-of-the-bull-revival-of-2019,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bfac2e850a10c52efe3bde0e88de44233b26eca1-4032x3024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

8097783,https://newsbtc.com/?p=517414,1674642649,Number Of New Ethereum Validators Remains Flat Ahead Of Shanghai Upgrade,"There is no marked shift in the number of new addresses depositing the required 32 ETH, the minimum amount required to be deposited into the Beacon Chain for holders who wish to operate a validator node, into the official Beacon Chain Deposit Address ahead of the Shanghai Upgrade on Ethereum. The Shanghai Upgrade is scheduled for March 2023 and this hard fork will allow stakers to unlock ETH locked in the Beacon Chain. Number of New ETH Depositors Falling Apart from the spike in new deposits in the second quarter of 2021, the number of new accounts depositing 32 ETH is declining. The figure remains flat throughout the second half of 2021, the better part of 2022, and January 2023. Data from Cryptoquant shows that 49 new accounts deposited 32 ETH into the Beacon Chain on January 23, down from 210 recorded less than 10 days earlier on January 13. This is nothing compared to the 2,158 new depositors recorded on May 27, 2021. Related Reading: Number of New Ethereum Smart Contracts Falls 60% in 2023 Ethereum shifted from a proof of work system to a staking system in 2022 via the Merge. During the Merge, the proof-of-work algorithm was officially switched off as the network transited to a staking system, replacing miners with validators. Validators are required to stake at least 32 ETH. This amount is needed to ensure that they comply with the network’s rules. Validators are tasked with confirming on-chain transactions and securing the network. The stake amount is “slashed” whenever they try acting maliciously, or their performance drops, falling lower than the network stipulates. In extreme cases, other Ethereum validators can “slash” the offending validator, wiping out their entire stake. Proof-of-Stake In Ethereum Fosters Decentralization The growth in the number of unique accounts, mostly validators depositing over 32 ETH, has been linear since late 2020. To illustrate, the number of unique depositors rose from 77 on November 4, 2020, to 82,634 on January 24, 2023. This steady growth is a positive for Ethereum as a network. It could be an indicator of the positive response from the community. By eliminating miners for validators, the playing field is leveled for everyone, including those who couldn’t afford to buy mining gear or actively keep track of graphic card prices. Ethereum validators are required to ensure their nodes operate with high reliability and 100% up-time. This is in place of operating mining rigs which were energy intensive, scarce, and generally expensive. As of January 25, over $25.2 billion worth of ETH was officially locked in the official Beacon Chain Deposit Address. The dollar value, however, fluctuates depending on the ETH spot rates. After peaking in late November 2021, ETH prices have more than halved to spot rates at $1,556 on January 2023 at the time of writing. On June 18, 2022, ETH prices fell to a cycle low of $880.

42414569,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBBAwH,1674640873,Solana Liquid-Staking Tool Marinade Looks to Bolster Its Token Value With Staked SOL Capture,"The market leader for Solana-based liquid-staking derivatives, Marinade.Finance is dangling its governance token MNDE as a carrot to kickstart a crypto economy for its iteration of staked SOL.  On Tuesday, Marinade said it will hand out 160 million MNDE tokens to protocols and validators in exchange for them depositing up to 40 million SOL tokens into Marinade’s liquid-staking product, which is Solana’s biggest decentralized-finance (DeFi) protocol with $144 million in total value locked, or TVL.  If all goes to plan, this “open door” could boost Marinade’s TVL sevenfold, Marinade developers told CoinDesk. They want to drive more users into Marinade’s mSOL token, the so-called “liquid-staking derivative,” or LSD, token that accesses the value of depositors’ locked-away SOL tokens while they generate yield from securing the Solana network.  More staked SOL means more staking interest for Marinade to take a cut of – fees that increase the protocol’s revenue. And more distributed MNDE governance tokens means more Solana DeFi protocols having a say in Marinade’s operations – increasing the protocol’s decentralization, according to its developers.  Pseudonymous Marinade developer Cerba said the effort will bring more legitimacy to mSOL, which is ahead of Lido’s Solana LSD token despite that big-name protocol’s dominance on the Ethereum blockchain.  “Basically, we think that mSOL must be pushed by more ecosystem actors to succeed as the most-used LSD on Solana,” he said.  “Marinade can push it to a point, but in the end, we both want other ecosystem actors to have MNDE and sit at the governance table, and we want them to integrate tightly with mSOL and have as many use cases as possible, to be a credible alternative to SOL.”  MNDE fell 4% in the hours following the announcement as traders digested Marinade’s plan to earmark 16% of the token’s total supply for an incentives program.  Liquid staking  Solana’s liquid-staking protocols are nowhere nearly as popular as Ethereum’s, where 33% of all staked ETH is wrapped up in LSD tokens from Lido and other staking-as-a-service providers. That’s compared with the 3% share on Solana, according to Marinade.  Network mechanics account for part of the disparity, Cerba said. As staked SOL is frozen for only three or so days at a time, and its stakers don’t have quite the same need for liquidity as ETH stakers, who can’t access their capital until the Shanghai upgrade, he said.  Ethereum’s looming upgrade has been driving more chatter around that ecosystem’s LSD scene and the protocols that serve it. That “can only be good news for awareness of liquid staking on Solana too,” said Brandon Tucker, head of communications for Marinade.",POSITIVE,ETH | SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | SOL,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/25/solana-liquid-staking-tool-marinade-looks-to-bolster-its-token-value-with-staked-sol-capture,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4c8dbe7d10939defdaaf1dfd5d8993983b54b141-1024x1024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42414570,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBBB6t,1674640800,Maple Finance Plots Comeback With New $100M Liquidity Pool for Tax Receivables With 10% Yield,"Blockchain-based credit marketplace Maple Finance unveiled on Wednesday a liquidity pool of trade receivables, the protocol’s first step in a new strategy to bring traditional financial investments onto the blockchain.  The new USDC stablecoin pool will enable firms to receive cash advances with a discount on their tax rebates and funding programs such as Employee Retention Credit (ERC) from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the U.S. federal tax authority.  Qualifying firms pledge their receivables as collateral to the loans, and investors in the liquidity pool will earn a return once the IRS transfers the credit.  The target yield of the liquidity pool is 10% annualized, with a minimum investment of $500,000 in USDC and 45-day lockup period. The pool will be open for accredited investors such as institutional asset managers and decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) treasuries, who must comply with know-your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering checks.  The pool can scale up to $100 million and AQRU will consider lowering the entry barrier once it reaches a certain size.  Maple provides the blockchain-based technology to set up and maintain the pools. London-based public company AQRU will manage the pool – the so-called pool delegate – overseeing applying firms and managing the loan book. The loan originator of the pool is Intero Capital Solutions, a financial firm specialized in receivables financing, who will use funds borrowed from the pool to lend to qualified companies in its network.  The new pool indicates that Maple is moving away from uncollateralized crypto lending to crypto trading firms, which resulted in $52 million in bad debt on the protocol and up to 80% losses for select liquidity providers. Those losses came after FTX’s spectacular collapse toppled some of the platform’s largest borrowers.  “Receivables financing is one of the oldest commercial finance products,” and AQRU hopes to get a “first mover advantage” by bringing this traditional investment strategy to crypto investors who are seeking conservative investments to earn a yield, Phil Blows, chief executive of AQRU, told CoinDesk in an interview.  In September, as the crypto winter weighed on the industry and raising capital became difficult, Maple launched a credit pool aimed at struggling bitcoin miners. The pool has yet to originate its first loan.  Last month, Maple unveiled a major overhaul of its protocol, winding down most of its active lending pools.  Read more: Maple Finance's $54M of Sour Debt Shows Risks of Crypto Lending Without Collateral  Real-world assets in crypto  Maple co-founder and CEO Sidney Powell said the AQRU-managed pool is the first of a slew of upcoming pools with yield-generating strategies adopted from traditional finance. Maple will soon unveil pools that invest in U.S. Treasury bonds and insurance refinancing, according to the protocol’s representative.  These new pools come as crypto and traditional capital markets are increasingly getting commingled on decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms that tokenize real-world assets (RWA) on the blockchain.  Analysts have predicted that yield-generating RWAs such as government bonds and corporate credit will be one of the hottest trends in crypto this year.

But right now, its native token AVAX seems to have found itself a new ceiling. According to Coingecko, AVAX is down 10% in the daily time frame, landing it a spot as one of the bigger losers as of today, January 25th. This has led to speculation that Avalanche’s most recent rally that was triggered by partnerships with Amazon Web Services and with Alibaba was just a so-called “buy the rumor, sell the news” event. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Network On Hyperdrive As TVL And NFT Trade Volume Soars The saying “buy the rumor, sell the news” describes a common trading technique in which investors buy a security on the basis of rumors about an impending news announcement or data, and then sell the asset once the news is out. This could afford the trader an opportunity to purchase the security before everyone else does so that he or she can sell it at a profit when demand and price rise. Image: CoinCentral External And Internal Forces Influence AVAX Although developments on-chain have been particularly bullish, external market forces seem to be the dominant force for the token’s slippage today. At the time of writing, Bitcoin and Ethereum have approached their respective resistances with no breakthroughs made by the two cryptos’ bulls. But with recent developments like the ecosystem’s partnership with Canadian e-commerce company Shopify, we might see Avalanche become more mainstream as consumers from Shopify familiarize themselves with the ecosystem. However, recent news shows that on-chain metrics have not improved since the announcement of the partnerships. Validator count still hovers around 1,200 ever since. The realm of DeFi also does not show promise for Avalanche. Image: DefiLlama According to DefiLlama, the ecosystem’s total value locked declined 3% since yesterday. This can be a sign of a slight loss in investor confidence as investors would have felt misled by the recent market movements. At $16.96, What’s In Store For Investors? Investors are somewhat bearish because of the recent rejection at $19. According to CoinGlass data, short sellers out-number the long buyers by a significant margin, adding to the overall bearish weight of the situation. Image: Coinglass If the token continues to do worse and closes today below $16.85, we might see the bears retest the $15.74 support range. However, on-chain developments should be able to keep up with the market’s current sentiment. With the token’s high correlation with Bitcoin and Ethereum, investors and traders should also monitor the price movements of these coins. As of writing, bears in the BTC market are retesting $22,661 support with ETH retesting $1,520 support at the same time.

The Self-Trade Prevention (STP) function will block the execution of orders that would result in a self-trade, an activity in which users trade with each other in order to create the illusion of there being more activity than there actually is.

In a Twitter post in early December Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said his firm didn't complete the SEC's ""qualification in time.""  The company behind USDC, the world’s second-largest stablecoin, had announced plans to go public in July 2021, with a valuation of $4.5 billion, which doubled in February 2022 when the company negotiated a new deal with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Concord Acquisition Corp., reflecting improvements in its financial outlook and competitive position.  According to the FT, Circle said that neither turbulent markets nor fearful investors were a factor in the abandonment of its SPAC deal.  “The business combination could not be consummated before the expiration of the transaction agreement because the SEC had not yet declared our S-4 registration ‘effective’,” the group said. An S-4 registration is a registration document that companies have to file with the SEC seeking permission to offer new shares, the report added.  Circle also said they never expected the SEC registration process to be quick, and that it's ""necessary, appropriate and reasonable for the SEC to have a thorough, rigorous review process.""  Contacted by CoinDesk, a Circle spokesperson denied the characterization of the FT article.  “Circle has not and does not blame the SEC for anything related to the mutual termination of our SPAC merger agreement with Concord, and any statements to the contrary are inaccurate,"" the spokesperson said.  ""As stated in December, 2022, the deal simply termed out,"" the spokesperson continued. ""Jeremy Allaire further stated on Twitter that the ‘SEC has been rigorous and thorough in understanding our business and many novel aspects of this industry.’”  The SEC did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's requests for comment.

The highly anticipated djed stablecoin has been jointly developed by Cardano code maintainer IOG and Coti, a layer 1 blockchain. Djed will be backed by other tokens and requires more than 400% in collateral value to be posted before it is issued to a user.  This overcollateralized mechanism would allow djed's value to hold stably during market stress and prevent a repeat of terraUSD, the infamous stablecoin linked to luna, which fell over 99% in May.  Djed is expected to go live on over 40 Cardano-based decentralized finance applications (dapps) on launch, as per a November report on The Block. Developers have simultaneously developed DjedPay, a payments application that uses djed, that would allow users to transfer the tokens to merchants and businesses.  The Cardano dapp ecosystem locks up over $72 million worth of tokens as of Wednesday, DefiLlama data shows.  Meanwhile, Coti developers said in the Tuesday post that holders of SHEN, a reserve token meant to support djed's stability, would receive extra rewards when holders of Cardano's ADA cryptocurrency stake their coins to mint djed stablecoins.  ""As part of our effort to stake the ADA that is deposited to the djed smart contract and generate extra rewards for SHEN holders, we are developing a snapshot mechanism and UI that will be added to djed.xyz, where SHEN holders will be able to track these extra rewards,"" developers said.

The Brisbane-based exchange is said to have held $33 million on FTX, the cryptocurrency exchange that collapsed in November, according to a report in The Guardian.  In December, Digital Surge had passed into voluntary administration, a process in which the management hands over control to licensed insolvency practitioners who independently assess its financial situation. Melbourne-based investment firm KordaMentha was appointed as administrators. The step was taken days after FTX and FTX Australia had initiated similar processes.  According to a deed of company arrangement (DoCA), the exchange will receive a loan of 1.25 million Australian dollars from an associated business, Digico, to allow it to function. Customers with under $250 will be repaid in full and others will receive at least 45% of their balance over five years.  “We thank customers for their engagement and involvement throughout this process, and for the 90% support we saw in favor of the DoCA,” said Digital Surge founder and CEO Dan Rutter.  The purported survival of the exchange is a rare outcome in a devastating crypto contagion that wiped out $1 trillion in value across the industry, with several major crypto firms filing for bankruptcy.  ""This is the first rescue package for a troubled crypto exchange in Australia,"" said Michael Bacina, partner, Piper Alderman, who was present at the creditors meeting.  A second meeting with creditors on Tuesday lasted more than four hours before the plan to pay back most customers over the next five years was approved. Approximately 22,000 of Digital Surge's customers had their digital assets frozen since Nov. 16 and more than half of the company's digital assets were held on FTX.

Ether and dogecoin led the slide among major tokens, falling more than 5%, Cardano's ADA and Polygon's MATIC dropped 4%, while bitcoin lost just 1.6%, CoinDesk data show.  Such movements caused upward of $173 million in longs, or bets on higher token prices, to be liquidated. Ether futures saw $86 million in liquidations while traders of bitcoin futures lost $46 million, per data source Coinglass.  Outside of majors, avalanche (AVAX) fell 7.7% while lido (LDO) dropped over 10%, ending a multi-week bump that saw the token's value jump 135% in the past month. Meanwhile, a few tokens traded in the green, including those of interoperable blockchain platform Quant (QNT) and layer 1 network Aptos (APT), with both rising over 4%.  The crypto market capitalization has decreased by 3.5% to just over $1 trillion in what appears to be a bull breather following a notable upswing. Strength in bitcoin and strong transactional activity among tokens such as SOL and ADA contributed to the crypto market regaining the $1 trillion capitalization mark earlier this month.  The pullback comes as U.S. equities fell on Tuesday after technical glitches at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) briefly disrupted market trading.

8085715,https://newsbtc.com/?p=517398,1674631391,Number of New Ethereum Smart Contracts Falls 60% in 2023,"Ethereum prices might be solid, and bulls are looking to drive the coin toward $1,700, but on-chain data points to dropping activity from developers judging from the number of new smart contracts deployed in the first three weeks of January. Number Of Smart Contracts Deployed On Ethereum Falling The number of new smart contracts deployed over the past few weeks, since the beginning of 2023, has fallen by more than half. The number of new smart contracts deployed on January 1, 2023, stood at 139,699. However, a total of 56,370 smart contracts were deployed on Ethereum on January 23, a solid recovery from the 10,079 figure registered on January 14, but still a long way from its January 1 levels. Related Reading: 80% Of Uniswap Holders Support BNB PoS Chain For Deploying V3 Protocol The contraction over the past three weeks represents a 60% drop from January 1 levels, a concern for analysts. Ordinarily, the number of contracts deployed on a smart contract network points to on-chain activity, and the more dApps there are on any frontier, in DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and more, the higher the probability that this activity could spill into price action since ETH, the native token of Ethereum, is used to settle network fees. Whenever there is a spike in on-chain activity, the demand for block space is higher, requiring developers to use more ETH for a slot in a block. Falling contracts deployment coincides with the exemplary performance of ETH prices over the month. ETH prices have rallied from $1,200 on January 1 to $1,659 on January 20. Even though bulls are yet to push the coin above $1,700, an immediate resistance level that, if broken, could see ETH prices float to new Q1 2023 highs. History shows a direct correlation between the number of contracts deployed and price action since developers often double down their efforts whenever prices are trending higher, deploying more contracts. This trend is not validated in the performance from early January, considering the divergence between spot prices and the number of contracts launched. Even though there was a near 5X spike between January 14 and January 23, there could be a significantly higher number of contracts if this action were aligned with ETH prices. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Drops 6% and Signals Risk of Trend Change Below This Support Nevertheless, smart contracts on the Ethereum network saw solid growth in 2022. A report by the software firm, Alchemy, showed that over 100,000 dApps were launched in 2022. Transaction Fees Falling The average transaction fee on Ethereum has been on the rise since the beginning of the year, according to data from Cryptoquant. From January 1, fees have more than doubled, rising from $2.92 to $3.99 on January 23. Even though fees are relatively higher now compared to the start of the year, they are multiples lower than in May 2022 when the average fee to post a simple transfer was $22. Subsequently, deploying smart contracts, depending on their complexity, was multiples higher.

The token has added more than 8.24% over the past 24 hours. Even the broader cryptocurrency market has recently seen tremendous improvement in its prices. Reports revealed that the cryptocurrency market outperformed the traditional equity market. QNT saw a 14-day gain of 26.8% and a 7-day price surge of 7.58%. These performances could be credited to improving economic conditions and recent improvements on the Quant Network. Related Reading: ApeCoin Buckles As News Of Stolen BAYC NFT Hits The Market What Factors Could Be Driving Quant Price Up? Quant Network is an interoperability-enabling platform launched to connect several blockchains effectively. The Quant token price often moves in response to changes in the U.S. economy. For example, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for December at 6.5% showed a value in line with market expectations. CPI is a metric in the United States that measures inflation. A higher CPI signifies high inflation, while a lower value indicates a reduction. The crypto market had positive sentiments before the CPI release, which boosted the sector, including QNT. Over the past weeks, Quant showed signs of a breakout from the descending channel. A movement above the descending channel often indicates a potential breakout, which drives the price upwards. This trend could also be one of the factors influencing Quant’s rally. Data indicates that Quant might have seen a double-bottom on the daily time frame while the cryptocurrency broke out of a channel that pushed the price action upwards. Also, Quant oscillators and the 7-day Moving Average is currently showing a strong buy. It could be among the factors driving QNT’s price upwards. Also, the fear and greed index is showing neutral. Latest developments on the Quant Network could also be among the factors driving the asset price upwards. The Quant Network designs secure bridges for asset transfer. Bridges are networks used for asset transfer from one network to another. But it is common knowledge that bridges are usually susceptible to hack attacks. Quant Price Predictions, will it Continue Soaring? QNT is currently trading at $154.91. The coin is above its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). The formation of a golden cross in the coming weeks is likely if the 50-day SMA crosses over the 200-day SMA. Quant’s support levels are $137.30, $139.09, and $141.27. It has broken its resistance levels at $145.24, $147.02, and $149.21. The token is currently under bullish pressure. A new resistance will form at the $164.67 level, with the old resistance levels turning to support. The formation of a long green candle today shows the bulls have controlled most of the trading activity. Quant’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) reading is 72.97, which is in the overbought region. That is also a bullish signal. The MACD (Moving Average Convergence/Divergence) is now above the signal line showing positive readings. Expect the positive trend to sustain for a few more weeks. Although the token might record a slight price correction, it will remain bullish for the short term. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whale Transfers $5M In DOGE To Coinbase, Bearish Signal?

42414571,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBBBCC,1674617092,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Seesaws Above and Below $23K Again,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin rises above $23K for the third time in four days. Other major cryptos are largely in the red.  Insights: Despite bitcoin's most recent surge, a number of analysts are wary about its path forward.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,050.91 −44.1 ▼ 4.0% Bitcoin (BTC) $22,598 −453.4 ▼ 2.0% Ethereum (ETH) $1,543 −92.5 ▼ 5.7% S&P 500 daily close  4,016.95 −2.9 ▼ 0.1% Gold  $1,934 −0.2 ▼ 0.0% Treasury Yield 10 Years  3.47% ▼ 0.1 BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices; gold is COMEX spot price. Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Bitcoin Tests $23.1K Before Retreating  By James Rubin  For the third time in four days, bitcoin clambered above $23,000 before falling back as markets continued their hopeful watch of improving macroeconomic conditions.  So far this week, no event has offset the recent narrative of falling inflation, gently slowing economic growth and a U.S. central bank primed to raise interest rates at a more moderate pace than in 2022.  BTC was recently trading at about $22,600, down 2% over the past 24 hours, although the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is still up more than 30% this year.  In an interview with CoinDesk ""First Mover"" TV, Matt Weller, global head of research for FOREX.com, said the recent rally stemmed from market dynamics, including the liquidation of ""a large short position."" Weller said he was now seeing ""a small element of that FOMO from traders who thought that they would have all this year to buy near the lows.""  ""Now that we start to see prices picking up, we're starting to see a lot of those traders throw in the towel and just jump in to make sure that they don't miss the big surge off the bottom that we're now seeing,"" he said. Ether fared less well, falling below $1,550 for the first time in a week. The second-largest crypto by market value was off 5.7% from Monday, same time. Other major cryptos declined later in the day to trade well in the red, with popular meme coins DOGE and SHIB down more than 7% and 8%, respectively, and ADA off 8%. The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, recently decreased about 4%.  Equity indexes traded sideways on Tuesday with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 down a few fractions of a percentage point as investors chewed over the latest earnings, a mixture of the decent (General Electric) and the lower (3M and Microsoft).  Crypto news also had its ups and downs, with JPMorgan analysts noting a pickup in crypto exchange Coinbase's trading this year even as rivals' volume has plunged. And a unit of Genesis Global Capital, the crypto lender that filed for bankruptcy protection in New York last week, claimed that longtime blockchain-industry veteran and Bitcoin Cash backer Roger Ver – sometimes referred to as “Bitcoin Jesus” based on his early evangelism for the industry – failed to settle cryptocurrency options trades.  The allegation against Ver by GGC International Limited was contained in a Jan. 23 filing to the New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan. Genesis is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group (DCG), a crypto conglomerate that also owns CoinDesk.  Meanwhile, FOREX.com's Weller said that institutions, not investors are behind this year's crypto price surge.  ""I don't think there's that those compelling new use cases yet that are driving retail back to the market,"" Weller said. It seems like the only people who are still sticking around on the retail side are those who have been through multiple cycles understand how volatile this market can be.""  He added: ""Recall that these institutions move so slowly, and they have to go through a board and put together a compelling case and get approval to gradually increase their allocations. And those decisions are not made lightly. Many of those processes started back in 2020, 2021. They're still ongoing and giving institutions a chance to buy for example, cheap bitcoin or [ether]. That's really what's put a floor under the market and could continue to support prices as we move through this year and beyond.""  Biggest Gainers  There are no gainers in CoinDesk 20 today.

By James Rubin  Is bitcoin's 2023 surge a harbinger of more good days to come or temporary respite from a 14-month bear market that has rocked the public's already shaky faith in crypto?  Analysts who have offered comments to CoinDesk this week have been largely skeptical of its prospects in the short-term, even as it has lingered near $23,000 for much of the past four days. Even with a late Tuesday decline, bitcoin's price has risen more than 30% this year.  Analysts' wariness underscores the ongoing fragility of crypto markets, the industry itself and wider economic conditions. And it also recognizes investors' ability this year to seize an opportunity following this month's more upbeat reports about inflation.  On Sunday, Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, noted ""a long consolidation period that saw shorts accumulating.""  ""The market has risen, partially fueled the short squeeze,"" DiPasquale wrote, but added that ""bitcoin and several altcoins are overheated and due for a correction. ""We wouldn’t be surprised to see bitcoin testing $20,000 in the coming days.""  ""For the week ahead, market participants should be mindful of downside risks and potentially seek to take profits.""  And on Tuesday, Matt Weller, global head of research for FOREX.com, attributed the rally to market dynamics, including the liquidation of ""a large short position."" Weller said he was now seeing ""a small element of that FOMO from traders who thought that they would have all this year to buy near the lows.""  In an email Tuesday, Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, struck a more upbeat tone, even as he noted that ""the recent rally couldn’t break above the $23,500 level, which could lead to ""a minor dip towards the $22,000 region.""  ""When all the dust settles from Q4 GDP, the [Federal Reserve’s] preferred inflation gauge, and the FOMC decision, strong resistance should come from the $25,000 level. Bitcoin’s rally is about to get very interesting or it could be ripe for a short-term pullback,"" Moya wrote.

8027816,https://newsbtc.com/?p=517335,1674607912,80% Of Uniswap Holders Support BNB PoS Chain For Deploying V3 Protocol,"Uniswap (UNI), a decentralized protocol, is ready to roll out the third version of its platform. The protocol aims to provide a suitable platform where users can seamlessly swap ERC-20 tokens without using an order book. For the v3 launch, the protocol carried out a ‘temperature test’ for a possible blockchain to use. The proposal was for deploying Uniswap v3 on the Binance Smart Chain (BNB) instead of the Ethereum blockchain. The proposal got the UNI community voting on its government forum using their UNI tokens. Related Reading: Bullish Indicator: Bitcoin Shakes Off Genesis Bankruptcy Filing Surprisingly, about 80% of the UNI holders supported the Uniswap v3 deployment on the BNB Chain, Ethereum’s rival. Unfortunately, this left a smaller percentage of votes for the Ethereum blockchain, making it lose the temperature check proposal. 🦄 We’re excited to share that our @0xPlasma proposal to deploy @Uniswap v3 on @BNBCHAIN has passed the ""Temperature Check"" with 20M votes ""YES"" and 6,495 $UNI voters (the biggest number for the whole Uniswap Governance History). Moving forward to the final ""Governance Proposal"" pic.twitter.com/HoIJgY8mX1 — 0xPlasma Labs: DeFi & NFT Metaverse 🦇 🔊 (@0xPlasma) January 22, 2023 0xPlasma Labs, a decentralized finance protocol, contributes to the proposal. According to the post on Twitter, the firm noted that the “Temperature Check” on the proposal got 20 million votes for ‘YES.’ In addition, the supporting votes came from 6,495 $UNI voters, the most significant voting numbers in the history of Uniswap’s Governance system. 0xPlasma Labs’ CEO Lists Benefits of Deploying Uniswap V3 on BNB Chain Recently, the CEO of 0xPlasma Labs, Ilia Maksimenka, wrote a proposal for deploying the Uniswap v3 protocol. The CEO lined his argument on the benefits of deploying the new v3 protocol on the BNB Chain. Maksimenka cited the License expiration of Uniswap as one of the reasons for choosing BNB Chain. Also, he mentioned that the chain has many packages that would help boost Uniswap’s popularity in the DeFi space. Some include high transactions, low fees, staking opportunities, cross-chain support, etc. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Price Could See Another 30% Rally Also, the CEO acknowledged that Binance had acquired a global presence, being rated as the largest crypto exchange in the world. Hence, as a strong brand, using the BNB Chain will fast-forward the awareness and adoption of the v3 version globally for Uniswap. The Proposal Gets Support The proposal has received support from other firms and crypto participants. For example, ConsenSys, a blockchain software company behind one of Ethereum’s most important clients, is optimistic about the deployment move. The DAO governance strategist at ConsenSys, Cameron O’Donnell, revealed the company’s stance. First, the firm noted the need for Uniswap to be agnostic in its service to users, especially in the Web3 space, even with its license expiration in April. Hence, O’Donnell maintained that existing and future platform users would enjoy a secured and robust platform for decentralized exchange through the BSC market. Other supporting comments came from Brian-Armstrong, CEO at Coinbase, and Modong also optimistic about the deployment of Uniswap v3 on BNB Chain. The Plasma Finance team started its operation after the Uniswap governance community approved the proposal. The team noted that it could take five to eight weeks to deploy all the relevant Uniswap smart contracts to the BNB Chain. The price performance of UNI was entirely on the positive lane over the past 30 days. The token gained over 28% in the past month and has shown a slight increase of 0.38% in the past seven days. But at the time of writing, UNI is trading at $6.60, indicating a drop within the past 24 hours.

42411248,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMVSc,1674605172,Porsche's NFT Debut Is a Reminder to Let Web3 Natives Take the Wheel,"“Is it still OK to get a physical Porsche tho?” said Alfonso (Fonz) Olvera, CEO of non-fungible token [NFT] ownership platform Tokenproof, on Twitter Tuesday morning.  “Wen Kia mint? I’m sure I could afford that,” he joked in another tweet.  Olvera’s tweets reflect the broader sentiments felt by some in the NFT community in response to German carmaker Porsche’s debut NFT collection, which opened for minting on Monday. While users took to Twitter to poke fun at the project as it struggled to gain traction in the hours post-launch, the stalled mint served as a lesson to companies on how to build a Web3 strategy with community input at the forefront.  The legacy sports car manufacturer opened its mint on Monday morning, pricing each NFT – a digital replica of the iconic 911 model – at 0.911 ether (ETH), or about $1,490. The company teased future integrations for holders, including the ability to customize the design and rarity of their NFTs.  But it appears Porsche could have used some roadside assistance in its project rollout. As of Tuesday afternoon, only around 1,600 of the 7,500 NFTs had been minted, and many NFTs were selling on secondary marketplaces like OpenSea for less than the mint price.  Noting the lack of momentum, Porsche put its project in reverse and said that it would halt its mint. “Our holders have spoken,” its official account tweeted.  Building a project for the community  In the 24 hours since the project opened its mint, NFT creators and collectors took to Twitter to voice their frustrations about how the project was created, marketed and sold.  During the hype cycle of 2021 and the beginning of 2022, many brands were eager to jump into Web3 through NFT projects, crypto payments and metaverse integrations. Some viewed the endeavors as central to transforming their business strategy and embracing a digitally-native audience, while others saw an opportunity to capitalize on a perceived short-term trend.  To many enthusiastic collectors, artists, creatives, builders and gamers, NFTs and Web3 technology is no passing fad. In fact, many view Web3 as the inevitable future progression of the internet, where power and ownership are placed back into the hands of creators.  “Web3 isn’t a new pool of consumers for brands to extract from, it is an opportunity to provide new value for consumers and curate a community around the brand.” Betty, co-founder of the popular NFT collection Deadfellaz, told CoinDesk.  In recent years, we’ve seen large companies tap into blockchain strategies with varying levels of success. Whether digital collectibles, virtual wearables or tokenized utility, companies that have focused on building projects for the long term, hiring staff who understand Web3 and cultivating their community have seen positive results.  In November, Nike released .SWOOSH, a community-based platform to create and purchase digital wearables like shoes and sports jerseys. It also serves as an educational platform to help onboard its massive audience of sneaker enthusiasts to Web3. The platform is set to release its first NFT collection this year.  In the lead-up to this point, Nike spent several years building relationships and learning about NFTs, metaverse platforms and blockchain technology so it could get the project right. In early 2020, it began testing an RFID chip in its sneakers to log data on the blockchain. A year later, it purchased digital wearables company RTFKT to bring its virtual footwear into the metaverse.  Other brands have chosen to tap into existing NFT communities to release products that are created specifically for holders. In August 2022, jewelry company Tiffany & Co created a collection of diamond necklaces for holders of CryptoPunk NFTs.  Global coffee giant Starbucks has even chosen to revamp its wildly popular loyalty program by placing it on the blockchain. In December, it rolled out a closed beta test for its Odyssey rewards program, integrating features to help onboard newcomers into Web3 (for example, users can purchase NFTs in the app without purchasing crypto or setting up a wallet).  It’s certainly not an easy feat for a massive global brand to meaningfully integrate emerging technologies into its existing framework. However, those that have made the leap have shared strategies for making the transition easier.  Keith Grossman, president of Moonpay and former president of Time magazine, who helped bring the publication into Web3 with its NFT collection TIMEPieces, told CoinDesk that brands must look at Web3 as a way to deepen consumer engagement.
