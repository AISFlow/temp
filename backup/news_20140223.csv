She said the CBJ had been ""following the issue of bitcoin very closely over the past two months"". Another official source told the paper that some people in Jordan and around the region were already trading digital currencies ""using phoney names"".  Locals undeterred  A member of the Jordan Bitcoin Group told CoinDesk they were not too discouraged by the announcement, and would continue to advocate for bitcoin in the local media:  ""The warning is unfortunate, but it isn't stopping small businesses and merchants from accepting bitcoin. This Saturday, a cafe started accepting bitcoin, and is already attracting new customers.""  The CBJ's statement is the latest in a string of similar decrees to come out of central banking authorities since the end of last year, and the third we've seen from the Middle East after the nearby central banks of Lebanon and Israel issued warnings on 19th December and 19th February, respectively.  Central banks and bitcoin  The central bank statements, which have ranged in tone from advisory to graver warnings of illegal activity and even bans, have all included the common themes that bitcoin and others are not officially regarded as currencies, cannot be guaranteed by central banks and may suffer dramatic price fluctuations.  However, bitcoin and digital currency news has been scarce from the Middle East, so the overall affect of the announcement is perhaps unclear.  Other than the bank warnings, the only other story to emerge recently was Dubai's Pizza Guys starting to accept bitcoin just a few days ago.

42425490,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIDwzh,1393171234,Following the Money: Trends in Bitcoin Venture Capital Investment,"CoinDesk is releasing its 'State of Bitcoin 2014' report on Tuesday, which takes an in-depth look into the evolution of bitcoin and the potential hurdles it is still yet to face.  This article is the first of a two-part series drawn from the report. The series looks at the trends in venture capital investment in bitcoin.  It assesses how venture investment in bitcoin to date compares with other related investment sectors (eg financial technology), or previous major waves of investment (eg the Internet).  It also examines the types of Bitcoin companies venture investors have focused their funding on.  Look out for part two, which will be published tomorrow and focuses on which regions have been receiving the lion's share of venture investment in bitcoin.  Venture investment: early Internet vs early bitcoin  Venture capitalist and Internet pioneer Marc Andreessen recently compared the current understanding of bitcoin's overall potential, as well as its current stage of development, to the Internet circa 1993 and the PC in 1975.  Does the level of venture capital invested in bitcoin to date reflect Andreessen's assessment?    Table 1: VC Investments in Bitcoin Companies, 2012-Present    Comparing this bitcoin investment to date with investment in the early Internet, (Table 2) reveals that that significantly less funding (approximately 20%) has been allocated to Bitcoin compared to Internet startups, which pulled in just over $500m in venture investment in 1995.  Table 2: VC Investments in US Internet Companies, 1995  With regards to the above comparison, there are several important caveats. First, due to data availability limitations there is no way to compare the Internet investments circa 1993 with bitcoin 2014, as 1995 is the earliest year in which we have Internet investment data.[1]  The above Internet investment data also reflect only US investments as global data are not available. While the vast majority of early Internet investment was US-based the $507m figure likely understates total global Internet investment in 1995.  On the Bitcoin side, the $97.5m in venture capital that has been publicly reported underestimates the total, which would include unreported venture investment, by tens of millions of dollars.  For example, we know that Andreessen Horowitz has invested just under $50m in bitcoin-related startups, and that Coinbase and Ripple have only received $25m and $9 million, respectively, in rounds which Andreessen Horowitz may have participated. CoinDesk is also aware of, but not privy to disclose, other million-dollar-plus funding rounds in Bitcoin startups, and these figures are, therefore, excluded from this analysis.      Also, it has been estimated that upwards of $200m has been invested in bitcoin mining hardware and infrastructure to date, a figure which exceeds even a less conservative estimate of the total venture capital invested in bitcoin to date. Perhaps the appropriate Internet analogy to this mining hardware investment is to compare it to the significant fiber optic and broadband infrastructure investments that was occurring alongside the investment in Internet startups.  Chart 1: Number of VC-backed Companies: early Internet vs early bitcoin    Looking at the number of deals from 1995, we can see a total of 156 total funding rounds, with nearly two-thirds of the rounds being first sequence financings.  In contrast, all but one Bitcoin startup financing round (Coinbase's November 2013 $25m Series B) have been first or seed round investments.  In short, the data fit Andreessen's story that the current Bitcoin investment lifecycle is relatively less mature than the Internet's circa 1995, and perhaps more akin to where the Internet investment environment stood in 1993.  Chart 2: VC Investment in 1995 Internet Companies vs bitcoin    Looking at the data on VC investments in Internet companies for 1995, we can also see that a much greater sum of funding was directed towards Internet companies than has been directed at Bitcoin startups to date (Chart 2).  In 1995 there was $508m invested in Internet companies, an amount which was just about evenly split between first sequence and later stage financings. Over 50% of Internet startup funding was going to just one-third of the venture-backed Internet companies.  According to the National Venture Capital Association there was $7.2 billion invested in Internet companies based in the U.S. from 1995-2013. If VCs are proven correct that Bitcoin represents an opportunity on par with the Internet then we can expect investment in Bitcoin startups to increase by an order of magnitude or more from current levels.  30 VC-backed bitcoin startups across five distinct sectors  There have been 30 bitcoin companies in total that have received publicly-reported venture funding to date (see Table 3).

The universe of venture-backed Bitcoin companies can be broadly classified into the following five distinct sectors:  Exchanges – companies that operate a bitcoin trading platform (eg BTC China)  Financial Services – the broadest category, including everything from bitcoin ATM operators (eg BitAccess) to white label exchange providers (eg Buttercoin) to alternative payment networks (eg Ripple) to bitcoin gift cards (eg GogoCoin)  Mining Hardware – producers of bitcoin mining equipment like ASICs (eg BitFury)  Payment Processors – outsourced virtual alternative currency payment solutions (eg BitPay)  Wallets – secure storage and transfer mechanisms for digital alternative currency. Several payment processors also have wallets (eg Gliph)    Chart 3: Sector distribution of Bitcoin VC investment    Payment Processors lead the way in terms of total share of VC investment (38%), followed by Financial Services (23%) and Exchanges (14%). Pure-play wallets are the smallest category at 1% of total VC investment.  It's not surprising to see that Bitcoin Payment Processors are receiving such a large share of venture funds. In a previous analysis we saw that processors, such as Visa and Mastercard, hold the largest market capitalizations (over $200 billion between the two companies) in traditional financial services sectors which Bitcoin could potentially disrupt.  It is interesting to note the relatively small VC investment in mining hardware companies (13%) given that it is very likely the largest legal revenue generating sector of the bitcoin economy with over $200m in mining hardware revenue to date.  Table 4: VC Investments by Industry, 2013 ($m) for United States    While by no means insignificant, the $97.5m in publicly disclosed venture capital invested in bitcoin companies to date (Table 1) is relatively small compared with other investment sectors that have been beneficiaries of significant venture capital investment (Table 4).  The grey shaded areas of Table 4 are intended to highlight bitcoin-related investment sectors. For example, investments in bitcoin wallets could perhaps fall into more than one category, including Software and Financial Services.  Part two of this series, which will be published tomorrow, examines where the majority of VC investment in bitcoin companies has come from. Silicon Valley, surely? Not necessarily …  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------      [1]  Notes on sources and methodology: unfortunately, the earliest industry-wide venture capital historical data is for 1995, two full years after the year Andreessen compares the Internet to bitcoin (1993). Bitcoin investment data spans 2012-early 2014 because the vast majority of bitcoin investments to date occurred in 2013. Please also note that no adjustment has been made for a number of other factors, such as inflation or changes in the cost of launching a startup over the past two decades.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING,Garrick Hileman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/02/23/following-the-money-trends-in-bitcoin-venture-capital-investment,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/678e7ea12ee048cddf2abd5ab4797e45faa817f1-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425485,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIDwph,1393157977,Market-Based Reactions to New Bitcoin Regulation,"Every action has a reaction, and the world of government regulation is no different. Recently, the regulatory chatter has picked up around Bitcoin and it appears to be focused on two major mandates as perceived by the financial regulators.  Number one is the attempt to apply invasive technology-specific money transmitter regulation to a technology that doesn't seem to fit into any of their other regulatory boxes. Licenses are being crafted to ensure the same level of AML (Anti-Money Laundering) and KYC (Know Your Customer) guidelines for bitcoin companies as for other types of existing financial institutions.  Number two is protecting us ""from ourselves"" under the standard guise of consumer protection and fraudulent operators. In an interview on The Bitcoin Group, Andreas Antonopoulos describes a self-regulating method where the consumer protection holes can be solved by free market-enforced exchange solvency and implemented cryptography solutions.  New York-Style Licensing  Regarding technology-specific regulation at the state level, New York has put forth a bad idea with an unfortunate name, mostly because it sounds like an innovative Silicon Valley startup which it definitely is not.  It is, however, a grand attempt from a local regulator to overlay an inappropriate technology-specific regulation within the confines of the great state of New York.  Unfortunately, this will cause greater hardship for New Yorkers than it will for the bitcoin businesses that will most likely seek out other favorable jurisdictions. If New York wanted to drive new growth businesses away from the state, then this would be the way to do it. These antics are not predicted to be emulated.  Markets perceive regulation as 'damage' and route around it. This is true with Internet-related damage and it is equally true with Bitcoin-related damage.  For example, artificial damage to bitcoin's semi-anonymous properties could be inflicted by tracking specific bitcoin addresses at the exchange endpoint level and beyond. Perhaps mandated by law in the near future, this type of regulatory action would be akin to to registering bank note serial numbers during a routine cash withdrawal.  Most people would reel in horror at the prospect of this because they naturally believe that they have a right to use their cash as they see fit without serial number tracking.  Surveillance techniques  Coin tracking and coin validation schemes are new types of surveillance techniques that Bitcoin's public transaction ledger enables. Interestingly, either the free market or the law could spawn these invasive techniques as a business model.  In the case of an exchange seeking to bolster its compliance reputation, it might turn to an independent service provider that analyzes bitcoin address data and associated traffic patterns known to be involved in crimes.  Of course, the major underlying and still unresolved problem here is that subjective judgement must be exercised in data analysis of this type which could unduly harm the downstream owners of fungible bitcoin. That is, if anyone held title in bitcoin to begin with.  Markets provide solutions to these cases of bitcoin privacy 'damage' and this is where it becomes tricky for regulators. They are practically in a no-win situation because regulators must use their tools to regulate, but the more they do, the more they inadvertently encourage market-based responses.  Fortuitously, Bitcoin comes with built-in plausible deniability due to the many 'mixing' hops that can be traversed both on-block chain and off-block chain. Unless the user's private key is seized, no one can prove with absolute certainty that a particular amount of bitcoin is owned by an individual without their consent. In financial privacy terms, this is referred to as ""knowledge of balance"" privacy and it is a key element of overall financial privacy.  Mixing services  As cited in 'The Politics of Bitcoin Mixing Services', mixing services for bitcoin may emerge as the next frontier in the battle for financial privacy. Coin mixing services for cryptocurrencies do not violate any laws and they merely attempt to re-balance natural deficiencies in the protocol.  According to CNBC, Ben Lawsky and New York's Department of Financial Services are ""still wrestling with whether to ban or restrict the use of 'tumblers,' which obscure the record and source of virtual currencies."" Lawsky said tumblers are a concern to law enforcement although they might have legitimate uses.  [post-quote]  Is it even possible for New York to ban tumblers that exist on the global Internet? How will the cryptographic free market respond to encroaching regulation into the market for Bitcoin?  Zerocoin and CoinJoin represent two attempts to restore the balance in making digital cash as private as physical cash today. They operate in a decentralized manner without requiring trust in a third party.  Originating from Johns Hopkins University, the first Zerocoin plan was a proposed extension to the Bitcoin payment network that added anonymity to Bitcoin payments and used provably secure cryptographic techniques to ensure that Bitcoins cannot be traced.  After refusing to gain traction among the bitcoin user and developer communities, creators Matthew Green and Ian Miers decided to launch Zerocoin as its own independent cryptocurrency complete with separate block chain and reward incentive system. The Economist refers to Zerocoin as ""washing virtual money"".  CoinJoin  , first described by Gregory Maxwell as a method of increased coin privacy for the real world, is an urgently needed improvement, because:  ""Bitcoin is often promoted as a tool for privacy but the only privacy that exists in Bitcoin comes from pseudonymous addresses which are fragile and easily compromised through reuse, 'taint' analysis, tracking payments, IP address monitoring nodes, web-spidering, and many other mechanisms. Once broken this privacy is difficult and sometimes costly to recover.""  Involving no changes to the Bitcoin protocol but requiring specific wallet implementations, CoinJoin operates as a unique transaction style for Bitcoin users to dramatically improve their privacy.  Both efforts succeed where the original Bitcoin protocol stopped short. In direct response to increasing and potentially onerous regulations, Zerocoin and CoinJoin stand as pillars of financial privacy in a world where surveillance has run amok.  Ultimately, society can have hope that if privacy becomes disrespected, the market can and will provide cryptographic solutions to restore the balance. If Bitcoin is to succeed, that is the real challenge for the talented individuals and leading companies in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

42425489,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIDwvh,1393152652,How Cash Would Be Seen by the Media if Invented Today,"Antonis Polemitis is Managing Director of Ledra Capital. He has written a series of blog posts about bitcoin which can be found here. In this article, he casts a satirical eye over how a new currency 'cash' would be described by the press if invented today.  Breaking News: Bizarre, Shadowy, Paper-Based Payment System Being Rolled Out Worldwide!  World governments announced a plan today to allow citizens to anonymously carry parts of their wealth on their person and exchange it with others using small pieces of colourful paper.  The paper is printed with nationalistic and Masonic imagery, along with numbers that purportedly represent the amount of wealth each piece of paper represents (if the paper is not a counterfeit).  Each of these pieces of paper is formally a ‘note’ from each nation's central bank, but they are also attracting the term ‘cash’. This is a technical matter that is too complex to cover in our basic primer. Suffice it to say, that it is representative of the complexity and user-unfriendliness of this new system.  Are ‘bills’ too complex?  These pieces of papers (also known as ‘bills’, ‘dollar bills’, ‘George Washingtons’ or ‘Dead Presidents’ among the shadowy community of anti-banking libertarians who have been the primary users of cash to date) will differ from country to country and are not redeemable outside national borders.    In what will come as a surprise to generations who have grown up with calculators and computers, bills only come in fixed denominations, requiring users to maintain a large number of these pieces of paper that must be aggregated to execute a transaction and then re-aggregated to ‘make change’.    The latter is a complex process of returning to the payee the excess of the payment using yet other bills. (Don’t worry if this sounds complex, we had trouble understanding it ourselves at first and it is certainly not ready for the average consumer in its current form.)    Mike Smith, VP of Employee Training at Sears has said:    “I cannot imagine training tens of thousands of our employees to use cash, verify that it is genuine, and learn to ‘make change’ without making errors. This is going to require a wholesale installation of special change-making hardware – so-called ‘cash registers’ – and millions of dollars of employee training, while creating long lines and delays for consumers. Furthermore, we would need to adopt new security procedures and armed guards to avoid theft of the physical bills while in the store or during transport to our bank. We cannot see ourselves adopting cash under these conditions.”  Perfect tool for criminals  Mike Smith, the recently confirmed FBI Director, had this to say:    “‘Cash’ is a 100% anonymous and untraceable payments technology. It is like a weapon of mass destruction launched against law enforcement. It is the perfect payment mechanism for criminals, drug cartels, terrorists, prostitution rings and money launderers. We don’t know how we will be able to combat such a technology and we fully expect that a new generation of super-criminals will emerge, working in the shadows of a world where they can conduct their illicit affairs without leaving a trace.”              Even officials within the banking system have their doubts about the new plan.    Banking Superintendent of New York State Mike Smith said: “I can’t think of any reason that a law-abiding individual would want to use ‘cash’. At a bare minimum, we believe there should be a licensing procedure for individuals or businesses that plan to use cash – a ‘cash license’, as it were.""  This license would limit cash to trustworthy individuals who keep detailed, auditable records of all their cash transactions in order to keep New York safe from criminals, he added.    Others have concerns about forgery and counterfeiting.    “Ultimately, even with all the fancy inks, ‘cash’ is just a piece of paper. We fully expect criminal groups and rogue nation states to print fake cash in order to profit or to disrupt the economies of their enemies,” said Mike Smith, an analyst at Stratfor.  “In the interim, we are certain that cash will trade a discount in the real world, given the risk to a counterparty of accepting a forged piece of paper; no doubt cash is a huge step back from the modern cryptography in place throughout our current financial system.”  Consumers unprotected    Though hard to imagine, cash operates with no consumer protection at all. If your ‘bills’ are stolen or lost, they are gone forever.      “I just don’t understand why there is nobody that I can call to reinstate my ‘cash’ if I lose it,” says Mike Smith, a businessman from Toledo. “What type of idiotic wealth and payment system doesn’t maintain transaction and ownership records?”      Moreover, there appears to be no authentication mechanism associated with cash payments or transfers, let alone one that matches modern security standards. Once someone has gained physical control of your ‘bills’, they are free to spend or use them as they wish and there is no way to reverse the transaction, stop them or even identify who has stolen them.    Even simple destruction of a bill, which, as you recall, is just a piece of paper, could result in losses. According to the Director of the newly founded Bureau of Engraving and Printing, mutilated bills that are more than 51% destroyed must be mailed in for a special investigation that will determine if they should be replaced or not.  ‘Physical wallets’ reveal security flaw    “Once your bills are safely ensconced in your Gucci wallet and securely placed in your pants pocket [the front pocket is recommended as a ‘best practice’ for security], it is almost impossible for them to be stolen, lost or destroyed,” said Mike Smith, VP of Communications for Gucci NA.      Some early adopters, however, have reported that the hardware wallets have security flaws.    “I was out in Bangkok two weeks ago, at a bar, and I forgot my Gucci wallet there,” said Mike Smith, a visiting tourist. “When I returned the next morning, my wallet was there but my cash was gone!”  We contacted Gucci regarding this hacking attack, but a spokesperson would not comment “about confidential customer financial matters”.    Even criminals have not been immune to the risks of cash. The notorious ‘Silk Road’ drug-dealing marketplace mysteriously closed last week, after vendors and customers left envelopes full of cash (on which they had very clearly written their names) in an anonymous drop-box managed by the exchange.    “Theft of the cash due to a bug in the envelope-sealing process,” was cited as the cause.  While technical experts believe that it might be possible that the glue on the envelope was not correctly applied, they also warn that a ‘bill’ is basically a private and public key at the same time, and note that there might be dangers involved in letting anonymous criminals hold the private keys to your wealth.  Physical presence required    In what might be most unusual limitation on cash, it only works for payments within 26 inches or less (the so-called ‘arm’s length transaction’, as hackers in the community have colourfully dubbed it), because it has to be handed from one (human) party to another to execute the transaction.      This requirement for the exchange of cash is widely thought to be a fatal flaw by traditionalists.      Mike Smith, VP of Retail Banking at Chase said:    “A form of payment that cannot be used at a distance, cannot be used for e-commerce, cannot be used by mobile devices, cannot be used for machine-based transactions, or cannot be scripted or programmed, cannot be thought of as a payment system. I will admit, as a form of performance art, ‘cash’ transactions are an amusing experiment, but this has no applicability in the real world of banking, finance or commerce.""  He added: “Furthermore, given cash’s association with criminal activities, we will be refusing to offer banking services and terminating the accounts of any customer that uses cash in a business or personal capacity. It is the only way we can ensure we remain compliant with our regulatory obligations.”    Remarkably, if you attempt to use cash in a different country from the one that issued it, it will categorically be rejected.    In order to use cash abroad, you will have to go to designated points, usually in airports or certain banks, with limited hours of operation, that will ‘exchange’ your bills for others printed by the country that you are visiting.  These ‘exchanges’ have high fees – usually 2-3% for each exchange, meaning that tourist will lose 5% of their cash or more on a typical trip just in these exchange costs. This seems extraordinarily high for what is, ultimately, an exercise in multiplication or division.  A step backward for economics    Economists are flabbergasted that lawmakers have allowed cash to be adopted despite their strong objections. A key policy tool of central banks has been the use of positive and negative interest rates to manage economic growth. It appears that this will not be possible with cash.      Mike Smith, a leading economics blogger for the New York Times said: “This is a sad day for macro-economics. If cash ever catches on in any meaningful sense, it will reduce our control over the levers of the economy significantly, by providing a mechanism for depositors to opt out of negative interest rates. Given the fact that it might keep us from preventing the next depression and will definitely reduce tax collections, one could even consider it ‘evil’.”    Environmental and health impacts  Mike Smith, recently appointed Executive Director of the Sierra Club said: “You would have thought that in 2014, we would have moved beyond pesticide- and water-intensive cotton farming [retracted: cutting down trees], treating the cotton with dangerous inks, and transporting it with fossil fuels, only to represent a value, such as ‘20’, that can be represented electronically at effectively no cost to the environment. When will we ever learn?”    Public health officials also warned that cash could be an excellent vector for disease transmission.    “We tested several ‘bills’ in our labs recently and discovered that the average bill has 20 times more bacteria than a toilet seat,” said Mike Smith, Director of Research at the Mayo Clinic. “Our advice is that people should avoid cash in general and only handle it if absolutely necessary.“  “Children, the elderly and immuno-compromised individuals should not handle cash under any circumstances.”  What comes next?    Proponents of cash think it will ultimately be a widely adopted technology that will spread around the world, enabling in-person, mid-tier transactions (not micro-payments, but not mega-payments either) in a manner that is invulnerable to electric or Internet outages and that will usher in a new era of more ‘human’ commerce.      We try to keep an open mind at this publication toward new technology, but, to date, we have a hard time seeing the positive case for cash.    Certainly criminal groups will take advantage of cash’s perfect anonymity to wreak havoc on law enforcement and tax collection, something that is deeply undesirable.  Among law-abiding citizens, we can envision some possible adoption in dense urban hipster communities like Williamsburg, where ‘wallets’, ‘cash’ and ‘making change’ could be yet another reflection of their tongue-in-cheek view of modern societal systems.  Other than that, it would be hard to recommend that the average consumer or merchant becomes involved in what is still today a very buggy system, filled with risk, inconvenience, high transaction costs, and possible disease transmission.  Even if handled perfectly, cash will certainly tar your business and personal life with the seedy reputation of the drug dealers, terrorists, money launderers and anti-establishment anarchists who use it today, threatening business and banking relationships, and raising eyebrows among law enforcement and your community.

42425477,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIDwZh,1393148714,How Bitcoin Could Revolutionise Accountancy,"Nick Chowdrey is a business and technology writer and proud digital native. Currently based in Brighton, UK, he is a technical writer at Crunch Accounting and co-founder of Brighton-based bitcoin community, Bitcoin Brighton. Here, he explores whether or not bitcoin could render accountants obsolete.      Towards the end of last year, CoinDesk published a piece suggesting four career fields bitcoin could replace. One of these careers was accounting. I wanted to investigate further into whether this could actually happen.      It’s no secret that online accounting firms are already disrupting the industry, offering a cheaper and often more convenient service than their ‘bricks and mortar’ ancestors.      Moving accounting online makes the process quicker and more convenient. Users can update their accounts using smartphone apps and ‘optical character recognition’ helps to automate data entry. It doesn’t take too much of a leap to see how the Bitcoin protocol could further enhance these processes.    How bitcoin can help    On a basic level, the payment network could be used by firms to more easily accept international customers. You’d expect this to increase competition and it could eventually lead to offline firms across the world being priced out of the market.      But even if this does happen, surely these online firms will still need to employ some human accountants? Actually, it seems that not only could Bitcoin be used to automate a lot of accounting functions, it could, in some cases, actually do a better job.      For example, one of the most important accounting tasks is balancing the books – checking that incoming and outgoing transactions match an individual or company’s actual bank balance. Modern financial accounting uses a ‘double entry’ system which requires two separate accounts to be updated depending on the transaction.      For example, if you receive a payment of £100 you increase a credits account by 100 and decrease a debits account by 100, and vice versa if you pay someone £100. If the books are balanced, the debit account plus the credit account should equal zero.      Every entry is dated, with additional information added if necessary, making it possible for accountants to go back through the records and find the problem if the books aren’t balanced. This is a straightforward way for people to trust their own accounts.      Increasingly, however, outside parties like tax collectors and investors also need to trust that a set of accounts is accurate and fully disclosed, requiring expensive audit services. This is where bitcoin comes in.    Triple entry    What would be required is for every transaction between a debtor/creditor to be processed through the Bitcoin network, as well as a record being kept in both the debtor and creditor’s private, offline accounts.      This creates a system of ‘triple entry’ bookkeeping where accounting entries are distributed across the Bitcoin network and cryptographically sealed, making the falsification or destruction of the records practically impossible and ultimately reducing fraud.      This would be an excellent way to save time and money for an open and transparent business that wants to, for example, publicly share its accounts with a potential investor; or for a freelancer who needs to submit a tax return.      Also, thanks to projects like Mastercoin and Ethereum, which will enable other properties to be transferred over the Bitcoin network, the cryptographic transactions wouldn’t even have to involve the transfer of any actual bitcoins, or anything of real monetary value.      It would be more like an exchange of contracts that each party cryptographically signs, saying: “I promise that I paid X party X amount of X currency.” Having said this, it would ultimately make more sense for these contracts to execute the actual payments too, which is also perfectly possible.      At this point, it’s worth saying that bookkeeping is by no means the only thing that accountants do. Certainly, at online accounting firms today, accountants take on a more advisory role, spending less time on tiresome data entry and more time speaking to actual clients and investigating their problems.      This could lead to better service, perhaps explaining the increasing popularity of online accountants.      So, will Bitcoin totally replace accountants? I’m not sure it’s possible. Will it streamline and optimise the industry, just as we expect it to do in other areas of finance? I think almost definitely.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION,Nick Chowdrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/02/23/how-bitcoin-could-revolutionise-accountancy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4edcc9932d8f32c65f470c84527c71b79ba7ae15-1000x674.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
