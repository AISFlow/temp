If so, look for projects with the highest funding and the longest staying power. Though Ethereum dominates, there will be room for niche players like NEAR and Solana. NEAR’s helping corporations transition from Web2 to Web3. Web3 has several advantages including data-ownership & portability, censorship resistance, privacy, and community governance. This is one of the highest-rated projects according to my Ratings Scorecard. NEAR is valued cheaply as measured by Price/Book Value. Thesis We may or may not be in a Crypto Winter. If we are in a bear market, then it follows that we need to screen for well-funded projects that have staying power. NEAR Protocol (NEAR-USD) is a top funded project that scores highly on my Ratings Scorecard. Yet the coin trades relatively cheaply perhaps due to market inefficiencies. Most L1 projects seem to have similar use cases and designs. However, I think NEAR has a ""special sauce"" that will help transition corporations and Web2 companies into Web3. This ""special sauce"" is called BOS for short - meaning blockchain operating system. BOS combines all the advantages of Web3 to those incumbent firms while ridding the issues of both Web2 and Web3. BOS provides organizations the tools that allow killer Dapps to be easily created. While it was only recently introduced, there's evidence showing rising activity related to this software stack. Introduction Bitcoin (BTC-USD) remains in a bear market in my opinion. Patience is a virtue - we must wait for apathy to become the narrative before a true market bottom is reached. For now, I see a host of negatives including weak seasonality, competition from governmental CBDCs, rising Bitcoin Dominance, distribution by larger holders, greedy sentiment, tightening Fed liquidity and negative On-Chain Metrics. Remember, moves in cryptocurrency prices are intractably tied to moves in Bitcoin prices. Well, that's my two Satoshis! Winner Take All? I'm a firm believer of the Pareto Principle, meaning that 80% of Layer 1 transactions will be controlled by 20% of players. My guess is that Ethereum will remain the gorilla, the rest will be shared amongst a handful of chains specializing in certain niches. Maybe Algorand for governments/institutions (e.g., CBDCs) Hedera for corporations, Avalanche for gaming, Cosmos for ""make your own meme-coin"" and Solana (SOL-USD) for NFTs. I think NEAR Protocol has a fair chance of becoming the operating system as the Internet transitions to Web3 . Web3 has tons of VC-funded greenfield innovation, so why not follow the money? Web3 Advantages vs. Web2 Can you do me a favor? Next time someone condescendingly tells you ""crypto has no use case"", hand them this laundry list: Decentralization: there is no single central authority controlling the data, enhancing security and transparency. Data Ownership and Privacy: allows users to have greater control over their data. They can own their data and choose who gets access to it, reducing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized usage. Censorship Resistance: ensuring freedom of speech. Interoperability: enabling seamless communication and data exchange between different applications. Smart Contracts: allows self-executing contracts with predefined rules and conditions. Tokenization: enables the creation of digital assets through tokenization of real-world assets ((RWA)). Immutable Records and Auditability. Reduced Middlemen: leads to lower fees, faster transactions, and increased financial inclusion. By the way, 1.7B people are considered unbanked. Hard to believe, no?! Community Governance ((DAO)) thus allowing users to participate in decision-making. Incentives for Participation: via staking, governance rights, etc. Ratings Scorecard NEAR Protocol is amongst the highest-rated project within my scorecard - factors are summarized below: Funding: Excellent . One of the highest-funded of all projects. On 10/2021, announced one of the largest grants ever ($800MM ) for ecosystem development. Treasury is $900MM (excluding the grant) and its management will be fully decentralized via community DAOs. Management team: Excellent . NEAR Protocol is the product of two brilliant minds: Alexander Skidanov and Illia Polosukhin . Illia's a buff dude - think of Vitalik Buterin on steroids. The team includes several International Collegiate Programming Contest medalists and finalists. Technology: Excellent. Most digital asset rating services (e.g., TokenInsigh t) rate NEAR's technology high including its Dynamic Sharding and ability to include zero knowledge/private shards on the chain. Ambitious road-map. Developers: Above-Average . Rapid developer growth over the last two years, though down from 2022. Its programming language Rust is considered the "" most beloved language "" by coders. Electric Capital User Experience (U/X): Average . User experience is a mission of the team and its Blockchain operating system ((BOS)) will go a long way to achieving that. Use Case: Above-Average : While there's been a large decline in Total Value Locked since 2022, the BOS operating system (i.e., Web2 to Web3) is expected to breathe new life into the project. The network's value is aided by its Aurora, Octopus Network and Rainbow Bridge which facilitate interoperability. Defi Llama Ecosystem : Below-Average: Minimal Dapp diversity ( see gray bar in chart below ). Failure to generate any hype. Sunsetting of the algorithmic USN stablecoin. Leading Dapp: Sweat Economy. Not a leader in Defi applications or NFTs ( see NFT Activity chart below ). Messari Messari Decentralization: Below-Average : NEAR has just 215 Validators (7/2023) and a Nakamoto Coefficient of 8, both are lower than other L1s. Though, the team is aware of the issue and has set up an onboarding program as well as tech-upgrade (""Nightshade Sharding""). Staking percentage is low ( 47% ). (See peer table below.) Pontem Network Tokenomics: Above-Average : Genesis Supply (no Max): 1Bn NEAR coins, Total Supply: 1.15Bn, Circulating Supply: 82%. Inflation , at 5% (according to a schedule) may decline due to transaction fees that are burned. High percentage of Insiders. Vesting schedule was initially steep, but sharply improved; we are at month 36 in the schedule below. Solana Foundation Social: Excellent . High social engagement. Around 1.9 million (though below their 2.2 million goal) Twitter followers, 46k Telegram followers and 210k CoinMarketCap watchlists. Oddly, just 370 Seeking Alpha users follow NEAR. Onboarding the next billion users I've been doing deep-dives into blockchains for years and have to admit these narratives are starting to get old. I can't tell you how many times I've read about a ""unique"" L1 protocol that has a proof of stake consensus, a native token, a permissionless layer, staking and validators that can be slashed, that's fast, and has 1000 Dapps in its ecosystem. However, in reality, the ecosystems are supported by just a handful of Dapps. Having a DEX that allows for trading of tokens back-and-forth amongst Degens doesn't sound like a real use case to me. We desperately need a killer app (a version of Facebook, TikTok, Grand Theft Auto) that'll onboard the next billion users. After having stared at TVL (Total Value Locked) and transaction data for years, I'm still waiting. Nothing's grown, in fact TVL has plunged since peaking in 2022. What businesses need is someone that will handhold them, helping cross that chasm from the Internet to Web3. This is a scary, time-consuming process for anyone, especially for a traditional company that already has a cash cow from its existing business and feels comfortable dealing with other centralized and regulated businesses like itself. NEAR is the ""BOS"" NEAR Protocol (Mainnet 4/2020) while being similar in some respects to other L1s, does have a bent towards Artificial Intelligence ((AI)) as it was originally conceived as a machine-learning platform. Once investors realize that NEAR too, has the bright, shiny object of AI, the coin could pump. But I'm not here for that. Instead, I believe NEAR's real long-term value will come from its Blockchain Operating System ((BOS)). Think of it like the ones we're familiar with from the Magnificent 7 of AI: Android, Windows, IOS and Chrome OS. An operating system is a vital piece of software that acts as a middleman between hardware and software applications, thus allowing a layman like myself the ability to use it effectively without banging my head against the wall. The global OS market (excluding servers) is valued at $45Bn as of 2022. In the same manner that OS systems act as an intermediary, NEAR's BOS will try to solve problems associated transitioning into Web3 by acting as an intermediary ( see chart below for details ). Near Foundation The awesome benefits to society from a decentralized technology like blockchain can also hinder incumbents from embracing it. For example, anyone that's done a ""deep dive"" into blockchain projects can be overwhelmed by the abundance of software programming languages, network architectures, poor user experiences (""U/X"") and compossibility issues (i.e., porting applications). Despite being around nearly a decade, these issues have kept crypto from having many killer apps. NEAR Protocol introduced BOS on 3/2023. BOS, which is open-source, effectively allows developers the ability to build on any blockchain using their favorite language. BOS (acting as middleman) provides users the ability to easily connect (and onboard) with many applications without the requirement of owning crypto. BOS, as an interoperable platform, addresses both the weaknesses of Web2 (such as data ownership) and the weaknesses of Web3 (such as fragmentation, technical user experience) while accessing their strengths (e.g., a composable front-end). This is a difficult concept for me to explain, so I used the analogy of an operating system. In reality, NEAR's BOS is far more - it's a software stack that provides a collection of independent components that allow all of this to happen smoothly. Kind of like how sausage is made. For simplicity's sake, I've excluded much of the technical jargon including the key features of BOS such as FastAuth, Developer Enablement, Universal Search, Gateways, Content Moderation and NEAR Tasks. For example, FastAuth (going live 9/2023) will allow mobile users to easily generate a private key for Web3 Dapps using their email and biometrics or PIN. Please see this video from the NEAR Foundation for details. Adoption Metrics for BOS I accessed several third-party analytics sites (e.g., Token Terminal, Artemis) as well as NEAR's explorer and have found weak evidence of growth in NEAR's blockchain since BOS's introduction. Perhaps it's too early? However, there's evidence that developers are ramping up widgets related to BOS. You can think of a widget as a small piece of a web page, or Dapp, that is reusable, configurable, and embeddable. ( See chart below ). Messari, Near Foundation Valuation There are several ways you can value crypto projects including: number of active addresses, daily transactions, price/revenue and price/TVL. However, I believe it's too early to use these metrics as crypto projects are analogous to venture capital portfolio companies which have minimal revenue bases. Also, not all of NEAR's TVL is captured using Defi Llama and Token Terminal. For now, Price/Book Value may be the most appropriate metric and NEAR scores well here. In calculating Price/Book, I assume that NEAR Foundation custodies all its treasury and that the treasury amount equates to book value (i.e., a debt-free organization). I calculated a Price/Book Value of 1.6x , which is 50% cheaper than other blockchain projects and 60% cheaper than the S&P 500's ratio. The beauty of NEAR's treasury , is that unlike most projects, NEAR keeps a large portion invested in securities other than its native coin. So when the price of NEAR declines, the Price/Book also declines . Get it? Near Foundation Technical Analysis of NEAR's chart I believe the cryptocurrency space is inefficient (asset prices do not accurately reflect fundamentals). Once you've done the hard work of finding a good project, technical analysis can be used as a timing tool. I tend to favor traditional charts (e.g., Cup & Handle) and long areas of basing. As they say, ""the longer the base, the more it'll rocket into space."" NEAR's been basing all year and it's finally showing some relative strength as can be seen in the NEAR-BTC chart below. This is not financial advice, but if NEAR holds at $1 during another bear low, that would be very bullish. TradingView Idiosyncratic Risks ""NEAR: we have no marketing team"". The joke amongst Crypto Degens is that if only NEAR had a marketing team. That is their only real weakness. A project built by engineers for engineers isn't the best recipe for generating hype. Companies that are successfully run by their engineer/technical founders are a rare breed. Tesla's Elon Musk, for example, is known for brainstorming with his engineering teams as well as wearing the CEO hat. Though, I hear he can be a real jerk to work for. Nonetheless, NEAR's team needs to transition its leadership towards someone that speaks the language of business. Else, it will not be successful. Systemic Risks Intense competition amongst other Layer 1s and Layer 2s (e.g., Polygon, Optimism). Regulatory: The SEC under Gary Gensler has conducted what I would call ""regulation by enforcement."" NEAR was listed in the SEC's lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase. Crypto-related crime grew to $20Bn (2022) in illicit on-chain transactions (40% sanctions related). Hacking accounted for $3.8Bn stolen. (Source: 2022 Crypto Crime Report (Chainalysis). NEAR Protocol vs. Solana Given that I penned an SA article on Solana, a project whose life has been anything but a beach, I thought I'd quickly compare the two. Solana's OG, Anatoly Yakovenko, once said he would've used NEAR's superior sharding technology, however, he considered it ""too complex and didn't have the patience for it."" Both Solana and NEAR are based out of San Francisco and I consider them amongst the highest-rated L1s. Both Solana and NEAR flew too close to blockchain blowups, with Solana having a near-death experience thanks to FTX and NEAR suffering from its involvement in Terra (LUNA-USD) and Three Arrows Capital. I would classify NEAR as riskier given that it's less battle-tested, smaller, has less activity, is relatively centralized, isn't well known and has a more complex design (Modular vs Solana's Monolithic). Why we cheer for NEAR NEAR-USD is one of a few coins that may pump again during the next bull run. The well-funded project lacks hype and hasn't had a killer Dapp yet. However, its new operating system sets the stage for strong user adoption as it helps companies transitioning into Web3. The future's NEAR - this project could become BOS . `",POSITIVE,SOL | NEAR,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | SOL | TRADING | NEAR,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4621944-future-is-near-this-project-could-become-bos?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/15503074.jpeg

As this event drew closer, crypto investors began filling up their LTC bags in preparation for what is expected to be a very bullish event. And now, with less than two days left to go before the halving, sharks have made remarkable moves to position themselves for possible upside. Litecoin Sharks Load Up Their Bags A report shared by the on-chain tracking platform Santiment revealed how Litecoin investors are currently looking at the digital asset. The chart showed an impressive accumulation trend from dolphin and shark wallets, which have increased their holdings significantly in the last month. Related Reading: Dogecoin Falls While Others Rally, Is It Decoupling From The Market? Santiment’s report shows that these wallets holding between $9,500 and $950,000 worth of LTC have added over 200,00 coins to their balances since June 14. On this date, the total holdings of these wallets were sitting just slightly below 18 million. However, in the next two weeks, their balances grew above 18.1 million coins. LTC sharks and dolphins buy over 200,000 coins | Source: Santiment There has also been a semi-constant uptrend among these investors. Although there were dips here and there in their holdings, they remained committed to the accumulation over this last two weeks, each time buying more coins than they sold. What Is Driving The LTC Accumulation? The current accumulation from the dolphin and shark wallets are not isolated and just like the whale acquisitions, they are being driven by the same thing. The Litecoin halving is expected to take place on Wednesday and since this event has been historically bullish, it has triggered active participation from investors looking to capitalize on it. If the LTC halving plays out as expected, then it is possible that the price of the altcoin will climb above $100 once more. This would put the majority of the LTC accumulated by the dolphin and shark addresses over the last two weeks back in profit territory. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Price Remains Muted Despite Significant Milestones, Why? However, the days leading up to the event haven’t been as bullish as expected. Even though LTC’s price is still trading above $90, it has seen only single-digit daily gains over this time. Naturally, with less than two days to go, there should have already been some rapid increases for the cryptocurrency but there has been none. This current trend suggests that the halving may already be priced into LTC’s price, especially given the fact that the crypto bear market has continued. At the time of writing, LTC is changing hands at a price of $93.80, down 0.98%, according to data from Coinmarketcap.

The new collection offers an expanded list of digital and real-world rewards, including a 12-month Etihad Guest Silver Tier Status, priority check-in, a 25% boost when earning Etihad Guest Miles, lounge access at Abu Dhabi International airport, membership to the Etihad: Virtual Club, a fast-track to go from Silver to Gold Tier status and a customized Etihad membership card.  In September, Etihad plans to launch its Web3 loyalty program called ""Horizon Club"" and will introduce a staking-for-miles program that will allow the community to lock up their NFTs to earn Etihad Guest Miles. Miles earned can then be redeemed for flights, upgrades and other perks.  The new NFTs were created in collaboration with real-world asset tokenization firm Arcube, which has signed on as Etihad Airways official Web3 partner. Infrastructure firm Crossmint is facilitating cryptocurrency or credit card payments.  As Web3 loyalty programs gain popularity, Etihad is the latest airline to expand its blockchain-based offerings. Low-cost Argentinian carrier Flybondi in March expanded its partnership with NFT ticketing company TravelX to offer all tickets as NFTs on the Algorand blockchain. TravelX previously partnered with Spanish airline Air Europa in April 2022 to launch a series of NFT tickets linked to perks and events.

Bitcoin (BTC), the top cryptocurrency by market value, slipped 1.2% to $28,890, leading the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) to a 1.7% decline.  Curve's native token CRV is down 4% over the past 24 hours to $0.59, but earlier Thursday had slid to as low at $0.50 before Tron blockchain founder Justin Sun purchased more than $2 million worth of the token and pledged additional assistance through a liquidity pool set up on the Tron network.

15500984,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545256,1690841165,29 Other Meme Coins Besides BALD Rugged on Base,"Scope data on July 31 shows that 29 meme coins were launched over the weekend on Base to capitalize on the recent frenzy surrounding BaldBaseBald (BALD), a meme coin inspired by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. However, all 29 meme coins have since been rugged, with the deployer exiting with over $1 million after seeding roughly $105,000 of ETH as liquidity. Base is an Ethereum layer-2 platform based on Optimism roll-up technology. Rug Pulls On Base On July 29 and 30, there was excitement about the meme coin, BALD, as its prices exploded by as much as 4,000X, pushing the token’s market cap to over $100 million. This was great news for those who invested early as some exited as the wave rise, profiting. Some builders took advantage of the hype and created meme coins to deceive investors eager to join the BALD trend, eventually resulting in losses for some meme coin token holders. Related Reading: BALD Coin Rug Pull: How A $100 Million Memecoin Became Worthless Overnight While BALD has already been rug-pulled, Scope notes that the address behind the 29 meme coins also has a history of rug-pulling in other platforms, including the BNB Chain and Arbitrum, a popular Ethereum layer-2 platform. In platforms where meme coins are traded, liquidity, provided by the community, is essential due to the decentralized nature of trading. Rug pullers typically supply liquidity to their meme coins, which attracts more users to buy the coin and increases liquidity as prices rise. However, the creator then deliberately withdraws liquidity at this point, converting their meme coins to a more liquid coin like Ethereum, causing their token prices to drop to zero. As of July 31, hours after the rug pull, the address primarily held USDC and a small portion of ETH in their portfolio, with no meme coins. This potentially highlights the rug puller’s risk-averseness and his concerns about the risks involved in this asset class. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crucial Moment: Will Resistance At $29,500 Trigger A Sell-Off Or Surge? Meme Coins Are Volatile Meme coins are popular in crypto, especially Ethereum, where they are minted as fungible ERC-20 tokens in their trillions. Dogecoin, endorsed by Elon Musk, is the most liquid and widely recognized. Despite rising popularity, there are concerns about their volatility and lack of utility, with some critics labeling them as “casinos” that undermine the true vision of crypto as an alternative financial system. For example, the collapse of BALD, which commanded billions in market cap on Base over the weekend, has drawn widespread condemnation. Besides BALD, other like PEPE and LADYS are struggling, dropping by over 70% from their all-time peaks registered in H1 2023.

The capital will help the startup expand its team and continue working on the technological development of its platform.  Other investors in the round included UOB Venture Management, Mirana Ventures, Emirates Consortium, Matrix Partners, Apollo Capital, HashCIB, Geek Cartel, Bing Ventures and Bytetrade Labs.  ""Solv has built a trustless institutional DeFi platform integrating brokers, underwriters, market makers, and custodians to create the first fund infrastructure on the blockchain to bridge DeFi, CeFi and TradFi liquidity,” said Olivier Dang, general partner and head of ventures at Laser Digital, in a press release.  Solv offers decentralized liquidity infrastructure that allows organizations to raise money through the creation, usage and sale of financial products. The Solv process begins with an onboarding process for crypto-native market makers, venture capitalists and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) interested in using the platform. Approved users can then create financial products that are wrapped in semi-fungible tokens (SFT). The SFT is distributed through the Solv platform or an underwriter in order to receive liquidity from interested buyers or investors.

The rule also holds true for investors staking tokens through a crypto exchange, according to the agency, if “the taxpayer receives additional units of cryptocurrency as rewards as a result of the validation.”  The IRS legal guidance comes as other federal and state regulators – especially the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) – have gone after staking services from crypto exchanges as illegally offered securities. Kraken, for instance, settled accusations from the SEC by shutting down its staking platform in February. More recently, the agency said Binance’s staking service violates securities law.

42419850,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUG7jx,1690839890,"Curve Founder’s $168M Stash Is Under Stress, Creating a Risk for DeFi as a Whole","The exploit at DeFi giant Curve Finance has driven down the price of its CRV token, putting an $168 million stash of founder Michael Egorov's money at risk of being liquidated.  That could create pressure in the DeFi ecosystem, as seized assets would have to be sold – into a market where prices are already falling.  Chaos at Curve Finance has put a $168 million lending position held by founder Michael Egorov at greater risk of liquidation, an event that – if it happens – could have giant implications across decentralized finance (DeFi).  Egorov has $168 million of CRV, Curve’s native token, securing loans from multiple DeFi protocols, data on blockchain analytics site DeBank shows. That equals almost 34% of the token’s total market capitalization.  Read more: Crisis at DeFi Giant Curve Eases After Justin Sun and Others Step In With Help  Following an exploit over the weekend at Curve, CRV’s price has sunk more than 20%, putting Egorov closer to levels where he’d get liquidated.  A forced liquidation would be another serious blow to Curve, a key piece of infrastructure in the DeFi economy, after the protocol suffered the major exploit that siphoned some $70 million of assets away from users. The total value of assets locked on Curve dropped to $2.1 billion from $3.7 billion as many investors withdrew funds as a precaution.  Given the interconnected nature of DeFi, if Egorov's position is liquidated that could put pressure on other decentralized lending protocols as well as CRV's price. CRV itself could be described as a systemically important asset that is used as a trading pair and ballast in trading pools across DeFi, including on popular platforms like Sushi and Uniswap. It is a popular form of collateral on loan-making platform Aave.  Egorov locked up some $168 million in CRV tokens on Aave to take out a $63 million loan in Tether’s USDT stablecoin. According to DefiLlama, the level Egorov’s CRV collateral gets liquidated is 37 cents; CRV currently trades for around 55 cents.  Egorov also borrowed $17 million of the FRAX stablecoin using $32 million of CRV as collateral on stablecoin issuer Fraxlend. In the past few hours, Egorov has made several transactions to repay some of the capital he borrowed on Fraxlend, per DeBank. He also has a $18 million loan on decentralized platform Abracadabra.  Egorov has been shoring up capital this afternoon by selling LDO – the governance token for liquid staking leader Lido – for Circle’s USDC stablecoin in several batches between $10,000 and $50,000, according to Etherscan.  Whether or not Egorov’s CRV borrow position is liquidated, the situation has already raised questions in crypto investing circles around how a single person was able to lend so much of a “blue chip” crypto token’s supply.  Read more: Curve Finance CEO Egorov Sued by 3 DeFi-Focused Venture Capital Firms  It’s also raised questions for decentralized lending protocols like Aave, and whether they should implement safeguards to limit large positions like Egorov’s that have the potential to introduce systemic risk.  According to data from Coinglass, CRV has had $3.03 million in total liquidations in the past 24 hours, trailing behind BTC and ETH.  CRV was launched without a premine (aka tokens set aside for founders and employees) and initially set to be distributed primarily to liquidity providers on the platform.  Egorov was widely criticized in 2020 after taking control of more than two-thirds of a separate Curve voting token called veCRV, used to vote on and submit proposals on CurveDAO. He later apologized for the move, explaining that it was an ""overreaction"" towards what looked like a takeover attempt from rival platform Yearn.Finance.  Gauntlet, a risk management firm that caught sight of Egorov's massive CRV loans on Aave as early as January, recommended at the time to freeze the CRV market on Aave V2 to mitigate the chances of a meltdown happening like it did on Monday. There are indications that Egorov actively managed his sizable position in the past, including at times paying down portions of the debt.

42419851,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUG7kz,1690838033,Judge Rejects Ripple Ruling Precedent in Denying Terraform Labs' Motion to Dismiss SEC Lawsuit,"A federal judge denied Terraform Labs' motion to dismiss an SEC lawsuit.  The judge also said he rejected the use of a ruling from another judge who ruled that Ripple did not violate securities law in selling XRP to retail investors through an exchange intermediary.  A federal judge denied stablecoin issuer Terraform Labs' motion to dismiss a lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday, saying the regulatory agency has sufficiently argued it has jurisdiction and ""asserted a plausible claim"" that TerraUSD (UST), the Anchor Protocol and LUNA may have violated securities law.  More importantly, perhaps, Judge Jed Rakoff, of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, also rejected the use of a ruling from fellow Judge Analisa Torres, who recently ruled that Ripple Labs – another defendant against the SEC – did not violate securities law in making XRP available on secondary platforms for retail investors to purchase.  The SEC sued Terraform and founder Do Kwon earlier this year on charges of misleading investors about UST, a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar through the LUNA token, and fraud.  In a motion to dismiss, Terraform argued that people bought UST for practical purposes and did not have an expectation of it being an investment. Earlier this month, attorneys for Terraform also pointed to the recent Ripple ruling, in which Judge Torres said that while Ripple had violated securities laws in selling XRP to institutional investors, retail investors could not have known they were purchasing XRP from Ripple because they bought the token on intermediary exchanges through Ripple's programmatic sales.  In his order Monday, Judge Rakoff said he rejected that approach.  ""Whatever expectation of profit they had could not, according to that court, be ascribed to defendants’ efforts,"" he wrote. ""But Howey makes no such distinction between purchasers. And it makes good sense that it did not. That a purchaser bought the coins directly from the defendants or, instead, in a secondary resale transaction has no impact on whether a reasonable individual would objectively view the defendants’ actions and statements as evincing a promise of profits based on their efforts.""  The SEC has already hinted that it may appeal the ruling.  During the motion to dismiss stage, the facts in the SEC's complaint must be assumed to be true, he noted, and the SEC said in its filing that Terraform had ""embarked on a public campaign to encourage both retail and institutional investors"" to buy UST.  The judge also rejected Terraform Labs' ""major questions doctrine"" objection. The doctrine stems from a Supreme Court ruling which functionally blocks regulatory agencies from dramatically exceeding their mandate, and is an argument a number of crypto defendants have invoked against the SEC, including crypto exchange Coinbase.  ""As the doctrine’s name suggests and the Supreme Court has, in case after case, emphasized, the Major Questions Doctrine is intended to apply only in extraordinary circumstances involving industries of 'vast economic and political significance,'"" he wrote. ""This question, moreover, of whether an industry subject to regulation is of 'vast economic and political significance' should not be resolved in a vacuum. Rather, an industry can be considered to have 'vast economic and political significance' only if it resembles, in these two qualities, the industries that the Supreme Court has previously said meet this definition.""  The cryptocurrency industry ""falls far short"" of this standard, he wrote.  The price of XRP fell around 2% after the ruling was published, dropping as low as $0.69 after reaching an intraday high of $0.72. It was trading around $0.70 as of press time.

Presidential candidate and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.) called out the Biden Administration for its “war” on bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies and vowed to end it should he become President.  “Biden's war on bitcoin and cryptocurrency will come to an end when I am president,” he said at a Monday campaign event in New Hampshire. “We are going to allow Americans to invest in things like bitcoin and cryptocurrency.

42419868,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUG7uH,1690833720,"As Litecoin Halving Approaches, Founder Touts Silver Collector Cards Loaded With 'Digital Silver'","Litecoin Foundation and crypto cold-storage card manufacturer Ballet teased an upcoming sale of 500 collectable cards – fashioned from 50 grams of fine silver and pre-loaded with at least 6.25 litecoin (LTC).  The cards will commemorate the blockchain’s third halving event, expected to happen on Wednesday.  The sale is expected to take place sometime later in the month, with each card commanding a price of approximately $1,000 – but with a tangible value estimated at around $621.  Litecoin is sometimes referred to as the “digital silver” to bitcoin’s reputation as “digital gold.”  That reference appears to be the basis for a new crypto promotion by Litecoin creator Charlie Lee and his brother Bobby Lee, aiming to capitalize on a sudden surge in interest in the project, thanks to a quadrennial event in the blockchain’s lifecycle known as a “halving,” happening this week.  Bobby Lee is CEO and co-founder of Ballet, a manufacturer of special cards used for “cold storage” or holding crypto offline. And he’s teamed up with his younger brother Charlie Lee, executive director of the Litecoin Foundation, to commemorate the blockchain’s third halving by creating 500 collectible cards made of 99.9% pure silver.  The cards themselves – the silver alone – could carry a value of roughly $40 a card, but they would also be loaded with 6.25 LTC, or $581 worth. They are expected to be sold for about $1,000, which means the premium would roughly represent intangible value to buyers. All proceeds from the sale will be donated to the Litecoin Foundation to further the blockchain’s adoption and development, according to Charlie Lee.  The brothers made the announcement during a Twitter livestream, one week before Litecoin’s expected Aug. 2 halving event.  The litecoin cryptocurrency was created in 2011 as a “fork” or clone of the Bitcoin blockchain, and much like its ancestor, the Litecoin network rewards miners with a predetermined number of coins for successfully mining a block of transactions. That reward (called a “subsidy”) is halved every 840,000 blocks (roughly every four years). The third halving takes place on Wednesday and reduces the current 12.5 litecoin (LTC) subsidy to 6.25 LTC. The original subsidy was 50 LTC.  (Bitcoin, the original blockchain, launched in 2009, and is expected to undergo its fourth halving sometime next year. The halvings are programmed to happen every 210,000 blocks or roughly every four years).  At some point after the halving event, Charlie Lee will pay at least 6.25 LTC to reimburse miners from one of the oldest and largest Litecoin mining pools, Litecoinpool, who have agreed to send their block subsidies – which will also be 6.25 LTC by then – directly to the blockchain addresses associated with the silver cards, all made of 50 grams of 99.9% pure silver (also known as “999 fine silver”).  This means the cards will be worth at least 6.25 LTC plus the market value of 50 grams of silver which is hovering at just under 80 cents per gram (about $40 per card) at the time of publication.  “It's on a silver card,” Charlie Lee explained. “So even if litecoin goes to zero, it will still be worth the price of silver.”  Read more: Litecoin Is 'Halving' Soon: What's Happening and What You Should Know  Bobby Lee said the collectibles are about the size of a credit card and have a double-layered QR code sticker displaying a litecoin deposit address on the top layer and an encrypted private key (EPK) on the concealed bottom layer. A passphrase to decrypt the private key can be accessed by scratching off a second section located just below the QR code.  The passphrase and EPK can then be submitted to Ballet’s mobile app to decrypt the private key via a bitcoin improvement proposal (BIP) 38 algorithm, according to Bobby Lee.  “This is the magic of the BIP38 industry standard,” Bobby Lee said. “This was invented by Michael Caldwell, the creator of the Casascius coin, 10 years ago.”  The Litecoin commemorative cards go on sale sometime in August after the halving event and will cost about $1,000.  “It'll be about $1,000,” the Litecoin inventor said. “We might have a few that we auction, like the first 20, 21 or something. We'll sell the rest at a fixed price,” he added. “Maybe I'll sign a few of them. We haven't decided yet.”  At the time of reporting, LTC had appreciated slightly to $92.43 from $91.20 since the brothers’ livestream.",POSITIVE,LTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | LTC | MINING | TRADING,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/07/31/as-litecoin-halving-approaches-founder-touts-silver-collector-cards-loaded-with-digital-silver,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4b4b863cd8e81f48de9bea567b2492a135604dd5-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

15497960,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545248,1690833657,BALD Coin Rug Pull: How A $100 Million Memecoin Became Worthless Overnight,"On July 30, a meme coin called BaldBaseBald (BALD) launched on Base Network, Coinbase’s new Layer 2 built on Optimism. The coin referenced Brian Armstrong, Coinbase’s “bald” founder, and quickly became a coordination point for speculators on the frontier chain. Within two days, the token had reached a market cap of $100 million, with over $25 million in liquidity. However, the token’s meteoric rise turned out to be a classic case of market manipulation, as the deployer behind the token, BaldBaseBald, rug pulled the token and caused its price to plummet by 85%. Malicious Market Behavior Behind BALD? Market researcher Thiccy indexed all the transactions from the Bald deployer and uncovered a story of malicious market behavior. BaldBaseBald added over 6,700 ETH, or over $12.5 million worth of liquidity, to the pool in the first 24 hours, a surprising amount of capital for a meme coin on a new chain. Related Reading: Breaking: HEX Token Plummets 25% Following SEC Lawsuit Against Founder Richard Heart The deployer’s actions were undoubtedly bullish for speculators, and many people speculated that Brian Armstrong had created the coin to drum up hype. However, as soon as the deployer stopped adding liquidity to the pool, the price stagnated and broke down. 24 hours later, the deployer started bidding on BALD again, causing the price to double. Then, the deployer withdrew over 10.500 Ethereum (ETH), or almost $20 million worth of liquidity, leading to an 85% drop in the token’s value. Thiccy’s analysis showed that the deployer had made a net profit of 2,789 ETH, or 5.2 million dollars, after adding 6,870 ETH, spending 1,360 ETH buying at an average price of 0.0004, and withdrawing 10,704 ETH. It was surprising how well-capitalized the actor was and how bold they were in carrying out this apparent manipulative market behavior in the middle of the public light on Coinbase’s compliance chain. Thiccy Concluded: And with that, the story of BALD has come to a close play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Hopefully we can learn from this as a space this market is rife with market manipulation and unethical shills. Be careful who you trust. Thiccy advises investors to control their Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) and not risk more than they can afford to lose, as survival is too important in this game.

42392842,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgCc0B,1690833209,Bitcoin Taught Me a Valuable Lesson at Austin’s Airport,"It’s only now, more than two months after Consensus 2023, that I’m able to write about the embarrassing things I experienced at the big tent crypto gathering. I escaped from both incidents without undue pain or loss – and there’s a silver lining. Both made me think hard about why I have stuck around as long as I have in the blockchain industry.  The principle of transacting with minimal information is an important one and (spoiler alert) it doesn’t happen because you used a blockchain.  Galen Moore is the global communications lead at Axelar.  Embarrassing experience #1: Accidentally interviewing a Fortune 500 CEO  My first embarrassment was on CoinDesk TV, where the handsome George Kaloudis and I had the pleasure of interviewing Franklin Templeton CEO Jenny Johnson. This was unexpected: I had no idea $BEN was active in cryptocurrency.  Even more unexpected was what Johnson said in the interview. She opened by saying bitcoin is a “distraction” from the “greatest disruption,” blockchain.  Of course, I disagree. Because bitcoin exists, I can transact globally with anyone over the internet, exchanging a minimal amount of information – just as laid out by the cypherpunks when they first questioned the commercial direction of the internet in 1993.  That’s not due to blockchain, the database technology. It’s due to bitcoin, the currency, providing economic incentives that support Bitcoin, the network, keeping my transactions secure and information-minimized.  Of course, I didn’t say any of this to Johnson. I’ve been in this industry long enough to know when not to red-pill someone.  But a couple days later, traversing security at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport, I found myself “living the questions,” as the poet Rainer Maria Rilke advised. I experienced a minimal-information transaction first-hand, in a way that had nothing to do with bitcoin – and everything to do with bad decisions I made while in Austin, Texas.  Embarrassing experience #2: A special search at the airport  On the last night of Consensus, Axelar hosted a party with Dragonfly Capital. Like all the best side events, it was cozy and the crowd was hand-picked. I met several really smart people. But it was the last night of Consensus, and I was tired. I made my excuses to my co-hosts, and left a little early to watch the Golden State Warriors game.  Sitting at a nearby bar, I started chatting with two women who had secured babysitters and were out for a night on the town. The rest of the night is a bit of a blur. I remember we went to another bar and played darts; I gave my state-issued ID to the bartender as security for the darts.  The night wound on from there through various bars, cars and apartments in the city of Austin. So much for being tired.  See also: Austin: Where Remote-Work Crypto Developers Actually Like Living | Crypto Hubs 2023  I arrived at the airport at 6 A.M. I got into a very short security line and reached for my wallet – and with startling clarity, I remembered the darts. I had left my ID with that bartender, and I had no idea whether I was going to make my plane due to depart in an hour and a half.  How to go through airport security, with minimal information  At Axelar, we sometimes compare our project to an international air-cargo network. Each blockchain is a sovereign country: some connections require only a bridge and a checkpoint while more sophisticated commerce is transacted via airports, air-traffic control systems and customs inspectors.  You don’t have to prove who you are to go through the customs equivalent (validators) on a decentralized cross-chain connector like Axelar. Could there be a way for me to get on a plane similarly, without proving my identity? It turned out, there was.  After about 20 minutes, two new uniformed Transportation Security Administration (TSA) personnel arrived. These two men seemed different from the usual TSA employee. They carried themselves like military officers.  They reviewed what I had in my wallet: a library card, a health-insurance card and a couple of credit cards. They ran my carry-ons through the X-Ray machine and subjected them to an enhanced “swab test,” opening each bag and taking thorough samples inside and out for spectrographic analysis.  Start to finish, it took about 10 minutes to determine I wasn’t any threat. (I won’t offer details, but they weren’t swabbing for Schedule-1 substances, or I’d still be in Texas.) The process was relatively inefficient and my bags were open to scrutiny. It was … a lot like transacting over a public blockchain – that is, one where honest authentication is enforced by economic incentives using a cryptocurrency like bitcoin.  Bitcoin is the ‘swab test’  Until Bitcoin, there was no way to send money over the internet without a bank in between, to permit the transaction. Now, with Ethereum, we can send any payload over a similarly decentralized global network. We can even build super apps that compute permissionlessly cross-chain between Ethereum, Cosmos and related networks.  See also: Cosmos Blockchain Project Faces 'Existential' Crisis  That’s not because of the “underlying technology” of blockchain. It’s because of the way assets like BTC, ETH and AXL incentivize decentralized validation through mining and staking.  It’s cumbersome and, yeah, often it’s distracting. Using the decentralized web means I have to submit my transaction to a security swab test by an open network of validators. And the question remains: why opt for that when trusted institutions are available?  There are clear answers to that question today, beginning with repressive regimes and currency crises, and extending through any digital transaction where minimal information exchange is desired.  Has the hype surpassed those use cases, to the point where it becomes a distraction? Almost certainly, it has. But for those of us who believe the internet is young, and that this ability to transact with minimal information will be an important part, it seems worth working on for the longterm.

The recent move above $29,500 has provided some hope for the bulls, but so far, they have been unable to gather enough momentum to push prices higher. Bitcoin Struggles To Break Above Key Moving Average According to Material Indicators, a leading market analysis firm, the key to a bullish breakout in the BTC market is for the coin to print candles above the 100-week moving average (MA). However, BTC has yet to test this level, and bulls have struggled to maintain the current range. The 50-day MA has been a crucial support level, with BTC testing it for today’s eighth consecutive day. While the 50-day MA has managed to hold, resistance at $29,500 has been replenishing, posing a challenge for the bulls. If they cannot clear this level, Material Indicators expects a run at the lows with $28,300 as the last line of defense. The big question for BTC investors is whether the coin will bounce from the $28,000 zone or extend to $25,000 and beyond. All of these moves are possible, but the mystery lies in what order and timeline they will play out.

Traders and investors closely monitor the price action and indicators to prepare for potential moves. BTC’s Store Of Value Narrative Solidified The recent changes in the structure of Bitcoin’s trading volume have sparked a debate among cryptocurrency investors and traders. According to Crypto Quant, since January 2023, the Spot vs. Derivatives volume ratio has dropped from 35% to 6%, resulting in a new era of low volatility in the cryptocurrency market. This decrease in spot volume means that investors are holding onto their Bitcoins instead of selling them, as Bitcoin is now considered a valuable asset, similar to digital gold. This is seen in the BTC: Binary Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) chart, which shows that since the start of the year, there have been no active sales among the cohort of long-term holders (LTHs). Moreover, the total Simple Moving Average (SMA)-7d weekly trading volume of Bitcoin across all exchanges has dropped from 2.5 million BTC in March to less than 600 thousand BTC in July, representing a more than 75% reduction over the specified period. While some may see this trend as a crisis, Crypto Quant believes it is a sign of the cryptocurrency market maturing and becoming more stable and predictable. However, this trend could lead to significant changes in the Bitcoin market. A reduction in spot volume may result in a reduction in liquidity, which could increase the demand and price of Bitcoin. The market currently lacks a new wave of optimism, and the question is, where will it come from? Related Reading: US Presidential Candidate Defends Bitcoin, Calls Out Environmental Critics The answer may lie in the growing institutional interest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Several major financial institutions, such as Fidelity, Blackrock, and Morgan Stanley, have recently applied for Bitcoin Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). This institutional interest could bring a new wave of optimism to the cryptocurrency market, increasing demand and increasing prices. Bitcoin is facing challenges in its attempt to regain its 50-day moving average (MA) as a support level instead of being another resistance line. As of the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $29,200, representing a slight 0.6% decline over the last 24 hours.

Jeju, Busan, and Incheon Make the Cut On July 31, 2023, a local South Korean media outlet shared updates regarding preparations for the launch of the central bank digital currency (CBDC) in South Korea. The government has been working on the South Korean digital won since at least 2020 and has finally scheduled its pilot for the next year. According to the report, the Bank of Korea has chosen Jeju, Busan, and Incheon as candidates for the “private target CBDC test bed” in collaboration with commercial banks. In other words, one of these three regions will eventually be selected to test the public distribution process and the use of the CBDC as a means of payment. So far, Jeju has the highest chances of becoming the CBDC pilot site, as one of the bank officials explained: ""In the case of Busan, the number of eligible citizens is so large that the Bank of Korea is burdened in many ways, so the opinion was greatly inclined to Jeju, which has the next largest population."" It was also mentioned that the CBDC testing will be similar to the issuance and distribution structure of the current local currencies. South Korea introduced local currencies as alternative currencies issued by local governments to revitalize the local economies during the COVID-19 pandemic. All of the three suggested regions for the CBDC pilot are currently issuing and distributing their own local currencies (“Tamranjeon,” “Dongbaekjeon,” and “Incheon e-Eum”). This might be the reason why the Bank of Korea narrowed down these regions and bypassed Seoul. A commercial bank official said, ""The CBDC electronic wallet (app) will allow not only local residents but also many unspecified civilians such as tourists to open. We are in contact with distribution companies such as large supermarkets."" Obstacles for the South Korean CBDC Launch The report also revealed that unlike existing local currencies, the CBDC system has a lot of technical barriers to overcome. The Bank of Korea tested the payment performance of the CBDC system for about six months last year, and it was found to be inferior to major domestic micropayment operators in terms of processing speed. An official from the IT industry said, ""As the Bank of Korea is planning a large-scale retail payment system project soon, it is in need of an exceptionally large number of IT personnel. A large number of related personnel, including large companies, are on the move,” he explained. Besides, one of the biggest problems the South Korean digital market has been facing lately is a surge in criminal activities. To combat that, the government announced the launch of a multi-agency investigation unit earlier this month. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

July 30 was the single most profitable day ever for MEV on Ethereum, bringing in 6,006 ETH (roughly $11 million) for validators.  Whenever a massive, sudden reallocation of money happens in the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem – it could be due to a hack, exploit, price scare, news headline – there’s a category of crypto middlemen who stand to benefit from the increased transaction flows.  And that appears to be happening now following Sunday’s exploit of one of the best-known decentralized exchanges, Curve Finance, leading to a dramatic increase in profits for the validators running the Ethereum blockchain.  As users yanked their money out of the decentralized exchange platform, ostensibly fearing that their crypto assets might be at risk, transactions and transaction fees spiked, in turn leading to a surge in a type of middleman profits known as Maximal Extractible Value (MEV). This extra profit, enjoyed by validators of the Ethereum blockchain, comes from the reordering or inserting of transactions within a data block. They are a key component of trading revenue on Ethereum, sometimes compared to arbitrage or front-running in traditional markets.  The hack of Curve, which drained over $50 million from key liquidity pools on the platform, sparked an exodus that pushed its “total value locked” or collateral down to $1.7 billion on Monday, from more than $3 billion on Sunday, according to data provider DeFiLlama.  The frenzy of transactions resulted in a total of 6,006.23 ETH (or roughly $11 million) in MEV rewards on July 30 being paid out to Ethereum validators. It was the most ever, according to researchers who track these profits.  Ethereum core developer Eric Conner shared in a tweet that slot 6,992,273 had the highest MEV of 584 ETH (roughly $1.09 million), followed by slot 6,993,342, which got 345 ETH, and then slot 6,992,050, with 247 ETH.  Validators on Ethereum earn MEV mainly through MEV-Boost, a middleware component innovated by research firm Flashbots that allows validators to request blocks from builders. MEV-Boost was introduced on Ethereum after the blockchain’s Merge last year, when Ethereum switched out its old proof-of-work consensus mechanism for proof-of-stake.  Toni Wahrstätter, an Ethereum researcher who created a leading MEV-Boost dashboard, told CoinDesk that “the value directed to validators and proposers has reached levels last seen during the USDC depegging event in March. Profits from transaction fees and MEV have even surpassed those recorded during the FTX collapse, which had a widespread effect on the markets.”  According to Wahrstätter’s dashboard, mevboost.pics, yesterday’s exploit saw the highest day for just MEV rewards.  But during the depeg of USDC on March 11, transaction fees were higher, which contributed to larger MEV opportunities.  “The split between MEV and transaction fees is not straightforward to determine,” Wahrstätter told CoinDesk. “We saw huge transaction fees so it was definitely as a result of the transaction fees spiking, which contributes to larger MEV too.”  “But yeah, when USDC depegged, the whole effect was even more pronounced,” Wahrstätter said.

The company lost $1.1 billion in 2022 amid citing plunging crypto prices and the restructuring of Genesis.  “DCG has long stood out to me as the leading and most well-respected operator, investor, and backer of the brightest minds in the digital asset space,” Shifke said in a statement. “As the industry matures and digital assets continue to gain momentum from institutional stalwarts, I can’t think of a more exciting opportunity.”  Shifke previously served as CFO at Billtrust, which develops accounts receivable–software for companies, and CFO of Green Dot, a mobile-banking company and payments platform used by Apple, Walmart and Intuit.  “Following a comprehensive search for DCG’s next finance leader, I’m proud to welcome Mark Shifke as our new CFO,” DCG founder and CEO Barry Silbert said in a statement.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/07/31/digital-currency-group-appoints-mark-shifke-as-chief-financial-officer,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6ef92d6a85a4c2e44a521860bd100b45c2b9c6c2-1200x675.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42392834,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgCbG1,1690824551,After the Curve Attack: What's Next for DeFi?,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) is reeling from a recent spate of attacks on several key platforms on Sunday.  Some $70 million was stolen in total this weekend, including from Curve Finance, one of the most-used and influential decentralized exchanges, MetaMask developer Taylor Monahan estimated. Lending protocol Alchemix, yield platform Pendle and synthetic asset tool Metronome were all also hit, along with the decentralized NFT protocol JPEG.  In response, DeFi lenders began pulling funds out of other DeFi platforms including Aave, spiking borrowing fees across the specialized financial subsector, The Defiant reported.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Things undoubtedly could have been worse. In a something of a twist, white-hat hackers were able to remove assets from a few lending pools on Curve to prevent their theft. Moreover, three out of the five total malicious attacks were apparently “front run” by MEV (maximal extractable value) experts. MEV is a controversial, but unstoppable aspect of how public blockchains work, which allows third-parties and automated machines to search out and reorder unfinalized transactions waiting in the mempool for profit.  Coffeebabe.eth is responsible for reversing at least two of the malicious attacks by frontrunning the transactions, which may have been committed by multiple unconnected hackers. Chainlink, the on-chain data provider (aka “oracle” system), is also receiving some praise for preventing sector-wide collateral damage in the attack – but seemingly in a roundabout way. Had platforms like Aave or other DeFi lending protocols used the (now drained) CRV/ETH Curve pool as an on-chain oracle, they would have gotten completely rekt with bad debt,” LINK Marine ChainlinkGod tweeted. True enough, but maybe a tautology.  The nature of the attacks is apparently rooted in vulnerabilities found in a programming language called Vyper used specifically to launch smart contracts on Ethereum. The programming language’s core team – which was backed by the Curve team – announced that older versions of Vyper were vulnerable to “reentrancy” attacks. It could take days, weeks or months to truly understand what went wrong, though Vyper reps have said projects that use versions 0.2.15, 0.2.16 and 0.3.0 should reach out.  Hacks in the world of crypto are not exactly like hacks elsewhere. It’s increasingly common for attackers to return stolen funds, which are, by nature, always traceable on the blockchain, which can make it incredibly difficult for people to spend the tainted money or cash out anywhere without the entire world knowing about it. You’d think this would mean that attacks would be less common in crypto – but that is apparently not the case. Just today, security audit firm CertiK claimed that crypto users have lost at least $303 million from exploits in July 2023 alone.  While the technical aspects of the attacks are still being worked out, and the total fallout isn’t yet known, there may be at least one clear takeaway. In the days following the announcement of UniswapX, a new product from the team behind the most popular decentralized exchange Uniswap, which would essentially use off-chain mechanics to execute trades thereby saving Uniswap users in transaction fee costs, there has been talk about the future of DEXes. Apparently the world is moving in this direction: Cowswap and 0x and a bevy of protocols including now UniswapX are all using “best execution” models that take some aspects of crypto-trading off-chain.  See also: Calling a Hack an Exploit Minimizes Human Error | Opinion  To some extent, this brave new world of crypto trading makes sense. In any market where competitors have to innovate to attract users, costs will always trend to zero. Crypto traders have also demonstrated that’d they would often be willing to trade in some of the assurances of fully on-chain crypto for better prices, faster transactions or just a leg-up – and that is exactly what happens when you take some of the order book process behind the veil of a proprietary trading algorithm supposedly working in your favor. The fellows on “The Chopping Block” discussed all this in their most recent podcast.  But, in light of this recent black eye for DeFi, considering that even on-chain trade execution can apparently go so wrong, doesn’t it seem like an outsized risk to take out the only benefit that blockchain brings to commerce: immutability and transparency? I don’t know what the future of blockchain holds, but I’m increasingly told that it will not look like the familiar world of AMMs (automated market makers), but something more programmatic and automated. Maybe that will come to pass, but you’d think people would want to work out the kinks of crypto first.",NEGATIVE,LINK,BLOCKCHAIN | LINK | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/07/31/after-the-curve-attack-whats-next-for-defi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d0ac62064ce2ec4be4a77e255c3854f2411c90e-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42392850,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgCbVP,1690824269,Pass the Stablecoin Bill Now,"On July 27, H.R. 4766, the Clarity for Payments Stablecoins Act of 2023, passed out of committee with a bipartisan vote and now heads to the floor of the House for consideration. This means the United States, after years of inaction, now faces a historic opportunity to expand the reach of the dollar and financial access, both here and globally.  Stablecoins, which are the representation of a unit of fiat currency on a blockchain, have lacked any federal regulatory clarity in the United States to date despite having been created almost a decade ago, in 2014. This definition also reveals something very important about fiat-backed stablecoins in particular: they are old and understood financial products (stable value products) using new technology (blockchain).  Austin Campbell is the founder and managing partner of Zero Knowledge Consulting, and an adjunct Professor at Columbia Business School.  After the financial crisis, there was a significant period of reform in financial markets, where we gave preference to price stability products that worked properly, such as government money market funds or stable value funds, and penalized, restricted, or increased capital for those which did not work properly, such as deposits at highly leveraged banks, prime-money market funds, or securitizations. This means we know how to define safe, stable reserves for a stablecoin that are not a threat to financial markets, and H.R. 4766 does this.  At the same time, despite the lack of clarity and regulatory animus towards stablecoins in the United States, the space has grown internationally from zero to well over $100 billion in less than a decade. Every dollar that flows into stablecoins is funding for the U.S. Treasury at a time when we desperately need it. Every dollar that flows into stablecoins is a dollar that can leave an exploitative local financial system, or a high priced intermediary, and flow into a simple, transparent, cheap option if structured like the payments stablecoins in H.R. 4766.  Non-U.S. jurisdictions have realized the power of this innovation and are racing to take advantage of it. Singapore’s MAS has granted a payments license to Circle. Stablecoin projects are launching in Bermuda, in the UAE, and First Digital has already launched a USD stablecoin in Hong Kong. Tether, perhaps the biggest beneficiary of the U.S. antipathy towards stablecoins, has existed in amorphous offshore form since 2014 and now controls $80 billion in assets. It recently reported profits for Q2 of more than $1 billion.  Read more: What Is a Stablecoin?  This means that the decision we face in the United States is not Yes to stablecoins vs. No to stablecoins. It is ‘yes’ to stablecoins vs. ‘yes’ to stablecoins offshore. That stablecoins will proceed elsewhere means this is a critical decision for the United States from both a national security standpoint and a financial stability one.  Onshore stablecoins, where the United States regulates the issuer, means that we will have the ability to perform client due diligence and understand money flows on every individual and corporation engaging in the minting or burning of the stablecoins, giving us concrete knowledge of the starting point and ending point of every transaction that touches traditional dollar rails after being on a blockchain. It also means that we can ensure the reserves are transparent, segregated, properly managed, and put into instruments that are both stable for consumers and help fund the U.S. government and economy at a time of rising rates and growing deficits.  In a worst case scenario, if the United States does not act, it also risks having the dollar no longer be the defining unit of account for crypto and blockchain. Perhaps it could be the euro, owing to the passage of MiCA? Perhaps it could be the yuan, owing to China re-opening Hong Kong as a crypto hub and embracing the technology once more?  Tether is the biggest beneficiary of U.S. antipathy towards stablecoins  Certainly, the global share of reserves held in dollars have been falling and the BRIC nations have been actively searching for alternatives to continued use of the dollar, including blockchain-based solutions. A future where several decades forward blockchain technology is the backbone of financial services, but dollars are barely used and all of the information about the individuals or corporations transacting are in the hands of foreign governments who may not be friendly to the United States is a bleak one for both the U.S. economy and the strength of the dollar.  On the flip side of the coin, if H.R. 4766 is passed, the United States will have a regulatory framework that is likely best-in-class globally. Stablecoins will have federal recognition, with smaller projects able to be regulated at the state level allowing for experimentation, but larger projects eventually being drawn into the federal regulatory apparatus. The payments stablecoins allowed within the bill will be transparent, conservatively reserved, with prudential oversight and clear rules around redemption and consumer protection. In short, they will work exactly like what they are supposed to represent: safe, secure dollars on a blockchain.  This is why it is paramount for the United States to act, as we cannot risk creating a future where it becomes a bit-player in global markets. In that light, the arguments against advancing the stablecoin bill simply do not hold water. Stablecoins are not a systemic threat, as they are financial instruments we are already familiar with, merely using different ledger technology.  The only losers if H.R. 4766 advances are entrenched incumbents, like Tether, charging exorbitant fees of those who wish to use our financial system for payments. I will shed no tears on their behalf, and would urge the House and the Senate to embrace open, fair competition where the U.S. is able to unleash innovation and our drive to bring better financial technology and inclusion to the world.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Austin Campbell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/07/31/pass-the-stablecoin-bill-now,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ecf3a315b214ed22c93c518c4d85cab0eb44de23-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The landscape is filled with rug pulls and scams so far, however, doling out tears instead of dreams to many.  The lure of meme-coin fortunes in a starved market helped Coinbase’s new layer-2 blockchain Base attract some $68 million in ether (ETH), over $200 million in trading volumes and more transactions than popular networks such as Arbitrum over the weekend.  The twist? The network’s not even officially live yet, at least to the public.  So-called bridges like Base are blockchain-based tools that allow for the transfer of tokens between two or more networks. Base, built by crypto exchange Coinbase on OP Stack, went live for developers earlier in July so they could test applications and blockchain-based products before a planned launch later this year.  On-chain data shows over $68 million worth of ether was bridged to the network in the past 48 hours amid meme coin BALD’s massive surge. (Before the weekend, inflows only amounted to about $500,000 to $700,000 a day.) The most-active wallet moved $13 million in ether to the network; no one else exceeded $1 million.  How the mania started  BALD, tradeable via the LeetSwap decentralized exchange (DEX) built on top of Base, caught fire over the weekend, jumping about 4,000,000% from issuance to its peak price and seeing more than $100 million traded in 24 hours.  News of the surge went viral in crypto circles on social media application X, attracting scores of traders to bridge funds to the network – despite the lack of a functional two-way bridge – on the hunt for easy fortunes. One such trader managed to turn $500 to $1.5 million in under 12 hours, riling up the greedy parts of what is an already get-rick-quick market mentality.  Read more: Trader Turns $500 to Million-Dollar Fortune With BALD Memecoin on Coinbase’s Blockchain  Base-based tokens such as brian (BRIAN), toshi (TOSHI), basedbot (BOT) and several others jumped several thousand percent to earn early investors a huge multiple on their initial capital.  The lack of fundamentals behind these tokens, however, meant early buyers and influencers made the most gains – while followers were dumped on for exit liquidity.  Elsewhere, opportunistic developers deployed hundreds of tokens only to rugpull later on. Some users even complained they couldn’t sell popular picks, such as BALD and BOT, only to find out they purchased an imitation – one that couldn’t be sold on the open market.  Unlikely to last  Meanwhile, some traders told CoinDesk that the rush of capital was from token holders likely searching for a way to earn money in an otherwise flat market.  “Each investor has their own risk appetite, and these swings in volatility do offer excellent opportunities to lock in profits as well,” said Jeff Mei, chief operating officer of crypto exchange BTSE. “Clearly, meme coin culture is here to stay, as retail traders’ retain their influence on the crypto landscape, despite recent growing interest in crypto among TradFi.”  “That said, it’s important not to get blindsided by these FOMO rallies. Meme coins are a hyper-speculative and volatile class of crypto tokens. Generally, these coins lack practical uses compared to more established tokens like ETH,” Mei added.  Some like Mikolaj Zakrzowski, Web3 analyst at on-chain analytics tool CryptoQuant, were less upbeat about Base’s prospects, however.  “Most importantly, one address single-handedly bridged over $17 million worth of ether. An address ranked second bridged merely $2 million worth of ether,” Zakrzowski said in a Telegram message. “It appears that the rise of Base blockchain is not supported by fundamentals.”  “A single entity greatly influenced the total value locked in the Base protocol during recent days,” Zakrzowski concluded.  Meanwhile, some market observers such as Matan Doyich, cofounder at Crypto Index, say Base is a network to generally watch out for given its ties to Coinbase.  ""While you of course need to be careful of dramatic spikes in the crypto ecosystem which more times than not end quite badly, especially for late entrants, in the case of Base blockchain we can see that there are powerful entities and collaborations behind the project,"" Doyich shared in a Telegram message. ""Therefore, even from just these aspects alone it is worthwhile keeping a close eye on the network.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/07/31/coinbases-new-base-blockchain-gobbled-up-68m-in-ether-and-its-not-even-officially-live-yet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3314673241fd5baa1bcd662d8ae55bc164d6c0a5-4961x3508.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Although its $1 billion “operational profit” represents a decline from the first quarter, there is a 30% increase in comparison with the Q2 of 2022. Tether also disclosed a share buyback amounting to $115 million and its other investments in energy-related initiatives which are financed by some of the profits from Q2. “The investment in energy-related initiatives is not included in the CRR as these are not considered by Tether as an eligible reserve for the token in circulation, the company clarified. Related Reading: US Presidential Candidate Defends Bitcoin, Calls Out Environmental Critics Tether Sees Increase In Excess Reserves Tether’s excess reserves in the second year of this year increased by $850 million, taking its total excess reserves to around $3.3 billion. These excess reserves are the profits the company doesn’t share as dividends to shareholders. Instead, it holds them to shore up its 100% reserves used in backing all USDT in circulation and maintaining the token’s stability. The company has explained that keeping an additional 4% of its assets within its reserves is one of its risk management decisions as it aims to protect customers’ funds. It believes this move is necessary and one that other players should emulate, as under-collateralization, brings weakness to the whole system. USDT market cap at $83.8 billion | Source: Market Cap USDT on Tradingview.com Remaining Committed To Transparency In 2021, Tether agreed to release quarterly reports on its reserves for two years as part of its settlement with the authorities. However, the company continues to release these reports as part of its commitment to transparency despite fulfilling its agreement with the authorities earlier this year. As part of the report, Tether’s CTO stated: Transparency is not just a buzzword for us; it is the cornerstone of our philosophy. We believe that open communication and strong financials foster trust and reliability, and this is what the global community deserves especially in a year devastated by many failures across the banking and crypto industry.

42392846,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgCc5J,1690822085,Tiny Bitcoin ATM Firm Plans to Fight Giant Swiss Regulator in David vs Goliath Battle,"The operator of 45 Bitcoin ATMs in Switzerland is moving ahead with a complaint against FINMA for lowering the limits on Bitcoin ATM transactions that require users to reveal their identity.  FINMA says Bitcoin ATMs are used by drug traffickers, hence the need to tighten the rules.  Bity has crowdfunded almost 20,000 Swiss francs to pay its legal bills.  As governments crack down on crypto following 2022’s blowups, a relatively small Bitcoin ATM operator in Switzerland is pushing back against that nation’s main markets regulator, arguing its rules are too onerous.  Bity, the nine-year-old firm that runs 45 ATMs in Switzerland, has begun a David-versus-Goliath legal challenge against the Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), and is crowdfunding donations to help pay its legal bills, telling potential contributors: “FINMA is fighting crypto! We are fighting back!”  It’s raised almost 20,000 Swiss francs (about $23,000) so far toward its 25,000-franc goal.  What angered Bity is FINMA tightening know-your-customer (KYC) rules. Anyone using a Bitcoin ATM in Switzerland must now do a KYC check – in other words, reveal their identity – if they transact more than 1,000 francs (about $1,150) over a 30-day period. This is being implemented in an undemocratic way, Bity Chairman Alexis Roussel said in an interview.  Bity’s complaint points to what it sees as a regulatory gray area, since FINMA-licensed entities do not include money transfer-type businesses, and it should be up to self-regulatory organizations (SROs) such as financial standards association VQF to define how members best implement anti-money laundering laws.  However, the soft power of FINMA has seen these SROs automatically including new rules and becoming an echo chamber, without a clear ability to legally challenge these rules, according to Roussel.  “Normally, this Ordinance only applies to firms that have a license with FINMA,” Roussel said. “It doesn’t apply to companies like Bity or like Western Union or any wealth manager. But there’s a soft power system at play here which is very blurry, and whenever [FINMA] put something in their own Ordinance, all the other self-regulatory organizations have to follow this rule.”  FINMA’s stance  However, these money transfer firms are subject to “monitoring due diligence obligations under the AMLA [Anti-Money-Laundering Act],” FINMA said, declining to comment specifically on Bity’s complaint.  “The background for lowering the threshold is not only the international standards (recommendation of the FATF, the standard setter in the field of anti-money laundering, which has set the threshold of USD/EUR 1000 for virtual currencies), but also the high money laundering risks associated with such services,” FINMA said in an emailed statement.  “Indeed, there is concrete evidence that cryptocurrency ATMs in Switzerland have been misused as a common means of payment by certain drug trafficking networks,” FINMA added, citing media reports on the Vitamintaube case.  Self-regulatory organization VQF did not respond to requests for comment.  According to Roussel, a lawyer by trade and also the chief operating officer of crypto privacy-focused startup Nym, FINMA changed the rules for Bitcoin ATMs without doing any analysis and ignoring all the respondents of a consultation, who were uniformly opposed to the proposed change.  Roussell also pointed out that the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which informs regulators about things like lowering transaction thresholds for identifying people in the financial system, is “a non-democratic system that has no jurisdiction in Switzerland.”  In addition, FINMA’s “concrete evidence” that cryptocurrency ATMs in Switzerland are used by drug trafficking networks is based on sensationalist media reporting, Roussel said, centered on a handful of non-compliant crypto ATMS clustered around a railway station in Switzerland, none of which are still in operation.  “The crypto industry is stronger now and won’t be pushed around as easily as it has been in the past,” Roussel said, “FINMA was able to do this because they were never put in check.”  CORRECTION (July 31, 2023, 17:02 UTC): Gives Alexis Roussel's correct title, which is chairman of Bity.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/07/31/tiny-bitcoin-atm-firm-plans-to-fight-giant-swiss-regulator-in-david-vs-goliath-battle,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5404d8d4fba58cba3d4a3b32dad2cf365333e7ab-2000x1335.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Tether Excess Reserves Reach $3.3B Despite a Dip in the Quarterly Net Profit On Monday, July 31, the top stablecoin issuer Tether Holdings Limited issued its new quarterly attestation report. The assurance opinion for Q2 of 2023 was completed by BDO, a global independent accounting firm. The attestation re-affirms the accuracy of Tether’s Consolidated Reserves Report (CRR), providing a detailed breakdown of the Group's assets as of June 30, 2023. According to the report, a surplus of $850 million in net profit brought the company’s total excess reserves to the all-time-high of $3.3 billion at the end of Q2. However, the increase itself is almost twice lower compared to the previous quarter’s net profit which was reported to be around $1.5 billion. Tether reminded that its excess reserves are the company’s own profits and not distributed to shareholders. These reserves are kept in addition to the 100% reserves that “Tether maintains to back all the outstanding tokens”. It was also revealed that during the period of April 2023 to June 2023, Tether’s operational profits exceeded $1B, showing once again a 30% growth. Meanwhile, the company's share buyback amounted to 115M USD, the sum aimed at strengthening the shareholder group. As for Tether’s reserves, they continue to be extremely liquid, with around 85% of investments held in cash or cash equivalents. Both Tether’s CRR and the BDO attestation confirm that Tether’s consolidated assets once more surpass its consolidated liabilities. The Management of the Company reported that as of June 30, 2023: “The Group’s consolidated total assets amount to at least US$ 86,499,251,218. The Group’s consolidated total liabilities amount to US$ 83,200,775,340 of which US$ 83,178,020,411 relate to digital tokens issued. The Group’s consolidated assets exceed its consolidated liabilities.” USDT Market Cap Approaches $84B Mark, Its New ATH Tether’s USDT remains to be the top stablecoin on the crypto market. According to CoinMarketCap, USDT is now the third largest coin by market capitalization, following Bitcoin and Ethereum. This month, USDT’s market cap reached the new high of $84 billion which the coin last approached in May of 2022. It is a large increase since the beginning of the year when the coin’s market cap number stood at only $66 billion. Paolo Ardoino, CTO of Tether, commented on the attestation report, “Transparency is not just a buzzword for us; it is the cornerstone of our philosophy… With a firm focus on transparency, we aim to shape a future where every participant in the global financial ecosystem can confidently navigate a realm built on trust and innovation.

Alejandro Navia, president of NFT Now, posted a tweet sharing that the company had scaled too quickly in the bull market and now had to reduce staff at the company.  “As we are building the business for the long term, we must adapt to changing market conditions,” said Navia. “Given the current climate, it is clear that this pace of growth was unsustainable and we over-hired.”  Navia shared that as President, he “[takes] full ownership of this mistake,” and aims to continue to support its partners and tokenized media business.  Web3 media or tokenized media publications aim to solve the problems associated with Web2 media firms by selling NFTs that create a community around their content creation. In March, NFT Now released its Now Pass token, which quickly sold out in March for 0.25 ETH, or $500 each – raking in $1.1 million in total revenue.  The layoffs reflect a different sentiment than Navia shared as recently as Saturday, when Navia posted a tweet sharing that NFT Now has thus far been able to “change 100s of artists' lives, help onboard world-class brands to web3, keep millions of people educated and informed and build new technology to keep the truth authenticated and accessible.”  Different drama affected another founder of NFT Now over the weekend. The CEO and Editor-in-Chief Matt Medved’s Twitter was hacked in a SIM swap – a common malicious tactic to steal a person’s phone number. He shared a tweet Sunday that he had regained access to his account.  NFT Now has undergone other internal structural changes recently.

Signed by accounting firm BDO Italy, the attestation disclosed about $72.5 billion of exposure to U.S. Treasuries, including direct T-bill investments, repurchase agreements and deposits in money market funds.  The company's bitcoin (BTC) holdings as of June 30 increased in dollar value to $1.67 billion from $1.5 billion three months earlier, according to the filing, though the number of tokens held was not disclosed.  Tether said its operational profits exceeded $1 billion for the second quarter. In May, the firm reported $1.45 billion in ""net profits"" in Q1.  Tether is the issuer behind the $83 billion USDT, the largest stablecoin by market capitalization, and some smaller stablecoins. USDT is a key piece of the crypto ecosystem facilitating trading and asset transfers.  Issuing fiat-backed dollar-pegged stablecoins is a lucrative business due to rising U.S. government bond yields, the primary reserve asset for USDT. Tether's reported profits are close those of asset management giant BlackRock – with more than $9 trillion in assets under management (AUM) – which booked operating income of just over $1.6 billion in Q2.

Some 93% of the outflows were from long-bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) products, the report noted, while short-bitcoin experienced its 14th straight week of outflows totaling $3.1M. For the week, which saw the Federal Reserve resume its interest-rate hikes, bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) rose only 0.5% and ethereum ( ETH-USD ) advanced 1.3% , as seen in this chart .

Kennedy spoke out in support of the cryptocurrency. According to RFK, arguments against adopting Bitcoin due to perceived environmental impact are merely a cover to curtail financial freedom. Responding to the tweet by Feldman, RFK stated that “… environmental arguments should be used as a smokescreen to curtail freedom to transact.” RFK, who is a holder of BTC, has previously disclosed his intention to return the USD to hard currency backed with assets such as BTC. Bitcoin And The Environment One of the challenges of Bitcoin adoption is the perceived threat it poses to the environment. According to anti-crypto campaigners and politicians, bitcoin mining is harmful due to its high energy requirement. Related Reading: Ahead Of The Pack: Binance Moves Forward With New License in Dubai This argument is a prominent position within the political and environmental protection ecosystem, so much so that campaigners like Greenpeace have accused BTC of destroying the planet. However, while Bitcoin mining is energy-intensive, it utilizes more renewable energy presently than ever before. This position was further reiterated by Daniel Feldman, director of Sangha Systems. According to him, there exists a “symbiotic relationship” between Bitcoin and renewable energy. Agreeing with the popular Democratic candidate, Feldman noted that bitcoin mining offers a solution to boost the electric grid and limit dependence on fossil fuels. He, however, noted that “most renewable energy sites are not profitable without government subsidies.” BTC price maintains tight range at $29,450 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Subsidies in the form of tax credits generate market distortions and the flow of these credits is managed by banks who are often bailed out by governments during financial crises, the very banks that Bitcoin seeks to free people from. According to Feldman, renewable energy sites experience curtailment and congestion challenges due to the absence of global markets to sell to during demand troughs. BTC solves this challenge by providing a universal market for electricity that will boost investments in renewable energy projects. A Look Into BTC Energy Usage Renewable energy arguments are popular within the green energy industry as they continually seek the flexibility offered by crypto mining operations. However, they are still faced with serious opposition from the media and the political establishment, who believe BTC mining will boil the planet. Related Reading: Here’s How Long The Majority Of New Ethereum Wallets Are Used Before They’re Dumped According to data obtained from Cambridge University, it is estimated that global BTC mining activities are currently pegged at 137 TW/h (terawatt hours) per year. This figure surpasses the energy usage of countries such as Ukraine, which utilizes 134 TW/h. In contrast, the electricity distribution and transmission losses in the US are sufficient to power BTC 1.5 times with 206 TW/h per year.

""Orange pilling"" is a term given to the process of a bitcoin non-believer becoming a believer  BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF application in June showed signs of breaking the deadlock in the SEC approval process for such a fund in the U.S.  BlackRock (BLK) CEO Larry Fink has been ""orange-pilled,"" or converted from being a bitcoin (BTC) nonbeliever into a believer, Mike Novogratz said in an interview with Bloomberg last week.  Novogratz, CEO of crypto-focused financial services firm Galaxy Digital (GLXY), said Fink is ""the most important thing that happened this year in bitcoin,"" because of BlackRock's application to list a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S. in June.  “Larry was a nonbeliever. Now he says, ‘Hey, this is going to be a global currency.’ People around the world all trust it,” Novogratz said  The possibility of BlackRock, one of the world's largest asset management firms, leading the way among a flurry of spot bitcoin ETFs possibly gaining regulatory approval in the U.S. is part of an ""adoption cycle,"" in the cryptocurrency industry, Novogratz said.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has rejected dozens of applications to list spot bitcoin ETFs, a policy that has been seen as a major factor inhibiting wider mainstream crypto adoption. BlackRock's application included a ""surveillance-sharing"" agreement, which is supposed to guard against market manipulation and is considered to make it more acceptable to the SEC. Several other asset managers subsequently refiled applications also including such an agreement.  Novogratz also called Ripple's recent partial victory over the SEC in their legal battle a victory for crypto because it demonstrated that ""the rules are nothing close to clear."" The judge in the case ruled that the sale of XRP tokens on exchanges and through algorithms did not constitute investment contracts, in contradiction to the SEC's long-held view.

15491412,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545232,1690816805,Breaking: HEX Token Plummets 25% Following SEC Lawsuit Against Founder Richard Heart,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Richard “Heart” Schueler and crypto projects HEX, PULSECHAIN, and PULSEX. According to a document filed with a court for the Eastern District of New York and shared on X by economist Alex Krüeger, the regulator is violating U.S. securities laws. Related Reading: Is Another Bitcoin Rally Coming Soon? This Pattern May Say So As of this writing, HEX is feeling the heat from the lawsuit. The token plummeted over 11% in today’s trade session alone as a direct impact of this development. It continues a downside trend that worsened over the past two weeks when the cryptocurrency saw a 23% loss. SEC Fails With XRP But Goes After HEX Per the document, the regulator claims that Richard Heart raised over $1 billion by allegedly offering unregistered security, the token HEX. The crypto founder supposedly offered the token in December 2019 and for the following three years to “retail investors in the U.S. and abroad.” The SEC claims that Heart operates via PulseChain and PulseX, part of the scheme that allegedly allows him to raise $1 billion from investors. Via these platforms, the regulator argues, Heart made “grandiose” promises of wealth to his investors. Furthermore, the Commission claims that while Heart publicly spoke about supporting free speech, he supposedly purchased “luxury goods” by taking money from his investors. In that sense, the SEC claims that the crypto investor misappropriated his investors’ assets and allegedly defrauded investors. The regulator placed a special focus on HEX’s staking mechanism, its “locked up” periods, and how Heart allegedly manipulated the token’s supply by “recycling transactions.” The document stated: Between December 2019 and November 2020, Heart, via the Hex public wallet address, accepted more than 2.3 million ether (“ETH”), putatively from investors, worth more than $678 million at the time of deposits (…). It appears that 94-97% of these ETH deposits, however, were “recycling” transactions directed by Heart or other insiders, which enabled Heart or other insiders to gain control of a large number of Hex tokens (…). Consensus In The Crypto Community The U.S. SEC is coming out of a major loss after a court ruled out against their claims in the case versus payment company Ripple and its executives. The regulator stated that the company offered unregistered securities. However, unlike the Ripple and XRP case, the crypto community is taking the SEC’s side and believes the regulator is on the right track. Heart has been a controversial figure for years in the nascent industry. Bloomberg Intelligence’s James Seyffart stated the following regarding the case: I may have been cheering for ripple to win their case despite not really liking the project (and honestly thinking it had many security-like traits). But I will be 100% pro SEC in this case. This is the type of project the SEC should have gone after years ago. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Prospects: Can The Memecoin Climb To The $0.1 Level?

42392849,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgCcUx,1690816627,Ribbon Finance Settles First On-Chain Ether 'Autocallable' With Marex and MEV Capital,"Crypto trading firms are teaming up with traditional market players to trade onchain structured products amid a U.S. regulatory push to oversee the industry.  Digital assets manager MEV Capital and London-based financial services provider Marex have executed an ""autocallable"" tied to ether(ETH) through a smart contract built by the leading decentralized derivatives platform Ribbon Finance, now rebranded as Aevo.  ""We are thrilled to provide the smart contract for the first fully on-chain autocallable trade, which represents a significant milestone for both Ribbon Finance and the structured products industry at large,"" Jeremy Obadia, Head of Structured Derivatives at Ribbon Finance, told CoinDesk. ""Encoding complex payoffs on-chain not only removes the counterparty risk but also allows for a trustless and automated trade lifecycle.""  An autocallable is a structured note that allows investors to earn contingent interest, usually at an above-market rate, if the underlying asset closes at or above a specific level on periodic observation dates. It can be redeemed early and often offers contingent downside protection when held to maturity.  MEV purchased the two-week ether autocallable denominated in the dollar-pegged stablecoin USDC, with a barrier at 85% of the initial price, autocall trigger at 100% and guaranteed coupon of 0.5% per week (annualized 26%). Marex acted as a hedging agent.  How it works: If, after one week, the ether spot price is above the initial price at the time of the trade, the trade terminates early, with the buyer receiving the initial investment plus the 0.5% coupon. If, on expiry, ether trades 15% lower from the initial price, the buyer stands protected, receiving the principal in full along with the coupon. However, if the 85% protection barrier is breached (ether drops over 15%), the buyer takes the loss, which is compensated by coupons to some extent.  ""On-chain deployment of exotic options such as autocallables would allow us to enhance several of our market-neutral strategies while staying on Ethereum - a public blockchain we are familiar with,"" Laurent Bourquin, Managing Partner at MEV Capital, said.  The autocallable traded by MEV is suitable for market conditions where ether's price is not expected to move much in either direction. That's because the buyer stands to lose if the price drops below the barrier level. Similarly, the buyer stands to lose on the upside, as the product is terminated if the underlying trades above the initial price after one week.  Structured products like autocallables can be set up in a myriad of ways and are quite popular in traditional finance. More than $70 billion in U.S. structured notes were issued last year. Banks typically issue these, with the issuing lender acting as the 'counterparty' for investors. As such, there is a risk of investors losing money not because the product fails to deliver but because of the demise of the bank backing the product.  Marex, MEV and Ribbon eliminated the so-called counterparty risk by locking the maximum payout and collateral in a secured and audited smart contract.  ""Bringing Autocallables on-chain and leveraging smart contract features make these products more transparent for investors, allowing instant settlement, seamless lifecycle and removing issuer credit risk. The blockchain technology will change the way products are transacted,"" Harry Benchimol, Co-Head of Derivatives Engine at Marex Solutions, said.  ""Given how yield farming is important in DeFi, it is exciting to see the Autocallable entering this fast-evolving ecosystem, providing a new way to extract yield while having some downside protection,"" Benchimol added.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/31/ribbon-finance-settles-first-on-chain-ether-autocallable-with-marex-and-mev-capital,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c43a264475ce007cac3bb53053efae7557aaaf0c-1920x1274.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Here’s What This Founder Thinks,"In the wake of a massive exploit, the price of the Curve (CRV) token has declined drastically, recording double-digit losses in the last day. This has led to what some would call an opportunity to buy cheap coins and Matrixport and Bitdeer founder Jihan Wu is one of the believers. A Good Time To Buy Curve (CRV)? Jihan Wu recently tweeted that he bought the CRV dip. According to Wu, he remains a strong believer in the token because of its future applications. Wu’s tweet comes at a time when Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platform Curve DAO’s native token CRV has been down by more than 12% in the last 24 hours. This dip came following an exploit in some of Curve’s stablecoin pools. Related Reading: Here’s How Long The Majority Of New Ethereum Wallets Are Used Before They’re Dumped The exploit on the protocol reportedly occurred due to a bug in the Vyper programming language, which is used to power part of the DEX’s ecosystem. Despite this occurrence, Wu believes that this is a good time to invest in the CRV tokens as these tokens will play a significant role in the coming RWA (Real World Assets) wave in reference to the tokenization of physical assets. “In the coming RWA wave, $crv is one of the most important infrastructures. I have BTFD. NFA,” the founder said in the tweet. Without a doubt, the tokenized industry is growing and boasts immense potential. Last year, a World Economic Forum survey projected the tokenized assets industry to account for almost 10% of the global GDP by 2027. The tokenization of real-world assets will involve bringing physical assets like houses, arts, and precious metals on-chain. This will undoubtedly provide easier access and promote fractional ownership of these assets. CRV price declines over 14% following exploit | Source: CRVUSD on Tradingview.com As Wu has highlighted, DeFi protocols like Curve and tokens like CRV will play an integral role in facilitating transactions involving the transfer and trade of these tokenized assets. DeFi Security Remains A Stumbling Block The several exploits on DeFi protocols continue to remain a huge problem in the DeFi ecosystem and something which many consider a stumbling block to the wider adoption of DEXs over CEXs by many crypto users. Recently, Curve Finance’s Omnipool platform, Conic Finance, suffered an exploit that resulted in the hacker stealing over $3 million in Ether.

Surprisingly, Pepe experienced a phenomenal rally after its launch on April 16th, achieving a 7000% price pump within just 17 days. However, its price sharply dropped to $0.000001153 on May 12th, 2023, and has been on a decline since then. According to CoinMarketCap, Pepe is bullish today trading at $0.00000143, an increase of 12% in the last 24 hours. This is coming after huge whale activity. Lookonchain, a blockchain analytics firm, revealed that two whales bought over 1.56 trillion tokens. This is about 1,100 ETH ($2.06 million). Although Pepe's price has dropped, it still maintains a robust market cap of over $500 million. However, being a meme coin with no use case, Pepe would have a tough time reaching $0.01. Besides, Pepe will have to soar more than 600,000x to reach $0.01. Floki Inu (FLOKI) Drops 8% on the Weekly Chart The Floki Inu (FLOKI) project initially started as a meme-coin based on Elon Musk's dog. However, it has since evolved into a fully-fledged web3 project, spanning DeFi, NFTs, and the Metaverse. The Floki token is now famously referred to as ""The People's Crypto."" Meanwhile, Floki Inu is bearish on the weekly timeframe, trading at $0.00002243. This is an 8.01% price decline in the past 7 days. Floki Inu is 93.46% away from its all-time high of $0.0003437. Similarly, Floki Inu's trading volume has been on a steep decline. It has dropped by about 24.10% in the last 24 hours, a sign of low market activity and support from investors. Looking forward, Floki Inu has a bleak chance of hitting 0.01$ in 2023. Analysts: Pomerdoge (POMD) To Skyrocket 4,000% Unlike Pepe and Floki Inu, Pomerdoge has a great utility that would increase its price in 2023. Currently, the token's price stands at a mere $0.007. Despite this, analysts express a bullish outlook on the project, projecting an impressive 4,000% ROI for potential investors. Pomerdoge aims to capitalize on the potential of the blockchain gaming market as a P2E cryptocurrency game. As per MarketsandMarkets, the global blockchain gaming market will hit $65.7 billion by 2027.

Meanwhile, Stellar (XLM) and TRON (TRX) have struggled to stop their investors from agitating. Tradecurve has become an instant hit after entering the market. It has raised around $180k during its presale so far. >>Register For The Tradecurve Presale Stellar (XLM) Settles With Mediocre Gains Stellar (XLM) has been one of the best performers in 2023. But the recent weeks have been mediocre for Stellar. The market value of Stellar (XLM) tokens has dropped by 12% in the past week. However, Stellar has risen by 2% on the monthly chart. However, the current trading price of Stellar is 90% down from its peak of $0.94. Experts have cited Stellar’s recent partnerships as the main reason behind the increase in the network’s price. Stellar recently hit the headlines after Brazil’s central bank selected it for the development of its digital currency, Digital Real. Besides, Stellar is now connected to Polkadot through the Pendulum parachain, which has added to the bullish momentum of XLM. Currently, Stellar is trading at $0.0943. >>Register For The Tradecurve Presale TRON’s (TRX) Development Activity Plunges Analysts have been closely observing the price trajectory of TRX since the US SEC filed a lawsuit against TRON founder, Justin Sun. Notably, TRON (TRX) lost 6% of its market value in March. Hence, any event having ramifications on TRON is of significance for investors, who will then decide to stay with the network. Besides a lawsuit against its founder, TRON has also suffered from a 36% plunge in the development activity on the network. These bearish events forced TRON to unveil its new staking mechanism called Stake 2.0. However, TRON has faced criticism after unveiling the new staking mechanism, as some of its community members have raised questions about the preparedness of the network for this update. A TRON token is currently available to purchase at $0.0653. Tradecurve (TCRV) Prepares a Solid Foundation For Mega Launch The overall crypto market is expanding its ecosystem rapidly. Its user penetration is expected to be 8.8% in 2023, and 12.5% by 2027, and the number of crypto traders can clock over 994 million in the next five years. Tapping this huge target market, Tradecurve (TCRV) is pegged to become one of the top three trading exchanges in the world. Existing trading platforms are either dealing with only cryptocurrencies, or exclusively facilitating the trade of conventional derivatives. But Tradecurve is a revolutionary platform thatallows the trading of cryptocurrencies, stocks, Forex, commodities, ETFs, bonds, and more, on from a single account. It has also rolled out an educational academy, where investors can learn new techniques and strategies to polish their skills.

The benefits of INS include human-readable names, increased security, improved accessibility, and resource identifiers. As stated by IoTeX in their blog announcing the IIP-22 voting period, “Crypto addresses are frustratingly long, garbled strings like “lswli4yuofd8a0s” – a clunky mechanism that often leaves room for error when inputting. And as cryptocurrencies become mainstream, there will be a substantial market for Web3 addresses.” Similarly to the ENS, INS allows users to register and manage human-readable domain names for their IoTeX addresses, smart contracts, decentralized websites, and other IoTeX-based resources. IoTeX’s INS promotes mass adoption by discovering decentralized services and applications more manageable by providing human-readable domain names, making it easier to search and navigate the blockchain ecosystem. The INS also provides a unified namespace across multiple dApps and blockchain platforms, enabling using the same INS domain name for various services, eliminating the need to remember different addresses for different applications. Regarding decentralization and security, INS operates on the IoTeX blockchain, leveraging the decentralized nature of blockchain technology. That ensures that domain ownership and control are in the hands of the users themselves, reducing the risk of censorship or manipulation. And it can be integrated into popular wallets, exchanges, and decentralized applications, allowing seamless use of domain names across various platforms and services. Users are empowered with INS as it gives them ownership and control over their domain names and associated cryptocurrency addresses. Users can update or transfer their domains as needed, providing a sense of empowerment and autonomy. IoTeX’s name service fosters a community-driven ecosystem where developers, organizations, and individuals can collaborate, build upon, and innovate, driving creativity and the development of new dApps and services. INS is yet another adaptation to simplify onboarding the masses to Web3 by IoTeX, leader of the Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN), the most significant trend in crypto that by 2028 will grow to over $3.5 trillion.

Exploits of Curve Finance and Multichain were the latest reminders of vulnerabilities in decentralized finance.  Crypto traders have lost $303 million worth of digital assets in cryptocurrency exploits and hacker attacks this month, security audit firm CertiK tweeted, putting July on track to be the worst month this year so far in terms of stolen value.  The report comes as decentralized finance (DeFi) investors are still reeling from this weekend’s exploit of decentralized exchange Curve Finance, a key infrastructure in the DeFi ecosystem. Since Sunday, Certik confirmed some $52 million in digital assets as having been siphoned from the protocol using a vulnerability in some versions of the popular smart contract coding language Vyper.  Earlier this month, roughly $125 million of assets were drained from blockchain bridging protocol Multichain. The platform then shuttered operations and said that Chinese authorities had detained chief executive Zhaojun in May.  Ari Redbord, head of legal and government affairs of blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs, said in a CoinDesk TV interview in May that DeFi protocols are the most vulnerable parts of the crypto ecosystem, adding that exploits are still happening at an ""unprecedented"" speed and scale.  Read more: 6 Kinds of Crypto Scams and How to Avoid Them  Of the $303 million this month, investors lost about $285 million in exploit attempts and hacks including the Multichain and Curve attacks, per CertiK’s data. Roughly $8.7 million of assets were drained abusing flash loans. This is a sophisticated exploit venue that lets traders borrow unsecured funds using smart contracts instead of third parties. These types of loans are legal, but attackers sometimes use them to manipulate the price of smaller, less liquid tokens for gains. The most notable example was DeFi protocol Conic Finance being drained of 1,700 ether (ETH), worth $3.26 million at the time, using flash loans.  Exit scams cost investors about $8.6 million.

15489086,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545146,1690810816,Is Another Bitcoin Rally Coming Soon? This Pattern May Say So,"On-chain data shows a pattern in the stablecoin shark and whale holdings that may suggest the Bitcoin rally could make a return in the near future. Stablecoin Sharks & Whales Have Been Accumulating Recently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the sharks and whales of the major stablecoins have been increasing their reserves while Bitcoin has been struggling recently. The “sharks” and “whales” are two of the largest cohorts in the sector, with investors belonging to the former holding at least $100,000 and at most $1 million worth of the asset, while the latter has wallet balances in the $1 million to $10 million range. Due to such large holdings, these investors can potentially move around a large number of coins at once, something that can make them influential entities in the market. In the context of the current discussion, the sharks and whales of stablecoins are of interest. In particular, the four largest players in the market are of relevance here: Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), Binance USD (BUSD), and Dai (DAI). Santiment has used its “Supply Distribution” metric to track the holdings of these humongous holders and this indicator tells us about the percentage of the supply that each group in the market is holding right now. Here is a chart that shows the trend in this metric specifically for the sharks and whales of the top 4 stablecoins in the sector: The metrics appear to have been going up in recent days | Source: Santiment on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the holdings of these stablecoin sharks and whales have been on the rise recently. Interestingly, while this trend has formed, the price of Bitcoin has dipped below the $30,000 level. A similar pattern in the supply held by these large investors had also formed last month, as these investors had been buying more stablecoins, while BTC had been on a decline. What followed this period of accumulation back then was a sharp Bitcoin rally that had taken the cryptocurrency’s price above the $30,000 level. An explanation of this curious trend may lie in what the holdings of these large stablecoin holders signify. Generally, these investors opt for stables whenever they want to exit volatile assets such as BTC. Related Reading: Stanford MBA Explains Why Next Bitcoin Cycle Could Be “Bigger” Such holders, however, usually only seek to temporarily take shelter in these dollar-tied tokens, because if they wanted to stay away from the sector for extended periods, they would have exited through other means like fiat. Thus, these investors would eventually shift their stablecoins into Bitcoin and others again, and with this exchange, provide a bullish boost to their prices. This is why the supply of these sharks and whales may be looked at as the available buying pressure that these humongous investors can put on the asset at any point they want. From the chart, it’s visible that the BTC rally above $30,000 didn’t actually kick off from new money being pumped back into the asset by the sharks and whales, but rather the conversions that they made back into the asset, as their holdings decreased while the rally happened.

As the large investors of the major stables have again been accumulating recently, it’s possible that Bitcoin could see a bullish effect from this down the road once more, although it’s uncertain how long it may be before these investors deploy their stablecoins back into the market.

The project is making waves in an industry set to be worth $455 billion by the end of the year. This milestone shows the growing hype and potential of Uwerx, placing it as a formidable player in the crypto market. This article will explore Uwerx's impressive achievements and the factors that have led to its progress. >>BUY WERX TOKENS NOW Pepe (PEPE) Falls Behind Pepe (PEPE), adapted from the iconic movie character Pepe The Frog, stands as one of the leading memecoin in the crypto space. The coin became popular by giving extraordinary 5000%+ returns since inception. A significant purchase has sparked interest in the crypto space. A tech entrepreneur and controversial musician, Jeffrey Huang, popularly known as Machi Big Brother, made the front page by buying a staggering 6 billion PEPE tokens for just $12,000. Industry observers are watching closely with many questions trying to figure out the moves of this prominent musician in the crypto ecosystem. How Does This Affect PEPE? Pepe (PEPE) has had a very optimistic look, trading at $0.000001369, with a significant daily increase of over 45%. However, it is paramount to note that Pepe (PEPE) still lags behind Uwerx's WERX token, which is priced at $0.041 in the final/fifth funding presale round. The comparison shows the different market positions and valuations of these two coins. Despite having a bullish trend, experts still predict a potential fall of more than 5% for Pepe (PEPE). While making investment decisions, it is important to be very cautious and consider market facts to avoid huge losses. >>BUY WERX TOKENS NOW Uwerx (WERX) Is Secure, And Has Long-Term Prospects The crypto market has seen many crypto projects that have risen and fallen rapidly, creating a significant hole in the pockets of investors. As a result, investors have become more strict and scrutinize tokens more thoroughly before investing. Uwerx stands out because it has undergone thorough vetting and auditing by SolidProof and InterFi Network. These reputable entities have ensured transparency and security within the project and have given investors confidence and peace of mind. The project’s team has taken proactive measures to protect investors from potential losses and ensure the project's integrity. They have locked the team's tokens for nine months, eliminating the possibility of rug pulls and demonstrating the team's commitment to long-term success. In addition, when the project lists on centralized exchanges, the development team will renounce smart contract ownership, further safeguarding investors' interests. The team's tokens were locked on Wednesday, 7 June, and their token allocation was cut to 7% before getting locked, making room for more investors and distributing the project's benefits widely. Moreover, adding to its security measures, the platform provides the Uwerx Vault as a security and staking option for users. By using the Vault can earn rewards, creating an incentive for long-term holding. The Uwerx Vault is not the only offer that the project is giving. An amazing 15% purchase bonus is up for the take. This offer further incentivizes investors to maximize their returns and become a part of the thriving Uwerx community. Uwerx Sets Pace For Community Governance To ensure accuracy and user wallet verification, 98.2% of the community voted for a Test Airdrop initiative. The Test Airdrop proposal serves as a means to minimize the risk of mistakes. This proactive move emphasizes Uwerx's dedication to maintaining a secure and reliable platform for its users. With the project in its fifth funding presale round, enthusiasts have shown significant support leading to remarkable growth and increased popularity. The Uwerx community has about 8,500 sign-ups, 2,200 Telegram members, and 1,800 Twitter followers and continues to grow rapidly. For the fifth funding stage, the project has a substantial token allocation of seventy-two million and five hundred thousand tokens out of a total supply of seven hundred and fifty million tokens. The WERX token is priced at $0.0564. The rise of WERX has propelled it to eclipse popular coins like PEPE and SHIB, and it is anticipated to soon surpass DOGE. The hard cap presale is on 31 July, so investing early will be very beneficial. By focusing on the freelancing ecosystem, Uwerx is well-suited to capitalize on the tremendous opportunities in the sector. Velocity Global reported that by the end of 2023, the freelancing economy is projected to be worth $455 billion. Utilizing an attractive position, Uwerx charges a low transaction fee of 1%, while other platforms charge high fees ranging from 10% to 20%. The Alpha Version of the platform features essential pages such as Sign-Up, Login, and Forgot Password, as well as Freelancer or Client Initiation, My Activity, and Initial Steps of Finding Talent and Job Creation. Additionally, new pages like Freelancer Profile Creation, Settings, Application Boosting, and Milestones were added based on valuable user feedback. Uwerx welcomes further input from users through feedback@uwerx.network. The developers utilize an agile methodology that ensures rapid deployment and accelerated development through user feedback. Excitingly, the development of the Beta version of the platform has started. As Uwerx increases its features and refines its offering, it is poised to become a leading player in the freelancing ecosystem. The project will soon eclipse Pepe (PEPE), solidifying itself as a promising contender in the freelancing and crypto space. From its innovative Alpha platform to a thriving and growing community, Uwerx is poised for great success. Join the community today and enjoy a 15% purchase bonus now!

15488048,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/japan-blockchain-association-requests-crypto-tax-reform,1690808268,Japan Blockchain Association Requests Crypto Tax Reform,"Japan’s Blockchain Association (JBA) reportedly urged the government to revise tax rules imposed on virtual assets. The JBA has called on the Japanese government to reform its crypto tax rules. The association argues the tax system in its current form hinders the growth of Web3 in Japan. Revised Tax Rules Will Foster Web3 Growth According to reports by local Japanese news website, Coinpost, the JBA requested that government reconsider its current tax system for virtual currencies as it hinders the growth of Web3 in the country. The organisation says its proposed revisions would allow more domestic companies to enter the burgeoning sector. The JBA also called for developing a crypto-friendly environment where citizens can own and use crypto assets. The JBA, led by co-founder and CEO of Bitflyer, Yuza Kano, suggest the following three reforms: Eliminating Year-End Unrealised Gain Tax on Third-Party Issued Tokens Japan’s National Tax Agency (NTA) amended rules on corporate tax rules which provide a tax exemption to companies issuing cryptocurrencies. Under its previous system, companies that issue cryptocurrencies must pay taxes on unrealised gains at the end of a tax period. The rules, however, did not change as they pertain to third-party token issuers. The JBA argues unrealised profit tax on third-party issuers is a barrier for domestic companies to enter the Web3 space. Changing the Taxation Method for Individual Crypto Asset Transactions to Separate Self-Assessment taxation, Applying a Uniform 20% Rate The JBA’s suggestions further state that losses should be carried forward and deducted in the three years after the year in which they occurred, thereby reducing tax. Eliminating Income Tax on Profits for Every Crypto Asset Transaction/Exchange The association opines that fostering an environment in which citizens want to invest will, in turn, increase the amount of tax the government can collect.

42392853,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgCckL,1690807972,First Mover Americas: Curve Finance Exploit Puts More Than $100M of Crypto at Risk,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Curve, a stablecoin-focused decentralized exchange (DEX), was the victim of an exploit late Sunday according to a tweet from the project. Curve relies on smart contracts instead of middlemen to offer financial services such as stablecoin borrowing, trading and lending to users. Upwards of $100 million worth of cryptocurrency are at risk due to a “re-entrancy” bug in Vyper, a programming language used to power parts of the Curve system. Several stablecoin pools on the platform — used for pricing and liquidity on a number of different DeFi services — have been drained by hackers so far, though the amount was unclear at press time. BlockSec, a blockchain auditing firm, estimated total losses above $42 million in a preliminary analysis posted to Twitter. While CRV, the DEX’s native token, was trading down 12% over the last 24 hours per Coinbase, it has interestingly surged 500% on South Korea-based digital assets exchange Bithumb.  Layer 2 chain Optimism’s native token OP surged higher on Monday, gaining 9% on the day, outperforming the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which was roughly flat on the session. The advance for OP comes as Base – an Optimism-based Coinbase-built layer 2 scaling chain – has seen an increase in transaction activity related to meme coins, including BALD, a newly-launched meme coin on Base reaching a market cap of $85 million late on Sunday. The Optimism network also saw a spike in transaction volume last week after OpenAI's Worldcoin launched on the network. The gains in transaction volume for Optimism meant it surpassed its rival Arbitrum for the first time in six months, according to Dune Analytics.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asked Coinbase (COIN) to stop trading in all cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin prior to suing the crypto exchange, CEO Brian Armstrong told the Financial Times. “We believe every asset other than bitcoin is a security,” said the SEC, according to Armstrong, who added that the agency declined to disclose its reasoning behind that conclusion. “We really didn’t have a choice at that point,” said Armstrong. “It would have essentially meant the end of the crypto industry in the U.S … Let’s go to court and find out what the court says.” On June 6, the SEC charged Coinbase with breaching federal securities law, alleging that it was simultaneously operating as a broker, an exchange and a clearinghouse for unregistered securities. Coinbase shot back saying the SEC's action violates due process and constitutes an abuse of discretion.  Chart of the Day  Among the many offshoots of Bitcoin, bitcoin gold (BTG), has risen 37% in the past 24 hours to $19, its highest single-day gain since July 2022.  The rally's exact reason is unknown, but the move appears to be a part of renewed investor interest in smaller tokens, including meme cryptocurrencies.  Smaller tokens, in general, are less liquid. A few buy/sell orders tend to have an outsized impact on the going market rate.  - Omkar Godbole  Trending Posts  Crypto Futures Show Bias for Uniswap's UNI Token After Curve Finance Exploit  Sam Bankman-Fried's Attempts to Influence Witnesses Show He Must Be Jailed Before Trial: DOJ  Binance's Activities Are Illegal in Nigeria, Securities Regulator Says",NEGATIVE,BTG,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BTG,"Lyllah Ledesma, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/31/first-mover-americas-curve-finance-exploit-puts-more-than-100m-of-crypto-at-risk,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b035bcebbf5348a357c34d15ba57387738402ebc-3353x2514.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

An ascending trendline represents a price chart that connects a series of higher lows over time. It acts as a visual guide to tracking the price movements of an asset, indicating a bullish sentiment in the market. Related Reading: XRP Struggles In Its Journey To $1: Market Observers Share Contrasting Views As of the latest data from CoinGecko, Dogecoin price stands at $0.079, experiencing a minor 24-hour slump of 0.9%. However, it has still managed an impressive seven-day rally of 7.2%, hinting at the potential for further gains. Source: Coingecko Understanding DOGE’s Ascending Trendline An ascending trendline is essential for traders and analysts as it helps them visualize an asset’s market sentiment and potential price levels. When the asset price approaches the ascending trendline, it indicates a likely level of support, and if the price breaks above the trendline, it suggests an uptrend resumption. With sustained buying pressure, DOGE buyers have the potential to re-challenge the last swing high at $0.083. A bullish breakout for DOGE above this resistance level would hint at the resumption of the uptrend, potentially pushing the meme-inspired cryptocurrency’s market value higher by 21.7% to reach $0.095. As of today, the market cap of Dogecoin reached $11.1 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Positive Indicators On Dogecoin Daily Chart Meanwhile, several indicators signal bullish momentum, as a recent price analysis notes. The Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Ribbon, a cluster of EMAs that smooth out price data, displayed a bullish crossover, further reinforcing the upward momentum. Moreover, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator showed that the bulls have the upperhand, a sign that an upward trend may be in the pipeline. DOGE’s Money Flow Index (MFI), which measures money flow into or out of an asset, also increased. This development is favorable for buyers as it suggests that more capital is entering the DOGE market, supporting its recent price gains. Dogecoin price action in the last week.

The firm has emerged as the premier platform to secure the highly coveted accreditation from Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA). Binance Is Blazing The Trail In The Cryptocurrency Ecosystem Last year, Binance was granted a Provincial License by Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), enabling it to establish domestic bank accounts to preserve clients’ funds, offer custody and payment services, and run a crypto exchange. Related Reading: Here’s How Long The Majority Of New Ethereum Wallets Are Used Before They’re Dumped However, the newly acquired Operational MVP license allows the crypto exchange to legally conduct two more activities which are virtual asset broker-dealer services and virtual asset exchange services. Although these activities are only limited to qualified institutional and retail investors. Obtaining the Operational MVP license is not only an outstanding milestone but evidence of Binance’s dedication to becoming a regulatory-compliant exchange platform. According to the firm, they are working with local regulators to ensure that their operations are designed to meet the country’s unique framework for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs). BNB price recovers to $243 | Source: BNBUSD on Tradingview.com Improving Service Delivery and Ensuring Security In recent years, the United Arab Emirates has emerged as the bastion of blockchain technology, building an ecosystem that allows innovation and security to thrive alongside the other. The pivot from Provisional to Operational MVP license will provide users in Dubai with improved access to services. Participants can now convert their virtual assets to fiat currency by following the guidelines laid down by VARA. Institutions and individuals who are eligible for these services can utilize the market assurance standards and protections crafted especially for the virtual asset sector. According to Binance, the license signifies the creation of the first fully regulated exchange in Dubai after meeting the compliance requirements of FATF, thereby establishing the framework for unwavering user assurance and global growth. Related Reading: Court Filing Suggests FTX’s $2 Billion Lawsuit Against Genesis Is Coming To An End The licensing procedure in Dubai is a four-stage process, and with the recent license granted to Binance, it means the platform has now cleared three of these stages. The only outstanding license is the Full Market Product (FMP), however; this is expected to be granted after the latest demonstration of compliance with all the rules of VARA. This recent win comes as Binance prepares to re-enter Japan amidst regulatory challenges with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission this year.

42392856,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgCmVZ,1690804800,Bullish MicroStrategy Analysts Raise Price Targets Ahead of Q2 Earnings,"TD Cowen’s analyst initiated his coverage of MSTR with a price target of $520 for year’s end, praising the company for its “hybrid corporate strategy.”  Berenberg raised its price target to $510 recently, citing improving prospects for institutional adoption of bitcoin.  Analysts are bullish on software company MicroStrategy (MSTR), which reports earnings for the second quarter after the market close on Tuesday, and it’s all thanks to the many bitcoin (BTC) it holds.  TD Cowen analyst Lance Vitanza, who initiated coverage on the Michael Saylor-led firm last Wednesday with an outperform rating, praised the company for its “hybrid corporate strategy.” MicroStrategy is known for converting all of its earnings from its core software intelligence business into bitcoin. This approach represents a “paradigm shift,” he wrote in a note to investors.  ""This is not a short-term trading strategy but rather reflects a belief that ultimately, bitcoin will prove a superior store of value relative to metals and fiat currencies,"" Vitanza wrote. ""We see MicroStrategy as an attractive vehicle for investors looking to gain bitcoin exposure.""  TD Cowen’s price target for MSTR is $520 for year’s end. MicroStrategy is currently trading at around $435, up 207% so far this year.  As of July 28, the company owned an estimated 152,333 bitcoins worth roughly $4.5 billion, having most recently acquired 12,333 bitcoin for $347 million in cash between April 29 and June 27. Bitcoin is currently trading at $29,293, up about 77% year-to-date, according to CoinDesk data.  With bitcoin’s big rally this year, MicroStrategy’s impairment loss on its digital assets narrowed to $18.9 million in the first quarter, down from the fourth quarter's impairment loss of $197.6 million.  For the upcoming earnings report on Tuesday, TD Cowen estimates revenue to be $127.9 million, which would be a 5% increase from the first quarter.  Meanwhile, German investment bank Berenberg, which has a buy rating for MSTR, also raised its price target to $510 from $412.30 on July 12 in a note written by analyst Mark Palmer.  Palmer’s optimistic view is based on the “faster-than-expected pace at which MSTR has acquired bitcoins since we initiated coverage of the company on April 27, as well our view that the prospects for institutional adoption of bitcoin have improved meaningfully in the interim.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/31/bullish-microstrategy-analysts-raise-price-targets-ahead-of-q2-earnings,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/14fad6c449f798d1e2cb6d3166482f6dd361d756-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Binance said the services are currently limited to institutional and qualified retail investors. The exchange secured a provisional MVP license in March 2022 and a preparatory MVP license in September 2022. The exchange’s progression from a Provisional License to an Operational License allows eligible users in the country “to access authorized services, including the ability to safely convert virtual assets to fiat under VARA-designated standards compliant with the intergovernmental Financial Action Task Force.” Head of Regional Markets at Binance, Richard Teng, said: “We are honored to be the first exchange to be granted an operational Minimum Viable Product License by VARA — a result of over a year of due diligence, collaboration, and consistent demonstration of responsible intent – that now allows us to be able to leverage the potential of a progressive regulatory framework, enabling innovation while furthering user protection.” Adding, “Operating within this regulated ecosystem, we are committed to ensuring secure and seamless customer migration, with robust Know-Your-Customer and Customer-Due-Diligence as part of the rigorous onboarding remediation as stipulated by VARA. Our priority is to be able to operate this first fully regulated exchange in, and from Dubai, in a FATF-compliant ecosystem, setting the stage for global scalability with uncompromised user assurance.” Binance Looks to UAE for Future Prospects Last month, the exchange said it was considering a move to Dubai as it continues its struggles with the US SEC.

Investors will be looking for continued signs of a cooling employment market and slowing growth, which would suggest inflation is waning and possibly buoy risk-on asset markets, although cryptos have been largely immune from significant macroeconomic events. Hot jobs data, which typically accompanies rising prices, has been a particular concern for the U.S. central bank, which raised the interest rate 25 basis points (bps) last Wednesday.  Recent productivity and consumer spending reports have been more encouraging. Friday’s 3% Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) was lower than expectations and down from 6.8% a year ago.  Among other releases, the Labor Department and Institute for Supply Management (ISM) will announce June job openings and labor turnover (JOLTS) and manufacturing index (PMI), respectively on Tuesday; ADP will report on private sector jobs on Wednesday and the Labor Department will present initial jobless claims and on Thursday. The same day, Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) report their latest earnings.  JOLTS, ISM Manufacturing  May’s 9.8 million job openings was a decline from the 10.3 million openings in April, but not as much as some jobs observers had hoped. The ISM median forecast is for a slight uptick in manufacturing activity from 46% in June to 46.9%. The increase would be the first after seven consecutive monthly declines.  ADP Private Sector Jobs  Payroll processing firm ADP’s monthly reports on private sector jobs are a key indicator of the state of the employment market. The July report is expected to show an increase of 173,000 jobs, down from June’s unexpectedly high 497,000 jobs, which was more than double estimates and offered perhaps the most compelling reason for the U.S. central bank to boost the interest rate.  Jobless Claims, Non-Farm Payrolls  First-time jobless claims have disappointed employment observers looking for signs of a weakening job market this month. They have fallen every week in July with the 221,000 for the week ending July 22 falling about 7,000 short of the previous week’s total.  The consensus for the week ending July 29 is for a slight rise to $227,000.  Amazon, Apple Report Earnings  Encouraging earnings by a number of tech firms buoyed major equity indexes.

However, the trading cards are still NFTs and are still transacted on the blockchain.  Web3 fantasy-sports company Sorare now supports fiat payments for its digital trading cards, removing the requirement for users to pay in ether (ETH) and eliminating what the company called ""one of the main barriers to entry.""  Sorare is a blockchain-based game that allows users, called managers, to buy and trade non-fungible tokens (NFTs) representing elite sports players to build teams that they enter into competitions. The platform is licensed by some of the world's biggest sports leagues, including Major League Baseball (MLB), the National Basketball Association (NBA) and soccer's Premier League, La Liga and the Bundesliga.  While Sorare has over 5 million registered managers, it may now see the association with crypto as a hindrance to further growth and has introduced support for the U.S. dollar, the euro and the British pound. The move follows that of fellow NFT-related sports game NBA Top Shot, which accepts U.S. dollars.  As well as trying to spur user growth, the platforms may be trying to water down their association with cryptocurrency owing to lingering negative connotations due to events of the last year or so, such as the crypto market's collapse and crypto exchange FTX's dramatic implosion in November.  Removing the obligation to pay in ETH on the platform ""eliminates one of the main barriers to entry and makes it easier than ever for existing and new Managers to experience its fantasy sports game and marketplace,"" Sorare said in an emailed announcement on Monday.  An uptick in the use of Sorare may nevertheless have a positive effect on the broader adoption of digital assets and decentralized technology because the trading cards are still NFTs and the transactions are still recorded on the blockchain.

15485291,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/crypto-still-here-despite-everything,1690801075,Crypto still here despite everything,"Who would have thought it? Crypto has now suffered harsh crackdowns from both the major world superpowers and is still undergoing increased adoption. An adapting Chinese crypto strategy First it was China. A huge and sprawling country with a very centralised government overseen by its paramount leader Xi Jinping who controls both the Chinese Communist Party and the People’s Liberation Army, and just about everything else. China has been at the forefront internationally of those countries that are looking to implement a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Such a move, allied to China’s social scoring system would likely give Jinping and his central bank unrivalled power and control over Chinese citizens. Therefore, private digital assets such as cryptocurrencies are complete anathema to such a plan. There followed a complete ban on trading of cryptocurrencies and a ban on crypto mining was imposed across China. However, China has implemented such bans before, and despite causing an initial large drop in the Bitcoin hash rate, as many of the Chinese Bitcoin miners came off line, much of the hash rate has since returned as the miners set up shop again in other more welcoming countries. Further to Chinese embarrassment, the hash rate has increased again in China itself, leading it to become the 3rd largest contributor to the Bitcoin hash rate worldwide. On top of this, the Chinese government appears to have had a change of heart as regards crypto, perhaps realising that this technology could have a much greater impact on the world as it continues to mature. Still not happy with allowing crypto to have its head within the mainland borders, China looks to have nominated Hong Kong as its offshore sandbox, giving it the luxury of watching developments as Hong Kong strives to become a fully regulated crypto hub and attracts crypto companies that might have gone instead to competing Asian crypto hubs such as Dubai and Singapore. US fast becoming the most repressive regime for crypto Meanwhile in the West, the United States, once the home of business and the entrepreneurial heartland of the globe, is very much following in the footsteps of China, without even the testing ground of an offshore territory such as Hong Kong. It might appear that Gary Gensler, the head of the SEC, the regulatory watchdog of the US for securities, has been tasked by the government with systematically destroying the crypto industry in the United States. Given that the US has managed to achieve complete financial hegemony over the rest of the world by the use of the dollar as the global reserve currency, private digital assets such as cryptocurrencies are probably being seen as a threat to this domination. However, the US should be the first country to realise that no individual, regulatory body, or government, can do more than impede the progress of a new technology for any length of time. Technology cannot be repressed for long, and if it is truly innovative and ground-breaking, as is the case with blockchain and cryptocurrencies, it will always win out. Therefore, the SEC’s attacks on crypto exchanges such as Coinbase, which have done their level best to follow the misty and obscure road of compliance, would appear to be the height of folly. The US might be attempting to go the route of much greater control and centralisation, but it still happens to be the land of the free, even though the sands of time might be running down for that particular ideal, so it is not difficult for business leaders to see what is really happening as the regulatory agencies go far beyond their remit in order to attack and suppress the crypto industry in the US. Crypto adoption marches on Be that as it may, crypto marches onwards and upwards. Wallet holders of Bitcoin increased by 40% even during the bear market, and if the US succeeds in driving crypto companies from its shores, jurisdictions in Europe (UK, and France) and Asia (Dubai, Hong Kong, and Singapore) among others, are waiting to take up the slack. The battle is also not over in the US. The entrance of the largest asset management company in the world (Blackrock) into the Spot Bitcoin EFT space, will now make the battle for crypto even more interesting going forward. Fast-depreciating fiat currencies are an unpalatable fact for all citizens of the world. A store of value (Bitcoin), and a potential solution to debasing fiat currencies (crypto) are becoming widely adopted. Will central bank-influenced governments be able to stop them?

The reason: a controversial request from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) prior to the lawsuit against Coinbase. The SEC’s demand? That Coinbase halts trading in all cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin. Brian Armstrong, Coinbase’s CEO, revealed the SEC’s absurd request in an exclusive interview with the Financial Times. “They came back to us, and they said . . . we believe every asset other than Bitcoin is a security,” Armstrong said. “And, we said, well how are you coming to that conclusion, because that’s not our interpretation of the law. Remarkably, the SEC answered, “we’re not going to explain it to you, you need to delist every asset other than Bitcoin.” SEC Wanted To End The Entire US Crypto Industry This unprecedented move by the SEC indicates an intent to assert regulatory authority over the entire altcoin market. The SEC’s case against Coinbase identified 13 traded cryptocurrencies as securities, asserting that by offering them to customers, the exchange fell under the regulator’s remit. Related Reading: Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Turns Red, US Institutions Disinterested? However, the SEC’s request for Coinbase to delist over 200 tokens suggests a push for even wider authority over the crypto industry under the chairmanship of Gary Gensler. Armstrong was quick to point out the potential implications of such a move. “If Coinbase had agreed, that could have set a precedent that would have left the vast majority of the American crypto businesses operating outside the law unless they registered with the commission,” he said. The CEO further added, “We really didn’t have a choice at that point, delisting every asset other than Bitcoin, which by the way is not what the law says, would have essentially meant the end of the crypto industry in the US.” Coinbase (COIN) Plunges Following The News In the wake of the news, the Coinbase share price (COIN) plummeted in an initial reaction by more than 10%, from $102.35 to $91.94. However, at press time, the price recovered somewhat and traded at $94.76. Related Reading: Coinbase Exchange Tells Borrowers That They Have Four Months To Pay Back The news may have been a shock for COIN investors, as the statement by Brian Armstrong reveals that the approach by the SEC is even harder and worse for the crypto industry (by naming all cryptocurrencies except BTC a security) However, it’s important to note that it won’t have any impact on the SEC-Coinbase lawsuit directly. Thus, it’s possible that this was an overreaction of the market. It’s also worth noting that the upward trend in COIN’s 1-day chart remains intact. The price has bounced upwards off the support level at $91.87.

15484657,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545148,1690799423,The Litecoin $95 Question: Is A Bullish Breakout In The Pipeline?,"Litecoin (LTC) is facing a critical juncture in its price surge, with its value hovering just above $89.52 on CoinGecko, showcasing a modest 0.3% increase in the last 24 hours. However, LTC has endured a slump of 3.6% over the past seven days. As the price continues to hover below the crucial resistance level of $95, investors are wondering if the muted performance of Bitcoin (BTC) will hinder LTC’s upward trajectory. Furthermore, all eyes are on the upcoming August halving event to determine if it will catalyze significant price action. Source: Coingecko Understanding Litecoin Halving In the context of cryptocurrencies like Litecoin, a halving is a programmed event that occurs when a specific number of blocks are mined on the blockchain. Litecoin, similar to Bitcoin, has a fixed supply cap and new coins are introduced into the market through mining. Related Reading: Traders’ Interest In XRP Remains Solid Despite Price Retreat, Data Shows Source: Admiral Markets Approximately every four years, the mining reward for each block is cut in half, reducing the rate at which new coins enter circulation. This process is known as “halving” and is intended to control inflation by gradually limiting the supply of new coins. LTC’s price surge beyond $95 has encountered significant resistance, as this level had previously acted as support in early July. However, as BTC’s performance weakened, the support flipped to resistance, creating an obstacle to Litecoin’s advancement. The fate of LTC’s price action remains closely intertwined with Bitcoin’s performance, as the latter serves as a bellwether for the broader cryptocurrency market. Impact Of BTC’s Performance Being the most dominant and influential cryptocurrency, Bitcoin often dictates the market’s direction. If BTC remains weak, with its price currently at $29,414 at CoinGecko, Litecoin’s ability to break past the immediate $95 resistance level could be hindered. LTC market cap currently at $6.89 billion on the daily chart: TradingView.com A retest of the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $88 might be possible in such a scenario. On the other hand, a solid and decisive move by Bitcoin could have a positive knock-on effect on Litecoin, propelling it past the resistance and potentially sparking a more significant price rally. Related Reading: Shibarium Hype: Shiba Inu Whales Boost Appetite, Snag 1 Trillion SHIB Tokens As the Litecoin halving approaches, investors are speculating whether this event will drive a significant price surge. Historically, halvings have been associated with bull markets in cryptocurrencies, as the reduced supply of new coins can create a supply-demand imbalance, leading to higher prices. However, it’s essential to recognize that the market’s sentiment, overall health, and broader macroeconomic factors also play crucial roles in determining price movements.

Among the most notable is the sudden movement from a participant in Ethereum’s initial coin offering (ICO), who, after a roughly eight-year slumber, has sprung into action due to a reason. The Ethereum ICO participant, whose address remained inactive for 2,922 days, stirred up by transferring 641 ether, an amount currently valued at nearly $1.2 million. An Unexpected Move In The Ethereum Ecosystem The intent behind these transactions was revealed through on-chain analytics X (Twitter) account Lookonchain, noting that the Ethereum ICO participant had moved the funds to stake them. This reason has raised speculation among the crypto community as some suggest that the whale behind this move might know something they don’t. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Recovery Could Soon Fade If ETH Fails To Surpass $1,900 An Ethereum ICO participant woke up after 8 years of dormancy, transferred 641 $ETH out, and started staking. He received 2K $ETH($3.7M currently) at Ethereum Genesis, the ETH ICO price is ~$0.31.https://t.co/hGoCb22LVr pic.twitter.com/ZO09r9uFMd — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 31, 2023 Just over eight years ago, the same address received exactly 2,000 ETH from Ethereum’s Genesis. This amount of ETH at the time was worth $620 as the Ethereum network arranged an exceptional sale event then that made ETH sell for $0.31 per ETH. This event was before the network commenced its own token generation, providing a platform for early participants and co-founders to accrue pre-mined ETH. However, fast forward to nearly a decade later today, this same amount of 2,000 ETH is currently valued at over $3.72 million, showcasing the meteoric rise in the value of ETH since its inception. Notably, the awakening of this long-dormant Ethereum participant is not an isolated incident. It falls into a recent trend, observed over the summer, where several early ICO participants have begun transferring their ETH holdings. ICO Participants Stirring After A Long Hiatus This pattern of dormant Ethereum ICO participants springing into action isn’t new. Two weeks prior to the latest transaction, a pre-mined stash of Ethereum, which had been lying dormant for nearly eight years, was abruptly moved. At current rates, this stash is estimated to be worth more than $100 million. Related Reading: Pre-Mined Ethereum Worth $116M Moves After 8 Years: Is A Major Price Dip Imminent? This particular ‘whale’ move grabbed the attention of the crypto community, stirring speculation and interest in equal measure. Interestingly, the motives behind this transfer remain largely unknown, adding an element of mystery to the whale movement. Regardless of these ICO participants’ movement on the blockchain, Ethereum has seen a continuous downtrend in the past few weeks. Particularly, the asset is currently down by 3.2% in the past 14 days. ETH has declined from a high of trading above $1,900 to a trading price of $1,866, at the time of writing.

""They said... we believe every asset other than bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is a security,"" Armstrong told FT. ""And we said, that's not our interpretation of the law."" He said the SEC refused to explain its rationale for the request, but it asserted that every crypto other than bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) needs to delisted. ""Delisting every asset other than BTC, which by the way is not what the law says, would've essentially meant the end of the crypto industry in the U.S.,"" said Armstrong. ""It kind of made it an easy choice... let's go to court and find out what the court says."" The SEC said its enforcement division didn't formally request companies to delist cryptos. ""In the course of an investigation, the staff may share its own view as to what conduct may raise questions for the commission under the securities laws."" The regulator had sued Coinbase ( COIN ) for allegedly operating as an unregistered securities broker . Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, was also sued for allegedly violating securities regulations .

15483893,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/australia-crypto-maverick-the-enigmatic-journey-of-russell-wilson,1690797468,Australia's Crypto Maverick: The Enigmatic Journey of Russell Wilson,"Ozzy entrepreneur takes his crypto exchange to incredible heights despite huge scam. Impressive figures In the often crazy world of cryptocurrency, few stories are as intriguing as that of Russell Ty Wilson, the Australian crypto magnate who, from a modest office adjacent to a pilates studio and massage therapist, amassed a fortune. Over the past two years, Wilson, 42, has garnered a staggering $538 million from dividends through his CoinSpot Bitcoin exchange, as revealed by company documents. According to the British-based Mail Online, CoinSpot's financial performance has been nothing short of impressive. In 2022, the company reported profits of $292 million from a revenue of $503 million. This came on the heels of an even more prosperous year in 2021, where profits touched $334 million. Such robust returns enabled the company to distribute dividends totaling $699 million over these two years. However, things weren’t always plain sailing. In 2018, CoinSpot suffered from an exploit that resulted in a loss of $37 million. Yet, the company's resilience shone through, and it continued to thrive. Unassuming and understated Wilson's business acumen is evident in his majority ownership of CoinSpot. Holding 77% of the company through Casey Block Services, he's likely to secure a coveted spot on Australia's Rich List. But what's truly fascinating is the juxtaposition of CoinSpot's immense success and its unassuming headquarters in Windsor, Melbourne, nestled between a pilates studio and a massage therapist. Away from the glitz of Melbourne's central business district, Wilson's personal life is equally understated. Residing in a four-bedroom house in Berwick, which he purchased in 2014 for $586,500, Wilson seems to prefer a life away from the limelight. This preference for privacy extends to his business dealings as well. When CoinSpot inked a sponsorship deal with the AFL club Western Bulldogs, it was an executive, not Wilson, who made the announcement. Wilson tracks down the thieves CoinSpot's success story isn't just about numbers. It's also about resilience and innovation. In 2018, the company was targeted by a scam orchestrated by James Parker, who exploited a system glitch to syphon off $37 million. Undeterred, Wilson personally tracked down the culprits when local authorities were hesitant to intervene. This episode, while a setback, showcased Wilson's determination and commitment to his venture. Today, CoinSpot stands tall as one of Australia's leading crypto platforms, boasting over 2.5 million customers and trading in 400 different cryptocurrencies. The fact that the exchange has continued to grow, especially during the pandemic-induced lockdowns, would point to its team getting things right in the face of a harsh bear market and more difficult times from a regulatory perspective. However, owner Wilson remains an enigma. The former IT consultant, despite his immense wealth and the success of CoinSpot, shies away from public appearances. The only known photograph of him is from a company blog post from 2016. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Curve, widely regarded as the backbone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, fell victim to a reentrancy attack that risked $100 million worth of digital assets. In a knee-jerk reaction, CRV's dollar-denominated price tanked over 15%, threatening liquidation of a significant borrowed position on Aave and raising the risk of market-wide contagion.  However, CRV's price denominated in Korean won (KRW,) rose sharply. At press time, Bithumb's CRV/KRW pair changed hands at KRW 5,565 ($4.36), up more than 500% for the day, according to charting platform TradingView.  CoinDesk reached out to Bithumb, seeking information on the increased price volatility.  Per Bithumb's local rival Upbit, some of Curve's stablecoin pools were affected by the reentrancy attack, which is responsible for the volatility in CRV. Upbit suspended withdrawals and deposits of CRV to ensure the safety of digital assets transactions. At press time, the CRV/BTC pair on Upbit traded 55% higher on the day.

Base, built by crypto exchange Coinbase on OP Stack, launched its testnet in January and opened to builders in mid-July basis the submission of applications to Base. Traction was scant, so far, as only a few DEXs went live on Base.  The tides shifted late on Saturday. Crypto Twitter user @cheatcoiner seemed to first tweet about meme coin bald (BALD) – funded by coinbase staked ether (cbETH) – on Base network, stating they picked up 2% of the supply.  Such tweets are commonly known as “calls” colloquially – mostly made up of influencers hyping up tokens only to dump them on unsuspecting followers at higher prices. The use of cbETH quickly gave rise to speculative among crypto trading circles about the token likely created being issued by someone at Coinbase.  What followed was a bull market speedrun: In less than six hours, bald tokens amassed a $50 million market capitalization as their popularity picked up among trading circles. It ran up to $85 million capitalization late on Sunday - netting @cheatcoiner over $1.4 million from an initial $500 investment.  From issuance to peak, the price rise was a 4,000,000% surge.  BALD market liquidity quickly piled on as the developer of bald tokens kept adding more ether to a liquidity pool that traded bald against ether. As of Monday, the trading pair holds over $32 million in liquidity and has surpassed $100 million in volumes.  As such, @Cheatcoiner wasn’t the only lottery winner. Blockchain sleuth Lookonchain said Monday that four crypto wallet addresses transferred a cumulative 0.534 ether, or just over $1,0000, to buy 50 million BALD within 4 mins of the token’s issuance.  These addresses – likely insider wallets connected to the developer – sold 37 million $BALD for 554 ether as trading volumes picked up, netting $1 million in less than a day.  How much of these gains make their way out of Base remains to be seen, however.

The SEC said the post reiterated a June 9 warning that referred to a company called Binance Nigeria Ltd. Binance told CoinDesk at the time that the company was not affiliated with it. In Friday's notice, the SEC specifically referred to the crypto exchange's website.  ""The commission again reiterates that the activities of Binance, https://www.binance.com and any such other platform through which the company solicits investors is neither registered nor regulated by the commission and its operations in Nigeria are therefore illegal,"" the SEC said. The regulator ordered all platform providers affiliated with crypto to stop reaching out to Nigerian investors.  The SEC said last year it views all crypto as securities. The country has been processing crypto exchange applications to register on a trial basis, but will not complete registration until an agreement is reached with the central bank, which has blocked local financial institutions from interacting with crypto services providers.  The Commission also warned the public, in more general terms, ""to be wary of investing in crypto assets and other products offered or operated by entities not registered or regulated by the Commission.""

Terra had previously claimed that it had exhausted all of its reserves in an attempt to defend the UST stablecoin peg. Undisclosed Terra Wallets? Two anonymous on-chain investigators have earned Arkham Intel’s inaugural bounty after providing considerable evidence of undisclosed wallets holding more than $160 million worth of digital assets tied to Terraform Labs and its founder, Do Kwon. This effort allowed the investigators, including one who describes himself as a “glorified accountant,” to win the bounty of ARKM tokens worth around $5000. The wallets in question contain over 5200 BTC. This figure contradicts Luna Foundation Guard’s previous claims of being in possession of only 313 BTC. The foundation had, back in May 2022, stated on Twitter, “As of now, the Foundation’s remaining reserves consist of the following assets: · 313 $BTC · 39,914 $BNB · 1,973,554 $AVAX · 1,847,079,725 $UST · 222,713,007 $LUNA (of which 221,021,746 is currently staked with validators).” The revelations made by Arkham’s bounty hunters could have significant repercussions for Do Kwon. The Luna Foundation Guard’s primary mission was to maintain the dollar peg of its algorithmic stablecoin, TerraUSD (UST). The foundation relied on its reserves of Bitcoin to maintain this peg by purchasing UST from the markets as a final line of defense against UST de-pegging. However, despite its efforts, both UST and LUNA collapsed in May 2022, wiping around $40 billion in value from the markets. More Insights Expected Arkham Intel expects more insights related to the wallets in question to emerge over the next few months. However, the issuer of the bounty, in this case, Arkham, maintains exclusive rights to the information unearthed for a period of 90 days. The Terra collapse is often described as one of the most crippling events in the crypto space, triggering chaos in the markets and wiping billions in investor wealth. Terra founder Do Kwon had been on the run since the collapse but was recently apprehended in Montenegro on charges of traveling using forged documents. The arrest came after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission had accused Do Kwon and Terraform Labs of orchestrating a multi-billion dollar fraud. Arkham Intel Exchange And Privacy Concerns The Arkham Intel Exchange is hugely controversial, acting as a marketplace facilitating the trading of on-chain data. Despite the bounty, the platform has sparked considerable debate in crypto circles. Critics have flagged concerns about the potential misuse of private information by bad actors and have suggested that the platform could also facilitate the inadvertent creation of a surveillance marketplace. However, platform supporters have countered this argument, arguing that such a platform is necessary for unmasking bad actors in the crypto space and giving whistleblowers a secure avenue to disclose crucial information. Arkham Intel CEO Miguel Morel has called for a nuanced approach to the subject, stating, “You need to think [...] very carefully about what sort of information should be allowed on versus not.” The platform, launched on the 10th of July, has been described by critics as a glorified snitching service, with concerns that it could dox innocent users. Platform users can place bounties for information related to specific blockchain transactions, which would then be made available after a period of 90 days.

The court declared that XRP is not a security, leading to a significant rally in its value. However, XRP has not made significant progress toward the coveted $1 mark since the initial gains, leaving investors and market observers wondering about its future trajectory. Related Reading: Traders’ Interest In XRP Remains Solid Despite Price Retreat, Data Shows The characteristics of the larger cryptocurrency market have also hampered XRP’s development. XRP’s price swings have been impacted by the erratic nature of the cryptocurrency market and the ebb and flow of investor emotion, forcing them to fluctuate without building enough momentum to reach the coveted $1 milestone. According to a recent XRP price report based on data from TradingView, a crypto analyst who goes by the pseudonym, Juicyho, expressed doubts regarding the likelihood of a swift surge in XRP’s value. XRP Key Resistance Levels To Watch Juicyho believes that XRP might only experience a substantial rally once it finds strong support around the $0.58 level. Despite the positive impact of the court case on market sentiment, Juicyho suggests that additional factors may be at play, causing the token’s progress to stall. Source: Coingecko As of the latest data from CoinGecko, XRP is trading at $0.704, having experienced a 0.8% decline in the last 24 hours and a 3.1% slump over the past seven days. These fluctuations have left investors needing clarification about the cryptocurrency’s near-term trajectory. XRP market cap currently at $37.10 billion on the daily chart: TradingView.com In the quest for a price rebound, Juicyho highlighted crucial resistance levels to watch: $0.769, $0.785, and $0.98, with $0.785 as the most critical resistance level, based on historical price action on the yearly time frame. Breaking through and sustaining a value above $0.981 would signal a significant shift in price dynamics, potentially leaving the lower price range behind. CoinsKid’s Bullish XRP Prediction Despite the current stagnation, some analysts like CoinsKid remain optimistic about XRP’s prospects. CoinsKid pointed out on X that XRP could be forming a “double bottom” pattern, often seen as a signal of an impending upward trend after a period of decline. Related Reading: Shibarium Hype: Shiba Inu Whales Boost Appetite, Snag 1 Trillion SHIB Tokens Additionally, the analyst highlighted the formation of an ascending triangle, another bullish indicator. CoinsKid’s perspective is summed up in the trading principle, “compression leads to expansion,” indicating that XRP’s constrained trading range might eventually lead to a breakout. #xrp – breakout target new ATH.

Compression leads to expansion. pic.twitter.com/2DzOlit37H — CoinsKid (@Coins_Kid) July 30, 2023 Navigating Uncertainty Meanwhile, the court victory has undoubtedly brought positive sentiment to XRP, but the token faces challenges on its path to recovery. Analysts like Juicyho caution against hasty expectations and emphasize the importance of support levels. On the other hand, CoinsKid’s bullish outlook, based on technical patterns, keeps the optimism alive. XRP investors and traders must navigate uncertainty and exercise caution as the market evolves. Monitoring essential support and resistance levels and technical patterns will be crucial in gauging XRP’s potential breakout or further declines. Only time will tell how XRP’s price will ultimately respond to the court victory and the broader market conditions. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice.

15481095,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545118,1690790405,"XRP To Skyrocket To $500 Within 7 Months, Predicts Wells Fargo Treasury Manager","In a recent statement, Wells Fargo’s Treasury Management officer Shannon Thorp provided an eye-catching price prediction for XRP. The forward-thinking executive anticipates a potential surge in XRP’s value to anywhere between $100 and $500 in the short term, specifically within the next 4 to 7 months. This price hike prediction represents an astounding 14,200 % to 71,400% increase from the current trading value. Finding The Right Best Model Thorp acknowledges the longstanding debate within the XRP community, where one faction relies solely on chart patterns and trends exhibited by Bitcoin to draw short-term price predictions. On the other hand, another group emphasizes the significance of XRP’s utility, believing that its partnerships and the replacement of antiquated systems will be the key drivers of its price. However, Thorp presents a novel perspective, emphasizing that XRP is NOT a security and basing price forecasts on traditional securities logic is counterintuitive to the original vision set forth by the Ripple team. Related Reading: This Machine Learning Tool Was Asked To Predict XRP Price, Here’s What It Said Expanding on her rationale, Thorp introduces the concept of Liquidity Strength (LS) as a pivotal metric to consider when predicting XRP’s future value. To ascertain a price range for the token, she takes into account the total supply, including circulating tokens, burnt tokens, those owned by banks, governments, and individuals, and assumes that Ripple has released all their XRP from escrow. According to Thorp, if one company were to possess all 100 billion tokens, their Liquidity Strength (LS) in a price range of $1.00 to $5.00 would amount to $100 billion to $500 billion. However, she argues that such a calculation fails to consider the potential growth in the economy, messaging and settling activities, and the continuous benefits derived from using XRP. Drawing on real-world examples, Thorp compares the token’s potential to that of SWIFT, which handles approximately 44.8 million messages per day. Even if Ripple could capture only 30% of SWIFT’s daily value, which she approximates at $7 trillion, it would result in a staggering $2.1 trillion in daily value (roughly 13.2 million messages) for XRP. Considering XRP’s quick settlement time of 1 to 5 seconds, the liquidity would indeed be present. However, Thorp highlights the challenge of conducting large transactions with limited Liquidity Strength, as it may require a significant portion of a bank’s XRP holdings. XRP Price Prediction To arrive at her price prediction, Thorp factors in various elements such as all global banks, burnt XRP, individual holdings, XRP distributed to large banks and creators, and tokens available on liquidity hubs and exchanges. She estimates that at any given time, there may be 50 to 75 billion XRP supporting Liquidity Strength (LS). When distributed across approximately 300 to 1000 different banks, liquidity providers, and governments, this would yield around $75 million XRP/dollars for each institution. Taking into account J.P. Morgan as a top-tier bank with a daily transaction volume exceeding $8 trillion, Thorp postulates that even if Ripple captured only 10% of this market, which amounts to $800 billion, the existing 75 billion XRP in circulation would not suffice to move such massive sums efficiently. Thorp acknowledges that this estimation solely pertains to cross-border transactions and does not encompass derivatives, real estate, CBDCs, technical parallels, and NFTs. Related Reading: Traders’ Interest In XRP Remains Solid Despite Price Retreat, Data Shows With the groundwork laid, Thorp makes her price prediction, projecting XRP’s price range to be anywhere from $100 to $500 in the near short term (4 – 7 months). Her calculation is based on the Liquidity Strength (LS) scenario, where a XRP price of $100 with a supply of 50 billion XRP would yield an LS of $5 trillion, while $500 would result in an LS of $25 trillion. According to Thorp, this valuation gives the market breathing room, allows for growth, and assures that no single entity needs to hold billions of XRP to operate daily. Furthermore, Thorp believes that a potential “flip of the switch” moment could trigger this price surge – an event akin to a re-evaluation for XRP, similar to how gold is assessed. Notably, Thorp’s speculation sets an exciting stage for the future of XRP, albeit it is important to remember that her prediction is based on several assumptions that may or may not actualize. As always, those interested in investing should conduct their due diligence, consider multiple perspectives, and make informed decisions. At press time, the XRP price was at $0.7074.

15480909,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/sec-asked-coinbase-to-trade-only-in-bitcoin-before-suing-exchange,1690789860,SEC Asked Coinbase To Trade Only In Bitcoin Before Suing Exchange,"Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has revealed that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had asked Coinbase to halt all cryptocurrency trading, except that of Bitcoin. According to Armstrong, the SEC had requested this prior to suing the exchange for failing to register as a broker. Delist Every Asset Apart From Bitcoin The Coinbase CEO made the revelation in a detailed interview, stating that the Securities and Exchange Commission had made the request before suing the exchange. Armstrong added that the regulator approached the exchange, stating that they viewed every other asset apart from Bitcoin as a security and asking Coinbase to delist assets it viewed as securities. When Coinbase asked how the SEC came to that conclusion, the regulator declined to explain its interpretation of the law. Armstrong stated, “They came back to us, and they said… we believe every asset other than Bitcoin is a security. And, we said, well, how are you coming to that conclusion, because that’s not our interpretation of the law. And they said, we’re not going to explain it to you; you need to delist every asset other than Bitcoin.” According to the lawsuit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission against Coinbase, it viewed 13 assets as securities. The assets in question are Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC), Cardano (ADA), FIL, SAND, AXS, ICP, NEAR, CHZ, DASH, VGX, and NEXO. The agency also accused Coinbase of failing to register with it as a broker, clearing agency, or national securities exchange. This, according to the SEC, meant that Coinbase was dodging the disclosure regime established by the United States Congress for the US securities markets. Not Much Choice At That Point Armstrong added that the exchange did not have much choice at the time. He added that if Coinbase had followed the Securities and Exchange Commission’s instructions, it would set a wrong precedent and send out the wrong message. Coinbase accepting the SEC’s instructions would have meant that most businesses and entities in the crypto space would have been deemed to be operating outside the law unless they had registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Armstrong added that delisting every asset apart from Bitcoin would have effectively ended the crypto industry in the United States. “We really didn’t [did not] have a choice at that point; delisting every asset other than Bitcoin, which by the way, is not what the law says, would have essentially meant the end of the crypto industry in the US. It kind of made it an easy choice… let’s [let us] go to court and find out what the court says.” Ripple-SEC Case Provides Some Regulatory Clarity The crypto industry in the United States has been asking the Securities and Exchange Commission for better regulatory clarity. While the SEC has not been forthcoming, the recent SEC-Ripple case ruling brought some much-needed clarity on the subject of security and non-security. In the Ripple-SEC case, the judge ruled that XRP is not a security. The asset’s sale on exchanges, distribution to developers, sales by employees, and distribution to charities were all off the radar. However, the judge ruled that institutional sales of the XRP token were in violation of federal securities laws. After Ripple’s partial victory, many experts and industry watchers believe the ruling would benefit the Coinbase lawsuit. SEC And Coinbase: The Case So Far The Securities and Exchange Commission had sued Coinbase in June, alleging that the exchange allowed investors and traders to purchase, sell, and trade crypto asset securities. The filing stated that Coinbase merged three functions typically separated in traditional markets: clearing agencies, brokers, and exchanges. “Coinbase has never registered with the SEC as a broker, national securities exchange, or clearing agency, thus evading the disclosure regime that Congress has established for our securities markets.” The Securities and Exchange Commission filed its lawsuit against Coinbase in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. The lawsuit alleged that the exchange violated several registration provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the securities offering registration provisions included in the Securities Act of 1933. At the time, Gurbir S. Grewal, the director of the SEC’s enforcement division, had stated, “You simply can’t ignore the rules because you don’t like them or because you’d prefer different ones: the consequences for the investing public are far too great.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

15479584,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/eip-6968-set-to-enable-revenue-sharing-for-ethereum,1690786800,EIP-6968 Set To Enable Revenue Sharing For Ethereum,"An Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP), dubbed EIP-6968, has been proposed by Ethereum developers to facilitate decentralized application (dApp) creators to earn a share of transaction fees generated on Layer 2 (L2). On the outset, EIP-6968 aims to introduce a new type of token, the ""Contract Secured Revenue"" (CSR), which would allow developers to claim a percentage of transaction fees generated when users interact with their smart contracts. Kevin Owocki, one of the co-authors of the proposal, envisages this development as an opportunity for projects to band together, form an L2 around shared ideas, and share sequencer fee revenue based on who drives the most usage. Mechanism and Scaling Layer 2 solutions play a crucial role in enhancing the scalability of the Ethereum network. By conducting transactions off the main Ethereum blockchain (Layer 1 or L1), they mitigate network congestion and reduce transaction costs, whhich can skyrocket during peak periods. Layer 2 solutions use various methods like state channels, sidechains, and rollups, enabling faster and more efficient transaction processing. They significantly boost the tranbsaction throughput, thereby facilitating a smoother, more scalable experience for users and developers. In terms of the relation between L2s and the EIP-6968 proposal, the former allows smart contract developers to tap into potentially lucrative revenue streams. By introducing the concept of ""Contract Secured Revenue"" (CSR), Layer 2 can incentivize developers to create and deploy their dApps on these networks, fostering innovation and community growth. It creates a positive feedback loop - the more a developer's smart contracts are used, the more transaction fees they can potentially earn. This not only motivates developers but also accelerates the overall development and scaling of the Ethereum ecosystem. Adoption and Potential Impact The revenue generated from CSR could be utilized for multiple purposes, such as funding dApp development, public goods, or incentivizing developers to join a network. While Owocki initially proposed EIP-6968 in May, it has garnered increased attention following his presentation at the recent EthCC conference in Paris. EIP-6968 promises to revolutionize the fiercely competitive Ethereum scaling sector by introducing a novel type of incentive for developers. The proposal posits using protocol rewards of L1 to fund smart contract development, a significant change from what is the current state of market mechanisms in place. EIP-6968, viewed as a step ahead from app-chains, is designed to enable ""ecosystem-chains"" that host multiple decentralized applications. It is essentially a modified version of EIP-1559, which implemented Ethereum’s burn mechanism back in August 2021. The proposed upgrade could be adopted by any network that uses EIP-1559. Owocki expressed optimism about the potential traction within the L2 ecosystem, predicting a beneficial cycle where smart contract developers receive revenue for the value they contribute to L2s.

The coin is technically under pressure, declining from its peaks of around $31,800 recorded in early July 2023. Amid this development, on-chain data reveals that the Bitcoin miner reserve has been increasing, notwithstanding prevailing market conditions, bouncing back from May 2023 lows. According to data from CryptoQuant, the BTC miner reserve stands at 1.841 million as of July 30, up from 1.826 million on May 27. Bitcoin Miner Reserve Rising The increasing BTC miner reserve and relatively stable and steady coin prices suggest a sense of optimism among miners. This could improve sentiment and confidence among miners, possibly boosting prices and preventing sellers from pressing the coin even lower. Presently, as mentioned earlier, BTC is trending below $30,000. In crypto, the Bitcoin miner reserve measures all BTC in the hands of all miners and mining pools. It shows the total number of BTC that is yet to be liquidated. Price-wise, this is important. Miners frequently sell their coins to cover operational costs and realize profits. Therefore, trackers often monitor their trading patterns for valuable insights into market sentiment. Related Reading: Shibarium Hype: Shiba Inu Whales Boost Appetite, Snag 1 Trillion SHIB Tokens Bitcoin miner reserve trends are important for traders. However, other critical factors could influence prices in future sessions, some of which might have adverse effects. One key consideration is how different countries decide to regulate cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, as their move can impact liquidity and investor perception. Regulation, Energy Consumption Criticism Negative For Prices In the United States, for instance, the approval or rejection of a Bitcoin Spot ETF by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could significantly affect Bitcoin’s price in the months ahead. The approval of a Bitcoin ETF would enable institutional players to include Bitcoin in their portfolios, injecting capital into the crypto markets and potentially increasing liquidity. Currently, Grayscale’s GBTC, a close-ended trust, allows institutions to get exposure to Bitcoin without directly buying BTC.

The largest cryptocurrency by market value slid roughly 1% a high earlier Monday and was hovering near the lower bound of its recent tight trading range roughly between $29,000 and $29,500, and down 0.6% over the past 24 hours. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) was faring a bit worse, down just over 1%. Ether (ETH), the second-largest crypto by market capitalization, was lower by about 1% to $1,858, according to CoinDesk data.  See more: Get professional-grade crypto data and news at CoinDeskMarkets.com  Smaller cryptocurrencies underperformed the CMI's 1% decline, which tracks the performance of a broad basket of tokens, though dominated by BTC and ETH. The native tokens of layer 1 blockchain Solana (SOL), Tron (TRX) and Avalanche (AVAX) each sunk 3-4%.  Putting DeFi tokens under particular pressure was yesterday's exploit against Curve Finance, where an attacker siphoned more than $50 million of assets from the key DeFi exchange. The protocol's CRV governance token was down 10% over the last 24 hours to 55 cents, while Curve-adjacent Convex Finance's CVX dropped 10.6%. Other large DeFi tokens also struggled, with AAVE, Compound's CMP and Maker's MKR losing between 5% and 11%.  HEX tumbled 18% during the day on the news that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued controversial crypto founder Richard Heart and his projects Hex, PulseChain and PulseX for raising over a $1 billion by offering unregistered securities.  BTC accumulation season  In a recent market update note, Singapore-based QCP Capital said this is the season of accumulators.  ""Despite BTC and ETH's indifferent response to macroeconomic factors and their current sideways trading, the market anticipates a rise in volatility and a possible significant BTC price increase by year's end due to factors like the Blackrock spot ETF ruling and the Bitcoin Halving, with Accumulators emerging as an effective strategy for accredited investors to acquire coins at discounted prices steadily,"" they wrote.  Elsewhere, Galaxy Digital’s Mike Novogratz recently said in an interview with Bloomberg that “the most important thing that happened this year in Bitcoin is Larry Fink,” emphasizing his boosted bullishness about the world’s largest digital currency following the asset management giant's spot bitcoin ETF filing.  “Larry was a nonbeliever,"" said Novogratz. ""Now he says, ‘Hey, this is going to be a global currency.’ People around the world all trust it,” Novogratz added, while also mentioning that Galaxy Digital is committed to maintaining a presence in New York.  Novogratz also said that his ideal portfolio for a young person with risk tolerance is shares of Alibaba, silver, gold, bitcoin, and ether.  Meanwhile, Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, said bitcoin’s ability to shrug off macroeconomic events, or even material technical events like the Curve Finance exploit, has created a recent “sustained sentiment shift” to the upside in the markets.  “Notably, now that the Fed's interest rate hike is also priced, the fact that Bitcoin and ETH have both maintained their price levels, should give bulls additional confidence,” DiPasquale wrote in a note to CoinDesk.  While not expecting “an overnight surge in the market,” DiPasquale sees 2024’s halving as the next major price spur. “Until then, bulls will do well to accumulate when opportune and bears may want to practice vigilant risk management,” he wrote.  Macro headwinds from Japan  The Bank of Japan (BOJ) last week softened its grip on the country's bond market, suggesting it would let yields rise beyond the tight 50 basis point limit it had previously set.. The yield on the 10-year Japanese Government Bond quickly rose to 55 basis points on the news and last night threatened to spike even higher, forcing the BOJ to intervene to temporarily cap the yield at 60 basis points.  The maneuver can potentially have wide-ranging impact on global markets and liquidity, including on the cryptocurrency asset class, which tend to be sensitive to global liquidity conditions, CoinDesk reported.  ""The move is seen as a sign that the BOJ is preparing to put an end to its 30 year-long monetary policy easing which could have a significant impact on global liquidity,"" digital asset market research firm Kaiko noted in a Monday report.

Funding rates in perpetual futures tied to UNI have surged to an annualized 19% in the wake of the exploit, according to data tracked by crypto services provider Matrixport.  A positive funding rate means the perpetual contract's price is trading at a premium to the mark price or the estimated true value of a contract, also known as ""marking-to-market."" Positive rates also indicate longs or traders holding leveraged buy positions are dominating and willing to pay funding to shorts to keep their positions open.  ""The UNI token [perpetuals] trades at a nearly 20% premium as traders expect Uniswap to gain even more market share after the CRV exploit,"" Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at Matrixport, said in an email.  Late Sunday, Curve, the third-largest DEX, fell victim to a flash loan exploit that put $100 million worth of cryptocurrency at risk. Curve DAO's native CRV token fell over 15% to $0.63 following the attack. The quick decline introduced additional risk, potentially threatening to liquidate $70 million worth of borrowed position of Curve founder.  Still, the perpetual futures market indicates no signs of panic, with funding rates in CRV and AAVE markets holding above zero.  ""CRV DAO perp futures are still trading at a small premium, indicating that traders are more focused on moving positions away from the DEX (regarding TVL) rather than shorting the token,"" Thielen said.  The total value locked (TVL) locked in Curve Finance fell from $3.2 billion to $1.8 billion following the hack, according to data source DeFiLlama. Meanwhile, the TVL locked in Uniswap has held steady at around $3.8 billion while AAVE's has declined from $5.85 billion to $5.37 billion.",POSITIVE,AAVE | CRV | UNI,AAVE | CRV | MARKET | TRADING | UNI,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/31/crypto-futures-show-bias-for-uniswaps-uni-token-after-curve-finance-exploit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/16c8743c5efc5b36d978bdb0eff99d09f099bf49-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

15478194,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/re-entrancy-exploit-hits-curve-finance,1690783200,Re-entrancy Exploit Hits Curve Finance,"An exploit in the Curve Finance platform has put more than $100 million in cryptocurrency at risk, intensifying security concerns in Ethereum's decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Central to this exploit is a ""re-entrancy"" bug in Vyper, the programming language instrumental to Curve's system. This vulnerability has provided hackers with an avenue to drain several stablecoin pools on the platform, unsettling the pricing and liquidity of numerous DeFi services. While it's uncertain how much has been drained due to the attack, BlockSec, a blockchain auditing firm, projects the total losses to be above $42 million. Curve hosts 232 different pools. Despite this number, only those using Vyper versions 0.2.15, 0.2.16, and 0.3.0 have been identified as at risk, according to Mimaklas, a member of the Curve team. Mimaklas added: ""all affected pools have been drained or white hacked, and the team is assessing the situation with affected teams."" Echoes of Past DeFi Attacks This incident isn't a one-off in the DeFi landscape. The space has been plagued by a series of attacks in recent times. Just last year, the Ronin Network lost a staggering $622 million to hackers due to a breach in the Ethereum sidechain. BadgerDAO also fell prey to an $80 million heist, sparking widespread concerns over the security practices in the DeFi sector. Fallout: Impact on CRV Token and DeFi Sector The exploit has sent ripples across the trading markets fo Curve DAO’s native CRV token. The token's value tumbled by 17%, standing at $0.61 at press time. This price plummet could instigate a forced liquidation on Curve’s founder's $70 million borrowing position on Aave, further complicating the situation. These recurring incursions underscore the urgent need for robust security measures and rigorous audit practices within the DeFi ecosystem. As the DeFi sphere continues to expand, tackling these challenges head-on becomes increasingly crucial to protect participants' assets and uphold confidence in the system's resilience.

42392864,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgCmq5,1690779387,SEC Told Coinbase to Stop Trading in All Cryptos Except Bitcoin Before Suing: FT,"The SEC asked Coinbase to delist every cryptocurrency except bitcoin before suing the exchange.  Armstrong told the Financial Times the SEC recommendation left us no choice but to head to court.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had asked Coinbase (COIN) to stop trading in all cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin (BTC) prior to suing the crypto exchange, according to a Financial Times report, citing Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong.  “SEC staff does not ask companies to delist crypto assets. In the course of an investigation, the staff may share its own view as to what conduct may raise questions for the Commission under the securities laws,” an SEC spokesperson told CoinDesk.  SEC Chair Gary Gensler, the four SEC commissioners and SEC staff have had different opinions on matters and don't necessarily reflect the institution's position unless expressed as so.  “The interview as published earlier today by the Financial Times omitted critical context regarding our conversations with the SEC in the U.S.,"" a Coinbase spokesperson told CoinDesk in an email. ""Whether deliberately or as a result of an oversight, the author implied that the SEC ordered Coinbase to 'halt all trading of every crypto asset other than Bitcoin.' As stated by the SEC itself further in the article, its “enforcement division did not make formal requests for “companies to delist crypto assets”.  Coinbase further added that, ""the views shared in the FT article may have represented the views of some staff at the time, but did not represent those of the Commission more broadly. We continue our discussions with the Commission..""  Armstrong told FT that ""the SEC made the recommendation before launching legal action against the Nasdaq-listed company last month for failing to register as a broker,"" the report said.  On June 6, the SEC charged Coinbase with breaching federal securities law alleging that it was simultaneously operating as a broker, an exchange and a clearinghouse for unregistered securities – namely, 13 different cryptocurrencies but not bitcoin. Coinbase shot back saying the SEC's action violates due process and constitutes an abuse of discretion. Coinbase and the SEC are now embattled in a legal process, even as Ripple scored a partial victory in a case against the SEC, ruling that Ripple's XRP token is not a security.  “They came back to us, and they said . . . we believe every asset other than bitcoin is a security,” Armstrong said according to the FT. “And, we said, well how are you coming to that conclusion, because that’s not our interpretation of the law. And they said, we’re not going to explain it to you, you need to delist every asset other than bitcoin.”  Armstrong said the SEC recommendation left us no choice but to head to court.  Gensler has previously suggested that all cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin are securities. Armstrong's revelations suggest the SEC viewed Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, as a security before suing Coinbase.  FT did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for comment.

42392865,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgCn0L,1690766947,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Climbs Back to $29.4K; Crypto's Correlation With Tech May Return,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: As the trading week begins in Asia, Bitcoin and Ether are experiencing minor declines.  Insights: An exploit of stablecoin exchange Curve could threaten more than $100 million in crypto. PLUS: Russia's share of bitcoin mining rose when China banned the industry; now mining is booming in Russia.  Prices  Bitcoin Hovers Above 29K as Curve Exploit Works Its Way Through Market  As Asia opens its trading week, bitcoin is up 0.3% to $29,415, and ether is down 0.6% to $1,869.  So far, the market seems to have digested an exploit in the Curve stablecoin exchange without further contagion. As CoinDesk previously reported, a ""re-entrancy"" bug in Vyper, the programming language used in parts of Curve, put over $100 million worth of cryptocurrency at risk. Blockchain auditing firm BlockSec preliminarily estimated the total losses to be above $42 million.  Elsewhere in the market, the Chia Network’s Gene Hoffman said in a recent interview with CoinDesk that despite a decoupling between stocks and tech stocks this year, Bitcoin and tech still have the potential for correlation due to ongoing mass adoption.  “The coin usually tends to trade as if it were a tech stock. The tech earnings around are mixed to positive,” he said. “There's no real force to break things one side or the other.""  Hoffman also said he expects the market to move sideways in August due to the global vacation season but foresees a gentle move upward in all markets come September due to job support, an opening IPO market, and potential rate decreases after a final hike in the US.  Finally, last week, Markus Thielen, Matrixport’s head of research and strategy, said in an interview with CoinDesk that traders should switch from bitcoin to bullish call options due to low volatility, enabling them to lock in current gains while potentially benefiting from future upside rallies.  ""This allows locking in the year-to-date gains for bitcoin, while the call option exposure allows participating in any upside rally,"" Thielen said.

Upwards of $100 million worth of cryptocurrency are at risk due to a “re-entrancy” bug in Vyper, a programming language used to power parts of the Curve system. Several stablecoin pools on the platform — used for pricing and liquidity on a number of different DeFi services — have been drained by hackers so far. Other projects that use the Vyper programming language could share the same vulnerability. As Asia opened its trading day, it was unclear how much had been drained from Curve as a result of the attack. BlockSec, a blockchain auditing firm, estimated the total losses above $42 million in a preliminary analysis posted to Twitter. Curve's CRV token was recently trading at 62 cents, off more than 16% over the past 24 hours. It changed hands as low as 59 cents, a more than 19% decline late Sunday after the breach.  Russia's Bitcoin Mining Boom  The bitcoin mining industry in Russia is booming, and hardware manufacturers Bitmain and MicroBT are positioning themselves to reap the benefits. More machines are flowing into Russia than anywhere else in the world, Ethan Vera, chief operating officer at global mining services firm Luxor Technologies, said at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2023 festival held last month in Austin, Texas. Russia has always been a powerhouse in Bitcoin hash rate – a measure of computational power being contributed to the blockchain – thanks to the availability of cheap energy and its cold climate. Russia’s share of world mining gained as China banned the industry in 2021, making it the second- or third-largest in the world, according to one of its biggest mining firms.
