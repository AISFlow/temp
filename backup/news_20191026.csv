While China still bans cryptocurrency trading and its national digital currency is not yet hatched, cryptography, as an integral underpinning of blockchain technology, could be key to the country’s push to be more competitive in the blockchain space.  The new law aims to tackle emerging regulatory and legal challenges in commercial cryptography use-cases as they play an increasingly important role in developing the Chinese economy, according to the law's latest draft proposal prior to approval.

China’s national congress said the new law will encourage research and development on commercial cryptography technologies, while building up an inclusive standardized regulatory system for the market.

The proposal includes a range of issues from how compatible the industry standards should be with other international cryptography systems to whether companies should voluntarily verify their commercial use-cases with authorities.

42403454,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfzOl,1572086063,"Bitcoin Price Hits Five-Week High Above $10,000","Bitcoin's price was quoted in five digits across cryptocurrency exchanges earlier today, but the breakout into $10,000 was short-lived.  The number one cryptocurrency by market value jumped to $10,350 at 01:45 UTC – the highest level since Sept. 24 – according to Bitstamp data. Meanwhile, the global average price, as calculated by CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index, clocked a high of $10,332.  Just 24 hours ago, the cryptocurrency was reeling under bearish pressures below $7,500 and prominent chart analysts were calling a deeper drop, courtesy of the so-called ""death cross"" – a bearish cross of long-term moving averages.  BTC, however, picked up a bid around $7,500 in the early U.S. trading hours on Friday and rose to $8,800 at 17:20 UTC. Prices then consolidated in the narrow range of $8,500 to $8,700 for a few hours, before printing highs above $10,000 earlier today. Essentially, the death cross trapped sellers on the wrong side for the fourth time since 2014.  Biggest single-day gain since April  Bitcoin closed (UTC) at $8,662 on Friday, representing a 16.51 percent gain on the day, as per Bitstamp data. That is the biggest single-day rise since April 2. Back then, BTC had rallied 18.45 percent from $4,133 to $5,080.  Further, the rise from lows below $7,400 to highs above $10,300 is reportedly the third-largest 24-hour price gain in bitcoin's history, as pointed out by crypto-asset analyst Yassine Elmandjra.  Experts have associated the latest double-digit surge with Chinese President Xi Jinping's comments that the world's second-largest economy should accelerate its adoption of the blockchain technology. After all, China was one of the biggest sources of demand for cryptocurrencies during the 2017 bull run.  Prominent observers like Anthony Pompliano are of the opinion that the Chinese president's public support of the blockchain technology will force the U.S. and other major nations to embrace the technology, perhaps boosting bitcoin.  The investor community, therefore, is expecting the rally to continue. Some observers, however, are worried that the market optimism is premature, as China is developing a digital version of its own currency and is unlikely to lift its ban on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  It remains to be seen whether Xi's comments power further gains in BTC. The cryptocurrency is losing altitude at press time.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $9,320 on Bitstamp, representing a $1,000-plus drop from the Asian session high of $10,350. Technical charts indicate a bullish breakout would be confirmed if prices find acceptance above $9,750.  Daily chart  The daily chart shows early signs of a bullish reversal. For instance, bitcoin's convincing move above $8,352 (Oct. 21 high) has invalidated the bearish lower highs setup. The cryptocurrency has also violated resistance at $8,820 (horizontal line).  However, the cryptocurrency is yet to exit the falling channel, represented by trendlines connecting June 26 and Aug. 6 highs and July 17 and Sept. 26 lows.  A UTC close above the upper edge of the bearish channel, currently at $9,750, would imply a resumption of the rally from lows near $4,100 seen on April 2 and put the cryptocurrency on the path to re-test of the high of $13,880 hit in June.  Put simply, a channel breakout is needed to confirm a bearish-to-bullish trend change.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

The hackers then transferred Mr. Shapiro’s currency from Mr. Shapiro’s accounts into accounts that they controlled. In all, they stole more than $1.8 million from Mr. Shapiro in the two consecutive SIM swap attacks on May 16, 2018.”  The lawsuit alleged that two former AT&T employees from Tucson, Arizona, were the key to the operation. Jarrett White and Robert Jack received $4,300 and $585.25, respectively, from hackers referred to in court documents as “The Community” to feed the six-man group a stream of insider intel.  It was this backdoor that gave “The Community” access to Shapiro’s cellphone, the document said.  Shapiro said that of the $1.757 million stolen, $1 million was his and the remainder to belong to other people who were investing in crypto projects with him.  In addition to Shapiro, the thieves also swapped the SIMs of two other executives at the event, Chris Kitze and Fiorenzi Villani.  Although not mentioned in the court filing, all three executives are partners in a series of crypto PR companies and investment funds.  In fact, they are all this weekend presenting at a conference produced by the most well-known crypto swapping victim, Michael Terpin, who is also suing AT&T for a SIM heist that cost him $23.8 million, in addition to seeking $200 million in punitive damages.  Shapiro, Kitze and Terpin are members of Pro Top Company Services, in Tortola, British Virgin Islands, advertising crypto investment funds. This nine-member company mirrors a second BVI-registered organization, Alphabit Fund, with only seven members, which excludes Shapiro and another executive, their business development representative in Japan.  Villani is a partner with Terpin in the Transform GROUP public relations company, and both are organizers of the CoinAgenda conference this weekend in Las Vegas. All four presented at the event last year, though Shapiro was not included in this year's list of featured speakers.  Kitze, a serial entrepreneur with several notable dot-com era exits, was registered at the 2018 Consensus event as an executive at a blockchain company that no longer seems to be in operation.  On the day of the theft, Shapiro's VideoCoin announced the completion of a $50 million initial coin offering (ICO) entirely through private investment, rather than the typical public sale. Investors included Galaxy Investment Partners, ethereum co-founder Anthony Di Iorio, Akamai Co-Founder Randall Kaplan, Science Blockchain and Alphabit Fund.  The investigation  In his account to investigators, Shapiro said he was targeted on May 16, 2018, while attending CoinDesk’s annual Consensus conference in New York.  Shapiro said he lost cell reception and went to a Manhattan AT&T store for help, testimony collected by investigators show.  AT&T salespersons confirmed his suspicions: he had been the victim of a SIM-swapping hack, the same kind of attack that has allowed hackers to steal from other high profile figures.  Shapiro purchased a new phone and SIM card at the AT&T salesperson’s recommendation. He was already fearful, according to the civil complaint, that the hackers would get into his crypto accounts. He thought the new phone would stave off the heist.  But “The Community” and their moles inside AT&T were one step ahead of him, a chat stream collected by investigators show:  “57 COINS. In bittrex. Trying to stay calm. Rn.” said @ilvebtc in a series of successive texts to The Community group chat, titled “hehe,” on May 16 at around 2:00pm in the afternoon. @ilvebtc had breached Shapiro’s Bittrex account.  @coinmission responded: “He probably has way more in other places. He has eth.”  A wallet address mentioned in the chat shows over 1,200 ETH, worth about $500,000 at the time routed into the wallet from a Bittrex account. Three equal cuts of 441.6 ETH later flowed outbound.  Later in the exchange, @woahk, who is referred to by other members as “Joel,” notes that some unusual activity is happening on the SIM-swapped phone. “He’s trying to get number back. I’m getting text messages.”  Joel Ortiz was sentenced in April to 10 years in prison for prolific SIM swapping, becoming the first person in the country to be jailed for such an offense.  He had made off with an estimated $7.5 million across 40 hacks; Ortiz’s sentencing documents show that at least $900,000 of that came from Seth Shapiro.  AT&T told CoinDesk in a statement that it is refuting Shapiro's allegations and plans to fight them in court.
