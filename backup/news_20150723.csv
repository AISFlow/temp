42426452,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJcy1h,1437687923,Meet the Kenyan Startup Trying to Change Bill Gates' Mind on Bitcoin,"Last month, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation awarded bitcoin startup Bitsoko $100,000 to help troubleshoot Africa's now-ubiquitous mobile money systems.  The news, which followed a long application process beginning last September, came as a surprise to the team of six, not least because Bill Gates has been publicly skeptical about the future of the payment technology in the developing world.  ""They [the foundation] had not worked with any other bitcoin startups to our knowledge, so we were really not too sure if they would want to come on and us be their first,"" Daniel Bloch, Bitsoko's head of business development, told CoinDesk.  Through its Grand Challenges Explorations grant, now in its eighth year, the Gates Foundation has funded thousands of outside-the-box ideas seeking to tackle 'unsolved problems' in global health.  This year, for the first time, it's branching out into nine initiatives around mobile money – a technology that, in little under a decade, has already seen rapid adoption among the world's underbanked. While the $100,000 isn't a seal of approval per se, it does indicate the foundation is willing to give bitcoin a try, Bloch said.  ""I know that the Gates Foundation has had some events and internal debates around bitcoin, so I think because of that timing they've said 'Lets give them a grant for 18 months and see, does it work? Is it increasing the ability for merchants to accept mobile money payments, or is Bill right?'""  With the money, Bitsoko is running a year-long research study on whether its three-pronged service – a consumer wallet, a merchant processor and an API – can spur mobile money adoption in the east and west of the continent.  Currently in beta with a select number of users, it will launch officially on 25th September this year.  PayPal for mobile money  Despite the mobile money boom, and the success of projects such as Kenya's MPesa, there is one problem that persists: interoperability.  In 2013, 52 of the world's countries had more than one mobile money source – a term used to describe each telecom's 'brand' of cash. In Ghana, for example, where Bitsoko is running half of its trial, there are five main telecoms.  This variety of payment methods creates friction on both sides of the till. Due to the fees and set up costs involved, Bloch said, local merchants will typically accept only one type of mobile cash. However, consumers will still need to convert their funds from, say, AirTel to MTN, to accommodate for this when they shop, and face high fees when doing so.  Enter Bitsoko, a way to accept many currencies and cash out in just one, which Bloch described as a kind of PayPal for mobile money.  Users top-up their online wallet, they pay in the money of their choice, and – via the blockchain – the merchant receives payment in the form of currency they prefer, allowing them to leapfrog the hassle and fees involved in changing between currencies.  ""As mobile money grows, we see Bitsoko as a solution that can really help merchants lower their costs to either be equivalent or lower than existing systems and not have additional fees by having to accept more than one and go back and forth.""  While there are plans to support non-smartphone models in the future – Bitsoko is ""exploring opportunities"" with SMS wallets, Bloch said – currently the target market is the young, vibrant tech community in Nairobi, aka the Silicon Savannah.  For this reason, and for the purposes of the grant, Bitsoko will be focusing solely on bitcoin top-ups for now, though it will allow users to top-up via cash, bank transfer or mobile money in the future.  Phase two  But what does any of this have to do with health? Well, if the project can produce hard evidence that it has been successful in its mission to save merchants time and money with bitcoin, the team's plan for phase two of the grant (which can be up to $1m) will be an expansion into industry-specific payment processing for institutions such as hospitals and pharmaceutical companies.  The hard evidence it needs comes in the form of customer acquisition, retention and cost savings for the 40 merchants – 20 in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, and the other 20 in Accra, Ghana – taking part in the trial. All data will be tracked via Bitsoko's merchant analytics and customer loyalty platforms.  ""We want to offer merchants data on their store they didn't know,"" Bloch said. Bitsoko is hoping that, by using this information, companies will be able to adapt their stores to suit the needs of their customers and their business, for example optimising a menu or providing better loyalty cards.  Currently, this comes for free. However, the company is weighing the merits of a monthly payment model, versus a 0.1% transaction fee once the trial is over. If merchants choose to stick with the platform, and pay, this could improve Bitsoko's chances of receiving more funds from the foundation.  About Bitsoko  Bloch first met Bitsoko's two other founders, brothers Allan and Gibson Juma, through the Crypto College Network (CCN) which he started in January 2014 as a way to meet other students into bitcoin.  The Jumas, though not students, were working out of Kenyatta University’s incubator at the time. After discovering CCN online, they got in touch with Bloch, who helped them plan Nairobi's first bitcoin meetup last September. Bloch decided to join Bitsoko full time after his graduation.  The team has since expanded, bringing on Africa's only bitcoin core developer, Tawanda Kembo; Emmanuel Noah, who heads up business development in Ghana and Jessica Colaco, Bitsoko's head of research.  Bitsoko's home in the tech hub of Nairobi means the team have witnessed the scene's ""amazing energy"" and daily events for investors, NGOs and international corporations.  For this reason, Bloch is confident the region will see more companies like Bitsoko and remittance platform BitPesa, which raised £1.1m from US-centric investors back in February, springing up.  However, there is still some way to go: ""The main part holding back investors ... I think the scene will increase as education and collaboration increases.""  Bitsoko hopes to play a part in this, starting with a series of educational events. Its first workshop this month, which took place in the city’s iHub centre, saw over 60 developers attend. This, Bloch said, speaks to the level of interest from those looking for a way in to the industry.  Additionally, the startup has also been pleasantly surprised about the enthusiasm for the currency itself. ""We've noticed that a lot of people want bitcoin currently, and in Kenya and in Ghana there is a population that does want bitcoin and who is going to, we think, enjoy the volatility aspect,"" Bloch said.  This speaks to the fact the population has had to adjust to radical changes in payments since the rise of systems like MPesa, but not just this:  ""You have others like those we work with in Zimbabwe who in their lifetime have seen their currency collapse to valueless and so ... people see the fragility of fiat money and the need to innovate and have stronger systems.""

42426447,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJcxvh,1437682850,Fed Official Outlines Bitcoin Risks for Community Banks,"The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (FRBSF) has penned an informal advisory note to community banks highlighting the potential challenges of working with bitcoin industry firms and consumers.  Written by FRBSF director Wallace Young and published in Community Banking Connections, the note suggested blockchain-based digital currencies are ""likely here to stay"". As such, Young argued that community bank professionals should make themselves aware of the potential risks.  According to the FRBSF, these include the compliance risk, reputational risk, credit risk and operational risk of servicing both businesses that provide digital currency services and consumers who want to use such assets as collateral for other financial services.  The last scenario was perhaps the most novel of those listed, with the FRBSF advising caution, but suggesting that community banks should make case-by-case judgements.  Young wrote:  ""Caution is appropriate. Bankers should carefully weigh the pros and cons of extending any loan secured by bitcoins or other virtual currencies (in whole or in part), or where the source of loan repayment is in some way dependent on the virtual currency.""  The FRBSF went on to suggest that given the sometimes extreme fluctuations in the value of digital currencies against the US dollar, banks should strategize ways to supervise any holdings used as collateral.  ""In the event of a loan default, the bank would need to take control of the virtual currency. This will require access to the borrower’s virtual wallet and private key. All of this suggests that the loan agreement needs to be carefully crafted and that additional steps need to be taken to ensure the bank has a perfected lien on the virtual currency,"" Young continued.  Defined as banks with a maximize asset size of $1bn by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), community banks account for 95% of US banking operations. Community banks serve as the main financial services provider for rural communities in the US, serving one in five counties.  Community Banking Connections is a publication providing perspectives of the Federal Reserve staff providing supervisory guidance on challenges and concerns for these institutions.  Reputational risk  The FRBSF suggested that on the business side, community banks that provide services to digital currency firms should be aware of past incidents where such businesses have been the subject of legal scrutiny.  Named specifically was the 2014 insolvency of Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt Gox, which is estimated to have lost hundreds of millions of dollars in consumer funds.  ""Since then, multiple lawsuits have been filed against Mt Gox, with several also naming Mt Gox’s bank as a defendant,"" the note continued. ""Although the bank never held the bitcoins, it did handle Mt. Gox’s transactional banking needs. At least one of the lawsuits claims that the bank should have known about the fraud and that the bank profited from the fraud.""  As such, the note suggested that community banks weigh the risks of such customers, as well as the potential legal and financial concerns. As for the compliance risks, the FRBSF stated that digital currency firms may present risks similar to traditional money transmitters.  Here, the FRBSF addressed the perceived anonymity of digital currencies, suggesting that higher levels of due diligence and monitoring may be necessary for such firms.  ""The less-than-transparent nature of the transactions may make it more difficult for a financial institution to truly know and understand the activities of its customer and whether the customer’s activities are legal,"" the note read.  Operational risk  Also discussed was how a community bank should respond to situations where it finds itself the owner of digital currency as a result of the need to collect on debt.  ""The most likely scenario in which this could occur is when a bank makes a business loan secured by the borrower’s business assets, which at default include virtual currency. At the moment, such a scenario is unlikely, but its plausibility increases as virtual currency becomes more mainstream,"" the article read.  Given the risk of volatility, the FRBSF recommends institutions liquidate these funds ""in an orderly fashion"", suggesting internal controls would be needed to mitigate loss.  ""Management should establish dual control and access processes, as well as think about how this asset will be valued and accounted for on its financial statements,"" it continued.  Further consideration, the report suggested, would need to be given to how the digital currency is held and how it could be kept secure prior to sale.

42426443,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJcxrh,1437679294,Survey: 47% of Finance Pros Say Firms Exploring Blockchain Tech,"New data suggests that many financial professionals believe their industry is being reshaped by blockchain technology.  A survey conducted by market intelligence provider Greenwich Associates shows that a number of financial institutions are actively reviewing solutions using distributed ledgers.  Few respondents indicated that their institutions were actively deploying blockchains at this time. Seventeen percent of 92 survey-takers said that they are ""currently using"" some form of implementation. Yet more could begin utilizing the technology in the near future – of 87 respondents, 47% said that they were ""reviewing"" the option.  The survey  , entitled “Bitcoin, the Blockchain and Their Impact on Institutional Capital Markets”, included feedback from 102 individuals with focuses on areas like exchange, consulting, financial tech and buy-side and sell-side investments. The interviews were conducted in May and June.  Of those, 84% were based in the Americas, with 11% and 5% based in Europe and Asia, respectively. Many questions included in the survey only garnered data from a portion of the field.  Easing settlement pain  When asked about the problems the technology could be used to alleviate, settlement risk and time were most cited.  Respondents also indicated that counterparty risk and custodial risk could also be reduced through the use of distributed ledgers.  The data suggests that bitcoin and the blockchain are on the radar of many in financial circles. Ninety-one percent of respondents said they were aware of bitcoin, with 70% stating their familiarity with distributed ledger tech more broadly.  Little love for bitcoin  It appears that a number of respondents don't have much interest in bitcoin itself.  Fifty-six of those in the survey pool indicated more familiarity with specifics startups in the space, naming Digital Asset Holdings (27%), Ripple Labs (25%) and Coinbase (23%) over ""bitcoin"" (16%).  The report authors state that, for Wall Street, the underlying distributed ledger seems to hold the biggest draw rather than bitcoin the currency.  ""It is not Bitcoin itself that has the potential for changing the institutional capital markets, however. The blockchain, the technology that allows bitcoin to exist and be transferred safely without an intermediary, presents a much bigger opportunity for financial services firms.""

CoinCut representative Dax Chan said that the team is ""treating this as malicious"", adding that further investigation is taking place at this time.  He explained:  ""We're trying to figure out how that particular directory was made visible to the world – and how the problem leaked out so promptly given that we're a moderately small bitcoin vendor in the grand scheme of things.""

42398545,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbUpyY,1437660242,Analytics Service Aims to Be 'Gold Standard' of Bitcoin Data,"A new service is launching its invite-only beta this week with the promise of delivering the ""gold standard"" for bitcoin data.  Challenger Deep  is a platform aiming to make the bitcoin ecosystem easy to navigate for non-technical users, including investors, traders and consumers.  Entrepreneur and ad-tech veteran Pascal Gauthier, who is self-funding Challenger Deep with around $2m, said he saw a gap in the market for a one-stop service:  ""You could find some data on the blockchain, on miners, on exchanges, but all separately. Nowhere could you find a comprehensive source for bitcoin data with a website to consult and an API to extract data should you need it.""  ""Whether your job is bitcoin, advertising [or] e-commerce, every market needs an independent source for data,"" he added.  The scalable platform offers both real-time and historic data on various aspects of bitcoin, including blockchain and market data. The data is sourced from the blockchain, alongside open and private APIs. ""We are getting closer to a lot of bitcoin companies to extract more data from them,"" Gauthier added.  In the future, the seven-person team hopes to release more advanced features, including a bitcoin 'fear index' that will predict price direction and a way to compare features of different wallets and exchanges. A database of bitcoin companies is also in the works.  Following its beta, the first public version of Challenger Deep is due for release later this September. It will operate as a 'freemium' model, where basic access to its platform and APIs is free but users can opt to pay for add-on services or to avoid adverts.  The price tiers will be decided following the results of the beta, Gauthier said. Interested users can register for the beta starting today, with the first access codes being sent Tuesday next week.  Competition  Challenger Deep faces competition from a host of bitcoin data firms. Blockchain, the widely-cited source of bitcoin network data, is backed by $30.5m in VC funding.  Meanwhile, products such as Elliptic's 'Bitcoin Big Bang' and Chainalysis are looking to capture the compliance market with tailored blockchain tracking and labelling features.  Gauthier maintains his service will stand out as the only one ""with an open access to all our data resources"". Additionally, it will be built to scale.  ""As the blockchain is getting bigger, as there will be more and more exchanges and companies with data needs. We will be able to support [them] all ... in an industry that is growing more complex by the day.""  While the market for these kinds of services is still small, Challenger Deep is Gauthier's bet that it could grow and grow, and his startup with it.  ""Cryptocurrency business will be revolutionary and will grow fast in the next few years. What seems to be a small niche market today is potentially enormous in the future. So yes, we believe that, in time, the market for bitcoin-specific data will be here,"" he concluded.

42398550,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbUq1V,1437643468,6 Things You Missed from the State of Bitcoin,"Last week, CoinDesk released the latest report in our quarterly State of Bitcoin series.  Just like all our reports to date, the State of Bitcoin Q2 2015 was an all-encompassing look at the bitcoin ecosystem, clocking in at just shy of 100 slides of data.  It was the first positive quarter for bitcoin since this time last year, characterised by increased attention amidst the Greek crisis and interest from banks and governments in blockchain technology.  However, these weren't the only takeaways from Q2. Here, we've put together a few hidden gems from the report you might have missed.  1. Bitcoin is on track to outpace the Internet  Bitcoin, more than anything else, is often compared to the Internet back in the technology's early days. Both are rooted in fringe ideologies and, if you believe the hype, both have the ability to disrupt and empower via distributed networks of data.  The comparison is something that the State of Bitcoin has tracked since the series began. So, how is the currency fairing so far?  In investment terms, bitcoin startups are outperforming expectations – with $786m predicted to be invested in bitcoin by the end of this year (Slide 38), versus the $639 Internet companies netted in 1996.  This is taking into account BitFury's latest $20m deal, which took place in Q3, alongside inflation and other startup running costs. Last year, bitcoin exceeded investment in 1995 Internet startups by $112m.  2. Bitcoin is looking more like a currency  Over the course of the currency's short history, bitcoin has made a name for itself in the media as the speculators' drug of choice through its dramatic peaks and troughs. While great headline fodder, these wild swings have limited bitcoin's reliability as a day-to-day currency.  However, as volatility has eased off over the last few months, bitcoin's trademark spikes have been smoothing out. The report shows that Q2 saw the lowest peak-to-trough percentage (20%) in recent memory. At its highest, the price was $262.48 and its lowest, $218.27 (Slide 11). This is down from 84% the same time last year.  The knock-on effect of Q2's comparative calm, as Slide 22 shows, was reflected in the amount of interest in price stories on CoinDesk, as well as headlines from the mainstream media.  It also affected the quarter's trading volume, which is continuing to dip in absence of big daily price movements (Slide 12).  3. But it's still not a hit with consumers  So, could this reduced volatility signal a move away from bitcoin as an investment vehicle and towards a day-to-day currency?  The figures aren't exactly encouraging. Although they make up its prime demographic, 51% of Millenials in a recent survey from Goldman Sachs said they had no plans to ever use the currency (Slide 25).  And while the number of bitcoin wallets continues to rise steadily, which we also witnessed in Q1, the number of merchants accepting the currency continued to slow in Q2 (Slide 57).  Some, shown here, have quietly dropped it as a payment option following poor sales.  4. China-based miners are now the majority  Chinese miners including BTC China, AntPool and F2Pool accounted for over 50% of the network's hashing power in June (Slide 75). GHash.io, which sparked a high-profile debate around the dangers of mining centralisation – namely, a 51% attack – back in mid-2014, has seen its slice diminish significantly.  As well as having a supply of cheap power and labour, miners in China have proven their ability to build large-scale operations in a short window of time – crucial in an industry that has become a hashrate arms race.  In the five weeks after the launch of BTC China's pool, the company said it had generated over $1.2m in bitcoin. Back then, it only had 5% of the network's hashing power. Today it has significantly more.  5. The US is still bitcoin's biggest fan  Though Silicon Valley's share of bitcoin investment dipped below 50% this quarter (Slide 42) following Xapo's relocation to Switzerland, a decision the company said was prompted by privacy concerns, stars and stripes still dominate the $834m investment poured into bitcoin startups to date.  In Q2, the total funding in the US and Canada grew by 28%, with huge rounds from Circle and Ripple, with the region now accounting for 72% of all VC money to date (Slide 39).  There are now 23 countries with VC-backed startups, yet investment from the US ($569.1m) is almost triple the rest of the world put together. For example, the UK, in second place, has attracted $42.9m in bitcoin investment to date, just 7.5% of its ally. At the bottom of the table, the Philippines makes up just 0.02% of the US total (Slide 40).  In summary, if you want to raise, raise in the USA.  6. Big bucks come from thinking big  While it helps to raise in the land of the free, the Q2 report revealed another common thread in many of the best-capitalised bitcoin startups: their ambitions.  'Universal' startups (those performing multiple functions in the ecosystem) raised the most funding this quarter ($50.1m), led by Circle. They were closely followed by startups offering financial services ($45.7m).  It appears it helps to think big when raising capital (Slide 44). The category, which also includes companies such as 21 Inc and Coinbase, has surpassed wallets and mining companies to become the biggest source of VC investment – now totalling above $300m (Slide 45) – which is nearly 40% of all investment (Slide 46). The remainder are yet to exceed the $100m mark.
