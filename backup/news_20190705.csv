42382317,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9r8Wl,1562338887,XRP Was Worst Performing Top-10 Crypto in H1 – But BNB Shone,"The first half of 2019 brought goods times for cryptos in general, and particularly Binance coin. XRP, though, eked out relatively meager gains.  The third largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization closed at $0.396411 on June 30, representing 12.45 percent gains on the 2019 opening price of $0.352512 seen on Jan. 1, according to data source CoinMarketCap.  While not terrible by any normal standards, the double-digit price gain pales in comparison to binance coin’s (BNB) staggering 424-percent rise.  The seventh-largest cryptocurrency by market value, BNB is the exchange's native token used for various purposes including paying trading fees on Binance's platforms. Its price rose from $6.19 on Jan. 1 and closed at $32.44 on June 30 to become the best performing top-10 cryptocurrency H1 2019.  BNB is currently trading at $33.50, having hit a record high of $39.52 on June 22. Apart from its role in the growing trading activity on Binance, BNB likely benefited from token sale platform Binance Launchpad, which required participants to purchase the exchange coin.  Meanwhile, other top-10 cryptocurrencies – excluding stablecoin tether – also outperformed XRP by leaps and bounds in the first six months.  Litecoin rallied 301 percent in the first six months as markets likely priced in an impending miners' reward halving, due in August.  Bitcoin, the top cryptocurrency, jumped 188 percent and looks set to rise even further ahead of its own halving, scheduled for May 2020. Further, the narrative is becoming entrenched in the markets that Facebook’s fiat and government bond-backed Libra cryptocurrency is net-positive for bitcoin, an anti-establishment asset.  While the $7,000 rise in bitcoin boded well for most cryptocurrencies, it did little good for XRP. Its dull performance looks even more confounding if we take into account the bullish technical developments on XRP’s chart.  To start with, XRP’s 50-day moving average (MA) crossed above the 200-day moving average at the end of May, confirming a golden crossover – a long-term bull market indicator. The 100- and 200-day MAs also produced a bullish crossover in early June.  Buyers, however, repeatedly failed to keep prices above $0.47 as seen in the chart below.  Daily chart  The situation looked hopeful when XRP breached a contracting triangle pattern on the higher side on June 22. The breakout, however, was short-lived, and prices fell 12 percent on June 27.  The failed breakout invited more selling and the cryptocurrency fell to $0.37 earlier today, the lowest level since May 24.  Looking forward, a convincing break above the June 26 high of $0.50 is needed to confirm a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change.

42382308,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9r8Nx,1562335205,Arrington-backed Crypto Loans Firm to Accept Telegram's Token as Collateral,"Crypto loans firm Nexo says it will accept the gram ICO token from Telegram as collateral. Trouble is, the tokens may not be available for some time.  Nexo said that, once tokens have been received following the first public sale of gram tokens through the Liquid exchange platform, kicking off on July 10, it will allow customers to use the tokens as backing for its instant credit lines and planned credit card.  The limited gram sale – the first open to the general public – is being made via Gram Asia, a Korean firm claiming to be the largest holder of gram token – obtained through Telegram's private, multi-stage ICO in 2018. The token sale reaped an astonishing $1.7 billion in two phases – the highest raised via an ICO at the time. Telegram is not associated with the gram offering, Liquid has told CoinDesk.  The ICO funding is being used to develop the Telegram Open Network (TON), an ambitious blockchain project aimed to decentralize multiple facets of digital communication, ranging from file sharing to browsing to transactions.  The Liquid exchangehttps://www.liquid.com/gram/ indicates that gram tokens will go on sale at a price of $4 each. Both U.S. dollars and the USDC stablecoin may be used for purchases.  However, it may be some time before grams are actually in users' hands and can actually get to use them for backing Nexo's loans.  That's because the tokens will not be made available to investors immediately. New holders will have to wait until the TON launch, at which point tokens will be paid out in four tranches over 18 months.  Nexo told CoinDesk:  ""If the mainnet launches, users would be able to claim their tokens at launch and immediately leverage them to borrow from Nexo, or to spend via our upcoming credit card.""  TON is slated to go live in Q3 2019, the representative said.  Should grams go see a wider public offering, the token has ""the potential to become one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap,"" according to Nexo. The full launch of the TON network is also likely to boost the market for grams, it said.

Electrum’s founder Thomas Voegtlin told CoinDesk from the BIP001 blockchain event in Odessa, Ukraine, that work on the solution for sending lightning transactions with the Electrum wallet is now close to its official release.  While he declined to reveal a specific release date, Voegtlin said:  “We’ve been doing this work for about a year in a separate branch [on GitHub] and we’ve reached the point when we are ready to merge it with our master branch. This is going to happen in the coming weeks until the end of July, and it means that the next major release will have lightning support.""  At the event, Voegtlin showed CoinDesk a test version of the wallet on his mobile phone (see image below).  The lightning network is an in-development ""layer 2"" scaling technology that is aimed to enable faster payments, lower fees and greater transaction throughput than the bitcoin network can provide directly. There are several iterations in development by different projects.  Voegtlin noted, though, that Electrum chose not to integrate with the existing lightning clients, and instead developed its own implementation.  “We want to give users control over their funds,” he said.  The product will be similar to that of Eclair, the lightning wallet, which itself uses Electrum servers to interact with the bitcoin network.  Similarly, Electrum uses its servers for bitcoin transactions, but for the interaction with the lightning network it will not, Voegtlin explained.

42382321,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9r8aX,1562324426,"Bitcoin Price Drops 5% But Rebound Likely, Charts Suggest","View  BTC has fallen more than $1,000 in the last 24 hours, establishing a bearish lower high at $12,061.  A high-volume break above $12,061 is thus needed to revive the bullish view put forward by a bearish channel breakout seen in the 4-hour chart earlier this week. That would open the doors to $13,880.  A move below Wednesday’s low of $10,830 would shift risk in favor of a drop to Tuesday’s low of $9,614.  Bitcoin’s (BTC) price needs to break above $12,061 to mitigate bearish pressure.  The top cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading at $11,200 on Bitstamp, representing a 5 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  The price drop contradicts the bullish picture painted by technical charts – the hourly chart was reporting a high-volume bullish breakout in the European trading hours yesterday.  Further, some observers called a bull revival following Tuesday’s sharp recovery from $9,600. For instance, renowned cryptocurrency trader and analyst Josh Rager tweeted Wednesday that BTC is looking ""extremely bullish.""  Overall, BTC was looking primed for a rally to key resistance at $12,448 yesterday. Instead, prices topped out at $12,061 and fell back to $11,800 earlier today, charting a bearish lower-high pattern.  As a result, a high-volume break above $12,061 is needed to revive the bullish view.  4-hour chart  The falling channel breakout confirmed July 3 ended up creating a second recent bearish lower high at $12,061; the first created June 28 at $12,448.  The failure to post big gains above $12,000 could be associated with the fact that buy volumes (green bars) remained low even after the channel breakout.  A break above $12,061 would revive the bullish view put forward by the bearish channel breakout and open the doors to $13,880.  The move above the latest bearish low, however, needs to be backed by a surge in volumes.  Daily chart  The 5 percent drop seen overnight took the shine off the bullish hammer reversal seen in the previous two days.  That said, prices are still holding above $10,830 – the low of Tuesday’s bullish ""marubozu"" candle – a bullish continuation candle, which has little or no upper and lower shadows.  So, the probability of BTC invalidating the bearish lower-high pattern with a high-volume move above $12,061 is still high.

The Venezuelan Ministry of Finance tweeted the news late on Wednesday at an event marking the tenth anniversary of the Bank of Venezuela (BoV), quoting Maduro as saying (via informal translation):  ""I give the express order for transaction counters for The Petro to be opened in all Bank of Venezuela agencies.""    #EnVivo | Pdte. @NicolasMaduro: Doy la orden expresa para que se abran taquillas de transacciones de El Petro en todas las agencias del Banco de Venezuela#TrabajoPazYProduccion#10AñosBDV pic.twitter.com/mTMy8j2xs7        — MPPEF (@MinEcoFinanzas) July 3, 2019      While there are no other details available so far, the move is presumably aimed to allow BoV customers to buy and deposit petros.  The move comes as the latest effort by the president to force Venezuelan institutions to boost use of his crypto pet project.  Marduro launched the petro early last year as a means to sidestep economic sanctions and has since ordered banks to use the token – which is claimed to be pegged to the country's rich oil reserves – as well as state-owned companies.  He has further mandated that payments for passports should be made in petros – a possible means of slowing the exodus of people from the troubled nation, as petros are not readily available to the populace.  The petro has also been tied to the new national fiat currency, the sovereign bolivar, and even pegged pension and salary systems to the token.

42382299,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9r8Iv,1562317244,Bank of Japan: Adopting Central Bank Crypto Would Mean Dropping Cash,"An official at the Bank of Japan (BoJ) has ruled out the use of central bank digital currencies because to do so may require the country to abandon cash.  According to a report by Reuters, Masayoshi Amamiya, deputy governor of the Japanese central bank, on Friday cast shade on the notion that central banks could make negative interest rate policies more effective by issuing their own digital currencies (CBDCs).  The issue comes down to the fact that, if the BoJ issues a digital yen and set a negative interest rate, individuals and businesses would effectively be charged for holding the CBDC. As a result, he argued, holders would drop the digital coin and instead hold cash.  Amamiya concluded:  “To overcome the nominal zero lower bound, central banks would need to eliminate cash. Eliminating cash would make settlement infrastructure inconvenient for the public, so no central bank would do this.”  Back in April 2018, Amamiya also said the BoJ had no plans to issue a CBDC directly for consumers because it could undermine the existing two-tiered system and affect financial stability.  Currently central banks only give access to limited entities such as private banks, which face consumers directly in a second tier. Launching a digital currency backed by the central bank would change the system without proving to be financially stable, he argued.

42382310,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9r8PD,1562313621,Billion-Dollar Returns: The Upside of Facebook's Libra Cryptocurrency,"Kirk Phillips is an entrepreneur, certified public accountant (CPA) and author of ""The Ultimate Bitcoin Business Guide: For Entrepreneurs & Business Advisors."" Adam B. Levine is the creator of the long-running Let's Talk Bitcoin! podcast and founder of Tokenly Inc.              At first glance, Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency doesn’t make sense.  On its face, it is a non-speculative token which uses enough decentralization to make it difficult if not impossible for Facebook to profit off it as the company does from its social media platform.  But in crypto, there is always an upside to the people who launch a new protocol, in the event the protocol succeeds and even in many cases for simply having started development of the project.  This article deals specifically and exclusively with that upside, admittedly handwaving aside many other potential issues with the protocol, to be addressed elsewhere.  Libra users  It's important to realize that Facebook is actually launching two cryptocurrencies: the one everyone's talking about (Libra) and the one available only to Facebook and its corporate partners (the Libra investment token).  The former will be backed by a basket of fiat currencies and cash equivalents, which means that for every dollar of Libra in existence, there will be (in theory) a “dollar” worth of real-world assets which that token may be exchanged for under certain conditions.  As a normal user, you’d get $100 worth of Libra by spending $100. Your Libra can (again, in theory) be used across a variety of platforms or sent to an approved friend.  The Libra Association (a Swiss not-for-profit) puts your $100 into a variety of low-risk, short-term investments like U.S. Treasury bills. As of July 1, the one-month T-bill was yielding 2.125 percent on an annualized basis, so the association would earn $2 and change on your $100 Libra purchase.  What happens to that money?  Libra investors  Those funds are controlled and spent by the Libra Association. According to the white paper, funds are used first to fund the operation of the network with the remainder being divided among the Libra Investment Token holders according to their holdings, with policies determined by the association.  The association itself is made up of holders of the Libra investment token who invested a minimum of $10 million, as well as “special impact groups” selected by the association to have a vote but who don’t have to buy the investment token.  From the white paper:  “How will the reserve be invested? Users of Libra do not receive a return from the reserve. The reserve will be invested in low-risk assets that will yield interest over time. The revenue from this interest will first go to support the operating expenses of the association — to fund investments in the growth and development of the ecosystem, grants to nonprofit and multilateral organizations, engineering research, etc. Once that is covered, part of the remaining returns will go to pay dividends to early investors in the Libra Investment Token for their initial contributions. Because the assets in the reserve are low risk and low yield, returns for early investors will only materialize if the network is successful and the reserve grows substantially in size.” [Emphasis added]  Early investors are primarily large technology and VC companies, for whom $10 million isn’t actually a huge investment.  The big numbers come into play when you look at what success, big or small, would look like for the investors, at which point suddenly the project makes sense.  Size of the pie  To size up Libra's potential market, let's look at the U.S. money supply as tracked by the Federal Reserve.  In January 2019, M1 (which includes cash, coins, and money in checking accounts) stood at $3.7 trillion, in a country of about 329 million people. This compares against M2 at more than $14 trillion, which is everything in M1 plus savings accounts, money market funds, certificates of deposit and other bank deposits.  Assume that after a couple of years Libra has achieved adoption equal to 10 percent of M1. We’ll also assume that by this time Libra has sold $1 billion worth of the investment token and that it costs $1 billion a yearto run the network and manage the fund's investments. And we'll assume T-bill rates hold constant.  After those expenses, Libra would be generating almost $7 billion of interest per year, with a yearly return on investment (ROI) of 688.51 percent.  Remember, it's the investment token holders who are reaping this return, not the Libra currency holders, who earn no interest on their collateral. The former group, in aggregate, have put in a much smaller amount of money than the latter – which is why they get such eye-popping yields from a portfolio of low-risk instruments.  Stealth returns  Over ten years, a hypothetical investment of $500 would return dividends of $34,425.35, assuming zero adoption beyond that initial 10 percent of M1. Of course, you can't just invest $500, since the minimum threshold for investment tokens is $10 million – which, in this scenario, returns $688 million.  And that's the conservative scenario.  The craziness here becomes even more apparent looking at our “middle of the road” scenario, where we assume that Libra would see adoption equivalent to 15 percent of the more inclusive money supply figure M2.  Yearly returns spike to 4,478 percent with $44.7 billion in net gain to investors. That hypothetical $500 investment returns $223,924.45 over 10 years and the $10 million minimum investment nets $4.4 billion over 10 years – still assuming zero new adoption  Market share takeover  In our “Partial Global Adoption” scenario, we use 25 percent of U.S. M2 as the stand-in for 10 percent to 15 percent of global M2. Yearly returns surge to 7,530% with net returns of just over $75 billion. Returns for $500 would hypothetically be $376,540, while $10 million buy-in nets investors a cool $7.53 billion.  The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) takes honors in arecent report as the largest bank in the world with a whopping $3.47 trillion in assets. Banks haven’t had a market share challenger to their centuries-old oligopoly until now.  If Libra grabs a 25 percent market share of the U.S. M2 money supply, it would be the world's ""No. 1 bank."" It could achieve the same thing with a much lower percentage than that of the global money supply.  It’s taken ICBC almost 35 years to reach global dominance and Libra could hack that timeline and be the fastest all-time to reach number one.  The derivative opportunity  This is, of course, only the currency side of the opportunity. A longtime Holy Grail of cryptocurrency, not to speak of markets generally, has been the creation of a “trustless,"" tokenized, collateralized assets and derivatives marketplace.  In any Libra success scenario, we can be assured that Libra-collateralized assets will quickly follow. Doing so opens up the next phase of the speculative opportunity with the potential for exponential returns far beyond the examples above.  Derivative, collateralized markets could represent hundreds of trillions of dollars of additional capital to the Libra system.  Supra-national digital currency  Libra is in a very real way, different. To longtime bitcoin users and advocates, it is both a beautiful and terrifying thing.  Part of cryptocurrency’s promise is the introduction of unstoppable competition in money. While governments have long maintained a tightly held monopoly on the issuance and management of regional and reserve currencies, that reality is largely by nature of there being no better, pervasively accepted alternatives.  Libra could very quickly change all of that.On a recent episode of Let’s Talk Bitcoin!, co-host Andreas M. Antonopoulos observed:    “...This makes [Libra] look like a kind of Neo-IMF [International Monetary Fund]. A new model for an IMF that is based on consumer or retail banking, with reserves built up by consumers but which will give them the ability to do things very similar to what the IMF does.      ""If I’m a central banker, or if I’m a government politician or someone who works in the finance ministry of say, France or India, I would look at this and say 'Dear God; at some point [Libra] will be able to come in, not only buy up our bonds, but then hold us over a barrel' and dictate to small countries, until eventually it can dictate to medium countries, then large countries...”    Facebook is, right now, the dominant player in social media with more than 2 billion users on a planet of around 7.7 billion. This enormous scale comes with incredible power and lots of scrutiny. While its ability to hold the high ground in years and decades to come is an open question, few would doubt the depth of the company's resources today, whether financial, technological or the sheer number of eyeballs served.  Libra seems like a way to capitalize on Facebook’s dominance of today's social media (and its partners' industries) to kick-start a real, global network effect around a supra-national digital currency.  If even a fraction of Facebook’s user base converts to Libra, it’s on the path to becoming the largest and most profitable “financial institution” (albeit decentralized) in the world.
