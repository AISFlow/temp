On Wednesday, Superior Court Justice Jane Kelly ordered Matthew Phan to hand over 281.41 bitcoins to the Ministry of the Attorney General, according to a report from The Toronto Star. The funds will go to the province of Ontario.  Phan reportedly pleaded guilty last December to attempting to import a gun and possessing cocaine and other drugs for trafficking that prosecutors said were brought on dark web sites.  Kelly was quoted as saying in the report:  “It is a reasonable inference to draw that payment for such illegal narcotics sales was made using bitcoin that was found in the digital wallet on Mr. Phan’s computer.”  In a forfeiture hearing earlier this year, Phan argued that not all of his bitcoin was used for illegal activities and that some were used for trading gold, the Star reports. He also claimed to be selling the cryptocurrency on various cryptocurrency exchanges.  As a result, in Wednesday’s ruling, Kelly said that, of the 288 bitcoins, she was “not satisfied” that 7.23 bitcoins (worth around $36,000) were proceeds of crime and that they would not be forfeited.  Phan, whose computer holding the bitcoins was seized in 2015, is yet to be sentenced.

42381756,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9p1s5,1554393904,"Coinbase, Paradigm Invest $15 Million in Startup Behind Disappearing Blockchain","A blockchain that makes its blocks disappear has raised a fresh $15 million.  Coda protocol, announced last May as the first project of the startup O(1) Labs, was initially backed by a seed equity round from MetaStable, Electric Capital, Polychain and AngelList co-founder Naval Ravikant. Now, investors Accomplice, Coinbase Ventures, Paradigm and General Catalyst are pumping an additional $15 million into the startup.  With Coda, O(1) Labs has been building a blockchain that allows every user to participate in consensus.  CEO Evan Shapiro told CoinDesk in an email:  ""We see Coda as way more than just payments, what we're excited about is for Coda to enable new kinds of apps and games made possible by a cryptocurrency with a lightweight blockchain that is way easier to develop for and use.""  The O(1) team describes Coda as a succinct blockchain. From its whitepaper: ""A succinct blockchain is a blockchain with verification complexity essentially independent of chain length.""  It only takes 22 kb to store a copy of the Coda blockchain and that will always be true, Shapiro said. This is possible because Coda uses zk-SNARKs to generate proof that the most recent block and all prior blocks are accurate. Once the proof is generated, even an older smartphone can quickly and easily verify the validity of the proof and story a copy of it locally.  Meanwhile, the main nodes doing the harder worker of generating that proof no longer need to hold onto old blocks if they don’t want to. If the proof checks out, they can be tossed away.  This means that unlike bitcoin, participating in the network as a node doesn't require terabytes of storage space. Every single mobile wallet can participate at that basic level, helping to secure the network and providing confidence to users.  In an email, Ash Egan of Accomplice VC called O(1) Labs ""an ambitious team taking a unique approach to the hotly contested base layer protocol category.""  What's next  Shapiro declined to indicate a timeline for when Coda tokens will be released. ""Expect updates on this in the coming months,"" he said.  That said, Coda's testnet has been up since September and its protocol has been open sourced on GitHub.  Details are limited, but he promises that developers will be able to build Coda into their applications using only a ""script"" tag. That is, unlike the extensions ethereum users might be familiar with (such as MetaMask), it will be technically easier to build Coda into something like a video game.  With today's news, O(1) is now inviting users to participate in several ways – such as joining its app program or running nodes.  Accomplice's Egan wrote:  ""Coda's approach democratizes consensus, validation and accessibility for users around the world.""

42381761,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9p20t,1554386427,The Biggest Winners from April's Early Crypto Market Rebound,"Bitcoin and the rest of the cryptocurrency market have started Q2 off with an emphatic bang, having at one point increased the market’s total capitalization by nearly $40 billion since the beginning of April.  Indeed, bitcoin led the market-wide charge on April 2, surging over 20 percent in a single hour - a move that had since extended to a 136 day high of $5,304 yesterday, according to data from CoinDesk’s price data.  A common byproduct of a rallying bitcoin, however, is diminished returns of the BTC denominated trading pairs of most other cryptocurrencies, as opportunistic investors tend to shift funds into the market leader when it picks up a bid.  Such was proven Tuesday when almost all of the top 50 cryptocurrencies ranked by market cap were posting impressive 24-hour gains in US-dollar value, yet only Nano (NANO) was found to be reporting BTC denominated gains, Messari data revealed.  On Wednesday, though, it seemed investors were rotating funds back into the many other cryptocurrencies besides bitcoin, boosting both USD and BTC denominated values significantly.  Highlighted above were the top performing cryptocurrencies so far this month as of yesterday's trading session, according to Messari data.  As can be seen bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, once again is being outperformed by others, granted the prices of smaller cryptocurrencies are easier to move since they have smaller market caps and are more thinly traded.  Bitcoin Cash (BCH), a fork of the bitcoin blockchain, is the standout best performer so far this month, at one point flashing 94 percent price growth against the USD, roughly 50 percent of which was recorded on Wednesday alone as its BTC pair surged nearly 40 percent.  Litecoin (LTC) has also aggressively extended its impressive Q1 gains into the second quarter of the year. The cryptocurrency's trade price is now up 43 percent month-to-date, albeit the figure was above 54 percent yesterday, after rising 31 percent in USD value and coming just shy of a $100 price tag on most exchanges.  The price of the “worst” performer in this group on Wednesday was Aion (AION), which aims to act as a bridge connecting different blockchains, still reflected a strong USD denominated increase of 25 percent and a notable 16 percent jump in BTC value.  With the reasons for the recent market surge pointing to technical catalysts, the perhaps unparalleled volatility is creating a day trader’s paradise, although such volatility being back for the long haul is not quite yet a certainty.

42381751,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9p1ln,1554382854,Digital Asset Goes Open Source as Firm Eyes Closer Ties With Hyperledger,"Blockchain startup Digital Asset is open sourcing its Digital Asset Modelling Language (DAML), the beating heart of projects like the partial re-plumbing of the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX).  Announced Thursday, the move sees DA making DAML freely available – opening the door to its source code, its runtime system, and the software development kit (SDK), all under an Apache 2.0 license.  It’s a major strategy play from the New York City-based software firm which has had a shaky couple of months following the departure of chief executive Blythe Masters.  But Dan O'Prey, chief marketing officer, Digital Asset, said it was always the intention to open source the code; a question of when, not if. He told CoinDesk that the plan is now to cast the net wide, adding:  “So this isn't a useless stripped down version, this is the full DAML that anyone can modify, extend, fork or even integrate DAML with their platform – whether it be a distributed ledger or blockchain or a traditional database or even a cloud service.”  Hyperledger connection  O'Prey, a co-founder of Hyperledger and its marketing chair, said the move will help forge closer relations with other enterprise players, making specific mention of DA’s longstanding relationship with the Linux-affiliated Hyperledger consortium.  “We are very keen to work with the Hyperledger open source community. Being open source and under the Apache 2.0 license – the standard license of the Linux Foundation – will make it much easier to integrate with the frameworks that are within Hyperledger,” said O'Prey.  Brian Behlendorf, the executive director of Hyperledger, echoed this sentiment, saying he welcomes the move to make DAML open source. “We look forward to exploring how DAML can be integrated with the various Hyperledger blockchain frameworks and tools,"" he told CoinDesk.  A parallel can be drawn between DA’s move today with DAML and R3’s Corda, which began life in a closed proprietary platform only to later go open source, rapidly growing a Corda community of developers.  O’Prey acknowledged the success of Corda open source but pointed out that DAML is not directly competitive with Corda. “DAML could potentially run on Corda,” he said.  Regarding DA’s move to open up DAML, an R3 spokesman was equally convivial: “This is the right move. DLT is well-suited to open source, as we have seen with other industry-leading platforms.”  No tokens  Similarly, DA’s singular approach to smart contracts is not a competitor to ethereum-based Quorum, the enterprise platform built by JP Morgan engineers, noted O’Prey.  “Again, DAML could potentially run on Quorum. So it would be more competitive with Solidity which runs on the EVM [Ethereum Virtual Machine] and which Quorum supports,” he said.  O’Prey said the philosophy at DA is that smart contracts require their own language built from the ground up, as opposed to a derivation of Javascript in the case of Solidity.  He pointed out that DAML eschews the sort of tokenizing technology by which ethereum deals with digital assets, typically in the form of the ERC-20 standard, so that smart contracts can run programs to move these tokens around.  “DAML doesn't use the token model at all,” said O’Prey. “DAML takes contracts and parties as first class citizens, so the way you model financial assets isn't as a bearer instrument like cash that can just be moved between people, but it consists of the rights and obligations of an agreement, of what can actually happen in the future for that financial instrument.”  Healthy future  With DAML now out in the wild, so to speak, the firm is continuing to broaden its scope beyond capital markets into areas like healthcare, for instance.  Gopi Devalcheruvu, vice president of technology at Change Healthcare, said DAML had been a “powerful, intuitive and easy to use” in implementing a healthcare payments proof of concept.  “I am excited to hear that DAML will be open source, and look forward to seeing others have the ability to implement blockchain solutions using DAML and grow its adoption in the community,” said Devalcheruvu in a statement.  In addition, John Bass, CEO Hashed Health, said DAML’s focus on privacy was essential in navigating regulation. “We fully support the decision to open source DAML, as it will help us gain adoption through improved security, licensing, and support,"" he said.  In conclusion, a DA spokeswoman confirmed the work ongoing with ASX to replace its CHESS system for cash equities was: “All systems go and on schedule.”  On the subject of funding, she would not talk specifically about whether the firm is raising another series but said it is always talking to investors, adding:  “The company goes on and we are very excited about the series of major market-changing announcements we have coming.”  Colorful code image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/04/04/digital-asset-goes-open-source-as-firm-eyes-closer-ties-with-hyperledger,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c0876ff64a6997b76b54e7e9047da8a1b55cbe22-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42381764,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9p23P,1554379202,Former Simple Bank Co-Founder Unveils New Blockchain Payments Startup,"A new startup launched by the former co-founder of Simple Bank wants to provide early-stage fintech startups with traditional banking service functionality.  Sila, founded last year and until now operating in private alpha test phase, unveiled an open beta Thursday, inviting developers of fintech firms – including blockchain and crypto startups – to begin building new tools using its API.  The startup describes itself as an ""all-inclusive API platform"" for fintechs and other projects looking to modernize the financial space. Specifically, the startup connects existing payment systems, such as automated clearing house (ACH) rails, with smart contract functionality on the ethereum network for businesses that have difficulty receiving banking services on their own.  Sila co-founder and CEO Shamir Karkal, who co-founded Simple before BBVA acquired it for $117 million in 2014, told CoinDesk that the startup, which stores its own database using the public ethereum ledger, generates tokens for customers to use. Specifically, Sila's back end issues clients ERC-20 tokens representing the dollars it holds on their behalf, Karkal said.  ""If you’ve ever talked to anybody who’s built a fintech startup and launched it, they’ve all had sort of the same horror story: ‘Hey I had this product and launched it … and then I learned about banking and what a horrible process it is,'"" he said.  Because Sila acts as the middleman between startups and banking services, developers can bring a product to market more quickly, he said, adding:  ""I think the one thing that’s super important to understand is the biggest problem in this whole space is lack of access. You can’t get a bank license easily and even the state money transmitter license is problematic, so just getting access to payment systems is huge and that access is tied to regulations. [That's] one of our key strengths.""  While the company has not officially launched, it has been operational for some time, building out and testing its systems. ""We’ve been working on this for a year,"" Karkal said. ""We did a small closed alpha starting last fall and we had about eight or 10 developers working on that alpha and some of them are shipping their products.""  Now, the company is planning to target a broader group of developers with its open beta. Karkal did not have a firm timeline for this phase of the startup's operations, but told CoinDesk that he was ""penciling in roughly six months,"" with a full launch planned for Q4.  In that time, the company hopes to add in new features and incorporate feedback from developers, as well as support a wider array of payment rails.  Bank services  Karkal said he hoped to build the ""AWS of finance,"" referring to Amazon Web Services, Amazon's cloud computing web provider responsible for some 40 percent of the entire cloud market.  He explained:  ""Back in 1998, if you wanted to build a tech startup, it was complicated. You had to find servers, connect them up and do all this stuff and it would take months and sometimes millions of dollars just to get a website up. And then along came AWS and it’s all one tap.""  ""That's exactly what we want to do, but we want to do it in the world of finance,"" he said.  The API provides support five specific processes: ID verification, bank account linking, token issuance, token redemption and fund transfers.  Because Sila's API operates on top of existing payment systems, the company provides KYC and AML services.  ""We remove barriers of regulation, compliance, and development cost, so that innovators can bring their app to market in a matter of weeks,"" Karkal said.  Karkal noted that Sila is not targeting individuals with its API – it is strictly focused on fintech startups and developers.  The road so far  Developer feedback – often on a daily basis – has been critical to the API's improvement to date, according to Karkal.  ""A lot of it is just sort of, ‘this thing doesn’t work,’ or 'it worked yesterday and it doesn’t work today' or 'it doesn’t work the way I expected it to,'"" he said.  Justin Thomas, a Sila alpha customer and the founder of Friendowment, a startup that helps individuals share their savings, told CoinDesk via a spokesperson that being able to directly access a stablecoin while also using a traditional API ""is immensely powerful.""  His startup allows groups' members to share financial assets between them, with each asset being customized for the group using it.  ""These assets are modeled as smart contracts on the ethereum blockchain and are denominated in a Friendowment-specific utility token,"" he said, adding:  ""Sila’s embrace of the blockchain to deliver their KYC, AML, and ACH services enables me to seamlessly integrate the traditional banking ecosystem in to my application in a secure and compliant manner.""  In other words, Sila has found a way for his startup to efficiently use a blockchain while still delivering its services, Thomas said.  ""I’m confident that I’m only beginning to scratch the surface of what this service model can enable,"" he told CoinDesk.  Sila itself is already generating revenue from its services. The startup charges a 0.4 percent fee for transactions during its beta program, Karkal explained, which he added appears reasonable in comparison with other payment platforms.

42381768,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9p29h,1554375607,Bitcoin Faces Price Pullback Amid Extremely Overbought Conditions,"View  Bitcoin's quick drop from a 4.5-month high of $5,345 to levels below $5,000 validates the extremely overbought readings on the 14-day relative strength index.  BTC could consolidate around $5,000 with a negative bias over the next day or two. A pullback back to key support levels at $4,672 and $4,565 (200-hour MA) can't be ruled out.  The longer-term outlook will remain bullish as long as bitcoin's price holds above the former resistance-turned-support of $4,236.  Bitcoin (BTC) could be in for a minor price pullback as the RSI is showing the most overbought conditions for 16 months.  The crypto market leader cruised past the crucial resistance at $4,236 on Tuesday, confirming a longer run bearish-to-bullish trend change and hit a 5.5-month high of $5,345 yesterday, according to Bitstamp data.  With the near 30 percent rally to 4.5-month highs seen in the last 48 hours, bitcoin's 14-day relative strength index – a widely-followed momentum indicator – has jumped above 70.00, indicating overbought conditions. In fact, the RSI is currently seen at 89.11, its highest level since December 2017.  An overbought reading on the RSI is often taken to be a sign of impending bearish reversal. In reality, however, an above-70 print merely indicates that the rally is overdone and a reaction – a price pullback – could be in the offing.  These overbought indicators become valid only when the price begins to flash early signs of buyer exhaustion, which seems to be the case with BTC.  The cryptocurrency witnessed a sharp drop to $4,800 within two hours of hitting highs above $5,300 at 21:00 UTC yesterday and is now struggling to hold onto price points above $5,000.  As a result, price consolidation or a deeper pullback to $4,600 could be seen in the next couple of days.  Daily and 4-hour charts  The long upper shadow attached to Wednesday's candle (above left) indicates the bullish move is running out of steam.  Validating that argument is the big bearish engulfing candle seen in the 4-hour chart (lower left), which indicates that the period began with optimism but ended on a pessimistic note.  Both candlesticks add credence to the extreme overbought reading on the 14-day RSI (right).  Hourly chart  On the hourly chart, the RSI has rolled over from the overbought territory, having charted lower highs over the last 48 hours, contradicting the higher highs on price.  That bearish divergence also favors a price pullback to key support levels lined up at $4,672 and $4,565 (200-hour MA).  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42381763,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9p229,1554368423,Crypto Exchange Binance Is Setting Up Shop in Singapore This Month,"Cryptocurrency exchange Binance is launching a new fiat-to-crypto exchange in Singapore later this month.  The news was announced Thursday by Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao at the Deconomy event in Seoul, South Korea, in a tweet on the exchange's account that said:  ""#Binance Singapore will come online in April. It will be our next Fiat to Crypto exchange servicing $SGD [Singapore dollar].""  No further details were provided, such as which cryptocurrencies will receive trading support.  The plan to set up the new trading platform was first revealed by Zhao in September at CoinDesk’s Consensus event in Singapore. At the time, he said that Binance plans to launch fiat-to-crypto exchanges on almost every continent.  The firm said in a Medium post last October that it was setting up the operation with the help of an investment from Vertex Ventures. It added that beta testing for the platform was already in progress in September.  As pledged, Binance has been rapidly expanding its operations globally. In January, it launched a fiat-to-crypto exchange on the island of Jersey, a British self-governing dependency, allowing users to trade bitcoin and ethereum against the British pound and the euro. It also launched a fiat-to-crypto exchange in Uganda last summer.  DEX launch  In another tweet, Zhao also provided an update on the exchange’s upcoming decentralized exchange, Binance DEX, at the Seoul event, saying that the mainnet launch is expected to take place this month. The platform entered public testing on Feb. 20.  Binance DEX is built on the exchange’s native public blockchain, Binance Chain. A video demo released in December showed that Binance DEX will have a very similar interface to its existing centralized exchange, with some additional features. For example, it includes an option to generate a 24-word mnemonic seed phrase for users’ private keys, a “balances tab” to inform users of the status of their accounts and a “user icon” in the navigation bar that shows individual wallet addresses.  Staking too  Finally, Binance announced Wednesday that its official cryptocurrency wallet, Trust Wallet, will have a staking feature by the end of the second quarter.  Staking is the practice of supporting a proof-of-stake blockchain by holding its cryptocurrency in order to get rewards.  Trust Wallet has also added support for the tezos (XTZ) cryptocurrency, and is preparing to add native support for XTZ staking via tezos' on-chain governance mechanism.  Just last month, Trust Wallet added support for XRP cryptocurrency. It also brought in the option to buy cryptocurrencies with debit and credit cards in partnership with Israel-based payments processor Simplex.

42381766,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9p24f,1554364837,SEC's Crypto Token Framework Falls Short of Clear and Actionable Guidance,"The Takeaway:  The SEC's new guidance outlines how it will apply the decades-old Howey test to crypto assets.  However, there remain a number of unanswered questions, including how the broad definition of ""active participants"" might impact projects; how startups based overseas are impacted and when and how a token might no longer be a security.  While legal experts and industry participants see this as a positive first step, the consensus appears to be that there are still many issues still to be discussed.      Well, it's a start.  That was the general feeling among blockchain lawyers and regulatory experts following the long-awaited release Wednesday of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) guidance for startups looking to issue tokens.  While the additional clarity was certainly welcome, the new framework is lacking in some key areas, these industry members said. In particular, questions remain about how broadly this guidance applies and what startups can actually take away from the new framework.  The SEC published its ""plain English"" guidance nearly six months after William Hinman, the SEC Director of Corporation Finance, announced the regulator was developing it. Speaking to CoinDesk Wednesday, Hinman said the guidance should be useful for startups to determine whether their offerings qualify as securities.  ""We try to give an example of what might be a security and also what might not be. We’re also trying to say that we recognize in certain cases the instrument is offered and sold for actual use,"" he said, adding:  ""One thing we’re trying to make clear in this analysis is that not one of these factors is dispositive, you have to look at the whole mix.""  Moreover, Wednesday's guidance is not legally binding.  The question of whether a token is a security is far more than academic, however. Because if a token does meet the definition, it means the startup or blockchain project selling it must follow longstanding, expensive and onerous registration requirements – and an issuer that fails to do so is breaking federal law.  With such high stakes, the SEC's framework was not quite the clarifying document many had hoped for.  ""While it’s helpful and it’s good to see the SEC remains focused in this area, it’s not quite as useful as a law or a rule or even formal guidance would be,"" said Andrew Hinkes, an attorney with Carlton Fields and general counsel for the investment bank Athena Blockchain. ""A lot of it is a reiteration of what the law is and has been.""  However, there are many new details in Wednesday's document, he said, starting with the concept of ""active participants"" (APs). In the SEC's guidance, active participants are broadly defined, and could be any entity which manages a project, but may also refer to promoters, sponsors or other third parties which have an impact on the possible success of an enterprise.  The lack of specificity is worth noting, Hinkes said, adding:  ""This is a pretty broad and pretty flexibly defined group and by the look of this AP definition, you start to wonder, will promoters be involved? Will independent activists or shareholders be determined to be APs and then swept into this analysis?""  Katherine Wu, a former director at Messari and policy commentator, told CoinDesk via email that the definition of ""active participant"" may pose issues for startups.  ""Taken liberally, that definition could really impact and even hinder the process in which a token project/start-up can decentralize itself,"" she said.  Jake Chervinsky, an attorney with Kobre Kim, told CoinDesk via email that in his view, the SEC used the term to make clear to projects that their tokens can qualify as securities even if the original token issuer is not involved with any expectation of profit.  ""In other words, if Company A sells a token on the promise that purchasers will profit from Company B’s efforts, the token could still be a security even if Company A has nothing to do with the project after the token is issued. I do think there could be some token projects in this situation,"" he said.  The onus would be on Company A to watch for this sort of scenario, he added.  Precedents  The main precedent-setting question that remains unanswered, Hinkes said, is when do tokens no longer qualify as securities, and when would the SEC be able to make that determination.  Hailey Lennon, head of legal and regulatory affairs with bitFlyer USA, told CoinDesk that the guidance appears to be primarily summarizing ""additional considerations for the industry"" in terms of evaluating their token offerings.  ""I believe today’s SEC Framework is intended to help the industry and give companies more factors to consider,"" she said. Yet, referring to the agency's decades-old method for determining whether something is a security, Lennon added:  ""Today’s SEC Framework provides additional clarity but it does not give the industry all the answers. ... The 'Other Relevant Considerations' on page 9 and 10 illustrate that digital assets don't fit neatly into the Howey test and there are additional factors from cases that the industry needs to consider.""  Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at advocacy group Coin Center, told CoinDesk in a statement via a spokesperson that while the conclusion to the SEC's guidance is not necessarily new, the fact that the regulator is ""saying it more clearly than ever"" is still significant.  The guidance, in particular, helps startups and developers ""who have done the right thing"" know that they are in compliance, he said.  On the flip side, it will be interesting to see how the framework is used with regard to future enforcement actions, said Philip Moustakis, an attorney with Seward and Kissel and formerly with the SEC's Division of Enforcement and Cyber Unit.  Lennon echoed his comments, saying that ""these factors could be used to justify additional enforcement actions down the road.""  Other questions  The framework also leaves unanswered other questions about federal securities laws and their application to crypto tokens, Chervinsky said.  In particular, it is unclear whether token sales conducted outside the U.S. fall under the SEC's jurisdiction.  ""It isn’t clear to me that crypto companies will be able to reach confident conclusions about their compliance status through this framework alone,"" he said.  It's an issue that has been raised before. Speaking in New York in March, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce explained that startups in other nations can easily come into contact with U.S. securities laws without aiming to do so.  This raises the question of how and when the SEC should enforce actions against startups outside the U.S., she said, explaining:  ""If you’re reaching out to U.S. investors, you can come into contact with our securities laws. ... When I see those kinds of enforcement cases, I often say to my colleagues, ‘all right, do we really expect someone who’s based somewhere, in India for example, to be thinking about U.S. securities laws at all times?' and I think that’s not reasonable.""  That being said, some startups do very deliberately reach out to U.S. investors, and in those cases, the startups must be careful as they ""can easily come into contact with our laws,"" she said.  Innovation  Unanswered questions aside, some said Wednesday's guidance – and an accompanying missive to an individual company – might simply continue to stifle innovation in the space.  The same day as issuing the framework, the SEC also published its first-ever “no-action letter,” allowing TurnKey Jet LLC to initiate a token sale. Again, while the headline was a cause for celebration, the startup was subject to heavy restrictions. (TurnKey went back and forth with the SEC for nearly a year before it received the letter.)  ""I would also be remiss if I didn’t note that the release of this framework was timed along with the ... letter,"" Wu said. ""In my opinion, the no-action letter is woefully inadequate to address questions for a lot of token projects, because the issue at hand was akin to tokenizing airline miles; nothing super innovative there.""  Returning to the framework, Kristin Smith, the director of the Blockchain Association, a D.C.-based lobbying group, told CoinDesk in a statement that while the group appreciates that the SEC is looking at how to apply securities laws to the crypto space, ""this guidance presents a framework that will stifle investment in and innovation of open blockchain networks in the United States.""  Still, Chervinsky said, the framework does provide a deep, thorough analysis of how the Howey test applies to digital assets, and is clearer than any statements the SEC has previously issued. Referring to the agency's last major pronouncement on the matter nearly two years ago, he added:  ""The Framework effectively replaces the DAO Report as the SEC’s go-to explanation for whether and when digital assets qualify as regulated securities, and by including a list of crypto-specific characteristics relevant to the Howey analysis, the Framework is many times more helpful than the DAO Report ever was.""  Hinkes agreed, saying that the fact that the regulator is continuing to engage with the marketplace bodes well for the industry.  ""It’s positive for the digital asset market to see the regulators engage with the marketplace, to continue to bring better clarity to the marketplace and to me this is a positive sign for the industry even in the form of a statement that’s not a rule or guidance or a law,"" Hinkes said.

The association plans to build a framework to encourage public and private sector collaboration, dialogue with regulators and policymakers and ""legal predictability,"" as well as ensure ""integrity and transparency"" in blockchain infrastructures. It will also develop guidelines and specifications for blockchain and distributed ledger-based applications.  The group also includes other notable members, including banks such as Barclays and BBVA, consultancy firm Accenture and French beauty product giant L'Oreal.
