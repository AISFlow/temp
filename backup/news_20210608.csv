42434519,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPDvTh,1623194064,Distributed Ledgers Included in Tech Bill Passed by US Senate,"The U.S. Senate has passed the Endless Frontier Act, a bipartisan bill tackling China's technology efforts by creating a new technology directorate that includes blockchain as a main focus.      The bill, whch was sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), passed in a 68-32 vote late Tuesday. It includes distributed ledger technologies and cybersecurity as one of 10 ""key technology focus areas,"" following an amendment by Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.). A second provision will require the federal government to examine the potential national security implications of China's digital renminbi.      This includes financial surveillance, illicit finance and economic coercion risks, according to the bill.      The bill now moves to the House of Representatives, where Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) has already introduced its counterpart.      The bill's other provisions take aim at such issues as semiconductor production, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, communications and energy efficiency. The terms ""blockchain"" and ""cryptocurrency"" aren't in the bill's language.      The new Directorate for Technology and Innovation will ""strengthen the leadership of the United States in critical technologies,"" the bill said, by trying to improve tech education and get more students to study the key area technology subjects outlined in the bill.      The directorate will also work with state and federal government agencies.      “This is a national security issue, and if the U.S. does not respond we will be left behind,"" Lummis previously told CoinDesk in a statement. ""This amendment will put our research and development efforts regarding blockchain and financial innovation into high gear, something that is desperately needed.""      The bill must pass the House and be signed into law by President Joe Biden before it can take effect. As of press time, the House version of the Endless Frontier Act did not include any language about distributed ledgers.

DeFi markets for derivative instruments – meaning futures contracts, for example – may not be legal under the Commodity Exchange Act, a U.S. law that governs such products and requires them to trade only on regulated designated contract markets (DCMs), Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Commissioner Dan Berkovitz said in a speech to the Asset Management Derivatives Forum.      ""DeFi markets, platforms or websites are not registered as DCMs or SEFs [swap execution facilities]. The CEA does not contain any exception from registration for digital currencies, blockchains or smart contracts,"" he said.      DeFi has been drawing more scrutiny since taking off last summer. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global financial watchdog, published guidance in March recommending regulators impose certain restrictions on the sector, and the World Economic Forum published a white paper early Tuesday hoping to educate policymakers about this portion of the crypto sector.    Read more: World Economic Forum Hopes to Explain DeFi for Regulators With White Paper    Legality aside, Berkovitz also expressed concerns that DeFi markets trading derivatives may not share the same protections that their centralized counterparts offer.      Regulated financial institutions are legally bound to protect customer funds, and intermediaries exist to help ensure customers don't lose their money should one entity in the market fail, he said.      ""In a pure 'peer-to-peer' DeFi system, none of these benefits or protections exist,"" Berkovitz said. ""There is no intermediary to monitor markets for fraud and manipulation, prevent money laundering, safeguard deposited funds, ensure counterparty performance or make customers whole when processes fail,"" he noted, adding:    ""A system without intermediaries is a Hobbesian marketplace with each person looking out for themselves.

42434524,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPDvhh,1623190504,Kraken Now Lets Users Back Contender Projects on Polkadot's Kusama Platform,"Cryptocurrency exchange Kraken is adding support for parachain auctions ahead of the first rounds set to take place on Polkadot's pre-production environment, Kusama.      The crowdloan period, where users can contribute KSM tokens to their favorite projects, starts now, a Kraken spokesperson said Tuesday. The Kusama parachain auctions themselves start June 15.      Winning an auction for a slot allows successful developers to leverage the Kusama relay chain, where transactions are finalized, for their projects. The mechanism lets them build new crypto assets and decentralized applications while tapping into the security of the Polkadot ecosystem, according to a Kraken webpage. It also allows interoperability among different blockchains.      ""Rather than give the projects with the most funding a parachain slot, the Polkadot team came up with parachain auctions as a method to distribute the available slots in a more equitable manner,"" according to the webpage.      “Parachain auctions open up a whole new vista for cryptocurrency holders so they can back projects that will likely make substantive changes to various aspects of our lives,"" Jeremy Welch, Kraken's chief product officer, said in a press statement.    Read more: Polkadot’s Kusama Network to Start Parachain Auctions Next Week    Currently only for Kusama, parachain auctions will launch on Polkadot later this year, so users will be able to bond DOT tokens too.

The auctions ""enable free and fair community support for early stage projects to flourish, while discouraging bad actors from attempting to exploit the mechanism as a quick cash grab,"" said Brian Hoffman, Kraken's crypto platform lead. ""By offering support for Parachain Auctions through our platform, Kraken clients can directly participate ... without having to move their KSM off the exchange.""      Parachain auctions are not currently available to Kraken users in the U.S., Canada, Japan or Australia.      At time of writing, KSM is up 5% over a 24-hour period and is changing hands for around $414, according to data from CoinGecko.

42434516,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPDvPh,1623190179,Paraguay May Be Next to Court Crypto Businesses With July Bill,"Next month, Paraguayan congressman Carlos Rejala plans to present a bill to attract international mining companies and other crypto businesses.      The project allows cryptocurrency companies — whether in mining or another segment, such as exchanges — to finance their Paraguayan operations with cryptocurrencies, remit dividends abroad and capitalize their cryptocurrency profits in local banks, Rejala told CoinDesk.    Lee este artículo en español.    Rejala, a 36-year-old entrepreneur, discovered bitcoin in 2017 and began trading in 2019, a year after taking a deputy seat for the independent Hagamos party, he said.      On Monday, following the announcement that El Salvador would introduce a bill to allow bitcoin to be treated as legal tender, Rejala tweeted a photo of himself with laser eyes and a sentence about the project.      ""The announcement prompted me not to be afraid and to think that this can be real in my country,"" he said.      The project seeks to position Paraguay as the crypto hub for Latin America and a model for other countries in the region, he said, adding that if the bill is approved, he will seek to present a second one promoting the use of bitcoin as legal tender.      It’s been a longtime goal for local business leaders, who touted Paraguay’s cheap energy as far back as 2018.      ""However, first we want to give Paraguay a blockchain-friendly status,"" he said.      According to Rejala, one of the most attractive conditions for mining companies is the cost of electricity in Paraguay, which is around $0.05 per kilowatt-hour and is the lowest in the region. Almost 100% of production comes from hydroelectric sources.      ""It is renewable energy, non-polluting, which is extremely important for the mining companies,” he said.      In a dialogue with First Mover on CoinDesk TV, Juanjo Benitez Rickmann, CEO of local mining company Bitcoin.com.py, said that mining in Paraguay only requires registration and payment of taxes, which he classified as lower than in the rest of the region. At present, the country has a system known as triple 10, which consists of 10% income tax, 10% VAT, and 10% personal income tax, Rejala added.      The country offers no restrictions on foreign capital flows and the payment of dividends abroad, Rejala added. ""That also makes it an attractive country to crypto investors,"" he said.      Paraguay does not use all the energy it produces, Rejala said. At the Itati hydroelectric plant, which Paraguay shares with Brazil, the country only takes 26% of the 6,067 megawatts it is entitled to monthly, submitting the rest to the neighboring country, he added.      ""We have a lot of energy that we sell to Argentina and Brazil almost for free because we can only sell to our neighbors,"" Benitez Rickmann said.    Next steps    A draft bill, supported by different players in the crypto sector, was presented to several Paraguayan government offices, such as the anti-money laundering office, Benitez Rickmann said.      Rejala is currently seeking to attract support to achieve the required majority of 41 votes in the chamber of deputies and pass the bill to the Senate chamber, he said. If approved in both chambers, it will then have to be enacted by the country's President, who has the power to issue a veto.      During the Bitcoin 2021 conference held in Miami, Benitez Rickmann said he spoke to a number of mining pool operators from China who asked for 100 megawatts of space.

42434512,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPDvFh,1623189020,El Salvador Residents Are Split on Bitcoin Adoption Bill,"Mario Valle, 39, a Salvadoran bitcoin investor and manager of a popular local bitcoin Facebook page, is thrilled that President Nayib Bukele announced bitcoin could soon become legal tender in the Central American nation alongside its present official currency, the U.S. dollar.      “This is very good because bitcoin is decentralized and nobody has control of bitcoin and the dollar is in the hands of the governments,” Valle said in Spanish.      But not everyone shares his enthusiasm. Among sixlocals interviewed by CoinDesk, from the capital of San Salvador and beyond, the mood ran from elation for the move to suspicion of Bukele’s motives. Bukele’s government has a reputation for corruption, leading some to wonder if bitcoin will end up just enriching and strengthening a government that shows authoritarian tendencies.      On Saturday, Bukele announced that he will submit a bill to make bitcoin a legal tender to parliament this week, though he said in a tweet Monday that the bill had not been made final yet. If passed, the bill would put El Salvador on the path to becoming the first nation in the world to adopt bitcoin as an official currency.      On Monday, Secretary of Commerce Miguel Kattán said that although bitcoin would be integrated into the local economy, its use wouldn’t be mandatory and it wouldn’t replace the U.S. dollar.      Bukele’s announcement was met with great enthusiasm from the international crypto community, with bitcoin proponents such as MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor showing support and TRON founder Justin Sun tweeting that his organization would be the first to “establish an office” in El Salvador.      Bukele – a populist whose New Ideas party won the legislative elections in February in a landslide – has strong support in El Salvador, and so the bitcoin bill will likely pass without much opposition. But some Salvadorans are concerned that Bukele has other motives for the legalization of bitcoin.      “In my personal view, without a doubt, [this] has something to do with possible sanctions that the U.S. might impose on [Bukele] and many of his associates,” said Isaac, 27, a student at Universidad de El Salvador and crypto investor who asked to withhold his full identity so that he could speak freely.      Since Bukele, 39, took office in 2019, U.S. allegations of corruption against his administration have been mounting and El Salvador’s economy has suffered during the pandemic. But Bukele’s move to legalize bitcoin may distract the world from the country’s struggles.    Corruption    In 2019, Bukele won the presidential election in a landslide on an anti-corruption platform with the slogan “There’s enough money when no one steals.”      But as the country went under pandemic lockdown in 2020, a string of investigations by local journalists looked into the government’s alleged corruption in the management of public resources and with the administration's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.      Allegations of corruption have resurfaced after Bukele fired El Salvador’s attorney general and five supreme court justices last month, following clashes over the constitutionality of his lockdown orders. Shortly after the dismissals, Bukele addressed the world in a tweet: “We are cleaning our house... and that's none of your business.”      Three weeks ago, five Salvadoran officials with ties to Bukele were named in a U.S. State Department list of senior government officials from Central America credibly alleged to have committed or facilitated corruption. Meanwhile, the outgoing attorney general was promptly replaced with Rodolfo Delgado, an ally of Bukele’s who has announced that El Salvador will be exiting its anti-corruption accord with the Organization of American States (OAS). The accord is part of an initiative to mitigate corruption in the region, which the U.S. sees as “one of the root causes of undocumented immigration,” according to Reuters.      Since announcing the new bill, Bukele has been busy re-tweeting messages of support from the crypto community, including a Forbes article that said “El Salvador could become one of the most significant monetary centers in the world” if Bukele’s bill is passed.      “[Bukele] wants to distract the press from the chaos,” said Roberto Pineda, a Salvadoran chef and entrepreneur.    Chaos    On June 4, the day before Bukele announced the bitcoin bill, Ernesto Muyshondt, a former mayor of San Salvador and adviser to the OAS, was arrested on multiple charges (though the specific charges were changed by local officials multiple times), one of which came directly from the attorney general’s office, according to local reports.      The national civil police (PNC) charged Muyshondt with improper appropriations of tax withholdings, and he is already under investigation for negotiating with gangs.      “Today, I’m a political prisoner,” Muyshondt tweeted on June 4.      Meanwhile, the country is in deep economic trouble. This year’s budget, which passed congress and was ratified by Bukele in January, showed a substantial deficit amid “limited financing options” according to Fitch Ratings.      Between March 2020 and March 2021, the country lost 36.6% of its net international reserves (RIN) or U.S. dollar reserves, while neighboring countries Guatemala and Honduras boosted their reserves, according to a report by El Economista.      “It is from April 2020 that the decrease begins to be seen and shows the use of the resources of the reserves that the Salvadoran government has been making to meet the expenses of the emergency,” the report said.      Foreign currency reserves can be depleted as governments make withdrawals without enough money coming in through direct investments or remittances to replenish them.      Meanwhile, the country’s national debt as a percentage of its gross domestic product amounted to almost 71% in 2019, and the total central government debt rose 15.9% in the first quarter of 2021, compared with the same period in 2020.      “The real truth is that [Bukele] has no place where to get more money to run the country,” Pineda, the chef and entrepreneur, said.      But Valle, the bitcoin investor who claims to have 90% of his savings in the cryptocurrency, says Bukele has worked to make El Salvador better and the legalization of bitcoin will help the country’s ailing economy.      “He has been president for two years, and he has been working for the Salvadoran people since he has been in office. He has helped and is helping to improve El Salvador,” Valle said, adding that Bukele has done more than previous presidents who didn’t support tourism or create employment opportunities.    Crypto    With the economic and political chaos, there’s a strong case for the use of bitcoin. El Salvador has some of the characteristics that have made bitcoin appealing to large crypto emerging markets like Nigeria and Venezuela, such as a large unbanked population and lots of migrant workers. In Nigeria, for instance, bitcoin is used to process remittances cheaply and quickly, while providing a way for people without the means of opening bank accounts to access financial services with a cellphone.      According to the World Bank’s 2017 index on financial inclusion, only 30% of adults in El Salvador had access to a local bank account, compared with 45% in neighboring Honduras. Meanwhile, roughly one-fifth of the nation’s GDP comes from remittances from immigrants living abroad. In 2020, even with the pandemic, El Salvador received a record $5.92 billion in remittances.      For the more than one million Salvadoran immigrants in the U.S. who sent remittances back home to their families, bitcoin can be a game changer, said Carlos Miguel Rivas Carrillo, a lawyer and founding board member of a fintech association in San Salvador.      “That part is going to be a huge improvement because they're going to pay lower fees, and they're not going to use Western Union or MoneyGram,” Carrillo said.      But Carrillo is cautious about the announcement of a bill he has yet to see and about the technical feasibility of a bitcoin economy.    Caution    Although Carrillo is thrilled that legalization might prompt merchants to start accepting bitcoin as payment, he doesn’t believe that all savings and loans will be in bitcoin or that government workers will be paid in cryptocurrency.      “There's so much volatility in bitcoin so that's insane,” Carrillo said.      Carrillo is also concerned about the degree to which bitcoin will be accessible to the public.      “We have a big challenge as a country because we don't have all the requirements to make this technologically feasible for everybody,” Carrillo said.      For instance, although there are just over 6 million people in the country, there are about 9.5 million mobile connections. But only about 34% of the population has access to the internet, and only a small minority use new technology, according to Isaac.      “Many – and I mean many – are afraid to use a laptop or have problems using their smartphones. So if one of the first things to do when you enter the world of crypto is to become very savvy about it, how on earth is that going to happen here on a big scale?” Isaac said.      Isaac is also concerned about the crypto community’s enthusiasm surrounding Bukele and El Salvador. For instance, some crypto influencers and firms have been tweeting about moving to El Salvador, tagging luxurious villas and beaches, along with Bukele himself.      “My objections to this is, why do all these crypto enthusiasts have so much hype for this guy? Aren’t crypto people against Big Government, big regulations, taxation? It seems that they don't have a problem with a wannabe tyrant as long as he supports crypto,” Isaac said.      But Valle and Carrillo are hopeful that making bitcoin a legal tender will spark a new beginning for the country and economy.      “From a vision in the future of the Salvadoran economy, he knows that by accepting bitcoin, he is anticipating and preparing for a new monetary system,” Valle said of Bukele’s decision to adopt bitcoin.      Despite the reports of corruption, Carrillo believes bitcoin could be an opportunity for Bukele to change the narrative and change the future of El Salvador.      “I think this is our right moment to make a turn,” Carrillo said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/06/08/el-salvador-residents-are-split-on-bitcoin-adoption-bill,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/da8e5e920746c577d522cad8358fba36b5395bc8-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday afternoon, BlockTower CEO Matt Goetz said his company’s acquisition of Gamma Point, which has a unique strategy of market-neutral investing that seeks profit in both bull and bear markets, is intended to help BlockTower better navigate the current market volatility.      BlockTower’s acquisition of Gamma Point Capital is one of many crypto-related acquisitions in recent months, along with deals like Galaxy Digital’s acquisitions of Vision Hill and BitGo. This purchase, however, could suggest BlockTower is preparing for the realization that crypto’s latest bull market may be over.      Goetz believes that the market-neutral investment capabilities BlockTower gained in the acquisition will help the fund attract more price-sensitive institutional investors.      Gamma Point’s executives will join the BlockTower team, tweeting: “We are incredibly excited to join the BlockTower Capital family and continue our journey to build the #1 market neutral fund for crypto.”    Read more: BlockTower Capital Launches $25M Fund to Invest in DeFi Projects",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/06/08/blocktower-capital-buys-market-neutral-crypto-hedge-fund-gamma-point,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/df8db0ea6ca4af7f9fc20c76923b7052f3248eb1-1280x853.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406519,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeuyVP,1623185306,Modern Monetary Theory and a Basic Income for All,"Everything’s amazing and nobody’s happy. Beyond the natural human impulse to never be satisfied and create itches that will never be scratched, this general air of dissatisfaction has been stoked by a system of extreme wealth stratification, the result of an inherited, upside-down economic model where we give money to the top, and we expect it to trickle down.      Universal basic income (UBI), or income guaranteed to individuals by some system they are participating in (usually the government), is one solution growing in popularity, especially during the pandemic, to better spread the wealth and reduce inequity. It is certainly the most straightforward attempt we've seen yet to address the major flaws in our global economy.      However, solutions designed to redress the problems of the past, rather than the problems of the future, are almost surely doomed to failure because they are playing in the sandbox of old paradigms.    Edward DeLeon is the founder and CEO of Anatha, a decentralized technology company building the ""Blockchain for Good.""    A better solution is UBI that works with a new set of strategies, enabled by new technologies like crypto and artificial intelligence (AI), to go beyond fiat currencies and taxation while empowering governments and the people they serve simultaneously.    Zero-sum game    Traditional economics is marked almost exclusively by extractive systems. This is seen in governments' currencies and the way goods and services are distributed. For me to have this gold or oil, I also have to prevent you from having it. In that kind of ecosystem, taxation makes a lot of sense. Government is creating its own extractive property to fund itself and support the order and infrastructure that compose a functioning society.    Read more: An Internet for Humans: Proof-of-Personhood Explained    Most proposed UBI systems require an extractive property, usually taxation, which is inefficient and often unfair. Taking money from one person to give it to another is not just unjust but unsustainable as you are only shifting around existing wealth, not creating new value.    The advent of distributed autonomous organizations, rather than extractive ones, opens up the possibility to reorganize society    Future economies built on information, information services, data, engagement or attention offer another paradigm. Information and attention – unlike commodities – are non-rivalrous goods. In these systems, sharing will be much more valuable than extracting, and thus taxation will make less sense. When you tax something, you simply reduce how much people conduct the taxable activity, which reduces the amount of tax revenue you are generating.      In new economies, you can simply use inflation models for new digital currencies to fund the government directly from the money supply and eliminate taxation altogether. Doing so would not only be more efficient for the end user (you and I) but for the government as well, allowing them to paradoxically increase their own budget while no longer bothering us with the onerous task of filing our taxes every year.    Solitary, poor, nasty and brutish is no way to go through life    Human history has been marked by poor management of scarce resources, leading philosopher Thomas Hobbes to observe that life was “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short.” This is not the best elevator pitch for society. Legacy systems are the sum of this poor management married with human impulses guided by trial and error.    Read more: Opinion: Your Wallet in 2030 Will Be Full of Free Money    As we enter a new era of technological empowerment, we should try to clear at least that very low bar of nasty and brutish, while eliminating the collective, monomaniacal reliance of government and industry on the extractive.      Part of the solution may lie in the complete transition to automation, assisted by the developing wave of AI and crypto, which will remove the kind of harsh systems that promoted no-cost (slavery) or low-cost (industrial age) human labor, as well as legacy government initiatives that are extractive, such as taxation. Automation, if deployed well, promises solutions to remove the need for anyone to take a hard labor and low-wage job ever again.      As always, with more solutions come more problems. There are fears that the coming wave of automation will remove worker agency and create even more wealth stratification, with some people living above the automation line and some people living below it. Those who live above it will become emperors and the rest of us will be the hoi polloi and suffer from tremendous structural violence.    Read more: It’s 2031. This Is the World That Crypto Created    This can be solved by taking the automation line and placing it at the very bottom of civilization so that no human being lives below it. The distributive properties of cryptocurrency can help us better do this effectively.      When we can effectively do that, with post-extractive technologies like AI and crypto, there will be systems that will emerge that allow for that possibility, to make poverty, food lines and the tent cities that have defined this early decade as an inhumane relic of the past, just like slavery. If nothing else, the advent of distributed autonomous organizations, rather than extractive ones, opens the possibility for us to follow a new way, a better way.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | FIAT | REGULATION,Edward DeLeon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/06/08/modern-monetary-theory-and-a-basic-income-for-all,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b3a2dc38c3d45ebfda6b692cd93fc79887658b26-1400x915.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin volumes and volatility are still lower than ether's but Ethereum-based opportunities have analysts optimistic for the future.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $32,938 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Losing 7.6% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $31,277-$35,614 (CoinDesk 20)  Ether (ETH) trading around $2,502 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). In the red 8.2% over the previous 24 hours.  Ether’s 24-hour range: $2,328-$2,721 (CoinDesk 20)  Bitcoin’s volume the highest in over a week    Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down Tuesday by 7.6% as of press time. The price was above the 10-hour moving average and the 50-hour, a sideways signal for market technicians.      BTC fell from $35,614 at 20:15 UTC (1:15 p.m. ET) Monday to $31,277 by 18:30 UTC (11:30 a.m. ET) Tuesday, a 12% drop based on CoinDesk 20 data. Bitcoin then regained some of those losses, at $32,938 as of press time.      Continued concerns about the regulatory regime for crypto in China were among the reasons for many investors to turn bearish on bitcoin. Some traders are also worried about the possibility of tighter monetary policy from the U.S. Federal Reserve, which might put downward pressure on risky assets, including cryptocurrencies.      As the price of BTC fell over the past 24 hours the trading volume rose, reaching $2.9 billion as of press time on Tuesday, the most since May 28. For 2021 so far, daily averages have been at a much loftier level, around $4.9 billion, based on spot markets tracked by the CoinDesk 20.      “Bitcoin has found its footing since becoming oversold from an intermediate-term perspective within its long-term uptrend,” said technical analyst Katie Stockton of Fairlead Strategies. “As it stands, we would look for bitcoin to establish a lower high versus April without damaging the long-term uptrend.”      Read More: Exchanges See Biggest Bitcoin Outflow in 7 Months. Reason to Cheer?    When will ether volumes drop below bitcoin’s?    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether, was trading around $2,502 as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET), slipping 8.2% over the prior 24 hours. The asset is above the 10-hour moving average and the 50-hour, a flat signal for market technicians.      Ether dropped from $2,721 at 23:15 UTC (4:15 p.m. ET) Monday to $2,328 by 16:15 UTC (11:30 a.m. ET) Tuesday, a 14% fall based on CoinDesk 20 data. ETH has climbed a bit since, at $2,502 as of press time.      “Ether’s short-term momentum has improved with the rebound, but intermediate-term momentum has deteriorated, supporting a lower high versus the May peak near $4,380,” noted Fairlead’s Stockton.      Ether’s momentum, in the form of volume, continues to beat bitcoin’s. For 10 straight days , the number of ETH changing hands has exceeded BTC volumes. Analysts are beginning to think this may be a longer-term trend, especially considering how much higher bitcoin volumes had been for most of the year.      Constantine Kogan, a crypto investor and founder of investment community BullPerks, thinks ether’s upstart rise in 2021 as an institutional asset is just beginning.      “Long term, I think Ethereum will grow, as proof-of-stake is proving to be a more scalable consensus mechanism,” Kogan said of the blockchain.      “Price action right now has been stronger for ETH than for BTC, and it’s shown up in the BTC/ETH correlation as well as in the derivative markets,” added Nathan Cox, chief investment officer of crypto fund Two Prime.      Read More: Ether Price Indicator Turns Bearish for First Time Since October    Hedgers paying a premium    In the ether options market, strikes below the $2,560 price level are heavily favoring puts because traders are preparing for any possible scenario, including over 64,000 ETH total open interest at the ludicrously low $400 strike.      “The recent volatility has left traders a little spooked and willing to pay up for downside protection,” said Two Prime’s Cox. “But volatility levels all around have basically collapsed at this point, with BTC [volume] trading back to the low end of the range.”      Indeed, after jumping to over 170% in 30-day annualized volatility in late May, ETH’s price gyrations are declining, to 162% as of Monday, based on the most recent data from CoinDesk Research. Also, bitcoin’s price volatility has flattened as of late, to 89%.      “I expect some rangebound trading from here as new hands are hesitant to commit new capital, and long-term HODLers are deciding if this is the right price to continue accumulating,” said Cox. “Short term, I think you see ETH continue to outperform.”    Other markets    The total crypto market cap declined on Tuesday by over 7%, according to data aggregator CoinGecko. In the market for alternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins, Fairlead’s Stockton sees a mostly flat-to-bullish outlook for the week ahead.      “Most cryptocurrencies have crossed bullish thresholds versus bitcoin, excluding stellar and cardano, which have neutral relative strength outlooks, and tether, which should remain out of favor while the oversold bounce persists in the space,” noted Stockton. “The cryptocurrencies pointing up and to the right should outperform, whereas downturns in uniswap and chainlink suggest they may lag.”      Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are all down Tuesday. Notable losers as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET):    filecoin (FIL) - 16%  uniswap (UNI) - 11.8%  chainlink (LINK) - 11.8%    Equities:    The S&P 500 in the United States closed up 0.20% as stocks in the airline sector eked out some gains Tuesday.

On Tuesday, the company said it had received approval from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority to close its acquisition of U.S. broker-dealer and alternative trading system (ATS) Openfinance Securities. The deal was first announced in October.      The purchase of Openfinance means INX can offer investors a digital securities trading platform in addition to a crypto exchange.      “We’ve got security tokens and crypto trading side by side,” Douglas Borthwick, chief marketing officer and head of business development at INX, said in an interview. “Coinbase doesn’t do that.”    Read more: Publicly Traded INX Crypto Exchange to Acquire Broker-Dealer Openfinance    The digital securities market offers traditional investors a way to trade tokenized equity 24/7 in true crypto fashion, Borthwick added. The closest competitor to INX would be security trading platform tZERO, which also has a U.S.-regulated ATS and is reportedly looking for a buyer.      INX’s platform is available in 75 countries, and its native token is held by 7,200 investors. Token holders will receive 40% of distributions from the company with no voting rights, while equity holders will receive 60% of distributions with voting rights.

42406531,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeuyjB,1623182515,Bitcoin Futures Market in Capitulation Mode as Traders Turn Bearish,"The practice of buying bitcoin (BTC) as collateral to sell at a higher price in the future may be nearing an end as the crypto's price declines, marking a shift in investor sentiment to bearish from bullish.      “Futures traders have started to price bitcoin contracts that expire in three months almost equally as the current spot price,” the Norwegian cryptocurrency analysis firm Arcane Research wrote Tuesday in a report.      The declining futures premium indicates uncertainty about the future direction of bitcoin following a 35% correction in May and another 12% drop already this month.      ""This indicates a more bearish sentiment among futures traders,"" according to Arcane.      A sentiment shift is especially important in crypto futures markets, which tend to be driven by behavioral dynamics, according to Max Boonen, director and founder at B2C2, a London-based cryptocurrency market maker.      “That’s unlike conventional markets such as [foreign exchange], where spot and forward prices are closely linked through levels determined by central banks,” wrote Boonen in an email to CoinDesk.    The bitcoin carry trade unwinds    “Many investors have been playing the cash and carry trade – that is, shorting futures and long spot to profit from a tightening of the basis,” David Grider, strategist at FundStrat, told CoinDesk in an email.      The arbitrage trade has become less attractive as the bitcoin futures curve flattened over the past few months.      Contango, a term used to describe the bullish arbitrage, occurs when the bitcoin futures price is higher than the spot price. Since April, bitcoin’s contango has narrowed as bullish sentiment waned.      The one-month bitcoin futures contract has already moved into backwardation, which means the futures price is lower than the spot price. That's another bearish signal.    Bitcoin funding rate turns negative    Arcane Research also pointed to the negative funding rate on bitcoin perpetual swaps as a sign that short traders are in control.      Perpetual swaps are a type of derivative in cryptocurrency markets used to bet on future prices, similar to futures contracts in traditional commodities markets. A negative funding rate means traders who are short – betting on further price declines – are paying traders who are long, or positioned bullish, for leverage.      “Long story short: The bulls got spooked, and diamond hands turned out to be made of coal,” Nathan Cox, chief investment officer at Two Prime, a digital-asset investment manager, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.

42406524,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeuyeG,1623181266,How the Civil War Shapes the Future of Stablecoins,"In 1861, civil war broke out in the United States. Over the next four years of conflict, the politics of the U.S. were remade and so were its monetary affairs. A new monetary system was born during the war years that exists with us today and is shaping our stablecoin future.    The decentralized currency system    Before the Civil War, there was a decentralized currency system with a myriad of coins and banknotes. All banknotes were privately issued through independent banks. (There was no U.S. government paper money.) If a bank wanted to issue currency it had to deposit bonds with its state’s banking authority. Usually, a bank could issue anywhere from 90% to 100% of the value of the bonds deposited.    Franklin Noll, PhD, is a recognized authority on the history of money, including banknotes and cryptocurrency. He has extensively written and spoken upon these topics, and he is the president of Noll Historical Consulting.    However, in some states you could basically deposit worthless bonds as collateral. And some banks just ignored the rules. The result was thousands of different banknotes, all with different values. Making matters worse were wildcat banks. A wildcat bank was a fly-by-night operation that appeared in a region and spent its banknotes far and wide. Then it would just pull up stakes and disappear, leaving worthless banknotes behind.      During the Civil War, Congress and the Abraham Lincoln administration overturned the decentralized system, establishing a government monopoly on money. It did this in a number of ways, but the most relevant to the future of stablecoins were through the redefinition of money and the establishment of the National Banking System.    Birth of the money monopoly    Before the Civil War, money could be “current” or “lawful.” Current money was public or private money that was widely used. Lawful money was official money. Once the Civil War began, Congress began to equate current money with lawful money.      For example, an 1862 law stated that no one could issue any instrument “for a less sum than one dollar, intended to circulate as money … or used in lieu of lawful money.” Meanwhile, in 1864, Congress declared that no one ""shall utter or pass ... any coins … intended for the use and purpose of current money."" Soon, current money was the same as lawful money. In other words, the only money that could circulate freely and be used in payments was official U.S. money.    Read more: Franklin Noll: Hybrid Banknotes Can Bridge Cash and Crypto    Combined with this redefinition of money was the restraint of private banknotes. As we have seen, during the early nineteenth century private banks issued thousands of banknotes. To end this chaotic situation and establish a U.S. currency union, the National Banking System was created in 1863 under the direction of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). These new national banks would be able to issue their own notes called National Bank Notes.      In effect, the OCC re-established the private currency system on a government-controlled collection of national banks that met strict deposit (100% reserves against issuance) and auditing criteria and issued government approved banknotes. Congress completed the end of private banknotes by taxing them out of existence. Eventually, the banknotes of the national banks were replaced by those of the Federal Reserve.    The Civil War and stablecoins    How does the monetary legacy of the Civil War impact stablecoins today? Let us look at some recent developments.      Remember wildcat banks and the fear of a bank issuing a worthless currency, taking its profits and disappearing? The Stablecoin Classification and Regulation Act, often referred to as the Stable Act, was addressing this very fear, but for stablecoins. The bill, introduced into the U.S. House of Representatives in November 2020, called for any institution issuing a stablecoin to be a member of the Federal Reserve System and to hold 100% reserves against any coin issuance. Such federal regulation, it was hoped, would prevent any “wildcatting.” Here, instead of wildcat banks, we have wildcat stablecoin issuers.      But the Stable Act rests on a contradiction. It basically defines stablecoins as private current money and authorizes their issuance. As we have seen, current money is legally the same as lawful, official U.S. money. These authorized stablecoins thus challenge the U.S. monetary monopoly established during the Civil War, clearly violating the laws of 1862 (unless there are no fractional stablecoins) and 1864 mentioned above.      So, are stablecoins illegal? Stablecoins run into legal trouble when they seek to be in direct competition with the U.S. dollar in retail payments. A stablecoin that tries to replace the dollar as a means of payment in everyday transactions will be identified as current money and thus in violation of the 1864 law forbidding private coins (unless you argue that a stablecoin is not actually a coin or token).    Read more: Opinion: In the Wildcat Era of Stablecoins, Commercial Banks Have New Rails to Rid    Stablecoins more closely resemble a monetary instrument known as scrip. Scrip is non-dollar-denominated private money that only operates in an enclosed or geographically limited system, and that cannot be directly substituted for U.S. dollars. Hence, scrip is not a challenge to the U.S. government’s monopoly on money. The only legal private money in the U.S. today falls into this category. So as long as stablecoins operate in closed, private networks, there should not be a legal problem.      This was the path the OCC took in its interpretive letter in January 2021. Here, the OCC defined stablecoins as a payment mechanism and not current money: ""Stablecoins serve as a means of representing fiat currency on an INVN [independent node verification network]. In this way, the stablecoin provides a means for fiat currency to have access to the payment rails of an INVN."" This is a fancy way of saying that stablecoins are scrip.      But let’s look at another interpretive letter. On Sept. 21, 2020, the OCC issued a statement that allowed national banks to hold stablecoin reserves for stablecoin issuers. This rule allows national banks to facilitate stablecoin issuance when they hold the 100% backing reserves. One can now envision a nationwide network of stablecoin issuers resting on the National Banking System. Civil War-era National Bank Notes could be replaced with stablecoins.      The Civil War replaced a decentralized monetary system with a centralized one, and in the process established new monetary definitions and structures that exist to this day. This Civil War legacy is shaping the development of stablecoins and cryptocurrency in general.",NEUTRAL,없음,FIAT | REGULATION,Franklin Noll,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/06/08/how-the-civil-war-shapes-the-future-of-stablecoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/423b6bb53ea1d964544b4e1c833dda84ea432fc3-1400x1038.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406516,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeuyWO,1623171818,Miami Coin and Voting With Your Tokens,"In the shadow of El Salvador (likely) accepting bitcoin as legal tender, you may have missed that Miami is getting its own coin. Miami Coin, built on City Coins, which is built on Stacks, which is built adjacent to Bitcoin, is a new way for the city to potentially raise funds. And it appears to have Mayor Frances X. Suarez’s approval.      The idea is pretty simple: You contribute crypto to a city’s wallet that the city could then receive as a kind of charitable donation. Whatever money you donate earns a yield. It’s the type of win-win scenario that crypto could enable but may have little chance of taking off.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    Apart from a few tweets from the project’s notable backers including Balaji Srinivasan and project organizer Patrick Stanley, it has been little noticed. Announced officially on June 4 but going live soon, it seems worthwhile asking what it’s all about. Stanley says the project needs to attract at least 20 independent miners to launch.      City Coins is a way for people to support locales they vibe with. Mechanically, they send STX to a CityCoins smart contract on the Stacks blockchain, which is then split 30/70 for the city in question and the remaining CityCoin holders who stack their tokens. This is a process Stanley calls mining.    Crypto has this opportunity to transform the way people organize themselves.    The reverse of this function is “stacking,” which yields STX or BTC rewards when people lock up their CityCoins, like Miami Coin.      “Crypto has this opportunity to transform the way people organize themselves,” Stanley said. “It’s a less-agonistic way for cities to be able to essentially generate revenue that they can spend and be accountable to markets and let communities be built.”      Whatever money is donated to a city is its to keep. A press release notes if Miami “#pickupthebag” it could put this windfall to “new public spaces, improvements to infrastructure, hosting city events, recruiting startups, and more.”      Stanley, being a bitcoiner, also played out the game theoretic position where if enough people begin mining or stacking on CityCoins – incentivized not just by their love of a city but also the tokenomics of the system – cities could pay off their debts or eliminate taxes. He cited figures he asked me not to repeat where CityCoin could balloon past the spending requirements of Miami-Dade County.      Mayor Suarez, being pro-innovation, was taken by the idea. I had my doubts. Why wouldn’t I just give a normal, tax-deductible donation to a city or organization I like?      Stanley framed it in the context of voice and exit, the idea popularized by economist Albert O. Hirschman that says governed people can signal their approval or disapproval by voting or exiting the system. You can speak up for what you want, or you can build a new world.      “I like what’s happening in Miami,” Stanley said. “But I'm not going to move to Miami because my wife and family are based in Los Angeles and I can't pick them up and move there.”    Read more: Colu May Buy Back ICO Tokens in Pivot Away From Blockchain    The constraints of leaving a city are real. Building one is even harder. But money speaks.      “Stakeholders and cities are both essentially doing work to raise the profile of the city, to attract people to move there and become stakeholders,” Stanley said. All of this is a function of feedback loops and token prices, which signal which cities are doing it right.      Is a token the way to do it? Only one way to find out.

The lawsuit, which was originally filed in February, accused Coinseed of swindling its users of $1 million through an unregistered initial coin offering (ICO) in 2018. The suit also accused Coinseed of charging customers hidden fees and making false claims. James’ lawsuit also alleged Coinseed, which does not have a BitLicense or federal clearance, of operating as an unregistered commodities broker-dealer.      The closure comes as federal and state regulators target crypto firms that are allegedly operating in bad faith. Late last month, U.S. officials hit five promoters of Bitconnect with securities fraud charges.      In May, James filed a court motion to shut down Coinseed’s operations and freeze its trading activity. New York State Supreme Court Judge Andrew Borrok appointed Washington, D.C.-based attorney Michelle Gitlitz as the company’s receiver.      On Monday, James received a court order to shut down Coinseed.      “When platforms operating illegally in New York seek to trade on investors’ money, we will use every tool at our disposal to stop their unlawful actions,” James said in a statement released Monday. “This order appoints a court-appointed receiver before any other investments are squandered by Coinseed and its CEO.”    Coinseed strikes back    Coinseed CEO Delgerdalai Davaasambuu responded with a lengthy statement posted on Coinseed’s website, calling the shutdown “immensely mournful and frustrating.” Davaasambuu denied the claims made in James' lawsuit, saying the company’s only mistake was “simply living in New York.”      Davaasambuu also wrote that the company has not received any complaints from its users, despite James’ claim that the New York state attorney general's office had received more than 170 complaints since it filed the suit in February. Several complaints alleged that users’ crypto balances were converted to dogecoin without their consent, including one user who said his $48,000 position in various cryptocurrencies became $31,000 in DOGE overnight.      In a postscript at the end of his statement, Davaasambuu appeared to address these allegations, writing: “As for the Dogecoin, I’m good at trolling!”      In his statement, Davaasambuu said Coinseed doesn't have the financial resources to fight the charges and is interviewing law firms to figure out how to return users' funds.      Davaasambuu also encouraged users and supporters to “please annoy the NYAG as much as you can.” After news of the shutdown, the Coinseed landing page features a countdown for the drop of a free token called FLJ (“F***LetitaJames”), which the website says will soon be listed on various decentralized finance platforms.",NEGATIVE,DOGE,BUSINESS | DOGE | REGULATION | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/08/coinseed-shuts-down-following-lawsuit-slams-nyag-letitia-james,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3aa14421b8cfebb166d4ed6b3941b9b2f55a2c35-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a blog post published Tuesday, Wood outlined a schedule and some recommendations for the rollout over the coming weeks of the Parachain Slot Auctions, the bidding process by which projects can secure a lease to build on Kusama. Kusama, Polkadot’s pre-production environment, is also known as a “canary network.” Parachain auctions on Polkadot are still TBD.      As Ethereum has become increasingly overloaded and expensive, thanks to the explosion of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), credible alternatives such as Polkadot, Cosmos, Solana, NEAR and others are starting to elbow their way into the base layer conversation.    Read more: DeFi Conglomerate Equilibrium Raises $8.5M to Win a Place on Polkadot    Winning a parachain slot on Kusama or Polkadot once it’s fully deployed, is an expensive business. Each auction will last a week, and in the case of Polkadot, this is said to require a minimum of 1 million of the network’s native DOT tokens (approximately $20 million at today’s prices).      Polkadot and Kusama share much of the same code and features but are independent, standalone networks, the latter allowing more in the way of experimentation and faster upgrades.      Projects can crowdfund the tokens required to win a slot using Kusama’s built-in “crowdloan” mechanism, which allows people to contribute by agreeing to lock up their own KSM, Kusama’s native token, until the end of a lease period, for which these contributors can earn rewards.    Read more: Polkadot Weighs Multichain Tech Challenges Ahead of DOT ‘Parachain’ Auctions    The start of the parachain auctions was heralded by last week’s upgrade of a ""Shell"" parachain, a kind of empty, featureless vessel, to Statemine, which can handle a mix of KSM, stablecoins and NFTs, Wood explained.      The first Kusama Parachain Slot schedule is slated to take place at 8 a.m. ET on June 15, according to Wood (and subject to final approval by the Kusama council). Winners will be determined on June 22 at 7 a.m. ET.

42406527,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeuygE,1623165551,"Hamas Tapped Binance to Launder Bitcoin Donations, Blockchain Data Suggests","CORRECTION (June 9, 2021, 12:22 UTC): An earlier version of this article said Hamas used LocalBitcoins to send donations. LocalBitcoins is not affiliated with the wallet in question. CoinDesk regrets the error.      Hamas has been reaping generous bitcoin donations and sending them through Binance as violence escalated in Gaza this year, on-chain data shows.      According to three blockchain analytics firms and CoinDesk’s own analysis, Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the militant wing of Hamas, received up to $100,000 in bitcoin since the beginning of 2021 – with a spike in donations in May, when Israel and Hamas exchanged multiple rocket attacks, resulting in hundreds of casualties.      Since May, bitcoin from Hamas’ wallets has been sent to Binance through three transactions, the latest of which happened as recently as June 6. The exchange blocked the wallet, according to Binance spokesperson Jessica Jung.      ""Our team checked the addresses and can confirm that the receiving wallet was blocked,"" Jung told CoinDesk in an email.      The address appears to have been active two days ago, with CoinDesk seeing both inbound and outbound transactions occurring this month.      ""As a matter of policy, we can't comment on any communications with law enforcement. We regularly engage and collaborate with law enforcement agencies. We have a strong track record of assisting law enforcement agencies around the world,"" Jung added. The exchange did not confirm if it was working with law enforcement at this time.    Bitcoin flows to Gaza    Last week, the Wall Street Journal reported bitcoin donations to Hamas surged during the latest escalation of the armed conflict in Gaza, citing an unnamed Hamas commander. No details were provided at the time, but since then blockchain analytics firms have been able to trace the money flow.      Pamela Clegg, VP of Financial Investigations at CipherTrace, said the firm was able to identify the recent donations, which were sent both to wallets that had been identified by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) in 2020, as well as new, previously unknown bitcoin addresses.      ""Nearly 100 of these identified addresses have received payments totaling just shy of two bitcoin during the month of May, specifically since the start of the most recent conflict. After receipt, these funds were consolidated and transferred into an identified, global exchange,"" Clegg said, declining to name the exchange.      She added that “to CipherTrace's knowledge, there has not been any actions under way to block those newly received funds by government agencies.”      That global exchange was Binance, according to the Crystal Blockchain analytic system. On May 31, over 1.59 BTC (about $57,000) was cashed out of Hamas’ wallet cluster via Binance. On June 7, two smaller transactions with more than 0.12 BTC (~$4,370) in total reached Binance via several hops through intermediate wallets, according to Crystal’s data.    Freezable money    In August 2020, the DOJ issued a complaint charging al-Qassam Brigades with money laundering, operating unlicensed money transmitting businesses and “providing material support or resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization, namely Hamas.”      According to the DOJ, al-Qassam Brigades have been raising funds in bitcoin since 2019, first using an account on Coinbase, then a non-custodial wallet and finally, a sophisticated software generating unique addresses for new donations. Hamas has been advertising bitcoin donation options via Twitter and its official website.      For the past several years, Hamas has been using accounts on a number of various exchanges and services, according to Crystal’s data. However, until May the donations were not too large.      “We noticed a noteworthy increase in the number of payments to Hamas, which resulted in over $80,000 in BTC received by the Hamas group over the past month,” Kyrylo Chykhradze, product director at Crystal Blockchain, told CoinDesk. “Eventually, the funds were cashed out” through one of the well-known virtual asset service providers (VASP).      Another blockchain sleuthing firm, Elliptic, published a blog post on Thursday, June 3, saying that “over $100,000 in bitcoin donations have now been received by the Al-Qassam Brigades since January 2019.” Before May, bitcoin would only come to Hamas from time to time in a small trickle, but “on May 10, the day that the latest conflict began, donations surged,” the post reads.      “More than $73,000 has been donated since the start of the most recent spate of violence. This is more than double the total amount received during the previous two years that the fundraising campaign has been active,” Elliptic said.      Elliptic added that as the vast majority of the funds have been sent to a “large, regulated cryptocurrency exchange,” it “will be able to freeze the funds and provide law enforcement with valuable intelligence.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/06/08/hamas-tapped-binance-to-launder-bitcoin-donations-blockchain-data-suggests,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/652037fddb6983a0781be7c04ac8d9b4e6e9fc6d-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406514,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeuySS,1623163530,El Salvador Adopts Bitcoin: Hype or History in the Making?,"Twenty years ago El Salvador replaced its domestic currency, the colón, with the U.S. dollar. Now the country's president, Nayib Bukele, wants to take what seems to be an equally drastic step with his nation's money. He wants to declare bitcoin to be a legal tender along with the dollar.      But is it in fact a major step? The significance (or not) of Bukele's adoption of bitcoin as legal tender depends on the meaning he is ascribing to the term.      Few things in monetary economics are more foggy than the concept of legal tender. Using the vernacular meaning of the term, Bukele's announcement is A BIG DEAL. If something is legal tender in the popular sense, then it has been declared to be official money. Salvadoreans would be able to walk into any supermarket and see bitcoin-denominated prices, and insist on paying with bitcoin.    J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog.    But the vernacular differs from the lawyer's much narrower definition of legal tender (indeed, there are a couple of legal definitions). A lawyer would probably dismiss Bukele's move as unimportant.    Legal tender according to a lawyer    The lawyer's definition of legal tender is any item that a debtor can always depend on to discharge his or her debt. Say Jack borrows $20 from Charlie. The debt comes due. Legal tender is a government-approved list of instruments that Jack can always rely on to cancel his $20 debt.      In the U.S., banknotes and coins are legal tender. Importantly, not a single type of digital money makes it onto that list. So if Charlie asks Jack to pay him back the $20 with a Zelle or Venmo transfer, Jack can refuse. Instead, Jack can force Charlie to accept a $20 bill, or 80 quarters, or 400 nickels. Because these items are legal tender.      In Canada, Jack would not be able to force Charlie to accept 400 nickels. The government limits the amounts of coins that qualify as legal tender. Canadian nickels are only legal tender up to $5 dollars.    The lawyer's definition of legal tender has a much more restricted meaning than the layperson's definition.    Creditors and debtors can easily avoid legal tender requirements by negotiating the terms of a settlement ahead of time. If Jack and Charlie both agree at the outset that the debt will be settled in the future with a bank transfer, then Jack can't subsequently force Charlie to accept legal tender cash.      As you can see, the lawyer's definition of legal tender has a much more restricted meaning than the layperson's definition. What makes the lawyer's version even more niche is it doesn't typically apply to purchases and sales. That's why stores in Canada and the U.S. needn't accept legal tender. The relationship between a shopper and merchant isn't a debtor/creditor relationship, so merchants can ignore legal tender laws.      Shops in the U.K. needn't accept legal tender either. As the Bank of England says, ""Legal tender has a narrow technical meaning which has no use in everyday life."" Scotland doesn't even have legal tender notes.      Europe's legal tender laws are a bit more strict. According to a 2010 recommendation, stores can refuse to accept legal tender, but only if they provide a ""legitimate excuse"" such as security concerns about having too much cash in the store.      Legal tender laws are rarely invoked. Every day, millions of debtors and creditors settle billions of dollars worth of debts using non-legal tender such as bank deposits, Fedwire balances and other digital dollars. It's almost unheard of for someone to trigger legal tender law because someone wants to default to settlement in legal tender.      So according to the lawyer's definition of the term, Bukele's desire to declare bitcoin as legal tender probably is more of a publicity stunt than a substantial change to its monetary status.    Bitcoinization    But what if he actually wants to bitcoinize?      It's possible that Bukele doesn’t just have the lawyer's version of legal tender in mind. Perhaps he is using the vernacular meaning of the word and wants to give bitcoin the full monetary treatment, enshrining it much like the U.S. dollar was enshrined 20 years ago.    A quick glance through El Salvador's 2001 Monetary Integration Lawhttps://www.asamblea.gob.sv/sites/default/files/documents/decretos/171117_072919515_archivo_documento_legislativo.pdf illustrates how Bukele might go about this.    The Monetary Integration Law made a number of pronouncements on the dollar. Article 3 made the dollar legal tender along with colón banknotes and coins. (The colón is still legal tender to this day, but it has disappeared from circulation and the central bank doesn’t print it anymore.)      But this was just the first step. Article 7 made all salaries and fees payable in dollars or colons. Article 9 stipulated the entire financial sector (bank deposits, pensions, securities prices) was to be redenominated into U.S. dollars. And Article 10 specified that prices of goods and services were to be expressed in either colones or dollars.    Read more: Adam B. Levine: Bitcoin as Legal Tender? Why El Salvador’s Plan Isn’t as Crazy as You Think    If Bukele were to take all these extra steps with bitcoin, it would amount to a big upgrade in bitcoin's monetary status. It’s not apparent yet how far he is willing to go.      But even if Bukele gives bitcoin the full money treatment, it doesn't solve bitcoin's core monetary problem. Given the choice between spending their bitcoin or not, bitcoiners will generally prefer to not spend it. That’s because the main motivation for owning bitcoin remains the dream of winning big. Paying away one’s stack of sats on a trivial expense like breakfast short-circuits this dream.      As for non-bitcoiners, bitcoin’s price is just too unpredictable to justify having some bitcoin on hand for making payments.      This has perverse implications. Say that Bukele goes all-out and declares bitcoin to not only be legal tender but also requires Salvadoran stores and markets to set prices in bitcoin and accept bitcoin as payment (along with dollars). No Salvadoran will choose to take advantage of this feature: bitcoiners for fear of missing out on a price rise, and non bitcoiners out of fear of bitcoin’s volatility.      To actually become full-blown money, bitcoin can't depend on rule-makers like Bukele. The change has to come from bitcoin itself.

The ""cryptocurrency challenge ... lies at the core"" of how ransomware attacks play out, Sullivan said at a White House press briefing Monday.  Members of the Group of Seven and NATO must increase their preparedness against such attacks and share information about current threats, Sullivan said.  ""Ransomware is a national security priority, particularly as it relates to ransomware attacks on critical infrastructure in the United States,"" he said.  Sullivan's comments follow a number of cyberattacks on U.S. infrastructure, including one on Colonial Pipeline's payment systems last month that shut down a fuel pipeline that runs from Texas to New Jersey, prompting concerns of a gas shortage in a dozen states.  Attackers linked to the Russia-based DarkSide group were paid about $4.4 million in bitcoin, of which $2.3 million has been recovered by the FBI.  The G-7 summit of leaders from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S. will take place on June 11 in Cornwall, U.K., and the NATO summit will be held in Brussels on June 14.

42421771,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpZq1,1623159000,State of Crypto: Ransomware Is a Crypto Problem,"Ransomware has emerged in a big way recently, but information security specialists have been warning about this issue for years. Cryptocurrency isn’t the sole factor in ransomware’s increasing popularity, but it is becoming a major player in this type of malware’s spread. This is an issue the industry is going to have to reckon with sooner rather than later.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Mass adoption; wait, no not like that  The narrative  Ransomware attacks have been on the rise for a while, but some recent, very high-profile incidents are bringing this type of cyberattack to the forefront of mainstream awareness. Bitcoin is one of the key technologies that’s helping aid the current rise. So naturally, a number of individuals have called for banning the cryptocurrency (or all cryptocurrencies) to mitigate these attacks.  Banning crypto won’t work. But there are steps that the industry can take to try and limit the spread of ransomware attacks.  Why it matters  On Monday, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said that any federal or international response to ransomware would include a look at “how to deal with the cryptocurrency challenge which lies at the core of how these ransom transactions are played out.” This form of cyberattack is drawing an increasing amount of scrutiny from governments worldwide. Crypto’s role in enabling ransomware cannot be denied, and if the industry doesn’t take a role in finding a way to mitigate this issue, a solution will likely be forced on it by regulators.  It’s in the crypto industry’s best interests to be proactive here. Blockchain transactions are easily traceable, meaning the tools are already there to help mitigate this type of attack. Exchanges are also starting to comply with regulatory regimes more focused on identifying users and limiting money laundering, which can also help deal with this issue.  Breaking it down  Crypto has a ransomware problem.  In the last two months we’ve seen a number of major ransomware attacks cripple key infrastructure, such as fuel transportation, national health services and meat logistics. It’s not a new issue – ransomware has been a dark cloud on the horizon for a while. But recently attacks have become more daring, and more profitable.  Let’s step back a minute and define our terms. Ransomware attacks are when a piece of software essentially hijacks a computer or network, preventing anyone from using it until a decryption key is provided. Attackers can install their malware by taking advantage of a vulnerability or tricking victim users into downloading a malicious program through a phishing email.  If you’ve heard of JBS or Colonial Pipeline recently, it’s likely because they were hit by ransomware attacks. Other prominent victims in recent years include insurance firm CNA Financial, the city of Atlanta, parts of the Irish health service, parts of the UK health service, Australian hospitals, Cox Media Group and on and on. Anyone can get hit, and it often takes tons of resources – time and money – to recover.  Attackers will provide a decryption key if victims pay them for one (hence the “ransom” part of ransomware). And while these attacks predate crypto, bitcoin is a major enabler of this form of cyberattack.  Chainalysis, a crypto analytics firm, found a massive spike in the amount of funds ransomware attackers received last year – close to half a billion dollars. Trends in 2021 so far seem to be lagging somewhat, with victims sending only $127 million in the past six months, but Chainalysis Senior Director of Communications Madeleine Kennedy noted this is only a floor. More companies may have paid crypto ransoms than have reported doing so.  While companies are loath to share details about paying ransomware perpetrators, we know a few firms have paid millions or tens of millions of dollars. CNA Financial, a major insurance firm, reportedly paid some $40 million (a spokesperson refused to confirm whether it paid in crypto). Colonial Pipeline apparently paid $4 million in bitcoin.  This was always going to be a problem that the world’s governments would have to address if industry didn’t, and we’ve now reached that point. The U.S. President has directed his staff to evaluate how the federal government reacts to ransomware attacks, including by boosting crypto analysis efforts. The Department of Justice wants to treat ransomware attack investigations similar to terrorism investigations. Leading lawmakers are evaluating these attacks.  And again, it’s not just a U.S. problem. Government agencies worldwide, including Europol and the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre joined the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and a host of private companies in supporting an international Ransomware Task Force, which published a report outlining possible methods of mitigating these attacks earlier this year.  Banning bitcoin?  Crypto’s role in supporting ransomware can’t be underestimated. A stateless, decentralized tool for value transfer can help protestors fighting financial surveillance and censorship in dictatorships or store value amid runaway inflation, but it is equally helpful for criminals and malicious actors. I reached out to members of the task force to ask whether bitcoin was a major factor in the growth of ransomware.  “Without a doubt,” said Philip Reiner, CEO of the Institute for Security and Technology and a co-chair of the Ransomware Task Force.  “Without question,” said Michael Daniel, another task force co-chair and the CEO of the Cyber Threat Alliance.  Pamela Clegg, vice president of financial investigations at blockchain analysis firm CipherTrace, called crypto “a path of least resistance,” but said other payment methods could be used in lieu of crypto.  The fact that anyone around the world can set up a bitcoin wallet and transact through exchanges or even directly with another individual means criminals don’t have to worry about hiding from a bank’s know-your-customer (KYC) processes. It may also be easier for a victim company to send a few million dollars in bitcoin than try to send a wire transfer or international payment using fiat currencies.  So let’s establish here that this is the crypto industry’s problem.  As mentioned above, one proposed solution is to ban bitcoin entirely. But members of the Ransomware Task Force, which included representatives from crypto companies as well as firms and organizations with no crypto affiliation, don’t see this as an effective solution.  “You can try it, but I don't think it would work,” Daniel said.  “It’s really not a feasible, viable approach to say that,” he said. “Instead, what seems to me is we have to find the right balance, policy balance between allowing the innovation that cryptocurrencies bring, the benefits they can provide and [bring] the protections we’ve built into the financial system to deal with criminal activity, to deal with money laundering.”  Reiner agreed. Easier solutions may include ensuring over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks enforce KYC rules, and keeping KYC and anti-money laundering rules (AML) on bitcoin teller machine kiosks.  It’s also important that companies and regulators understand how a bitcoin ransom works on a technical level. This includes understanding how exchanges transfer funds and how mixers operate.  “In any industry there is a moment of realization when major industry actors know they need to get together and take action before regulatory authorities step in,” he said. “I think this might be one of those types of situations where everyone in this ecosystem sees federal governments moving to do something about the cryptocurrency ecosystem and it’s to their advantage to be part of that conversation and maybe even lead it.”  Companies could start just by adopting the cyber hygiene recommendations recently published by Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technology Anne Neuberger, he said.  Payment concerns  Even if banning bitcoin isn’t necessarily a viable solution, bitcoin’s role in ransomware needs to be examined.  “We're in that window where a new technology has basically presented itself, [but] people are still understanding how it is going to be used,” said Chainalysis Director of Market Development Don Spies. “And I don't think anyone really understands where it's going to go and the opportunities that it truly has for, you know, the global financial system.”  Kennedy noted that while cybercriminals using bitcoin obviously isn’t good, the fact they are using a traceable cryptocurrency may be beneficial in the long-term, as law enforcement officials can track transactions and identify malicious actors.  All cryptocurrency transactions are recorded on the distributed blockchain ledger, allowing analytics firms or other individuals to trace them.  Indeed, the Department of Justice and FBI announced Monday that they had recovered some of the bitcoin Colonial paid. An affidavit filed by an unnamed special agent explained how this individual quite literally tracked this bitcoin across several transactions before finding a wallet that the FBI could seize control of.  Netwalker is one example. Federal officials indicted an individual earlier this year on allegations that he conducted over 90 different ransomware attacks, receiving up to $14 million in bitcoin (at the time).  A broader question is whether paying ransomware perpetrators is even advisable. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said Sunday that paying ransoms may encourage further attacks. She’s not alone in voicing this concern.  Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.), who chairs the House Oversight Committee, wrote open letters to Colonial and CNA last week, asking them for more information about their decisions to pay the ransoms after their attacks.  “I am extremely concerned that the decision to pay international criminal actors sets a dangerous precedent that will put an even bigger target on the back of critical infrastructure going forward,” she said in a statement accompanying the letters.  It’s not an easy question to answer though, Reiner said.  “You’re funding criminals, and in no circumstances is that a laudatory thing,” he said. “These companies are in a horrible position – either pay these criminals or go bankrupt.”  Simply banning ransom payments outright would put much of the burden on the victim companies without giving them additional tools or resources to weather such an attack.  Daniel said it was worth looking at what different nations were doing in response to ransomware attacks. In particular, some emerging markets don’t have a strong, legacy financial system, and how they approach the issue of ransomware operators within their borders could inform the broader global response.  “You want to be building these groups of like-minded countries that will agree to improving certain financial rules and agree to conduct joint investigations and agree to share information so we have a better understanding of the criminal networks,” he said. “All of this goes together. One of the reasons this problem is so challenging is it requires international coordination.”  Mitigating attacks  Better information sharing, maintaining cyber hygiene, boosting investigative resources and updating cybersecurity regulations to address different aspects of the ransomware ecosystem are all tangible steps that both regulators and companies can take to help mitigate this threat, Spies said.  “Information is not currently shared in a consistent or reliable manner,” he said. “There’s also currently under-reporting of ransomware, which obfuscates the true scope of the issue, and it means that law enforcement does not have all the necessary information to prioritize and investigate ransomware events.”  Other recommendations by the task force included ensuring international cooperation on KYC/AML regulations and establishing best principles for cryptocurrency exchanges to ensure they can provide services to legitimate businesses but not to illicit operations.  The task force had 48 recommendations overall, Reiner said.  “How can we convene conversations between smart people on both sides and figure out where it is actually falling down,” he said.  Congress has been looking at ransomware over the past few years but JBS and Colonial have “raised the stakes,” said Blockchain Association Director of Government Affairs Ron Hammond.  “We believe Congress should doubledown on solving the geopolitical and cybersecurity challenges, rather than calling out cryptocurrencies as the primary driver of this problem. Preventing ransomware attacks is a largely bipartisan issue and we hope that the solutions to the problem are defined by consensus as well,” he said.  At least one government entity is focused on technological and policy solutions beyond just crypto.  The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a U.S. Treasury Department office tasked with watching for financial transactions used for illicit activities, has been tracking ransomware attacks and assessing penalties against crypto exchanges that facilitate ransomware-related crypto transactions, a FinCEN official told CoinDesk.  “This past October, FinCEN issued an advisory to alert financial institutions to predominant trends, typologies and potential indicators of ransomware and associated money-laundering activities. The information contained in the advisory was derived from FinCEN’s analysis of cyber and ransomware related Bank Secrecy Act data, open source reporting, and FinCEN's law enforcement partners,” the official said.  FinCEN and its sister agency, the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC), have published a number of advisories. OFAC has also added cryptocurrency addresses to its sanctions list on ransomware charges. In 2018 OFAC alleged that ransomware proceeds were processed by Iranian residents, and essentially barred these individuals from the U.S.-based financial system.  In a statement, Acting FinCEN Director Michael Mosier said ransomware is “not a new issue” for the federal government or to the industry.  “Ultimately, however, ransomware is a cybersecurity issue, and the best protection is prevention, best practices, improved defenses and resilience,” he said. “While financial regulation can help with detection and slow the spread or speed the pursuit, we need to make it harder to happen, not just harder to pay. Not every actor is merely financially motivated, and we need to protect critical infrastructure and/or personal information in every way.”  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  Look, Dr. Jill Biden’s birthday was last week, ransomware’s setting the world on fire*, we can forgive U.S. President Joe Biden for not nominating anyone to a full term leading the OCC or CFTC.  *The world isn’t actually on fire.

42406530,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeuyiC,1623157734,Crypto Exchanges See Biggest Bitcoin Outflow in 7 Months. A Reason to Cheer?,"With the price of bitcoin off almost 50% from its all-time high, bullish traders are hanging their hopes on a fresh data point that might show the market is nearing a bottom: a big surge in outflows of the cryptocurrency from exchanges.      While it's too early to tell if the outflows will be sustained, the data might indicate that some traders are satisfied with the current price and have no intention of liquidating their bitcoin (BTC) on the exchanges. In the logic of cryptocurrency markets, the traders might be moving their coins to wallets, custody or cold storage while awaiting the price of bitcoin to rebound.      Crypto exchanges registered a net outflow of 22,550 BTC on Monday, the biggest single-day net drain since Nov. 2, 2020, according to data provider Glassnode. The blockchain analytics firm tracks flow from 13 bit cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance, Coinbase and Kraken.      ""The outflow can best be described as multifaceted, bordering on HODLing, and the use of the digital currency in decentralized finance,"" Petr Kozyakov, co-founder and CEO at the global payment network Mercuryo, told CoinDesk. To ""HODL"" is crypto-market slang for buy and hold.      The number of bitcoins held in exchange wallets fell to a three-week low of 2.54 million from 2.56 million.      Investors typically move coins from exchanges to wallets, taking out liquid supply from the market when they intend to buy and hold in anticipation of price rallies.      ""Investors appear to be storing their assets in hardware wallets with anticipation that the current drop in price will balance out for new price runs toward and above its previous all-time high,"" Kozyakov added.      Some investors take direct custody of bitcoin and tokenize the coins on the Ethereum blockchain to earn extra yield. Tokenization refers to locking up bitcoin on Ethereum and issuing an equivalent number of tokens tied to bitcoin's price. The tokens can then be deposited in decentralized finance (DeFi) lending and borrowing protocols.      ""With bitcoin in DeFi, investors get to maximize their earnings amidst dwindling prices, a better option for many who prefer not to keep their assets idle,"" Kozyakov said.      Data from the website DeFi Pulse shows total bitcoin locked in smart contracts has grown from 94,000 in April to about 174,000 now.      Such tokenization of bitcoin on other networks is also a source for the reduction of supply in the market.      All things considered, the latest outflow of bitcoin from centralized exchange paints a bullish picture. However, Jason Deane, an analyst at Quantum Economics, called for a cautious approach.      ""The market is currently lacking direction, sentiment is mixed, and many metrics are reporting lower demand, so this traditionally bullish signal should be interpreted with caution and in the context of other indicators,"" Deane said.      Bitcoin is currently trading near $33,000, representing a 1% drop on the day. The price fell by 35% in May on environmental concerns and China's regulatory crackdown.      While exchange outflows have picked up, demand from ""whale"" entities – those with sizable holdings whose actions can theoretically move the market – remains muted at best. While the supply held by entities holding 1,000 to 10,000 coins has increased by 35,000 BTC to 4.183 million this month, the tally remains below the May 24 high of 4.186 million.      A sustained increase in supply held by whale entities may be needed to restore the battered market confidence. The balance held by these large investors rose in tandem with the price throughout the bull run from October 2020 to April 2021.

42406528,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeuyaK,1623155497,Tor Project Receives $670K From Zcash Open Major Grants for Coding Language Upgrade,"A project is in the works to make the Tor Client more adaptable and easier for third parties to use, with some help from Zcash Open Major Grants (ZOMG). With a better code foundation for developers to build on, solutions to existing issues on Tor will be easier for developers to address.      ZOMG announced on Tuesday that it is awarding the privacy-focused Tor Project a $670,000 grant to continue to develop Arti, a Rust coding language implementation of the Tor Client. A client is a hardware or software product that accesses a service made available by a server. Arti should make it simpler for third parties to embed and customize the Tor Client than the current implementation in the C coding language. Rust is a coding language that developers use to create software.      “Arti is a project to make an improved version of Tor that will be more reliable, more secure, and easier for other software to use,” said Nick Mathewson, chief network architect and co-founder of the Tor Project. “We hope that within the next several years, Arti will become the preferred implementation of the Tor protocols.”      In a release announcing the award, ZOMG said that Arti (an acronym for “A Rust Tor Implementation) is a “next generation codebase that will focus on flexibility in embedding, straightforward maintenance, flexible deployment and performance.”      The privacy coin Zcash and the Tor Project both focus on privacy, though in different arenas. Zcash focuses on making financial transactions private, while the Tor Project created the Tor (The Onion Router) browser, which users can download to help protect them against network-level surveillance. The software Tor uses prevents third parties from tracking what websites Tor users visit.      “Thus, [Tor] fits as a “missing piece” of the Zcash privacy story – not only as a communications privacy layer for Zcash, but also for all the other communications tools that Zcash users employ,” Mathewson wrote on a Zcash community forum post.    The birth of Arti    Mathewson said he started Arti as a side project so that he could learn Rust. After a while, he realized that Arti could solve many of Tor’s long-term software issues, and so he decided to try to bring it into production.      “Onion routing has just had its 25th anniversary in May, and although Tor is a great set of privacy tools, the C program ""tor"" itself (note the lowercase t) is beginning to show its age,” Mathewson said. “We've found over the recent years that the complexity of the existing C code, and the fragility of the C language, make it unnecessarily difficult to improve the code while maintaining our security and privacy guarantees.”      Onion routing refers to a technique that allows anonymous communication over a computer network through layers of encryption.      The “C tor” is also tricky to embed in other software, as it began its life as a network proxy,      A proxy server translates traffic between networks or protocols. Think of it as a web filter, separating end users from their destinations.    Read more: Tor Developers Pursuing ‘Anonymous Tokens’ to Stop Hacks and DoS Attacks    Mathewson said Rust provides the benefits of a systems programming language (high performance, access to low-level resources, fine-grained control) with the ease-of-use of a modern high-level language.      “Roughly half of Tor's security issues since 2016 would have been impossible in Rust, and many of the other issues would have been much less likely, based on our informal audit,” he said.    Zcash and Tor    Mathewson, in his initial community forum post, said Arti could help Zcash in the short term and over the long term. In the past, when Zcash had looked into using Tor as a privacy layer, a number of issues arose.      The primary issue is that Tor is difficult to embed. Another is that it doesn’t allow for ""fine-grained"" control over Tor’s behavior or make it easy to replace pieces of the Tor implementation. And finally, the timeline for delivering improvements to Tor is long and slow because of its legacy code.      “Zcash users will get the benefit of a widely used private communication network and its anti-censorship features; their Zcash traffic will blend in with traffic from millions of other users around the world,” Mathewson said.    Read more: Brave Browser Was Exposing Addresses in Tor Mode for Months    The idea here is that while Zcash client Zcashd can support connections over Tor, the user has several extra steps they have to go through to do so. Tor’s network-level surveillance, which focuses on protecting against metadata surveillance and censorship, means that Zcash users who live in countries that censor the internet could in fact use Zcash.      “When you send a Zcash transaction today, you reveal your IP (internet protocol) address to a light wallet server or other nodes on the peer-to-peer network; this applies to virtually all other blockchains,” said Michelle Lai, a member of the ZOMG committee. “This may reduce the utility of Zcash for people who want or need more privacy than the average user. Tor offers protection against this kind of metadata leakage, but it is difficult to embed Tor into Zcash client nodes. Arti will make this much more achievable.”    The funding    The funding will go toward developer salaries as they develop Arti. Mathewson said the goal with this round of funding is to advance Arti to the point where it is ready for general use, testing and embedding.      “After that point, Arti will still have a way to go before it is a feature-complete Tor client, and we are in the process of raising additional funding to cover that work,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | TECHNOLOGY | ZEC,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/06/08/tor-project-receives-670k-from-zcash-open-major-grants-for-coding-language-upgrade,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/580bda7b979b6ac3ad7613b79de27168d8bbfafe-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value is still up about 11% year to date, although the uptrend has significantly weakened over the past few months.      Resistance is strong around the $40,000 price level, which could keep sellers active towards lower support at $30,000. The next level of support is at $27,000 which could stabilize the current sell-off.      BTC was trading around $32,800 at the time of publication.    Bitcoin registered a series of lower price highs since April and is now oversold based on the daily relative strength index (RSI).  However, in a corrective phase, oversold conditions can remain in place for a while before a price recovery materializes.  Bitcoin will need to remain above $30,000 to avoid entering bear market territory, which is defined by extended period of drawdowns (percentage decline from peak to trough) greater than 30%.  The downward sloping 100-day moving average indicates trend weakness over the near-term.

42406502,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeuvfI,1623146400,World Economic Forum Hopes to Explain DeFi for Regulators With White Paper,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) is promising but poses novel risks to the financial sector and its own users, a new World Economic Forum white paper said.      The white paper, published early Tuesday, is meant to act as a toolkit to inform policymakers about the different aspects of the relatively young sub sector within the broader crypto ecosystem.      The WEF does not intend to recommend specific policy actions for regulators, however. The document said it is more focused on describing what issues DeFi may address, as well as draw attention to certain areas on which regulators may need to catch up.      “DeFi will raise further questions about whether regulators have the proper tools to address evolving market activity, and how they can assert jurisdiction over a set of technologies and stakeholders that is intrinsically borderless and global,” the document said.      The WEF is the latest intergovernmental entity to address DeFi, after the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) – an international money laundering watchdog – published proposed regulatory guidance around DeFi earlier this year. Regulators are increasingly paying attention to the space, particularly amid the recent crypto bull market.      Jehudi Castro Sierra, a digital transformation adviser to the presidency of Colombia, said in a statement his country will be the first to use the toolkit to develop policies and regulations around DeFi in Latin America.      Possible policy approaches could include regulatory sandboxes or echoing rules established after the initial coin offering (ICO) boom of 2017, the document said.      “What is clear is that DeFi represents a distinct and potentially significant development, both within the landscape of blockchain and of financial services more generally,” it said.      In a statement, WEF executive committee member Sheila Warren said this is “a critical time for DeFi,” noting the recent growth in the sector.      “This toolkit is a critical first step in helping policy-makers and regulators navigate this quickly evolving space. By outlining the potential risks, while highlighting the opportunities for innovation, we hope it will be a valuable resource in informing balanced approaches to policies and regulations,” said the deputy head of the WEF’s Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution Network and co-host of CoinDesk’s ""Money Reimagined"" podcast.      The white paper detailed five categories of risk for DeFi: financial, technical, operational, legal and emergent.      They include the potential for DeFi hacks, market issues and flash crashes, among other concerns.      Acting Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) Director Michael Mosier said DeFi provides “a generational expansion of financial opportunity,” but that regulators and policymakers must “level-set.”      “This report helpfully provides us with a thoughtful, clear and comprehensive cartography of DeFi so that we can make the most of truly innovative opportunities for financial expansion and novel risk mitigation,” he said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/08/world-economic-forum-hopes-to-explain-defi-for-regulators-with-white-paper,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8a5867945ece445c416cd50394bf41c860c6d709-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406508,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeuvkD,1623143184,Ether Price Indicator Turns Bearish for First Time Since October,"The path of least resistance for ether appears to be to the downside as a widely tracked indicator rolls over in favor of the bears.      ""The weekly MACD indicator has flashed a sell signal for the first time since going positive in October 2020, which suggests the correction may resume beyond the near-term,"" Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, said in a weekly research note published Monday.      Moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is a technical indicator used to gauge trend changes and strength. Chart analysts consider a move below zero to signify a bearish shift in momentum and a move into positive territory as a bullish reversal signal.      Not only has the MACD dropped below zero, it is also now at the most negative since September 2018, implying the strongest bearish bias in nearly three years.      The weekly MACD for bitcoin turned bearish in the second half of April, signaling scope for a sell-off. Back then, the biggest cryptocurrency by market value was trading above $50,000. Prices fell by 35% in May, hitting lows near $30,000.      Ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, was trading near $2,500 at press time, representing a 3% drop on the day and a 9% decline on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      The latest drop follows repeated bull failures at the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) hurdle in the past two weeks. The 50-day SMA currently resides just above $2,900.      Also read: Bitcoin Suffers Steepest Drop in 10 Days as US Monetary Policy Causes 'Short-Term Jitters'      ""Intermediate-term momentum has deteriorated, supporting a lower high versus the May peak near $4,380,"" Stockton said, adding that immediate support is located at $2,038, under which the focus would shift to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement near $1,730.      ""We would not rule out a retest of the 61.8% retracement level,"" Stockton wrote.

At 20:00 UTC on Monday, the price of the world's foremost crypto began declining from around $35,466 to a low of $33,221. Prices were up slightly on the hour, and one bitcoin was changing hands for roughly $33,793 at the time of publication.      The move marked the largest single daily loss for the bulls after dropping 6.2%, the most since May 28, amid sell pressure egged on by fading bullish investor sentiment.      Some are pointing toward the ongoing pressure from mainland China on crypto mining operations and trading, where Weibo accounts from key opinion leaders in crypto have been blocked.      ""China continues to pressure crypto with rolling mining bans wiping out its most popular social media platform, Weibo, clean of crypto influencer accounts,"" said Jehan Chu, managing partner at Hong Kong-based crypto investment firm Kenetic Capital. ""This signals a tightening noose around crypto on the mainland.""      Markets worldwide have also been trading on shaky ground as investors eye the possibility the U.S. Federal Reserve could begin to unwind from its liquidity-boosting quantitative easing program. Though some, including $7.5 billion hedge fund Skybridge Capital, whose bitcoin holdings exceed $310 million, say tapering of U.S. monetary policy is unlikely to affect crypto and gold, arguing those asset classes possess resilience.      Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank, Germany’s largest lender, has said the U.S. could be in for one of its worst inflationary periods in history, with government spending and loose monetary policy likely catalysts for creating conditions last seen in the 1940s and 1970s.      See also: Deutsche Bank Issues Stark US Inflation Warning, Seeing Economic Parallels to 1940s, 1970s      ""While long-term fundamentals remain intact, U.S. monetary and macroeconomic policy are causing short-term jitters,"" Chu said.
