42405048,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKeqy,1599770197,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Hits $10.4K; Ether Balances on Exchanges Fall to 7-Month Low,"Bitcoin was trending upward before losing momentum; ether holders are moving their cryptocurrency off exchanges.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $10,284 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 0.12% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $10,174-$10,488  BTC below its 10-day but above 50-day moving averages, a sideway signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin continued its upward momentum from Wednesday, with the world’s oldest cryptocurrency rising as high as $10,488 on spot exchanges such as Coinbase before losing some steam and now moving in a sideways pattern.      Constantin Kogan, partner at crypto fund of funds BitBull Capital, points to bitcoin’s relative strength index, or RSI, as an indicator of where the market might be headed. RSI measures price changes to indicate market conditions, such as “overbought” when there has been too much buying or “oversold” when there is too much selling.      Read More: Structural Issues May Be Causing BitMEX’s Low Bitcoin ‘Cash and Carry’      “The relative strength index has shifted in favor of growth after the price climbed to $10,355,” said Kogan. “There is a chance to return to the pivotal area of $10,756, but not everything is as rosy as we would like to see.”      Kogan said bitcoin price action will depend on the global economy’s performance for the balance of 2020.      “Many analysts predict that BTC will continue to rise in price in the long term,” Kogan added. “However, this year a breakthrough is unlikely. It is expected next year if we won't see a global recession escalation.”      Read More: Pandemic Will Speed Bitcoin Adoption, Says DBS Bank Economist      In bitcoin futures, open interest has been hanging around the $3.7 billion mark for the past week.      “This represents a lot of indecision in the BTC market,” said Daniel Koehler, liquidity manager for cryptocurrency exchange OKCoin, regarding the stasis in bitcoin futures. “I think many larger players hedged at these high price levels and are waiting for momentum to clearly go in one direction.”      Read More: YouTube Ignored Warnings About XRP ‘Giveaway’ Scams, Ripple Says      Henrik Kugelberg, a Swedish over-the-counter crypto trader, points to the longer-term outlook of bitcoin versus fiat’s performance. “The macro perspective is of course that all currencies will lose value and the only hedge in the currency market the coming months is bitcoin.”      Indeed, the U.S. Dollar Index, a measure of the American currency against a basket of other fiat, is still in the doldrums, down 0.30% Thursday.

42405044,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKem3,1599769578,Privacy Startup Nym Will Pay You in Bitcoin to Run Its Mixnet,"Nym now allows bitcoin transactions and has an incentive program for people running its nodes. It is also enabling plugins that will allow users to plug in wallets and applications to run their traffic through its mixnet.    What is a mixnet?    Nym is a start-up software project working to obscure metadata tracking at a network level via the mixnet it enables. The mixnet itself is hosted by a decentralized network of volunteers.      On a normal internet network, most traffic can be tracked. Browsers like Tor offer a degree of protection against network surveillance by running traffic through a number of relays to obscure a user's location and usage. Such networks are still susceptible to metadata observation, however, meaning highly capable adversaries like the National Security Agency in the U.S. are able to see the timing of data packages being sent across a network to get an idea of what’s going on, even if they can’t see the actual contents of the packages.      It’s like when the NSA was tracking alleged terrorists’ phone calls in the U.S. While they weren’t eavesdropping on the calls themselves, they were looking at those involved in the calls as well as the duration of the calls and other details.      See also: Road to Consensus: Harry Halpin Talks Holistic Privacy, Mixnets and COVID-19 (of Course)      A mix network or ""mixnet,"" on the other hand, (taking its name from the proxy servers it employs, called “mixes”) obscures the metadata left behind when data passes through a network.      “In a mixnet all the data packets get shuffled around, and then it's emitted in a different order than [how] they came in, with a small delay,” said Dave Hrycyszyn, CTO of Nym. “Basically a mixnet acts like a game of Yahtzee, where the dice are data packs, they get shaken around on the mixnet and come out in an entirely different manner than they went in.""      Doing that multiple times, said Hrycyszyn, makes it impossible for an attacker monitoring all the network traffic on the internet to see who's communicating with whom.    Incentives paid in bitcoin    Nym has largely been focusing on its testnet, with node operators hosting them as a labor of love. Now, Nym will compensate operators using bitcoin. One way it offers rewards is through L-BTC on the Liquid sidechain using the Blockstream Green wallet. Liquid offers on-chain privacy using confidential transactions, which obscure the amounts being paid. For those who don’t have or want a Blockstream Green wallet, Nym will reward operators with BTC because Nym doesn’t want to force anyone to adopt a particular wallet. It will also be launching an incentivized bounty program to test the network's strength.      Nym is also launching its own reputation system, NYMPH, which lets it and node operators keep track of which mixnodes are online and mixing data packs, even across multiple chains.      The company is also adding greater functionality for running transactions and web traffic over its mixnet.      Read more: Europe Debates COVID-19 Contact Tracing That Respects Privacy      “Nym is plug-and-play replacement for Tor for any wallet that supports SOCKS5, or any application that supports SOCKS5,” said Nym CEO Harry Halpin.      For example, the Nym team has streamed video through Firefox on the network, though Halpin says that is still experimental at this point.      SOCKS is a protocol that exchanges network packets between device and server via a proxy.      “What Nym does is, just like Tor, start a SOCKS5 client up on your local machine. You send all your traffic from the app there. It transforms it into Sphinx packets (the same format Lightning uses, but invented for mixnets) and sends the traffic through the Nym mixnet,” he said.    ‘A step forward’ for privacy    Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream, said in a statement that Nym’s mixnet technology looks promising as a modern upgrade to Tor and is a step forward in terms of privacy.      “Network privacy is a crucial component to ensuring the financial privacy of Bitcoin users, so we were very happy to collaborate with Nym on its integration with Liquid,” he said.      “Nym’s SOCKS5 architecture made adding Blockstream Green wallet support easy, and we’ll keep an eye on the project with a view to adding standalone support in the future.”      Read more: New Malware Spotted in the Wild That Puts Cryptocurrency Wallets at Risk      These are important steps for mixnets, which aren’t in regular use right now and are traditionally fairly slow and clunky. The slowness is in part due to disrupting the timing of data packet delivery to foil network-level observers.      Nym recognizes that while this is important progress, it’s not a privacy panacea. At least, not yet.      “We do not recommend depending on the Nym mixnet for strong privacy yet,” said Hrycyszyn in a post announcing the updates. “We are working to get sender and receiver anonymity coded up, after which a full audit will be needed. But we are making very steady progress, and we invite you to try the mixnet today and give us feedback about how things go.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/09/10/privacy-startup-nym-will-pay-you-in-bitcoin-to-run-its-mixnet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/02d7aaab1ef259e773cd2807a04b2b6c8bb6ffd9-1500x1025.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405034,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKebE,1599765516,DeFi Mania Proves We Learned Nothing From the ICO Run-Up,"Last week, the eminent anthropologist and co-founder of the Occupy movement, David Graeber, passed away aged just 59. His tome on the origins of money and finance, “Debt: The First 5,000 Years,” should be required reading for anyone involved in crypto. Ranging from Mesopotamia to Manhattan, just about every page is filled with a salutary lesson or insightful parable on how over the millennia value came to be represented in either physical form or on a credit and debit ledger.      Take this from Page 348. Detailing Londoner’s stock mania following the meteoric rise of the South Sea Company of the early 1700s, Graeber quotes this contemporary account of one of the many very profitable start-up stock swindles that followed in its wake.      “The most absurd and preposterous of all [the schemes] which showed more completely than any other, the utter madness of the people, was one started by an unknown adventurer entitled, ‘A company for the carrying on of an undertaking of great advantage but nobody to know what it is’.""      The entrepreneur promised that for 100 British pounds (GBP) a share, investors would earn dividends of 100 GBP per year thereafter – an amazing return, which in theory should have left everyone incredulous.    Shiv Malik is the author of two books, the co-founder of the Intergenerational Foundation think tank and a former investigative journalist for the Guardian. He currently evangelizes about a new decentralized data economy for the open source project Streamr.    And yet, by the first morning of the “IPO” in London’s Cornhill (its original financial center) the man had raised deposits of 2,000 GBP to secure a fifth of all the stock – the fear of missing out was simply too great. Of course, by that evening, the entrepreneur had gotten on a boat to Europe and was never heard from again.      Graeber writes that if the story is true then “the entire population of London conceived the simultaneous delusion, not that money could really be manufactured out of nothing, but that other people were foolish to believe that it could – and that by that very fact, they actually could make money out of nothing after all.”      See also: Redel/Andoni - DeFi Is Just Like the ICO Boom and Regulators Are Circling      To anyone following the DeFi tumult, all this should sound disturbingly familiar. Rather like the South Sea Bubble, the DeFi bubble may have just gone pop. Certainly there are those with egg (or sushi) on their faces, and others who seemed to have fled with the loot.      At the heart of the Defi attraction lies the ability for people to make extraordinary returns (25% per year) simply by becoming a lender. The promise from the platforms has been that lendings are safe: smart contracts will guarantee collateralization of more than 1:1. In other words, more money is locked into a platform than is being lent out at any given moment.      As people hopped from platform to platform looking for the best rates to “lend” their crypto, a new term – yield farming – popped into existence to give the whole enterprise a feeling that “real” work was being done. You, too, the subconscious messaging went, could be back on the land, wholesomely farming on a wide-open digital prairie. A classic hipster fantasy was being realized. Digital nerds could finally, like their grandparents before them, engage in authentic, meaningful work.    Trying to make money out of nothing by believing other people will fall for the trick is, in the end, still trying to make money out of nothing.    And yet, few have wanted to zoom out and ask the simplest question: What is actually going on to make lenders so rich with credit card-style interest rates? What real value is being provided by all this money sloshing around? Or to put it in 18th century terms, what is the “great advantage” here that is powering the money making machine?      The two main advantages to DeFi seem to be tax avoidance and providing liquidity to borrowers.      Let’s take tax avoidance. How does that work? Under most tax systems, profitably cashing out of an asset creates tax liabilities. So being able to hold that asset while simultaneously being able to borrow against it reduces your tax liability while creating liquidity in another asset. Investor 1, Taxman 0.      But at the macro level (and despite what accountants may tell you) avoiding tax isn’t actually “useful work.” It’s just avoiding investments and payment for services of one sort (the government kind) over those preferred by an individual – most likely further investment liquidity for another crypto asset.      See also: Shiv Malik - Data Ownership Should Be About Software, Not Lawsuits      So is lending money real work? Well, lending is of great value to an economy. But only when the lender is assessing whether the money is being plowed into something that itself produces value. U.S. and U.K. banks used to do this sort of thing fairly well, especially for businesses, but no longer.      DeFi platforms are even worse at it because the decentralized nature of these platforms means the purposes for why people borrow can’t in fact be checked. That’s the whole point. There is no central party to do the checking. So where is all that borrowed money going to, to create those fabulous interest rate yields? As best as anyone can guess, more token speculation.      It’s worth remembering here that the 1930s Wall Street crash was brought about in part because banks were opening lines of credit to individuals so they could go on to invest in shares. That pumped up the prices, which only served to make even more people eager to borrow more money. It was classic bubble behavior and later outlawed. Of course, the same thing is happening now on Wall Street with quantitative easing (QE). It’s just that the funds are restricted to those closest to the money printers. (Printers switched on to avoid mass investor bankruptcies the last time speculation went off the charts.)      So in both cases, DeFi is fueling the behavior of traders. Is that real work? If they are day traders and not long-term investors (which is highly likely; otherwise, why borrow at such high rates?) then the only work that is being done at a systemic level is to ensure a more accurate price for an asset. People win and lose money based on what they think others think that price should be.      See also: William Mougayar - For DeFi to Grow, CeFi Must Embrace It      For assets underpinned by huge economies, getting such prices right is very useful work. In that respect, stock markets, and the various financial by-products that are created from them, have genuine value. But what if there is no real economy under the assets? What if a lot of money is being pumped in to determine the price of a business or software project that doesn’t itself have a business model, revenue, consumer interest or any sort of foreseeable use? And, in that case, how much speculation is too much speculation? What, in other words, if there’s no actual coffee under all that froth?      Given 2017’s initial coin offering (ICO) mania, you'd think those in the space would have learned a lesson. Instead, we’re here once more nursing bruises born of foolishness. And it’s likely that this isn’t done yet because believers need to believe. And god knows that you have to be a believer to exist in crypto. All those food-branded DeFI lending platforms have done to date is pump up various fantasies on offer.      Like the investors of 18th century London, Graeber’s wisdom would serve us all well.

The global cryptocurrency exchange giant is putting up $100 million to support DeFi projects on BSC.    Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao announced the plan during the company’s World of DeFi summit on Thursday. It's a “bridge” between DeFi and CeFi, an integration between Binance, the exchange, and BSC, the Binance-owned public chain.  Binance’s users can benefit from elements of CeFi – futures, margins, savings, DeFi staking and DeFi pooling – and DeFi – lending, automated market makers, liquidity mining, yield farming – according to the company’s news release Thursday.  This new plan targets Binance users who want to participate in DeFi without leaving the centralized platform.  Under the new platform, holders of Binance’s native token, BNB, can have more rights to the decentralized governance of the BSC, which uses a Proof-of-Stake Authority (PoSA) consensus mechanism, when they participate in staking on the BSC.  Since the popular crypto exchange first ventured into DeFi with its decentralized exchange in April 2019, Binance has continued expanding its footprint in this space.  Earlier this month, Binance introduced a product called Launchpool to provide users a way to make income by staking tokens for yield farming – the trendy strategy to make profits in DeFi.

OFAC alleges that the three individuals, Artem Lifshits, Anton Andreyev and Darya Aslanova, are employees of the Internet Research Agency (IRA), a Russian company and ""troll farm"" that tries to influence events. The IRA attempted to influence the 2018 midterm elections in the U.S., and OFAC alleged Thursday that this work continued.      ""The IRA uses cryptocurrency to fund activities in furtherance of their ongoing malign influence operations around the world,"" a press release said.      A separate release listed 23 crypto addresses as being added to OFAC's sanctions list, meaning any U.S. person who tries to send or receive money from these accounts might be subject to criminal proceedings. The wallets contained a slew of cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, ether, zcash, dash, bitcoin SV and litecoin, according to the OFAC press statement.      The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) separately charged Lifshits with wire fraud, alling he is part of ""Project Lakhta,"" an election interference effort based in Russia. According to the DOJ, Lifshits opened ""fraudulent accounts"" at banks and cryptocurrency exchanges by stealing U.S. citizens' identities.

Darren Soto (D-Fla.) – sponsor of a number of legislative proposals around blockchain technology – is accepting cryptocurrency donations for his reelection campaign.    Soto made the announcement during the U.S. Blockchain Debate on Wednesday, hosted by Soto's campaign and the Chamber of Digital Commerce PAC.  Donations will be processed by payments processor BitPay, with eight different cryptocurrency options supported for conversion into U.S. dollars.  Those include bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), ether (ETH), Gemini dollar (GUSD), USD Coin (USDC), Paxos standard (PAX), Binance USD (BUSD) and XRP.  Soto has long been an advocate of blockchain technology, saying the government should support its use for business and consumers, according to a press release.  Soto, who is also a co-chair of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, said he was ""excited"" to host a crypto debate on the same day as a vote to pass parts of the Digital Taxonomy Act.  The proposal was ultimately passed and added to the wider Consumer Safety Technology Act.  This will now be debated in the House of Representatives.  The blockchain portion of the act would require the Federal Trade Commission to submit a report and recommendations to Congress on unfair or deceptive acts relating to digital assets, Soto's spokesperson told CoinDesk.

Top shelf    Digital adoption Singapore-based DBS Bank thinks the coronavirus pandemic may speed adoption of digital assets, according to a quarterly report filed in August. “Post-pandemic [investing] is beyond speculative. It’s more about, ‘This thing has fixed circulation, it will not be debased.’ People are worried about dollar outflow and wondering if they should hold crypto in addition to gold as a safe-haven currency,” DBS Chief Economist Taimur Baig told CoinDesk. Baig also noted how cryptocurrencies can help to understand the dynamics of dollar-pegged currencies, while blockchain-tied CBDCs are another front in the politicized battle between the U.S. and China, CoinDesk’s Ian Allison reports.      Ripple scams Ripple has contested YouTube’s claims that it knew nothing about the XRP “giveaway” scams, in an attempt to keep its ongoing court case against the platform on the docket. In a motion filed Tuesday, responding to YouTube’s attempt to dismiss the suit, Ripple said it sent 350 takedown notices to YouTube regarding XRP scams using its logo and likeness of CEO Brad Garlinghouse to extort millions from unsuspecting investors. YouTube is accused of ""willful blindness,"" with Ripple alleging it disregarded or ignored explicit warnings about the scams happening on its platform,” CoinDesk report Paddy Baker said.      Trade war? Crypto firms and investors may avoid the brunt of the trade war between China and the U.S. In recent months sanctions employed by both countries have interrupted the flow of capital between the nations’ tech industries – affecting non-crypto startups. Decentralized ownership structure and unique fundraising models makes crypto projects immune to geopolitical risks, said Sharlyn Wu, chief investment officer at Huobi. Jump Trading, Paradigm and Pantera are among the U.S.-based firms that successfully invested in Hong Kong crypto startups, while Hashkey participated in BlockFi’s Series C.      Web3 Swisscom Blockchain, a distributed ledger technology startup owned by telco giant Swisscom, has been awarded a grant from the Web3 Foundation to build a cloud-based protection layer for stakers on the Polkadot network. Announced Thursday, the grant will help build Swisscom Blockchain’s Kubernetes Operator for Polkadot, a way of protecting participants involved in proof-of-stake processes on Polkadot and the Kusama testnet against losing their staked tokens if the network is attacked or compromised.      UPDATE (14 September 17:13 UTC): An earlier version of this paragraph erroneously conflated the Ethereum and Polkadot networks. We regret the error.      CBDC playground Payments giant Mastercard has released a platform that allows central banks to test how proposed central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) would work in real life. Mastercard announced Wednesday it had launched a virtual testing environment that can simulate issuance, distribution and exchange of CBDCs between banks and financial service providers, as well as end-consumers purchasing everyday goods and services. Raj Dhamodharan, Mastercard's executive VP, told Forbes his firm is already working with some central banks and that other entities, such as banks or tech firms, are being invited to use the platform.

SushiSwap, the vampire clone of Uniswap, successfully began porting over $800 million worth of tokens from its rival platform and instituting a temporary governance structure yesterday.      Nine signers of a multisig wallet controlling Sushi’s funds have been elected to govern SushiSwap through full decentralization, though it's unclear if all the nominees will accept their position.      These signatories will act like a board of directors in the analog world, CoinDesk’s Brady Dale reported, requiring six signees to approve changes to the SushiSwap code or to spend its development funds.      It’s a move that reflects Sushi’s original promise to create a community-run alternative to the most successful automated market maker (AMM), Uniswap. Functionally similar to the protocol it forked from, Sushi’s advantage was its decision to include a governance token, which is required for decentralized decision making.      While the results of this successful fork are still playing out, some assume there will be pressure for all DeFi projects to launch or implement a governance token, lest another vampire protocol emerge. Though it’s unclear if Sushi’s success will lead to Uniswap’s demise.      “Maybe the most fascinating observation of the Unisawp/Sushiswap saga so far is, that now BOTH platforms have more liquidity than Uniswap had before Sushi appeared,” Martin Köppelmann, founder of decentralized prediction market Gnosis, tweeted.      While SushiSwap is taking liquidity currently held by Uniswap, the majority of this capital was placed on Uniswap for the sole purpose of earning Sushi’s incentive program.      This morning, Uniswap is up $117 million in liquidity, or 46%, over where it was when SushiSwap was announced, Dale tweeted. Or, as author of “The Infinite Machine” Cami Russo said last night: Sushi is “growing the pie.”      Apart from the flood of liquidity ultimately destined for SushiSwap, Uniswap has been undergoing a spat of user interest.      CoinDesk’s Zack Voell reported the decentralized exchange has added 1,000 new token pairs in the past week. That equates to 150 pairs added per day.      Exponential growth in the number of tokens and pairs on Uniswap is “a good thing,"" according to Jack Purdy, decentralized finance analyst at Messari, as it “shows the power of a completely open, permissionless financial primitives.""    Market intel    Ether puts Ether (ETH) options traders are turning bearish, placing more than twice as many puts (bearish bets) than calls (bullish bets). Ether's put-call volume ratio – a measure of activity in put options relative to calls – rose to 2.45 on Wednesday, the highest level since Oct. 31, 2019, according to data source Skew. ""The message between the lines is likely that traders want a hedge [via put options] against the activity in DeFi, which has been the primary driver of ether prices,"" Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of Polychain Capital-backed derivatives exchange Alpha5, told CoinDesk.      Cash and carry BitMEX may be one of the largest crypto derivatives platforms, but it offers the lowest return on bitcoin “cash and carry” trades. Currently, the return offered by Seychelles-based BitMEX on a three-month basis is 2.71% annualized, half of what rival exchanges like Binance, FTX and Deribit are offering, according to data source Skew. Cash and carry arbitrage involves buying an asset in the spot market against a sell position in the futures market when the latter is trading at a premium to the spot price. Essentially, carry strategies profit from futures basis – the spread between prices in futures and spot markets – which evaporates on the day of the expiry.    Tech pod    Bitcoin bug A previously undisclosed vulnerability in the Bitcoin Core software could have allowed attackers to steal funds, delay settlements or split the largest blockchain network into conflicting versions had it not been quietly patched two years ago. Braydon Fuller, a protocol engineer at Purse, and Javed Khan, a core developer of the Handshake protocol, discovered the bug in June 2018, finding it affected Layer 2 (L2) solutions such as the Lightning Network but not Bitcoin full nodes. “While the vulnerability was fixed, its disclosure highlights the difficulties of building a global money standard on programming languages created by humans, not to mention the high technical barriers to engaging in development of the top cryptocurrency,” CoinDesk’s Will Foxley reports.      Frog’s vision? Twetch, a micropayment-based social network that runs on the Bitcoin SV blockchain, has introduced an encrypted direct-messaging function that lets users send each other money in the chat. Released Wednesday, Twetch Chat adds a layer of privacy and security to the Twitter alternative and is in line with a trend toward more private communications that have been a focus of companies in recent years. The service relies on Moneybutton or Relayx BSV wallets, and connects to the PayMail protocol, which creates an email-like ID – instead of the string of numbers and characters typically associated with a wallet.    How to    INX IPO How’s the first registered offering of security tokens in the U.S. going? CoinDesk’s Nathan DiCamillo shows you how to figure it out for yourself.      In the two weeks since INX Ltd. commenced its long-awaited initial public offering (IPO), more than 350 investors’ Ethereum addresses have been added to the “white list” of approved buyers. You don’t need to take the company’s word for it, it’s all on the blockchain, viewable through block explorer sites like Etherscan.      The public data doesn’t show who these registered investors are or how many of the tokens, priced at $0.90 each, any of them has agreed to buy. (INX is seeking to raise $117 million through the sale, which is expected to take several weeks to complete.)      But doing an IPO on-chain gives the public, and INX itself, a novel vista on the process, which traditionally has been a back-room affair.

42405022,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKbQS,1599753948,Square Forms Group to Stop Patent Hoarding From Stifling Crypto Innovation,"Jack Dorsey's payment company is inviting other cryptocurrency firms to join its ""alliance"" to pool patents and preserve the industry's open-source spirit.    Square said Thursday it has launched what it calls the Cryptocurrency Open Patent Alliance (COPA), a non-profit that wants to stop companies from locking up useful technologies in patents, a practice Square says hamstrings innovation.  ""Locking up foundational cryptocurrency technologies in patents stifles innovation and adoption; and offensive use of patents by bad actors threatens the growth of cryptocurrency technologies,"" Square said in a statement.  In addition to companies jealously guarding their own work in crypto, some firms go further, filing what are called ""pre-emptive patents"" for ideas they have no plans of developing but which act to hinder the research of competitors.  To become part of COPA, members must pledge to make their patents freely available to all other members using a shared library.  This library will act as a ""collective shield"" protecting members from ""patent aggressors,"" said Square – which ventured into crypto in 2018 and has already committed to putting its own crypto patents into the new library.  The only exception will be those filed to preserve existing patent applications.  The number of cryptocurrency and blockchain-related patents in the U.S. doubled between 2016 and 2017; in the past year, Microsoft filed a patent for a mining system powered by physical exertion and IBM for a token that is a ""self-aware.""  Assuming the patent library grows and gathers momentum, the idea is that more and more companies will look to join COPA to access tech innovations – creating a more equitable patent environment.  Any company that works in crypto, regardless of whether it has patents or not, will be eligible to join COPA.  COPA will be an entirely separate entity from Square, with its own independent board of directors, a spokesperson confirmed.

42405024,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKbTP,1599749644,The Revolution You've Been Awaiting: Fintech + DeFi,"Everything seems to be getting connected: finance, culture, art, technology, media, geopolitics. It is either a fantastic time to be working in our industry or we are slowly going nuts from information overexposure. Let's tug on a few strings as they relate to my thesis for what is happening next.      At the core of the answer is the question about the computing paradigm. How does software operate? Where does it operate? Who secures it? And, of course, in the spirit of our common interest, how does this impact financial infrastructure?    Lex Sokolin, a CoinDesk columnist, is Global Fintech co-head at ConsenSys, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based blockchain software company. The following is adapted from his Fintech Blueprint newsletter.    We know financial infrastructure is both (1) top-down, deriving from the powers of the state over money and the risk-taking institutions that are entrusted to safekeep such value and (2) individual human behaviors like paying, saving, trading, investing and insuring. Throughout time, people want to apply inter-temporal utility maximization functions (a measure of value depending on time) to their assets, then aggregations of people in super-organisms (i.e., corporations, municipalities) have the same financial needs.      Financial infrastructure is just our collective solution for enabling activities using the latest technology – whether that is language, paper, calculators, the cloud, blockchain, or some other reality-bending physical discovery. We have progressed from mainframe computers to standalone desktops and laptops running local software, to the magnificence and efficiency of cloud computing accessed through the interface of the mobile device, to now open source programmable blockchains secured by computational mining. These gears of computational machine enable core banking, portfolio management, risk assessment, and underwriting.    Some companies, like Fiserv or FIS, still provide software that runs on a mainframe (hi there, COBOL-based core banking), among other more modern activities. Some companies, like Envestnet, still support software that runs locally on your machine (see Schwab Portfolio Center acquisitionhttps://ir.envestnet.com/news-releases/news-release-details/envestnet-tamarac-announces-agreement-acquire-portfoliocenterr), among other more modern activities.    Let's be honest. This is last century stuff.      Today, all software should at the least be written to be executed from the cloud. You can see this thesis proven out by the massive revenues Google, IBM, Amazon and Microsoft generate in their financial cloud divisions. Technology firms should host technology; they are far better at this than financial institutions.      The venture capital strategies of embedded finance, open banking, the European Union's Payment Service Directive and API all revolve around the premise that banks are behind on cloud technology and do not know how to package and deliver financial products to where they matter. Financial products are purchased where customers live and experience them. That is no longer the branch, but the attention platforms and other digital brand experiences.      See also: Lex Sokolin - Software Ate the World, Here’s How It Eats Finance      Nobody has proven this out as well as Ant Financial, the Chinese fintech powerhouse. Proximity payments and QR-code based shopping rode the mobile and cloud networks of Alibaba. You would not be able to design this user experience, nor this attention platform, without a technology footprint that began with cloud computing and the internet.      It is less banking enablement software (i.e., the narrow ambition of banking-as-a-service), and more the data, media, and e-commerce experience of Amazon or Facebook, with financial product monetization included.    More than 60% of Ant's revenue comes from fintech product lead generation,https://www1.hkexnews.hk/app/sehk/2020/102484/documents/sehk20082500535.pdf with capital risks passed on to the underlying banks and insurers, which Ant also digitizes. Remember that the chassis for credit scoring comes from the tech giant and its artificial intelligence pointed at 700 million people and 80 million businesses, not the other way around from the banks. This therefore incorporates the types of enabling fintech that Refinitiv and Finastra dream about.  Programmable blockchain    So far we have abstracted all the complexities of actually standing up these operating businesses, and instead described them as financial infrastructure derivatives of the computing paradigm of the moment.This is based on the premise that people will always re-invent financial infrastructure, and use the tools of the time to make it over and over again.      As a comparison, we have always needed light, but the technology of light – from fire, to gas lamps, to incandescent bulbs, to LEDs – evolves progressively by ingesting new available scientific components. The next computing paradigm is running mutualized (i.e., open source, shared, communal) software on blockchain networks for digital assets.      In early 2017, I articulated a version of this thesis at Autonomous Research. In this scenario, a human relationship remains between the client and some representative of the financial product, whether that representative is a CFA-bearing Series 7 adviser at Goldman Sachs via Zoom or a superstar developer Andre Cronje via Twitter. There is a trust link and reputational capital. But, underneath that, the relationship is largely automated, AI-driven data gathering, which is normalized and processed into software that connects into blockchains, which is then underwritten by a financial firm.      ""Software Robots and Automated Workflows,"" in this current phase of fintech evolution, have become smart contracts on programmable blockchains. Ethereum, the leading such chain, experiences more than three million ""contract"" calls per day by its embedded software. Below is a chart, via Coin Metrics, of the machine humming along and doing ever more computational work. Certainly it is not the only programmable blockchain, with several solutions even sitting on top to create additional throughput capacity and scalability, such as Cosmos, OMG and SKALE.      What does the android dream about? In large part, financial infrastructure.      It dreams of digital asset trading on Uniswap, which for the first time in history experienced more trading volume with its 200,000 users than fintech unicorn Coinbase with its 30 million.      It dreams of asset management and market making, with financial robots composing automated trading and investment strategies on Yearn Finance. It dreams of 300,000 people creating their own investment plans on DeFi aggregator Zapper (chart link here). It dreams of liquidity runs between Uniswap and SushiSwap, of yield maximization and governance tokens, and Dadaist meme art in the form of the Based Protocol.    Convergence?    I have described worlds that today are quite different: the exponential innovation of DeFi, trying to outpace regulation and automate away human involvement, and the transformative reformatting that will happen to financial incumbents over time. As DeFi collateralized assets (TVL) approach $10 billion, one narrative we may see is that crypto is a completely separate, new sphere of economics and finance. It does not need to connect to the old world. It simply needs to be left alone to perform.      In some sense, the payments industry offers a comparison. Like comparing technology differences between crypto and fintech incumbents, one can compare the technology distinctions between physical cash, credit cards, e-commerce payment processors, NFC-based proximity payments and QR codes. Each has their own logic and sphere of influence. But, in reality, one usually feeds off the accomplishments of the other. Even Ant Financial today is directing its billion users to traditional capital providers, while leveraging modern user experiences.      Market cycles mean that blockchain investments shift between incumbent transformation budgets and crypto-native building and investment. One year, it is all about Bitcoin. The next, about distributed ledgers. The next, about ICOs. The next, about digital assets. The next, about DeFi. It does not take long to recognize the swing of the pendulum.      See also: Lex Sokolin - Your Crypto Startup Needs a Recession Strategy      To combat these demand swings, you need timeless principles. To this end, I see the DeFi protocols (like Maker, Aave, Compound, Yearn, Curve, Nexus Mutual) and applications evolving towards the natural financial behaviors turned into software: paying, saving, investing, trading, insuring. All that really needs to be done longer-term is to connect them in a risk-managed way to the existing economy. Startups like Centrifuge are leading the way.      That bridge can be expressed into the consumer footprint of wallets to help users achieve their financial goals, into the developer footprints of enabling software to help financial developers maintain their financial applications, and into institutional networks for novel structures across the trillions of GDP in financial economic activity. The speed of innovation is blinding, and who knows what fortune the market will provide us.

Last month’s $6.7 billion in traded volume was the leading decentralized exchange’s fourth consecutive all-time monthly high, as CoinDesk previously reported.  Curve, the second-largest decentralized exchange by traded volume, also surpassed August’s record of $1.87 billion Thursday, reaching $1.9 billion, according to Dune Analytics.  Liquidity on Uniswap, however, has dropped by over 60% to $619 million since Tuesday as the popular SushiSwap project successfully migrated from Uniswap to FTX’s decentralized exchange, Serum.  Coinciding with Uniswap’s exponential volume growth, market sentiment analysis by cryptocurrency research firm Markets Science shows similar increases in excitement over Ethereum and decentralized finance (DeFi).  For example, both the quantity of tweets referencing Ethereum and the percentage of those tweets coming from unique Twitter users have steadily increased over the past three months, reaching yearly highs toward the beginning of September, the Markets Science analysis shows.  Even as decentralized exchange volumes continue to grow, Ethereum transaction fees have dropped 75% from their record highs of $15.21 on Sept. 2.  The average transaction fee was $3.86 Thursday, according to Blockchair.  Notably, Uniswap is one of the few decentralized trading platforms without its own token.

42405014,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKbKY,1599744868,Blockchain Proposals Move to US House in Consumer Tech Bill,"Two blockchain proposals have been added to a wider piece of legislation on consumer protection after being passed by a U.S. congressional committee Wednesday.    The House Committee on Energy and Commerce passed a motion Wednesday to incorporate the Blockchain Innovation Act and part of the Digital Taxonomy Act into a broader Consumer Safety Technology Act.  This adds blockchain technology onto a list of emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), that the Department of Commerce (DoC) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) will be mandated to closely examine so as to identify any potential consumer risks.  The FTC would be required to file a report with recommendations to Congress on how best to address deceptive practices relating to digital tokens.  It would also call for a government study to be conducted to determine how technologies, such as blockchain, can combat fraud and other unfair or deceptive practices.  A statement from Representative Darren Soto (D-Fla.), the bills' sponsor, said the ultimate aim was to establish a Blockchain Center for Excellence within the DoC.  ""I believe our government needs to support that growth, establish light-touch regulations to ensure certainty, protect innovation, stop fraud and enable its appropriate use for government, business and consumers,"" Soto said.  This is believed to the furthest that a bill on blockchain has ever come in the U.S. Congress.  The new bill reflects similar comments made by the government's antitrust chief last week, who said blockchain technology deserves to be protected by law as it could help stop the formation of market monopolies.

""In a flash, investors have gone from running for the hills to buying the dip,"" Mati Greenspan, founder of the cryptocurrency and foreign-exchange analysis firm Quantum Economics, told clients in an email. The crypto investment firm Stack Funds wrote in a weekly report that prices appear to have found a temporary floor around $10,000.      Taimur Baig, chief economist for Singapore's DBS bank, told CoinDesk that the pandemic and the associated central-bank money-printing have strengthened the case for bitcoin. ""People are worried about dollar outflow and wondering if they should hold crypto in addition to gold as a safe-haven currency,” he said.      The European Central Bank said early Thursday it would keep monetary policy unchanged for now. European stocks were flat, and U.S. stock futures were lower.    Market Moves    The phenomenon of decentralized finance, known as DeFi, rose to a new level of surreal Wednesday as the semi-automated cryptocurrency trading platform SushiSwap used a technique known as ""vampire mining"" to suck liquidity away from its industry-leading rival.      As reported by CoinDesk's Brady Dale, the SushiSwap project appears to have extracted more than $800 million from Uniswap, which had recently risen to the top of the standings among DeFi projects.      Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of the FTX exchange, who took control over the SushiSwap project after its founder apparently cashed out some $13 million of tokens and exited, said the ""migration"" was complete. That's polite-speak for what really happened, namely that the project's design to siphon away liquidity from Uniswap appeared to have succeeded.      Prices for the SUSHI token, which started trading just two weeks ago, were up 11% to $2.69, for a total market value of about $260 million, according to the website CoinMarketCap.      Uniswap doesn't have its own tokens, but the website DeFi Pulse showed the protocol's collateral value plunging by about 74% to $388 million. It has dropped to ninth place in the DeFi rankings. SushiSwap isn't tracked by DeFi Pulse.      DeFi, the fast-growing industry of using cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology to build semi-automated lending and trading platforms that might someday replace banks, has seen its total collateral assets climb 10-fold this year to about $7 billion. It has moved so fast that even pros can barely keep up.      Eric Ervin, CEO of the cryptocurrency-focused hedge fund Blockforce Capital, wrote Thursday that the safest way to bet on the trend might just be to buy ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, where many of the DeFi projects are being developed.      ""We are believers in the long-term potential that DeFi offers for society,"" Ervin wrote. ""The genie is out of the bottle now. It will be difficult to imagine innovation stepping backward from here.""

But apparently traders are shy about bidding up futures prices on BitMEX, partly due to the exchange's practice of requiring initial collateral postings in bitcoin.      As reported Thursday by CoinDesk's Omkar Godbole, the practice exacerbates the rush to margin calls during a price decline and leads to faster liquidations.      One consequence of all this, according to Godbole, is that BitMEX's futures basis – the difference between spot prices and where futures are trading – is about 2.7%, about half the level observed on rival exchanges like Deribit, Binance and FTX. So returns will be lower for traders using arbitrage strategies to profit from the spread.      ""There is a residual risk market makers have if they get 'too long' on BitMEX,"" Patrick Heusser, senior cryptocurrency trader at Zurich-based crypto broker AG, told CoinDesk in a Twitter chat. ""Therefore, the general pricing of those futures is slightly lower compared to the multi collateral platforms.""    Bitcoin Watch    Both bitcoin and ether were consolidating in a narrow range, having found a strong support near $10,000 and $320, respectively, over the past few days.      ""Bitcoin fundamentals remain positive as hashrates are at all-time highs,"" analysts at Stack, cryptocurrency trackers, and index funds provider, said in their weekly research note. ""As such, the cryptocurrency's technical price floor will shift upwards.""      Meanwhile, ether's fortunes remain tied to the developments in the decentralized finance space. Ether's put-call volume ratio jumped to multi-month highs on Wednesday, indicating increased demand for put options or bearish bets.      ""It shows traders want a hedge [via put options] against the activity in DeFi, which has been the primary driver of ether prices,"" Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of Polychain Capital-backed derivatives exchange Alpha5, told CoinDesk.

42405015,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKbIa,1599739200,Why Crypto Investments Are Less Vulnerable to US-China Tensions,"With U.S.-China tensions continuing to burn, some investors are feeling the heat.      Friction between the world’s two largest economies has taken a toll on venture funds investing in non-crypto startups. Investment in the blockchain industry, however, may be less affected. Crypto companies’ unique fundraising processes and decentralized nature provide some protection from geopolitical risks, according to China-focused crypto and blockchain investors.      The Trump administration recently sanctioned Chinese officials because of Hong Kong’s new security law. Separately, the U.S. warned the global community against using Chinese technology and tried to force Chinese companies to sell parts of their business. Other western countries are beginning to follow suit. China has kicked out major American media outlets and closed the U.S. Consulate in Chengdu.      China-focused venture funds have seen low capital inflow due to investment restrictions on U.S. pension funds, while Chinese companies will have to go through a more rigorous vetting process if they wish to go public on Nasdaq or New York Stock Exchange in the U.S. This tightening comes on top of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has already taken a toll on cross-border investment.      Six U.S.-dollar funds with investments in China have looked to raise capital this year compared to 21 last year. The State Department has asked U.S. universities and colleges to divest their Chinese holdings due to stricter scrutiny from the Trump administration and potential delisting of all Chinese companies on U.S. exchanges. The warning came on the heels of a ban on Chinese short-video platform Tik Tok and Tencent’s messaging app WeChat.      While it is difficult to obtain comprehensive data on the scope of U.S.-China crypto investment, there have recently been a few notable deals. Jump Trading, a U.S.-based security and cryptocurrency market maker for Robinhood, announced Thursday it would invest in decentralized exchange Serum, which has a large presence in Hong Kong. California-based funds Paradigm and Pantera led a $28 million Series A round in Hong Kong crypto startup Amber Group in February. Meanwhile, Hong Kong-based blockchain investment firm Hashkey participated in crypto lender Blockfi’s $50 million Series C in August.      Due to more lenient regulations on crypto trading and financial convenience in Hong Kong, some Chinese crypto and blockchain funds and crypto firms are based there rather than in mainland China. Companies might headquarter themselves in Hong Kong to take advantage of its regulatory regime and status in the financial world, when they are actually from, or subsidiaries of companies in, mainland China.    Decentralization    The White House recently directed a retirement savings fund to stop investing in Chinese companies, citing threats to national security. But these restrictions don’t necessarily pose a threat to crypto startups.      “A pension fund might find a hard time in allocating assets but it is a broad phenomenon that those funds do not invest in crypto regardless of the U.S.-China relations,” says Haseeb Qureshi, managing partner at Dragonfly Capital Partners, an Asia-focused crypto venture capital based in San Francisco.      Typical institutional investors for crypto and blockchain funds are crypto exchanges and the investment firms that don’t receive capital for large pension funds or endowments, Qureshi said.      Read more: China Aims to Be the World’s Dominant Blockchain Power – With Help From Google, Amazon and Microsoft      Decentralized ownership structure makes crypto projects immune to geopolitical risks, said Sharlyn Wu, chief investment officer at Huobi, one of the largest crypto exchanges by volume in the world.      “Community-driven projects, especially the decentralized fiance protocols such as YFI, have a tendency to [avoid] venture capital firms,” Wu said.      Venture funds normally take a stake in a firm and help it grow its business, something not possible with decentralized projects, Wu said.      “However, crypto is about the decentralized network and you can’t really track down a particular group of people in a country,” she said.    National pride    Western crypto projects often appeal to Chinese investors.      “Historically, there are relatively more innovative crypto projects from the West in general and these projects would attract investment from the East where they tend to have more liquidity,” said Omer Ozden, CEO of RockTree Capital, an investment firm with a focus on blockchain technology in Asia.      “Chinese crypto investors are very enthusiastic and active, reflecting the FOMO (Fear of Missing Out ) phenomenon.”      But in China, political tensions occasionally bleed into the business sphere. If Chinese investors start favoring homegrown projects, that could spell trouble for U.S. crypto projects.      “The tension in some way increases the viability of the Chinese crypto teams,” Qureshi said. “In part it means there would be more willingness within China to support some of the homegrown Chinese projects.”      Read more: A WeChat Ban Should Be the Moment for Decentralized Tech. But It’s Not.      There have been a slew of incidents where foreign companies have faced Chinese nationalist wrath because of political events.      In 2008, Chinese consumers protested French supermarket chain Carrefour when pro-Tibet Independence protestors snatched the torch during the Olympic relay in France. Last October, the National Basketball Association (NBA) took heat from China because of a tweet from Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, who posted an image that supported protesters in Hong Kong.      While crypto is not fully shielded from political controversy, it helps that startups are not necessarily associated with one particular country. The crypto community is decentralized and global from the get-go and it is unlikely that it will be affected for geopolitical reasons, Wu said.      “If your project is genuinely innovative, it will transcend beyond culture and languages,” she said.    Strategic technology    One of the reasons why the U.S. wants to ban TikTok and WeChat is because they have so much data from American users. Permissionless blockchains, by contrast, aim to avoid the problem of honeypots of personal data.      “The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has not touched crypto,” Qureshi said. “On a broader level, the U.S. just doesn't see crypto or blockchain in particular as a strategic threat and we have pretty much shielded from any of that nonsense.”      Even if there is a massive amount of data on a decentralized public blockchain, such projects decrease the reliance on one company, such as Facebook or Tik Tok.      Read more: China’s Digital Currency May Come With Hardware Wallets as Well      “You don’t need to trust anyone and you can just trust the code,” Wu said. “The code is open-source and on-chain. Everyone can check it out.”      However, there are limitations on this decentralization, even for public blockchains. Some of the platforms will need to store their users’ data through centralized cloud service providers such as Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services and Alibaba Cloud, which are subject to potential government surveillance. A government could also shut down a blockchain-based platform by cutting its Internet services in the country.    Enterprise blockchain    Compared to public decentralized blockchains, enterprise blockchains led by particular entities are more vulnerable to geopolitical tensions.      Any centralized businesses, including those that develop enterprise blockchain, are subject to local regulatory and legal requirements as much as any other regular tech firms, Wu said.      Enterprise blockchain, which is also called permissioned or private blockchain, has been widely used for data management such as record tracking, and comes with smart contracts that enable automated financial services transactions. They are typically governed by a small group of companies and only a handful of people have access to the data stored on-chain.      See also: The Latest on the Global Economy’s Most Contentious Relationship      Various tech conglomerates have developed their own enterprise blockchains, including IBM-backed Hyperledger, Ablibaba’s Ant Chain and Baidu’s XuperChain. The Chinese government is a major supporter of permissioned blockchain technology, and the Beijing municipal government recently launched a blockchain-based platform. Supported by Huawei Cloud, it will be able to manage data ranging from medical records to property registration.      Although Chinese enterprise blockchain technology has not yet met with any political resistance for U.S. legislators, experts warned those projects will face higher policy risks if they achieve mass adoption and gather more user data in the future.      For example, the state-sanctioned blockchain infrastructure project Blockchain-Based Service Network (BSN), uses American cloud services providers such as Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud to store data for the global version of its network.

Announced Thursday, the grant will help build Swisscom Blockchain's Kubernetes Operator for Polkadot, a way of protecting participants involved in proof-of-stake processes on Polkadot and the Kusama testnet against losing their staked tokens if the network is attacked or compromised.      Something like a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS), for instance, leads to downtime and can mean a validator blockchain node can have its stake slashed. Preventing this is tricky – hence the need for a system of cloud-based ""containers"" and ""sentry nodes,"" which can isolate validators while maintaining node connections.      The size of the grant was not disclosed. A spokesman for Web3 Foundation said that grant teams are allowed to apply in private via a General Grants Program.      ""The Web3 grant was awarded to contribute to the Polkadot ecosystem by submitting an open-source repository that other startups and enterprises can use to setup/manage their own infrastructure in an automated way while providing security best practices for resources hosted in the enterprise,” Jorge Alvarado, Swisscom Blockchain's head of technology, said via email.

42405025,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKbUO,1599736674,Ether Traders May Be Hedging Against DeFi Slowdown: Analyst,"Options market data shows increased activity in ether (ETH) puts, or bearish bets. According to one trader, that reflects fears of a drop in prices led by a slump in decentralized finance (DeFi).    Ether's put-call volume ratio – a measure of activity in put options relative to calls (bullish bets) – rose to 2.45 on Wednesday.  That's the highest level since Oct. 31, 2019, according to data source Skew.  In other words, more than two put options were traded against every call option – a sign of bearish market sentiment.  ""The message between the lines is likely that traders want a hedge [via put options] against the activity in DeFi, which has been the primary driver of ether prices,"" Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of Polychain Capital-backed derivatives exchange Alpha5, told CoinDesk.  Indeed, some commentators believe DeFi's staggering growth has become a price bubble and is unsustainable.  ""DeFi is a rerun of the 2008 asset-backed finance bubble on speed,"" blockchain consultant Maya Zehavi tweeted on Wednesday.  The space faces other issues, too, such as congestion and soaring ""gas"" fees on Ethereum resulting from heavy network usage by DeFi projects and stablecoins.  In August, miners made over $110 million from fees, according to data source Glassnode.  Alongside a general crypto market downturn, the total value locked in the DeFi applications has declined sharply from $9.6 billion to $6.11 billion in the past eight days, according to DeFi Pulse.  Ether's price fell from $480 to $320 last week.  However, investors expect deeper price drops, if any, to be short-lived because call options expiring in three and six months are still drawing higher prices than puts.  The one-month put-call skew, which measures the cost of puts relative to calls, is currently seen at 6.8%, indicating an increased demand for bearish put options.  But the three- and six-month skews remain well below zero, implying long-term bullish expectations.  At press time, ether is trading near $365.

42405011,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKbGc,1599734407,"YouTube Ignored Warnings About XRP 'Giveaway' Scams, Ripple Says","Ripple has disputed YouTube's claims that it knew nothing about the XRP ""giveaway"" scams, accusing the platform of ""willful blindness"" after being alerted hundreds of times.    Ripple took action against YouTube in April, holding the platform responsible for the multiple videos that used its logo and the likeness of CEO Brad Garlinghouse to promote scams that ask victims to send XRP in order to be eligible for a larger amount that, of course, never arrives.  YouTube filed a motion to dismiss the suit in July, arguing it didn't knowingly engage in any scams and that, as an online platform, it can't be held liable for third-party content.  But in a response to YouTube's motion, filed Tuesday, Ripple contested this claim.  The blockchain payments firm argued that the 350 takedown notices it sent to Youtube mean it knew all about the scams but opted not to act, or only did so weeks or months later.  YouTube is accused of ""willful blindness,"" with Ripple alleging it disregarded or ignored explicit warnings about the scams happening on its platform.  At its worst, multiple giveaway scams were uploaded to YouTube every day, some receiving tens of thousands of views in a matter of hours.  Ripple claims users were defrauded of millions of XRP, worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, and the company suffered serious reputational damage as a result of YouTube's failure to act.  The filing also alleges YouTube profited from earning ad revenue from the scam videos and ""materially contributed"" to the situation by giving a verified ""tick"" to one of the giveaway channels.  Ripple isn't the only company accusing YouTube of not doing enough to stop such scams.  Apple founder Steve Wozniak, along with 18 other plaintiffs, is also seeking punitive damages from the platform for bitcoin scam videos that also used his likeness.

42405026,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKbWM,1599732000,Structural Issues May Be Causing BitMEX’s Low Bitcoin 'Cash and Carry' Returns,"BitMEX may be one of the largest crypto derivatives platforms, but it offers the lowest return on bitcoin ""cash and carry"" trades.      Currently, the return offered by Seychelles-based BitMEX on a three-month basis is 2.71% annualized, half of what rival exchanges like Binance, FTX and Deribit are offering, according to data source Skew.      Cash and carry arbitrage involves buying an asset in the spot market against a sell position in the futures market when the latter is trading at a premium to the spot price. Essentially, carry strategies profit from futures basis – the spread between prices in futures and spot markets – which evaporates on the day of the expiry.    Bitcoin as BitMEX's sole collateral    BItMEX's policies and recent history appear to have affected traders’ behavior, thus keeping rates low on BitMEX relative to other platforms.      ""We believe that the difference in the BitMEX premium relates to their single collateral offering,"" Patrick Heusser, senior cryptocurrency trader at Zurich-based Crypto Broker AG, told CoinDesk in a Twitter chat.      BitMEX only accepts bitcoin as collateral, meaning traders can pay or receive margin, profit and loss solely in bitcoin. As such, when the market drops, the collateral loses value, forcing longs to exit by taking offsetting positions. That, in turn, leads to bigger price decline and more ""long liquidations,"" a forced unwinding of buy positions akin to what can happen in a margin call on traditional futures exchanges.      ""During the March sell-off, the network was clogged up, and the liquidation cascade drove prices lower at a faster pace. Assuming it was a closed ecosystem, the danger was that bitcoin's price on the BitMEX platform could have gone to zero, resulting in a complete wipeout of collateral value and all open positions,"" Heusser said.      On March 12, bitcoin fell by nearly 40% to levels below $4,000. The sudden decline, which began from around $7,800, triggered record buy-sell liquidations worth $876 million on BitMEX. These forced closures likely aggravated the price drop.      Hence, traders are less aggressive in building long on BitMEX as compared to other exchanges like FTX, where they can pledge stablecoins and cryptocurrencies as collateral. That helps mitigate risk arising from sudden price collapse.      ""There is a residual risk market makers have if they get 'too long' on BitMEX. Therefore, the general pricing of those futures is slightly lower compared to the multi-collateral platforms,"" said Heusser.    Other platforms    Binance, the leading global cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, launched a cross-collateral program on its futures platform earlier this year. The feature allows users to trade futures using crypto assets from their Binance Exchange Wallet as collateral, without having to sell any coins.      Deribit, the biggest exchange by options volume, also offers a single collateral mechanism like BitMEX. Even so, the futures' basis on Deribit is significantly higher compared to BitMEX.      That's possibly due to differences in liquidation mechanisms.      On Deribit, positions are liquidated incrementally. ""The position will be liquidated in fractional steps to avoid unnecessary reductions, on condition that partial liquidation ensures the margin balance is above the required maintenance margin level,” according to the official blog. A full liquidation occurs as the trader's margin balance is below the maintenance margin.      That incremental liquidation allows traders to express their bullish view more aggressively, causing futures premium to widen. BitMEX does not offer a partial or incremental liquidation mechanism.    BitMEX's large market share    Further, BitMEX's high trading volume and order book depth could be responsible for the low basis compared to Deribit.      As of Tuesday, BitMEX accounted for 14% of the global bitcoin futures trading volume of $16 billion, while Deribit contributed just 2%, according to data source Skew. Further, at BitMEX, the average daily spread between buy and sell orders on bitcoin futures for $10 million quote size is currently 0.4% versus 2.94% on Deribit.      That said, the low basis on BitMEX does not represent low credit risk. If anything, it indicates the opposite due to the single-collateral structure.",NEGATIVE,없음,BCH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/09/10/structural-issues-may-be-causing-bitmexs-low-bitcoin-cash-and-carry-returns,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d0f3709bc372b6554a0cc4ca0102d1194fa3fcec-1920x1281.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405013,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKbJZ,1599728648,Australian University Finds Privacy Issues With Blockchain Technology,"A research paper from the University of South Australia suggests blockchain technology needs to be refined so it can better protect privacy.    Described in a university blog post on Thursday, the research findings show the very features that make blockchain secure are also problematic for personal privacy, particularly under European standards.  The work was conducted by emerging technologies doctoral researcher Kirsten Wahlstrom in collaboration with Anwaar Ulhaq and Oliver Burmeister of Charles Sturt University, also in Australia.  The team found emerging technologies such as blockchain and the internet of things possess the potential to compromise people’s privacy in the way they immutably store data.  That's because blockchains use details of previous transactions, including data that can be used to identify participants, to verify future transactions.  “Once someone’s details are embedded in a blockchain, the system never forgets,"" Wahlstrom said. ""Yes, those details might be encrypted, but they are also part of an irreversible ledger, and one that’s on the cloud.""  The paper references recent legal developments in the European Union meaning citizens possess the ""right to be forgotten"" in relation to their internet-hosted data.  So, as long as a blockchain exists it conflicts with the European ruling that people have the right to retract their data, Wahlstrom said.  In August, digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation raised similar concerns over a proposed California law allowing medical records to be stored on a blockchain.  Standards need to be cemented now in order develop a clear distinction on what privacy is, as well as what governments and organizations are trying to protect and why, Wahlstrom noted.  ""The main problem is, we’re still struggling to understand what 'privacy' actually means in an online world,"" she added.  The research cited Holochain as an example of technology that might address the privacy issue.  The project uses distributed hash tables, a form of a distributed database that can record data associated with a key on a network of peer nodes, and avoids the all-encompassing ""ledger"" of a blockchain.  “This allows individuals to verify data without disclosing all its details or permanently storing it in the cloud,"" Wahlstrom said, ""but there are also still a lot of questions to answer about how this affects the long-term viability of the chain and how it obtains verifications.”    See also: Blockchain Privacy Firm HOPR Releases Mixnet Hardware Node for Ethereum",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET | RESEARCH,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/09/10/australian-university-finds-privacy-issues-with-blockchain-technology,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/22704ba8362cf2fede1a55987e9f52fe48dcc1cd-1500x872.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405020,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKbPT,1599705921,"Pandemic Will Speed Bitcoin Adoption, Says DBS Bank Economist","“A pandemic-led acceleration of adoption.”      That’s how Singapore-based DBS Bank describes the current state of digital assets in its quarterly report on cryptocurrencies published in August.      It’s interesting to hear such an observation from a respected multinational bank and its chief economist, Taimur Baig. However, there have lately been murmurings about certain large financial institutions – particularly in places like Singapore, Switzerland and Germany – fielding a new wave of demand for crypto, filtering through from smaller private banks and wealthy clients.      On the subject of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC), Baig identified two distinct phases of demand: pre-pandemic and post-pandemic.      “Pre-pandemic demand was largely speculative. People saw bitcoin had a spectacular run and wanted to be part of that game, so what’s wrong with putting in 1% of assets under management [into BTC],” Baig said in an interview. “But I think post-pandemic is beyond speculative. It’s more about, ‘This thing has fixed circulation, it will not be debased.’ People are worried about dollar outflow and wondering if they should hold crypto in addition to gold as a safe-haven currency.”      Read more: Bitcoin’s Correlation With Gold Hits Record High      DBS isn’t the only bank to notice this trend. Switzerland-based digital asset bank Sygnum, which holds a banking license from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, echoed this view.      “Since the outbreak of COVID-19 there has been increased interest from family offices and private individuals who see digital assets as an alternative and a way to protect against a worrying inflation risk,” said Martin Burgherr, co-head of clients at Sygnum Bank. “Now that banks are awakening from the lockdown, we have had a significant uptick in national and international banks asking us to help in a B2B setup, to enable their clients to invest in digital assets.”    Digital gold    Baig – who has previously held senior economist roles at the Monetary Authority of Singapore, Deutsche Bank and the International Monetary Fund – likes to zoom out and take a macro view of digital currencies and the potential play of central bank digital currencies (CBDC).      There has been a steady rise in gold, while fixed-income yields are heading towards zero, Baig said, and such conditions have also caused “bitcoin to come back quite convincingly.”      Read more: PTJ on BTC: Bitcoin Is Now the Macro Big Bet      It’s tempting to look at bitcoin through the lens of foreign exchange (FX), as yet another currency with an exchange rate against the U.S. dollar. But this is mistaken, Baig said, since a regular sovereign currency has accepted economic means of evaluation that determine productivity and long-term growth.      “You can’t value cryptocurrencies like that,” Baig said. “While they can have this credibility with a system-based circulation, they’re still not attached to a country’s fortune. So, of course, they will not go and up and down the way the U.S. economy goes up and down. From that perspective, it’s more akin to gold than an FX in my view.”    Dollar pegging    For countries experiencing a currency crisis or episode of hyperinflation, pegging to the U.S. dollar may bring some short-term credibility, but it doesn’t work out well for a lot of currencies, Baig noted, adding:    “If you look at Venezuela or even Lebanon, which is in the middle of a massive financial crisis, could you, at some point going forward, conceive that instead of linking your currency to the U.S. dollar, you link it to a cryptocurrency?”    Provided that transactions can be viewed on the blockchain there are possibilities, said Baig. “As long as it’s tied to a limited-circulation currency, I see some similarities between that sort of anchoring versus anchoring against the US. dollar,” he said.    Digitizing the redback    The topic of CBDCs is also highly politicized, particularly between the U.S. and China.      There are two dimensions to think about when it comes to China and its CBDC efforts at “digitizing the redback,” said Baig. Firstly, a digital renminbi (e-RMB) is a way that China’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), can exercise some control over the country’s sprawling fintech ecosystem.      “There’s so much going on at the Alipay, Tencent level,” Baig said. “Deposits are being made by those fintechs, they are extending credit, so it doesn’t really matter what PBoC does with respect to interest rates. It’s like a whole parallel universe.”      Read more: China’s Digital Currency May Come With Hardware Wallets as Well      The other dimension concerns the potential for an e-RMB to become a way for certain countries to bypass the U.S. dollar settlement mechanism, which makes them “somehow answerable to the Southern District [Court] in New York"" or the Securities and Exchange Commission,” said Baig.      “The U.S. dollar has been used repeatedly as a weapon against Iran against other countries and also against China,” he said. “I think now with U.S.-China tensions so high the case for e-RMB becomes even more compelling.”      Read the full report:",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/09/10/pandemic-will-speed-bitcoin-adoption-says-dbs-bank-economist,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d6d7ba2319e7e7a6edfe42c504be19c5bbba07f-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
