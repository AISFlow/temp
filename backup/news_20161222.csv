42379122,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mzDl,1482426163,"Bitcoin Prices Shoot Past $870, Setting New High for 2016","Bitcoin prices have surged nearly 10% since crossing the $800 level.  The digital currency's price rose to as much as $874.10 at 10:00 UTC on 22nd December, which represented a 9.3% gain from $800 and a 12.4% increase from the same time one week before, according to the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). Prices have climbed more than 100% since the start of the year.  The move follows a week of steadily rising prices, surpassing $800 on 21st December. Some industry analysts had forecasted that the digital currency would finish 2016 either under $800 or close to that price.  At press time, the average price of bitcoin across markets is $861.78, BPI data reveals.  This week's price action comes after a year of headline-making developments that drove markets. Major moments in 2016 included the UK vote to leave the European Union and the hack of bitcoin exchange Bitfinex.

42379119,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mzBF,1482419419,Ledger Publishes First Volume of Peer-Reviewed Blockchain Research,"The inaugural issue of academic journal Ledger has been published.  The issue includes 10 peer-reviewed papers ranging from probabilistic analysis of the NXT ""forging algorithm"", questions of governance in blockchain and theories of social contracts. The publication was formally launched last year to encourage greater academic involvement in the cryptocurrency industry by giving scholars a platform to publish full-length original research in all areas related to cryptocurrency.  But it took longer than expected to formalize the review process, according to those involved. Now that the publication has released its first volume, the editorial staff expects to release full-publications twice a year and additionals articles throughout.  Christopher Wilmer, co-managing editor and the University of Pittsburgh's principal investigator, told CoinDesk:  ""There is growing interest and activity from researchers at Princeton, Stanford, MIT, Duke, Cornell, and a long list of other universities in doing cryptocurrency research.""  Wilmer said the two main inspirations for the journal were to get academics involved in the cryptocurrency industry and to create a venue free from ""noise"" for researchers (including those who wish to remain pseudonymous) to share their work.  Funded by the non-profit cryptocurrency policy group Coin Center, the journal is published by the University Library System.  The publication accepts submissions in four categories, including research articles that must be no longer than 4,000 words and reviews aggregating relevant research that can be no longer than 6,000 words.  Prior to the publication of an article, journal staff embed a hash of the final manuscript within the bitcoin blockchain, and encourages authors to sign this hash with their own public key.  Beyond academia  Those backing the effort say the journal isn't just aimed at a more diverse audience, but is dedicated in part to sourcing material from researchers outside of academia.  In addition to contributions from more traditional research facilities such as Dublin City University and the Institute of Mathematics at the University of Campesina in Brazil, articles from the Monera Research Lab and a paper about video game payment channels by a medical doctor were also included.  Ledger editor and Zcash advisor Andrew Miller said the process to apply is open to any member of the public with new research to commit, regardless of their particular field of study.  ""Hopefully this helps start discussions in the community too. We're trying to bring the benefits of the peer review process to a broader audience and set of participants,"" he told CoinDesk.  Editorial oversight  In order to help ensure the white papers include actual academic research and don't merely serve to promote a company’s business model, the publication has gathered a group of industry insiders to serve as both board members and editors.  The international editorial board includes Professor Christopher Douglas of Oxford University, Professor Elaine Shi of Cornell University, Dr. Michael Kumhof of the Bank of England, and ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin, among others.  Co-managing editors are Wilmer and bitcoin researcher Peter Rizun. Editors include Miller and Dr Primavera De Filippi of the Harvard Law School.  Coin Center executive director Jerry Brito told CoinDesk:  ""The most important thing to me is that Ledger is a multidisciplinary journal, which will bring together scholarly thinking from various fields — from cryptography to computer science to law.""

42379114,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mz3h,1482417952,"Wells Fargo, ICAP Lead $18 Million Series A for Blockchain Startup Axoni","New York-based blockchain startup Axoni has raised $18m in a new funding.  The Series A round was led by Wells Fargo and Euclid Opportunities, a fintech investment firm owned by financial services company ICAP. Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Thomson Reuters, Andreessen Horowitz, Digital Currency Group, FinTech Collective and F-Prime Capital Partners also took part in the round.  Axoni is one of a number of startups in the blockchain and distributed ledger space seeking to provide services to major financial firms. In the past few months, the startup has tested smart contract and data management applications – work that the funding round indicates will continue. Many of the firms backing the startup – which said it has raised more than $20m to date – have also pursued use cases of their own.  “We are delighted to support Axoni in the next phase of their development,” C. Thomas Richardson, who leads Wells Fargo Securities’ Market Structure and Electronic Trading Services unit, said in a statement.  The round is the latest development in a flurry of venture activity in the space in recent weeks.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Axoni.

42379125,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mzHX,1482411512,What 2016 Taught Us About Smart Contracts,"Jeffrey Billingham is a vice president in Markit’s Processing division, and also leads the company's Chain Gang, focusing on blockchain product development, FinTech partnerships and industry collaboration involving blockchain, smart contracts and distributed ledger technology. He joined Markit in 2013 after three years at UBS, where he focused on managing operational risk in derivatives trading.  In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review feature, Billingham recaps a year spent working on smart contract applications, detailing the successes and tribulations his team experienced in that time.  Sure, many are tired of the hype and prolonged implementation timelines, but changing how the industry thinks about money and agreements deserves time to grow and develop. Thus, we’re long all things DLT in the year ahead. But first, a few thoughts on lessons learned in 2016.  Without a doubt, smart contracts have dominated most DLT conversations in financial services.  My firm’s public projects focused on building smart contract networks for OTC markets. Our goal was simple: identify asynchronous contract workflows and perform those workflows synchronously across a network of provisioned peers.  In two proofs-of-concept (PoCs), we commoditized authentication, warehousing and basic event processing for credit default swaps and equity swaps. Our success was driven by close collaboration with industry participants.  Admittedly, the path to completing the PoCs was not as succinct as those few sentences above.  PoC beginnings  We started scoping our smart contract efforts in the summer of 2015, a time when the mantra was, “I blockchain, therefore I smart contract”.  At that point, most enthusiasts were coming to terms with all the shortcomings of bitcoin-esque models (colored coins, “tokenization”, etc). Ethereum, still finding its way, was considered the progressive alternative and logical next step for industry-wide blockchain projects. Self-executing agreement terms seemed appealing (if a tad ominous sounding?) in that they captured the most basic desire in financial services: make banking operations as highly efficient as possible.  Smart contract projects operated under the premise that counterparties simply needed to encode: a) the circumstances under which each party should be paid, b) the information that changes the payment amount, and c) the times at which these payments will be completed. Put it all on a blockchain and problem solved.  This premise wasn’t entirely untrue, and the derivatives world seemed a perfect testing ground given the focus on better managing a), b) and c) via clearing and margining rules.  Lessons learned  But, as is always the case, the devil is in the details. Scoping these proofs-of-concept proved tedious. In hindsight, the scoping exercise alone was valuable because it brought multiple industry participants around one table to collectively realize that smart contracting is hard.  We learned three important things:  Agreements are not assets. It seems obvious today, but the distinction could have been better appreciated earlier on. Atomic asset transfer via a peer-to-peer network, akin to the bitcoin protocol, is a fundamentally different proposition than the distribution of the bespoke work of contract management across market competitors. Our fascination with fast and cheap settlement morphed into a focus on information synchronization and data integrity. All good things, but very different requirements.  We have a workflow problem, not a technology problem. Contracts are not monolithic “products”. Rather, contracts are the result of a number of discrete functions; creating, legalizing, storing, and enforcing agreements are just a few examples of very different business processes that combine to form the notion of a singular contract. Some of these processes are unique to a firm, while others are managed by industry utilities, while others are value-added services provided by third parties. Smart contracts aren’t necessarily a replacement for any of these as much as they are the platform on which these processes can interact in a less costly and more agile environment.  We are building a big tent. Making contracts smart is not achieved with DLT alone. The industry does itself no favors to consider DLT as the singular lynchpin of smart contract success. When we look at DLT as a tool in the toolbox of automation, smart contracts make more sense in terms of business applicability. DLT is all the more compelling when put alongside machine learning, artificial intelligence, and the host of other technologies that allow multiple parties to digest precisely the same information in the same way at the same time.  What we learned helps temper our itch to boil the ocean. Nevertheless, in the spirit of the holidays, the industry should be grateful for the progress it has made – let’s use these lessons to propel us forward.  Ahead to 2017  2017 will see peer-to-peer contract management systems in production. For use cases that were borne out of successful proofs-of-concept, development should move at a healthy clip. New use cases for different asset classes and more bespoke contracts will not be without their unique set of challenges.  The ability for smart contract providers to distinguish the processing elements (ie: smart contract components) of a contract from the bargaining elements (ie: discretionary and human components) of a contract will determine the adoption curve in capital markets.  Beyond smart contracts, we should expect to see renewed interest in the creation of digital assets. Every asset that is committed to paper can exist in a natively digital world. Legal and regulatory ramifications of such a development aside, digital assets can shift the conversation beyond cost savings and into new revenue opportunities and new markets.  Last but certainly not least, we should all keep an eye on “public” blockchain networks.  Bitcoin is still moving value across the world without a hiccup. While bitcoin, ethereum and new networks that develop in the years ahead may not be purpose-built for financial services, the assets and agreements they maintain are new markets and new business opportunities.

42379129,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mzLJ,1482408476,Why Collaboration Will Drive Blockchain's Success in 2017,"Richard Collin leads the software engineering team in Thomson Reuters' Applied Innovation group. He oversees the development and delivery of potential products that use emerging technologies like blockchain, including the BlockOne ID authentication service.  In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review feature, Collin advocates for collaboration among developers, entrepreneurs and other stakeholders in the blockchain space as the industry heads into 2017.  Close collaboration continues to be the absolute necessity for blockchain success.  The closer the collaboration between developers and commercial organizations, the better the results that emerge. And the closer everybody works with consumers, the more likely it is that the result will be something attractive to them.  This technology is young: the tools to interact with it are designed largely for developers. Creating experiences for consumers is hard, and allowing consumers to interact with it directly can be even harder.  An example: every action on public blockchains requires a transaction fee in a cryptocurrency. It is a small fee, but it is greater than zero. That was acceptable when blockchains were used solely for financial transactions, but today’s use cases have expanded to include complex transactions with smart contracts that may have nothing to do with money transfers.  Problem solving  Solving this problem requires technical expertise from the developer community and a clear understanding of user experience which will attract consumers to use the blockchain.  And there is a potential answer – more importantly, it has been shared. Deep in an ethereum GitHub repository lies a solution which could potentially allow service providers to pay for mining costs without affecting the integrity of the transaction.  Consumers will no longer need cryptocurrency to participate, bringing us closer to a user experience which consumers will recognize.  It is this focus on discussion and on sharing which is the key to the future success of this technology.  Developers, of course, already know this. What is really exciting is that the companies that stand to gain the most from the application of this new technology now know it too. They are rethinking the way they work: rather than developing their services in closed, proprietary silos they too are throwing open their doors to developers and other innovators to build the future.  Organizations are hosting conferences, round-tables, panel discussions and hackathons to make the necessary connections and to pool resources together. Companies are forging partnerships with developer communities.  Why collaboration matters  This is the unique genius of blockchain: it encourages collaboration. Companies as well as developers need to contribute their ideas and enabling technologies in order for them both to succeed.  We saw the benefits of this approach for ourselves at Thomson Reuters earlier this year, when we hosted a hackathon with ethereum to test our enabling technology BlockOne ID, which we then put online in beta for further development. It is a service that helps developers to perform diligence on their users – another recognized challenge when consumers directly interact with blockchains – and the results of this approach have been encouraging.  Developers have been very positive: they told us they appreciated a strong brand clearly working to enable them, to help them address a problem close to both of our hearts. They have risen to the challenge and engaged imaginatively with our shared purpose: to make the blockchain work for organizations and their customers.  Solving these problems creates the opportunity to build familiar consumer experiences and bridge the old world of the Web with newer blockchain-enabled services. Look to see this materialize in 2017.  So I would like to end 2016 and begin 2017 with a call to action.  Developers and commercial organizations are working more closely together than ever before to realize the potential of blockchain technology. I have seen the potential at first hand, as have my colleagues at Thomson Reuters – so please let’s share our ideas face-to-face.  Simply put – let’s keep this conversation going!
