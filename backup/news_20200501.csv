42383594,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9xW0R,1588373696,"Bitfinex, Tether Seek Subpoenas Across US in Hunt for Missing $800M","The Bitfinex crypto exchange is making a new push to find and potentially recover more than $800 million in user funds seized by legal authorities in four different countries after its payment processor’s bank accounts were frozen.      iFinex Inc., Bitfinex's parent firm, applied for subpoenas in Colorado, Arizona and Georgia this month, asking federal courts to aid it in deposing banks that may have held funds for Crypto Capital, the payment processor on which Bitfinex stored customers’ and exchange funds.      An entity hoping to confirm bank records can apply for a subpoena as banks cannot usually share those documents without a court order.      iFinex applied for a subpoena Tuesday to depose SunTrust Bank employees in Georgia. This follows a similar subpoena application to depose the Bank of Colorado earlier in April and ABT & Trust in Arizona. Bitfinex is looking for evidence to support its legal claims to about $880 million held in bank accounts in Poland, Lisbon, London and elsewhere that have been seized by authorities pursuing anti-money laundering criminal charges against Crypto Capital.      Bitfinex’s application follows an initial subpoena request from October 2019, filed in California, where the exchange sought testimony from a former TCA Bancorp executive about Crypto Capital’s accounts. This subpoena was later granted. A federal judge likewise granted iFinex's application in Arizona, while a magistrate judge in Georgia asked the company to file a corporate disclosure statement first.      “Crypto Capital used a bank account with Citibank, N.A. (‘Citibank’) to accept certain deposits from Applicant’s customers. The account was held in the name of ‘Global Trading Solutions, LLC,’” the filing in Arizona stated.      See Also: Bitfinex Covered $850 Million Loss Using Tether Funds, NY Prosecutors Allege      Bitfinex General Counsel Stuart Hoegner told CoinDesk the filings “are aimed squarely at obtaining further information” about the funds held by Crypto Capital.      “As we have said before, Bitfinex is the victim of a fraud and is asserting its rights to funds taken by Crypto Capital through legal measures initiated in various countries,” he said through a spokesperson.    Yearlong search    Bitfinex and its sister firm, stablecoin operator Tether, are the subject of civil lawsuits and an investigation by the New York Attorney General's office alleging fraud and market manipulation.      Tether has denied the allegations in public statements. It has also aggressively issued more tether (USDT) since the investigation began; about $80 million in new USDT virtual currency on Thursday alone. This raises the presumed market value of the currency to about $8 billion, an increase of about $2 billion over the last 40 days, according to the Whale Alert tracking service.      “When you’re looking at big tether issuances like that, you should look at how other currencies are acting in the market,” said Bennett Tomlin, a bitcoin writer and researcher who has been following the case closely. “The other stablecoins don’t seem to have the same kind of inflows. And you will very rarely see tether redemptions. It almost always goes up. Because we know from their lawyers that it’s not fully backed, I’m generally skeptical of larger issuances of tether.”      Bitfinex began to rely on Crypto Capital as other banking relationships deteriorated, the firm said in the Georgia filing. Banks have grown wary of facilitating trade in cryptocurrency for fear of running afoul of cross-border money laundering laws.      However, the president of Crypto Capital, Ivan Manuel Molina Lee, was arrested by Polish authorities in October and charged with being a member of an international gang laundering up to 1.5 billion złoty or about $390 million “from illegal sources.” Authorities wrote that Molina Lee’s crimes included “laundering dirty money for Columbian drug cartels using a cryptocurrency exchange.”      Federal prosecutors indicted a second principal of Crypto Capital, Oz Yosef, in October on charges of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, bank fraud and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. Oz Yosef’s sister, Ravid, was also indicted on fraud charges connected to Crypto Capital but remains at large in Israel.      See Also: Law Firm Representing Quadriga’s Ex-Users Want Info About ‘Shadow Bank’ Crypto Capital      Crypto Capital managed to stash Bitfinex reserves in banks across the world, according to Bitfinex’s application. “Crypto Capital subsequently transferred funds between and among various banks, including in Europe and the United States. In the U.S. alone, Applicant has information that Crypto Capital used accounts held not only at SunTrust, but also Bank of America, Bank of Colorado, Citibank, Enterprise Bank & Trust, HSBC, Stearns Bank, Wells Fargo, TD Bank, and US Bank,” Bitfinex said in its subpoena application.    Connecting the dots    Bitfinex hopes to trace how Crypto Capital moved money from one bank account to another to bolster its ownership claims over funds once held by the processor, according to the filings. Doing so requires navigating the convoluted chain of account ownership, commingled funds and financial transfers Crypto Capital used to manage money, Bitfinex notes in the application.      Polish banks held about $335 million in Bitfinex fiat currency reserves, while Portuguese banks held about another $218 million, according to the Georgia filing.      Referring to statements made by Giancarlo Devasini, Bitfinex’s chief financial officer, the subpoena application said, “[F]rom approximately April to June 2018, Crypto Capital used a bank account ending in -9503 with Citibank to accept deposits from Applicant’s customers. The account was held in the name of Global Trading Solutions, LLC. Because the name of this LLC was similar to that of the entity that then owned Crypto Capital (Global Trade Solutions AG), Applicant believed the LLC to be an entity related to Crypto Capital.”      Global Trading Solutions LLC is owned by Reggie Fowler, a former National Football League investor tied to Crypto Capital. Fowler was indicted one year ago on charges of bank fraud and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business.      He rejected a plea deal earlier this year; a trial scheduled to begin Tuesday has been pushed to Jan. 11, 2021. A Department of Justice spokesperson said he did not know if the delay is related to the COVID-19 pandemic disrupting judicial schedules.      Citibank in California told Bitfinex’s legal team Fowler opened a separate, personal Citibank banking account at the same time and funded it with a $200,000 deposit from an unknown source and two subsequent wire transfers totaling $4 million. The wire transfers came from Banco BPI, one of three Portuguese banks Crypto Capital used for Bitfinex accounts.      While Crypto Capital was taking transfers from Bitfinex into one Citibank account, Fowler transferred $380,000 from his account to a SunTrust account, according to the subpoena application.      See Also: Suit Alleging Tether and Bitfinex Manipulated Bitcoin Market Has Been Revised      Later, nearly $2 million of iFinex customer funds were transferred from the Citibank account to a Bank of Colorado account, Bitfinex said in the Colorado court filing.      Citibank told Bitfinex that this Bank of Colorado account “is held in the name of Eligibility Criterion, an entity owned or controlled by Fowler. Moreover, the wire transfer instructions indicated these transfers were ‘Intercompany Transfers.’” according to the document.      New York courts have enjoined the firms from further depleting their cash reserves and from transferring any of those cash reserves to company executives, and directed the firms’ executives to produce documents and information central to the attorney general’s investigation. The companies are fighting those disclosures in court, an act that the Attorney General’s office described as “deeply perverse.”      Nikhilesh De contributed reporting.",NEUTRAL,USDT,EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | USDT,George Chidi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/05/01/bitfinex-tether-seek-subpoenas-across-us-in-hunt-for-missing-800m,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/31e68b346b2434030f8b49e0ca19564818d7e489-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383602,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9xW4D,1588368080,Bitcoin Miners Usually Create 6 Blocks per Hour. They Just Banged Out 16,"In an unusual deviation from the norm, bitcoin miners just produced 16 blocks in 63 minutes, according to the Blockstream bitcoin block explorer. Four of the new blocks were reported within 46 seconds at 19:02 UTC on Friday.      Each new bitcoin block is produced every 10 minutes, on average. The exact time required to produce a new block can vary significantly and depends in part on the current mining difficulty level, which adjusts every 2,016 blocks, or approximately once every two weeks.      Bitcoin’s anomalous spree of new blocks was first noticed by Étienne Larrivée, bitcoin developer at Satoshi Portal, a Canadian bitcoin financial services company. “Four blocks in less than a minute doesn’t feel natural, but it’s most likely only variance,” Larrivée told CoinDesk.      Such rapid block production could signal bitcoin’s current difficulty level is too low, meaning mining new blocks is too easy. Or it could be a simple coincidence, the product of block time variability.      Read more: Bitcoin Halving, Explained      The event coincides with a six-month high in the aggregate size of unconfirmed transactions in bitcoin’s mempool. Bitcoin transactions are sent to the mempool, which serves as a sort of holding depot, after they have been verified by other non-mining nodes in the network. Miners then take transactions from the mempool and insert them into new blocks, which are then added to the Bitcoin blockchain.      Bitcoin’s mempool soared to 77.58 million bytes worth of unconfirmed transactions on Thursday, according to Blockchain.com.      The high number of unconfirmed transactions coinciding with such rapid block production is curious given that the job of bitcoin miners is to insert unconfirmed transactions in new blocks.      With bitcoin’s third halving less than two weeks away, Friday’s spree of new blocks could signal a significant upcoming mining difficult adjustment amidst a surge in mining power.

42383604,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9xW7z,1588366506,Blockfolio Quietly Patches Years-Old Security Hole That Exposed Source Code,"A ""white hat,"" or ethical, hacker found a gaping hole in Blockfolio, the popular mobile cryptocurrency portfolio tracking and management app. The security vulnerability, which appeared in older versions of the application, could have allowed a bad actor to steal closed source code and possibly inject their own code into Blockfolio’s GitHub repository and, from there, into the app itself.      A security researcher at cybersecurity firm Intezer, Paul Litvak, made the discovery last week when he decided to review the security of the cryptocurrency-related tools he was using. Litvak has been involved in cryptocurrencies since 2017 when he used to build bots for trading, and Blockfolio is an Android app he used for managing his portfolio.      “After some time reviewing their [new] app to no avail, I took a look at older versions of the app to see if I could find any long-forgotten secret or hidden web endpoints,” said Litvak. “Soon I found this version from 2017 accessing GitHub’s API.”      This code connects to the company’s Github repository using a set of constants that included a filename and, most importantly, the key Github uses to allow access to repositories. It appears below as the variable “d.”      The app queried Blockfolio’s private GitHub repositories, and that function quite simply downloaded Blockfolio’s frequently asked questions directly from GitHub, saving the company from the effort of having to update it inside its apps.      But the key is dangerous in that it could access and control an entire GitHub repository. Since the app was three years old, Litvak was curious as to whether it was still a threat.      “This is severe, but I thought maybe it’s just some old token not in use anymore, from back when they launched,” said Litvak.      The key, he discovered, was still active.      “And I found that, nope, the token’s still active and has a “repo” OAuth Scope,” he said. An “OAuth Scope” is used to limit an application's access to a user's account.      A “repo,” according to GitHub, grants full access to private and public repositories, and includes read/write access to code, commit statuses and organization projects, among other functions.      Read more: Public Opinion Shifts on Big Tech and Privacy During Pandemic      “It was using private credentials to access its private code repository,” said Litvak. “Anyone who was curious enough to reverse-engineer the old Blockfolio app could've reproduced it and downloaded all of Blockfolio's code and even pushed their own malicious code into their code base. You're not supposed to have private credentials in apps that anyone can download.”      The vulnerability had been public for two years and the hole was still open. Litvak alerted Blockfolio to the issue via social media, given Blockfolio does not have a bug bounty program to root out vulnerabilities.      Blockfolio Co-Founder & CEO Edward Moncada confirmed in an email to CoinDesk that a GitHub access token was mistakenly left in a previous version of the Blockfolio app codebase, and when alerted to the vulnerability, Blockfolio revoked access to the key.      Over the next several days Moncada said Blockfolio did an audit of its systems and confirmed that no changes were made. Given the token provided access to code that was separate from the database where user data is stored, user data was not at risk.      The token would allow someone to change source code, but through its internal processes for releasing changes to the system Moncada said there was never a risk malicious code would have been released to users.      “I'd say worst-case scenario, an attacker would update the app's code and collect data about the users. They also have the feature where you put exchange API keys in the app so that could be stolen as well,"" said Litvak. ""But they [Blockfolio] claim that's impossible because of their 'security reviews.'

Bitcoin (BTC) was trading up 1.2% over 24 hours at $8,728, with 10-day and 50-day technical indicator moving averages continuing to signal sideways sentiment Friday. A slight price rally to $9,000 took place at around 12:00 UTC (9 a.m. EDT), though it later pulled back to $8,700 territory at press time.      The first trading day in May saw Japan’s Nikkei 225 index closing in the red 2.8%. Exports from South Korea dropped 24% in the first quarter, a tough blow for a region that relies on them. European markets were closed for a holiday Friday.      The S&P 500 index was down 2.8% Friday as dismal manufacturing and real estate data dragged on markets. Earnings for major companies in the tech sector were disappointing, taking a toll on the U.S. equity benchmark. More than ever before, the S&P 500 index is influenced by just a handful of tech stocks, with five companies now constituting more than 20% of its composition.       However, the traditional futures market has captivated those experienced traders looking to bet on the future price of bitcoin.      “What's demanding our mind space is that, whereas on BitMEX we've seen a fall in open interest, we've seen it stabilize on the CME and Bakkt amid higher volume the last two days,” said Vishal Shah, a crypto options traders and founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5.      Read more:Bitcoin Rises Back to $8.8K Even as US Stock Futures Drop      ”That's a silver lining around positioning,” he added. Indeed, open interest, or contracts outstanding, on crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX has trended lower.      Open interest on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) bitcoin futures market is up along with higher volume. The CME is a stalwart for futures trading, including bitcoin, for well-capitalized, experienced commodities traders. Brokerages usually require a $250,000 minimum deposit to maintain an active account there.      Some uncertainty ahead of bitcoin’s expected May 12 halving event might have professional traders more focused on futures rather than the spot market, according to Sweden-based over-the-counter crypto trader Henrik Kugelberg.      Read more:Bitcoin Whale Addresses Hit Highest Number Since August 2019      “Bitcoin tends to move in the opposite direction of what the broad layers expect, so the days around the halving might turn into a bloodbath,” Kugelberg said. “I have a distinct feeling a whale or two will suck the satoshis out of people wanting to catch the halving run,” he added.      Regardless of the trading venue, there are investment strategies aplenty ahead of bitcoin’s reward halving from 12.5 down to 6.25 BTC. “The arbitrage opportunities will be very vibrant,” said Constantin Kogan, partner at cryptocurrency fund BitBull Capital.

At the end of Q1 2020, gold markets faced a “historic squeeze.” Demand for the yellow metal grew acutely due to economic uncertainty while trading routes and refineries were cut off and shut down.      To ease the shortages, Australia’s largest gold refinery has significantly increased production. It has even been flying gold bars to New York because retail demand for gold is reportedly stronger with Western buyers. In Switzerland, three of the world’s largest gold refineries are partially re-opening after strict lockdown measures forced them to close.      Read more: Looking for a Safe Haven Digital Asset? Try Gold      For digital assets markets, the situation has coincided with a growing interest in trading gold-backed tokens.      Tether Gold, the leading gold-back token measured by volume, launched in late January 2020. During Q1 2020, hourly trading volume for its new token bounced between a few hundred dollars and over $1 million.      On Thursday, hourly trading volume in Tether Gold climbed to over $13 million, up from roughly $1 million the day before, according to CoinGecko.      Tether CTO Paolo Ardoino told CoinDesk there is significant interest from hedge funds and professional traders in using Tether Gold to diversify their portfolio with gold, calling the yellow metal an asset that is “considered in a growth trajectory for the next period.”      The token’s hourly trading volume fell to around $2 million on Friday.

This episode is sponsored by ErisX, The Stellar Development Foundation and Grayscale Digital Large Cap Investment Fundhttps://grayscale.co/coindesk    Two of CoinDesk’s most popular series, NLW’s The Breakdown podcast and the Money Reimagined newsletter by Chief Content Officer Michael Casey, come together for a special podcast microseries in the run up to Consensus: Distributed, our first virtual big-tent event May 11-15.      The Breakdown: Money Reimagined builds on themes Casey explores in his newsletter to tell the story of key arenas in the battle for the future of money – from the incumbent dollar to the aspirational DCEP to the insurgent bitcoin – in the context of a post-COVID-19 world. The four-part podcast features over a dozen voices including Consensus: Distributed speakers Caitlin Long, Matthew Graham and more.

Even before COVID-19, 2020 was poised to be a big year in the battle for the future of money after 2019 featured Federal Reserve intervention in overnight lending markets; the launch of libra, backed by Facebook; an acceleration of China’s central bank digital currency; growing acceptance of bitcoin as ""digital gold,"" and more.      When coronavirus hit, however, it fundamentally altered the context in which this battle for the future of money would take place.      In late January, China issued a lockdown for the city of Wuhan in Hubei Province. Over the next few weeks, that lockdown has extended to more than 200 million people. China-based blockchain investor Matthew Graham called living through it “the craziest thing I’d ever seen.”      Yet, despite such a chaotic blow to the economy of the supply chain capital of the world, U.S. stock markets continued to mint new highs, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average reaching an all time high on Feb. 12 and the S&P 500 following suit exactly one week later.      On Monday, Feb. 24, the dam started to break. Caitlin Long, founder of the crypto bank Avanti and 22-year Wall Street veteran, said COVID-19 was “starting to overwhelm the ability of central banks to solve this. … You can’t solve a pandemic with liquidity. It’s just not going to work.”      That week would get messier still. By the end of the week, which completed a 10% drop from just 10 days earlier, crypto trader Scott Melker said, “This is a historic drop. This is something we haven’t seen since World War II.”      By the first week in March, the Fed sprang into action, calling an emergency weekend meeting to announce a 50 basis point rate cut. Unfortunately, the market did the opposite of what the Fed might have hoped. Delphi Digital macro analyst Kevin Kelly put it this way: “What last week’s rate cut did was confirm to equity investors what they didn’t want to admit to themselves: that this was a real risk and something the Federal Reserve was watching as a real threat to economic activity.”      See also: Money Reimagined: COVID-19’s Lessons in Innovation      As true fear crept into markets, the stage was now set for a torrent of action and intervention.      In this first episode of Money Reimagined, we look at:    Why U.S. markets took so long to react  How the stock market became a political utility  Why, even before the crisis, “increasingly exotic forms of quantitative easing” were inevitable  Why the bailouts have some investors accusing our entire market of being cronyism rather than capitalism  What unlimited money printing means for the U.S. dollar.    The key question explored in this episode is what happens to the U.S. dollar next? On the one hand, monetary stimulus like the world has never seen suggests that at some point, we should anticipate an inflationary environment. On the other, the dollar has done nothing but grow stronger compared to other currencies. How can both of these things be true simultaneously?      For that, we turn to insights from Matthew Graham, Caitlin Long, Scott Melker, Kevin Kelly, Ben Hunt, Luke Gromen, Travis Kling, Mark Yusko, Anthony Pompliano, Jared Dillian, Dave Portnoy, Michael Casey, Preston Pysh and Peter Zeihan.

42383584,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9xVst,1588355210,What We Can Learn From Telegram's Token Troubles,"Sandro Gorduladze is a partner at HASH CIB, a financial services firm specializing in digital assets. The opinions expressed here belong solely to the author.      Telegram runs the world’s largest independent messenger not controlled by a tech giant like Tencent or Facebook, both distrusted by users on privacy grounds. Populations of large countries such as Iran and Russia rely on it for uncensored communication. Civic activists from Hong Kong to Catalonia coordinate massive protests with Telegram. And, the global crypto community makes a modest contribution to its 400 million active users. In other words, this company and its future is important for the free world.      Yet, this future is in jeopardy. Telegram fought off pressures from nation states and behemoth competitors to support its users’ freedom but lost a legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission this March. It was a preliminary court decision – but there’s much at stake.      See also: Telegram Caves to US Regulators: Delays Blockchain Launch, Offers to Return $1.2B to Investors      Some backstory: In early 2018, Telegram, seeking financing, conducted a private sale of its yet-to-be-created cryptocurrency in exchange for $1.7 billion from Silicon Valley’s top venture funds, big private investors and a few then-lucky others to fill the gap between those groups.    The future    The company’s fate is now to be decided by those stakeholders. After April 30, they can exercise their contractual right for a refund. Should this happen, the company would be drained of the money it needs not only to continue the legal dispute with the SEC, but maintain the infrastructure and development of its messenger (yearly burn rate is estimated at $200 million by founder Pavel Durov). Telegram would have to return investors around $1.2 billion they expected to have left from the fundraiser by now.      This week, the company offered investors a proposal to extend the deadline for another year (in addition to the six months investors gave it back in October 2019 when the dispute erupted). Telegram wants to use this year to resolve its legal troubles and launch the blockchain. In return, it offered investors a token on the original terms or in the form of ""another cryptocurrency."" As a fallback option, Telegram promises 10% on top of the full investment amount (instead of just 72 cents on the dollar refunded now) to be paid from selling the stake in the company to a party external to the discussed transaction. So the company expects to spend $1.87 billion (excluding the runway and legal costs it will incur in the process) it doesn’t yet have if it loses its own bet to resolve legal troubles with the SEC in one year.    Telegram hopes to turn almost free capital from 2018 into cheap capital in 2020, while risking to it becoming very expensive come 2021.    Investors are offered a choice: to get back their 72 cents on a dollar now versus receiving some cryptocurrency, or a dollar and 10 cents in a year from now. Their opportunity cost is uncertain given the economic crisis we’re currently in. But some would argue it’s pretty high. Telegram hopes to turn almost free capital from 2018 into cheap capital in 2020, while risking to it becoming very expensive come 2021.      Top litigators point out the preliminary injunction against Telegram granted to the SEC in March is ambiguous. Some also insist the future of compliant token fundraising and overall crypto innovation is also jeopardized here. Other legal experts believe the order to halt TON could be overthrown on appeal, or if the case ever reaches actual trial. Yet, some non-legal experts argue that, from a business standpoint, justice has been served. For now, though, what matters is what Telegram’s investors think.    The past    As a company (HASH CIB) counting some of the larger (non-U.S.) investors in TON (the Telegram Open Network) among our clients, we closely followed the project from its inception. My research team has produced lengthy coverage reports on TON, investor notes and updates.      See also: Josh Lawler - Telegram Ruling Closes Another Door to Legally Compliant Token Sales    Our readership, unfortunately restricted only to industry professionals and accredited investors, know we’ve long calledhttps://hashcib.com/research/a_TON_of_Grams.pdf their attention to the project’s execution risks, including issues related to U.S. securities laws. But in all honesty, we did not expect these issues to materialize the way they did.    Telegram used the late peak of the 2017 initial coin offering wave to finance its messenger for years ahead, without having to give up control of the company. Getting a shot at creating a public blockchain to compete with Bitcoin and Ethereum was a secondary goal, yet very attainable. Building a blockchain didn’t seem that difficult given the open source nature of the industry, and the network effects were all on Telegram’s side. No public blockchain came even relatively close in the size of Telegram’s user base, while being able to reach market capitalizations of tens of billions of dollars at the same time.       See also: Preston Byrne - With Kik and Telegram Cases, the SEC Tries to Kill the SAFT      Given the team’s track record in shipping great products and its ever-expanding user base, investors down-weighted issues related to complexity of their technological goals and inexperience with blockchains. At the time Telegram was aiming at high-calibre venture funds and family offices, turning down specialist crypto investors. Had some of those investors been given allocations, Telegram might have received more support from top crypto insiders, who are often consulted by U.S. regulators.       Telegram’s troubles started not really with the manner in which it sold its future tokens. Most of the projects at the time used similar rhetoric and tactics, including large ones, later let off the hook by the SEC or investors.       What mainly prompted TON’s problems was that Telegram was too ambitious in its technological aspirations and didn’t care to harness a developer and user community around their ambitions. Legal concerns could explain why the company did very little to engage with future users of its cryptocurrency (and this could be addressed after launch, given the messenger’s popularity). But its in-transparency didn’t help. The team stuck to an internal team of “star programmers,” first-time blockchain devs and leveraged little external help and subsequent open-source peer-reviewing and testing – an uncommon practice for such a massive endeavor. That cost them development time before the SEC got involved.     Telegram was too ambitious in its technological aspirations and didn’t care to harness a developer and user community around their ambitions.    Telegram hasn’t engaged much with its own investors either. Investors were continuously unclear as to when TON would launch or what services it would eventually provide. The company seemed to believe that users, developers and investors would continue supporting it regardless. Maybe that explains why investors didn’t come out after the March court decision to help the company turn things around and negotiate restructuring prior to the April 30 deadline. Will they be willing to take the equity offer if Telegram doesn’t find a suitable buyer a year from now?    The present    With all that in mind, going back to the recent offer Telegram made to its investors, the following questions arise:       Would the company be able now to retain funds sufficient to fight the SEC, maintain its ever-growing messenger, continue developing the blockchain and potentially fight additional legal claims from some of its investors? The significant portion of the remaining $1.2 billion would need to be retained to make it happen.       If it indeed does, would it be able to win the litigation in a year’s time and launch TON as initially envisioned, or if it loses, find a buyer for its equity, willing to pay for the aftermath?       What if it doesn’t retain the funds necessary, not even the $200 million to $300 million to both focus just on the messenger and fight off potential other complaints?      Answers to these questions aren’t unknown. There is much corporate history to back them up. I believe investors are finally getting a chance to get a piece of the company come April 2021. And that’s what some of them wanted when participating in its crypto sale: exposure to Telegram’s growth and success. This is less relevant for the crypto industry, though, which I hope stays unaffected. More than that, I also hope the outcome of this doesn’t affect Telegram 400 million loyal users. But of that I am less certain.",NEGATIVE,TON,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TON | TOKEN SALE,Sandro Gorduladze,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/05/01/what-we-can-learn-from-telegrams-token-troubles,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d05f4036333f8e9a44c3a278f4d28b231a080a44-1200x795.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383608,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9xWBl,1588352884,Blockchain Bites: Bitcoin Whales and American Buyers May Be Driving This Rally,"Bitcoin was up over 20% year to date Thursday morning.      Data suggests that the recent price rise is being driven by U.S. investors buying bitcoin on spot and derivatives exchanges. Meanwhile, there are now more ""whales"" swimming in this global sea than since mid-2019. And bitcoin custodial startups are reporting an uptick in users.      You're reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they're significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk's newsletters here.      It's suspected much of this activity is driven by the impending halving event, which for some sober minds, is nothing more than an act of arithmetic. Here's the story:    Top Shelf    American Buyers Data indicates American buyers are fueling bitcoin’s rally. On U.S. exchanges, spot premiums are showing stronger buy-side pressure relative to other markets. Further, exchanges licensed to offer bitcoin futures to American investors are rallying while their unlicensed competitors are not. Su Zhu, CEO of Three Arrows Capital, said American investors “should give us a strong base given that U.S. tax policy means nobody sells spot for small profits.”      Call Me Ishmael, Is That A Whale? The number of Bitcoin addresses holding more than 10,000 coins rose to the highest level since mid-2019. These 111 so-called whales contribute to the bullish narrative surrounding the top crypto by marketcap. “Some of these addresses may belong to high-net-worth individuals or groups, who are diversifying into bitcoin amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and ahead of the mining reward halving,” said Wayne Chen, CEO of Interlapse Technologies.      Custody During COVID Bitcoin wallet startups are reporting an uptick in users and profits amid the market disruption caused by COVID-19. “An event like that [pandemic] makes people think about how they are storing their bitcoin,"" Will Cole, Unchained’s chief product officer, said.      Parental Help Intercontinental Exchange, the parent company to Bakkt, spent close to $300 million helping the bitcoin warehouse acquire loyalty rewards provider Bridge2 Solutions. Bakkt announced it would acquire Bridge2 in February, while simultaneously raising a $300 million Series B funding round with participation from Microsoft's M12, PayU, Boston Consulting Group, Goldfinch Partners, CMT Digital and Pantera Capital.      Mining Money Argo Blockchain, a bitcoin mining firm listed on the London Stock Exchange, reported an 11-fold increase in revenues from the year before. The company attributed its success to cutting off its consumer-facing arm and focusing on mining some 1,330 bitcoin last year.

Despite the enthusiasm leading into Bitcoin’s third halving event, expected in less than two weeks, on a technical level nothing really changes.

Following a rise of 23% over the last two days, though, Bitcoin’s rally looks overstretched and the gains may be short-lived.  Tezos, one of the fastest-growing “staking tokens,” jumped 83% in April, the most among cryptocurrencies with a market value of at least $1 billion, based on data from Messari. These gains outpace bitcoin’s 37% jump, as well as Tezos rival ethereum.

42383607,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9xWAV,1588351915,Money Reimagined: COVID-19's Lessons in Innovation,"Know your enemy.      Epidemiologists and drugmakers are now living out that maxim as they frantically study the pathology of a virus President Trump calls the “hiddenenemy.”      But learning about COVID-19 shouldn’t solely be about building a medical weapon against it. We can also take lessons from it as a society. Contemplating the virus’ “success” can help us design a more resilient economy and prepare for the dynamic digital financial system of the future.      Before you write this off as the ramblings of a madman, note that biomimicry, or biomimetics – the study and imitation of nature to find solutions to complex human problems – enjoys a long and respected tradition. And, as per this Biomimicry Institute article, COVID-19 is a great entry point into the field.      You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.      There’s a reason we habitually use words like “ecosystem” to describe economic systems. As with natural ecosystems, the complexity of an economy’s relationships creates relentless, unpredictable change. Yet, to thrive societies need stability – just as nature needs homeostasis. So, an economy’s success depends on its ability to adapt within that dynamic environment.       In living systems, the key to homeostasis over time is evolution. The survivors of a disruptive change will be those members of a species with mutations that resist the threat. Those traits are then passed on through reproduction. Similarly, economies adapt to disruption and change by evolving – in essence, by innovating, and adopting new models. Those with the best foundational structure to innovate/evolve will thrive over time.      This is where viruses are especially telling as biomimetic subjects. With a singular purpose to exploit the cells of living beings to replicate themselves, viruses are in a constant state of mutation. It’s part of their ongoing evolutionary struggle against our immune systems, which are themselves constantly adapting, using antigens installed by viruses to produce antibodies that repel them. Sometimes in this randomized, hit-or-miss process, the virus gets the upper hand. COVID-19 is one such winner.      See also: Why the Dollar Has Never Been Stronger or More Set Up to Fail    An evolved powerhouse    The COVID-19 mutation is so powerful because it’s focused on the social aspects of our existence. Two traits in particular have enabled it both to overcome millions of people’s immune systems and to disarm our most valuable disease-fighting weapon: our collective brain power.       The first is COVID-19’s highly contagious nature. The virus’ R0 – a measure of how many new infections stem from each case – was calculated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at a median level of 5.7 at the height of the Wuhan outbreak. It’s aided by a pre-symptom incubation period averaging six days, with victims typically becoming contagious at some point before then. Up to 50% of all cases may be asymptomatic, which fosters a high propensity for transmission by oblivious carriers.       The second trait is more insidious: an inconsistency of outcomes that muddles our capacity to agree on how to respond. As New York City’s experience shows us, COVID-19’s estimated morbidity rate of 3%-7% of cases is high enough to overwhelm hospitals during outbreaks. Yet, for the vast majority of otherwise contagious patients, it’s virtually harmless, encouraging complacency toward social distancing and, in some places, outright “lockdown rebellion.”       If COVID-19 were like the current-season flu, with a death rate of around 1%, our health system could have managed the patient load without quarantines and we could more safely have started the clinical trials needed to develop a vaccine. Conversely, if it were as brutal as, say, the 2014-2016 West African Ebola outbreak, in which 40% of victims died, there would have been overwhelming support early on for a total lockdown.       Both a vaccine or total lockdown would have stopped the virus in its tracks, frustrating its replication ambitions. But COVID-19 allowed neither. In occupying the middle ground between harmless and lethal, it outwitted our collective decision-making systems. It’s as if COVID-19 ran a highly effective disinformation campaign.     Lessons in innovation    What can we learn from this remarkable phenomenon? What conditions do our economic and social systems need to adapt to such threats? How do we redirect factories and supply chains toward needed production and keep incomes flowing during times like this? How do we optimize our economy’s adaptive, innovative potential?       When venture capitalist Marc Andreessen laments our incapacity to “build"" or journalist Jon Stokes observes that our economy is built for just-in-time efficiency but not for resilience, they’re describing an economic model that’s not optimized for innovation. We must strive for Nassem Taleb’s ideal of an “antifragile” system, a quick-action economic immune system with agility, backups, alternative paths to delivery and capacity to rapidly pivot. It requires a framework conducive to rapid-response innovation, to the societal equivalent of virus-like evolution.       Such a system must be open. It must allow the greatest variety of ideas a voice and a clear pathway to potential deployment. To continue with the metaphor of evolution, we’re looking for the widest possible gene pool, a big primordial soup from which the new life of innovation can spring. The answer lies in an open, decentralized, permissionless system.     Towards permissionlessness    To understand the power of “permissionlessness,” look to the history of the internet. Applications built on open-access protocols such as TCP/IP for data-switching, HTTP for websites and SMTP for email proved overwhelmingly more popular and successful among both developers and users than closed online systems such as France’s Minitel and AOL. In the race to survive and thrive, the permissionless internet, which now boasts more than three billion users and more than a billion websites, easily out-evolved the corporate- and state-permissioned environments of those “Intranets.”       The permissionless ideal was tarnished in the post-millennial Web 2.0 era, as Google, Amazon, Facebook and other powerful gatekeepers took control of the internet’s data, the digital age’s most important commodity. Hope now lies in a Web 3.0 phase founded on decentralized protocols inspired by cryptocurrency and blockchain models. These offer a vision in which no one needs permission from any one entity to exchange money, data or any other form of digital value.       Yet, here, too, tension persists between permissionless and permissioned models. The latter is more easily scalable at this early development stage and companies and governments are reluctant to cede control. (For the sake of simple illustration, we can say decentralized blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum are permissionless while Walmart’s distributed ledger supply chain system is permissioned.)     Humanity's interest    Now more than ever, as the COVID-19 crisis accelerates the arrival of digital, programmable currency and open blockchain solutions, the economic advantages of permissionless systems deserve a sound hearing.       So far, China’s Blockchain Service Network (BSN) and Digital Currency Electronic Payments (DCEP) system seem miles ahead of the rest of the world. But while the BSN’s designers wisely allowed for interoperability with permissonless blockchains and assets, the system’s ultimate gatekeeper will always be the Chinese Communist Party.       Here lies the West’s Internet 1.0-like opportunity to out-evolve China. In the 1990s, the United States actively promoted an open internet. Western allies now have a similar opportunity. They can create a regulatory environment that fosters permissionless standards for exchanging digital money and data, allowing developers to integrate useful applications into an open, digital financial system.       Yet, the ultimate goal is not to beat China per se.      The pandemic has revealed the shared dangers we face in the absence of a robust, adaptable economic and social system for dealing with such threats. Supporting the evolutionary power of a permissionless system is in all of humanity’s interest.    Springtime in here    Unless you’re spending quarantine under a rock, you would know bitcoin has been on a tear. What you might not know is that this is the fifth consecutive year bitcoin has rallied in April. The repeated trend, which tends to continue into the first half of May, has even spawned a meme: the “Consensus Pump.” That’s a nod to CoinDesk’s annual Consensus event, the most important crypto conference of the year, in the second week of May. (I shouldn’t need to say this but, to be absolutely clear, CoinDesk’s editorial team is in no way “pumping” bitcoin, and we make no investment recommendations.)      It’s possible this pattern is merely a more extreme version of what often happens in the lead-up to summer on Wall Street, where an old stockbroker’s adage tells investors to “Sell in May and Stay Away.” Either way, I cannot deny the confluence of the price run-up and the bitcoin halving is making us even more excited to be putting on Consensus: Distributed, our entirely virtual version of the big event May 11-15. Register here.    Global town hall    A small Italian town has started creating its own banknotes. According to euronews and Associated Press, Enrico Fratangelo, mayor of Castellino del Biferno (population: 550), has been studying the idea for 12 years. But it was Italy’s severe COVID-19 lockdown that pushed him to launch the “Ducati” notes. “We decided to mint money to make sure the local economy could withstand the impact of the situation,” Fratangelo told the AP in an interview. In doing so, he was following a tradition of community currencies such as ""the Brixton Pound,” the “Ithaca Hours,” and the “Patacones” that Buenos Aires Province issued in the midst of Argentina’s crisis. Sometimes, these ideas are founded on “local-first” movements to keep money inside the community; sometimes it’s out of desperation, when cash shortages demand a new medium of exchange. Either way, it’s a concept ripe for a COVID-19-era move toward programmable digital currency, combining a backlash against failed centralized power and desperate needs for liquidity with the power to create money out of software. Already, blockchain ventures like Bancor are building tools for communities to issue digital local currencies.      As talk of digital fiat currency grows, “programmable money” is becoming a buzzword. But what does it actually mean?Antony Lewis, author of the acclaimed “The Basics of Bitcoin and Blockchain,” has made a useful stab at defining the taxonomy. Lewis, who recently left bank-led distributed ledger consortium R3 to join Singapore-owned Temasek, makes the critical point that the mere existence of a computer interface for payment commands is insufficient for money to be “programmable.” What matters is that no third-party computer, such as a bank’s, can interfere with the coded commands from payer to payee. It’s a prerequisite for what he smartly calls “designer money.” To me, what ultimately matters is for the payer and payee to trust an intermediary won’t intervene in their transaction. So I don’t yet agree with Lewis that “programmable” can’t apply to stablecoins that are managed by blockchain-based smart contracts whose logic allows them to block the payment in special cases. By that standard, a central bank digital currency would not be programmable, either. Maybe the jury is still out. It will depend on whether users sufficiently trust the model to use them programmably.      A big deal, folks: China’s Blockchain Services Network has launched. AfterCoinDesk’s David Pan broke important news on the makeup and key players behind the BSN and we published a pro-BSN opinion piece by Fudan University academic Michael Sung, some on Crypto Twitter scoffed. “It’s not a blockchain,” some said. “We already have bitcoin,” others added. For sure, what China is building is a long way from the permissionless, governmentless vision behind bitcoin. And, as I argued above, permissionlessness should ultimately win. But to dismiss this grand project as dead on arrival is dangerously naive. The design, with its use of Hyperledger and Cosmos technology to build an interoperable framework and toolkit for companies and cities to cheaply and easily build and interlock their operations, is quite stunning for its scope. Yes, it could enable a frightening “panopticon” surveillance apparatus – despite privacy promises from BSN architects. But that doesn’t mean it won’t succeed in driving an economic leapfrog. Whether we like it or not, China is leading the way in reimagining money.

42431840,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN6uPh,1588341713,"American Buyers Are Fueling Bitcoin’s Rally, Data Suggests","Bitcoin is now up over 20% in 2020 after rallying to over $9,500 on Thursday. The cryptocurrency’s recovery from March lows ahead of the protocol’s third halving event is primarily fueled by American investors, according to market data.      On U.S.-based exchanges, bitcoin has traded at sustained premiums during the end of March and through April. Spot premiums indicate that an exchange is experiencing stronger buy-side pressure relative to other spot markets, signaling higher demand.      By contrast, after the cycle lows in December 2018, bitcoin spot prices on all dominant exchanges traded closely to the index price.      Bitcoin futures markets also reflect the strong bullish sentiment of American investors.      When bitcoin plunged to $3,867 on March 12, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index, open interest for bitcoin futures markets across the industry plummeted by over 50 percent. Open interest for bitcoin futures on BitMEX, Huobi, and OKEx are still down significantly from their pre-March 12 levels, according to data from Skew.      Neither BitMEX nor Huobi serve U.S. customers. OKEx has only recently allowed U.S.-based traders from a small number of states to use its platform.      Read more: First Mover: Tezos Led Crypto Market With Twice Bitcoin’s Gains in April      Meanwhile, open interest for CME bitcoin futures has more than recovered from its March lows and continues to rally. Although CME open interest is much smaller in relative terms than BitMEX, OKEx or Huobi, these data nonetheless corroborate significantly higher buying interest from U.S.-based investors compared to their non-U.S.-based counterparts. Renaissance Technologies, a market-crushing, U.S.-based asset manager, also recently signalled interest in joining the bitcoin futures market.      Why Americans are scrambling to buy bitcoin is an open question. Bitcoin’s third halving event is less than two weeks away, and Google search data shows record interest in the event. Some buyers might be anticipating significant price inflation after the event.      Bitcoin miners choosing to accumulate long-term spot positions ahead of the halving could also account for the interested buy-side demand. And the number of small bitcoin investors, specifically in the U.S., seems to be quickly growing.      “I also think halving FOMO [“fear of missing out”] and some miner buying activity is a factor, particularly given how good [bitcoin’s] hashrate has looked in the last month,” said Aditya Das, cryptocurrency market analyst at Brave New Coin.      Read more: Bitcoin Whale Addresses Hit Highest Number Since August 2019      Bitcoin’s recent rally is “healthier” than previous upward trends, said Yan Liberman, former associate at Deutsche Bank and co-founder of Delphi Digital, a digital asset research group, in a correspondence with CoinDesk. Since “Black Thursday,” bitcoin has been “supported by strong growth in spot volumes on exchanges like Coinbase, while futures open interest remained relatively flat at $2 billion following the leverage flush during the March selloff,” said Liberman.      By comparison, bitcoin’s rally at the start of 2020 was “buoyed by speculation,” according to Liberman, based on the doubling of open interest in bitcoin futures markets from $2 billion to over $4 billion within two months.      That U.S. buyers are leading bitcoin’s rally from its March lows is a uniquely bullish signal to some traders. Su Zhu, CEO of Three Arrows Capital, told CoinDesk that American investors “should give us a strong base given that U.S. tax policy means nobody sells spot for small profits.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Zack Voell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/01/american-buyers-are-fueling-bitcoins-rally-data-suggests,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bee5d3119b17e7746c3377e5854e6add15ce7785-2560x1706.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431829,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN6u1h,1588338000,Overstock Wants to Trade Traditional Stocks on tZERO Crypto App,"Overstock's tZERO is seeking regulatory approval to trade blockchain-based securities and traditional stocks on its bitcoin exchange app, tZERO Crypto.      Announced during the online retail giant’s Q1 earnings call Thursday, the plan would grant tZERO Crypto’s users access to cryptocurrency, security token and traditional stock trading on a single platform, a regulatory feat none have accomplished yet. Overstock’s security token trading subsidiary is hoping to become the first to break that ground.      tZERO Crypto is tZERO’s noncustodial exchange app supporting bitcoin, ethereum and ravencoin. It is currently separate from tZERO’s digital securities trading platform the tZERO Alternative Trading System (ATS).      The securities tZERO wants to trade are still recorded on a traditional central ledger, but a blockchain platform is used to act as a backup record.      Connecting tZERO Crypto’s fast-growing but relatively meager use base – the app had 6,404 accounts in Q1, a 40 percent increase over the previous quarter – to the tZERO ATS would potentially increase liquidity in a security token market that acutely lacks intraday trading volume.      On Thursday, tZERO ATS’ two listed security tokens, OSTKO and TZROP, changed hands 73 and 4,835 times, respectively, on tZERO’s broker-dealer partner platform Dinosaur Financial. In comparison, Overstock’s OSTK shares traded 10.5 million times on Nasdaq Thursday.      See Also: Vertalo, tZERO Are Bringing $300M in Real Estate to the Tezos Blockchain      tZERO Crypto’s cohesive trading platform would run on a yet-to-be-approved subsidiary broker-dealer, tZERO Markets. The firm's CEO, Saum Noursalehi, had previously targeted the first half of 2020 for tZERO Markets’ launch and repeated Thursday that he expected a verdict in Q2 – “but you can never be sure with regulators.”      “Once we receive regulatory approval, our app will trade cryptocurrencies, security tokens (including TZROP and OSTKO), and traditional stocks,” Noursalehi told CoinDesk. “The value of the crypto app users will grow as we add the capability to trade securities on it.""    Driving security token growth    Linking tZERO Crypto to tZERO ATS is one of many user acquisition strategies.      Previous growth gambits appear to be working. That includes Overstock’s flashiest: the upcoming digital security shareholder dividend, a plan – designed by former CEO Patrick Byrne – to plug thousands of Overstock shareholders into the tZERO ATS by wooing them onto Dinosaur Financial with a company security token, OSTKO.      See Also: Patrick Byrne, Cryptocurrency Champion, Resigns as Overstock CEO      Noursalehi told CoinDesk that “Dino has seen a notable increase in investor onboarding” ahead of the May 19 dividend payday, though he declined to state how many had signed up. Dino is the only broker-dealer approved to run tZERO ATS out of the six broker-dealers subscribed.      The digital dividend has prompted new broker-dealers to approach tZERO ATS, Noursalehi said. He said tZERO is in talks with about 100 broker-dealers.      tZERO is betting that it can bring more investors onto its ATS by giving them more digital securities to trade. Only two tokens are currently listed but a third is waiting for regulators’ OK, and some 200 other companies are in “late-stage” discussions to issue digital securities with tZERO ATS.      “We believe that as we get more assets trading, it will attract interest from other investors,” Noursalehi said. “In particular, as existing digital securities move onto our platform, all of the investors that hold those securities will onboard and become our customers.""      COVID-19 has slowed tZERO’s march. In the earnings call, Noursalehi said the coronavirus and its ensuing market volatility has made new issuers hesitant to jump in until trading cools down to a more regular clip.      “Issuers have largely sidelined trading existing digital securities until market conditions normalize, so tZERO has seen a slowdown in issuers looking to raise capital. That said, conversations do continue,” said Overstock CEO Jonathan Johnson during the earnings call.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | XTZ,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/01/overstock-wants-to-trade-traditional-stocks-on-tzero-crypto-app,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/903e318acd6dff33bc9b0083d0f98e3ea9edf92b-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431881,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN6uTh,1588333634,First Mover: Tezos Led Crypto Market With Twice Bitcoin’s Gains in April,"Bitcoin? Ether? Ripple? Meh. During a month where cryptocurrencies zoomed, the lesser-known Tezos beat them all.      Tezos (XTZ), one of the largest and most prominent among a fast-growing roster of digital coins known as “staking tokens,” jumped 83% in April, the most among cryptocurrencies with a market value of at least $1 billion, based on data from Messari.      You're reading First Mover, CoinDesk's daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      That’s more than double the 37% gain for bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market value, which benefited from speculation that an inflation hedge will come in handy as the Federal Reserve and other central banks inject trillions of dollars of emergency liquidity into the global financial system.      Ether (ETH) rose 62% alongside a surge in growth for U.S. dollar-linked stablecoins built atop the Ethereum blockchain, and as investor interest grew in the white-hot arena of decentralized finance. Ripple's XRP, a payments token, rose 30%.      Staking tokens give holders the right to weigh in on a blockchain’s governance — similar to the way shareholders vote for a company’s board of directors — while also giving them the ability to earn a share of newly minted tokens, in the manner of a dividend or bond coupon.      The strong performance of Tezos is “likely in part due to increased investor interest in staking-based returns,” said Joseph Todaro, managing partner at Blocktown Capital, an investment firm specializing in digital currencies.  Some cryptocurrency exchanges offer staking as a service to make it easier for investors to participate, and Tezos has benefited recently from new listings on the exchanges Bitfinex and Binance. It’s been on Coinbase, another exchange, since last year.  Ethereum, whose native token ether is the second-biggest cryptocurrency after bitcoin, plans to upgrade to a staking model in July. Some analysts say ether has generated additional enthusiasm among speculators due to the transition to staking.      Tezos has doubled on a year-to-date basis, despite a bout of volatility along with bitcoin, ether and other tokens earlier this year.      One caveat for traders is that Tezos has a market value of just $2.1 billion, less than 1/70th of bitcoin. So Tezos has the potential for big losses alongside any fast gains, even when compared with the notoriously volatile bitcoin; in March, Tezos tumbled 41% as bitcoin slid 24%.      “The price movement of any given crypto asset is partially dependent on current investing narratives,” said Todaro.      Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $8,995 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $8,9958 | 24-Hr Low: $8,415      Trend: Bitcoin is on the rise, having bounced up from its key average support early Friday.      The original cryptocurrency is trading near $8,995 at press time (updated), representing over 4% gains. Prices defended an ascending 50-hour average support during Asian trading hours.      The average has consistently restricted downside and reversed pullbacks in the recent rally that pushed bitcoin from $6,800 to $9,400. As a result, the immediate bias will remain bullish as long as prices are trading above the 50-hour average, which is currently at $8,751.      If the latest bounce from the average support ends up clearing the immediate resistance at $8,913, bitcoin will likely revisit $9,200.      While the hourly chart is reporting bullish conditions, the daily chart studies also show buyer exhaustion. It's possible there could be a break below the 50-hour average support, which would take bitcoin down to $8,500.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/01/first-mover-tezos-led-crypto-market-with-twice-bitcoins-gains-in-april,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a57b21f728613d5e42ef1aa802a346875c8ca898-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431839,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN6uNh,1588330811,Bitcoin Rises Back to $8.8K Even as US Stock Futures Drop,"Bitcoin is up again Friday as losses are seen in U.S. stock futures.      Following a rise of 23% over the last two days, though, the rally looks overstretched and the gains may be short-lived.      At press time, the biggest cryptocurrency by market value is trading near $8,860, representing a 2.8 percent gain on the day, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index. Prices have risen from lows near $8,600 seen earlier today.      Meanwhile, the futures tied to the S&P 500, Wall Street's equity index, are down over 2 percent.      Renewed growth concerns seem to be weighing on the futures market. Amazon, the world's largest online retailer, warned of a possible second-quarter loss late Thursday, and Apple declined to give a financial forecast for the first time in a decade.      Read more: First Mover: Tezos Led Crypto Market With Twice Bitcoin’s Gains in April      Further, fears of fresh U.S.-China trade war gripped markets in Asia after President Trump threatened China with retaliatory tariffs over the coronavirus outbreak. Trump accused China of unleashing the virus into the world due to some awful mistake, and even suggested the release could have been intentional.      All this economical gloom may, though, bodes well for bitcoin, as some analysts consider bitcoin a safe haven like gold. That belief has been reinforced by the cryptocurrency's stellar recovery rally from the March 13 low of $3,867.      Bitcoin is also widely expected to maintain its upward trajectory in the days leading up to the mining reward halving, due on May 12.      Key on-chain metrics also suggest investor confidence in the ongoing rally. Both small and large investors, popularly known as ""whales,"" seem to be accumulating coins ahead of the halving.      Exchange balances declined to 2,357,741 BTC on Thursday to hit the lowest level since May 27, according to data provided by blockchain intelligence firm Glassnode. The metric, which suggests a holding mentality among investors, has dropped by over 10 percent since March 13.      ""Overall, on-chain fundamentals are recovering to pre-crash levels,"" noted Glassnode in its weekly report.      While the odds appear stacked in favor of stronger gains toward $10,000 in the short term, the technical charts are signaling overbought conditions and scope for price pullback.    Daily chart    Bitcoin formed a bearish ""pin bar"" candle on Thursday, which comprises a long upper shadow and small red body with little or no lower shadow. The pattern is indicative of rejection, or bull failure, at higher prices.      The pin bar is also considered an early sign of bearish trend reversal if it appears after a notable price rally, as is the case here.      Alongside that, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is reporting overbought conditions with an above-70 reading.      Read more: Bitcoin Whale Addresses Hit Highest Number Since August 2019      As a result, a drop to the 200-day average at $8,000 may be seen before a potential rally into five figures. ""People must be careful of the price pullback. Bitcoin may revisit the $8,000-$8,500 for a while, before making another attempt at $10,000 in the run-up to the halving,"" said Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank.      Thursday's high of $9,485 is the level to beat for the bulls. Chart analysts consider a failed pin bar as a powerful bullish signal. So, if prices find acceptance above $9,485 on Friday, a stronger rally to levels above $10,000 may be seen.

42431837,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN6uDh,1588325400,"Argo Blockchain Sees Revenues Soar 11x After Mining 1,300 Bitcoin in 2019","Argo Blockchain, a bitcoin mining firm listed on the London Stock Exchange, reported stellar 2019 earnings Wednesday. The company attributed its success to cutting off its consumer-facing arm and focusing on mining some 1,330 bitcoin (BTC) on the year.      In its full-year results, Argo said 2019 revenue was up 11-fold from the year before, a dramatic spike from $948,000 to $10.7 million. Argo's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) came to $1.74 million, compared to a $4.56 million loss in 2018.      While partly the result of a significant capital outlay into mining equipment – with the number of active rigs increasing from 10,000 to 17,000 by year's end – the company said it also made savings by moving from its original mining-as-a-service (MaaS) business to mining for itself.      Whole areas of the business, including customer support and acquisition, could be axed, the report said, with significant reductions also being made in the marketing budget. The company also shrunk its headcount from 11 to seven.    Looking forward    CEO Peter Wall told CoinDesk the company's pivot last year means it can now focus all of its energies on optimizing mining equipment and remain competitive against its rivals. He said the move puts Argo in a good position to deal with the volatility and uncertainty from the COVID-19 pandemic and the upcoming bitcoin halving event.      ""The lockdown in the first half of 2020 has thrown a curveball into the global economy, which is being felt everywhere,"" Wall said. ""However, given the crucial infrastructure investment Argo made last year, we now find ourselves in a very good place.""      Read more: The Rise of ASICs: A Step-by-Step History of Bitcoin Mining      Argo originally set out to offer mining services via a subscription model. The premise was that this would make crypto mining accessible to just about anyone, co-founder and then-executive chairman Jonathan Bixby told the Financial Times in 2018.      But costs soon outstripped revenues, and Argo reported a pre-tax loss of $4.1 million in its 2018 financial report. The share price, which had been £12.50 ($15.55) at the IPO in August 2018, sunk to a low of £3.00 ($3.74) by the following February.      As Argo faced the very real threat of a shareholder revolt, the company pivoted into mining for itself, increasing the number of mining rigs by 1,000 in May 2019. Argo continued its capital outlay so that by August 2019, co-founder Mike Edwards, who had replaced Bixby as new executive chairman, expressed confidence the firm was in solid health.      Wednesday's results come three months after Argo first said 2019 had been a strong year. In January, it released unaudited figures that indicated the company was looking at a ten-fold revenue increase, which sparked a 3.55% increase in the share price.      Read more: London-Listed Argo Blockchain Reports Tenfold Increase in Bitcoin Mining Revenue in 2019      Wall said the full-year results meant the company entered 2020 with ""considerable business momentum"" and that it was ""on track to deliver strong growth in the first half [of 2020] compared with the corresponding period the year before.""      The new executive chairman, Ian McLeod, who took over the position in January, said 2019's strong revenues allowed Argo to put pressure on the competition, especially smaller miners using outdated equipment.      He also expressed ""cautious optimism"" in the macro backdrop, adding that looser monetary policy could contribute to a waning, if not full collapse, in confidence in fiat currencies. Cryptocurrencies, and especially bitcoin, McLeod said, could stand to benefit as investors hunt for stores of value independent of governments and central banks.      Having already mined more than 900 bitcoin in Q1 2020, Argo is well on track to exceed the 1,300 bitcoin the company mined in 2019. The company is on track to soon hit 18,000 rigs – with a combined hash power of 730 Petahash (PH).

42431833,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN6u9h,1588320000,Why Crypto Exchange OKCoin Jumped Through Hoops to Get Licensed in Japan,"After more than two years, San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange OKCoin received its license as a Virtual Currency Service Provider in March from the Kanto Local Finance Bureau in Japan.      While the country is known for its retail market, the exchange is betting on Japan’s strict licensing regime to attract the institutional investors OKCoin specializes in serving.      “Japan is famous for having a lot of money,” said John Feng, CEO of OKCoin Japan, a subsidiary of blockchain services company OK Group. “In Japan, the rate of return is low on any asset for real estate and the stock market because interest rates are so low. Asset management companies and large institutional insurance companies want a little higher return on their assets.”      Feng also hopes to see the strict regulatory regime in Japan draw more international exchanges into the market.      “It’s like the foreign exchange market. You have multinationals that come to Japan and make things more attractive for investors,” Feng said.      Read more: Crypto Exchange OKCoin Appoints New CEO to Drive US Expansion      Japan is also the second-largest source of crypto-trading traffic after the U.S. and the Japanese yen is the third-strongest currency after the dollar and the euro, Feng added.      Once one of China's “Big 3” crypto exchanges, OKCoin had to move to San Francisco after its fiat-to-crypto trading was banned in late 2017. The firm’s client base includes customers from China, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, the U.S., Europe, Russia and Turkey.      “If the large financial institutions see the top exchanges coming to Japan, then they will feel more safe,” Feng said.    Long road    OKCoin Japan’s journey towards a license in Japan began back in 2017.      In the first eight months after the crypto law was passed, Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) licensed 16 exchanges. Licensing became more difficult, however, after the cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck lost more crypto in a hack than Mt. Gox did in 2013, which happened 10 days after OKCoin submitted its application. Since then, the FSA and self-regulatory rules promoted by the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA) have become much more strict.      The Japanese regulator didn’t license any exchanges for a year, and costs began to rise after it resumed its approval process.      Those rising costs were also why crypto exchange Kraken chose to stop operating in Japan back in April 2018.      Licensed exchanges in Japan are considered financial institutions, and their anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) restrictions are just as strict as those imposed on banks in the country.      Read more: Inside the Standards Race for Implementing FATF’s Travel Rule      OKCoin already has a Money Services Business license in the U.S. and is registered with the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). It also has a temporary license in Malta and is pursuing a license in Singapore. Getting a license in one of the most strict regulatory regimes in the world means money transfers will be significantly easier to do under the new FATF travel rule, Feng said.    First outsider    The exchange claims to be the first non-Japanese exchange to have obtained the license by going through the regulatory rigors of FSA instead of purchasing an already-licensed Japanese exchange. Other international firms have bought licensed exchanges in Japan to break into the market, Feng added.      For OKCoin, the licensing process involved building a team of nearly 40 employees and developing a proprietary automated transaction monitoring system. (Before going live with spot trading in July, OKCoin expects to add 10 more staff, and other exchanges have hired third-party developers to create a monitoring system.)      The FSA’s next move will include amendments to the Japan Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and Japan Payment Services Act effective May 1, which will create tougher restrictions for exchanges wanting to enable crypto derivatives trading. These amendments caused crypto exchange BitMEX to pull parts of it business out of the country. However, OKCoin plans to work another six months to receive that license. After all, around 80% of trading in Japan is derivatives trading, Feng said.      While the company doesn’t need the same capital requirements as a regulated bank, OKCoin is looking to build more capital to keep a healthy balance sheet as it grows into the new market and partners with other financial institutions, Feng added.

Currently, there are only around four or five banks in Japan willing to serve crypto firms, Yagami said. (One of Elliptic’s goals is to make banks more comfortable banking crypto firms.)      Japanese banks also have to come out of their own crisis of negative interest rates and the pandemic-induced recession before they’re able to think about expanding into new unknown business lines such as crypto, Yagami added.      While the road to obtaining a license to trade crypto derivatives will include even tougher restrictions, getting that license will give OKCoin a chance to flex its crypto derivatives services.      “That’s the most popular service we’re known for,” Feng said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/05/01/why-crypto-exchange-okcoin-jumped-through-hoops-to-get-licensed-in-japan,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9220ec060b579ffe543dc1e0732f18b6a29e6bbc-2002x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
