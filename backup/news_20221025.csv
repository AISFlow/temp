Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin has a rare day to celebrate, surging past $20K; ether surpasses $1.5K. Axie's AXS tokens get swept up in short squeeze despite the risk that some recipients of an ""unlock"" might soon move to dump their holdings.

Prices  Bitcoin Has a Rare Swing Upwards  By James Rubin  After weeks in the doldrums, bitcoin finally swung higher Tuesday.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $20,300, up nearly 5% over the past 24 hours as chronically risk-averse investors drew encouragement from a number of big brands’ third-quarter earnings reports. BTC last topped $20,000 on Oct. 5.  ""Volatility returned to crypto markets,"" wrote research group Fundstrat in its daily crypto report.  Ether (ETH) was even more buoyant, sprinting past $1,500, up more than 11%, to its highest level since the underlying Ethereum blockchain's Merge last month. The technological overhaul on Sept. 15 shifted the protocol from proof-of-work to more energy-efficient proof-of-stake.  Other major altcoins were solidly in the green, with ADA and SOL recently rising more than 13% and 11%, respectively. UNI, the native token of the Uniswap decentralized exchange, recently jumped more than 8%.  Axie Infinity, a crypto gaming project, unlocked millions of previously restricted AXS tokens for sale, and the early indication from blockchain data was that some recipients were preparing to dump the holdings. But the AXS price rose instead of falling because the day's crypto rally triggered a short squeeze.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures the performance of a basket of cryptocurrencies, climbed 5.59% over the past 24 hours.  BTC’s surge could be attributed to “limited volatility in the past month” and “a market looking for signs of life,” wrote Riyad Carey, a research analyst at crypto data firm Kaiko.  In traditional markets, U.S. stocks continued their recent winning ways, rising for a third consecutive day as investors savored the upbeat third-quarter earnings reports from the likes of Coca-Cola and automotive giant GM. The tech-focused Nasdaq jumped 2.2%, while the S&P 500, which has a strong tech component, and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) climbed 1.6% and 1.1%, respectively.  The earnings season continues, with embattled social media monolith Meta reporting its latest quarterly results on Wednesday. Tech firms have been among the hardest hit in this year’s stock bloodbath.  Following two consecutive monthly gains, the widely watched Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index sank. “Consumers’ expectations regarding the short-term outlook remained dismal,” said Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at the Conference Board. Investors will scrutinize housing starts and durable goods orders on Wednesday and the University of Michigan’s monthly Consumer Sentiment Index on Friday.  Insights  China's Bitcoin-Funded Intelligence Operation Is All About the Chips  By Sam Reynolds  Crypto seems to be at the center of many espionage and counter-intelligence operations, and a recent case involving two intelligence officers from the People's Republic of China caught on U.S. soil trying to bribe an undercover FBI agent with bitcoin just continues the trend.  The unsealed deposition presented Monday by the U.S. Department of Justice shows the two spies were likely operating at the behest of Huawei as the timeline correlates to Huawei’s case in the U.S. a few years ago. With unspecific language, it shows that the intelligence officers were trying to get nonpublic information about the U.S. government’s investigations into Huawei.  So what exactly were these spies after?  Chip supply on everyone’s mind  At the time, of special concern to Huawei would be how potential charges might affect its supply of high-end semiconductors, which are largely U.S. designed and manufactured on equipment that’s U.S. made.  Huawei and officials in Beijing knew that the U.S. officials had already banned the export of Intel’s supercomputing grade Xeon chips, used in data centers, to some of China’s largest universities, on the pretense that they were being used to assist nuclear weapons research in 2015.  Were officials planning on also creating a scheme that would invoke an export ban for chips to companies that were found guilty of criminality? What about a general chip ban to China on the grounds of national security? These were questions to which a source in the FBI would likely have answers.  Eventually, Beijing’s worst fears were realized. Huawei was included in revised guidelines covered by the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) in 2019, which has severely complicated its ability to participate in the global semiconductor supply chain. BIS is responsible for protecting U.S. national security and foreign policy interests related to export licensing policies and procedures.  In 2020, the world’s leading semiconductor fabrication company, Taiwan Semiconductor, stopped accepting Huawei orders, cutting the company off from the ability to produce its chips with the latest technology.  The U.S. government’s case against Huawei was paused when the company’s chief financial officer entered into a deferred prosecution deal as of Sept. 24, 2021. With the DPA, the CFO admitted to criminal wrongdoing (but not guilt) in exchange for the charges to be stayed.  A DPA does not mean the trial has been concluded. Think of it as probation, which expires this coming December. Charges can be re-issued – and admissions used as evidence – should the company or anyone named violate the agreed-upon terms. If everyone behaves, the charges get dismissed when the DPA expires.  As such, the intelligence officers kept their communication with the FBI agent active throughout late 2021 and into 2022. Among China watchers and industry analysts, it was well known that the DOJ’s investigation remained ongoing. The officers could have also been looking for an early warning on future export bans.  Other charges?  We don’t yet know if the DOJ will announce another series of charges against Huawei. What we do know, however, is that in the last year the Chinese semiconductor industry has been hit hard by another round of sanctions.  New export curbs prohibit U.S. nationals from working at Chinese semiconductor companies. The fastest chips from Nvidia, which can be used to run the latest artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning algorithms, have been prohibited from being exported to China (which impacts Huawei’s high-performance computer division). Even domestically made-in-China competitors to Nvidia's chips can’t be fabricated because TSMC’s compliance department is too spooked to allow it on their fabs.  All these are things that Huawei and its counterparts in PRC state security would have loved to get a heads-up on, especially as they all are pieces of a larger puzzle on a trial against the company that might happen in the coming months.  But it seems like all they got for their bitcoin was a lot of disinfo, designed to disrupt their intelligence-gathering efforts and obscure true intent. And once again bitcoin played a pivotal role in all of this.

Turkey is poised to launch a central bank digital currency (CBDC) next year.  Turkey’s Presidential Annual Program for 2023, presented on Monday by the Presidential Strategy and Budget Directorate, contains the discussion of a central bank digital currency.  The announcement came a year after Turkey's central bank announced in September 2021 that it was considering issuing a CBDC to complement its existing payments infrastructure, in a project entitled “Central Bank Digital Turkish Lira Research and Development.”  The Balance of Payments section of the program, under the sub-heading of Policies and Measures, stated that a “blockchain-based central bank digital currency will be put into practice.” The responsible institution is Turkey’s central bank, with the cooperation of the local Ministry of Finance and Scientific and Technological Research Institution.  “The Digital Turkish Lira system will be integrated with digital identity and FAST,” the official report stated. FAST is a payment system operated by the Turkish central bank.  The report also stated that the Turkish central bank will carry out the research and development efforts and testing of its CBDC in collaboration with other banks.

42415332,StAfe08axvsa87cUIBd576,1666733937,"Crypto Game Axie's AXS Tokens Get Unlocked, Recipients Send $5.7M Worth to Exchanges","Axie Infinity, the play-to-earn crypto game that rose to sudden popularity last year, started releasing previously restricted AXS tokens to early investors and insiders as part of a massive $200 million unlocking event.  The unlock came with an unexpected bit of drama: a swift rally in crypto markets that wiped out some traders who had been betting that dumping by long-time holders might result in a price decline. The short squeeze drove up the price, possibly making the market conditions even more tempting for would-be dumpers.  Crypto traders have been monitoring the timing of the token vesting period, partly because of the possibility that some investors might choose to sell their holdings, which could theoretically drive down the price. Vesting refers to the period of time when certain investors and insiders have to wait before claiming their assets; the point is to ensure they are invested for the long-term and prevent immediate sales. Once the vesting period expires – and the tokens become unlocked – all's fair game.  Blockchain data shows that a wallet tagged as “Axie Infinity: Token Vesting” transferred some 785,334 AXS tokens ($6.6 million worth) to six recipients. The recipients were listed as Axie’s advisors and early investors in a private sale round in mid-2020, according to the site TokenUnlock.  Some 21.5 million AXS (worth $200 million) are about to be released in the upcoming days. About 10 million tokens unlocking are for early investors, advisors and the developer team, potentially creating selling pressure for the coin.  Digital asset management firm Arca, one of the institutional investors that purchased AXS during the private sale, received $4 million in AXS (437,500 tokens) to a wallet linked to the company. Then, it deposited all the tokens crypto exchange FTX, according to blockchain data from Etherscan and Nansen. Arca representatives didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.  Another early investor claimed $1.7 million in AXS (187,500 tokens), and soon moved the tokens to crypto exchange Binance, blockchain data shows.  Transferring coins to exchanges indicate that these investors may dump their holdings, pocketing an immense profit on their original investment. Investors who participated in the private sale bought AXS at 8 cents. Given that the crypto currently trades at around $9, they may pocket a 11,150% profit on their initial stake.  Crypto investment firms DeFiance Capital and Delphi Digital can claim $1.5 million (160,000 tokens) and $6.8 million (750,000 tokens), respectively, according to TokenUnlock. Blockchain data indicates that they are yet to obtain their share of tokens.  Owners of the wallet addresses have been identified by blockchain intelligence platform Nansen.  Short squeeze  Crypto traders anticipated that AXS’s price would drop after the unlocking, similar to previous events.  Prior to the unlock, AXS was one of the worst-performing crypto assets by dropping 24% in a week, according to Messari. Traders positioned themselves for dropping further, building up shorts – bets designed toprofit from an asset’s price fall – and funding rates tilted overwhelmingly negative on most exchanges, according to data by Coinglass.  AXS, however, surged 7% in the last 24 hours amid a recent market-wide rebound, catching shorts by off-guard.  The whiplash liquidated $1.6 million short positions, the most in at least three months.  At press time, AXS is changing hands at $8.99, more than 90% down from its previous all-time high last year.

42411708,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfJq1,1666732600,Inflationary and Deflationary Cryptocurrencies: What’s the Difference?,"In the United States, inflation is at a 40-year high. Prices are rising faster than wages, causing some people to pour their money into alternative assets touted as inflation hedges, like bitcoin (BTC) – the native cryptocurrency of the Bitcoin network.  But did you know that bitcoin is also technically an inflationary asset? Ether (the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum), is also inflationary – for now– and dogecoin’s supply has no upper limit. By contrast, some cryptocurrencies are deflationary.  Their creators hoped that decreasing the token supply over time would increase their value. Here’s what you need to know.  Inflation and crypto – a primer  If a currency is subject to inflation, it means that its purchasing power will fall over time. In other words, each unit of that currency – one U.S. dollar, euro or bitcoin – cannot be used to buy as much as it used to.  Central bankers don’t think that inflation is always bad – at low, stable levels it encourages people to spend, thereby stimulating economic growth. But too much of a good thing is not healthy; inflation can hurt if you aren’t receiving a proportionately larger salary, and volatile inflation makes it difficult to budget effectively.  The U.S. Federal Reserve tries to keep the inflation of fiat currencies at around 2%. By contrast, cryptocurrencies are decentralized, meaning there isn’t a central bank. Crypto developers play that role, and some decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) also vote on a project’s tokenomics, although voting is decentralized across token holders.  Many cryptocurrencies have fixed issuances. The Bitcoin protocol, for instance, decreases the issuance of new bitcoin at a fixed rate, and once all 21 million bitcoin have been mined – predicted to be sometime next century – nobody can mint any more.  Read more: How Does Bitcoin Mining Work?  Inflationary cryptocurrencies  Some cryptocurrencies are inherently inflationary, meaning the number of coins in circulation rises over time. New cryptocurrencies can be mined into existence – that’s how Bitcoin works – or issued to proof-of-stake validators.  Issuing new cryptocurrencies to network actors encourages participation. Some inflationary currencies have fixed supplies, while others have unlimited supplies – there is no limit to the number of tokens that could be in circulation.  Dogecoin, for instance, has an unlimited supply after one of its creators, Jackson Palmer, abolished a hard cap of 100 billion DOGE in February 2014. That means increases in supply could outpace increases in demand, potentially decreasing the value of each individual dogecoin over time.  Read more: What Advisors Should Know About Crypto and Inflation  Coins like bitcoin are inflationary to a point. There is a hard cap in place, but the protocol has disinflationary measures – those that slow the rate of inflation over time. The main one is the “halving” that cuts the amount of bitcoin miners receive approximately every four years  Deflationary cryptocurrencies  The supply of some cryptocurrencies deflates over time, meaning that so long as demand remains consistent (a big hypothetical) the price of each individual coin will rise.  Binance coin (BNB) is one example of a deflationary currency. The Binance cryptocurrency exchange burns – destroys – BNB each quarter to reduce its supply until the token’s supply hits 100 million BNB.  Mixing and matching  Like central banks, some cryptocurrencies employ deflationary, inflationary and disinflationary mechanics to keep the price in check.  Ethereum, whose ether was once a purely inflationary coin, in August 2021 implemented a mechanic called EIP-1559 that burns tokens instead of handing them to miners. At times of high network activity, burn rates have temporarily made the coin deflationary, meaning that more tokens are destroyed than created.  XRP, too, has deflationary mechanics – the token is burned to pay for transactions. But in 2017, Ripple, the company that manages XRP, placed tens of billions of XRP in escrow to prevent a market dump. It periodically releases them into the market, thereby increasing the circulating supply. Messari notes, “At the current burn rate, it would take 20 years for the XRP Ledger to burn what is distributed by Ripple and its founders every day.”  These days, decentralized autonomous organizations can influence the rate of inflation. DAOs vote to release funds locked up in community treasuries, for instance, by determining staking rewards and setting vesting periods for early investors.",NEUTRAL,BTC | DOGE | BNB,BTC | DOGE | FIAT | MARKET | BNB,Robert Stevens,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/inflationary-and-deflationary-cryptocurrencies-whats-the-difference,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4b99804dab35d12e4ff5e55c3d7c96e10fbd1a3d-2273x1318.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411710,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfJzw,1666732185,What Is Tokenomics and Why Is It Important?,"A portmanteau of “token” and “economics,” tokenomics is a catch-all for the elements that make a particular cryptocurrency valuable and interesting to investors. That includes everything from a token’s supply and how it’s issued to things like what utility it has.  Tokenomics is an important concept to consider when making an investment decision because ultimately a project that has smart and well-designed incentives to buy and hold tokens for the long haul is more likely to outlast and do better than a project that hasn't built an ecosystem around its token. A well-built platform often translates into higher demand over time as new investors flock to the project, which, in turn, boosts prices.  Likewise, when launching a project, founding members and developers need to consider the tokenomics of their native cryptocurrency carefully if their project is to attract investment and be successful.  Core features of tokenomics  The structure of a cryptocurrency’s economy determines the incentives that encourage investors to buy and hold a specific coin or token. Just like how fiat currencies are all different, each cryptocurrency has its own monetary policy.  Tokenomics determine two things about a crypto economy – the incentives that set out how the token will be distributed and the utility of the tokens that influence its demand. Supply and demand has a huge impact on price, and projects that get the incentives right can surge in value.  Here are the main variables that developers change that affect tokenomics:  Mining and staking – For base layer blockchains, like Ethereum 1.0 and Bitcoin, mining is the core incentive for a decentralized network of computers to validate transactions. Here, new tokens are given to those who devote their computing power to discovering new blocks, filling them with data and adding them to the blockchain. Staking rewards those who fulfill a similar role but by locking away a number of coins in a smart contract instead – this is how blockchains like Tezos operate, and it’s the model that Ethereum’s moving toward with its 2.0 upgrade.  Yields – Decentralized finance platforms offer high yields to incentivize people to buy and stake tokens. Tokens are staked in liquidity pools – huge pools of cryptocurrencies that power things like decentralized exchanges and lending platforms. These yields are paid out in the form of new tokens.  Token burns – Some blockchains or protocols ""burn"" tokens – permanently remove them from circulation – to reduce the supply of coins in circulation. According to the laws of supply and demand, reducing a token’s supply should help to support its price as the remaining tokens in circulation become more scarce. In August 2021, Ethereum started to burn a portion of tokens sent as transaction fees instead of sending them to miners.  Limited vs unlimited supplies – Tokenomics determines a token’s maximum supply. Bitcoin’s tokenomics, for instance, dictates that no more than 21 million coins can ever be mined, with the last coin expected to enter circulation around the year 2140. Ethereum, by contrast, has no maximum limit, although its issuance each year is capped. NFT (non-fungible token) projects take scarcity to the extreme; some collections might mint only a single NFT for a piece of art.  Token allocations and vesting periods – Some crypto projects account for a detailed distribution of tokens. Often, a certain number of tokens are reserved for venture capitalists or developers, but the catch is that they can sell those tokens only after a certain time. That naturally has an effect on the circulating supply of the coin over time. Ideally, a project’s team will have implemented a system where tokens are distributed in such a way that it reduces the impact to the circulating supply and a token’s price as much as possible.  Who decides?  All of these decisions are made at the protocol level, and most tokenomics are baked into a particular cryptocurrency’s computer code by its founding developers.  Before a cryptocurrency is released, its tokenomics are often outlined in a corresponding white paper, which is an in-depth document that explains what the proposed cryptocurrency will do as well as how it and any underlying technology will work.  The most famous of these is the Bitcoin white paper which laid out the foundation for the first functional digital currency powered by a distributed ledger technology called blockchain. Critically, it laid out a solution for the “double-spend” problem that had prevented digital payments and cashless spending from succeeding before. You can read it here.  Read more: Crypto Arbitrage Trading: How to Make Low-Risk Gains  Crazy tokenomics – game theory in action  The list above lays out the groundwork for tokenomics, but that’s just the start. Cryptocurrencies are essentially a free pass to introduce any type of game theory the creators would like.  Many tokens are so-called utility tokens, meaning that they have a specific purpose within a particular ecosystem – AMP, for instance, is used for a decentralized escrow system, and Index Coop’s DeFi Pulse Index token powers a decentralized index fund for top DeFi tokens  Game theory is an economic concept that assumes that traders are rational actors, and given certain incentives will eventually settle on the optimal choice (like staking ETH to earn high returns, mining bitcoin and so on). Compare, for instance, two wildly different tokenomic schedules: that of Olympus DAO, the contentious decentralized reserve currency project, and that of Loot, the NFT character sheet game created by entrepreneur and computer programmer Dom Hofmann, who co-founded the video-hosting service Vine.  In the past few years, token holders have been able to vote on rules that define a cryptocurrency’s economy by voting using tokens through decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs. A DAO might vote, for instance, to change the number of tokens issued to stakers – those who pledge tokens to validate transactions.  Olympus DAO, for instance, operated a kind of huge decentralized money-market fund, where those who wanted to create a reliable reserve currency benefited from additional funds joining the pool. According to the project’s game theory model (popularized by the meme (3,3)), the most rational choice was to stake OHM into the protocol’s auto-compounding protocol.  This was due to the tokenomics of the protocol; by staking OHM, you would strengthen the decentralized reserve currency and allow people to buy more bonds. If everyone sold OHM, that would hurt the price of the protocol and all holders would get hit. So, you can see how the protocol’s tokenomics incentivized people to buy and stake the token.  Tokenomics don’t always go to plan. Eventually, lots of people did sell OHM, after investors using an OHM liquidity pool on a third-party platform were liquidated. That caused the price to fall dramatically, scaring other investors away from the token.  Loot, on the other hand, is an NFT project created by Hofmann. Its tokenomics let anyone buy Loot as soon as it launched; the 10,000 character sheets, which listed items that characters in an as-yet-to-be-created game would use, sold out almost instantly. The tokenomics of Hofmann’s game revolved around scarcity; because there were only 10,000 character sheets and were hyped up on Twitter, they became immensely valuable.  Token governance and decentralized coordination  Governance plays a huge role in tokenomics these days. Lots of tokens function as so-called governance tokens, meaning that holders are granted voting rights to influence the future rules and decisions of a project. This is all in the name of decentralization; instead of a centralized group of developers calling the shots, token holders can vote on how the platform should be run.  Think of governance tokens like stock in a public company, albeit one without a CEO.  DeFi platforms operate through DAOs – the name given to a governance system that relies on token governance. Holders can vote on anything: As of this writing, for instance, Uniswap’s DAO is discussing whether to deploy Uniswap V3 to Polygon’s proof-of-stake chain and Gnosis Chain.  Tokenomics are crucial to the success of a project; just as a reckless CEO can run a company into the ground, poor governance decisions can kill off top DeFi projects.  If all else fails, it’s always possible to force a new tokenomic schedule into existence by ""hard forking"" a cryptocurrency – a process of copying a blockchain’s codebase, making a few non-backward compatible changes and migrating old cryptocurrencies and validators onto the new network.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING,Robert Stevens,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-is-tokenomics-and-why-is-it-important,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/df51aa899cd1ee28af60efc18754269b903df49a-2309x1299.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

With much of the mining industry struggling mightily under the weight of the bitcoin bear market, CleanSpark has been among those taking advantage by acquiring operations and assets at discounted prices.  Most recently, CleanSpark bought competitor Mawson Infrastructure Group’s (MIGI) mining facility in Sandersville, Georgia, and 6,468 latest-generation mining rigs for up to $42.5 million. The company also purchased 10,000 new Bitmain Antminer S19j Pros for $28 million – a significant markdown from the manufacturer's listed price.  “The effective deployment of our capital strategy has allowed us to exceed hashrate expectations,” said Chief Financial Officer Gary Vecchiarelli. “Crucial to that strategy has been our long-held commitment to selling a portion of the bitcoin we mine to fund growth and operations.""  CleanSpark has four owned and operated facilities with about 50,000 bitcoin mining machines operational. The company expects its 2023 year-end hashrate to be 22.4 EH/s.

42393880,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brbSw3,1666726808,Asset Managers Add to Bitcoin Long Positions Ahead of Price Increase: Crypto Markets Analysis,"Institutional investor appetite for bitcoin may be rising despite BTC’s persistently flat trading range.  The ""Commitment of Traders"" report, released each Friday and reflecting data as of the prior Tuesday, shows that asset managers’ open interest in BTC is now 84% long and 16% short.  The latest figures represent a slight increase from the prior week’s report where asset managers were 80% long (expectation of a rise) and 20% short (expectation of a decline). We’ve seen this metric trend moderately higher since Sept. 6, when asset managers were 74% long BTC.  Asset managers’ holdings show how they are using the large amounts of capital at their disposal, and offer a window into market sentiment.  Prior to Tuesday's crypto price surge, little had changed in bitcoin for weeks. Inflation concerns and macroeconomic uncertainties have driven investor behavior and market volatility. Markets will next be eyeing Thursday’s gross domestic product (GDP) report to gauge economic growth and the likely effects of the Federal Reserve’s hawkish monetary policy.  Current expectations are that the economy grew by 2.4% in the third quarter. This figure would suggest the economy is growing but not too robustly. That would mean the U.S. central bank's interest rate hikes are taming inflation without spurring a steep recession.  One item worth monitoring is a potential shifting relationship between the U.S. dollar and the price of BTC. For much of 2022, BTC and the dollar index (DXY) have maintained an inverse relationship, with the DXY moving higher while BTC trades lower.  Recently that relationship, measured by the correlation coefficient, has narrowed from -0.90 in September, to its current level of -0.54. The correlation coefficient measures the relationship between two assets and ranges from 1 to -1. A reading of 1 implies a direct relationship while -1 reflects the opposite.  While a bit early to take a definitive stance, the DXY has declined since Sept. 27, while BTC has seen relatively little movement over the same time frame. Should DXY and BTC revert to a more inverse price relationship, further declines in the DXY could lead to a quick move higher for BTC.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/25/asset-managers-add-to-bitcoin-longs-ahead-of-price-increase-crypto-markets-analysis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f2f425a76d4b0b02345b27d31ee931ff7a68b102-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The request comes on the heels of the recent appointment of Rishi Sunak as the U.K.’s new prime minister. Sunak announced during his time as finance minister under former Prime Minister Boris Johnson that he wanted to turn the U.K. into “a crypto hub,” but hasn’t said anything more on the matter since then.  On Tuesday, the House of Commons, the lower house of the U.K. Parliament, voted in favor of recognizing crypto assets as regulated financial instruments and products.  Cameron said in a written statement issued to the media on Tuesday that “U.K. crypto and digital asset firms desperately need clarity over the U.K.’s approach to crypto policy and for the government to deliver on its vision for the U.K. crypto sector.”  The MP said that crypto businesses want regulation that provides regulatory clarity and business certainty.  “We need a proportionate approach to regulation that balances risk, ensures high levels of consumer protection and that doesn't hamper growth and innovation in the sector,” Cameron argued.  APPG provides a forum for parliamentarians, regulators and the British government to discuss challenges and opportunities relating to the crypto sector, according to its website.

Monthly MA Of Bitcoin New Addresses Is Currently Retesting The Yearly MA According to the latest weekly report from Glassnode, new address momentum is currently on the verge of a push higher. The &apos;new addresses&apos; is an indicator that measures the total number of new addresses coming active on the Bitcoin blockchain. To know whether the crypto is seeing a sufficient amount of push in new users coming to the network or not, the &apos;new address momentum&apos; metric is used. This momentum indicator is based on the 30-day and 365-day moving averages of the new addresses. By comparing the trend of these MAs against each other, we can learn how the monthly average new users stack up against the mean for the year. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin new address momentum over the last few years: Looks like the two MAs have been approaching a test in recent days | Source: Glassnode&apos;s The Week Onchain - Week 43, 2022 As you can see in the above graph, the relevant points of trend for the Bitcoin new address momentum are highlighted.

42420947,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtw5t,1666723554,‘Basically a Savior’: Why Crypto Is So Popular in Turkey,"It has been a rough year for crypto. Prices have plunged, projects have collapsed and companies are laying off employees. In the U.S., bitcoin does not appear to be acting as the inflation hedge it was supposed to be. Nor has it been a safe haven from the turmoil of the stock market. One might ask: What is the point of crypto, anyway?  A country like Turkey provides some answers. After conversations with nearly two dozen people in the Turkish crypto community, I caught a glimpse of a world in which crypto is not a game, but a necessity.  Crypto fever is palpable in Istanbul. The area around the Grand Bazaar hosts several small businesses where you can just walk in and exchange cash for bitcoin (BTC) or tether (USDT). My colleague said the first thing she saw at Istanbul airport was a huge crypto ad. There are at least 8 million people in Turkey engaged in crypto, according to an estimate in a 2022 research report by the Turkish crypto exchange Paribu, one of the largest crypto exchanges in Turkey. Just last week, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan highlighted the benefits of blockchain technology, while advising young people to stay away from gambling with cryptocurrency. He also said that Turkey wanted to be a producer, not a consumer, in the digital assets world.  Read more: Build on Blockchain, Stay Away From Gambling With Crypto, Turkey’s Erdoğan Says  Of course, Turkey is not immune to the global crypto downturn. Paribu’s 2022 research reports the exchange’s daily trade volume at $145 million, down from $850 million in 2021. But still, local enthusiasm remains strong. Turkey’s crypto community is advocating for Devcon, Ethereum’s biggest developer event, to be held in Istanbul.  There have been various mainstream media articles that describe crypto as a refuge from Turkey’s sky-high inflation and the steep devaluation of the lira. The falling lira is a big part of this story, but it doesn’t fully explain crypto’s local appeal. In Turkey, crypto represents a kind of freedom: from the national currency, from the government’s economic policies and even from the constraints of corporate life.  “Crypto is basically a savior for many individuals here both from a financial perspective, and also from a mental perspective,” said Vidal Arditi, the Istanbul-based founder of Layka DAO and Lunapark Web3 Hub.  Currency woes  First, let’s start with the lira. Turkey’s inflation rate recently surpassed 83%, a 24-year high, though some researchers estimate the inflation rate to be significantly higher. The lira also reached a record low against the U.S. dollar amid the government’s unorthodox policy of cutting interest rates. Critics blame the government’s monetary policy for inflation, while the government has pointed to attacks by “foreign financial tools.”  In Istanbul, the pain is real and anecdotes abound. A restaurant’s menu prices increase frequently. Rent jumps five times from one year to the next. It is nearly impossible, I am told, for a local, white-collar worker to buy a house. Even the crypto roller coaster starts to look like a more sound investment strategy. At times the Turkish lira has, in fact, proved to be more volatile than bitcoin.  “Many don’t believe in the power of the Turkish lira, so they are looking for investment opportunities to keep the value of their money,” said Çağla Gül Şenkardeş, founder of Istanbul Blockchain Women.  Read more: Burak Tamac and Erkan Öz - Lessons From the Turkish Government's Hasty Attempt to Regulate Cryptocurrencies  “Since we are a culture that is quite used to investment alternatives like U.S. dollars or gold, it wasn’t hard for Turkish people to trust another alternative, which is crypto,” she said. “We are quite used to investing in something that is not the lira. We can take risks easily.”  Inflation can make wealth accumulation difficult – even impossible – and this problem is compounded by a lack of other good investment options. Generation Y and the new generation had limited opportunities to invest in companies like Google, Tesla or Facebook, says Tansel Kaya, CEO of Mindstone Blockchain Labs.  “You needed an intermediary to buy those stocks, and even if you could, it was already too late. You could only get them at IPO prices,” he says. Today, by contrast, you can be part of bitcoin or ether’s success.  “Tokens are not a stock, but they still make you part of the project’s success. With crypto, I can get into a seed round, private round or the public initial coin offering.”  Wage gap  Salaries often do not keep up with inflation, meaning earners have decreasing purchasing power. In July Turkey raised the minimum wage for the second time in six months, by 30% to 5,500 lira, which at the time was worth $328. Today, it is already less than $300. Ege Aguş, an engineering student who started investing in crypto when he was 19, also works at a crypto startup while at school.  “Even if you graduate from one of the top engineering schools, the salaries are not high,” he said. “If you work extra, you are not paid for it. I can’t afford to live in some kind of house right now. That’s why we are searching for the easiest way to make money.”  Those who worked in multinational companies also said that Turkish salaries were relatively low. One former Apple employee, who preferred to remain anonymous because of critical views expressed, left Apple to eventually get into crypto. The former Apple employee said this was, in part, because the salary was not enough to offset the devaluation of the lira and the decrease in purchasing power for Turkish employees.  Working in crypto was a more attractive option. “For similar job positions in crypto companies, job benefits and perks were getting better and better. I realized that when I met a friend in a crypto exchange and was offered a job,” the person said. Earning a salary in a different currency like the dollar or in stablecoins such as USDT, USDC or DAI “became a life-saving case for many people.”  Read more: Turan Sert - Why Devcon 7 Should Be in Istanbul  The former Apple employee made sure to emphasize, however, that it was more than cash that was the draw to crypto. It was also the mindset.  “My main motivation has not been just money but to be free in expressing my thoughts and not have the pressure of corporate structures.”  Global entry  Some young people, frustrated by these economic realities, will try to leave Turkey to make a life somewhere else. But for those who either can’t or don’t want to leave their homeland, crypto can act as a kind of virtual passport.  “The good thing about working in Web3 is that you can get out of the country without getting out of the country,” Kaya of Mindstone Blockchain Labs said. “Your work is online. I can get projects in the U.S. I can work with freelancers from Serbia and pay them in crypto. If I want to send money over the banking system during the holidays, I have to wait. With crypto, I just click a button and the money is paid.”  The government may not want to risk alienating millions of crypto users, some of whom see crypto as a lifeline  For startup founders, the decentralized nature of crypto serves as a gateway to global investors. Levent Cem Aydan, the Turkish-born founder of the blockchain gaming incubator Seedify, said that it can be hard for startups to raise big money from Turkish venture capitalists, and raising money abroad is not straightforward either. Visa issues or the sheer cost of travel can make it difficult for Turkish founders to visit Silicon Valley, for example.  He says that Web3 projects, by contrast, might be able to raise funds through an initial DEX offering (IDO) involving a decentralized crypto exchange, or via non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  “If I want to grow a successful project and I want to go global, the best way is to become a blockchain entrepreneur,” he said.  The state  It might seem surprising that Turkey is relatively permissive toward cryptocurrency, which some governments view as a threat to state control. Turkey ranked at 103 out of 167 countries on the Economist Intelligence Unit’s democracy index in 2021. Just this month, Turkey’s parliament passed a law outlawing the spread of so-called disinformation, sparking the concern of free-speech advocates. And yet, even against this backdrop, crypto remains relatively free.  Yes, Turkey’s central bank banned crypto as a form of payment last year, possibly as a reaction to the falling lira. Otherwise, crypto remains largely unregulated. Even as various countries around the world have cracked down on fundraising through initial coin offerings (ICO), Turks can still participate in them.  One possible reason for this lack of regulation is that the Turkish government simply hasn’t gotten around to it yet. All over the world, crypto moves faster than governments’ attempts to regulate it. But there is another, more intriguing theory circulating in Turkish crypto circles. It’s that the Turkish government hasn’t cracked down on crypto because it recognizes how essential it is for a broad swathe of the population.  There is some evidence that Turkish policymakers are indeed concerned about angering crypto users. Last year a grassroots movement helped disrupt the passage of a controversial crypto bill. The draft bill, which was leaked on social media, aimed to restrict international exchanges in Turkey as well as ban self-custody wallets. Anger erupted online and a meeting about the bill was held at the Parliament. Various members of the crypto community shared their concerns, which seemed to have contributed to the postponement of the bill.  Why would the Turkish government care what crypto users think? One possible reason is the upcoming presidential election next year, which may be the ruling party’s toughest re-election to date. In an election where every vote is important, the government may not want to risk alienating millions of crypto users, some of whom see crypto as a lifeline.  “There are about 8 million individuals who actively invest in crypto. If you consider immediate family members, that’s about 14 million people,” Tansel Kaya said.  “There are all these people who are going to vote for the first time. If the government makes a wrong regulation, the opposition will blame them. If you take away their dreams, these voters will remember it.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TOKEN SALE,Emily Parker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/10/25/turkey-cryptocurrency-explained,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c02a9080686bc65ff60f23c9c6119ca98e31dcea-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411718,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfKJm,1666722725,Crypto Trading 101: How to Use Support and Resistance,"Crypto analysts often cite two key markers when predicting whether a price of a given coin or token is set to rise or fall. These markers are psychological “support” or “resistance” lines – price points that offer a sort of floor or ceiling for prices. For instance, an analyst might say bitcoin’s price is struggling to break through a $20,000 resistance layer – meaning investors are showing a reluctance to buy BTC as it nears $20,000.  This article is part of CoinDesk's Trading Week.  Sign up for CoinDesk’s Learn Crypto Investing Course.  On the other side, traders may say there’s “support” around a price point or range for an asset, meaning the price tends to bounce back up whenever the asset nears that price because investors now see it as a bargain, and will swoop in and buy it, stopping further drops in price.  In simplest terms, resistance is where the market stops buying because it deems the asset too expensive, while support is the price where the market sees the asset as a bargain and will buy it.  Once either support or resistance lines are breached, however, technical analysts believe that will cause the price of a cryptocurrency to rise or fall in dramatic fashion.  The “resistance” signal roughly translates to something like, “If bitcoin reaches $20,000, then its price will really fly like the wind!” This is because the analyst assumes that when a cryptocurrency’s price has grown to a certain level, its rise has been significant enough to convince people will buy it in droves. In other words, it has broken through some psychological barrier that has prevented people from buying the coin, and there is now enough gusto for the coin to further go up in price.  But if the market’s winds change, the same analysts might take an opposite tack. “Ah, if bitcoin falls below its support level of $19,500,” they might say, “its price surely will fall much further. Get out while you can!” This is because the analyst assumes that prices have fallen by so much that the market has lost confidence in the coin; if there are no longer enough buyers who consider its price attractive enough to hold, sellers will overpower them. Consequently, the analyst expects the price of the asset to fall.  In a nutshell, these trading signals provide a very rudimentary interpretation of the near future of the market for a cryptocurrency. They are the hallmark of the technical analyst, someone who spends his or her day drawing lines on graphs to determine the future price of an asset, in this instance a cryptocurrency.  The technical analyst relies on historical data to predict the future on the assumption that history repeats itself. These analysts diverge from that other kind of analyst, the fundamental analyst, who values an asset on its inherent qualities. Technical analysts don’t care about that; for them, the crypto market is a numbers game, where past prices and trading volumes inform the future.  See Also: Is Technical Analysis Prophetic or Preposterous? We Asked 7 Crypto Traders  How to interpret support and resistance levels when trading  Support and resistance levels are useful to traders who want indications about the near future of a cryptocurrency’s price. A trader who buys a cryptocurrency ahead of a coin breaking through a predicted “resistance” level could sell for a profit shortly after the coin reaches said level, if the coin has, as predicted, risen in price. The converse is true for those who want signals about when to exit the market before a coin becomes oversaturated.  Technical analysts defer to different methodologies when constructing support or resistance lines on popular analytics platforms, like TradingView. The simplest tool is to draw a horizontal line on a coin's charted movements to look at the peaks and troughs, deducing from these events the prices at which traders are likely to buy the cryptocurrency and pump the price, or sell the cryptocurrency and sink the price.  Others use simple moving average trend lines to spot support and resistance levels, using, for instance, 200-day and 50-day moving average lines to identify points of support and resistance:  Sometimes analysts rely on no firm mathematical methodology at all, instead drawing lines as they please that support their arguments. Because the support is psychological, the market and its analysts tend to put these lines at round numbers like $20,000 or $2,000 or $200. Consider the screenshot below, a price chart of bitcoin onto which an automated script has superimposed support lines:  The advice, according to the technical analysts, is to buy an asset when it bounces off the support level and get out of the trade after the resistance level fails to break.  Other tools to identify support and resistance  Horizontal lines are just one analytic tool in the kit of a technical analyst, as well as using moving averages, which we discussed above.  Another advanced metric used to identify support and resistance is the Fibonacci retracement line.  This identifies potential future ranges from Fibonacci numbers – a sequence of numbers where each entry is 1.618 larger than the preceding number. Cryptocurrency traders use Fibonacci retracement lines because they provide the highest and lowest possible prices in a certain period of time, then dividing the distance on the chart by these Fibonacci ratios to provide glimpses into the future.  Analysts also use Bollinger Bands, another method that provides three trend lines: average prices over a given time period, plus upper and lower trends for that period.  It should be noted that none of these tools provide conclusive insights into the future prices of cryptocurrencies. Instead, they are used to predict prices and should be taken with a pinch of salt.

Granath had sued Wright in Norway to try to preempt a suit in the U.K., which would be based on Granath's comments on social media that Wright had “lied and cheated” in his efforts to prove that he was Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous founder of Bitcoin. The trial in Norway last month looked to settle the yearslong debate of whether the tweets made by Hodlonaut in March 2019 were defamatory against Wright.  Read more: Hodlonaut Wins Norwegian Lawsuit Against Self-Proclaimed ‘Satoshi’ Craig Wright  Last week, Oslo District Court Judge Helen Engebrigtsen ruled in favor of Granath, stating that the prominent Bitcoin community member “had sufficient factual grounds” in his claims that Wright had “lied and cheated” in his efforts to prove that he was Satoshi.  The victory, however, has come at a cost, according to Granath, who said that it’s taken up “enormous amounts of time” and money. He said it has also taken an emotional toll on him. Still, he said that he “remained calm” throughout the case.  Read more: Craig Wright Won’t Give Cryptographic Proof He’s Satoshi, His Lawyers Say at Hodlonaut Trial  The fight isn’t quite over. Wright’s attorneys previously told CoinDesk that Wright would appeal the ruling and warned that “anonymous online bullying” may have a “chilling effect on public discourse.”  Granath hinted at the likelihood that Wright would appeal the verdict, and may even “try to appeal to the [Norwegian] Supreme Court after losing this next appeal.”  Meanwhile, Granath may also face a defamation suit from Wright in the U.K. and predicts that lawsuit will be “extremely expensive to defend.” Wright has yet to pay Granath’s legal fees, which amount to upward of $400,000, Granath said.

The largest cryptocurrency by market value was recently changing hands at $20,134, up more than 4% over the last 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) last topped this level on Oct. 6.  Ether (ETH) was in an equally buoyant mood, sprinting past $1,500 at one point, a roughly 10% gain from Monday, same time, and its highest level since Sept. 15. Other major cryptos were also well into the green as investors recovered their appetite for riskier assets. SOL and ADA were recently up more than 11% and 10%, respectively. Popular meme coin DOGE recently rose almost 5%.  The CoinDesk Market Index was up 3.3% in the past 24 hours.  The Tuesday rally stemmed from “a big earnings week that has thus far gone pretty well,” said Riyad Carey, a research analyst at crypto data firm Kaiko.  Carey added that BTC’s surge could also be attributed to “limited volatility in the past month” and “a market looking for signs of life.”  Crypto prices dovetailed with equity markets that also spiked on positive earnings from a number of global brands, including automotive giant GM and Coca-Cola. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 were up 1.7% and 1.2%, respectively.  In recent weeks, the historically high-volatility bitcoin market has been relatively stable, hovering just above $19,000.  Investors remain focused on the U.S. Federal Reserve’s ongoing efforts to tame inflation without casting the economy into recession. Last week, they received some encouragement from faint signs the Federal Reserve would hike rates less aggressively early next year than its current diet of 75 basis point increases.  Carey said if the interest rate slowdown happened in December, it could well lead to “a crypto rally, but it's uncertain whether it would lead to another bull market.”  But Tom Dunleavy, a senior research analyst at crypto research firm Messari, said that possible regulation will be more important than short-term interest rate trends. Last week, FTX founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried proposed a set of regulatory guidelines for the U.S.  “Regulation is coming to crypto in the fourth quarter, and that will be the biggest determinant of price and adoption for the next six to 12 months,” Dunleavy said.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/25/bitcoin-tops-20k-ether-surges-to-its-highest-point-since-the-merge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9e600e34cd5f03796c547f0f0313bb0370db6dcb-4608x3072.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42415330,StAfe08axvsa87cUIBd54M,1666721003,"Southeast Asia Leads the World in Crypto Adoption, Propelled by Play-to-Earn Gaming: Chainalysis","Vietnam leads the world in grassroots cryptocurrency adoption, according to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis’ latest “Geography of Cryptocurrency” report. The country, which topped the ranking for the second consecutive year, was one of three Southeast Asian countries at the top of the 2022 list.  “Vietnam shows extremely high purchasing power and population-adjusted adoption across centralized, DeFi (decentralized finance), and P2P (peer-to-peer) cryptocurrency tools,” the report says, citing a 2021 poll by Statista that showed 21% of Vietnamese reported they owned cryptocurrencies. On this measure the country is followed closely by the Philippines at 20% penetration, and for both populations play-to-earn gaming and remittances are the main adoption drivers, Chainalysis said.  Once again the ranking is dominated by countries categorized by the World Bank as “lower middle income,” such as Vietnam, Philippines, Ukraine, India, Pakistan and Thailand. Generally, these are economies where the national currency is weak and there is low availability of services for sending or receiving the currency across borders. In such countries, users “rely on cryptocurrency to send remittances, preserve their savings in times of fiat currency volatility and fulfill other financial needs unique to their economies,” the report reads.  Gaming drive  This year’s poll by financial services company Finder shows that about 25% of Filipinos and 23% of Vietnamese are engaging in play-to-earn games. Also, the developer of the once-blockbuster online game Axie Infinity is based in Vietnam, and its wild success in the first half of 2022 inspired more crypto gaming startups to try to find success in the country, Forbes reported.  Axie Infinity, a digital pet game where players raise, trade and fight virtual creatures using non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, for in-game assets, became extremely popular in the region earlier this year, especially in the Philippines, where some players managed to earn significantly more than the country’s average salary. The most successful players used their gaming profits to pay for their kids’ school tuitions and even buy land and houses, CoinDesk reported.  The popularity of Axie Infinity fell in March, when North Korean hackers exploited the Ronin bridge, technology used by Axie to make the game faster. The attackers got away with $625 million in assets, although later the U.S. government was able to recover $30 million. By September, the number of active players was less than one-third than at the game’s peak of popularity in January, according to data from ActivePlayer.  Most of the top leaders in this year’s ranking are located in Central and Southern Asia and Oceania (CSAO). NFT-based gaming is popular and a strong factor attracting new users to crypto in the region, Chainalysis said. “NFT-related websites account for a majority share of DeFi-related web traffic in almost every CSAO country.”  Overall, the CSAO is “a hub for innovation in blockchain-based entertainment,” Chainalysis said. This region is a home for [the] headquarters of Web3 developer Polygon, game developers Immutable X, Stepn and Sky Mavis, which is the creator of Axie Infinity.  Money bridges  Remittances (cross-border money transfers) is another force attracting users to crypto. In Vietnam and the Philippines, which both have a sizable portion of their population working abroad, remittances are essential income. According to the World Bank, remittances form 5% and 9.6% of these countries’ respective GDPs. Given the high remittance fees with traditional money-sending services like Western Union, stablecoins may present a viable alternative.  Remittances remain a very important use case for crypto in Latin America, too, Chainalysis reported. In Mexico alone the crypto company Bitso alone processed about $1 billion in U.S.-to-Mexico remittances in 2022, CoinDesk reported.  African populations also actively use cryptocurrencies for remittances. According to Ray Youssef, CEO of the peer-to-peer crypto marketplace Paxful, the number of the company’s remittances users in Nigeria grew by 55% this year, and Kenyan users increased by even more – 140%.  To some nations, the advantage of using blockchain technology for remittances is becoming obvious enough to take action. For example, Egypt, which gets 8% of its GDP from remittances, in May announced it would begin work on a crypto remittances bridge between Egypt and the UAE, where many Egyptians work.  The picture wasn’t all rosy, however. Where governments have taken a hostile stance on crypto, the pace of adoption has measurably faltered. India and Pakistan, for example, were second and third in last year’s ranking, but in 2022 dropped to fourth and sixth place, respectively.  This year, India implemented a steep 30% tax on crypto profits, along with a 1% tax on every transaction. Pakistan is on its way to a full crypto ban.  Chainalysis’ ranking relies on web traffic data on various cryptocurrency websites provided by Similarweb, plus local experts’ observations, the company said. Chainalysis admits that usage of virtual privacy networks and other anonymizing tools can mislead researchers. However, VPN usage is not widespread enough “to meaningfully skew our data,” the company said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | REGULATION,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/10/25/chainalysis-report-vietnam-cryptocurrency-adoption,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/70e04f436e45a1fd88aaab87fb1ae963ec4687c2-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411715,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfK3F,1666720377,What Are Generative Art NFTs?,"Generative art is a distinct form of art that often uses autonomous systems or algorithms to randomly generate content.  According to Tate Modern, the practice has roots in the Dada art movement and was largely pioneered by abstract painter Harold Cohen, who was among the first to use computer-controlled robots to generate paintings in the late 1960s. More recently, it has gained popularity among collectors and creators of non-fungible tokens (NFT).  While generative art is an umbrella term that encompasses many types of styles and mediums, there are common characteristics that have come to define the genre, including the repetition of patterns, shapes, colors and motifs; the randomness of composition; the use of an algorithm to generate images; and the use common use of geometric patterns and shapes.  Put simply, an artist will input a set of rules (for example, a range of colors and patterns) against a number of iterations and randomness. The artist then lets the computer generate the artwork within this framework.  While the art style has been around for several decades, it has recently gained popularity as a tool for creating non-fungible token artwork. In 2014, digital artist Kevin McCoy minted what is considered to be the first known NFT, titled “Quantum,” which used code to create an abstract image that was registered on an early blockchain network.  A number of similar experiments soon followed, including Autoglyphs by Larva Labs, which has been hailed as the first on-chain generative art project built on Ethereum. Today, some generative art NFT projects make use of a blockchain’s smart contract to execute randomized, computer-driven code when certain conditions are met, generating a unique piece of art for the NFT holder once minted.  What software is used to create generative art?  As the movement has grown over several decades, so has the list of tutorials, tools and resources that are used by new creators and collectors in the NFT space.  Although the overall process depends on the complexity and functionality of the concept, here are several popular tools used by generative art creators:  openFrameworks – An open-source C++ toolkit for generative and algorithmic art  Canvas-sketch – A javascript framework for generative artwork  C4 – An open-source iOS framework.  Unity – A cross-platform game engine that can be used for creative coding  Cinder – An open-source, cross-platform C++ library for creative coding  While most programming languages can be used to create generative art, many artists prefer to use JavaScript and its p5.js creative coding library. Online communities have also sprung up to discuss additional tools that can be added to any generative art toolbox.  Beyond coding, there are also popular resources that use artificial intelligence to help generate art, including:  Dall•E – An AI image generator created by OpenAI that uses text prompts to generate images  Midjourney – A self-funded independent research lab that allows people to create images from text-based descriptions  Additionally, Async Art has become a popular tool for artists or musicians looking to create generative art on the Ethereum blockchain without the use of code. The tool allows NFT creators to upload their assets, set rarity percentages and create an entire generative NFT collection, all in one place.  Notable generative artists and collections:  Autoglyphs  Released in 2019 by CryptoPunks creator Larva Labs, Autoglyphs are “an experiment in generative art,” each created by code running on the Ethereum blockchain. Anyone could create a glyph by donating a “creation fee” of 2 ETH (about $35 at the time) to Larva Labs’ chosen charity 350.org. The project capped the number of NFTs at 512, shutting down the generator forever. Autoglyphs have also been made into generative music.  Tyler Hobbs  Tyler Hobbs is a visual artist from Austin, Texas, who develops and programs custom algorithms that are used to generate visual imagery. He is known for his algorithmically generated Fidenza collection, which produced “unpredictable, organic curves,” with rarity determined by the mix of different-sized elements. He recently released QQL, a collaborative project with Dandelion Wist, the co-founder of generative art platform Archipelago. While anyone can play around with the QQL algorithm, only holders of the mint pass, which sold out on Sept. 28, can turn the artwork into an official NFT in the QQL collection.  Lost Poets  Created by the enigmatic persona behind Sotheby’s “The Fungible” collection, Lost Poets is both an NFT collectible and strategy game by digital artist Pak. The collection includes 65,536 obtainable NFTs and 1,024 Origin NFTs. Further details can be found in the project’s cryptic roadmap. According to the project's website, each NFT is not made up of modular pieces but was created by an AI specifically designed for the project.  Chromie Squiggles  Created by Erick Calderon, aka Snowfro, as the genesis project of the on-chain Art Blocks platform, Chromie Squiggles are unique, randomly generated squiggles of colors in nine different style schemes.  Ringers  Created by artist Dmitri Cherniak and generated from a variety of combinations using Javascript, Ringers are a set of 1,000 unique rings based on different combinations of “strings and pegs.”  Robbie Barrat  Robbie Barrat is an artist and graphic designer who works with artificial intelligence. He is known for his use of generative adversarial network (GAN) machine learning models.  Matt Kane  As a self-taught programmer, Matt Kane gained recognition in September 2020 with his Async Art piece “Right Place, Right Time” that sold for 262 ETH (approx. $100,800) in September 2020. His most recent collection, Gazers, on ArtBlocks is a series of 1,000 NFTs based on the cycles of the moon, which evolves over time.  Matt DesLauriers  Matt DesLauriers is a Canadian artist and coder. His long-form generative art project titled Meridian contains an algorithm that creates stratified landforms using “hundreds of thousands of small strokes of color.”  Where can I buy generative NFT art?  Most generative art projects can be bought and sold on popular NFT platforms including OpenSea and Rarible, although specialized generative art platforms have recently sprung up, including:  Art Blocks – Launched in November 2020 by Snowfro, the Ethereum-centric marketplace has established a reputation as one of the premier platforms for generative art.  Fxhash – The open platform is used to create and collect generative NFTs on the Tezos blockchain.  Gen.Art – The fully on-chain generative art platform is operated as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) with specialized drops for members.  Notable generative art auctions and sales  A number of generative art NFT projects have gained widespread recognition, especially those tied to established artists. Specialized platform Art Blocks has generated over $1.3 billion in volume on primary and secondary markets to date, according to DappRadar, highlighting the success of generative art projects.  Notable sales over the past several years include:  Fidenza #313 – In August 2021, the intricate work sold for 1,000 ETH ($3.3 million) to pseudonymous NFT collector and thought leader Punk6529.  Chromie Squiggle #3784 – The colorful squiggle sold for 750 ETH ($2.4 million) in August 2021.  Autoglyph #463 – In August 2021, the diamond-like pattern sold for 460 ETH ($1.7 million), making it the most expensive in the collection.  Ringers #109 – In October 2021, the piece sold on OpenSea for 2,100 ETH, or about $6.9 million.

42394168,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXtZT,1666718991,Is SBF Right About DeFi Regulation?,"Last week, while speaking to Politico, Sam Bankman-Fried, the moptop billionaire founder of FTX and Alameda Research, said he has significantly revised his outlays for political campaign spending. He said his previously stated plan to spend upwards of $1 billion was a “dumb quote.”  Year to date, SBF has spent about $40 million to back Democrats and Republicans running election political campaigns coast to coast. That spending so far seems to have paid off, with CNBC reporting the majority of Bankman-Fried’s political recipients have pulled ahead in primary voting. But the former Wall Street quant thinks there’s a limit on what money can buy in general elections.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  “At some point, when you've given your message to voters, there's just not a whole lot more you can do,” Bankman-Fried said in the Politico interview. “You can spend more time on it and more messaging, more money, more anything else [but] you're not accomplishing anything more.”  See also: Is Sam Bankman-Fried a Modern-Day Robber Baron? | Opinion  Much has been written about Bankman-Fried and “effective altruism,” the political theory he subscribes to where people build wealth to give away either by making targeted donations now, or through the magic of compound interest, founding well-endowed charities later in life.  I guess he reckons his cash is better spent elsewhere than on a TV ad in Scranton, Pennsylvania. But where will his money and influence go? The trouble with effective altruism is that it’s a way of thinking that allows people to rationalize any of their actions.  Bankman-Fried’s political pragmatism was also on display in his recently published crypto-regulatory manifesto “Possible Digital Asset Industry Standards.” The blog, what SBF called “an industry norms manual,” outlined a path for crypto industry self-regulation. Somewhat surprisingly, SBF’s industry prescriptions were widely panned.  It covered seven areas where crypto might write rules for itself while it waits for clearer regulations from above. Some are dead simple: more disclosures around crypto advertising, regular audits for cash-backed stablecoins and a three-step checklist for crypto exchanges determining whether a token they want to list is a security.  Others show how crypto has rubbed off on SBF: He wants a standard where hackers are guaranteed 5% of the bounty if they exploit a protocol – assuming they give the rest back. (That could incentivize more ethical hacking, one of the ways code enthusiasts think the industry literally evolves.)  But SBF ran into trouble on social media when writing about decentralized finance (DeFi). He put forward a “suitability test” that would restrict access to crypto, sort of like qualified investor rules based on net worth and other factors in the traditional market. This flies in the face of crypto’s reigning open-source ethos: equal access for all.  He also initially proposed a licensing system for websites that interact with DeFi and other crypto protocols, and an automatic blacklist to keep sanctioned players from using centralized services. Adam Cochran of Synthetix and Yearn Finance called the rules “a moat that lets centralized entities control at least part of the flow into DeFi.”  In response to the draft, many noted that SBF seemed less concerned with the freedoms DeFi provides than the revenue centralized firms can milk from the industry. Industry gossip site Rekt, which wrote that he was “positioning himself as the U.S. government-approved gatekeeper” to crypto, and elsewhere was compared to a drug kingpin.  The most cogent arguments came from Bitcoin OG and ShapeShift founder Erik Vorhees, who noted the self-enforced rules and blacklists would only serve established exchanges that could afford to pay for compliance. “You can advocate Effective Altruism, or you can advocate banning 80 million innocent Iranians from the future of global finance,” Voorhees tweeted. “You can't do both.”  SBF took the criticism in stride, reworked parts of his draft and wrote a long Twitter thread addressing particular concerns from a number of critics. The heart of the debate, however, cannot be ironed over. SBF is a realist who sees regulation coming, and wants a hand in shaping it.  This will always offend the ideologically driven crypto advocates, who see crypto itself as a means of bettering the world. For his part, SBF has never fully embraced the crypto mindset – and he’s been on recording saying as much. For him, crypto is a means to an end: building wealth so those funds can be redirected. (Remember the DeFi infinite “ box” fiasco?)  See also: Crypto Is a Luxury Good | Opinion  Although there were still criticisms of the toned-down draft, SBF clarified that he was talking about centralized on-ramps into crypto, not self-executing protocols. “It is not making claims about what DeFi devs, smart contracts, and validators must do,” Bankman-Fried wrote. “It’s looking to eventually establish guidelines about how e.g., FTX’s platform – or Fidelity's – could interface with DeFi contracts.”  The debate over whether crypto should capitulate and erect barriers to entry in the name of protecting the uninformed is really only getting started. Concessions have and will continue to be made, but at the end of the day it doesn’t matter if you’re a pragmatist or ideologue as long as the code functions. (That’s part of, but not the entire reason, why BitBoy’s Alex Jones-style rant about SBF selling out to “suits … with deep pockets” is ridiculous.)  Responding to his critics, SBF noted the industry needs to keep peer-to-peer transfers and blockchain validation censorship resistant. This has little to do with whether websites or front-ends block users, or if DeFi applications follow U.S. Treasury Department sanctions. The question is, where do you want to put in the effort? Where does it really matter?

42420932,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtvrR,1666716739,Stablecoins: A New Key to Success in the Current Crypto Market,"You don’t need me to tell you that crypto is way down from the dizzying $3 trillion total market cap set in November 2021. The crypto space has contracted significantly over the past year, to put it lightly.  Some are calling it another “crypto winter” – a prolonged bear market that the blockchain world has seen several times before. Market actors bemoan this fact of life, but winter is a metaphorical chance for rebirth and renewal.  Daniel Cawrey, the author of O'Reilly Media's “Mastering Blockchain,” has been a contributor to CoinDesk since 2013. This feature is part of CoinDesk's ""Trading Week.""  In this frigid cycle it seems the stablecoin sector, and U.S. dollar coin (USDC) in particular, is emerging as something real, tangible and useful. These fiat-pegged assets are filling a role cryptocurrencies have always needed for long-term success – stability, for traders and new entrants alike.  Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to some kind of (relatively) stable asset. They are not free floating like bitcoin and ether. But because stablecoins are still based on cryptography and blockchain, they provide an alternative design space to traditional banking systems.  In theory, a stablecoin could be based on any relatively stable asset – like gold. But the most popular stablecoins are tied to the U.S. dollar.  Also part of Trading Week: Jeff Wilser - A Day in the Life of a Crypto Trade  The demand for stablecoins originally came from the lack of actual dollars in the crypto ecosystem, according to Circle Vice President of Product Joao Reginatto.  “One hundred percent of the utility of [stablecoins] is around on- and off-ramps into crypto capital markets,” said Reginatto, who was a part of the company’s efforts to launch USDC in 2018. “Four years ago … there was this huge demand from traders all around the world to get access to a good dollar form factor.”  USDC, and other stablecoins, “rode that wave,” Reginatto said. Today, after the emergence of a number of novel blockchain subsectors, the current pulling capital into stablecoins has only grown stronger. Decentralized finance (DeFi) is one example – a sea to crypto’s ocean.  Also part of Trading Week: Noelle Acheson - Why Trading Is Essential for Crypto  The emergence of lenders and exchanges using smart contracts, including Compound and Uniswap, needed some kind of stable asset to properly function. Stablecoins, and USDC in particular, are used to pair trades on decentralized exchanges, as both collateral and loaned capital on lending platforms and even as ballast for other, more experimental stablecoins like Maker’s DAI.  “The first time that we started seeing us occupying a leadership position was in DeFi,” Reginatto said, referring to the long-standing battle with Tether’s USDT stablecoin for market dominance.  The significant growth of DeFi beginning in mid-2020 led traders down a new path towards permissionless financial activities. An entire ecosystem has developed around trading, swapping and lending by using blockchain and smart contracts – largely bypassing centralized exchanges entirely. None of this would really be possible or profitable without stablecoins.  Stability in hard times  So where do things go from here? Well, crypto is finding stability in hard times. Bitcoin has been less volatile than the stock market, of late. That wasn’t always the case during bear markets – and it’s entirely possible the billions upon billions of dollars that have flowed into stablecoins are acting as a store of value this time around.  And while USDT, USDC and DAI are off their peaks set in 2021, Reginatto notes that the stablecoin market hasn’t deflated as much as crypto has overall. This paradigm may be helping bellwether assets like bitcoin fare better than in prior crypto downturns.  Also part of Trading Week: Marc Hochstein - The Art of Trading Without Trading  “Early this year [stablecoins] contracted by about $50 billion as a sector, which was around a 25% contraction,” he said, comparing it to the 80% drop seen in broader crypto capital markets. “It just shows that where there is utility, there is stickiness.”  This stickiness is a sign that stablecoins could lead crypto market growth when things rebound. That, of course, depends on continued adoption and innovation, which doesn’t seem to have slowed just yet. USDC, for example, is being tested out by payments companies such as Visa and Mastercard, allowing users to settle globally in the dollar.  And it’s not like dollar demand is slowing during this post-COVID-19, stagflationary era. No matter what you think of U.S. dollar hegemony, USD demand is surging across the global south and even the European Union. The difference with stablecoins, compared with other dollar proxies printed by credit companies and banks, is that these systems are accessible to anyone with an internet connection.  Or, as Reginatto put it, stablecoins are “neutral pieces of infrastructure” that can be plugged into any number of crypto and non-crypto applications.  There’s long been talk of crypto being “programmable money” or “money Legos,” the idea that with the right technical infrastructure software can stack on top of itself and build entirely novel programs. The concept has been rocked by crypto notorious volatility, but finally has a stable base on which to stand.  Remember, stablecoin came out of demand from traders and speculation. But sometimes, speculation is innovation.  “Everybody needs a dollar. The use cases are almost infinite,” Reginatto said.",POSITIVE,USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | USDC,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/10/25/stablecoins-crypto-market-success,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/595c7db1eee6bbe8b1c1c93ceb85d4161fc03b5a-2400x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42415318,StAfe08axvsa87cUIBd4qe,1666716560,Reddit NFTs Challenge Bored Apes on OpenSea With Trade Surge,"Reddit users are pumping the platform’s Polygon-based NFT collections, with cumulative sales volumes of the avatar collectibles topping $6.5 million on Tuesday.  According to data from secondary non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace OpenSea, Reddit NFT collections edged out popular blue chip projects over the past several hours. Spooky Season, a series of collectible avatars created by Reddit user poieeeyee, currently has a trading volume of 538 ETH (approx. $760,000) – putting it just behind the reigning NFT collection Bored Ape Yacht Club at 642 ETH (approx. $906,000). According to OpenSea, the Spooky Season collection experienced a 121% increase over the past 24 hours.  Other Reddit projects, including The Senses x Reddit and Foustlings x Reddit avatar collections, also slid into top 10 slots as of Tuesday morning, joining the ranks of Ringers by Dmitri Cherniak and Chromie Squiggles.  According to data from blockchain data platform Dune analytics, Reddit NFTs have grossed over $6.5 million in total sales volume to date.  Reddit opened its NFT marketplace in July, releasing Polygon-based profile picture (PFP) avatars based on the social network’s logo, Snoo. Last week, the platform reported that users had opened 2.5 million wallets within the marketplace since its release.  User Umbra1661, who owns dozens of Reddit NFTs, told CoinDesk that the surging interest in Reddit NFTs can be attributed to the “huge power of Reddit” in engaging its community. “I do believe in the success of the project and see … possibility for growth due to the huge power of Reddit. But I just like the art as well!”  Notable Ape collector Franklinisbored said that seasoned collectors might be flocking to purchase Reddit NFTs due to their widespread appeal and accessibility. “I think whales are liking Reddit [NFTs] just because of how easy and successful they have brought in a massive group of newcomers to NFTs. So it's a show of support and confidence in their execution.”  User TheRedditAvatarWhale, who claims to have spent $50,000 on Reddit avatars, wrote in a Reddit post on Tuesday that the appeal of collecting Reddit NFTs is how they “simplify” the process of collecting NFTs for a more mainstream audience. “There is a steep learning curve to traditional NFTs that acts as a barrier to entry.” In addition, the user also touted their long-term utility and the reputation of Reddit as a trusted platform.  For some, the surge in Reddit NFTs has reaffirmed the long-held belief that PFPs are the ultimate NFT use case, even for the non-crypto native. For all the innovation the space has seen in the last two years, its original appeal – artwork as a form of digital identity – remains strong.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TRADING,"Cam Thompson, Eli Tan, Rosie Perper",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2022/10/25/reddit-nfts-challenge-bored-apes-on-opensea-with-trade-surge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/88e95bb4113969655d27edb9b65f40cbc7460e43-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394176,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvY2v3,1666715779,Anyone Can Start a Hedge Fund: How On-Chain Credit Changes the Crypto Economy,"There is one thing you can’t do with lending in decentralized finance (DeFi). You can’t borrow more than you can stake. With a few minor and heavily asterisked exceptions, there are no on-chain credit cards, no mortgages, no unsecured loans and no commercial paper in crypto.  James McGirk is a senior writer at Spectral Finance and the co-founder of Lonely ROCKS. This article is part of CoinDesk's Trading Week.  Decentralized finance uses blockchain technologies and smart contracts to gradually replace traditional finance functions. Think of it as a stack of financial pancakes.  Bitcoin created a store of value and a peer-to-peer network capable of shuffling billions of dollars worth of value between accounts in a few minutes. That's the bottom layer. Then there are smart contracts, built on blockchains like Ethereum and Solana, that automate other financial activities.  Read More: 9 Survival Tips for Crypto Winter  Liquidity pools replace money market accounts, supplying coins and tokens for a smooth financial flow between distributed agents.  Piled on top of those are DeFi lenders. Aave and Compound lend and borrow crypto. Their loans are as composable as anything software related. Companies like Alchemy.fi allow you to craft debt derivatives of mind-boggling complexity. You can even borrow hundreds of millions and pay it back within a single transaction to create arbitrage opportunities. Careful with that last one.  The next cake on the griddle will be creditworthiness assessment, i.e., what Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin and company are calling Web3’s “reputation layer,” the infrastructure to bring trust into a trustless environment.  A number of companies, including my employer, Spectral Finance, are cooking up a solution: a credit score based on publicly available blockchain transaction data.  On-chain credit scores would allow lenders to offer different tranches of interest. If you’re a risk-sensitive trader and able to prove it with an excellent on-chain credit score, you’d be able to borrow from a DeFi lender without paying as much interest as your peers.  Eventually, as undercollateralized loans come online, you would be able to borrow and trade from decentralized exchanges (DEX) and lenders without staking your own funds. Better yet, you’d be able to generate credit scores representing entire communities, letting you build a hedge fund with your buddies or borrow funds to build a block of apartments. Or you could always rent your score out.  Building economies  As unsavory as debt can occasionally be for a consumer, it accounts for a huge portion of the real economy. Lending allows people without substantial savings to participate in the real estate market. It allows consumers to buy and use household appliances, cars or go to school. Manufacturing relies on credit to secure raw materials, governments issue bonds to fund projects, small businesses use it to buy inventory.  On a macro level, lending allows capital efficiency. It's like a liquidity pool, allowing different sectors of the economy to keep spinning at maximum efficiency.  TradFi has amassed huge databases of consumer activity and created sophisticated algorithms to sift through this information going back decades to model and assess customer risk.  DeFi uses trustless transactions on the blockchain. Trades between pseudonymous agents using DeFi applications are difficult to track, and that makes risk assessment and asset recovery nearly impossible for on-chain debt markets.  DeFi lenders ignored the problem in the initial rush of DeFi summer, when on-chain lenders didn’t need to worry about capital efficiency. But to continue growing and capturing evermore market share from traditional lenders, DeFi lenders need to accurately price interest according to risk, and eventually offer undercollateralized loans.  One solution would be bringing FICO scores on-chain, using a kind of credit oracle. But connecting off-chain identities to on-chain ones could create a surveillance nightmare. As an aside, this is another reason why central bank digital currencies (CBDC) aren't a fabulous direction for us to collectively turn.  DeFi data  DeFi has a chance to refashion the world's credit assessment infrastructure. The current one is a black box run by a handful of companies or government agencies (depending on which country you live in).  Read More: 15 Ways to Stay Sane While Trading Crypto  Historically, entire demographic categories have been excluded from credit. Data capture is dominated by a few companies and is always on by default, so there’s no way to opt out, and correcting errors can be arbitrary and time-consuming, as anyone who's ever dealt with a credit report error can attest.  Ethereum transactions are publicly available. With five years of DeFi transactions to review, there’s just enough data available for sophisticated machine-learning models to make predictions.  Ideally, those models would be decentralized and transparent to the public. Consumers should be able to opt in and create a credit score on demand.

42415323,StAfe08axvsa87cUIBd4ys,1666712854,"Compound Pauses YFI, ZRX, BAT and MKR Supply to Protect Against Potential Exploits","Decentralized finance (DeFi) application Compound has paused the supply of four prominent tokens to protect users against a potential market manipulation attack – a new type of exploit that has seen over $100 million in stolen funds this month alone.  Tokens 0x (ZRX), yearn finance (YFI), basic attention token (BAT) and maker (MKR) will no longer be lent to users on Compound v2, the protocol’s latest version.  “An oracle manipulation-based attack analogous to the one that cost Mango Markets $117 [million] is much less likely to occur on Compound due to collateral assets having much deeper liquidity than MNGO and Compound requiring loans to be over-collateralized,” Paul Lei, a risk manager at modeling tool Gauntlet, wrote in the proposal on Tuesday.  “However, out of an abundance of caution, we propose pausing supply for the above assets, given their relative liquidity profiles,” Lei added.  The move came after a proposal floated by Compound’s governance community was passed Tuesday morning with over 99% of all voters in favor, with some 554,000 COMP staked to vote. Crypto data provider Gauntlet was the biggest voter, with some 126,000 COMP staked as votes, followed by Compound founder Robert Leshner, who staked some 70,000 COMP.  The proposal, floated initially in September, flagged low liquidity for the four tokens on Compound as a potential attack vector for market manipulation exploits.  Developers wrote at the time that attackers could manipulate lending markets on Compound to be able to illicitly borrow funds in excess of their holdings. They also flagged a more sophisticated strategy that would exploit the pricing difference on two assets that use different oracles, or third-party services that fetch data from outside a blockchain to within.  Market manipulations: The new crypto exploit strategy  Market manipulation led to a $100 million exploit on Solana-based trading and lending protocol Mango Markets earlier this month. The exploit helped bring more attention to the September proposal, which initially failed to garner much attention.  Mango, like other decentralized exchanges (DEX), relied on smart contracts to match trades between decentralized finance (DeFi) users. This is key to understanding how such exploits take place: Smart contracts are wholly decentralized and are not overseen by a centralized party – which means a rogue trader can deploy enough money to exploit loopholes in any protocol without the risk of anyone stepping in to stop the attack before it takes place.  In such exploits, rogue traders use initial funding to buy up a relatively illiquid spot token, which often leads to the prices of that token shooting up in a very short time span.  As spot prices increase, the rogue trader then uses the artificially inflated tokens as collateral to quickly borrow other tokens – with the motive of eventually draining all funds from the attacked protocol.  It’s important to note that the above manipulation strategy won't work on two centralized exchanges, because a trader placing high bids on one venue would mean prices automatically move higher on that exchange and other exchanges immediately raise the price of assets on their own systems – meaning the strategy is unlikely to net any profits.",NEUTRAL,BAT | MKR | YFI | ZRX,BAT | MARKET | MKR | YFI | ZRX,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/10/25/compound-pauses-yfi-zrx-bat-and-mkr-supply-to-protect-against-potential-exploits,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a72973e81a9cfd0f594cba226deae0d7eb58f6a8-3888x2916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42413280,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8HrE,1666711888,UK Lawmakers Vote to Recognize Crypto as Regulated Financial Activity,"Lawmakers in the U.K. voted in favor of recognizing crypto assets under regulated financial activities in the country on Tuesday.  The House of Commons, the Parliament's lower house, met on Tuesday for a line-by-line reading of the proposed Financial Services and Markets Bill, which broadly covers the U.K.'s post-Brexit economic strategy. The lawmakers considered a list of proposed amendments to the bill, including one put forward by parliamentarian Andrew Griffith to include crypto assets in the scope of regulated financial services in the country.  The draft bill already included measures to extend existing regulations to payments-focused stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to the value of other assets like the U.S. dollar or gold.  ""The substance here is to treat them [crypto] like other forms of financial assets and not to prefer them, but also to bring them within the scope of regulation for the first time,"" Griffith, the financial services and city minister, said during the parliamentary meeting before lawmakers voted largely in favor of keeping the amendment in the legislative package.  The local crypto industry, which recently welcomed the news of Rishi Sunak's appointment as the country's new Prime Minister, stands to welcome the efforts to give legal recognition to digital assets broadly. The markets bill – and by extension the stablecoin rules – was introduced during Sunak's time as finance minister in the Boris Johnson administration.  The crypto provision, which relies on the definition of ""crypto asset"" inserted by a new clause 14, ""clarifies that crypto assets could be brought within the scope of the existing provisions"" of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 relating to regulated financial activities, Griffith said. The measures could regulate crypto promotions and outlaw companies that are not authorized to operate in the country.  The inclusion of crypto in the scope of the bill will make sure the country's Treasury is equipped to respond to developments in the crypto sector quickly and deliver regulation in an ""agile"" way that is consistent with the country's broader approach to regulating the financial services sector, according to Griffith.  ""The Treasury will consult on its approach with industry and stakeholders ahead of using the powers to ensure the framework reflects the unique benefits and risks posed by crypto activities,"" Griffith said.  The rules have quite a way to go before they are passed into law, however. Next, the bill has to go through the House of Lords, the upper house of the Parliament, before the amendments are given a final consideration followed by royal approval by King Charles III.

42394175,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvY2pv,1666711281,What the MiCA Bill Could Mean for the Future of Decentralization,"On Oct. 10, the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) bill was passed, with 28 members of the European Union Parliament voting in favor. The new legislation addresses key crypto elements such as consumer protection, anti-money laundering (AML), environmental impact and business accountability.  The European Parliament is due to vote on MiCA before the year’s out, at which point the bill will become law within 12 to 18 months. Unfortunately, the proposed legislation could mean many decentralized finance (DeFi) entities are going to struggle to operate effectively in Europe.  Zac Colbert is a financial writer.  MiCA restricts European crypto companies with its hard cap and euro peg  MiCA is expected to come into effect in 2024. According to the proposed new law, only assets that are pegged to the euro and completely backed 1:1 are permitted, basically making algorithmic stablecoins and those pegged to anything else illegal.  Furthermore, the bill imposes a hard cap of 200 million euros worth of daily trading volume – a number much lower than most markets trade. It is here that MiCA restricts European crypto companies’ potential for both innovation and competition.  The EU claims MiCA will encourage adoption through regulation, yet more reliable digital assets such as stablecoins are restricted by the bill. Mathieu Hardy, from asset management app OSOM, feels there’s almost a tech-based discrimination when it comes to foreign currencies.  “There’s a cap on the amount of tokenized [U.S. dollars] which can be traded for crypto assets, but there are no caps on the amount of non-tokenized USD that can be traded for crypto assets or traditional assets. This broad discrimination of USD e-money tokens is very likely to make the operations of CASPs [Crypto Asset Service Providers] more complicated while offering little protection to monetary sovereignty.”  MiCA professes to put the consumer first, but really it’s about anti-money laundering  To say regulation will limit innovation is almost redundant now. But the pain point unique to MiCA is the way in which the bill actively shapes the crypto space in future.MiCA is supposedly written with the user in mind, but the wording and sheer amount of text focused around anti-money laundering (AML) rules is indicative of its true agenda. In terms of consumer protection, having a framework such as MiCA is great, but when consumer protection is achieved by making it so expensive to operate a crypto company in Europe that only well-established ones can do it, MiCA is hurting consumers in the long run.  “There’s very little done to ensure that operations of CASPs are technologically secure, but there are plenty of provisions around anti-money laundering and monetary sovereignty. Which feels a little out of order for an asset class that is mostly adopted by retail investors and represents around 1% of the world’s total assets,” says Mathieu.  It’s certainly not all bad news, though. MiCA does make some positive headway with Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASP). VASPs such as cryptocurrency exchanges, decentralized exchanges and over-the-counter (OTC) trading platforms will have to provide a range of protections for their customers, as well as implement protocols to monitor for insider trading.  MiCA does well to bring crypto company regulations in line with the same framework governing banks. The EU hopes that providing consumers and companies clear legal protections when interacting with these platforms will encourage a higher flow of capital into the market. Many feel regulation lends an air of legitimacy to the crypto space, so would-be investors are converted from consideration to adoption.  Truly decentralized companies will survive, but partly decentralized entities will suffer  With the speed of the market, it can be difficult to pin down accurate definitions in the world of decentralized finance, let alone a narrow set of legal rules that regulate complicated financial processes. And MiCA is guilty of this, still yet to provide specific clarification for many blockchain-based entities.  Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) that are decentralized in name only could have a short future. Numerous entities market themselves as decentralized, yet have legal persons who directly or indirectly control the organization through voting rights, tokens or smart contracts.  Arguably, organizations governed by rules embedded into the code and recorded on the blockchain don’t need managers, HR departments and the inevitable bureaucracy. The smart contracts on which they're built, and the open ledger of the blockchain, provide audit trails for the financial authorities.  Purist DAOs, as well as the established and generously backed projects, will survive. But the start-ups, low-capital companies and organizations that feign decentralization could seriously struggle in the tighter, limited landscape post-MiCA.  And that’s a real shame, because in the world of digital assets sometimes chaff can grow into wheat. Unfortunately, MiCA might cut these projects down before they’re given a chance.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING, Zac Colbert,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/10/25/what-the-mica-bill-could-mean-for-the-future-of-decentralization,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8bb33c10cb3cbdd695b9361d69afcfab387da55c-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42415182,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBYcoy,1666710681,"Bloomberg's Matt Levine Writes 40,000-Word Article on Crypto","Bloomberg Businessweek published a 40,000-word article on cryptocurrencies by the news organization's popular financial columnist Matt Levine, who – amid one of the worst downturns in the industry's 14-year history – offered praise of the good parts, critiques of the bad and dangled hope that this newfangled way of moving money and information around has staying power.  Levine is well-known as a chronicler of all things finance, which in recent years has meant a lot of writing about crypto. As a sign of just how importantly Bloomberg viewed the former investment banker and lawyer's piece, the news outlet made it the only article in this week's issue of the magazine, just the second time the 93-year-old publication has filled itself with a single story. (The previous one, in 2015, was about computer programming.)  Read more: What Is Crypto and Blockchain?  It acknowledges some of the ridiculous aspects of crypto culture. ""Many people who got into crypto early got very rich very fast and were very annoying about it. They bought Lamborghinis and islands,"" Levine wrote. And the article notes this might appear to be a strange time for such an opus, with crypto prices down substantially from their peak less than a year ago. The CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX), for instance, is languishing at around $20,000 after nearing $70,000 in November.  ""But really it's a good time to be talking about crypto,"" he wrote. ""There's a pause; there's some repose. Whatever is left in crypto is not just speculation and get-rich-quick schemes. We can think about what crypto means – divorced, a little bit, from the lines going up.""  One of Levine's big topics over the years has been the basic plumbing of finance – call it market structure or the business of trading. And there's plenty of that to discuss in crypto.  ""My goal is to convince you that crypto is interesting, that it has found some new things to say about some old problems, and that even when those things are wrong, they're wrong in illuminating ways,"" he said. ""Crypto has a pretty well-developed financial system, and I'm going to talk about it a fair bit, because it’s pretty well-developed and because I like finance.""  Much of the article explains core crypto topics and terms (usual suspects like proof-of-stake, ERC-20, etc.) in a plain English, explanatory way. It describes how offbeat aspects of crypto have bled into other areas of markets. In a section where Levine discusses the meme-stock craze that crested early last year, he said: ""One important possibility is that the first generalization of Bitcoin, that an arbitrary tradeable electronic token can become valuable just because people want it to, permanently broke everyone’s brains about all of finance.""  Levine also talks about how crypto has merged some conventional markets and economics concepts in unique ways. For instance: ""Crypto built an efficient system to make the customers of a business also its shareholders.""  An overarching theme is that modern life is powered by databases. And blockchain, the foundation of crypto, is one, too – meaning crypto may have a future.  ""If you build a financial system whose main appeal is its database, it will be well-suited to a world lived in databases,"" he wrote in the article's final paragraph. ""If the world is increasingly software and advertising and online social networking and, good Lord, the metaverse, then the crypto financial system doesn’t have to build all the way back down to the real world to be valuable. The world can come to crypto.""",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Nick Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/10/25/bloombergs-matt-levine-writes-40000-word-article-on-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6e68acc0373bae8465853828b6904d0ebdb14554-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The new capital will be used toward the commercialization of Synota’s software, including plans for a bitcoin mining-related service. Other investors in the round included Trammell Venture Partners, Rev1 Ventures, Hivemind VC, Bitcoiner Ventures and Recursive Capital, among others.  “There's certain properties that Bitcoin has, such as peer-to-peer payments and being able to have instant settlement of those payments,” Synota co-founder Austin Mitchell said during an interview with CoinDesk. “We've found a way to leverage those properties and apply them to an everyday payment for people all over the world – their gas and electric bills.”  “Our software basically has the ability for your energy meter to talk directly with your digital wallet,"" he continued. ""It’s able to process payments and settle transactions instantly.""  Synota integrates existing hardware and software products currently used by the energy industry with Bitcoin's Lightning Network. The overall idea would be for an energy company to end up with a smart network of production and consumption nodes. The network could see that higher energy production heading in one direction would require more payments to flow the other way, minimizing payment lags and cutting back-office costs.  “Bitcoin and energy are synonymous, merging over time due to positive incentives for energy producers,” said Ego Death Capital founding partner Andi Pitt in an email. “Synota intends to accelerate the integration of these two fundamental aspects of the new global financial system. “  Founded in 2022 by Mitchell and Lisa Scott, Synota will initially have a business-to-business focus on industrial users and energy companies, but the startup plans to expand to cover more types of energy transactions. Synota’s first commercial site should be up and running later this year. Pay-as-you-go transactions for bitcoin miners should become available in early 2023.

42394177,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvY30B,1666708765,Why Bitcoin Has Been Highly Correlated With Fiat,"Bitcoin is a conversation with fiat.  It isn't independent. It's contextual. It's relational. Bitcoin is contextualized by the existence of fiat, and hopefully, fiat becomes contextualized by Bitcoin.  It's like hot and cold, light and dark. Bitcoin is the absence of monetary intervention, while fiat is money optimized for and defined by monetary intervention.  Steven Lubka, a CoinDesk columnist, leads Swan Private, Swan Bitcoin's concierge service for high-net worth investors. This article is part of CoinDesk's ""Trading Week.""  Bitcoin, without fiat, is just money. Fiat, without bitcoin, is just money.  Starting with this lens we can discuss why bitcoin has been correlated to the unique macroeconomic environment we are in which has been decidedly negative for practically all assets.  You can hear it when people talk about bitcoin:  ""Wasn't bitcoin supposed to be independent of traditional markets?""  ""Wasn't bitcoin supposed to be an inflation hedge?""  For an asset which is supposed to provide an alternative to contemporary finance, why has bitcoin been so correlated to traditional markets and central bank policies?  If bitcoin is anything, it's an alternative to fiat. Call it a hedge, call it an escape hatch, call it whatever you want. It's something you can own in case the current iteration of the dominant money system fails or becomes dysfunctional (or already has).  See also: Why Trading Is Essential for Crypto | Trading Week  Thinking deeply about this, one should realize this implies a relationship between bitcoin and the current system. When the current system is engaged in reckless expansionary policies, in the debasement of the numeraire, bitcoin should become more valuable relative to whatever abused fiat currency you are measuring it against (and measuring it with).  So what happens when the inverse occurs? What happens when the hegemon contracts the money supply – when they tighten the monetary policy? What happens when liquidity disappears? What happens when growth inverts?  If bitcoin appreciates in value relative to fiats when monetary expansion takes place, it follows that it could decline in value when the fiat system tightens and contracts.  That's precisely what has happened. When the COVID-19 stimulus plans and massive quantitative easing were announced you could have bought bitcoin between $6,000 and $9,500 for over a month (even if you didn't catch the bottom).  Over the next year bitcoin outperformed every major asset class, and even today, after the precipitous drop from all-time highs, bitcoin has still outperformed the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 by a huge margin if you bought both at the beginning of the pandemic, before the expansionary monetary policies began.  Since June 2020, bitcoin went from $9,500 to today's price of $19,500 over a 100% return. In comparison, the S&P 500 went from 3,000 to 3,700, slightly over 23%. Bitcoin bought prior to the monetary expansion has outperformed other major asset classes, even today after a more than 70% decline from the highs.  Bitcoin's price rally was consistent with the direction of monetary expansion, and its collapse (along with every other asset) was consistent with the reversal of this direction of monetary expansion – a huge contraction.  The contraction wasn't limited to central banks stopping QE. It also included artificially raising interest rates, along with a collapse in other financial assets which also serve as part of the money supply (in practice if not in theory, at least).  Financial assets, equities and real estate represent most of the dollar-based liquidity that Americans own. Actually, dollars are a far smaller slice of the pie.  When the total value of U.S. financial assets declines by over $20 trillion, there is significantly less total dollar-denominated financial value sloshing around the world. What is this if not a contraction of the money supply? Paul Krugman might disagree with me on a semantics basis, but I don’t care about semantics, I care about how reality functions.  Low-interest rates, rampant money creation, and rising financial asset values (and premiums) led to bitcoin outperforming all other asset classes. Rapidly increasing interest rates, a cessation of money creation and crashing financial asset values (and premiums) led to a steep drop in bitcoin’s dollar denominated price.  Can I back up this point of view? Yes, let's look at gold. Gold is down 19% from its all-time high. This is meaningfully less than bitcoin, but it is still an example of the market's most commonly accepted “inflation hedge” declining in a macro environment with inflation at multi-decade highs and geopolitical tensions.  See also: Dollar-Cost Averaging Explained | Trading Week  The common thread is any discussion of “inflation hedges” is only relevant insofar as we use the actual and original definition of inflation – monetary expansion. The modern semantic switch to inflation representing consumer goods prices doesn’t help us here.  Rising inflation  Gold and bitcoin are both inflation hedges in this sense. They appreciate when the fiat money supply is expanded and they decline when that money supply contracts.  Consumer good price increases due to decades of malinvestment, under-investment in commodities, supply chain disruptions, and deglobalization do not constitute a boon for fixed monetary, assets that should appreciate in value as economic growth increases.  Bitcoin’s price performance in 2022 is not evidence of a failure for bitcoin or even a failure of narratives around Bitcoin when properly contextualized. It is solely evidence of rapid destruction of liquidity and profound geopolitical disruptions.  The good news for bitcoin investors is that a prolonged contraction of economic growth and of credit will eventually render the system totally insolvent. While this would be devastating, our esteemed central planners will eventually stop short of this and engage in a jubilee of monetary and fiscal support.  While anything is possible, the skillful deleveraging and austerities that would be involved in avoiding the inevitable monetary debasement appear far beyond the means or appetite of the current political apparatus. Therefore, the base case is more monetary expansion, and more debasement of fiat.

Zodia’s “proof of ownership” system cryptographically embeds the identity of an owner of a private key of a wallet, ensuring a third party can validate the key. It allows each account to be independently validated and linked back to its owner quickly, for instance in the event of an audit or even in the case of a custodian going bankrupt, the company said in an announcement on Tuesday.  For institutional clients, proving ownership of crypto assets held by a custodian is rather more involved than with self-custody – where a user can simply send a small amount of coins from an address or use MetaMask to sign messages with a private key.  Read more: Standard Chartered's Zodia to Offer Crypto Brokerage to Institutional Investors in Ireland: Report  Having a clear and demonstrable way of independently validating an account and quickly linking it back to its owner in a situation is a desirable outcome for institutional investors in the wake of ugly situations like the failure of Celsius Network.  “Coming from the traditional banking industry, we understand the risk, we understand regulation, and we also understand bankruptcy laws,” said Zodia Custody Chief Technology Officer Thierry Janaudy in an interview. “So we are able to give that extra comfort should something like that happen. The customer should be able to go to court with those proofs and prove to an external auditor how much they have on-chain at any point in time,” Janaudy added.  Zodia’s patent-pending custodial ownership system, which is now in live production, actually involves three different proofs, Janaudy explained. It comprises proof of ownership from a customer point of view, proof of management of the wallet from a crypto-asset service provider’s (CASP) point of view, and proof of authority as delegation of private key management from the customer to the CASP, he said.  “We still use the same HSMs [hardware security modules] to secure the digital assets in Zodia and everything relies on standards that are permitted cryptographic digital signatures,” Janaudy said.

42420935,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtvuX,1666706781,'A Metric for Fun': The FTX Leaderboard,"Woebegone-Fiery-Recovery. Clumsy-Empty-Headroom. Finicky-Muslim-Buyer. As of this writing, these are the top three crypto traders on the FTX Leaderboard – a profit scoreboard that has been used for benchmarking, credibility and bragging rights.  “Wow guys look im #1 on the FTX PNL leaderboard,” one trader tweeted in September, adding that “paid group coming soon.” The trader Alex Wice includes the line “Formerly FTX #2 PNL” in his Twitter bio. When the pseudonymous trader High Stakes Capital reached the top in 2020, he tweeted, “I’m the king now.”  This feature is part of CoinDesk's Trading Week.  High Stakes Capital, 40, is based in Dubai and he used to play professional poker. He began trading in 2015 with $20,000 in capital, and says his account swelled to $300 million at the peak of the bull run. He sees the FTX Leaderboard as a bit of objective scorekeeping. “It’s about credibility,” says High Stakes Capital. “A lot of traders on Twitter like to just share a chart and tweet whenever they’re right.”  Let’s say, for example, you book $10 million profit on a juicy trade. You tweet a screenshot and people call you a Trade God. But what you decline to mention is that you took five other trades, they were all dogs and they lost you a combined $20 million. The leaderboard is a more honest accounting. “I’m not obsessed with this,” says High Stakes Capital, “but there’s something nice about credibility.”  Other traders use it for motivation. “I might not have been as driven about improving my process if it [the Leaderboard] didn’t exist,” says the trader “ChadCloutman,” over Telegram. “Getting on there was a big motivating factor.” After any large profit and loss (P&L) swings in his account, he’ll check the leaderboard to see if he’s jumped up or tumbled down.  Also part of Trading Week: Jeff Wilser - A Day in the Life of a Crypto Trader  The Leaderboard can offer clues of traders’ positions. “You can look at traders on the leaderboard and see who is long and who is short,” says High Stakes Trader. This takes a bit of inference and triangulation. The Leaderboard does not explicitly provide that information, but if Trader X is #10 on the Leaderboard, then the price of bitcoin crashes and Trader X suddenly jumps up to #1, there’s a good Trader X is shorting the market.  Except they wouldn’t use the name “Trader X”; they’d more likely have a goofy alias like “Finicky-Muslim-Buyer.” Part of the Leaderboard’s charm is the wackiness of the trader names -- the current leaders include “Fussy-Stirling-Lubricant,” “Nastiest-Awry-Blubber,” and “Irregular-Blissful-Kitten.” They almost look like random words strung together … and that’s exactly what they are. “By default, the name is randomized,” explains Nishad Singh, the head of engineering at crypto exchange FTX, and who helped launch the Leaderboard in 2019. “We just take some adjectives and nouns from some bag of words and we assign you a random name.”  In the early heyday of the Leaderboard, Singh remembers that traders would reach out to customer service and beg them for a different combination of words, or to let them use another custom name. (FTX sometimes granted those requests, which is why you also see names that are not gibberish.)  The Leaderboard is often in flux, but the trader GCR, or “GiganticRebirth,” is always near the top. “I’ve been on it for pretty much the entirety of the exchange’s existence,” says GCR, who made a killing shorting the crypto market at the top of the bull run (as reported by CoinDesk’s Tracy Wang), as well as making prescient bets in the prediction markets. (Early in the 2020 primaries, the prediction markets gave Joe Biden just a 4% chance of winning the U.S. presidency after he flopped in New Hampshire and Iowa – implying 25-to-1 odds. GCR bet on Biden and he bet big.)  Also part of Trading Week: Marc Hochstein - The Art of Trading Without Trading  Because you can slingshot to the top of the Leaderboard with a highly leveraged trade, says GCR, a snapshot in time doesn’t tell the whole story. “If you track the history of the Leaderboard, it’s always new people. It’s a rotating cast of characters.” He notes that one exception, ironically, was hedge fund Three Arrows Capital – a reminder that not all the “leading” traders should be emulated.  GCR trades across multiple exchanges – FTX, Binance and decentralized protocols. And that brings us to the big limitation of the FTX Leaderboard: It only covers the P&L of FTX. It ignores the trading across other exchanges. This is a limitation that FTX itself happily acknowledges. “Suppose you got long on FTX and short on Bitmex,” says Singh. If the price of bitcoin moons or tanks, your overall profit would remain the same – but on one exchange you could be a star. Because of this limitation, says Singh, “it can’t possibly be a good holistic measurement of success.” He views it as a “metric for fun,” and clarifies that “we don’t endorse it as a super-serious thing.”  Another asterisk: Many of the “leaders” are not individual traders, but sub-accounts of massive trading firms. “If you look at the top 20, it’s mostly market makers and funds,” says GCR. ChadCloutman agrees, guessing that the “overwhelming majority” of the leaders are “subaccounts of multi-billion-dollar crypto trading firms” such as Jump, Tower, HRT and Alameda. ChadCloutman also notes that the Leaderboard excludes profits from spot trading, only showing the P&L from derivatives.  Also part of Trading Week: Noelle Acheson - Why Trading Is Essential for Crypto  One final asterisk: There are plenty of traders who don’t give the FTX Leaderboard much thought. “Honestly, I never use it,” says Adrian Zdunczyk (who recently shared his day-in-the-life with CoinDesk). Another prominent crypto trader told me, “I haven’t paid any attention to it.” Even High Stakes Capital, who once checked the Leaderboard frequently, now only looks at it “maybe once a month.”  Even FTX seems to have moved on from the Leaderboard. “This doesn’t come up that much anymore,” says FTX’s Singh. “The traffic on this page is basically zero.” He suspects that the waning attention of the page, in a sense, might signify some of the shifts in the industry. “Traders have become more sophisticated and more buttoned up,” says Singh.  The more professional traders care less about flaunting their stats, flexing and proclaiming to be “the king.” The Leaderboard now is more about nostalgia, or an emotional connection to an earlier era of trading. Ultimately, says Singh, “the crypto world has changed,” and that “the days of leaderboards like this are somewhat behind us.”  Just don’t tell that to Clumsy-Empty-Headroom or Finicky-Muslim-Buyer.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/10/25/crypto-ftx-leaderboard,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e4c8740939d14f960cd9518bdb544ee8dcb49b7c-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The odds are to the downside, but the upside looks compelling.Over the last few months, things have been pretty sleepy in the Bitcoin (BTC-USD) part of the crypto universe. Instead, all the hype has been around Ethereum (ETH-USD) and GPU mining as the former moved from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. But Bitcoin hasn&apos;t significantly shifted any of its core systems during this time. It has almost been lulled to sleep by its trading pattern in recent weeks. But what appears to be a paint-drying moment for traders is looking to turn into a major move in the coming weeks.Those who have followed my writing might recall my last technical analysis a year ago when I pointed toward higher highs as Bitcoin was trading at $54,000. Of course, my subscribers got the info while it was at $42,000 as the setup unfolded. Bitcoin touched $22 shy of $69,000 precisely one month later. This has been my tool for anticipating where Bitcoin is going in the near future and the medium term, and it has worked many times.For whatever reason, Bitcoin likes to revisit similar trading patterns and structures.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Price Point  Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) continued to trade in a tight trading range Tuesday with traders expecting prices to remain unchanged for another week as there are no potentially risky events or catalysts on the horizon.  Traders are focusing on next week’s Federal Reserve rate decision where the Fed is expected to hike by 75 basis points again. After that, traders are expecting the consolidation phase for cryptocurrencies to remain.  “Currently, I am leaning towards excluding a rally to the upside, and I expect the consolidation phase to stay,” Matteo Bottacini, a trader at Crypto Finance AG, wrote in a morning note. “I wouldn’t be surprised if we again test May/June lows for both BTC and ETH.""  Bitcoin reached lows of $18,900 in May, and ether dropped to lows of $880 in mid-June.  In traditional markets, U.S. stock futures were little changed after the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached its highest closing level in six weeks on Monday.  Bitcoin market share hits two-year high  According to data from Kaiko, bitcoin’s market share of trade volume has hit its highest level in over two years.  The share of bitcoin volume versus volume for altcoin markets aggregated across 14 centralized exchanges climbed past 50% for the first time since 2020, according to a research report by Kaiko.  “Bitcoin dominance has increased sharply since April, which suggests that sentiment has turned predominantly bearish after the collapse of Terra’s ecosystem and the wave of high-profile bankruptcies over the summer,” the report stated.

In a letter sent to almost all federal financial regulators, the lawmakers noted ""the increasing number of revolving door hires"" and asked how long individuals involved in regulating the crypto industry are barred from seeking employment in it.  Along with their fellow signatories, the two say they are concerned that crypto firms may appoint former financial regulators and government officials to add some teeth to their lobbying efforts.  ""We are concerned that the crypto revolving door risks corrupting the policymaking process and undermining the public’s trust in our financial regulators,"" the letter said.  The letter was addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Commodity Futures Trading Commission), Treasury, Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

42415178,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBYcTk,1666696421,"EU Stablecoin Caps Could Lighten or Get Tougher, French Official Warns","Controversial caps on stablecoins planned by the European Union could be lifted – or alternatively made yet stricter, a French official warned Tuesday, while an EU lawmaker said the bloc may have “overregulated” the crypto sector.  The EU’s recently agreed Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA) requires crypto service providers such as digital wallet companies to register for authorization to serve the bloc. It also imposes a tough limit on the size of crypto assets that are linked to assets other than EU currencies, which some in the industry fear could restrict the market.  While national governments don’t want private virtual money rivaling fiat currencies such as the euro, that “doesn't mean that the caps are rocket science,” Gabriel Cumenge, deputy assistant secretary at the French Ministry of the Economy, said of proposals that could see stablecoin issuers ordered to halt services inside the EU if they surpass 1 million transactions per day.  “We'll need to see how the markets develop, and maybe the threshold will need to be revised, up or down,” Cumenge said at a conference hosted by the Blockchain for Europe industry body in Brussels. Stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies that seek to maintain their value against assets such as the U.S. dollar or gold, would only pose a worry if used as a means of payment, not if they only constitute an investment, Cumenge added.  The stablecoin cap – first proposed after officials worried that Facebook’s now-abandoned cryptocurrency libra (later diem) could threaten Europe’s monetary sovereignty – was one of the most controversial elements in the closing stages of legislative talks, with lobbyists seeking to ensure that the limits wouldn’t apply to pure trading activity.  But even the lawmakers who wrote the legislation, which was finalized in September, realize they may have gone too far in clamping down on stablecoins.  “I think we possibly overregulated some of the parts” of MiCA, said Ondrej Kovarik, an EU parliamentarian for the liberal Renew Europe Group. “I think we could have been a bit more principle-based rather than prescriptive, on issues like for instance stablecoins.”  Read more: Start Regulating the Metaverse Now, Researchers Tell French Leaders",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/10/25/eu-stablecoin-caps-could-lighten-or-get-tougher-french-official-warns,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9d83fa3af98ba7e88cd3c844751adfea89e92137-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

That's the message from technical analysts studying price chart patterns to gauge an asset's future moves.  MATIC jumped over 12% to almost 90 cents last week, establishing a firm foothold above the widely tracked 200-day simple moving average (SMA), a barometer of a long-term trend, according to data sourced from charting platform TradingView. Price crossing above the 200-day SMA represents a positive shift in momentum.  The 12th-largest cryptocurrency also topped the ""Ichimoku cloud"" – a collection of lines displaying momentum and trend in one view.  Analysts consider crossovers above or below the cloud as early signs of a bullish or bearish trend change.  ""Polygon has cleared daily cloud resistance and the 200-day MA in a short-term bullish development,"" Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner at the technical analysis research firm Fairlead Strategies, said in an email.  ""The breakout reflects positive short-term momentum, which should fuel follow-through, targeting the next resistance near $1.00. If that level is cleared, the secondary resistance is near $1.31,"" Stockton added.  MATIC breaks two-month downtrend  MATIC recently broke above a trendline connecting the August and September highs, confirming a bullish breakout.  ""MATIC has made a very bullish move, getting above the downtrend since August, something that's not been seen yet in bitcoin and ether,"" Mark L. Newton, head of technical strategy at FS Insight, said in a market update published on Oct 20.  ""This is a bullish move and anything above 86 cents likely gets us up to 95 cents, if not $1.05,"" Newton added.  MATIC's convincing move above the descending trendline is in stark contrast to the dull price action in market leaders bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH). Both cryptocurrencies haven't cleared their bearish trendlines.  According to Stockton, bitcoin needs to see two consecutive daily closes (UTC) above the 50-day SMA at $19,576 to confirm a short-term bullish bias.",POSITIVE,BTC | MATIC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | MATIC | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/25/polygons-matic-token-has-1-in-sight-after-recent-bullish-breakout-chart-analysts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/29f581146fbb4790761762b823b7712756befca8-1280x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

ASIC said, however, that it wasn't always possible to exchange qoin on independent exchanges and that its promoter gave the impression that its network was growing even as the number of merchants fell.  Sarah Court, deputy chairwoman of the commission, said the case is important because it is the first time the organization is saying a crypto asset is a financial product, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. ASIC has asked a court to rule that qoin is a financial product that requires a license.

BPS Financial said it ""does not agree with the ASIC's position"" and ""will be defending the matter,"" the Sydney Morning Herald reported.  The firm didn't immediately respond to a further request for comment.  In February 2021, Blockchain Australia, the leading blockchain industry body in Australia, ejected qoin from its membership list without making it clear why.  Australia's markets watchdog has said its priority is to warn customers about the risks involved with crypto, and the government has said it will use ""token mapping"" as a framework for regulation and the start of testing a central bank digital currency, even as the industry has called for legislation.

However, from a historical perspective, this low volatility level carries a lot of risk. As Glassnode reports, BTC is trading in an incredibly small range of $869, separating the weekly low and high by just 4.6%. Glassnode looks at these bearish risks but also bullish opportunities in its new weekly report. Periods of extremely low volatility have been very rare in Bitcoin&apos;s history. Ultimately, there has either been an extremely strong move up or down. The Bear Case For The Bitcoin Price On the bear side, historically low on-chain usage reveals some parallels to 2018&apos;s bear market. The growth rate of non-zero balance addresses has stagnated since August. Transfer volume in USD has also slumped to $19.2 billion per day, below the December 2017 transfer volume peak and only slightly above the May-July 2021 lows. As Bitcoinist reported yesterday, miner capitulation is currently the biggest intra-market risk. According to Glassnode, the hash price has fallen to an all-time low of $66.5k/day per exahash deployed. With Hash Price now falling below the post 2020 halving lows, despite coin prices being ~2x, this demonstrates just how extreme the recent increase in hashrate competition has become.

""QuickSwap Lend is closing,"" the company said in a tweet. ""$220k was exploited in a flash loans attack due to a vulnerability with the Curve Oracle, which @marketxyz was using.""  Flash loans are provided by some DeFi networks and don't require a borrower to post collateral as long as the loan is paid back in the same transaction.  QuickSwap initially pinned the exploit on a vulnerability with the Market XYZ platform, which it said used faulty oracles from DeFi protocol Curve and stablecoin issuer QiDao. Oracles are services that fetch data from external sources to feed into any blockchain network. QiDao said the exploit was unrelated to its smart contracts.

Over the last 24 hours, there were over 45 million Shiba Inu tokens that were burned. That accounted for an impressive 1,860% spike in the asset&apos;s burn activity.

42415188,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBYdKo,1666685285,"Fan Tokens of Peruvian, Spanish and Brazilian National Soccer Teams Rally as FIFA World Cup Nears","The 2022 FIFA World Cup, which will be one of the world's biggest sporting spectacles this year, is less than a month away.  The event, reputed to be a net positive for the global economy, seems to have brought excitement to the so-called soccer fan tokens – cryptocurrencies that allow holders to access a variety of fan-related perks offered by soccer teams.  In the past seven days, fan tokens of the Peruvian national football team (FPFT), Spain's national team (SNFT) and Brazil's national team (BFT) have rallied 29%, 17% and 12%, respectively, according to data source CoinGecko. Fan tokens of Turkish and Argentinian teams have risen by 10% and 9%.  While each of these coins has a market value of less than $30 million, their recent performance stands out, given that industry leaders, bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), remain flat, and makes them the best-performing coins of the $354 million fan token market.  The soccer fan tokens, which are issued on blockchain-based fan rewards platforms Socios and Bitci, don't represent ownership of the national teams. The coins, however, allow holders to contribute to merchandising, participate in exclusive meet-and-greet events and earn loyalty rewards.  For instance, holders of the Peruvian Token can interact with the team's players on the Bitci FanToken Platform, receive fan rewards and digital collectibles, access locker rooms and watch the match from VIP areas.  So, the soccer fan token market is likely to become more active than ever in the coming weeks. Perhaps it will evolve as a digital proxy of sports betting, with coins associated with 'fan favorite"" teams appreciating more than others.  According to the Sporting News, Brazil and France are the two favorites among bookmakers, followed by Argentina and Spain. As noted above, the fan tokens of Brazil, Argentina and Spain have recently outperformed major coins.  The FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 will be played from Nov. 20 to Dec. 18, with 32 national teams competing across 64 matches to determine a winner.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/25/fan-tokens-of-peruvian-spanish-and-brazilian-national-football-teams-rally-as-fifa-world-cup-nears,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/43c3aa3fa6338727c6fedee57ef18ede2f960107-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42415190,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBYdVQ,1666683519,Celsius Once Solicited Donations for Ukraine. Here’s What Happened Next,"Celsius Network executives, in the throes of a bankruptcy proceeding, are accused by critics of siphoning off money and ensuring that the C-suite gets a payout before creditors. But when it comes to Celsius’ fundraising campaign for Ukraine, did the funds – intended to help victims of war – make it to the right place?  Months after Celsius’ bankruptcy filing, critics on Twitter are reexamining the digital asset lender’s efforts to solicit donations on behalf of Ukraine. They argue there’s no evidence from on-chain data that the cryptocurrency collected was ever passed along.  However, after a look at the data, it appears Celsius didn’t receive a material amount of funds from its donation drive, and what little bitcoin it did get it sent on to Ukraine.  The timeline  In the days following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February, crypto donations flowed rapidly into the war-torn country.  In less than two weeks, nearly $100 million had made its way to wallets set up by Ukraine’s Ministry of Digital Transformation. Major crypto exchanges including FTX and Binance provided directions for their users on how to donate to official wallets, and social media platforms worked hard to stamp out posts from scammers.  Celsius took a different approach. Instead of directing users to official Ukraine government-run wallets, it tweeted out addresses for wallets that it controlled, and solicited donations by way of those wallets.  “To help #Ukraine, @CelsiusNetwork is publishing addresses where you can donate BTC and ETH in a safe and controlled way,” the company tweeted.  Where the crypto went  According to Nansen’s wallet profiler tool, all ether (ETH) sent to that wallet was passed on to further wallets that Nansen says are controlled by Celsius.  A spokesperson for Ukraine’s Ministry of Digital Transformation said that she wasn’t aware of any ether donations received from Celsius.  It’s unknown whether Celsius made a cash donation via other means, such as a wire transfer, or if the cryptocurrency was passed along via an alternative not-easy-to-track crypto route or some other channel. But the matter has caused an outcry on Twitter among some crypto-focused users.  Celsius didn’t respond to a request for comment by CoinDesk sent to its press email.  Tracking Celsius’ bitcoin (BTC) wallets is a bit more complex. A representative for Chainalysis says that the provided wallet is a services wallet, and it can’t be effectively traced.  It’s difficult to trace funds through a services wallet “because the way that services store and manage funds deposited by users inherently makes further tracing inaccurate,” Chainalysis said in a blog post on the topic. “Only the exchange itself knows which deposits and withdrawals are associated with specific customers, and that information is kept in the exchange’s order books, which aren’t visible on blockchains or in analysis tools.”  As the wallet has low volume, with less than 100 total transactions, some manual analysis of on-chain data is possible, though its accuracy comes with some conditions.  One of the listed wallets appears to have donated small amounts of bitcoin to the primary Ukraine bitcoin wallet. Hashed transaction data shows that a donation of $34.59 was made on Feb. 26, along with two more donations of $11.40 and $39.31.  However, these transactions occurred before the tweet from Celsius soliciting donations went live. They could be from Celsius users already donating to the cause.  After the tweet went up, on-chain data shows that a bitcoin transaction of approximately $53 went to the Ukraine wallet from Celsius’ second BTC wallet.  How much ether did Celsius receive?  Given Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky’s Ukrainian heritage, one might assume that his intent was genuine when the company solicited donations via Twitter.  But many commenters on Crypto Twitter, ever the cynical chatter gallery, seemed to disagree, and by volume of donations, the campaign wasn’t much of a success anyway.  On-chain data shows that less than $100 in ether was sent to the wallet after the tweet went up on March 2 (as the wallet was used in Celsius' operations, most transactions involve internal transfers between Celsius' wallets).  All in all, this represented less than 1% of the incoming tokens to Celsius’ ERC-20 wallet, which is one of the wallets the company used to process its general transactions for business.  Critics of Celsius and Mashinsky have pointed to Mashinsky and other executives' eight-figure withdrawals from known Celsius wallets as proof that the executives sought to enrich themselves, or at least save their fortunes as the company’s financial situation was deteriorating.  But that may not be the case. Celsius didn’t receive a material amount of funds from its donation drive, and what little bitcoin it did get it sent on to Ukraine. The ether stayed in the wallet, but in the amount in question is the equivalent of a rounding error. The firm’s poor public image, however, and the choice to use its own wallets and not well-publicized Ukrainian wallets, encourages some conspiracy theory narratives.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | BNB,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/10/25/celsius-once-solicited-donations-for-ukraine-heres-what-happened-next,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/80a53115ce03333c04620d544a264988a0629bd4-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This would represent ARK’s first purchase of Coinbase stock since June, according to 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In August, ARK Chief Investment Officer Cathie Wood said the fund reduced its holdings in Coinbase because of an SEC probe into the crypto exchange.  Wood called the probe a “thesis risk” to Coinbase at the time and maintained that ARK would be selling 1.1 million COIN shares, which she said was “very little.”  Both Wood and ARK generally remain quite bullish on Coinbase and crypto in general. 13F filings show that ARK has 7.7 million shares of COIN, and added around 2 million shares to its holdings throughout the last year. Filings show that throughout all of ARK’s buys of COIN it has paid an estimated average price of $218.45.  During a recent appearance on Peter McCormack's ""What Bitcoin Did"" podcast, Wood said she purchased $100,000 worth of bitcoin (BTC) when it was trading at $250 and hasn’t sold since.

Bitcoin Holds Over $19K – Yet Again  By James Rubin  The economic future had a slightly rosier hue, but not enough to stir bitcoin and other major cryptos from their weeks-long roosts.  Bitcoin was recently trading above $19,300, a few ticks down from where it stood 24 hours earlier and well above the $19,000 threshold that’s served as a bottom support since mid September. Ether was recently changing hands at about $1,350, also slightly down from Sunday, same time, although as Oanda Senior Market Analyst Edward Moya noted that Ethereum has “gained more buzz” as the supply of ether has decreased.  Other major altcoins were mixed earlier Monday but tinted red later in the day as investors continued their recent risk-averse postures. LUNA and ATOM each recently fell about 4%. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures the performance of a basket of cryptocurrencies, was down 1.1% over the past 24 hours.  Investors continue to eye U.S. Federal Reserve efforts to tame inflation. They sent stocks higher for a second consecutive day, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 climbed 1.3% and 1.2%, respectively, and the Nasdaq increased 0.8%.  The earnings season continues with Apple and Google parent Alphabet among the major tech companies scheduled to report. And on Tuesday the Conference Board will release October's consumer confidence index – showing a likely decline.  In an interview with CoinDesk, GSR Markets Global Head of Product Benoit Bosc said that any lessening of the current dose of steep interest rate hikes would spur a “knee-jerk reaction.” “It will be a sharp move higher for risk assets,” Bosc said.

By Sam Reynolds  While FTX and Coinbase might have the mindshare, Binance’s $44 billion in daily volume is unchallenged by any other crypto exchange.  Binance pushes through around 53% of all crypto trades on spot and derivatives markets by trade count, and around 30% of the market’s value.  And Binance is so much more than just an exchange. It has an eponymous blockchain for which it controls most of the validators, a stablecoin to which it gives preference on its exchange (though it might not be a bad thing), a major governance entity on the Uniswap DAO and is a lender of last resort to the beleaguered crypto mining industry.  Is Binance becoming too dominant?  Certainly other exchanges have products or mandates that go beyond their core business. FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, despite commanding a smaller percentage of the daily trading volume than Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, spreads his influence far and wide with industry bailouts as the industry this year needed its version of the original J.P. Morgan. (The results have been “mixed,” as SBF said on David Rubenstein's show.)  Libertarian DNA  The crypto industry has libertarian DNA flowing through its veins. This is not a bad thing. Crypto becoming a trillion-dollar asset class has put lethargic regulators on notice that they must examine and embrace new technology instead of dismissing it and wishing it away through regulation. And there are alternative regulators to those based in the U.S. that have the competency to give institutional investors comfort (see: FTX’s endorsement of the Bahamas’ licensing regime). The establishment needed challenging.  But at the same time, monopolies tend to form in certain industries where there are economies of scale, such as the trading business. The pace of crypto mergers and acquisitions is expected to accelerate in the bear market.  Libertarians would argue that the state breaking up companies is a failure to grasp the “creative destruction” of market dynamism. Naturally, the market corrects for monopolies. Microsoft, for instance, is nowhere near the dominant force it was during the antitrust case of the late 1990s.  Within the Web2 world, regulators haven’t been very keen on antitrust lawsuits because of allegations of monopolistic behavior. Suits by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the states alleging that Meta, then Facebook, engaged in monopolistic practices have been thrown out. As a result, there have been calls to revamp antitrust laws, but it will take years for Congress to get to this.  Will the same happen in crypto? Will there be a challenger to Binance?  When Binance announced that it was killing access to three stablecoins that compete with its own, Circle wasn’t too upset. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire tweeted that USDC would emerge a winner, as it would accelerate a shift away from USDT, which is a token-non-grata in the U.S.  “While optimizing dollar liquidity on the world’s largest exchange may carry benefits, the paradigm does raise potential market conduct questions,” Circle was quoted as saying.  So there are hints of antitrust ingredients, but because USDC, a competitor to BUSD, for now, remains a beneficiary, there’s not a case to be made – yet.  But what happens when Binance puts together all the separate entities it has and does something where all its competitors get unfairly locked out of a particular market?  At that point it might be relevant to revisit the question of whether Binance has become too dominant.
