2670,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=494986,1657151995,"Bitcoin Sets Record For Worst Quarter Since 2011, What’s Next?","The second quarter of the year was dramatically bloody for Bitcoin. The coin ended Q2 down by 56% with the price dropping from $45,000 to $19,900, experiencing its worst quarter since Q3 2011. Bitcoin is now playing with its $20k level, a key zone. A Historic Decline For Bitcoin Bitcoin had a 37% decline during June. But it is not just the numbers that have been gloomy. June was also the month of the unsurprising rejection of Bitwise and Grayscale&apos;s spot-based bitcoin ETF applications -immediately followed by Grayscale&apos;s promised lawsuit-. Moreover, the effects of the Terraform Lab&apos;s UST stablecoin and Three Arrows Capital collapses seem to have turned into something contagious amongst crypto firms: another crypto lender and trading platform, Vauld, suspended all withdrawals, trading, and deposits quoting the &apos;financial challenges&apos; of current market conditions. During 2022&apos;s second quarter, Bitcoin opened at $45,000 and declined to below $20,000, managing to recover its key $20k price level just in time to close June above it. As NewsBTC reported recently, the coin &apos;needs to break above $20,500 and continue above $22,000 to clear out any potential short-term downside risk.&apos; Overall, the latest Arcane Research weekly report notes that this decline &apos;marked a historic quarter for the bitcoin price, and we have to go back 11 years to find a more brutal quarter.

42374307,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZAVb,1657151314,"Solana Labs, Multicoin Accused of Violating Securities Law by SOL Investor","A potential class-action lawsuit filed in a California federal court last week accuses key players in the Solana ecosystem of illegally profiting from SOL, the blockchain’s native token that, according to the suit, is an unregistered security.  “The cornerstone of the value of SOL securities is the sum of Solana Labs, Solana Foundation, and [Anatoly] Yakovenko’s management and implementation of the Solana blockchain,” the suit alleged. It described SOL as a highly centralized cryptocurrency that has benefited its insiders to the detriment of retail traders.  Filed by California resident Mark Young, who said he bought SOL in late summer 2021, the suit names Solana Labs, the Solana Foundation, Solana’s Anatoly Yakovenko, crypto VC giant Multicoin Capital, Multicoin’s Kyle Samani and trading desk FalconX.  A Solana spokesperson declined to comment. Multicoin and FalconX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  According to the complaint, Young alleges the way SOL was created and sold meets the three tenets of the Howey Test, a U.S. Supreme Court precedent commonly used as a barometer for whether the sale of something is a security or not.  “Purchasers who bought SOL securities have invested money or given valuable services to a common enterprise, Solana. These purchasers have a reasonable expectation of profit based upon the efforts of the promoters, Solana Labs and the Solana Foundation, to build a blockchain network that will rival Bitcoin and Ethereum and become the accepted framework for transactions on the blockchain,” the filing said, addressing the three forks of the Howey Test.  In the filing, Young pointed to several sales of the SOL token or agreements to sell the SOL token ahead of the public sale of the token.  Solana Labs filed a Form D with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (a filing saying the sale was of securities exempt from SEC registration), noting the company was selling “the future rights” to around 80 million SOL, according to the filing.  Multicoin, a major crypto venture capital firm that has invested heavily across the Solana ecosystem, “offloaded millions of dollars of SOL” onto retail after “relentlessly” promoting the token in spite of Solana blockchain’s tech issues, the suit alleged. This alleged offload passed through FalconX over-the-counter trading desks, the suit said.  Young’s law firm Roche Freedman also recently filed suit against Binance.US for allegedly misleading investors during the Terra implosion. A lawyer for Roche Freedman did not pick up the phone.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin holds above $20K; ether climbs late Wednesday.  Insights: Inaccurate data led investors to believe that crypto exchange KuCoin's holdings were smaller than expected, according to KuCoin CEO Johnny Lyu.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $20,600, up better than a percentage point. Bitcoin had plunged below the psychologically important barrier last week before a late weekend rally. Many analysts have adopted a clear-eyed view of the current crypto climate that has suffered the dual body blows of protocol fiascos and macroeconomic uncertainty. They do not see prices rising any time soon, barring an unexpected turn for the better in the ongoing battle with inflation.  ""You're seeing carnage out there,"" said David Nage, portfolio manager for asset management firm Arca, on CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program. ""You're seeing Celsius. You're seeing Voyager. You're seeing BlockFi. You're seeing a number of different headlines come in over the last few months.""  Yet, Nage also viewed positively bitcoin's ability for much of the past month to remain in its current $18,000-$20,000 range. ""Bitcoin has held steady around this trading pattern,"" he said, adding: ""We talk about digital assets as a durational effect in terms of things that are going to happen and change with society and our economic systems. Bitcoin is definitely a part of that.""  Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was recently trading at roughly $1,190, up more than 5%. Other major cryptos also traded slightly higher with STORJ rising nearly 6% at one point and RUNE climbing more than 5%. Troubled crypto lenders CEL token dropped over 8%.  Equity markets rise slightly  Cryptos tracked major equity markets as they've done far more frequently than not in recent months, with the tech-focused Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average all up, albeit ever so slightly. Investors who have been concerned about the U.S. central bank's efforts to tame inflation may have drawn some encouragement from the release of minutes of the Federal Reserve's June meeting indicating a firm commitment to its current, hawkish monetary policy. U.S. Labor Department figures released Wednesday morning showed strong hiring in May, a sign that the economy has not been cooling sufficiently to stem inflationary pressure.  Crypto industry news centered on Voyager Digital's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing Tuesday, which will allow the firm to reorganize with the intent of paying back at least some of its creditors. Voyager Digital followed by just a few days a bankruptcy filing by crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which filed for chapter 15 protection tied to an ongoing liquidation effort ordered by a court in the British Virgin Islands.  Toronto-based Voyager estimated that it had more than 100,000 creditors and somewhere between $1 billion and $10 billion in assets. The firm recorded the same range for its liabilities and faces delisting by the Toronto Stock Exchange. Crypto lender CoinLoan and crypto futures exchange CoinFLEX have limited and halted withdrawals, respectively in recent days.  'Healthy markets here'  Arca's Nage noted optimistically ""some normalization ... , some healthy markets here"" in recent funding for digital asset projects. ""If you want to call it a crypto winter, whatever you want to call it, if we looked at the venture and private side, what we're seeing is really healthy activity from the private markets,"" he said.  He added regarding the broader outlook for the industry: ""We continue to get a few more these shots to the solar plexus, sentiment will probably reach its slowest peek and then we'll probably rebound. But it's going to be a long time. From a private markets perspective, we're telling our founders, really be prepared for more than two years, 36 months actually.""  Markets  S&P 500: 3,845 +0.3%  DJIA: 31,037 +0.2%  Nasdaq: 11,361 +0.3%  Gold: $1,739 -1.44%  Insights  KuCoin Held More Bitcoin Than Initial Data Feeds Indicated, Says CEO  Contagion risks emerged in the crypto market after May’s implosion of terraUSD (UST), an algorithmic stablecoin that tracked the U.S. dollar. Three Arrows Capital, or 3AC, a prominent crypto fund, took on “heavy losses” on its UST stablecoin position, which alongside poor market conditions, contributed to the firm’s collateral requirements going topsy-turvy and several loans turning into bad debts.  The company held funds from firms that included crypto lenders Voyager, BlockFi and Celsius. These funds’ 3AC exposure has led to Voyager filing for bankruptcy, BlockFi reaching a deal for its sale to crypto exchange FTX US, and Celsius turning to investment banking giant Goldman Sachs (GS) to lead a $2 billion raise for its distressed assets.  The fallout has ignited tensions throughout the crypto community with many observers questioning prominent exchanges’ and wallets’ liquidity. KuCoin, a popular crypto exchange based in Seychelles with a large Asian presence, is among the firms swept up in the industry-wide crisis.  Crypto Twitter last week claimed KuCoin was likely insolvent, with some talking heads urging users to withdraw their funds out of the exchange. This led to outflows, with some users pointing out – wrongly, as it turned out – that KuCoin’s 14 hot wallets had drained from over $1.8 billion to just $10 million within a day. (The tweet was later corrected.)  KuCoin founder and CEO Johnny Lyu, however, explained that inaccurate data feeds and mislabeled, on-chain wallets propagated rumors last week that led to the outflows.  “Most on-chain tracking tools can't present the exact balance of exchanges because many exchange addresses are not labeled on the blockchain,” Lyu told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. “As a result, many online tracking tools, including Glassnode, miscalculated the balance of KuCoin (and maybe other exchanges too).”  Lyu said corrected data provided to Glassnode and others now accurately displays the exchange’s bitcoin holdings of between 15,000 and 20,000 bitcoins, not the few thousand the old data indicated.  Lyu added that not all exchange addresses were tagged on popular blockchain scanning tools, which also contributed to user worries.  “It's also worth noting that some KuCoin addresses are still not labeled on the blockchain, so this amount tends to be not taken into account by many statistical algorithms and tracking tools,” Lyu said.  “Due to a part of KuCoin wallets not being labeled on the blockchain, a big piece of data remains unaccounted for.”  Glassnode has not responded to CoinDesk's request for comment.

Key technical points: DCR prices have jumped by 0.63% in the last 24 hours. The long-coming resistance trendline accounts for a 70% drop in market value. The 24-hour trading volume of Decred is $1.71Million, indicating a drop of 2.71%.

The downfall reached a new 2022 low of $19.98 on June 18th, following which the coin price initiated a lateral walk.

Contrary to the price action, the MACD indicator shows a steady rise in fast and slow lines, suggesting growth in bullish momentum. This nearing a crossover above the equilibrium may attract more buyers to the market. Concerning the two retests at $21.4 support within a month, the RSI slope shows an evident divergence.

However, unlike their futures and short counterparts, the spot ETFs have not found favor in the eyes of the regulatory watchdog. And as more spot-based bitcoin ETF applications are declined by the SEC, questions have arisen about whether the market will see one anytime soon. Grayscale And Bitwise Applications Rejected Over the last month, anticipation had built up regarding spot-based Bitcoin ETF filings by both Grayscale and Bitwise. Grayscale had filed its application last year, with the SEC postponing its decision multiple times, but the firm had remained steadfast in its resolve to try to get approval for a spot bitcoin ETF. The final decision had come last week and it was indeed negative as experts had forecasted. Grayscale had received a rejection on its application but it was not the only one. Bitwise had also made a filing for a spot BTC ETF and the SEC had also put a stamp of rejection on it too. The latter had filed to convert its popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to a spot-based ETF. The fund which has $12.35 billion is the largest bitcoin trust and is looking to move to the next level.

In a Medium blog post, pseudonymous developer Shytoshi Kusama said that ""independent developers"" are crafting a decentralized stablecoin called SHI, which ""seems to avoid the issues found in other moonshots"" – a likely reference to the billion-dollar Terra/luna implosion. The team expects to share more information when SHI gets closer to its final form, and plans to launch it later in 2022, the blog post said.  TREAT, the SHIB metaverse's upcoming reward token, will be tied to the Shiba Collectible Card Game. The token will also ""help provide balance to"" Shiba Inu's stablecoin, the blog post said without describing how that would work. Developers are also reserving ""a limited supply"" of TREAT for longtime backers of the project.  Shiba inu is the second most popular dog-themed cryptocurrency after dogecoin (DOGE); it amassed an ardent following during the latest boom in crypto. It launched in 2020 August, and later launched a decentralized exchange ShibaSwap, and ecosystem tokens BONE and LEASH, with further plans to expand the meme coin into a crypto ecosystem.  As a part of the plan, developers are working on the ecosystem's own layer 2 protocol called Shibarium that would support native app deployment and development, including a gas token called BONE. The team is separately building a metaverse project with 100,000 land plots as virtual real estate. The Shiba Inu Collectible Card game, which is in the development phase, will live in Shiba's metaverse, according to the blog post.  Shiba Inu's SHIB token traded flat in the wake of the news, but surged almost 50% in a week in June amid speculations about its Shibarium protocol.

A legal advisory notice issued by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics (OGE) on Tuesday declared that the de minimis exemption – which, when applied to a security, would allow the owner of an amount below a certain threshold to work on policy related to that security – doesn’t apply to any cryptocurrency or stablecoin, even if the cryptocurrencies in question “constitute securities for purposes of the federal or state securities laws.”  The directive applies to all White House staff and the employees of all federal agencies, including the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department.

Bitcoin (BTC) leveled off to around $20,000 in Wednesday trading, down 1% from its high of $20,720 the previous day. The oldest cryptocurrency has changed hands largely in the $18,000 to $21,000 range for most of the past month as investors gauge the impact of rising inflation and macroeconomic uncertainty.  The majority of alternative currencies (altcoins) were in the green on Wednesday with Avalanche's AVAX leading the charts, up 5.5% in the last 24 hours. Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization after bitcoin, was up 0.7%.  An increasingly correlated asset  For much of its short history, bitcoin has been uncorrelated to traditional markets, which served as a desirable quality for recession-conscious investors. However, according to data from Coin Metrics, bitcoin’s correlation to U.S. equities, specifically the S&P 500, has strengthened since March 2020.  “The correlation hit a new all-time high in Q2 2022 with BTC and U.S. equities moving almost in lockstep,” Coin Metrics wrote in a newsletter. “At the same time, BTC moved increasingly against risk indices like the VIX.”  The release of the June consumer price index next week may show whether the recent hawkish monetary policies of the U.S. Federal Reserve have been effective. If prices decline and other economic indicators also continue their recent descent, investors may feel more confident that the U.S. is solving the dual problems of inflation and potentially steep economic contraction. If the CPI continues to increase, markets could be discouraged.

Voyager is next crypto lender to fall  Today’s positive crypto market movements were overshadowed by crypto lender Voyager’s filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection late Tuesday.  Voyager’s decision is part of the domino effect of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital’s liquidity problems. The Singapore-based firm filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy on Friday. In Voyager’s case, according to writer Frances Coppola, nearly 50% of total assets were from its loan book and nearly 60% of the loan book consisted of loans to Three Arrows Capital.  Crypto companies – and lenders in particular – have faced solvency issues in recent weeks, with several stopping customers from withdrawing their funds. Celsius started this trend last month, announcing in mid-June that it would suspend withdrawals. CoinLoan, CoinFLEX and Voyager itself all announced restrictions or outright halts on withdrawals in recent days, Nikhilesh De and Danny Nelson reported Wednesday.  Voyager’s VGX token plummeted to a low of 20 cents within hours of filing for bankruptcy and is now trading at around $0.21, 12% down in the last 24 hours.

Currently, the PERP coin is stable on the last trading day with flashes of green judging from the recent performance.

Accordingly, risk-averse Perpetual Protocol buyers may wait for a clear trend definition and, ideally, a follow-through above $0.83 before ramping up. Nonetheless, since PERP coin prices are still within the June 22 trade range, traders may load the dips above $0.58 or last week&apos;s lows. Their immediate targets will be $0.83 and later $1. In such a move, PERP will be bottoming up, shaking off aggressive bears. What to Expect from PERP?

42374301,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZAQZ,1657136801,‘Crypto: The Musical’ Aims for Broadway,"Crypto has already established a foothold on Wall Street – but what about the Big Apple’s most famous avenue? If Amanda Cassatt has her way, “Crypto: The Musical” could be the next show to hit Broadway.  The musical – still in the very early stages of development – will tell the story of Zoe, a woman who leaves her corporate job to join a crypto startup, “and the many absurdities, heartbreaks and triumphs she experiences along the way.”  Much like the project’s main character, the team behind “Crypto: The Musical” will face their own heartbreaks and absurdities in their bid for Broadway. Producing a musical doesn’t come cheap, so Cassatt – the CEO of Web3 marketing agency Serotonin – turned to the crypto community for help fundraising.  Cassatt set up MusicalDAO, a self-described decentralized autonomous organization that allows donors to contribute to the project’s funding in exchange for pre-sale tickets and other privileges, including naming a character or making an on-stage cameo. A minimum donation of $1,000 – paid in either stablecoins USDT or USDC – is required to join the DAO. Once the DAO reaches 1,500 individual contributors, membership will close and the project will go before Broadway investors to get the real cash it needs to debut.  Cassatt was reluctant to share with CoinDesk the number of people who have contributed funds, but said the reception to the project, which debuted at CoinDesk’s Consensus festival in Austin, Texas, last month, has been “great” so far.  On-chain data paints a slightly different picture. According to Etherscan, the designated donation address cryptothemusical.eth had received a singular $1,000 stablecoin contribution by press time.  A spokesperson for the project told CoinDesk that while the address was correct, the creative team is in no hurry to raise money.  “It’s early days for this project. It typically takes years to put together Broadway musicals,” the spokesperson told CoinDesk. “We’re starting to see a community gather. Web3 is all about experimentation, community building, and creating new models to shake up how things are traditionally done, and that’s what [the show] is all about.”  The online crypto community’s tepid response to the project isn’t entirely surprising. Cassatt acknowledges the “strange bedfellows juxtaposition” of a crypto-themed musical. (“I think that’s what makes it funny,” she told CoinDesk.) Strange bedfellows or not, “Crypto: The Musical” wouldn’t be crypto’s first foray into the world of Broadway: the longtime musical “Dear Evan Hansen” partnered with Roblox earlier this year to release a non-fungible token (NFT) collection benefitting a children’s mental health charity.  It doesn’t help the project’s launch has coincided with the onslaught of crypto winter: Major players in the crypto space are declaring bankruptcy and dropping like flies, and layoffs are accelerating across the industry.  Cassatt is hopeful her show can thrive in the bear market anyway.  “I think in this market, selling things to audiences at a million-dollar price point isn’t always the right thing, but I think reaching people where they are and bringing in more supporters at a grassroots level … makes a lot of sense,” Cassatt told CoinDesk.  “To do something entertaining and interesting and off-the-beaten path – I think this is the kind of lightness that the community needs and wants during this time,” she said.  ‘Schoolhouse Rock’ for Web3?  The project’s executive producers, composer Daniel Mertzlufft and Macy Schmidt, were part of the team behind the delirious COVID-19 pandemic spectacle, “Ratatouille: The TikTok Musical.” Cassatt’s company, Serotonin, will produce “Crypto: The Musical” alongside two Tony Award-winning producers.  Crypto-themed songs, including one about the Howey Test – a legal metric for determining what qualifies as a security – and another about NFTs, called “Right Click Save” will provide the soundtrack for “Crypto: The Musical.” Even the project’s ostensibly non-crypto songs are dripping with crypto references; in a love song sung by the main character, she references being “tethered to a stable man.”  But Mertzlufft told CoinDesk that while he wants the project’s songs to showcase the team’s knowledge, he’s wary of turning it into the “‘Schoolhouse Rock’ of Web3.”  “There’s lots of little things in there where if you know, you know and, if not, it’s just a song,” Mertzlufft said. “Our character, Zoe, is also not a Web3 person at the beginning of the show, so an audience member who is also not a Web3 person learns along with her. The goal is that you never feel like you’re being forced to learn.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/07/06/crypto-the-musical-aims-for-broadway,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/956478c94c183280fbdbfa60ff09f5341183538a-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

That compares with a recent valuation of $4.8B. Of course, there&apos;s no guarantee that FTX US will recoup its investment. In the meantime, &apos;we&apos;re starting to get a few more companies reaching out to us,&apos; SBF told Reuters. While FTX has $2B in cash to execute a deal, &apos;it does get increasingly expensive with each one of these,&apos; he added. &apos;If all that mattered was one single event, we could get above a couple billion,&apos; though that&apos;s not SBF&apos;s preferred route, as quoted by Reuters.

He joined the Algorand blockchain project as head of business development and capital markets.  Also announcing a new job this week in crypto, Puja Samuel, formerly a head of ideation and digitization at JPMorgan based in New York City, joins Digital Currency Group (CoinDesk’s parent company) as head of corporate development.  Already this week, CoinDesk reported that former JPMorgan banker Samir Shah had left the bank to become chief operating officer at cryptocurrency-focused investment firm Pantera Capital.  Wragge’s arrival at Algorand was welcomed with a blog post, stating that he will report to Algorand Foundation CEO Staci Warden, and will lead initiatives in both traditional capital markets as well as decentralized finance (DeFi). Wragge will also chair the foundation’s investment committee.  “Coming from a leading global investment bank, I understand the uncompromising performance requirements for a layer 1 blockchain to compete against and improve upon many aspects of traditional finance,” Wragge said in the post.  Commenting on her new role at DCG, Samuel said: “I am excited to help build out new strategic partnerships alongside an energized team that is driving change across the financial system.”  It should be mentioned that none of the people worked within Onyx, JPMorgan’s blockchain and digital assets division.

ALGO bulls must close above $0.32 and the middle BB for buy trend definition. Past Performance of Algorand Trading at $0.308, Algorand prices are stable in the past 24 hours and remain bearish at spot rates. Although there are flashes of strength, the failure of ALGO crypto bulls to push higher is the primary obstacle for optimists. Still, with Algorand token prices above $0.29, buyers stand a chance. Algorand Technical Analysis The ALGO coin technical analysis in the daily chart shows that prices are stable. The immediate support level is at last week&apos;s lows at $0.29. On the upper end, Algorand prices have primary resistance at $0.32—this week&apos;s highs—and $0.36. A high volume break above $0.32 may see ALGO token prices rise above the dynamic resistance line, the middle BB, triggering demand. In that case, traders may load the dips, targeting $0.36 in a bullish breakout formation. Conversely, if there are unexpected losses forcing ALGO below $0.29, the coin may slump to print new 2022 lows at $0.27 or worse. What to Expect from ALGO? The path of still resistance is southwards, despite the recent stabilization as per the ALGO technical analysis in the daily chart.

In the hours since the testnet merge happened, no significant glitches have been reported.  The Sepolia merge was a two-step process. Ethereum announced that first the operators needed to update their consensus layer and execution layer clients together.

42421507,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoWBp,1657126836,Nic Carter vs. The Bitcoin Maximalists,"Most Crypto Twitter fights are bouts of sound and fury, signifying nothing but the allure of tribalism and the varieties of mental illness in the human animal. But sometimes a Twitter fight is the tip of a much deeper and more substantive iceberg.  We witnessed one of the substantive fights over the past week, as stalwart crypto analyst and venture investor (and CoinDesk columnist) Nic Carter clashed with so-called bitcoin maximalists. Carter thinks the fight might signal the end of bitcoin (BTC) maximalism as a respectable ideology, and I think he might be right. It illustrates, above all, an increasingly vapid anti-intellectualism and shallow performativity taking over what was once the single most powerful body of thought in crypto.  The fight began when Carter and his fund, Castle Island Ventures, announced an equity investment in a start-up called Dynamic. Dynamic is building a wallet-based platform with decentralized identity features, one of the most interesting applications of Web3 technology.  The problem is that Dynamic is multichain. For self-declared bitcoin maximalists, this amounts to heresy. That’s almost literal, as we’ll get into, because bitcoin maximalism possesses many features of a religion – and maxis were under the impression Carter was one of them. Turns out, not so much: “From the very start, I’ve been a pluralist when it comes to blockchains,” he laid out in a post responding to his critics.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  What is bitcoin maximalism?  Bitcoin maximalism is a lot of things. On the surface, as Carter outlined in an appearance on the ”Bankless” podcast Tuesday, it’s the belief that owning, touching or in any way supporting any crypto asset other than BTC is not just a crime but also a sin, with all the hard-line religious implications of that word. Merely mentioning such an asset can count as “support.”  Carter argues convincingly that many of the maximalists who attacked him are Johnny-come-latelies who are merely a cargo cult blindly aping the vitriolic rhetoric and bullheaded stubbornness displayed by partisans in the circa 2017 “blocksize war,” when there was a real sense that changes to bitcoin were potential threats to its long-term stability.  There are real ideas behind bitcoin maximalism, and substantive reasons for adherents’ blanket hostility to altcoins, even if they’ve been watered down by today’s self-identified maximalists. Most fundamentally, maximalism holds that BTC should be the only cryptocurrency because it is the only one that’s truly decentralized. Certainly, it’s objectively true that most altcoins have been either failed experiments or outright grifts, draining money and enthusiasm from crypto as a whole to enrich feckless or corrupt founders.  Some maxis also argue the Bitcoin platform will eventually run all the same decentralized utilities we now enjoy on smart-contract platforms like Ethereum, because it will absorb innovations from other chains. (Others are skeptical of any use for a blockchain other than running the currency.) Finally, when they really get going, maximalists will argue that BTC will become a world reserve currency, displacing all filthy and fragile fiat.  I find Carter’s fight fascinating because I, like him, love bitcoin and believe that many maximalist ideas are directionally correct. I wrote an entire book, Bitcoin is Magic, about how interesting and important Bitcoin is. But also like Carter, I think the all-or-nothing nature of the extreme maximalist position discourages thinking through the real-world complexities that will inevitably face those broad predictions.  What the maxis get right  For instance, there is compelling economic logic and empirical evidence that BTC acts as a safe-haven asset for people stuck in truly hyperinflationary monetary circumstances, on the order of Turkey’s current 54% inflation rate. This safe-haven feature is established and objectively observable in the real world. Over time, BTC will become a kind of global disciplining force on fiat currencies. That is not the same, though, as believing that it will inevitably replace all global currencies.  More fundamentally, the maximalists’ most compelling point is that BTC is the most truly decentralized digital asset. This is broadly true, and ultimately what makes bitcoin fascinating – it is something like a force of nature that has emerged from the global computer network. This is why even U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler is willing to consider it, and no other crypto, a commodity – it is a protocol, not a product.  I often think of bitcoin as something like a mycelium – the invisible, underground network from which mushrooms grow. A mycelium spreads relentlessly but invisibly, finding opportunities to thrive where it can. Bitcoin is like that: universal and unstoppable, yes, but more tailored for some situations and applications than others.  If maximalism has become a refusal to think through the material subtleties of bitcoin’s actual usefulness, it has become an intellectual dead end. As Carter points out, a scad of smart bitcoiners have already figured that out and headed for the doors. That includes longtimers like Udi Wertheimer, Eric Wall and pseudonymous analyst Hasu, all of whom were at least loosely in the “bitcoiner” bucket until their curiosity and open-mindedness earned them the maximalists’ ire.  Who’s left – Tom Brady and Saifedean Ammous? As Oscar Wilde said of Niagara Falls, it would be more impressive if it flowed in the other direction.  Voodoo economics  Carter also highlights another bizarre belief of contemporary maximalists: that BTC’s price in dollars can be confidently predicted. I’ve never really bothered to dig into the “stock to flow” model advocated by some maximalists, but apparently many really, really believed in it – and its prediction that BTC would hit $100,000 by … well, by some imminent but frequently shifted deadline. (Changing the goalposts on confident predictions is also, by the way, how cults work.)  It’s remarkable how much stock to flow, on its face, reveals about the creeping simplemindedness of the maximalists. It’s effectively technical analysis extended to the nth degree – that is, well beyond any possible time horizon of validity. If the BTC price is based on adoption, it’s ridiculous to assume that the process will be linear or predictable.  That’s just not how technology – or money – works, especially at a global scale: There are fits and starts, changing circumstances, and most of all, bubbly spurts of enthusiasm broken up by fallow periods of disenchantment. Carter believes that maximalists have attacked him not just because they mistakenly thought he was one of them, but also because their faith in this simplistic, pseudo-religious schema of total and linear BTC dominance has been disproven by the current crash.  By contrast, every genuinely seasoned crypto observer knew a crash was coming sooner or later, because they’re attuned to the nuances of the market rather than committed to a narrative that Carter perfectly nails as a form of “millenarian eschatology.” Bitcoin maximalists effectively believe, like evangelical Christians, that the end of the old (fiat) world is inevitable, and that all rewards in the next (crypto) world will go to those who remained pure in their beliefs.  But purity is, at least in this case, the enemy of real-world victory. That’s illustrated in a small way by all the maxis who believed in stock-to-flow or the supercycle theory and are now sitting on huge losses because their unsophisticated analysis led them to buy the top of a manic retail bubble.  Bitcoin maximalism is an attack on bitcoin  Longer term, the maxis are increasingly a threat not just to their own bottom lines, but also to bitcoin itself. Because while bitcoin’s relatively conservative design and upgrade process is definitely part of its long-term appeal, maximalist commitment to the idea that it’s already perfect is another case of Manichaean (black or white) thinking that leads to oversimplification.  The sterling example here is the question of bitcoin’s long-term security. In brief, coinbase (small c, as in newly minted BTC) rewards for miners are scheduled to eventually expire, and there’s a lot of uncertainty about whether fee revenue will be enough to incentivize sufficient mining to keep the chain safe in the far-flung future. It’s not clear how serious a threat this is, but it needs to be discussed. That discussion needs to include the serious possibility that (gasp) bitcoin needs to change in a fairly dramatic way.  Bitcoin is good but it’s not perfect. Rigid ideologues’ refusal to let it change when it needs to could strangle their favorite digital pet with the sheer force of their love.

42421514,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoWI1,1657125246,New York Regulators Have Planted a Seed for Stablecoin Transparency,"Good news for stablecoin users: Stablecoin transparency standards are set to improve.  This comes courtesy of the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), which last month issued formal guidance for NYDFS-approved stablecoin issuers, including upgrades to the amount and quality of information that issuers must provide to the public.  J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog.  Increased transparency is a welcome development. It means users will have a better ability to vet stablecoins, and with more eyeballs on them, stablecoins issuers will be pressured to provide a safer product.  The new regulations will directly apply to gemini dollar (GUSD), issued by Gemini Trust, and binance USD (BUSD) and paxos dollar (USDP), issued by Paxos Trust. Those stablecoins were introduced in 2018 when the NYDFS initiated its regulatory framework for stablecoins.  Anyone who owns stablecoins that conforms to NYDFS standards will be able to sleep soundly at night  The NYDFS is one of the most influential financial regulators in the world. By dint of peer pressure and customer demand, one hopes these improvements spread to other large, non-NYDFS-regulated stablecoins like USD coin, tether, trueUSD – and also to stablecoins yet to emerge.  It’s all about the assets  When people debate the intricacies of stablecoins, the most pressing thing they want to know is what backs the stablecoin. There are good reasons for that.  With good old-fashioned bank deposits, a bank's deep layer of capital offers depositors a degree of protection should the bank's investments sour. Stablecoin issuers, however, lack the large amounts of capital that banks possess. Furthermore, unlike with bank deposits – which are insured by the government up to a certain amount – you're on your own if the stablecoin in your wallet fails.  So the safety of a stablecoin is highly dependent on the assets that are backing it. That's why the topic of stablecoin backing attracts so much attention in the press and on social media, and why transparency is so important.  The durability of a stablecoin’s underlying assets is important to more than just the people who own the stablecoin. It's also crucial to the broader crypto economy, because stablecoins act as the plumbing of crypto. If a major issuer like Tether were to fail, it would drive the entire ecosystem into a crisis.  One way for people to gain sufficient confidence in a stablecoin is by getting a peek at its internal workings. A stablecoin issuer accommodates that by providing public information about the assets backing the stablecoin. By doing so, the issuer gives a stablecoin credibility, which may help it grow and earn more profits – but only if the public approves of what it has seen in the sausage-making process.  To ensure the information about its assets can be trusted by the public, stablecoin issuers first pass it through the hands of an independent auditor. The auditor examines the information and offers its opinion on whether the numbers are accurately stated.  Read more: JP Koning - The Race for Stablecoin Transparency  The practice of providing the public with independently verified insights into stablecoin assets emerged in 2018 when the issuers of newly created stablecoins USD coin, gemini dollar and paxos dollar began to work with auditors to publish monthly ""attestation"" reports. Three years later, in 2021, Tether – issuer of the largest stablecoin – began to publish its own attestation reports, albeit quarterly.  This glance behind the curtains through the mediation of an independent auditor ultimately provides users like you and me with useful information.  But the glance that the public is afforded is good only if it is 1) timely, 2) provides a broad amount of useful information and 3) can be trusted.  The NYDFS's new standards address those three issues.  Timeliness  The utility of information degrades as it gets older, especially in the fast-moving crypto economy. The NYDFS new guidance requires attestation reports to be published monthly and no later than 30 days after the end of the month.  Stale attestation reports have been a problem among stablecoins issuers. In 2021, attestations for USDC were arriving 50 days after the attestation date. Tether's latest attestation was published 49 days after its March 31 attestation date. Users of this tardy information were left to speculate how the crypto declines of April, May and June may have affected Tether's finances.  Tether and USD coin aren't NYDFS-regulated coins and thus their issuers aren’t required to conform to the NYDFS’ standards on timeliness. However, given that competitor Paxos is implementing the standards for binance USD, Tether and Circle, the issuer of USD coin, may have no choice but to conform.  Completeness  A long look behind the curtains is better than a quick glimpse.  The NYDFS will broaden the amount of information available in attestation reports by requiring that stablecoin's assets be reported not only in aggregate, but also by asset class. So a stablecoin issuer would have to list how much commercial paper it owns, its allocation to money-market mutual funds, its deposits, its bonds and its quantity of Treasurys. That is, separately, instead of lumping it all together.  Some stablecoin issuers like Tether already do that. But others don't. The attestations for binance USD, for instance, inform us that Paxos may own deposits at banks, Treasury bills or Treasury bonds, but doesn't reveal what the proportions are.  Trustworthiness  An auditor's approval isn't worth much if the stablecoin can game the system. Of the updates to NYDFS' guidance, the most important ones will improve the trustworthiness of stablecoin reports. There are two ways it will do that.  First, the NYDFS will require auditors to not only examine a stablecoin’s end-of-the-month asset count, but also run a check on ""at least one randomly selected business day during the period."" Requiring a random in-between day examination prevents a stablecoin issuer from holding one set of risky assets for most of the month only to switch into safer assets the day before the auditor examines it.  Tether in particular should consider adopting the NYDFS’ random in-between day test as a best practice. Tether's three-month interlude between examinations is much longer than its competitors. By having its auditor test one random day during that period in addition to the end-of-period day, Tether would provide users with much needed assurance.  Second, the NYDFS will require that a stablecoin auditor provide an opinion on the effectiveness of a stablecoin issuer's internal controls. That must occur once a year.  Internal controls are the rules and procedures that companies adopt to prevent mistakes and fraud. They include separation of duties, verification of invoices, reconciliation and controlled access to financial reporting systems. After the Enron and WorldCom scandals of the early 2000s, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act made it necessary for U.S. public companies to undergo regular audits of internal controls.  At the present time, auditors that attest to the investments underlying stablecoins issued don't examine the effectiveness of an issuer's internal controls. An auditor need only acquire whatever ""degree of understanding"" of an issuer's internal controls that is necessary in order to carry out their assessment of its assets.  That's why all attestation reports contain something to the effect that ""we did not test the operating effectiveness of such controls and express no such opinion on such controls."" (That's from the attestation for paxos dollar.)  This is a black hole in current attestation practices. If internal controls aren't adequate, the numbers can’t be trusted. By requiring an auditor to examine a stablecoin issuer's internal controls every year to assure those controls are effective at promoting compliance with regulations, the NYDFS addresses this shortcoming.  Circle and Tether should consider voluntarily submitting their internal controls to annual examination and so reach the standards being met by their New York competitors. Because an organization's internal controls offer vital protection against fraud, anyone who owns stablecoins that conforms to NYDFS standards will be able to sleep soundly at night.",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | USDT | BNB,JP Koning,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/07/06/new-york-regulators-have-planted-a-seed-for-stablecoin-transparency,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3d1d2f23d50f12bc6b91b24a1763bd4208505367-5760x3840.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Speaking at the Qatar Centre for Global Banking and Finance’s annual conference, Cunliffe said recent events have delayed plans a bit. He’s likely referring to the last 24 hours, when Treasury chief Rishi Sunak and senior Treasury official Jon Glen resigned from their roles in Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government. Both Sunak and Glen had presented themselves as fans of crypto, announcing months ago their hope the U.K. would become a hub for digital assets.  In April, the Treasury, in its response to a stablecoin consultation from January, said that the government would initially look to regulate that sector of crypto using the 2017 Payment Service Regulations, Financial Services Act and the 2011 Electronic Money Regulations Act. It promised more detailed requirements for stablecoins to be developed with the help of the BoE, FCA and PSR.  Cunliffe also spoke about plans outside of the U.K., saying the committee on payments and market infrastructures (CPMI) – the international panel that Cunliffe chairs – will finalize guidance on global standards for systemic payment systems before the summer break. Among the issues: What assets should back these stablecoins, what should the redemption or claim be and how do you ensure if a stablecoin or money that is being used at a systemic level is safe. The CPMI also plans a report on how the Basel Framework for banking should apply to stablecoins, Cunliffe said.

Trading fees are being eliminated across 13 stablecoin and fiat combinations including BTC/USDT, BTC/USDC and BTC/BUSD, Binance announced Wednesday.  The cut in fees is an extension of a program the largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume introduced in the U.S. last month.  Zero-fee trading will take effect July 8 to coincide with the exchange's five-year anniversary this month. It will remain in place until further notice.  The move across the global Binance business follows two weeks after Binance.US removed trading fees on bitcoin spot pairs.

42393959,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brwaFF,1657122323,Is MakerDAO Becoming ‘a Company Run by Politics’?,"A week is a long time in politics, as the U.K. government is currently experiencing.  The same can be said about the recent drama, division and lobbying that gripped Ethereum’s pioneering decentralized money layer, MakerDAO.  A series of proposals that prompted the most voting ever by the Maker community was probably also the most meaningful clash – both in terms of ideology and institutional participation – in the history of any decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).  Read more: What Is a DAO?  The big picture is that MakerDAO stands at a crossroads concerning how its overcollateralized stablecoin, DAI, should be governed in the future. That future state may be uncertain, but there’s no question about the importance of a trustless, battle-tested system such as Maker, particularly now, as people bang the drum for decentralized finance (DeFi) and pile censure on opaque and centralized lending platforms.  It’s not the first time MakerDAO has been divided and embroiled in governance drama. In this most recent instance, however, a key area of focus was the debate over Maker’s Lending Oversight Core Unit (known as LOVE), which began its voting process on June 13. This unit successfully lobbied a cluster of venture capital firm investors, such as Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Paradigm and BlockTower, to use their combined Maker governance token (MKR) holdings to vote in favor of LOVE’s continued existence.  The LOVE unit, charged with advising on the onboarding of real-world borrowers and new types of collateral, was narrowly defeated just over a week ago, thanks to the considerable voting power of MakerDAO creator Rune Christensen plus others from the protocol’s founding team.  Nearly one-third of all MKR in circulation (around 294,000, or approximately $300 million) participated in the ratification of LOVE. The top three ""yes"" votes were said to be VC whales, or large holders, a16z, Paradigm and ParaFi, according to one DeFi researcher. On the side of ""no,"" which eventually won with around 60%, founder Christensen holds around 79,000 MKR.  In some corners of the Maker community, this battle has been portrayed as a bunch of bloodsucking VCs ganging up and attempting a carefully orchestrated coup – comparable to a company’s hostile takeover – bravely offset by Maker’s founding fathers, and an overall win for decentralization.  But that’s a woefully simplistic view, which belies the nuance surrounding Maker’s history of governance dilemmas and the complicated question of who’s really in charge at the end of the day.  Read more: Making MakerDAO Matter Again  LOVE’s labor  For Luca Prosperi, the proponent and outgoing lead at the LOVE unit, a pressing concern for the community must be how Maker founder Christensen and certain other members of the founding team could outvote the combined mass of VC firms invested in the platform. This means Maker is a de facto company controlled by a group of connected parties that operates through a somewhat redundant decentralization layer, says Prosperi.  “There is nothing bad in it, but we should call a company what it is,” Prosperi said in an interview. “We shouldn’t call it a community or a decentralized organization that has different voices; we should call it a corporation that has a CEO and has controlling shareholders. And given this, the CEO and effectively controlling parties should take full operational and legal responsibility when they call the shots, which means that maybe it should be regulated, maybe even incorporated – you cannot have it both ways.”  An important event in the lead-up to all this relates to a proposal made earlier this year to bring an SME loans platform called Monetalis into the Maker fold, with Maker as sole backer. Christensen and other founding members and large holders were lead investors in Monetalis, a fact that caused controversy within the community.  The move to onboard Monetalis was opposed by token holders, a position that followed a vocal negative opinion given by Prosperi, a finance professional with 20 years of experience working for firms like Morgan Stanley (MS). As such, Prosperi talks straight when it comes to assessing the caliber of those participants being invited onto the platform.  “There were businesses coming in with proposals to actively manage $500 million or $1 billion with zero experience and zero skin in the game, as well as zero track record, which I found to be frankly substandard,” said Prosperi.  Wake-up call  The broader problem that Prosperi calls out is that leadership of the crypto and DeFi community is very immature with little to no experience in traditional financial markets. “You have young engineers who became billionaires in their 20s,” he said. “But credit is a zero-sum game and not the space for centralized and inexperienced teams with crazily aggressive plans anymore. We should have learned it by now. We need to step up our game with good checks and balances, as well as more engagement from institutions and, inevitably, regulators.”  Maker founder Christensen called the recent close-run votes and the involvement of VCs “a big political awakening” and said that ultimately it’s a good thing that groups with different perspectives want to make decisions about the direction of the DAO because the “status quo was kind of chaos.”  Christensen, who acknowledges his investment in Monetalis could be viewed as a conflict of interest, also says he’s in favor of a sturdy core unit overseeing lending, for example. His problem is a change of direction whereby core units are getting involved in governance decisions, something that should remain the purview of the token holders.  “Basically, my position is that core units should be neutral,” Christensen said in an interview, adding that he detects a fundamental change in direction to empower “managers” to run Maker as if it were a business. “I think there’s still hope to do decentralized organizations without having to resort to hierarchy, without managers and executives in charge of a kind of coordinated responsibility for the DAO,” he said.  Make Maker great again  None of the VCs who voted to defend the lending oversight committee chose to comment on what exactly invigorated them to rally together. A representative from Andreessen Horowitz pointed to the forum comment of Porter Smith, a deal partner on the a16z crypto team, which praised the LOVE unit’s credit-risk framework for onboarding real-world assets.  But MakerDAO researcher Mika Honkasalo believes timing has a lot to do with what activated the VCs. This is a very important moment in Maker’s history, Honkasalo said, citing the blowups and balance sheet hits happening to centralized crypto firms right now.  “In a bull market, VCs are maybe more focused on other things, but now it’s a bear market and they’re thinking about their investments. Stablecoins are the biggest use case in crypto and this is the number one attempt to do it in a decentralized fashion. They can see this is a great opportunity; that’s why they invested in the first place.”  ‘Company run by politics’  These types of divisive moments in MakerDAO’s history have been labeled “governance drama,” Christensen said, and are generally viewed as temporary growing pains with the expectation that “eventually everyone will come together and be totally objective and the whole thing will just run like a computer program.”  However, Christensen has become convinced the reality is the DAO is heading in the opposite direction, which prompted his complex “Endgame Plan,” part of which includes an attempt to organize token holders into “Decentralized Voter Committees” designed to align MKR holders to some degree and address a lack of clarity about what they want. It will also set up a framework to incentivize more widespread governance participation by distributing DAO token rewards to users who get involved in decision-making processes.  “What we are seeing is the true face of what a DAO actually is,” Christensen said. “It’s like a company run by politics, almost. Of course, it’s not a real company. But that’s what you get if you don’t have a leader; something that’s more like a parliament. Except there isn’t even a precedent for anything like that.”",NEUTRAL,MKR,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | MKR | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/07/06/is-makerdao-becoming-a-company-run-by-politics,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3211f84a9da6bf42bf9bf870cb0b957c494d4ac9-1143x843.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374325,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZDQl,1657121687,Here's What Still Needs to Happen Before the EU's MiCA Bill Becomes Law,"Last week, the European Union sealed deals on two landmark crypto laws – but that political agreement is just the start for companies looking to operate in the bloc.  In two successive meetings, negotiators from the European Parliament met with government diplomats to hammer into shape its new Markets in Crypto Assets law, known as MiCA, alongside controversial identity checks contained in the Transfer of Funds Regulation.  It has been a long road. Back in 2018, the European Commission, responsible for putting forward bills, first raised concerns over unregulated coin offerings leading to investor ripoffs; its proposed draft of MiCA followed in September 2020, based on advice from EU agencies the European Banking Authority (EBA) and European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).  Meanwhile, the idea of checking and reporting the identity of crypto payers – based on a model from the existing banking system – stems from 2019 recommendations from the Financial Action Task Force, a global anti-money laundering watchdog.  But the legislation isn’t in place yet. Even once it is, there will be some details to be fleshed out and the prospect of more legislation.  The bill’s still not law  While the main features of the law have been agreed to in principle by lead negotiators, they have yet to publish a full text. Once the text is available, governments – which meet in the EU’s Council – and lawmakers at the European Parliament will have to make sure their demands were met. That will happen through a series of votes.  Read more: EU Agrees on Landmark Crypto Authorization Law, MiCA  Even once a final text is entered into the bloc’s Official Journal, companies will have a transition period in which to prepare for the rules.  The European Parliament said 18 months would be enough time for exchanges to verify the identity of their customers and for crypto firms to seek authorization from national or European regulators – though companies already operating would get 18 months longer.  Given the lengthy summer break enjoyed by EU officials and the need to translate laws into the bloc’s two dozen languages, completing the bill isn’t likely to happen before this fall, with rules actually taking effect around 2024.  Details to settle  Even then, the law still won’t be fully colored in. The finer procedural details, ranging from how companies can seek stablecoin approval to cybersecurity and liquidity standards, must then be hammered out via rulemaking from EU agencies responsible for guidelines and standards.  Read more: No AML Checks For Most Transfers To Unhosted Crypto Wallets, EU Policymakers Decide  “The full process is not finalized yet,” Marina Markezic, executive director of the European Crypto Initiative, told CoinDesk. “There's going to be a lot of work done also with different agencies, like ESMA, EBA, etc. Broad definitions will need to be filled in with some of the work from those institutions.”  Though the law applies directly to all of the EU’s 27 member nations, in practice it’s national regulators who must implement much of it. Some may end up being tougher than others, and disputes will need to be adjudicated.  “Over time, we’ll see how our different regulators and also courts might interpret” the laws, Markezic said.  Likely more to come  Emerging from the talks that dragged on for nearly seven hours last Thursday, EU financial services commissioner Mairead McGuinness didn’t seem to be enthusiastic about reopening some of the more controversial areas of the legislation. That appears to include a largely unsuccessful lawmaker bid to curb the energy-intensive proof-of-work method used to mine bitcoin (BTC).  “I wouldn't say tonight there's anything I want to do” on the environmental issue, McGuinness told CoinDesk. “At least this one [law] is over the line … I think what we need to do is complete our work program, rather than think of extra.”  Read more: EU Parliamentarians Push to Limit Bitcoin Use Over Energy Concerns  Yet MiCA as drafted now remains relatively narrowly focused on issues like stablecoin reserves and investor information for initial coin offerings. It’s unlikely to be the last word in crypto regulation as policymakers look to emerging trends.  In June, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde called for a sequel to cover issues like crypto staking and decentralized finance. Policymakers may well take up that advice, aided by numerous hooks in MiCA that urge them to probe topics such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  “No legislation is ever set in stone,” McGuinness said. “No legislation in the area of crypto could be … It has evolved, and is evolving.”  She will also be looking at whether other jurisdictions follow the EU’s lead – echoing an earlier call she made in The Hill for common rules against investor fraud, insider trading and environmental impacts.  “This is a global development around crypto, and therefore, it is important that there is global cooperation around it,” McGuinness told CoinDesk. “It's important that we don't regulate on our own: Others need to do so as well.”  Lawmakers who didn’t get all they wanted from MiCA or the transfer of funds may try again by amending other bills under deliberation.  Read more: Biden Official Says US Government Could Pass Stablecoin Rules by End of Year  Left-wing lawmakers have sought to amend EU money-laundering regulations that are already heaped on entities like banks and real estate agents to also cover Web3 innovations like NFT platforms.  Some also hope a bill on European digital identity – intended to make it easier to prove who you are online using conventional ID cards and currently being discussed by parliament committees – could be repurposed to make checks on unhosted wallets easier.

The shares have also been halted on over-the-counter markets in the U.S.  The Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada announced Wednesday that Voyager Digital's stock trading on TSX had been halted as of 8 a.m. ET. The Toronto Stock Exchange later announced it had begun an expedited delisting review. The shares are also halted in the U.S., where they trade over the counter under the ticker symbol VYGVF.  The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the Southern District of New York late Tuesday, with estimates that it had more than 10,000 creditors and between $1 billion and $10 billion in assets with the same range for its liabilities.  The crypto broker's loan book is estimated to be nearly 60% composed of loans to crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which Voyager CEO Steven Ehrlich blamed for most of his company's woes. Three Arrows Capital filed for bankruptcy on July 1 following a court order in the British Virgin Islands to liquidate.  As with fellow lender Celsius Network, Voyager has suffered severe losses with the downturn in the crypto markets in recent weeks, culminating in it suspending trading, deposits and withdrawals at the start of the month.

42374331,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZDVn,1657119571,Riot Blockchain Starts Move Away From New York Hosting Site,"Riot Blockchain, one of the largest bitcoin miners in the U.S., started moving its bitcoin mining rigs from a hosting site in New York to its own mine in Texas to cut down on costs.  Riot expects the move from the Coinmint facility in Massena, N.Y., to its Whinstone mine in Rockdale, Texas, to reduce electricity costs and eliminate third-party hosting fees, the miner said in a Wednesday statement. About 5,700 of Riot's bitcoin mining rigs are offline as a result of the move and the rest of its fleet will likely be shipped in July, the statement said.  Part of the transition is a miner swap agreement, Riot said. Bit Digital said it signed a deal with Riot on June 9 to swap its brand new machines with Riot's operational ones in Massena. Bit Digital's hashrate has fallen since it moved its operations out of China following a crackdown last year.  Riot also said that it received 1,273 Antminer S19j Pro machines from manufacturer Bitmain in June, deployed another 4,676 in its immersion-cooled buildings and has a further 6,324 ""staged for deployment."" Riot expects 6,333 more S19j Pros to arrive this month.  Rack space has been a limiting factor for bitcoin miners in recent months as facilities have been full and new buildouts delayed. Riot is working on expanding the capacity of the Whinstone facility by 400 megawatts (MW), which would bring it to 750 MW. That would make it the largest crypto mine in the U.S.  Riot, however, decreased its hashrate expectations for the year to 12.5 exahash per second (EH/s). The downgrade follows June's reduced forecast, when it said it expected 12.6 EH/s by January 2023, below May's prediction of 12.8 EH/s. The miner produced 421 bitcoins in June, compared with 466 BTC in May, the statement said.  This is the fourth consecutive month that Riot Blockchain has sold bitcoin, and the sales are yielding diminishing returns. In June, it raised about $6.2 million by selling 300 bitcoins, compared with May's $7.5 million from the sale of 250 bitcoins. The company previously held on to its bitcoin production. Riot still takes a ""long-term view on its bitcoin holdings and believes it is in the best interest of shareholders to have strong bitcoin holdings,"" the Wednesday statement reiterated.  Miners have been selling their holdings to cover costs and loan obligations as their revenues have dwindled along with the price of bitcoin and ether.

We did not see active buy protection in the $1400 range during ETH last bearish impulse. The ETH price during the trading week of 13 June touched the mark of $894. After such an aggressive move, sellers did not feel any struggle. In fact, buyers could not organize even an elementary rebound to the $1400 mark. And this is the range of the former historical high. Such a lack of interest in one of the largest cryptocurrencies is a bit alarming. Source: https://www.tradingview.com/x/oeSfySdc/ If buyers fail to take control of the $1200-$1400 range during July, we see no obstacles for sellers to continue the fall with a final target of $570. A continuation of the fall to this mark without a correction will mean the collapse of the ETH cryptocurrency. How long it will take to restore the market, accumulate positions for growth and buy out all sellers is unknown. Thus, in such a scenario, you should not rush to buy ETH right away.

42374338,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZDdL,1657115390,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin at $20.1K as Crypto Lender Voyager Files for Bankruptcy,"Good morning, and welcome to First Mover. I’m Lyllah Ledesma, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights.  Price Point: Crypto markets are trading in the green Wednesday morning as on-chain data shows Celsius has paid down $183 million of its collateralized debt to Maker.  Market Moves: All the latest on crypto lender Voyager's bankruptcy filing.  Price point  Crypto markets were mostly trading in the green on Wednesday morning even as another crypto lender declared bankruptcy.  Voyager Digital, a crypto lender, filed for bankruptcy late Tuesday, becoming the second high-profile crypto firm to do so in the last week.  The Toronto-based company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the Southern District Court of New York, estimating that it had more than 100,000 creditors and somewhere between $1 and $10 billion in assets. It also recorded the same range for its liabilities. (More on this down below in Market Moves.)  This comes after hedge fund Three Arrows Capital filed for bankruptcy a few days ago after weeks of speculation about the company's solvency.  Bitcoin (BTC) was up 2% on the day, trading at $20,000. Ether (ETH) was trading up on the day slightly at $1,100. Altcoins took the lead, with Avalanche’s AVAX up 6% on the day. The virtual gaming ecosystem, Sandbox (SAND), was up 10%.  Meanwhile, CoinDesk’s Krisztian Sandor reported that the crypto lender Celsuis has been aggressively repaying debt on one of the largest decentralized finance protocols, blockchain data shows.  This is perhaps in effort to get back bitcoin-equivalent tokens that had been posted on the platform as collateral. Since July 1, according to the on-chain data, Celsius has paid down $183 million of its collateralized debt to Maker.  The troubled crypto lender is also reportedly cutting jobs to stave off its liquidity crisis.  Over in traditional markets, the pound has slid to a two-year low against the dollar. On Tuesday, the sterling fell below $1.19 for the first time since March 2020.  Futures tied to the S&P 500 shed 0.2% and the Nasdaq-100 slipped 0.3%.  Market moves  By Nikhilesh De and Danny Nelson  Crypto lender Voyager Digital filed for bankruptcy late Tuesday, becoming the second high-profile crypto firm to do so in recent days.  The Toronto-based Voyager filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protections Tuesday in the Southern District of New York, estimating that it had more than 100,000 creditors and somewhere between $1 and $10 billion in assets. It also recorded the same range for its liabilities.  The company believes that “funds will be available for distribution to unsecured creditors,” according to the filing.  Voyager Digital Holdings, Inc., Voyager Digital, LLC and Voyager Digital Ltd. all filed for bankruptcy.  Crypto companies – and lenders in particular – have faced solvency issues in recent weeks, with several stopping customers from withdrawing their funds. Celsius kicked off this trend last month, announcing in mid-June that it would suspend withdrawals. CoinLoan, CoinFLEX and Voyager itself all announced restrictions or outright halts on withdrawals in recent days.  Voyager joins Three Arrows Capital in filing for bankruptcy. Three Arrows, however, filed a Chapter 15 petition tied to an ongoing liquidation effort ordered by a court in the British Virgin Islands.  According to writer Frances Coppola, Voyager’s loan book accounted for nearly half of its total assets, and nearly 60% of that loan book was composed of loans to Three Arrows.  In a statement posted online after this article was published, Voyager CEO Steven Ehrlich said reorganizing the company ""is the best way to protect"" the company's assets, and pointed the finger at Three Arrows for some of its woes.  Following that statement, Ehrlich posted on Twitter that ""Customers with crypto in their account(s) will receive in exchange a combination of the crypto in their account(s), proceeds from the 3AC recovery, common shares in the newly reorganized Company, and Voyager tokens.""  ‘FDIC’ protections?  The filing comes as industry observers increase their scrutiny of Voyager’s business practices, particularly how the Canadian-listed firm said in marketing materials that investors' deposits were protected by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance.  While FDIC insurance would indeed protect bank-held cash deposits up to $250,000, it would not cover cash converted to stablecoins. Commentators including Coppola have called Voyager’s marketing around its handling of deposits misleading.  Moreover, the FDIC insurance kicks in in the event of a bank failure – in this case, Voyager was banked by Metropolitan Commercial Bank. There is no protection in the event of a Voyager failure.

After the weekly candle from 13 June, the dynamics of the Bitcoin price decreased significantly. During the next 3 weeks, the main battleground for market participants is in the $19,000 range. Basically, there has been no bounce back up after the strong Bitcoin fall wave since March 2020. Forming a consolidation above the range of $19,000, buyers hint at the beginning of the formation of a rebound with the final target of $29,000-$30,000. However, these hints are extremely weak and not supported by anything. Source: Tradingview For a confident purchase of Bitcoin, it is worth waiting for the $21,700 mark to break. If, after breaking this mark, the BTC price does not fall below $21,700, it will be a strong signal to buy Bitcoin and expect $29,000-$30,000. The price-fixing below $19,000 will maximize the chances of sellers to continue Bitcoin fall without a correction, with the next target at $13,000. The last line of protection for buyers, in this case, will be around the $18,000 mark. Technical Analysis Of BTC On The Daily Time Frame Source: Tradingview Analyzing the movement of the BTC price on the daily timeframe, you can see how sellers are effortlessly trying to push the price below $19,000.

The startup’s dedicated NFT wallet aims to be an interoperable way for NFT aficionados to display their collections. The platform is available on mobile devices as an app, and is currently compatible with Ethereum and Tezos blockchains, though the company plans on adding more integrations in the coming months, according to a representative.  The wallet works in tandem with the company’s other product Feral File, a platform that allows users to create virtual exhibitions of their collections.  Bitmark CEO Sean Moss-Pultz sees the industry around the burgeoning digital art movement as still in its infancy. While interest in the space has never been higher, creative ways to display NFTs haven’t kept up.  “I think in the next year or two, we're going to see a ton of innovation in space,” Moss-Pultz told CoinDesk in an interview. “The reason that I strongly believe this is I know of a number of larger display manufacturers that are making dedicated, really beautiful panels just for displaying digital art.”  Other companies getting in on the action include Bright Moments, which has been putting on pop-up NFT galleries around the world for high-profile generative artists, and Web3 Gallery, an NFT-dedicated art gallery in New York City positioning itself as “the BestBuy of NFTs.”  Galaxy Interactive and North Island Ventures led Bitmark’s funding round.

They further denied any reports of an exploit or hack.  “The $GARI token was affected majorly on KuCoin,” developers said, referring to the crypto exchange. “The reason identified is the $2 million market sell order at 16:10 UTC on 4th July 2022, pushed the token price to $0.14 suddenly as the market maker didn't provide enough liquidity to handle it.”  Developers said the $2 million sell order and lack of liquidity caused cascading liquidations on KuCoin, which sent prices from 71 cents to as low as 3 cents. Prices bounced to the 10 cents level in the hours afterward.  The team denied any wrongdoing. “We confirm that there was no insider trading,” developers said, linking to a blockchain wallet that holds the team’s allocated tokens.

While the European Union is finalizing its landmark Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA), issuers in the meantime need to know if cryptocurrencies are subject to existing securities laws, Belgium's Financial Services and Markets Authority (FSMA) said.  “While awaiting a harmonized European approach, the FSMA wishes to provide clarity about when crypto-assets may be considered to be securities, investment instruments or financial instruments and may therefore fall within the scope of the prospectus legislation and/or the MiFID conduct of business rules,” said the regulator.  Read more: Brussels’ Fledgling Crypto Industry Flexes Its Muscles  MiCA will oblige crypto issuers to issue a White Paper of information for investors. Until that takes effect – expected sometime in 2024 – regulators will use a bundle of illustrative characteristics to figure out if a cryptoasset falls under the existing prospectus law which applies to stocks and bonds, according to the report.  The EU’s Markets in Financial instruments Directive (MiFID) requires financiers to be clear and honest when approaching potential investors, and not to have conflicts of interest. Assets like bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) wouldn’t be subject to either prospectus or MiFID rules because they have no issuer, but are instead created by computer code, the document said.

The new miners at Hut 8's North Bay site in Ontario were operating on 20 megawatts (MW) of power as of June 30, the company said in a Wednesday statement. Its total operating capacity in computing power was 2.78 exahash/second (EH/s).  The company mined 328 bitcoins during June, increasing its holdings to 7,406 BTC ($148 million).

42393812,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpBMTJ,1657107000,Are Block Builders the Key to Solving Ethereum’s MEV Centralization Woes?,"Post-Merge Ethereum will trigger a paradigm shift that’s much more far-reaching than a mere switch from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. Adopting a modular approach at the infrastructure level may usher in a new breed of stakeholder: the block builder.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Building blocks on Ethereum  Under proof-of-work, Ethereum has two major stakeholders on the transaction side: users and miners. There are, of course, several other key groups such as core developers, exchanges and wallets, but without users and miners, there would be no network.  Users pay gas fees to have their transactions processed by miners who collect those transactions from the Ethereum ""mempool,"" which is a database of unconfirmed transactions, and place them into blocks in a specific order. Miners typically operate in groups called mining pools. The idea is to pool resources in order to generate a consistent level of revenue for each miner and to benefit from the experience, expertise and software infrastructure of the mining pool operator.  Mining pool operators are very powerful players in the Ethereum network, because of their ability to determine transaction order and therefore extract “maximal extractable value” (MEV) for all blocks processed by their pool.  MEV involves optimizing the mining process to maximize revenue. This is typically achieved by determining which transactions to include and in what order. Ideally, the most profitable configuration of transactions with the highest level of fees is chosen.  Read more: The Problem With MEV on Ethereum  According to CryptoCompare, only five mining pools controlled 65.4% of mining activity on the Ethereum network last November. That raises serious concerns about centralization deep in Ethereum’s infrastructure. Case in point: Ethermine alone controlled 25% of all mining during that month.     The post-Merge changing of the guard  As Ethereum switches from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, miners will disappear and validators will replace them. There will be a key difference, however. Instead of combining the process of creating and validating blocks, Ethereum’s post-Merge proof-of-stake system will adopt a modular approach.  Modularity is when individual components of a system independently execute specific tasks. The concept has been around in computer science since the 1960s. We saw the emphasis on modularity when Eth1 and Eth2 were renamed. Ethereum’s original proof-of-work chain became Eth1, the “execution layer” where Ethereum’s applications reside, while the Beacon Chain became Eth2, the “consensus layer” where nodes will agree on the state of the network.  This modular approach will eventually carry over into the processing of transactions in the form of proposer-builder separation (PBS). In its most basic sense, PBS simply involves splitting block building and block validation into two distinct activities. The result is a new stakeholder group called the block builder.  In a recent episode of the “Bankless” podcast, Matt Cutler, co-founder and CEO of Blocknative, provided an overview of block builders and how he sees them cooperating with other key stakeholders in the Ethereum ecosystem.  Cutler describes how MEV searchers and miners currently interact. Searchers typically use sophisticated bots that seek to maximize MEV in a variety of ways. Some of those ways like arbitrage are benign, while other ways like front-running are perceived as malicious. In either case, the searcher sequences transactions, produces a revenue-optimized transaction bundle and then offers that bundle to a miner or validator for inclusion in a block in exchange for a cut of the profits.  In a post-Merge proof-of-stake system, block builders will enter the scene. Instead of searchers offering transactions directly to validators (also called proposers), they will send optimized transaction bundles to block builders. A third-party system called MEV-Boost will then aggregate optimized blocks from a variety of builders and offer them to validators. Finally, validators will select and propose the most profitable blocks to the Ethereum network.  Here come the block builders  Flashbots, the creators of MEV-Boost, explain that MEV centralization occurs when mining and staking pools vertically integrate with trading firms to increase MEV profit. The Flashbots website claims MEV-Boost was created to prevent post-Merge MEV centralization and to cultivate a diverse network of block builders.  Read more: Is Ethereum Staking Pool Lido’s Growth an Omen of Centralization?  According to Cutler, the Ethereum community is so bullish on MEV-Boost that developers plan to incorporate the concept of PBS into Ethereum’s core protocol a year or two after the transition to proof-of-stake. In the meantime, if all goes according to plan, MEV-Boost will be available immediately after the Merge.

WHY IT MATTERS: Last weekend, Argentines purchased between two and three times as many stablecoins as they do on a typical weekend.

WHY IT MATTERS: On June 30, The European Commission agreed on new laws known as the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations that would license crypto companies and impose identity checks on transactions. An amendment to those anti-money-laundering laws was proposed that seeks to make NFT platforms “obliged entities” under the European Union’s law. That would mean that NFT marketplaces like OpenSea might have to assess the risk of illicit finance flowing through their systems. Read more here.

42374342,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZDeb,1657105227,Bitcoin Recovers Above $20K as Short ETF Sees Record $51M in Weekly Inflows,"Bitcoin (BTC) coasted over the $20,000 mark Wednesday morning even as recession fears linger among investors and an institutional product to short the asset gained traction last week.  Bitcoin rose some 2% in the past 24 hours, continuing a gradual recovery after last month’s sudden drop to the $17,700 level. The asset faces resistance at the $21,500 level, price charts show, while support exists at the $18,800 mark.  The recovery came as institutional traders piled into the ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITI), a recently launched exchange-traded fund that bets against the prices of bitcoin. It saw some $51 million worth of inflows over the past week, as per a report earlier this week by crypto fund CoinShares. The figure is a record high since the ETF’s launch in late June.  “Investment products saw inflows totaling US$64 [million] last week,” CoinShares analysts said. “Although the headline figures obscure the fact that a significant majority were into short-bitcoin investment products (US$51m).”  However, CoinShares said the inflows into BITI were likely from being one of the first offerings that allow shorting exposure via futures contracts for investors as opposed to a change in sentiment.  “The inflows into short-bitcoin possibly due to first-time accessibility in the U.S. rather than renewed negative sentiment,” CoinShares said, pointing out that bitcoin long products from Canada, Europe and Germany saw a combined $20 million in inflows.  However, some market observers said the inflows into short positions suggest investors expect a downtrend instead of continued recovery in the coming weeks.  “People who are involved in the market think that the bottom is still to come, so if they can't make money on the rise, they want to make money on the fall by shorting Bitcoin,” shared Pawel Cichowski, head of dealing at crypto exchange XBO, in a Telegram message.  “With signs of a global recession coming up and the bond yield curve inverting, nobody knows for sure where the price of bitcoin will go next. However, based on ProShares statistics, people are preferring to expect the worst,” Cichowski added.  The increase in short bitcoin funds outflows comes weeks after institutional investors withdrew over $423 million from crypto products, as earlier reported.  Such moves come amid rising concerns of inflation and recession among investors. In an appearance at the European Central Bank’s annual forum last week, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated the central bank's commitment to increasing interest rates to curtail inflation.  Powell added he was more concerned about the challenge posed by inflation than about the possibility of higher interest rates pushing the U.S. economy into a recession. The latest forecasts from Bloomberg Economics have pegged the odds of a U.S. recession in the next year at 38%.  Meanwhile, market sentiment remained mixed among equity traders on Wednesday. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng, Japan’s Nikkei 225, and the Shanghai Composite dropped over 1.2% since Wednesday’s start, while Europe’s Stoxx 600 and Germany’s DAX gained 1.3%.

The move comes amid declining crypto prices as broader equity markets reflect recession concerns.  The service enabled decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) to issue bonds as a means of raising funds in return for paying yields to users. These bonds provided a flexible, long-term credit option that offered advantages over loans for the protocols.  However, in Wednesday’s note, Porter said it was “not confident” there would be large inflows of lending demand for fixed-income DeFi products such as those offered on its platform.  This was primarily due to the competitiveness of rates offered in traditional finance and the lack of institutional fixed income DeFi adoption over the past year, the note said.  Porter founder Jordan Meyer said the platform was also shunning legal risks with the move. “We are also no longer willing to take on the legal risk associated with bond offerings,” Meyer said, without saying what those risks might be. “For these reasons, we are pivoting away from the bond issuance platform and exploring better opportunities.”  Porter did not immediately respond to requests for comments at press time.  Meyer said the move did not affect obligations that Ribbon DAO – which used Porter to issue its bonds – has to its lenders. “Ribbon DAO is still bound by its promise to repay,” he said.  Ribbon holds over $71 million in various cryptocurrencies, trackers show.

Meta's new head of fintech, Stephane Kasriel, said in an interview with the Financial Times that the company's plans around non-fungible tokens (NFT) have not changed ""in any way.""  “The opportunity [Meta] sees is for the hundreds of millions or billions of people that are using our apps today to be able to collect digital collectibles, and for the millions of creators out there that could potentially create virtual and digital goods to be able to sell them through our platforms,” Kasriel said.  He added that the blockchain industry has performed a ""hype cycle,"" in which initial enthusiasm crashes in a bear market and many sectors do not survive.  Meta considers NFTs an opportunity to attract creators back to Facebook or Instagram that may otherwise be drifting towards TikTok by giving them a means of monetizing their content.  The social media giant made its ambitions for the digital assets industry clear in October when it changed its corporate name from Facebook to Meta, a nod to its plans to build a metaverse in which digital collectibles represented by NFTs are bought, sold and collected.  At the start of this month, Meta began testing Polygon- and Ethereum-based NFTs among selected users on Facebook.  Meta did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for further comment.

42374334,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZDX3,1657087722,Voyager Seeks Bankruptcy Protection Amid Crypto Credit Crisis,"Crypto lender Voyager Digital filed for bankruptcy late Tuesday, becoming the second high-profile crypto firm to do so in recent days.  The Toronto-based Voyager filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protections Tuesday in the U.S. Southern District Court of New York, estimating that it had more than 100,000 creditors and somewhere between $1 billion and $10 billion in assets. It also recorded the same range for its liabilities.  The company believes that “funds will be available for distribution to unsecured creditors,” according to the filing.  Voyager Digital Holdings, Inc., Voyager Digital, LLC and Voyager Digital Ltd. all filed for bankruptcy.  Crypto companies – and lenders in particular – have faced solvency issues in recent weeks, with several stopping customers from withdrawing their funds. Celsius kicked off this trend last month, announcing in mid-June that it would suspend withdrawals. CoinLoan, CoinFLEX and Voyager itself all announced restrictions or outright halts on withdrawals in recent days.  Voyager joins Three Arrows Capital in filing for bankruptcy. Three Arrows, however, filed a Chapter 15 petition tied to an ongoing liquidation effort ordered by a court in the British Virgin Islands.  According to writer Frances Coppola, Voyager’s loan book accounted for nearly half of its total assets, and nearly 60% of that loan book was composed of loans to Three Arrows.  In a statement posted online after this article was published, Voyager CEO Steven Ehrlich said reorganizing the company ""is the best way to protect"" the company's assets, and pointed the finger at Three Arrows for some of its woes.  Following that statement, Ehrlich posted on Twitter, ""Customers with crypto in their account(s) will receive in exchange a combination of the crypto in their account(s), proceeds from the 3AC recovery, common shares in the newly reorganized Company, and Voyager tokens.""  ‘FDIC’ protections?  The filing comes as industry observers increase their scrutiny of Voyager’s business practices, particularly how the Canadian-listed firm said in marketing materials that investors' deposits were protected by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance.  While FDIC insurance would indeed protect bank-held cash deposits up to $250,000, it would not cover cash converted to stablecoins. Commentators including Coppola have called Voyager’s marketing around its handling of deposits misleading.  Moreover, the FDIC insurance kicks in in the event of a bank failure – in this case, Voyager was banked by Metropolitan Commercial Bank. There is no protection in the event of a Voyager failure.  Creditors  According to the filing, Voyager Digital, Ltd.'s equity holders include Alameda Research Ventures LLC and Alameda Ventures Ltd., two companies associated with Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of crypto exchange FTX, who has extended credit lines or otherwise bailed out other crypto companies.  Voyager also owes Google nearly $1 million, according to the filing.  Voyager's stock, already battered by the crypto market selloff, was trading at 27 cents at market close Tuesday, giving the company a market cap of $65 million Canadian dollars (around US$50 million). That's smaller than the $75 million unsecured loan issued by Alameda Research, according to the bankruptcy filings.  The stock traded above $20 in November, but fell below a dollar last month.  Voyager also claimed in its blog post that it had $110 million in cash, $350 million in cash at Metropolitan, $1.3 billion in crypto and was owed $650 million from Three Arrows. It did not say what specifically the liabilities are.  Shares are currently halted from trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange ahead of what is expected to be a delisting.

The world&apos;s second-biggest cryptocurrency has experienced a robust comeback in a short span of time, with buying activity over the U.S. market holiday bolstering prices. But, can ETH sustain this rally? Or, will it be for the time being. This year, concerns about a U.S. economic slump and a slew of crypto bankruptcy have harmed the altcoin. In the previous 24 hours, ETH/USD fluctuated between $1,086 and $1,165, showing high volatility. The trading volume for the pair has climbed by 32 percent to a total of $15.3 billion, while the entire market capitalization fluctuates about $132 billion. Suggested Reading | Bitcoin (BTC) Claws Back To $20,000, First Time In 5 Days Ethereum (ETH) Breaches $1,000 Resistance Since the previous significant swing down at $1,000 seven days ago, the ETH price has been reversing slowly. After several days of stability, the ETH/USD pair continued to advance and blew through the prior resistance at $1,100. On Tuesday, only tiny pauses preceded each subsequent upward push throughout the day. Overnight, the next level of resistance at $1,175 was already breached, suggesting that bullish energy is currently strong and that the intermediate-term pricing mechanism may soon begin seeing green again.

Follow CoinDesk Brasil on Twitter.  Global crypto exchange Binance resumed deposits in Brazilian reals through the government's payment system Pix on Tuesday.  Update July 6 (21:15 UTC): On Wednesday, Binance enabled withdrawals in Brazilian reals via Pix on its website, although they are not yet available on its app. That functionality will be available ""soon,"" the company added.  On June 17, the company suspended the deposits and withdrawals through Pix after it terminated a partnership with the local payment gateway Capitual, which had operated Binance’s deposits and withdrawals via Pix since 2020.  Replacing Capitual, Binance is now operating with the Brazilian payments platform Latam Gateway, which uses the bank accounts hosted by BS2, a bank licensed by the Central Bank of Brazil (BC) to access the Pix network.

Capitual then stated it would sue Binance because it had failed to comply with a BC regulation requiring the exchange to single out user accounts.  According to newspaper Folha de S.Paulo, a company that had one of Capitual's founders as a partner allegedly helped launder money for Glaidson Acácio dos Santos, known in Brazil as the “Bitcoin Pharaoh,” who is under arrest for allegedly leading a criminal organization responsible for promoting Ponzi schemes involving cryptocurrencies.  On Sunday, the local newspaper Valor Econômico reported that the São Paulo Court of Justice (TJSP) blocked 451.6 million Brazilian reais ($84.6 million) from Capitual's accounts, which would belong to Binance clients.  In a statement, Binance said that Capitual's “actions conflict with its values,” and assured that it “has taken all necessary and appropriate measures in relation to Capitual to protect users and their resources and ensure that they are not adversely affected by the change” of payment provider.
