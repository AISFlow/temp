According to Arkham Intelligence X’s post on Dec. 12, BlackRock and Fidelity acquired more than half of a billion dollars in Ethereum ( ETH ) in the past two days. This transaction was made through Coinbase Prime. “PAST 48 HOURS: BLACKROCK AND FIDELITY BOUGHT OVER HALF A BILLION USD OF ETH,” Arkham mentioned on post It also shows that the two ETF issuers are taking more action in their portfolio by acquiring more Ether after receiving approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) in May. iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) from BlackRock is the largest issuer, with a total inflow of up to $2.93 billion. Along with Fidelity, this crypto-product has received inflow up to 8 days in a row. Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) is the second-largest issuer, with a total inflow of up to $1.35 billion.

Qubetics Surpasses 305M Tokens Sold While Cardano And Fantom Make Noise,"Are you keeping up with the latest buzz in crypto? Cardano and Fantom have been making noise with exciting developments, and everyone’s asking: which are the best altcoins to buy for 2025? But wait—there’s a new player in town. Enter Qubetics ($TICS) , a project already raising eyebrows with its innovative tech and presale tally of over $5.5 million. While established players like Cardano are streamlining blockchain ecosystems and Fantom is chasing life-changing gains, Qubetics offers something fresh—a solution to privacy concerns and scalability issues with its decentralised VPN (dVPN). Could this be the one that redefines decentralised tech? Let’s dive into what makes these three coins stand out. Qubetics: The Rising Star Solving Real-World Problems Qubetics is creating waves for all the right reasons. The project, now in its 12th presale stage, has already sold over 305 million $TICS tokens, with a growing community of more than 8,400 token holders. At a presale price of just $0.0311, this could be a golden opportunity for early adopters. So, why is Qubetics special? It tackles one of the most pressing issues in today’s digital landscape: online privacy. Centralised VPNs often compromise user security and restrict data access. Qubetics introduces a decentralised VPN (dVPN) that offers secure, private, and unrestricted internet usage. Think about it—how often have you worried about your data being exploited or your privacy being breached? Qubetics ensures you don’t have to. For better guidance, please watch this video . Why Qubetics Is a Game-Changer Blockchain scalability has always been a headache. Qubetics’ infrastructure ensures seamless transaction processing without bottlenecks, something many predecessors failed to achieve. Blockchain apps can feel like rocket science to newcomers. Qubetics simplifies this with intuitive tools like the QubeQode IDE, making blockchain tech accessible to developers and users alike. Crypto analysts have set high expectations for Qubetics, with potential prices of $10-$15 after the mainnet launch. For perspective, a $1,000 investment at the presale price of $0.0311 could net over $300,000 if these predictions hold true. Qubetics isn’t just another crypto project; it’s a practical solution to real-world problems. And with its presale success, it’s clear the market sees its potential. Cardano: The Eco-Friendly Blockchain Leader Cardano, often called the “green blockchain,” has been a market favourite for years. Its unique Proof-of-Stake mechanism offers an energy-efficient alternative to Bitcoin’s energy-hungry Proof-of-Work system. But that’s not all—Cardano’s smart contract functionality continues to attract developers, making it one of the most versatile platforms out there. Recent updates suggest a bright future. According to Binance, Cardano’s developments include faster transaction speeds and enhanced decentralisation. Analysts predict a potential rally that could make ADA a hot pick for 2025. But will it outperform Qubetics? Only time will tell. Fantom: The Fast and Scalable Blockchain Fantom has been making waves with its high-speed, low-cost blockchain solutions. Known for its Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology, Fantom provides near-instant transaction finality, making it an attractive option for developers and enterprises. Crypto-News-Flash recently highlighted Fantom’s potential to deliver 100x gains, especially with the growing interest in DeFi and AI integrations. However, scalability remains a challenge for Fantom, and projects like Qubetics could steal the spotlight with more comprehensive solutions. Conclusion While Cardano and Fantom offer compelling features, Qubetics is carving a niche by solving fundamental issues like online privacy, scalability, and accessibility. Its decentralised VPN (dVPN) and user-friendly QubeQode IDE set it apart in a crowded market. The presale numbers speak for themselves—over 305 million tokens sold and counting. With analysts predicting prices of $10-$15 post-mainnet launch, there’s undeniable potential for life-changing gains. A $1,000 investment today could redefine your portfolio by 2025. So, are you ready to secure your slice of the future? Don’t miss out—join the Qubetics revolution before the presale ends. Invest in Qubetics Today and be part of the next crypto success story!

37523503,https://cryptonews.com/?p=318744,1733959800,South Korean Court Upholds Hancom ‘Altcoin Slush Fund’ Scion’s 3-Year Jail Term,"The South Korean High Court has upheld the jail term of the son of the CEO of software giant Hancom after the latter was found guilty of creating a $6.7 million altcoin “slush fund.” Suwon District Court sentenced Kim Sang-cheol’s second son (first name withheld for legal reasons) to jail for three years in August this year. Exec Fostered Altcoin Slush Fund, Prosecutors Explain The younger Kim appealed the verdict at the High Court. But his legal team failed to convince the court to change his sentence. He was found guilty of conspiring with Arowana Tech, an IT startup that had received substantial Hancom backing, to create a slush fund using the former’s Arowana (ARW) tokens. The District Court found the younger Kim guilty of breach of trust violations under the Specific Economic Crime Aggravated Punishment Act. A branch of the Suwon District Court. (Source: Yonhap TV News/YouTube/Screenshot) The same court also sentenced a 48-year-old Arowana Tech executive surnamed Jeong to two and a half years in prison. iNews24 reported that the Suwon High Court’s Criminal Division dismissed appeals from the younger Kim and Jeong’s legal teams on December 11. It also dismissed counterarguments from the prosecution, who asked the court to extend the jail sentences. Prosecutors had also also asked the High Court to impose further fines on the duo. The presiding High Court judge said: “It is hard to say that the District Court’s sentencing was anything other than reasonable. And there appears to be no reason to change the sentence. We cannot accept the arguments from the defendants and the prosecution.” Main opposition set to file new motion to impeach Yoon over martial law declaration https://t.co/WqEVdqOf2P — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) December 11, 2024 Price Manipulation Accusations Prosecutors had hoped to extend the younger Kim’s jail sentence to nine years, and Jeong’s to six years. The prosecution service also accused Hancom With, Hancom’s blockchain arm, of conspiring with Arowana Tech to “manipulate” ARW prices. Prosecutors claimed that the defendants traded Arowana tokens between 2021 and 2022 to raise money for the “slush fund.” The coin rose in value suddenly on April 20, 2021, after it was listed on domestic crypto exchanges. It has since been delisted, but its meteoric x1,075 rise drew immediate suspicion from investigators. The token’s price shot up from $0.035 to just under $38 within the space of just 30 minutes after it was listed. The prosecution has argued that the younger Kim “and others” had “the authority” to “withdraw” ARW tokens. Oh promises safety, festive atmosphere amid mounting tourism concerns https://t.co/yK6ayxhAKj — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) December 11, 2024 NFT Spending Spree It also said the defendants “violated their official duties” and used the slush funds to buy NFTs , invest in stocks, pay off credit card bills, and buy goods in department stores. The prosecution is also hopeful of bringing the senior Kim to trial. In July, the service applied for an arrest warrant . But a court dismissed the application. The ruling judge explained that the senior Kim did not “pose a flight risk.” Korea's rich and powerful families are facing a revolt of their own as the country reels from the political fallout over a brief martial law.

The firm has repeatedly denied that it has “anything to do with the slush fund scandal.” Kim Yeon-soo is reportedly “pushing for management reform,” and iNews24 noted, hopes to “reorganize the firm’s board of directors.” Hancom’s core business is software development.

According to a Proof of Workforce X post, the Kenya National Fire Brigades Association (KENFIBA) has completed setting up its Bitcoin (BTC) reserve. That move makes KENFIBA the country’s pioneering workers’ body to have BTC on its balance sheet. It may also be the first labor union to hold a BTC reserve in Africa. BTC reserve will enhance Kenya’s firefighting capacity KENFIBA pulled off that feat courtesy of “get off zero” funding by Proof of Workforce, a nonprofit that helps workers and their unions invest in BTC. The donor said the crypto fund would help enhance Kenya’s firefighting capacity. The X post read: KENFIBA, The Kenya National Fire Brigades Association, adds Bitcoin onto their balance sheet, becoming the first labor union in Kenya to hold Bitcoin! Potentially, the first labor union on the continent to hold Bitcoin. ~ Proof of Workforce But, one X user, James Otudor challenged Proof of Workforce’s second statement. He held that the Academic Staff Union of a renowned Nigerian University had a BTC reserve before KENFIBA. We couldn’t independently verify Mr Otudor’s claims. What will KENFIBA gain from setting up a BTC reserve? Proof of Workforce’s advisor, Magdalena Gronowska, explained the significance of the collaboration. She said that through it, KENFIBA would enhance its hiring process, member sign-up, and emergency responses. She added that the two institutions had discussed how workers could gain from holding BTC. Also, the deal will see KENFIBA management accessing visionary Bitcoin developers in the country. These BTC developers are local Kenyans who will provide the union and its membership with tools, education, and resources to run the reserve. Africa is making big strides in adopting blockchain, cryptocurrency, and AI technology. That’s evidenced by the growing number of the continent’s governments setting up structures to support the uptake of these evolving technologies. Countries like Egypt, Senegal, Algeria, Rwanda, Benin, and Mauritius have officially sanctioned AI programs. Meanwhile, Kenya, South Africa, and Nigeria, South Africa, are among many that have instituted policies to spur developments in those technological fields.

37523501,https://cryptonews.com/?p=318799,1733958150,Supreme Court Allows Class-Action Lawsuit Against Nvidia Over Crypto Mining Claims,"The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the way for a class-action lawsuit accusing Nvidia of misleading investors about its reliance on crypto mining. The decision came just weeks after the court heard Nvidia’s appeal and days after China announced an antitrust investigation into the chipmaker. Source: supremecourt.gov Crypto Crash Fallout: Nvidia Faces Investor Lawsuit Over Alleged Misstatements On Wednesday, the U.S. Supreme Court announced that it would no longer decide on a lawsuit accusing Nvidia of misrepresenting its reliance on the cryptocurrency mining industry. In a brief unsigned opinion, the court dismissed the case as “improvidently granted,” indicating it was a mistake to take up the matter. No justices dissented from the decision. This dismissal upholds a prior appeals court ruling, which allowed most of the case against Nvidia to proceed. The lawsuit dates back to 2018, when a Swedish investment firm filed the complaint after a downturn in cryptocurrency profitability caused Nvidia’s revenue to fall short of expectations. This led to a 28% drop in the company’s stock value. Investors allege that Nvidia downplayed its reliance on crypto-related revenue, misleading the market. The plaintiffs argue Nvidia misrepresented its reliance on the crypto market, inflating its stock value. Nvidia argued that the lawsuit should be dismissed under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, a law designed to curb baseless securities complaints. The company argued that the plaintiffs failed to meet two key requirements: identifying specific false statements and providing sufficient evidence that company officials knowingly misled investors. While a district court initially dismissed the case, a federal appeals court later reinstated it. The Biden administration supported the plaintiffs, further raising the case’s profile. The Supreme Court’s decision avoids setting a precedent on how the 1995 law should be applied, leaving the appeals court’s interpretation as the guiding standard for now. As a result, the case against Nvidia will proceed. China’s Antitrust Investigation: Will Nvidia’s Growth Face New Roadblocks? The decision resembles a similar move in November when the Supreme Court dismissed a securities fraud case against Facebook. That case centered on allegations that Facebook failed to disclose a data breach that allowed Cambridge Analytica to collect user information. Like the Nvidia case, the dismissal upheld an appeals court ruling, enabling the lawsuit to proceed. In 2022, Nvidia paid the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) a $5.5 million fine to settle charges of failing to disclose that crypto mining was a key driver of revenue growth for its gaming graphics cards. The company did not admit wrongdoing as part of the settlement. Despite the legal challenges, Nvidia remains a dominant force in the technology sector. Its stock price has surged by 180% this year, driven by its leadership in the artificial intelligence market. Nvidia’s chips are essential for training and running AI systems, making it a crucial player in the industry. Adding to Nvidia’s challenges, China recently launched an antitrust investigation into the company. The probe raises questions about potential violations of Chinese antimonopoly laws, intensifying scrutiny as Nvidia continues its rapid growth. This lawsuit is part of a broader trend of high-profile class-action cases against tech companies. The Supreme Court recently dismissed another appeal by Meta, Facebook’s parent company, which sought to block a multibillion-dollar class-action lawsuit over privacy breaches related to the Cambridge Analytica scandal.

In a new filing, the regulatory agency says it’s seeking comments from the public on Bitwise’s new exchange-traded fund (ETF), which would hold a combination of Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ), to advance its application. “Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing, including whether the proposed rule change is consistent with the [law].” In a thread on the social media platform X, Bitwise stated its goal with the dual ETP was to simultaneously give traders easy access to the two biggest digital assets by market cap. “NYSE Arca filed to list a Bitwise ETP that would hold both spot Bitcoin and Ether, weighted by market cap. The goal: give investors balanced exposure to the two largest crypto assets in the world in an easy-to-access format.” Spot market ETFs allow investors to expose themselves to specific assets, such as precious metals or crypto, without the need to actually purchase them. In the filing, the SEC notes that the new ETP “will operate in materially the same manner as the Spot Bitcoin ETPs and Spot Ether ETPs previously approved by the Commission.” Bitwise first announced its plan to launch a BTC and ETH ETF in November when it filed an S-1 registration statement with the SEC. BTC and ETH are trading for $100,786 and $3,890 at time of writing respectively.

Recently, a prominent Wall Street analyst predicted a massive pump for the XRP price to reach $7 in short succession. This optimistic outlook extends to WallitIQ (WLTQ) , as the Wall Street analyst also predicts an outstanding surge from its current presale price of $0.0243 to $40 during this bull run. WallitIQ (WLTQ): Crypto Wallet Set For Explosive Growth In The Bull Run WallitIQ (WLTQ) is a decentralized crypto wallet that gives users total control over their digital assets. Poised to make an outstanding jump from $0.0243 to reach the $40 mark, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has caught the attention of both retail and institutional investors looking to make outstanding gains during this bull run. An outstanding approach of WallitIQ (WLTQ) that has attracted Wall Street analysts is its adoption of AI solutions and machine learning algorithms that aim to promote decentralization, financial literacy, and security for users. The Wall Street analyst strongly believes that WallitIQ (WLTQ) is significantly positioned to benefit from the billion-dollar crypto wallet and AI market, giving investors more room to grow their wealth during this bull run. In addition to the Wall Street analyst predictions of WallitIQ (WLTQ) reaching $40, smart investors are looking forward to participating in blockchain activities like yield farming, trading of over 2,000 cryptocurrencies, and staking mechanisms that yield an annual percentage of 180% for token holders. Also, early investors who are joining the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale will have access to governance participation, premium features, and early gains of up to 100% due to token price increases in the next stage of the presale. The ongoing WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale has experienced massive success, raising millions of dollars within a few weeks. This early presale success mirrors investors’ confidence in WallitIQ’s growth potential and advanced features during this bull run. For instance, global merchants are rapidly adopting WallitIQ’s decentralized wallet for its scan-and-pay QR functionality, which eliminates errors and saves time during transactions. While XRP price is positioned to reach $7, the ongoing WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale is getting all the action as millions of investors continue to buy WLTQ tokens in this bull run. With a projected $10 million in monthly revenue, early joiners are in a better position to earn significantly from WallitIQ’s $0.0243 to $40 surge.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Analysts predict XRP could see a 24,544% ROI, potentially hitting $589, while PropiChain’s presale is 94% sold out, sparking excitement. Table of Contents XRP price rally: 24,544% ROI in the horizon PropiChain: The hidden altcoin that could outshine XRP’s 24,544% gains PropiChain presale: Limited time offer Analysts have predicted that the XRP price surge could jump to 24,544% ROI, creating excitement in the crypto space. That’s not all; experts predict that the XRP price could increase, potentially reaching a new all-time high of $589. However, a new altcoin is also capturing investor interest. PropiChain promises to double on XRP’s gains and offers revolutionary features to redefine the trillion-dollar real estate industry. As PropiChain gains momentum, the stage 1 presale has already sold out 94% of its tokens, setting the stage for an explosive future. You might also like: PropiChain’s token presale surges as investors seek 10,000x gains XRP price rally: 24,544% ROI in the horizon A recent analysis by Crypto expert Cryptobilbuwoo0 signals a strong rally for XRP price driven by the token’s impressive performance since early November. XRP price has jumped through several critical levels, including $0.64, $0.915, $1.13, and $1.612, signaling an upward trajectory. Similarly, experts forecast that XRP price could reach an ambitious target of $6.25 and $26.6 shortly. Predictions show that the XRP price could jump further to $50, $113.13, and even $589 if it maintains the bullish momentum. This prediction has boosted investor confidence in the future potential of XRP price. Regulatory clarity could further boost the XRP price performance. Consequently, if the XRP’s SEC litigation is resolved, a similar growth will follow, making XRP a great player in the crypto market. The XRP price is $2.25 at press time, just 35% of its all-time high. If the token breaks out beyond this level, XRP price could surge even higher, cementing XRP’s place in the current crypto bull run. PropiChain: The hidden altcoin that could outshine XRP’s 24,544% gains While the XRP price is undeniably impressive, PropiChain is garnering investor attention with the potential to deliver double the returns of XRP. PropiChain is breaking barriers in the blockchain space with its unique solutions for the trillion-dollar real estate market. By addressing real-world problems in property investment and management, PropiChain stands out in the crypto market. At the heart of PropiChain’s value proposition is fractional property ownership, which democratizes access to the lucrative real estate market. PropiChain users can purchase a fraction of high-end properties to diversify their portfolios and access lucrative investments without hefty capital requirements. Again, PropiChain stands out for its automated valuation models that offer accurate valuation of properties. This enables investors to buy or sell properties at fair market value. Accurate property valuations reduce risks to buyers and sellers. Also, PropiChain integrates artificial intelligence to help investors make informed decisions. The platform provides real-time market analysis and property valuations, which makes it easy for investors to jump on emerging opportunities. Adding to its appeal, PropiChain integrates with the Metaverse to create a futuristic immersive experience for users. Using the Metaverse, investors can take virtual tours of potential investment properties and walk through them from their homes. This breaks down geographical barriers while giving investors a firsthand view of a prospective asset. Security and trust is the cornerstone of PropiChain’s architecture. Similarly, BlockAudit has thoroughly audited the platform’s smart contract to confirm it’s free from vulnerabilities. Similarly, investors are assured that the platform adheres to high-security standards. Again, the recent listing of PropiChain on CoinMarketCap enhances the credibility and accessibility of the token. Similarly, for the token to be listed on a prominent platform like CoinMarketCap is a great milestone, which shows that the best is yet to come. PropiChain presale: Limited time offer As the XRP price prepares for a historic rally, PropiChain emerges as a token that can double those gains. With a groundbreaking approach to real estate and unmatched ROI potential, PropiChain is the next big thing in crypto. The PropiChain presale is a golden opportunity for early investors, with 94% of tokens already sold out, raising over $1.3 million in the first round. The tokens are priced at $0.004, the lowest it will ever be, signaling the perfect time for you to secure a position in this revolutionary project. If someone invests an initial investment of $1,000, their investment will be worth almost $500,000 upon hitting the target price. As the demand increases and the Stage 1 presale nears completion, this rare opportunity to invest at such a low price quickly slips away.

37522712,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=626159,1733957868,Whales buy Bitcoin and XRP dip as bull cycle shows resilience,"Technical analyst Ali Martinez has said that the drop in crypto prices has allowed whales to accumulate more assets. In a post on X, Martinez reported that 342 new wallets holding more than 100 BTC were created as Bitcoin dipped from $104,000 to around $90,000. According to Martinez, whales are buying every dip as a sign of their strong bullishness about Bitcoin. He added that the price correction is merely a test of investors’ resilience, and those who took advantage are best positioned to ride the next wave. He said : “This correction is a test of resilience, and if you play it right, you’ll be positioned to ride the next wave. This is how the 1% operates—buying fear while the rest of the market hesitates.” Meanwhile, whales’ acquisition during the dip is not completely surprising. Crypto analyst Mac_D observed that Coinbase Premium surged while the Bitcoin price fell. Coinbase Premium describes the percentage difference between the price of BTC on Coinbase Pro and Binance, usually indicating the time when US institutional investors are buying. The rebound in the Premium implies that US investors buy heavily when there are massive sell-offs on Binance. Bitcoin Coinbase Premium surged as price fell – (Source: CryptoQuant) The analyst noted: “This rebound suggests that when excessive panic selling occurs on Binance, which has a higher proportion of small investors, U.S. institutional investors are likely to adopt an aggressive buying strategy.” Interestingly, Bitcoin is not the only asset investors bought because of its dip. Onchain data also show that whales bought more than 100 million XRP as the token price fell due and retail sold in panic. Analysts predictions come true as crypto prices rebound Meanwhile, the dip now appears to be over for now, as almost every crypto asset has seen a surge in price over the last 24 hours. Bitcoin which fell as low as around $94,000 is now back above $101,000 after over 6% increase in its value. With the rise in Bitcoin price, every other major cap token has followed, with XRP seeing the most gains in 24 hours at 18%, according to CoinMarketCap. SOL also increased by 10%, while BNB, DOGE, and ADA added 5%, 8%, and 13%, respectively. Most analysts who predicted the rebound were not surprised. According to Santiment analysts on December 10, the FUD among traders who expect Bitcoin to drop below $90,000 is a positive sign of incoming retail capitulation. This is a good sign, as prices tend to move against market expectations. They wrote: “FUD is beginning to appear amongst traders. With some calls for $80K-$89K appearing across social media from the crowd once again, take this as a positive sign that retail capitulation is returning. Prices move the opposite direction of crowd expectation, meaning fear is generally necessary for prices to rebound.” However, Cryptoquant founder Ki Young Ju explained the quick rebound, noting that price corrections for BTC will be relatively small in this bull cycle. He attributes this to steady demand from institutions and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This has been the least volatile Bitcoin bull cycle (Source: Glassnode) Glassnode data also supports this, with analysts noting that the average drawdown since 2022 is -7.68% compared to -16.24% overall. The maximum drawdown for this cycle is only -26.25%, far smaller than the -71.15% between 2011 and 2013. This shows that this cycle has been the least volatile for Bitcoin. Bitcoin bull cycle expected to last longer as distribution continues With Bitcoin returning to over $100,000 again, there are already some concerns about how long the good times will last. Experts at Glassnode believe the bull cycle is still in the mid-to-late stage with the potential for more price increases. They noted that cyclical long-term holders (LTH), excluding the ultra LTH who have held for over seven years, now have less than 50% of the BTC supply. Generally, these LTHs hold the majority of BTC at the beginning of the bull cycle, and by the peak, their supply has dropped, and short-term holders (STH) have around 70% – 80%. Although the ETFs have changed the dynamics to some extent, STH still only holds around 50%, far below the over 80% they had when the market peaked in 2021. However, the level of distribution has increased over the last 30 days, with the Long/Short-Term Holder Supply Ratio dropping to 3.78, which is the lowest it’s been this cycle. The decline in the Mean Investment Age suggests the Bull Cycle is still on – (Source: Santiment) Meanwhile, Santiment data shows that the Mean Dollar Invested Age has been declining. This metric, which determines how long a wallet has held an asset, has fallen 31% in 60 weeks for Bitcoin, 22% in 14 weeks for XRP, and 31% in eight weeks for Dogecoin. The fact that coins in wallets are getting younger means that there is distribution, and historically, a bull market only ends when the mean age starts increasing.

Here's Why This New Crypto Is Set To Outshine Shiba Inu,"A Dogecoin rally is reigniting excitement among crypto enthusiasts as DOGE signals bullish patterns ahead of the anticipated Santa rally. Dogecoin eyes a potential 300% surge this December, but a new crypto quietly positions itself to outshine even Shiba Inu. Combining tangible utility with market-defying growth, this emerging contender could redefine the GambleFi landscape. A New Crypto Challenges the Meme Coin Giants While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu rally on historical patterns and ecosystem updates, a new cryptois quietly emerging as a force to be reckoned with. Leveraging innovative utility and a unique value proposition, this rising star is poised to disrupt the crypto markets globally. This project, built on a GambleFi ecosystem, delivers immediate rewards through weekly profit distributions. Unlike Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, this new crypto doesn’t rely on speculative sentiment but offers tangible returns. With its presale already raising over $7 million and tokens priced at just $0.041, early investors are seizing the opportunity. Deflationary tokenomics, which burn 60% of repurchased tokens while redistributing 40% to stakers, ensure sustainable growth and consistent returns. These features set the stage for this new crypto to not only compete with but potentially outshine meme coin giants. Dogecoin’s Momentum Points to a December Breakout Analysts draw comparisons between this Dogecoin rally and its remarkable 2017 December surge of over 300%. Currently trading at $0.404, DOGE has seen an impressive 60% rise over the past month. If the price breaks above $0.44, analysts believe it could pave the way for a move to $0.50, with the $1 mark potentially within reach by early 2025. December has historically been a favorable month for Dogecoin, with an average gain of 24.3%. This trend further supports optimism for the weeks ahead. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for DOGE currently stands at 63, signaling continued bullish momentum. Additionally, analysts emphasize Bitcoin’s performance as a critical factor; the break above $100,000 for BTC could amplify enthusiasm across the crypto market, benefiting Dogecoin significantly. Adding to this optimism are whale activities and growing speculation about a potential DogecoinETF in 2025. Shiba Inu Builds Strength Amid Ecosystem Updates A bullish triangle pattern fueled a rise for SHIB and the anticipated Shibarium update promises to further bolster its ecosystem. On-chain data reveals that a significant portion of SHIB holders remain profitable, indicating strong investor confidence. This minimizes the likelihood of panic selling, even in the face of market fluctuations. Analysts highlight $0.000035 as a crucial resistance level, with a potential breakout unlocking further price growth. Meanwhile, the Shibarium update, designed to enhance security and scalability, positions SHIBas a competitive force in the meme coin sector. Despite its recent rally, overbought conditions—reflected in an RSI of 73—suggest a possible consolidation phase before the next upward movement. Balancing Speculation and Utility The Dogecoin rally and Shiba Inu’s bullish momentum highlight the meme coin sector's enduring appeal. However, the rise of this new crypto introduces a fresh dimension—combining immediate financial rewards with long-term value. For investors seeking to diversify their portfolios, the current market offers a spectrum of opportunities: Dogecoin for historical momentum, Shiba Inu for ecosystem growth, and this new crypto for innovative utility. Together, these projects define the evolving dynamics of the crypto market, offering both speculative gains and sustainable returns.

Pepe Loves Santa (PEPESAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPESAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Loves Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Loves Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Loves Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Loves Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Loves Santa by entering its contract address – 9FuN9o4pQgF3NF1v2saWvb7b9hNKDJ1DGU6LSbur437Q – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPESAN.

In July, Negrete, who was the vice mayor at the time, led the campaign that established the office. During the Santa Monica City Council meeting held on July 9, the council unanimously approved 7-0 to establish a Santa Monica Bitcoin Office program at zero cost to the city. Lana Negrete highlighted that establishing the office was not about the asset itself or the commodity but about promoting Bitcoin education in the city and exploring industry partnerships, unemployment creation, and economic recovery. The office was set up by the now-appointed mayor in collaboration with Proof of Workforce, which manages the office from a non-profit perspective. Lana has joined a pro-crypto administration headed by President-elect Donald Trump. Trump appoints pro-crypto candidates in his administration Trump has already made several appointments involving pro-crypto candidates in major regulatory offices to form part of his administration. The appointments come as preparation made by the president-elect to deliver on the promises he made for the crypto community. Perhaps the most notable nomination was the one involving the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chairperson. The president-elect announced on Truth Social that he had appointed Paul Atkins to be the next chair after Gary Gensler, who has officially resigned. Trump’s running mate and soon-to-be Vice President, JD Vance, is also renowned for being a crypto enthusiast. The 40-year-old has Bitcoin holdings worth between $250,000 and $500,000, according to CBS News . Trump also recently appointed former PayPal Chief Operating Officer David Sacks to serve as the “White House A.I. & Crypto Czar.” The appointment marked another significant step towards transforming U.S. policies in the technology space. The role will involve regulatory oversight of the crypto industry. Sacks reportedly owns digital assets such as Solana. His venture capital fund, Craft, has also exposed itself to the cryptocurrency space by investing in crypto companies Bitwise and BitGo. Trump also named Elon Musk the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, a department he created to control government spending and reduce wastage of resources. Musk is a well-known cryptographic figure. He is known to endorse the popular memecoin Dogecoin and once accepted crypto payments from Tesla buyers. According to Bitcoin Treasuries, his companies, Tesla and SpaceX , own 9,720 Bitcoin and 8,285 Bitcoin, respectively. Musk will work hand in hand with Howard Lutnick, who is also a major player in the crypto ecosystem. His firm, Cantor Fitzgerald, has managed Tether’s U.S. Treasury and bond portfolios since 2021.

The change follows his departure from Consensys, where he played an important role in advancing Ethereum’s ecosystem. Given Resnick’s strong ties to Ethereum and growing enthusiasm for Solana, this unexpected decision has sparked debate in the cryptocurrency community. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bet For Amazon? 5% Stake Proposal Raises Eyebrows Resnick wrote a blog post outlining his motivation for joining Solana, emphasizing his wish to become knowledgeable about the protocol’s main components, including consensus processes and fee markets. He clarified, “I want to get up to speed on the implementation details as soon as possible,” adding that his work might open the door for others to eventually help Solana flourish. Last week was my last week at Consensys. Today is my first day at @anza_xyz. I’m taking my talents to Solana. In my first 100 days, I plan on writing a spec for as much of the Solana protocol as I can get to, prioritizing fee markets and consensus implementations where I… — Max Resnick (@MaxResnick1) December 9, 2024 Focus On Collaboration And Innovation Resnick’s decision was not solely about Solana’s technology; he also emphasized the important work of Anza, a Solana-focused R&D firm. He applauded Anza’s behind-the-scenes efforts, namely its contributions to network enhancements. “Those of you in Eth land may not have heard much from them, but they’ve been quietly shipping major improvements to the network over the past year,” Resnick pointed out. Resnick hasn’t completely given up Ethereum despite his transformation. Working as a Research Fellow at Consensys, he will keep providing advise and support. Resnick’s dual function suggests that he aims to cross knowledge between two important blockchain environments, therefore benefiting both communities over time. Solana Price Momentum Positive confidence has helped Solana’s market performance to progressively get better. SOL has risen 5.9%, to $225 within the past 24 hours. The altcoin has surged sharply since early November, surpassing levels of crucial resistance. SOL’s value jumped 215% during the past year, suggesting rising investor confidence. The slow rise in price suggests stronger technical structure and more market use. Analysts predict Solana’s momentum will keep on, especially with well-known people like Resnick on its development team. #Solana $SOL will hit $4,000, based on this cup and handle pattern! pic.twitter.com/dXZLI9urOh — Ali (@ali_charts) December 10, 2024 Related Reading: HBAR To Hit $100?

37521821,https://thecoinrise.com/bernstein-sees-microstrategy-boom-post-nasdaq-100-addition/,1733956227,Bernstein Sees MicroStrategy Boom Post Nasdaq 100 Addition,"MicroStrategy, a well-known business intelligence company and a major holder of Bitcoin, is likely to see rapid growth. Analysts at Bernstein say this growth will come from the possibility of MicroStrategy being added to the Nasdaq 100 index and the positive signals from the new Trump administration, which is expected to support cryptocurrency strongly. MicroStrategy to Experience Mind-Blowing Growth Likewise, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart, in a post on X, predicts that MicroStrategy will join the Nasdaq 100 on December 23. This addition could greatly increase the company’s visibility and lead to significant buying activity. Seyffart estimates that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) related to the index will buy at least $2.1 billion of MicroStrategy shares. This purchase would account for about 20% of the stock’s daily trading volume, which Seyffart considers a conservative estimate. Notably, MicroStrategy’s addition to the Nasdaq 100 index would be a significant achievement for the company, highlighting its growing role in technology and cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, this potential increase comes as the market expects more supportive policies for crypto under the Trump administration. With clearer regulations and support for innovation, crypto-focused companies like MicroStrategy will likely benefit from this positive trend. MicroStrategy Bitcoin Bet Deepens MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy continues to draw attention as Bernstein analysts project the firm’s holdings could swell to 4% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply by 2033. The research firm updated its price target for MicroStrategy’s stock (MSTR) to $600 by the end of 2025, citing its unprecedented treasury model and increasing global capital inflows. Notably, this report highlights MicroStrategy’s success in raising $3 billion in convertible debt and $6.6 billion in equity, putting the company ahead of its $42 billion capital-raising plan. The analysts view this as a pivotal factor in MicroStrategy’s ability to sustain its long-term Bitcoin acquisition strategy . MicroStrategy, a Pacesetter in the Crypto Industry The tech giant has emerged as a pioneering force in the cryptocurrency industry , primarily through its bold investment strategy focused on Bitcoin. The company has been recognized as one of the largest corporate holders of cryptocurrency. MicroStrategy has set a precedent for other companies considering similar Bitcoin acquisition moves. However, naysayers mentioned that MicroStrategy’s strategy is no longer unique and mentioned Metaplanet, which also holds significant Bitcoin reserves . They also said that other major industry players and countries are signaling interest in the digital asset, which potentially hints at future shifts in market dynamics.

37521719,https://nulltx.com/?p=135574,1733956222,"Best Meme Coins to Invest in This Week: BTFD, Goatseus Maximus, and Moo Deng","Best Meme Coins to Invest in This Week: BTFD’s Presale Rockets Past $3.4M in Days While Goatseus Maximus and Moo Deng Making Waves! What if this week could be your golden ticket to catching the next big thing in crypto? With meme coins taking the stage, the buzz around Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) and Moo Deng (MOODENG) has hit a fever pitch. GOAT is riding waves of market momentum, and MOODENG is making headlines with its Coinbase listing and viral cultural roots. But the real showstopper? BTFD Coin (BTFD), with a live Play-to-Earn (P2E) game and a presale that’s already smashing records. The opportunities here aren’t just good—they’re game-changing. BTFD Coin is rewriting the playbook for meme coins. It’s in its 11th presale stage, has already sold over 50 billion coins, and raised a whopping $3.4 million. With staking rewards and a thriving community of over 4,400 holders, this project is set to be a headline-maker. And the timing couldn’t be better—BTFD’s P2E game beta version is live now, giving you a chance to enjoy while the market prepares for its next big move. Let’s dive into why BTFD and its competitors are the best meme coins to invest in this week. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Revolution That’s Changing the Game Imagine snagging an investment that feels like being at the start of a bull run. That’s what BTFD Coin promises, with its presale currently in its 11th stage, setting the stage for what could be the next big meme coin explosion. The BTFD Revolution and Live P2E Game At its heart, BTFD represents the “ Buy the Dip ” mantra, turning market downturns into opportunities. But this isn’t just another coin with a catchy slogan. BTFD’s live P2E game is here. It’s not just a game; it’s a gateway to BTFD’s ecosystem, where earnings can be staked for even greater returns. The project is built on Ethereum, guaranteeing security, liquidity, and scalability. With over 5,000 active nodes, Ethereum’s network ensures transparency, making BTFD an ideal investment for those seeking stability in the meme coin space. Presale Highlights and Growth Potential Here’s the kicker: the BTFD presale has already raised over $3.4 million, selling more than 50 billion tokens to over 4,400 investors. Starting at just $0.000004, the presale price is now $0.00012, with a projected listing price of $0.0006. Early adopters stand to gain massive returns—if you invest $1,500 in this stage, your holdings could be worth $7,500 once the coin hits its listing price. With 173 billion tokens in total supply, BTFD ensures scarcity and demand. Add to that a staking APY of 90%, and you’ve got a recipe for steady growth. If you’ve missed out on past bull runs, BTFD offers a second chance to ride the wave. Goatseus Maximus (GOAT): Meme Meets Market Momentum GOAT is the meme coin that’s been shaking up the crypto scene, blending humour with serious potential. Recently, it gained 15%, reaching $0.86 before stabilising at $0.69. Its association with the AI bot Truth Terminal and OpenAI’s $1.5 billion SoftBank deal added an unexpected boost. Challenges and Opportunities Despite the price rally, GOAT faces hurdles. Truth Terminal’s treasury migration raised concerns among investors, affecting its price trajectory. But analysts suggest that if the Relative Strength Index (RSI) hits 30, indicating an oversold market, GOAT could bounce back. Its all-time high of $1.35 in November 2024 shows the coin’s potential for recovery. As an investor, it’s a good idea to keep an eye on these developments. GOAT’s journey may be volatile, but its resilience makes it a strong contender in the meme coin space. Moo Deng (MOODENG): From Viral Sensation to Crypto Success MOODENG takes meme coins to a whole new level with its origin story—a baby pygmy hippo from Thailand that went viral. Its cultural impact, combined with strategic moves like a Coinbase listing, has made MOODENG a hot topic. Cultural Hype Meets Market Gains When Coinbase announced its plans to list MOODENG, the coin surged by 80%, hitting $0.57 before stabilising at $0.5159. Its current price of $0.00010463 might seem modest, but with a market cap of $350.94 million, the coin has solid footing. Investors are closely watching key support at $0.5006 and resistance at $0.6531. MOODENG’s largest whale recently added 11.8 million tokens, a clear sign of confidence in the coin’s potential. Conclusion From Goatseus Maximus’s resilience to Moo Deng’s viral fame, and the groundbreaking BTFD presale, these coins are rewriting the rules of meme investing. Based on market trends and their unique offerings, BTFD stands out as the best meme coin to invest in this week. Its presale performance, staking rewards, and live P2E game are unmatched.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Analyzing three hidden gems that could surge by 9,000% in December’s bull market. Table of Contents CYBRO aims for 1000% growth after raising $7M AVAX: Low fees and high throughput Chainlink: Smart contracts and secure real-world data Conclusion As December progresses, the cryptocurrency market teems with fresh opportunities. Amid countless digital currencies, three obscure altcoins are drawing attention for their exceptional growth potential. These hidden gems could see their values surge by nearly 9,000% this bull market. CYBRO aims for 1000% growth after raising $7M CYBRO, an AI-powered multichain marketplace, is approaching a pivotal moment with its Token Generation Event (TGE). Following a fast presale that raised $7 million and attracted nearly 20,000 investors, CYBRO is set to list on Gate.io and other major exchanges on December 14th. During the presale, CYBRO experienced a 450% price surge, climbing from $0.01 to $0.055. The token’s listing at $0.06 has already generated immense demand, with many experts predicting a potential 1000% growth as it enters the open market, driven by strong momentum and solid fundamentals. CYBRO seamlessly combines advanced AI with a user-friendly DeFi platform, providing tools for staking, farming, and lending that cater to both cautious beginners and experienced investors. Its presale accomplishments highlight its quick development and transformative features: CYBRO app: Offering over 30 vaults with competitive APYs to match a variety of investment strategies. Blast Index: A one-click investment solution that simplifies DeFi participation by integrating with lending protocols. Robust platform foundation: Creating a seamless and intuitive user experience for investors. CYBRO’s plans extend through 2025, including advanced features like leverage farming, lending aggregators, and smarter AI tools. These developments aim to solidify its position as a transformative player in the decentralized finance space. As CYBRO prepares for its market debut, the momentum from its presale and novel features position it as a token to watch. Interested investors can still join CYBRO before the listing . AVAX: Low fees and high throughput AVAX is the native token of Avalanche, a Layer-1 blockchain known for low fees and efficient transactions. Avalanche can process up to 4,500 transactions per second, using a hybrid consensus mechanism combining Classical and Nakamoto principles. Avalanche has three chains: X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain. These chains handle different operations like transactions and smart contracts. The platform also allows users to create custom blockchains called subnets. AVAX has utility in payments, staking, and enabling the creation of custom tokens and blockchains. Chainlink: Smart contracts and secure real-world data Chainlink is a decentralized network that connects smart contracts with real-world data. It allows blockchain applications to interact with external data sources, APIs, and systems securely. Chainlink uses a reputation system to ensure data accuracy and reliability. By bridging blockchain and external data, it enhances the capabilities of smart contracts. The network operates through a three-step process: Oracles retrieve data, aggregate to confirm accuracy, and deliver securely to smart contracts. Chainlink also combines on-chain and off-chain components for efficient data processing. The LINK token is central to the Chainlink ecosystem, rewarding data providers, supporting staking for security, and serving as payment for services. This design promotes a reliable and decentralized system. Conclusion In the current bull market, AVAX and LINK offer growth prospects but may have limited short-term potential. In contrast, CYBRO stands out as a promising opportunity for investors aiming for significant returns. The advanced DeFi platform will use AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain to enhance earnings. It will also provide attractive staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases. CYBRO users will enjoy seamless deposits and withdrawals, ensuring a smooth experience. With a strong emphasis on transparency, compliance, and quality, CYBRO has drawn substantial interest from major crypto investors and influencers. Its unique approach positions it as a compelling choice in today’s dynamic market. To learn more about CYBRO, visit their website , Twitter , Discord , or Telegram .

37521437,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=374285,1733955755,New Crypto Scam Uses Fake Influencer Accounts to Lure Victims Into Telegram Malware Trap,"A new wave of crypto scams has emerged, with attackers using fake X accounts to impersonate popular influencers and lure unsuspecting users into fraudulent Telegram groups. Users are then manipulated into installing malware that compromises crypto wallet data. Scammers Moving Beyond Simple Phishing Scams According to blockchain security firm Scam Sniffer, the scammers comment on legitimate posts, enticing users with offers of exclusive investment insights and “alpha” tips. Once individuals join these Telegram groups, they are immediately prompted to undergo a verification process via a bot called OfficiaISafeguardBot. The bot creates a false sense of urgency and pushes users to quickly complete the verification. However, this seemingly harmless step is a trap – by completing the verification, the bot injects malicious PowerShell code into the user’s clipboard. When executed, the code downloads malware designed to compromise the system and steal sensitive data, including crypto wallet information. Scam Sniffer said that the malware has been flagged by VirusTotal as harmful, and previous instances of similar attacks have resulted in private key theft, leading to significant financial losses. “This represents a new evolution in crypto scams – moving beyond simple phishing to combine social engineering with malware. Stay vigilant and share this to protect others.” Rampant Scams Last month, Casa CEO Nick Neuman shared a harrowing tale of a phishing scam that targeted him. In a post on X, Neuman described a call he received from a scammer pretending to be a Coinbase support agent. The scammer claimed that Neuman’s password change request had been canceled and encouraged him to click on a link in a suspicious email. When Neuman started questioning the scammer, they dropped the act and revealed the operation’s true nature. The scammer bragged about having recently stolen $35,000 from a victim and made it clear that the scam targets only rich crypto investors. More recently, a crypto user under the pseudonym “LeftsideEmiri,” reported losing $300,000 due to a social engineering attack. According to the user, the attack began when they received a message containing a link to a KakaoTalk conversation, which was supposedly for a partnership meeting. Although the link seemed broken, the user clicked on it, believing it to be harmless. In hindsight, they suspect that clicking the link triggered the installation of malware, which compromised their Ethereum and Solana wallets, along with several other wallets. The user made it clear that they had not approved or signed any transactions, indicating that the attack was covert and took advantage of social engineering techniques to steal funds.

This technology will use the Avalanche ( AVAX ) blockchain to create a secure and interactive ticketing system for all events at the 25,000-seat stadium. Speaking to crypto.news, Sports Illustrated Tickets CEO David Lane said Avalanche was selected for this project due to its high speed and scalability. “Avalanche allows for the creation of custom subnets, providing flexibility and control for managing ticketing data,”Lane added. For attendees unfamiliar with blockchain , it helps to think of it as a way to verify and secure digital information. In this case, each ticket becomes a unique digital asset that fans can securely hold in digital wallets. This setup prevents counterfeiting and allows for efficient transfers or resales, providing peace of mind to both buyers and sellers. “Each ticket is a unique, verifiable asset recorded on the blockchain, making duplication impossible,” the SI executive said.

37521533,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=626240,1733955333,"Google launches Gemini 2.0, claims it’s a model for “everything”","Search engine giant Google on Wednesday launched its Gemini 2.0, an experimental model that can use websites on its own and is basically a model “for everything.” According to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, the latest model will enable users to build new AI agents that “bring us closer to our vision of a universal assistant.” The company has described its model as its most “capable model yet built for the agentic era.” The initiatives come as part of the firm’s efforts in the tech industry’s heightened competition against the likes of Meta, Microsoft, and Meta. Google will roll out the model across products Pichai also revealed the latest model, with multimodal capabilities will be rolled out across its products including native image and audio output. The search engine giant launched the Gemini 1.0 in December last year, which Google said was the first “natively multimodal” model, suggesting the model could process and respond to text, video, image, audio, and code enquiries. The latest version represents Google’s latest efforts in the tech industry’s increasingly competitive AI race. “If Gemini 1.0 was about organizing and understanding information, Gemini 2.0 is about making it much more useful.” Pichai. Gemini 2.0 comes nearly 10 months after Google first launched 1.5. The model is still in experimental preview, according to Google, with only one version of the model, the smaller, lower-end 2.0 Flash released. Google DeepMind CEO and head of the company’s AI efforts Demis Hassabis said this still was a big day for the tech giant. “It’s as good as the current Pro model is. So you can think of it as one whole tier better, for the same cost efficiency and performance efficiency and speed. We’re really happy with that,” Hassabis explained. Currently, only developers and testers are the first to get 2.0 while other Gemini users have access to the 2.0 Flash experimental model, which builds off 1.5 Flash, which was launched as the fastest and most cost-effective model. Google announced an array of new features According to the company, it expects to add the new model’s reasoning capabilities to the AI Overviews feature which is now accessible to one billion users, according to Pichai. He has indicated that it is becoming one of the group’s most popular search features. With this new model, Pichai further highlighted that AI Overviews will now be able to tackle complex multi-step queries, for instance, mathematical equations and multimodal questions. While limited testing for the newest model started this week, the reasoning feature will only be accessible to more users early next year. According to Google, the reasoning model runs off the search engine giant’s 6 th -generation AI chip, Trillium, which also became available to Google Cloud customers on Wednesday. In its blog post , Google revealed that the new chip delivers 4 times better performance and is 67% more energy efficient than its predecessor. We’re kicking off the start of our Gemini 2.0 era with Gemini 2.0 Flash, which outperforms 1.5 Pro on key benchmarks at 2X speed (see chart below). I’m especially excited to see the fast progress on coding, with more to come. Developers can try an experimental version in AI… pic.twitter.com/iEAV8dzkaW — Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) December 11, 2024 The Google CEO also announced other features, such as the new Gemini feature known as Deep Research which can act as a research assistant by using advanced reasoning and long context capabilities. This new feature is available in Gemini Advanced and is capable of compiling research reports on behalf of a user. Hassabis said that Gemini 2.0 was laying the foundation for a great 2025. “We really see 2025 as the true start of the agent-based era.” Hassabis. This comes as the company announced the launch of another product, Project Mariner , an experimental new Chrome extension that can literally use a web browser for users. Additionally, Google also announced that Jules – an agent created specifically to help developers find and fix bad code- and a new Gemini 2.0-based agent that can look at users’ screens and help them play video games better. According to Hassabis, the game agent which he calls an “Easter egg” points to it being truly multimodal.

The token is now set to list at $0.06 on major crypto exchanges like Gate.io, with the highly anticipated debut scheduled for December 14th. CYBRO is transforming DeFi accessibility with features such as staking, farming, and lending. The presale marked several key milestones: CYBRO app launch: Live with over 30 vaults offering competitive APYs to cater to diverse investment strategies. Blast Index debut: An intuitive, one-click investment tool integrating seamlessly with lending protocols. Platform growth: Establishing a streamlined, user-centric DeFi ecosystem. With a roadmap extending through 2025, CYBRO aims to introduce advanced features, including leverage farming, lending aggregators, and enhanced AI-powered tools, solidifying its long-term value proposition. CYBRO’s listing comes amid increasing interest in AI-powered financial platforms. Its strong fundamentals, rapid growth, and unique features are drawing attention from both retail and institutional investors. As CYBRO prepares for its market debut, its presale success and accelerated progress signal that this is just the beginning. Investors can still be part of CYBRO before its potential listing frenzy. Solana eyes $296 resistance Solana is currently trading between $207.27 and $230. The nearest resistance level is at $264.92, and a push above this could see SOL testing the next resistance at $296.73. The nearest support is at $201.32, providing a cushion against downward movements. Over the past month, Solana’s price has increased by 5.63%, indicating potential for growth. The 10-day simple moving average is slightly below the current price range, while the 100-day average stands at $223.54. The Relative Strength Index is at 38.02, suggesting the coin is approaching oversold territory. This could imply a possible upward movement if buying pressure increases. POL nears oversold region POL is currently trading between $0.59 and $0.64. In the past month, its price jumped by about 51%, though it fell around 11% this week. The Relative Strength Index is at 37.66, suggesting it’s nearing oversold levels. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is below the 100-day average, hinting at a possible upward turn. If the POL price climbs past the resistance at $0.88, it could reach the next level at $1.08, which would be a significant gain from the current price. On the flip side, if it drops below the support at $0.48, there may be further declines.

The token is near its support level at $11.03, suggesting a possible rebound. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 30.87, indicating that APT is nearing oversold territory. This could lead to a price recovery towards the resistance level at $15.12, offering a notable increase from current levels. However, the MACD is negative at -0.55, pointing to continued bearish momentum. Investors are watching for a price move above the 100-day Simple Moving Average of $14.02, which could signal a shift towards more growth. Cardano at key support levels Cardano has experienced a recent drop, with a 1-week price change of -8.38%. Trading between $0.95 and $1.10, it is approaching the nearest support level at $0.92. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 34.27, indicating that the coin is nearing oversold conditions. The MACD level is negative at -0.039, suggesting continued downward momentum. Despite this, the coin has seen a 1-month gain of 102.41%, showing potential for a rebound. If the price holds above the support level, it could target the nearest resistance at $1.46, offering a possible upward move. Investors are watching these levels closely to assess Cardano’s next direction. Conclusion While established altcoins like SOL, POL, APT, and ADA continue to show promise, their short-term potential appears limited. In contrast, CYBRO emerges as an advanced DeFi platform offering investors opportunities to maximize earnings through AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain. With features such as generous staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases, CYBRO seeks to provide a superior user experience with seamless deposits and withdrawals. By prioritizing transparency, compliance, and quality, CYBRO distinguishes itself as a promising project, attracting significant interest from crypto whales and influencers.

37521150,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=625986,1733954880,Tron Forms Massive Bull Flag After Smashing ATH; Hedera and Lunex Network Continues Upsurge To $1,"From pricing in a bearish and stagnant phase to finally forming a steep flag pole to surpass its ATH, Tron (TRX) has displayed one of the most impressive price movements this year. Its recent growth surge has put it on the radar of cryptos to buy this year. Meanwhile, investors are also paying attention to other top gainers like Hedera (HBAR) which has registered over 500% monthly surge, aiming to hit $1. Similarly, fast-rising presale star, Lunex Network (LNEX) is also headed in the same direction. With an innovative DeFi model and a rapidly progressing presale, Lunex Network is aiming to hit the $1 milestone in record time. Tron Token Makes Headlines As It Smashes ATH Tron (TRX) coin has impressively come out of its long-standing consolidation pattern. However, its breakout is even more parabolic than expected. In the past month, Tron (TRX) has risen by over 88% rising from $0.1 to mark an all-time high of $0.44 in a steep climb. Although, Tron coin has dropped below its ATH price levels, analysts like Caylan have warned that selling Tron out of fear will mean buying it back at a higher rate of $3.5. Amid this lofty speculation, analyst TheJanaNFT also hinted how Tron holds over $62B of the global stablecoin supply, portraying its massive influence in the altcoin market. According to CoinMarketCap , Tron is still 45% up in the past week despite its consolidation, signaling a bullish flag. As Tron rests in a weekly range of $0.20 and $0.42, a potential target above $0.60 lies ahead according to TehLamboX . Hedera Price Sets To Hit $1 As Per Analyst Opinions The price of Hedera has been quite impressive throughout the month. After completing over a 500% surge in the past month from levels around $0.050 to a current weekly range of $0.26 and $0.37, analysts are convinced that there is more growth to come for Hedera (HBAR). Scofield particularly believes that the Hedera token will repeat the bullish trend it started at the beginning of December. Another top analyst known as ALLINCRYPTO on X ( formerly Twitter) speculates that further positive sentiment and bullish momentum will take Hedera price to $1 and beyond. Shawn has also hinted that the crypto market is expecting a super cycle and by then Hedera price would skyrocket. He further told investors not to be surprised if Hedera prices around $3 in a few weeks. Lunex Network Maintains High Demand As It Shows Potential Of Hitting $1 Lunex Network (LNEX) has remained the centre of attraction in the presale market and given its 217% surge presale growth, demand for the token is still over the roof. After nearly smashing a $5 million revenue stream, traders and investors are even more eager to buy into its non-custodial exchange platform which supports wider accessibility and interoperability. To be precise, Lunex Network allows the trading of over 50,000 cryptocurrencies from one blockchain to another without needing to fill in any personal details. Users also have complete control of their assets as they don’t have to use third party apps like Trust Wallet or MetaMask. This privacy-focused approach, coupled with its institutional-friendly features ranks Lunex Network and its native LNEX token among the best cryptos to buy. Notably, the DeFi protocol features a B2B payment gateway, allowing business owners to accept crypto as payment and switch to fiat currency instantly. Additionally, investors can hardly mismanage their assets in this platform as it offers portfolio tracking features. Other features such as its cashback rewards, up to 18% APY and revenue sharing model have also contributed to the 217% rise of its token to a current value of $0.0038. Which Will Reach $1 First Between TRX, HBAR, and LNEX? Hedera and Tron coin are already showing signs of forming new bullish patterns similar to their current position, however market fluctuations are bound to stand in the way. On the other hand, Lunex Network is still in its presale and is only going to have a full blown potential for growth when it lists on DEX platforms. In other words, investors are urged to buy in now to capitalize on its future gains as it poses more potential to reach $1, ahead of the rest.

37520900,https://crypto.news/?p=14318555,1733954758,5 hottest cryptos for millionaire status this Christmas,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. DOGEN, SOL, TRON, DOGE, and TURBO rank among hottest cryptos for millionaire status this Christmas. Table of Contents DOGEN: The ultimate meme token SOL: Fueling scalable dApps TRON: Empowering content creators Dogecoin: Meme coin turned top crypto Turbo: The first AI meme coin Conclusion With the festive season near, the chance for transformative crypto investments arises. As markets evolve rapidly, these five cryptos might set the path to millionaire status this Christmas, turning a modest investment into significant wealth. DOGEN: The ultimate meme token DOGEN is here to take the crown as the alpha of the meme coin world. Built for the boldest holders, DOGEN seeks to dominate with no drama — just an unstoppable march toward new all-time highs. Powered by Solana, DOGEN is primed for a great surge, with a 700% gain projected in the coming months. This beast is set to provide significant returns for those who join its ranks early. For the true believers, DOGEN’s airdrop and referral program are as rewarding as they come. The investors will earn 20% golden points from their recruits’ token buys and stack up profits with a multi-level referral system that keeps on giving — 7% for the direct referrals and even more as their network grows. As altseason approaches, DOGEN holders are set to lead the charge, claiming the perks and profits that come with being part of a winning community. Whether it’s exclusive campaigns, luxury rewards, or a lifestyle that screams success, DOGEN is for those who aim for the top and settle for nothing less. Interested investors can flex hard and potentially earn big through the DOGEN presale. SOL: Fueling scalable dApps Solana is a blockchain platform focused on scalability, offering a foundation for decentralized applications (dApps). It differentiates itself with architectural choices aimed at faster transactions and flexible development options across multiple programming languages. SOL, Solana’s native cryptocurrency, plays a central role in its ecosystem by facilitating transactions, running custom programs, and rewarding network participants. The coin underpins the operation of Solana’s high-capacity network, which avoids sharding or second-layer solutions for scalability. This design aims to attract developers and investors interested in hosting high-activity products and services. In the current market cycle, Solana’s technology and the utility of SOL may appeal to those looking for scalable blockchain solutions. TRON: Empowering content creators TRON is a decentralized blockchain-based operating system launched by the Tron Foundation in 2017. It was created to give content creators full ownership rights, allowing them to receive direct rewards from consumers without intermediaries like YouTube or Facebook. TRON supports smart contracts, various blockchain systems, and dApps. It uses a transaction model similar to Bitcoin, where transactions are recorded on a public ledger. The platform aims to build a decentralized Internet, serving as a tool for developers to create dApps and share content openly without transaction fees. In the current market cycle, TRON’s focus on decentralization and empowering creators highlights its potential in the blockchain industry.

Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin has no maximum supply, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute. In 2021, DOGE reached the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap. This rise was driven by social media buzz and support from figures like Elon Musk. Dogecoin showcases the power of community and social media in financial markets. In the current market cycle, Dogecoin remains a notable player due to its popularity and continued interest from investors. Turbo: The first AI meme coin Turbo is the first meme coin developed entirely by artificial intelligence. Conceived when its founder challenged GPT-4 to create the next big meme coin, TURBO represents a fusion of AI innovation and cryptocurrency culture. As a coin made by AI for the people, it symbolizes a new era where technology drives creative financial instruments. The potential of Turbo lies in its unique origin and the growing interest in AI applications within blockchain technologies. In the current market cycle, TURBO stands out as a novel concept that captures the imagination of both crypto enthusiasts and AI supporters. Conclusion Although SOL, TRX, DOGE, and TURBO show promise, they may offer less short-term potential. DOGEN stands out for those seeking luxury and success. Expected to grow 700% by the end of the presale, with potential for thousand-fold returns, DOGEN follows the path of successful tokens like BONK and Popcat, building a community of market leaders and offering benefits to early adopters.

37520813,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=626219,1733954155,Bitcoin retakes $100k after US inflation data and Trump’s promise to keep his eye on price,"Bitcoin has crossed the $100,000 mark again. Ethereum followed with a 4% rise, though it remains shy of the critical $4,000 resistance level. Crypto-linked stocks got a lift too. Coinbase shares rose 4% , while MicroStrategy surged 8%, showing resilience even as most remain in the red for the week. The rally comes ahead of the Federal Reserve’s December meeting, with high expectations of another interest rate cut. Inflation data clears the way for Bitcoin Bitcoin’s rise comes against the backdrop of the November consumer price index report, which showed a modest 0.3% increase from October and a 2.7% jump year-over-year. This data matched forecasts, calming fears of higher-than-expected inflation. Though Bitcoin didn’t really need the nudge. It remains in a bull run regardless. Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick predicts Bitcoin could hit $200,000 by the end of 2025. “This is not a moonshot. With continued institutional adoption and even modest growth in sovereign wealth fund interest, this target is realistic,” Kendrick said in a note. He pointed out the role of U.S. retirement funds and the possibility of a U.S. strategic reserve fund embracing Bitcoin as a potential game-changer. MicroStrategy’s aggressive buying strategy is also a factor. The company is ahead of schedule on its $42 billion, three-year plan, and Kendrick expects 2025 purchases to outpace those in 2024. Bitcoin’s up 141% year-to-date. Almost half of that surge has come since November 5, when Donald Trump’s election victory brought renewed optimism among crypto lovers. As we reported , he has promised to “keep an eye on Bitcoin’s price” while he’s in office. Analysts double down on Bitcoin’s future Bernstein’s latest note sees Bitcoin replacing gold as the go-to store of value within the next decade. Gautam Chhugani, a Bernstein analyst, wrote, “Bitcoin is well on its way to becoming a standard asset in institutional portfolios and corporate treasuries.” Bernstein expects Bitcoin to reach $200,000 by late 2025. Fundstrat’s Tom Lee is even more bullish, predicting a price of $250,000 in 2025. Bitcoin’s current record high, set earlier this week, stands at $103,844, a figure many believe will be eclipsed sooner rather than later. Despite the short-term volatility expected around the $100,000 level, long-term projections point to substantial growth. Analysts say Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a low-correlation asset, a potential hedge against economic instability, and a legitimate alternative to gold. Yet, challenges remain. Bitcoin is still far from being widely accepted as a medium of exchange or unit of account.

Crypto King Musk (MUSKKING), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKKING is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Crypto King Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crypto King Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Crypto King Musk launched with over $7,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Crypto King Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Crypto King Musk by entering its contract address – v2jWiNpR1m8gHARdM39GosZ8muaxZpowpBgWgWTSCev – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKKING. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/solana-memecoin-crypto-king-musk-muskking-to-surge-13000-ahead-of-exchange-listing-as-bonk-and-doge-fall/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

His donation of a large portion to the India Covid Relief Fund and burning of the remaining tokens brought Shiba Inu into the spotlight. What sets SHIB apart is its vision for the future. Plans are underway for a dedicated NFT platform and a community-led governance system using a DAO model. This suggests that SHIB is striving for a lasting presence in the crypto market, not just fleeting fame. In a market where investors are looking for coins with real-world applications and solid technology, SHIB’s integration with Ethereum could give it an edge.

37520383,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98743,1733953674,"Bitcoin Bursts Back Above $101,000 As Ripple’s XRP, Dogecoin, And Cardano Stage Incredible Comeback","Bitcoin, the world’s oldest and largest cryptocurrency, rose back above the $101,000 level on Wednesday, clawing back most of its losses after a bruising sell-off earlier this week. BTC is currently trading for $101,301 after reaching an intraday high of $101,425, according to CoinGecko data. The asset’s market capitalization is now striving to reach the $2 trillion mark once again. Bitcoin surged came as fresh November CPI data released on Wednesday showed consumer prices rose as expected, keeping the United States Federal Reserve on track for another rate cut next month. In the altcoin market, XRP, the fourth-largest crypto by market cap, is enjoying the most gains: its price has been up by 18.4% over the last 24 hours, and it’s now trading for $2.43. The token rebounded after Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced Tuesday that the firm’s RLUSD stablecoin is launching soon after receiving New York regulatory approval. Elsewhere, Elon Musk’s favorite crypto, Dogecoin (DOGE), has jumped 7.3%, trading for around $0.4114. Meanwhile, Solana’s SOL is up more than 7.8% on the day at a current price of $228.76, while Cardano has spiked 12.4% to $1.08. BTC Price Shrugs Off Microsoft Snub Bitcoin had dipped below $95,000 on Tuesday, triggering a cascade of liquidations of long and short positions. The market correction came after news that software giant Microsoft had voted down a proposal to adopt a corporate BTC treasury. Crypto commentators slammed the decision as myopic. Michael Saylor, Executive Chairman of Bitcoin Development Company, who pitched a Bitcoin adoption strategy to Microsoft’s board of directors earlier this month, wrote in an X post: “In 5 years, they’ll understand. Everyone buys Bitcoin at the price they deserve. #BTC doesn’t wait. It simply transfers wealth to those who see.” Saylor came up with the idea of buying Bitcoin in 2020 to get the best return for shareholders during the COVID-19 pandemic. MicroStrategy now holds a total of 423,650 BTC — or around 2% of Bitcoin’s total supply — after its latest purchase. MicroStrategy’s multibillion-dollar Bitcoin gamble has paid off spectacularly. As of Dec. 11, the software intelligence company’s Bitcoin treasury is worth over $42 billion, accruing unrealized profits of around $16 billion. Suffice it to say that purchasing $42B worth of BTC was a no-brainer for Saylor. He believes the OG crypto will hit $13 million per coin by 2045 and considers $3 million a “bear case.",POSITIVE,BTC | DOGE,ADA | BTC | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-bursts-back-above-101000-as-ripples-xrp-dogecoin-and-cardano-stage-incredible-comeback/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

From Dogecoin’s early days as a joke to multimillion-dollar communities rallying behind new projects, these playful tokens are now serious contenders. But have you heard about BTFD Coin (BTFD) ? Its explosive presale and innovative ecosystem, complete with a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game and staking rewards, have got analysts predicting 100x potential. And while BTFD takes centre stage, Pepe Coin (PEPE) has reached new heights, and Coq Inu (COQ) is gearing up for what could be a game-changing Coinbase listing. Here’s why BTFD Coin is making waves and why Pepe Coin and Coq Inu still hold their own as some of the best meme coins to join now. Let’s dive in! BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Revolution You Can’t Ignore Let’s face it: crypto investors love a good underdog story, and BTFD signifies that spirit. The rallying cry of “ Buy The F***ing Dip ” isn’t just a mindset; it’s a lifestyle for this community-driven project. Its presale performance is nothing short of spectacular, with over $3.4 million raised so far, smashing milestones like $1 million in just 10 days and $2.5 million within 14 days. Currently, in Stage 11 of its presale, BTFD is priced at $0.00012, and over 50 billion coins have already been sold, with 4,400 holders joining the movement. Imagine this: You invest $2,250 at $0.00012 per coin. By the end of the meme crypto presale , when BTFD lists at $0.0006, your investment grows to $11,250. That’s what’s got FOMO kicking in for thousands of investors. And it’s not just about numbers. BTFD’s P2E game, now live in beta, lets users dive into an immersive experience with the Bulls Squad while staking offers APYs of up to 90%. To put it in perspective, BTFD is more than a token. It’s a movement built on Ethereum’s rock-solid blockchain, making it scalable, secure, and accessible for everyone—even those new to crypto. Don’t wait too long; with presale prices climbing toward the eventual $0.0006 listing price, undoubtedly, this is one of the best meme coins to join now. Pepe Coin: Riding High with Record-Breaking Moves Pepe Coin (PEPE) isn’t your average meme token. Born out of internet culture and bolstered by a fiercely loyal community, PEPE has made headlines with its incredible growth. Recently, PEPE reached a staggering $0.0000266 all-time high, pushing its market cap to $11 billion. This surge was fuelled by back-to-back listings on Coinbase and Robinhood, causing nearly a 50% jump in value. But what keeps investors hooked? PEPE’s story of turning $3,000 into $73 million for early adopters is legendary. While newer tokens like BTFD are capturing attention, Pepe remains a symbol of meme coin success. However, with its current trajectory, some analysts question whether it can sustain its growth against fierce competition. What’s clear is that PEPE isn’t going anywhere. As it consolidates its position, it still offers investors a chance to be part of a vibrant and ever-evolving community. It’s no wonder Pepe is counted among the best meme coins to join now. Coq Inu: A Dark Horse Ready to Shine Coq Inu (COQ) might not yet boast Pepe’s astronomical highs, but it’s got something equally tantalising—potential. Trading at $0.00000213 with a market cap of $153.5 million, this Avalanche C-Chain token has been making quiet waves. What’s creating the buzz? Rumours of a Coinbase listing could catapult Coq Inu into mainstream attention. If that happens, the price action could be dramatic. And it’s not just speculation driving COQ’s narrative. Its quirky charm has captured hearts, featuring in Beeple’s digital art and amassing nearly 20 million views on GIPHY. For a token steeped in meme culture, that’s a marketing masterstroke. As COQ continues to build its community and expand its reach, it’s a contender worth watching. For investors looking to diversify, Coq Inu represents an intriguing option. While it doesn’t yet match BTFD’s ecosystem depth or Pepe’s market capitalisation, it’s carving out its niche in the meme coin universe. It’s certainly among the best meme coins to join now. Conclusion: Seize the Moment with BTFD Coin It’s clear from our research and market trends that BTFD Coin stands head and shoulders above the rest when it comes to innovation and presale performance. With a thriving community, an engaging P2E game, and incredible staking rewards, BTFD isn’t just a token; it’s a lifestyle. Add to that its presale milestones and potential 5x gains before even hitting exchanges, and you’ve got an unbeatable investment opportunity. Pepe Coin and Coq Inu, though, aren’t to be overlooked. PEPE’s record-breaking run and COQ’s promising potential make them solid choices for any portfolio. But if you’re looking for the best meme coins to join now , BTFD Coin is your golden ticket. So, what are you waiting for? Join the BTFD Coin presale now and secure your place in what could be the next big crypto success story.

37520295,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=626222,1733952920,"Balancer V3 debuts with Aave, unveils boosted pools and advanced developer tools","Balancer (BAL), a decentralized exchange protocol, has unveiled its V3 upgrade, which will optimize liquidity, intensify trading volume, and offer advanced tools for developers. Partnering with Aave, Balancer V3 launches 100% boosted pools leveraging its permissionless automated market maker technology with Aave’s yield market infrastructure. The partnership aims to streamline earnings from swaps and lending markets. Although Aave is the first launch partner, more players are expected to follow the queue. Balancer co-founder Fernando Martinelli said: “Aave’s integration with Balancer v3 is a milestone for both ecosystems. Together, we’re delivering a liquidity solution that’s efficient, scalable, and accessible for everyone in DeFi.” ~ Fernando Martinelli According to the Balancer team, the boosted pools provide a yielding liquidity solution that channels all principal capital to the external yield market while ensuring liquidity for swaps. They clarified that liquidity providers need only a single click to optimize profits and readily access DeFi’s most structured markets without relying on active management. Aave Labs founder Stani Kulechov said that by combining Aave’s and Balancer’s strengths, the new Aave V3 Boosted Pools will empower users with enhanced capital efficiency and simplified yield generation. He was clear that users would maximize returns while seamlessly accessing supply and swap functions, giving them a smooth user experience with minimized gas costs. Balancer V3 empowers developers to build custom pools Balancer assists automated portfolio management and supports cryptocurrency trading across Ethereum and other EVM-compatible blockchains. Its modular design is critical for DeFi projects like CoW Swap and Xave to build custom pools modified to their standards. The V3 upgrade will further develop this modular design by removing unnecessary hurdles to allow developers to innovate faster. Some new features with the launch include custom pool types that allow for faster building of AMMs. Moreover, it has a Hooks Framework to extend the functionality of existing pools. The Hooks Framework allows for dynamic liquidity management, making real-time fee adjustments while optimizing yield. The technology can automatically rebalance in specific market conditions, thus allowing tailored parameters for unique trading strategies. Another interesting feature is the StableSurge Hook launching with the Balancer V3. This feature is deployed to shield stable assets during market volatility, rewarding liquidity owners with high profits. DeFi protocols express strong interest in Balancer V3 According to Balancer, DeFi protocols are already showing interest in V3. They mentioned Gyroscope, which already offers asymmetric liquidity pools without the need for active management. They also said they have interest from QuantAMM, which leverages Balancer’s custom pool abilities to develop on-chain fund products. The new boosted V3 pool will be a game changer in the crypto ecosystem. Its ability to shield stable assets during volatility excites users. Besides, it appears easy to leverage and more efficient. Aave protocol took the lead in partnership, while other protocols will join in. It will be interesting to see the long-term impact the innovation will have on the crypto sphere.

37520304,https://blockworks.co/news/researcher-encourages-solana-public-mempool,1733952600,"Solana should reintroduce a public mempool, researcher says","This is a segment from the Lightspeed newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . It seems like conversations about sandwich attacks on Solana — where advanced traders front-run and back-run trades to extract value at the expense of unsophisticated traders — come and go every few weeks with little resolution. Most people agree sandwiching is bad, but there’s not yet consensus on how the problem can be solved. The discourse flared up again this week after the Solana researcher Ben Coverston posted on social media that the network’s top sandwich bot, dubbed arsc, was pocketing millions of dollars-worth of tokens per day from sandwich attacks. Coverston predicted that if current trends hold, arsc would become Solana’s largest staker within 1-2 years. Interestingly, one of the researcher’s proposed fixes included the reintroduction of a “mempool” staging area for transactions — which Jito got rid of earlier this year in hopes of preventing sandwiching. Sandwich attackers exploit slippage — the gap between a trade’s expected and executed price. They front-run the target transaction by placing their own trade first, which shifts the price in their favor. Then, they back-run the same transaction by placing another trade immediately after, locking in a financial win off of the manipulated price movement. As a result, the original trader often ends up with a worse execution price, effectively subsidizing the attacker’s profit. This is a form of maximal extractible value (MEV) where sandwichers extract value from Solana blocks at the expense of less sophisticated users. Solana has taken a number of actions meant to prevent sandwiching in recent months. In March, Solana infrastructure company Jito Labs got rid of its public mempool , which was a staging area where transactions could be arranged to create MEV revenue for validators. Sandwiching validators then set up their own private mempools, and the attacks continued. Two months later, the Solana Foundation stopped offering financial help to validators who were participating in private mempools. In September, Jito blacklisted a group of private mempool validators from participating in its stake pool, which is a large pile of staked SOL Jito’s software delegates. The criticism of the Solana Foundation and Jito’s blacklist-the-bad-guys strategy is that it’s essentially playing whack-a-mole: Blacklisted validators can always spin up a new validator and resume sandwiching. That’s what’s interesting about Coverston’s proposal, which he expanded upon in a blog post . The privatization of mempools has reduced the number of validators executing sandwich attacks, but the few who remain, like arsc, are staking their substantial profits back into their own operations. This has led to a concerning centralization of staked Solana within a handful of nefarious validators. To counter this, Coverston suggests re-enabling a public mempool. While this move might make sandwiching more widespread, it could also foster competition among validators executing these strategies. The increased competition would help distribute MEV profits more evenly, preventing a single group of validators from disproportionately accumulating stake — and power — on the network. This would essentially be a reversal from Solana’s anti-sandwiching strategy over the past nine months. To put this all in perspective though, sandwiching may not really matter in the long run. High-frequency trading strategies that are ascendent in the US equities market are basically meant to sandwich attack other traders, Blockworks Research’s Ryan Connor pointed out .

Ethereum and Stellar Make Headlines, But $5.5M Raised Says It All","What’s got crypto enthusiasts buzzing this month? While Bitcoin’s steady climb and Monero’s push for privacy make waves, a fresh contender, Qubetics, is stealing the spotlight. In a market buzzing with innovation and competition, Qubetics is addressing real-world issues with groundbreaking solutions, and analysts are predicting massive returns for early investors. So, what makes Qubetics stand out, and why are investors flocking to this emerging star? Let’s dive in and explore how it compares to Bitcoin and Monero, two of the biggest names in crypto. Qubetics: Revolutionising Privacy and Security with dVPN Ever wondered why privacy and security are still a concern in 2024 despite technological advances? Centralised VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) are part of the problem, not the solution. They often come with security vulnerabilities, store user data, and even expose users to privacy breaches. Qubetics tackles these issues head-on with its decentralised VPN (dVPN). Unlike traditional VPNs, Qubetics’ dVPN ensures total user privacy by eliminating central points of failure and safeguarding data with robust encryption. With growing concerns over government surveillance and cyber threats, the demand for such a solution is skyrocketing. At its 12th presale stage, Qubetics has raised over $5.5 million and sold 305 million $TICS tokens, priced at just $0.0311. With over 8,400 token holders already on board, it’s clear this project is making waves. Analysts predict that once the mainnet launches, $TICS could skyrocket to $10–15. Imagine investing $1,000 now—that could potentially turn into $320,000 in a bullish market! Qubetics’ decentralised approach eliminates these issues, offering users a secure and private browsing experience without compromising speed or functionality. With the rise in remote work and global internet usage, the need for dVPNs has never been more critical. What’s even more exciting? Qubetics isn’t just about solving problems—it’s about reshaping how we think about privacy and security. For better guidance, please watch this video . Bitcoin: The Steady Giant with Room to Grow Bitcoin has been around for over a decade, and its resilience remains unmatched. As the original cryptocurrency, it continues to attract investors seeking stability and long-term growth. Bitcoin’s market dominance and institutional adoption make it a safe bet for many. Recent forecasts suggest Bitcoin could approach $100,000 in the next year, thanks to increasing demand and limited supply. But while it’s a great choice for preserving value, Bitcoin lacks the innovative edge of newer projects like Qubetics. Monero: Privacy King or a Thing of the Past? Monero has long been the go-to crypto for privacy enthusiasts. With its focus on anonymous transactions, it offers a level of secrecy unmatched by most other coins. However, regulatory scrutiny has cast a shadow over Monero’s future. Governments are cracking down on privacy-focused cryptocurrencies, which could limit its growth. Still, Monero remains a solid choice for those prioritising anonymity. But compared to Qubetics’ dVPN, Monero’s use case seems narrower. For investors, $1,000 in Monero could yield returns, but the uncertainty surrounding its regulatory future makes it a riskier play. Conclusion In a crowded market, Qubetics stands out as a game-changer. While Bitcoin and Monero have their strengths, neither offers the combination of innovation, affordability, and growth potential that Qubetics does. So, are you ready to join the 8,400+ token holders who’ve already invested in this groundbreaking project? With just a few weeks left in the presale, now’s the time to act. Don’t miss your chance to be part of the future of decentralised privacy. Visit the Qubetics presale now and secure your $TICS tokens before it’s too late!

37519387,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=626206,1733951702,Who falls first in the trillion dollar gamble? Bitcoin or MicroStrategy?,"The war between Bitcoin and MicroStrategy is heating up. The company’s entire strategy, and perhaps its existence, is tied to Bitcoin’s unpredictable market. With a trillion dollars on the line, the stakes couldn’t be higher. MicroStrategy has dumped $25.6 billion into Bitcoin since 2020, scooping up 423,650 BTC at an average price of $60,324 per coin. The company, once known for its software, now holds 2% of all Bitcoin in circulation. With Bitcoin trading at over $100,000 this week, those holdings are worth $42 billion. Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy’s co-founder and executive chairman, has become Bitcoin’s loudest megaphone. His “21/21 Plan” outlines a strategy to raise $42 billion—half through debt and half through equity—to buy more Bitcoin. According to Saylor, Bitcoin is the future of corporate finance. He’s even predicting it could hit $13 million per coin by 2045. The confidence is through the roof, but so is the company’s exposure. Bitcoin breaks records, and MicroStrategy’s stock explodes Bitcoin crossed the $100,000 mark, shattering expectations and setting a new all-time high. This is a massive milestone for the crypto market, and it’s directly fueling MicroStrategy’s meteoric rise. The company’s stock price has skyrocketed by 540% this year, catapulting its market valuation from $1.1 billion in 2020 to $83 billion. But this is where the cracks start to show. MicroStrategy’s success hinges entirely on Bitcoin’s price. If Bitcoin stumbles, MicroStrategy stumbles harder. Analysts warn that if Bitcoin dips below $30,000, the company could be forced to sell parts of its Bitcoin holdings to cover debts. This could trigger a domino effect, sending Bitcoin’s price even lower and deepening MicroStrategy’s troubles. The company is also dealing with $8 billion in convertible notes due over the next few years. These notes are essentially IOUs, and paying them off depends on Bitcoin maintaining its high value. If the market cools, the company could face a financial nightmare. Saylor pushes Bitcoin on Microsoft, shareholders say no Saylor is trying to bring other corporations into the fold. At Microsoft’s shareholder meeting in October 2024, he pitched the idea of diversifying the tech giant’s balance sheet with Bitcoin. He even shared a chart showing Bitcoin’s 62% annual returns from 2020 to 2024, far outpacing Microsoft’s 18% and the S&P 500’s 14%. “Microsoft can’t afford to miss the next technology wave, and Bitcoin is that wave,” Saylor said. His message was clear: convert cash, dividends, and debt into Bitcoin, and shareholders will reap the rewards. But Microsoft wasn’t buying it. Proxy advisors Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services recommended rejecting the proposal, and shareholders followed suit. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella wasn’t swayed either. Despite this, Saylor didn’t back down. He even tweeted Nadella, saying, “If you want to make the next trillion dollars for Microsoft shareholders, call me.” The company, which already accepts crypto payments, said it continues to monitor trends in the space. But for now, the company isn’t making any big moves. While Microsoft’s stock is up 19% this year, it’s nothing compared to MicroStrategy’s explosive growth. If Bitcoin can deliver a consistent 43.2% quarterly yield, MicroStrategy’s math turns insane. By the end of 2026, the company could multiply its Bitcoin holdings per share by 17x. Let that sink in for a moment. A 2-3x net asset value (NAV) sounds laughably small compared to what Saylor’s playbook is targeting.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/who-falls-first-bitcoin-or-microstrategy/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37519387.jpeg

Synthetix acquired TLX, the leverage token platform, through a token-for-token transaction. Synthetix announced that the acquisition gained approval on SIP-412 and TIP-14. This acquisition comes shortly after a similar procurement of Kwenta. Leveraged Tokens and Their Role in DeFi Synthetix clarified these moves are steps in the protocol’s strategy of evolving as a principal product issuer after designing a decentralized liquidity layer. For clarification, leveraged tokens refer to the tokenized form of a levered strategy that multiplies the results of the price movement of an underlying asset like Ethereum or Bitcoin. Leveraged tokens allow users to access leverage without trading on a perpetual futures platform. It also eliminates the need to manage margin requirements. Additionally, traders can easily mint their leveraged token, transfer it, and redeem it at their convenience. According to the paraent platform, TLX’s acquisition is the maiden end-customer, revenue-generating product developed on Synthetix. The protocol owns it and will be responsible for its operation. Synthetix to Unveil Incentive Program in 2025 Users should anticipate the “juicy leveraged token incentive” program in 2025. As per its update, this will happen as soon as a thorough audit of TLX products has been conducted. Synthetix says it plans to improve parameters and redeploy all smart contracts. Once done, it will relaunch TLX products on the same Base network. TLX, which is also the native token, will be incinerated and changed to Synthetix’s token to complete the acquisition and switch. To guarantee a quicker route to launching, Synthetix says it will utilize TLX’s existing codebase as a basis for its designs. That is, it will be used to design the DeFi protocol’s leveraged tokens in a bid to hit the market faster. Synthetix’s Growing Impact on DeFi Kain Warwick founded Synthetix in 2017. The platform allows users to trade synthetic assets, such as stocks, currencies, and commodities, on the Ethereum blockchain amid scaling potentials .

According to the analysis, wallets with 100 to 1,000 BTC, dubbed “Dolphins,” are the only group currently actively accumulating Bitcoin, while all other categories of addresses are in a distribution phase, suggesting that they are selling their holdings. Alphractal highlighted a notable correlation between these Dolphin addresses and Bitcoin’s price trends. Since late 2020, this group of addresses has shown a strong correlation with price action, with accumulation typically preceding price increases and distribution often signaling declines. “Since most addresses above 1,000 BTC belong to exchanges, this category seems to represent institutional action better than others,” Alphractal said. Dolphins reached their peak of accumulation on Dec. 6, holding around 344,000 BTC after a 60-day buying spree. However, last week, the group sold 11,000 BTC, contributing to the recent market volatility. Despite this, the analysis notes that it is “too early to conclude that accumulation has stopped” and recommends monitoring on-chain metrics closely for more insight. Related News: After Today's CPI Report, Former FED Member Mester Shares Prediction on Rate Cuts The report also highlighted the SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) Trend Signal, a key metric for assessing Bitcoin’s price trends. This metric measures profit-taking behavior in the market and has historically been a reliable predictor of trend changes. Currently, the SOPR Trend Signal is approaching a critical threshold. According to the analytics firm, if the blue line crosses below the orange line, a sell signal will be triggered, indicating that enough dispersion has occurred to trigger a downward price trend. However, Alphractal noted that these signals are often delayed, with trend changes typically occurring days after the metrics cross. *This is not investment advice.

Pepe MAGA (PEPEMAGA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe MAGA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe MAGA by entering its contract address – C3zan7DDUAxZDSLnSxpptmyARsvGAbah4KWQB5QokoFM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

37520912,https://cryptonews.com/?p=318720,1733950904,Solana’s Raydium Tops Uniswap in Monthly Decentralized Exchange Trading Volumes Again,"As bullish US CPI data fuels Bitcoin price back above $100,000, the biggest Solana DEX Raydium is again in the spotlight after crushing Uniswap’s monthly trading volumes… again. Solana is the big story of 2024, having unlocked unhinged success amid the meme coin hysteria that has characterized the crypto market this year. Among Solana DEXs, Raydium is taking the lead despite strong competition from Pump.Fun and Jupiter. It has solidified its position as the top Solana DEX, with a total value locked (TVL) of $2.29 billion. Indeed, DEX volumes have been one of the biggest drivers of growth in the crypto market in 2024, with current volumes exceeding $18.216 billion traded in the past 24-hours across all blockchains, with DEX dominance sitting at 47.94%. This is approaching the sensational levels last seen in June, when total DEX volume dominated the space at over $31 billion – however, that came at a time with higher DEX dominance, suggesting newer users on CEXs are currently dominating overall market volume. Raydium Trading Volumes Beat Uniswap DEX Again Since October 2024 , Raydium DEX on SOL has been the leader in trading volume among DEXs on all blockchains. In November, Raydium processed $124.6B, exceeding the trading volume of the previous leader, Uniswap, by 30% – an impressive achievement that shows the disproportionate share of meme coin trading hosted by Solana after the success of Pump.Fun. In fact, Raydium is so successful on Solana that it now boasts 41% of all Solana transactional volume over the past 7-days, Raydium also stands at double the volume of the nearest rival Lifinity and 18x Lifinity’s TVL – so safe to say it’s not going anywhere soon. RAY Price Analysis: How Is Raydium Price Reacting to the Uniswap-Beating Volume? As the crypto market digests Raydium’s bullish November DEX volume data, RAY is reacting with a bullish effect after shifting up following the news to reclaim key moving average support. With Raydium price pushing high, RAY is currently standing at a market price of $5.64 (representing a 24-hour change of +15.8%). This comes as the Messari data drop triggered a major candle, sending the price surging back above 20DMA support at $5.28, reversing the bearish trend that had gripped the RAY price over the last 14 days. Reclaiming this moving average marks a successful consolidation of dramatic +288% gains for RAY price since September and comes as HTF price action continues to build on mid-October’s golden cross. Now pushing to the upside, RAY holders are targeting an overhead layer of historical resistance at $6.5, with $7 forming a likely topside target given the multi-month trading channel. Yet, with the RSI already beginning to overheat at 57.69, it seems a consolidation above $6.5 is needed before RAY can hammer the upper trendline.

In a new YouTube interview with Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy, Bitcoin bull Saylor says that Bitcoin is like a game where all participants are winners. “Prometheus gave us fire to warm up, Satoshi gave us a game we can all win. And Bitcoin is that game. You don’t want to be on a network where they can censor what you say and they can freeze your account. Bitcoin is a monetary network where it won’t censor where you send your money, it won’t freeze your account, and it’s engineered in such a way that on the margin, you’re winning the game over time.” Building on the analogy, Saylor says Bitcoin is like being on a basketball team with the greatest players on it. “Wouldn’t it be great if you had a basketball team and you had LeBron James and you had Michael Jordan, and you had the digital version of them, and they played forever, and you could get on the court and play with them, and they’re scoring 100 points and you’re scoring two points, but you’re all getting rich together and you’re all winning together. That’s what Bitcoin is like. It’s like everybody gets to play. Everywhere in the world I go, there’s like a fan club. There’s hundreds of millions of people that are on Team Bitcoin. You should join Team Bitcoin. The 100 million fans would be rooting for you. And the great thing about it is, you don’t just win the game, you get wealthy while you’re winning the game.” Bitcoin is trading for $97,051 at time of writing, flat on the day.

This strategic rebound underscores the token’s resilience and growing bullish momentum, setting the stage for a potential climb toward new heights. With market sentiment shifting and technical indicators flashing promising signals, the question arises: Can POPCAT sustain this upward push and reach fresh milestones? Let’s dive into the technical indicators and market dynamics driving this pivotal moment. Technical Indicators Signal Strength: A Closer Look At POPCAT Chart The 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows a resurgence of upside strength as the RSI signal line has successfully climbed out of the oversold zone. This recovery suggests a shift in market sentiment, with buyers gradually regaining control. Currently advancing toward the 50% mark, this movement reflects increasing optimism in the market. Should the RSI breach this midpoint, it could signal the strength of the upward momentum, setting the stage for POPCAT to rally toward key resistance levels and solidify its recovery trajectory. Related Reading: POPCAT Nears Breakout Towards New ATH, But Analysts Warn Of Possible Correction Also, a closer examination of the 1-day RSI shows a noticeable reversal, as the RSI signal line is now rising toward the 50% threshold after recently dropping to 40%. Significantly, this shift also implies that selling pressure may be subsiding, with buyers starting to regain control. As the RSI indicator moves into neutral territory, the market could be poised for a trend change. If the RSI continues to climb, this could signal a strengthening bullish trend, offering POPCAT an opportunity to build momentum and challenge higher price levels. Critical Resistance Levels In Focus For New Heights As the meme coin rebounds from key support levels, the focus now shifts to the critical resistance levels that could determine its next move. POPCAT at the $1 mark has proven to be a strong foundation, but the token must overcome key resistance zones for it to reach new heights Related Reading: Solana Memecoin Market Thrives: POPCAT Reaches New Record Price Of $1.75 With technical indicators demonstrating increasing bullish momentum, POPCAT’s price is now approaching the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). A move above this key indicator could spark a rally toward the $1.5 resistance level. If POPCAT successfully breaks through this resistance, it could set the stage for an extended price surge, potentially propelling the token to even higher targets. Traders will be watching closely to see if these critical levels can be surpassed, paving the way for continued upside. However, should POPCAT fail to break above the 100-day SMA, it may experience a decline, possibly heading back toward the $1 mark. A drop below this key support level could trigger a bearish continuation, with the price likely to drop to the $0.8 support level and other ranges.

To read full editions, subscribe . The Chinese yuan fell against the US dollar Wednesday morning after Reuters reported Chinese officials may opt to move away from their “stable currency” policy in response to tariffs under President-elect Donald Trump. The key words here are “stable currency policy.” That’s not to be confused with “stablecoin policy,” which China also has (but that’s a topic for another newsletter). China’s central bank is notorious for its commitments to keep the yuan stable , but a strategic currency devaluation does have some historical precedent. It’s a tool China used back in 2018 and 2019 during Trump’s first term. Allowing the yuan to lose value against the dollar makes exports less expensive, potentially offsetting the 10% tariff Trump has said he’d impose during his second stint in Washington; but devaluation also poses risks to the local economy. Hypothetically, foreign buyers may be paying less for Chinese goods, but Chinese consumers would be paying more. The Chinese yuan slid around 0.2% Wednesday, dropping to 7.26 per dollar. Year to date, the yuan has lost 2.4% against the dollar. The move comes as President Joe Biden plans to increase Section 301 tariffs designed to target China’s cleantech industry during his final weeks in office. “Many countries, when they’re faced with unilateral actions of that sort, look for ways to retaliate,” US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told Bloomberg today when asked about Trump’s broad tariff plans for China. “My guess would be that [China] would do that.” We’re 40 days out from the inauguration, so this story is just getting started.

The wallet will now directly display Pump.fun and Moonshot meme tokens. Phantom wallet will now allow the viewing and buying of meme tokens just minutes after their launch, the firm posted Wednesday. This means the most widely used Solana wallet will provide users direct access to Pump.fun and Moonshot tokens, with the potential for swapping. Swapping in Phantom just got more fun 💃 📲 Discover tokens from @pumpdotfun and @moonshotdotcc 💎 Buy memecoins within minutes of launching ⚠️ Assess potential risks with security metrics at your fingertips pic.twitter.com/Oa74ZwqEc0 — Phantom (@phantom) December 11, 2024 Phantom will display new tokens, as well as their bonding curve progress, potentially opening up the meme space to its 7M monthly active users. Pump.fun itself has upward of 1.5M daily active users, but they do not overlap with all Phantom wallet owners. Potential traders will be able to use Phantom to find the best way of trading new meme assets. Solana on-chain swaps are still risky due to the potential for failed transactions, so aggregators and routers are key to successful swaps. Phantom has added its own automated slippage, to perform swaps from within the wallet. Meme tokens are also extremely volatile and not all trades may be successful or lead to positive earnings. The direct inclusion of new memes may lead to more discovery and exposure. The time span of minutes may be too long for some tokens, which are sniped even earlier but may expose the market to a wider pool of potential buyers. On Pump.fun, only about 3% of wallets have earned over $1,000, as most tokens end up as rug pulls. For that reason, Phantom has issued a high-risk warning when engaging with newly launched tokens. The addition of meme launchpad access follows other recent trends for Phantom, including support for the SUI L1 chain. Phantom also intends to offer cross-chain capabilities. The wallet still supports Bitcoin and the Ethereum ecosystem. Pump.fun aims for volume recovery The addition of meme tokens on the Phantom wallet arrives after Pump.fun activity slowed down from its peak. Both new launches and active users are off their all-time highs since the peak in late November. Pump.fun decreased the launch frenzy after the site removed its live-streaming feature due to overwhelmed moderation and dubious content. Pump.fun trading volumes are trending downward. | Source: Dune Analytics The platform is still the major source of new meme tokens. Moonshot has carved out a small niche for its own launches. However, daily new launches are just 2.5% of the total, with the rest still concentrated on Pump.fun. An additional hit came from Pump.fun deciding to limit its users from the UK. The share of UK users is now down to 3.67%, as the platform warns it will stop serving UK users. For now, the decision originates with Pump.fun, and the ban does not come from UK regulators. Pump.fun still receives most of its traffic from the USA, India, and Canada, which are all traditionally crypto-friendly regions. Pump.fun ecosystem tokens keep growing their influence Despite the slowdown of Pump.fun, its meme tokens have been successful. Only a handful of tokens graduate to prominence, but Pump.fun has produced three assets added to the Coinbase meme portfolio. The most successful Pump.fun memes have moved on to larger exchanges while keeping a high profile on social media. The ecosystem of Pump.fun tokens is now valued at over $7.23B, led by Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) with a market capitalization of $1.3B. Pump.fun also started the trend of cult tokens and extended irrational holding, helping boost the entire meme space. Other high-profile trends included AI agent tokens such as GOAT, Fartcoin, and Act I the AI Prophecy. Recently, Pump.fun also boosted the Just a Chill Guy token, the most prominent among assets inspired by TikTok trends.

In a post on the social media platform X, Ripple chief executive Brad Garlinghouse says that Ripple USD (RLUSD) – the firm’s new dollar-pegged crypto asset – has been approved by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). “This just in… we have final approval from NYDFS for RLUSD! Exchange and partner listings will be live soon – and reminder: when RLUSD is live, you’ll hear it from Ripple first.” Ripple originally planned to launch RLUSD on December 4th. However, as of now, there is no official release date for the stablecoin, though Ripple says it’s rolling it out “soon.” “RLUSD is launching soon! Stay vigilant and report any impersonations or scams.” News of the approval had little impact on XRP , the digital asset associated with Ripple, as it is for $2.43 at time of writing, a 5% decrease during the last 24 hours. In November, the payments platform announced exchange partnerships for RLUSD, including popular crypto firms Bitstamp and MoonPay. In August, Ripple kicked off beta testing for the stablecoin on the XRP Ledger and the Ethereum (ETH) mainnet. Ripple first announced its intentions to launch RLUSD in April. However, about a month later, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) – which sued Ripple in 2020 for allegedly selling unregistered securities – said that RLUSD also qualifies as an unregistered security. Ripple Labs won its lawsuit against the SEC in 2023 when the judge in the case ruled that the company’s automated, open-market sales of XRP did not constitute security offerings.

37520911,https://cryptonews.com/?p=318765,1733950352,Solana Poised for $295 Surge After Correction – Are the Bulls Ready to Take Control?,"With a substantial 4.81% uptick today, the Solana price appears to have moved past its recent consolidation, reaffirming bullish end-of-year projections for the altcoin. While even leading altcoins did not escape the liquidation event unscathed, Solana has proven to be among the most resilient, down just 2.38% for the week. Indeed, as trading volume dips 26% to $7.5 billion, the bears seem to have taken the back seat as the recent volatility appears to have subsided. Solana Price Analysis: Is $295 Next? A bullish breakout could be in play as the Solana price nears the end of a symmetrical triangle pattern forming since early November. Despite a breakdown of the pattern during the early week $1.6 billion market-wide liquidation event, Solana has returned to attempt a bullish breakout. This time, though, the bulls appear to be taking the lead as the MACD line affirms a decisive crossover above the signal line. Historically, this move has coincided with significant upticks in the Solana price. Particularly with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) in a more favorable position, at a neutral but bullish-leaning 56, the foundation for a breakout attempt seems strong. If the pattern materializes, a breakout would set a price target at a new all-time high of $295 towards the year’s end, representing an almost 30% advance on current prices. Could Solana Go Higher? Looking wider, a potential breakout from this point could continue the breakout path of a cup-and-handle pattern forming since late 2021. SOL / USDT 3D chart, cup-and-handle pattern breakout. Source: Binance. The breakout from the pattern’s handle in late November has been somewhat stalled by recent volatility, but a potential turnaround could set the sights back to its target of $380, a massive 60% jump from current prices. This target is much more credible running into 2025, particularly as fundamentals like potential Solana ETF approval stand to bolster the altcoin’s trajectory.

The meme token had enjoyed a very strong 30 days, setting a new ATH of $0.00002803 only two days ago. So even with today’s loss it remains up by 13% in a week and by 92% in a month, with its momentum leading to some very positive PEPE price predictions for the coming months. Such gains have resulted in some very big profits for certain farsighted traders, with chain data showing that one whale has turned a $3,000 investment into a $73 million profit over the course of a year and a half, highlighting PEPE’s ongoing potential as a vehicle for substantial returns. PEPE Investor Turns $3,000 Into $73 Million – Is This the Greatest Crypto Flip Ever?

This means that, in total, they’ve made a whopping 24,656x return, in about a year and a half. Not only does this trader still have 1 trillion PEPE, but other whales are continuing to accumulate the coin, suggesting that more gains are coming. Indeed, Lookonchain has also tweeted that nine wallets (possibly belonging to the same whale) accumulated 555 billion PEPE in only a few hours yesterday.

Its chart today suggests that it’s already regaining momentum after correcting in the wake of its new ATH. Its relative strength index (purple) has bounced back from around 35 to 50 in the past hour, signalling a return of buying pressure. Source: TradingView Additionally, we see PEPE’s 30-period average (orange) flatten out after a big dip, suggesting that the coin is re-entering a growth spurt. This also receives support from the fact that the coin’s price has risen above the same average, again pointing to a bullish reversal. Based on this, PEPE could reach $0.00002600 by the end of the week, and $0.000030 by the end of the month.

He noted that the price of Bitcoin had gained over 50% since the U.S. elections, and Trump’s enthusiasm for crypto signaled strong federal support.

His call came as other states considered strategic crypto reserves to promote individual states’ BTC holdings outside the federal government. Pennsylvania and Florida are currently debating models for holding Bitcoin reserves. He believes the increase in states’ accumulation of Bitcoin would ultimately attract state businesses and investments. Sorrell also believed in diversifying a well-balanced portfolio that included different types of asset groups. He noted that most states had zero exposure to crypto, a $3 trillion asset class. According to Sorrell, crypto was the most rapidly growing asset class, averaging 55% annually for the last 15 years, and it has the greatest potential for price increase. “The debate over whether crypto will succeed has ended. Now, the fight for which states will benefit from it has begun. The states that are first to adopt a tax and regulatory framework that are friendly to crypto will attract business and investment.” – Andrew Sorrell According to the state auditor, bonds and treasuries investments had their place, but earning a yield of 4% with 2.7% inflation, barely broke even. He added that Alabama would benefit by diversifying investments away from dollar-based assets. Sorrell noted that Bitcoin’s value was not affected by what happened to the U.S. dollar. He argued that BTC holders could even benefit from the demise of the dollar. It would strengthen individual states’ balance sheets and could be used as collateral for debt issuances in the future. The authorization of BTC and ETH ETFs simplifies crypto acquisition Sorrell claimed that the details about states holding Bitcoin reserves were still being worked on since it was a relatively new idea. He, however, mentioned that states could now buy into crypto as easily as purchasing stocks because the U.S. SEC had authorized BTC and ETH ETFs. Sorrell suggested that Alabama’s BTC reserve could be modeled after the federal ASBR (American Strategic Bitcoin Reserve) promised by Trump. The state auditor general continued to say that Alabama should use a dollar-cost-averaging approach over two years. He advised that buying during a bull market was not the best timing, but monthly purchases over a period of two years were a better strategy that averaged out the state’s entry price. Notably, Sorrell advocated for a gradual approach to crypto investment, although he was all-in on the Bitcoin reserve idea (whether state or federal). He explained that ownership of rapidly growing asset classes came with the increased risk of volatility. For this reason, Sorrell asked crypto investors to ignore short-term market trends and focus on long-term returns instead.

To read full editions, subscribe . It’s been 11 months since US spot bitcoin ETFs went live on Jan. 11. To mark the occasion, here are 11 facts about those products: Combined net inflows now stand at $34.3 billion, according to Farside Investors data . BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) alone has welcomed $35 billion to its coffers, while Fidelity’s product is the runner-up with flows of $12.1 billion. Since Nov. 6 (the day Donald Trump was named the election winner, removing crypto’s remaining reputational risk for many), the bitcoin ETF category has reeled in $10.8 billion of new capital. The segment has collectively notched net inflows on 158 of 231 trading days (68% of the time). The best day (nearly $1.4 billion) came on Nov. 7. The most outflows ($564 million, on May 1) were attributed in part to a profit-taking-fueled BTC dip . BlackRock’s IBIT had $50.8 billion in assets, as of Dec. 10. That’s about $17 billion more than the firm’s Gold Trust (IAU), which launched in 2005; but it’s about $24 billion less than the assets in State Street’s SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), which hit the market in 2004. While IBIT’s average daily inflows are $152 million, that figure for the WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW) stands at less than $1 million. On the point of varying flow success, nearly $21 billion has left the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) — a result largely anticipated . The firm’s cheaper Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC), launched on July 31, has captured almost $900 million of new money. As for volumes, an average of 44.5 million IBIT shares trade per day (worth roughly $2.6 billion at IBIT’s current price). The BlackRock product ranks eighth in that category (by shares) across all ETFs in the trailing three months — slightly behind the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY). Since spot ether ETFs hit US markets on July 23, capital entering the BTC products ($16.8 billion) is roughly nine times more than the net flows ($1.9 billion) going into their ETH counterparts. So ETH ETF net inflows over that span is roughly 11% that of bitcoin ETFs — below Bloomberg Intelligence estimates that fell between 15% and 25%. Institutional buyers of these ETFs have included hedge funds, advisers and even pension funds . Jersey City officials told Blockworks the city’s pension fund planned to buy bitcoin ETFs this month. Data shared by Bloomberg Intelligence suggests bitcoin ETFs now hold more bitcoin than the estimated 1.1 million BTC held by Satoshi Nakamoto. Put another way, this is about 5% of the overall bitcoin supply. Lastly, the value of each fund’s BTC stash — compared to how much they paid for the coins — may not be what you think. Blockworks’ David Canellis wrote about this recently. Bitwise executives predicted Tuesday that bitcoin ETFs will attract more flows next year than they did in 2024.

Its strong fundamentals, rapid growth, and innovative features are drawing attention from both retail and institutional investors. As CYBRO prepares for its market debut, its presale success and accelerated progress signal that this is just the beginning. Interested investors wouldnt want to miss the opportunity to be part of a project poised to make a significant impact on the DeFi landscape. Solana eyes $296 resistance as RSI signals potential rebound Solana (SOL) is trading between $219.27 and $251.07, showing steadiness in its current price range. The nearest resistance level is at $264.92, and a push above this could see prices testing the next resistance at $296.73. The nearest support is at $201.32, providing a cushion against downward movements. Over the past month, Solana’s price has increased by 8.63%, indicating potential for growth. The 10-day simple moving average is slightly below the current price range, while the 100-day average stands at $233.54. The Relative Strength Index is at 38.02, suggesting the coin is approaching oversold territory. This could imply a possible upward movement if buying pressure increases. Ex-MATIC nears oversold levels, eyes $1.08 amid 51% monthly surge Ex-MATIC (POL) is currently trading between $0.59 and $0.79. In the past month, its price jumped by about 51%, though it fell around 11% this week. The Relative Strength Index is at 37.66, suggesting it’s nearing oversold levels. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is below the 100-day average, hinting at a possible upward turn. If the price climbs past the resistance at $0.88, it could reach the next level at $1.08, which would be a significant gain from the current price. On the flip side, if it drops below the support at $0.48, there may be further declines. The coin’s movement shows both potential growth and risks ahead. Aptos faces decline but nears potential rebound levels Aptos (APT) has declined by 14.11% in the past week, with prices ranging from $12.79 to $15.83. The token is approaching its support level at $11.03, suggesting a possible rebound. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 30.87, indicating that APT is nearing oversold territory. This could lead to a price recovery towards the resistance level at $17.12, offering a notable increase from current levels. However, the MACD is negative at -0.55, pointing to continued bearish momentum. Investors are watching for the price to move above the 100-day Simple Moving Average of $14.02, which may signal a shift towards growth. Cardano faces downtrend but nears key support levels Cardano (ADA) has experienced a recent drop, with a 1-week price change of -16.38%. Trading between $1.06 and $1.33, it is approaching the nearest support level at $0.92. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 34.27, indicating that the coin is nearing oversold conditions. The MACD level is negative at -0.039, suggesting continued downward momentum. Despite this, the coin has seen a 1-month gain of 102.41%, showing potential for a rebound. If the price holds above the support level, it could target the nearest resistance at $1.46, offering a possible upward move. Investors are watching these levels closely to assess Cardano’s next direction. Conclusion While established altcoins like SOL, POL, APT, and ADA continue to show promise, their short-term potential appears limited. In contrast, CYBRO emerges as a technologically advanced DeFi platform offering investors exceptional opportunities to maximize earnings through AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain. With features such as generous staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases, CYBRO provides a superior user experience with seamless deposits and withdrawals. By prioritizing transparency, compliance, and quality, CYBRO distinguishes itself as a promising project attracting significant interest from crypto whales and influencers.

37517814,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=626083,1733948157,Goldman Sachs wants to invest in Bitcoin and Ethereum,"Goldman Sachs is eyeing the Bitcoin and Ethereum markets. CEO David Solomon said the Wall Street firm is ready to “evaluate” its entry, but only if regulators clear the path. Solomon made the statement during a Reuters event on Tuesday. His comments come as Bitcoin hit over $100,000 last week, driven by optimism about crypto’s future under President-elect Donald Trump. Solomon noted that regulatory changes are expected but remain uncertain. “There’s a view that the regulatory framework is going to evolve differently than it seemed under the last administration,” he said. Goldman Sachs has been exploring blockchain technology for years, launching its GS DAP tokenization platform in 2022 and testing the Canton Network, which focuses on institutional asset interoperability. Goldman expects growth in M&A and private equity Solomon also discussed expectations for a rebound in mergers and acquisitions (M&A). He said dealmaking in M&A and equity markets might exceed the 10-year average by 2025. Private equity buyouts have lagged recently, but he expects activity to pick up next year. The firm has seen its investment banking division recover over the past year, although private equity deals have been slow. Hedge funds, on the other hand, are showing growing interest in crypto products. Goldman has noted increasing demand from these clients, reflecting a shift in traditional finance toward blockchain-based assets. Goldman Sachs stock (NYSE:GS) slipped 0.4% on Tuesday, while Bitcoin dropped 3.3% to $94.6K. Ethereum prices also saw slight declines, but the broader market remains optimistic. Institutional players are closely watching developments as firms ramp up applications for crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Many believe the SEC could approve these ETFs under the new administration. Trump’s tariffs could reshape inflation and rates Trump’s plans for new tariffs are another factor affecting markets. On Monday, he proposed a 10% tariff on goods from China and a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico. According to Goldman’s chief economist Jan Hatzius, these moves could push inflation higher. “Using our rule of thumb, every 1% increase in tariff rates raises core PCE by 0.1%. If implemented, the proposed tariffs could boost core PCE by 0.9%,” Hatzius explained. Core PCE, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure, was already at 2.8% in October, above the Fed’s 2% target. The new tariffs could make it harder for the Fed to consider rate cuts in 2025. Hatzius added that the tariffs could generate nearly $300 billion in revenue annually, with China bearing the brunt. Canada and Mexico may avoid blanket tariffs, depending on Trump’s conditions regarding immigration and drug enforcement. However, these tariffs remain proposals, with exceptions and negotiations likely. Market expectations for Fed rate cuts in 2025 have cooled, partly due to a stronger U.S. economy and the uncertainty surrounding new fiscal policies. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank would consider the impact of these policies on inflation before making decisions.

Speaking about the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, Mester noted that although the report met expectations, it revealed a worrying pause in the progress of inflation, which could affect the FED's future decisions. “The unfortunate thing is that it shows that we have a pause in the progress that was made on inflation,” Mester said. “That is a concern for the Fed because inflation has made very little progress over the last four months.” The September summary of economic forecasts (SEP) had called for one rate cut by year-end and four more rate cuts totaling 100 basis points in 2024. However, Mester believes that forecast may no longer be in line with the current economic environment. He calls for a “review” of the policy path for next year, citing continued economic momentum and inflationary pressures despite earlier signs of improvement. Mester confirmed the possibility that inflation will run higher than previously anticipated, which may require a tighter policy stance. While the Fed's dual mandate includes maximizing employment, Mester argued that the risk to employment has diminished, allowing the Fed to focus more on combating inflation. Related News: Analyst Who Predicted 2024 Bulls Correctly Shares Bitcoin Price Prediction for 2025 Mester also noted the role of base effects and projections for early 2025, predicting that inflation could ease in the first quarter due to favorable year-over-year comparisons. However, he warned that inflation has been on a bumpy path and may require a more restrictive policy stance than the Fed had anticipated in September. “Reaching inflation targets will probably take a little bit longer and require more restrictive policy,” the former Fed member said. While the Fed initially projected four rate cuts in 2025, Mester now expects that number to be reduced to two or three, in line with changing economic realities. Mester also noted that the Fed could cut rates in December but that it would be important to pause in January to reassess the situation. “The December meeting provides an opportunity to assess progress made and set a tighter policy path for 2026,” he said, adding that Fed Chair Jerome Powell could use the upcoming press conference to clarify future strategies. “The modal forecast is for inflation to continue to fall, but achieving that will likely require tighter interest rates than initially expected,” Mester said. *This is not investment advice.

37532160,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=374247,1733947572,Circle and Binance Partner to Drive Global USDC Adoption and Battle USDT,"On Wednesday morning in Abu Dhabi, Binance and Circle announced a strategic partnership to promote USDC, a stablecoin jointly owned by Circle and Coinbase. The collaboration comes as stablecoins gain traction in mainstream finance and competitors seek to challenge the dominance of market leader Tether. The Alliance Details about revenue sharing in this arrangement remain undisclosed, though sources informed Fortune that Binance will not acquire an equity stake in Circle. According to the press release, the partnership aims to expand the worldwide adoption of USDC. Binance will incorporate USDC into its full suite of products and services, offering its 240 million global users access to the stablecoin for trading, saving, and payment applications. As part of the agreement, Binance will adopt USDC as a core component of its corporate treasury. On the other hand, Circle will support Binance by providing the necessary technology, liquidity, and tools to enable user access to USDC while also working to strengthen relationships across global finance and commerce. Coinbase welcomed the development, with Shan Aggarwal, its Vice President and Head of Business Development, stating, “As the list of USDC ecosystem partners expands, USDC circulation will continue to grow, helping to increase economic freedom around the world and lead the industry forward on a foundation of transparency and trust.” Jeremy Allaire, Chairman and CEO of Circle, highlighted Binance’s innovation and its potential to make USDC a household name on its platform. Richard Teng, CEO of Binance, announced the exchanges plans of introducing more USDC trading pairs, special promotions, and new use cases for stablecoins globally. Battle for Dominance The stablecoin market is currently dominated by Tether, which holds a $138 billion market cap, significantly ahead of USDC at $40 billion. Despite allegations of questionable accounting practices and links to illicit activities, the firm remains a key player in the market. Binance was previously a major competitor, with its native BUSD reaching a $23 billion market cap. However, regulatory pressure in 2023 forced it to wind down operations. Circle, during this period, criticized Binance and Tether as lacking compliance. The latest partnership marks a shift in their relationship. After settling regulatory issues with the U.S. Justice Department, Binance has committed to an oversight regime, making it possible for the exchange to align with Circle’s regulated and trusted USDC. However, this collaboration involves revenue-sharing arrangements among the three companies, potentially complicating efforts to unseat Tether’s dominance. Meanwhile, other competitors are making moves to challenge the leading stablecoin issuer. Robinhood, Galaxy Digital, Kraken and Paxos, recently formed a consortium supporting the latest stablecoin offering (USDG) issued by Paxos. In a November 5 statement, the company shared that the new ‘Global Dollar Network’ was designed to accelerate the global adoption and use of these assets worldwide.

Pepe Loves Santa (PEPESAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPESAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Loves Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Loves Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Loves Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Loves Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Loves Santa by entering its contract address – 9FuN9o4pQgF3NF1v2saWvb7b9hNKDJ1DGU6LSbur437Q – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPESAN.

At the same time, the focus is also on Solana (SOL) and an upcoming DeFi coin called DTX Exchange (DTX) . Analysts forecast the value of Solana could surge to $300. One of the biggest gainers of this bull run, DTX, has increased by 500% but is poised to crack the $1 mark before the end of this cycle. Dogecoin (DOGE) Still Early in Bull Cycle, Might Rally To $3 In a recent tweet, top analyst Ali Martinez reiterated his bullish forecast for the Dogecoin crypto. According to Martinez, he would keep buying the dip as DOGE is still early in its bull cycle. Also, he predicts the price of Dogecoin (DOGE) could pump to $3 in the coming weeks. The chart Martinez posted alongside his tweet showed the meme coin was trading in an ascending channel. If the Dogecoin token reaches the upper part of the channel, its value could rise to $18. In the meantime, the Dogecoin price has been trading between $0.3987 and $0.4758 in the past seven days. CoinMarketCap data shows its price has dropped by 1.7% in the past week. However, it has risen by 82.4% in the past month. Besides, the sentiment surrounding the cryptocurrency is bullish. The 14-day RSI is above the midline, which is a bullish signal. Solana (SOL) Could Pump To $300, Says Analysts Solana (SOL) is one of the top altcoins whose price has dropped alongside the latest correction in the crypto market. The altcoin has been on a downtrend since it climbed to a breakout all-time high of $263.83 last month. Presently, the value of the Solana coin has dropped by 7.4% in the last week. Also, it has plunged by 11.7% in the last two weeks, signaling high bearish pressure. Nevertheless, analysts are optimistic the Solana token could recover in the coming weeks. One of such analysts is The Cryptomist. She told her followers not to miss out on the Solana crypto as a breakout could occur soon. According to The Cryptomist, Solana (SOL) is trading within an ascending triangle and could rise to $300 in the case of a breakout. DTX Exchange (DTX): A Revolutionary Trading Platform DTX Exchange (DTX) is a unique trading platform that offers users a pool of over 120,000 assets, including cryptocurrencies, stocks, indices, bonds, and commodities to trade. This puts DTX in the $714.7 trillion OTC derivatives market for higher liquidity and will allow traders to monitor their investments without having to open other accounts or use other platforms. Privacy is another key feature of DTX because it does not require users to go through the KYC procedure. Customers can transact without revealing their identity. Also, registration is simple and fast. The native DTX token is a valuable addition. Holders get to pay less for trading fees, have the right to vote, and have access to advanced trading tools. Based on its features, a large number of tradable assets, and the focus on privacy, DTX Exchange has all the potential to transform the trading market. The current presale has attracted a lot of attention from investors. The DTX coin is currently selling at $0.12. The project has already raised more than $10 million and analysts predict that the token’s price may rise by 10x to cross $1 in this bull market. Final Thoughts While Dogecoin (DOGE) is gearing up to head the memecoin market charge, Solana (SOL) is preparing to rally to $300. DTX Exchange is also preparing for a massive surge in the coming weeks, positioning it among the best altcoins to watch.

But things could get even crazier in 2025, according to Bitwise Asset Management, a firm which specializes in developing crypto investment products. The company laid out 10 crypto predictions for the year to come in a report released Wednesday, penned by the firm's chief investment officer, Matt Hougan, and its head of research, Ryan Rasmussen.  First among the predictions is that all major cryptocurrencies will see new record highs. Bitcoin will push to $200,000, said Bitwise, while ether will hit $7,000 and solana will more than triple to $750.  Bitcoin’s rise will be fueled by even bigger ETF inflows than in 2024, Bitwise said. That's a strong statement given their success already, but the team noted that it's not unusual fo ETFs to take in larger flows in year two versus year one. They also remind that major wirehouses are only now finishing up their due diligence on the products and investors are feeling more comfortable increasing their exposure to bitcoin.  There’s also the possibility that the U.S. Department of Labor won’t be so adversarial towards the sector anymore, which according to Bitwise could enable tens of billions of dollars to flow into crypto assets from 401(k) plans.  And a potential bitcoin arms race — kicked off by U.S. politicians’ plans to constitute a strategic bitcoin reserve — would certainly help move the price upwards. Bitwise predicted that the number of countries holding bitcoin will double in 2025 from nine to eighteen.  Other possibilities for 2025  Stablecoins will likely benefit from clear legislation in the U.S. and fintech integrations, as well as rising prices, and double their market capitalization to $400 billion, according to Bitwise.  Tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), meanwhile, could see their value shoot past $50 billion as Wall Street keeps wading deeper into the sector.  And the 2025 memecoin mania could even top this year’s, as AI agents are making it easier than ever to launch tokens.  Crypto companies will also have a good year, Bitwise predicted. A host of them could launch IPOs, Bitwise said, with stablecoin issuer Circle, crypto lending firm Figure, on-chain data company Chainalysis, crypto exchange Kraken and crypto custodian Anchorage Digital as the most likely to do so.  Already public for several years, crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) could see its stock top $700 per share, or more than double the current level, Bitwise said, meaning it would surpass Charles Schwab as the most valuable brokerage in the world.  Further, suggests Bitwise, it could mean that Coinbase could be included in the S&P 500. Coupled with MicroStrategy's likely inclusion into the Nasdaq 100, there’s a chance that almost every U.S. investor will have exposure to crypto through these investment vehicles.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | SOL | TRADING,Tom Carreras,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/11/bitcoin-going-to-200-k-coinbase-to-join-s-and-p-500-bitwises-10-predictions-for-2025,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/18172463a019e513e643fd2ed9ab0e0806baf68b-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Consumer Price Index (CPI) data could pave the way for rate cuts next week BREAKING! US headline #inflation rose to 2.7% in November, matching expectations. Core inflation was stable at 3.3%, which was also in line with expectations. This should be enough for the #FederalReserve to cut rates again in December. pic.twitter.com/eLut3iSMtG — jeroen blokland (@jsblokland) December 11, 2024 The rising inflation data could signal a good chance of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve next week. According to CME Group’s FedWatch tool , traders anticipate an 86% chance that the Fed will cut rates in its next meeting. On December 18th, the Fed will announce the next interest rate decision, share other economic data points, and discuss the current U.S. economic outlook. The November producer price index (PPI) numbers come a day after the consumer price index. PPI tracks wholesale inflation and is set to be released on Thursday. Market participants anticipate that the MoM PPI numbers will decrease from 0.3% to 0.2% while the YoY PPI figures will increase from 3.1% to 3.3%. The U.S. Treasury yields rose on Tuesday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury was up more than 3 basis points to 4.23%, while the 2-year Treasury also rose more than 2 basis points to 4.149%. On December 10th, Michael Green, the chief strategist at Simplify Asset Management, told CNBC that the market experienced a weak bond auction, yet it was neither terrible nor great. He cited confusion and uncertainty about today’s CPI numbers as the reason for the weak bond market. The core CPI numbers track inflation but exclude volatile items like food and energy prices, providing a more stable measure of underlying inflation trends. On the other hand, the standard CPI includes all inflation-tracking items, such as goods and services, reflecting overall price changes across the economy. MoM Producer Price Index set to increase from 0.2% to 0.3% The MoM PPI figures are set to increase from 0.2% to 0.3%, while the YoY PPI numbers are expected to increase from 3.1% to 3.3%. On the other hand, the Core MoM PPI figures are set to decrease from 0.3% to 0.2%, while the Core YoY PPI numbers are expected to increase from 3.1% to 3.3%. Potential policy changes in the U.S. and Canada could reset market expectations, with investors on edge. As the U.S. prepares for inflation-driven changes, Canada’s employment concerns have projected rate cuts that might further weaken the dollar. The Fed is currently in a blackout period and is restricted from making public statements before the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting. Therefore, Fed officials will not provide any commentary regarding the central bank’s next move. In the November FOMC meeting, the committee reduced the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4.50%—4.75%, continuing the interest-rate-cutting cycle that started in September.

In a Dec. 10 X post, Scam Sniffer revealed that fraudsters are creating fake X accounts to impersonate well-known crypto influencers. They then invite users to join Telegram groups under the guise of offering exclusive investment insights. Once inside the Telegram group, users are prompted to verify their identities through “OfficiaISafeguardBot,” a fraudulent verification bot. According to Scam Sniffer, this bot “creates artificial urgency” by imposing short timeframes for verification. How the Scam Works The fake bot injects malicious PowerShell code into victims’ systems, downloading and running malware designed to compromise both computer systems and crypto wallets. Scam Sniffer reported “numerous cases” of this malware being used to steal private keys, enabling the theft of cryptocurrency. The security firm explained that the recent known cases of this scam were all linked to the fake verification bot. “It’s currently unclear if there are other malicious bots. However, it’s obviously simple for them to impersonate others as well,” Scam Sniffer told Cointelegraph. Sophisticated Infrastructure Behind the Scam Scam Sniffer noted that while malware targeting everyday users has existed for a long time, the infrastructure supporting such scams is “developing rapidly” and becoming increasingly “sophisticated.” The firm likened this evolution to a “scam-as-a-service” model, where creators of crypto wallet-draining malware provide their tools to phishing scammers for profit. Although malware distribution via Telegram and impersonation scams are not new, Scam Sniffer stated, “This is the first time we’re seeing this specific combination of fake X accounts, fake Telegram channels, and malicious Telegram bots.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/scammers-use-telegram-bots-to-steal-crypto-wallet-funds/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

The younger Trump, who serves as executive vice president of the Trump Organization, attended a Bitcoin ( BTC ) conference in Abu Dhabi this week. He tells CNBC that he and his father, President-elect Donald Trump, have been big fans of crypto “for a long time.” “I think he realizes that every country in the world is embracing it. Look at where we are right now in Abu Dhabi. They’re putting billions of dollars into crypto and into digital technologies, and if we don’t do it as America, we’re going to be left behind. He wants to make America the crypto capital of the world. He’s been very, very clear with that, and I applaud that.” Trump says there are existing inefficiencies in the financial system, noting, for example, that it often takes Americans 90 days to secure a home loan. “There is nothing on blockchain that can’t be done better, faster, substantially cheaper… the banking system that we have around the world, the modern banking system, is antiquated.

I'm Marc Hochstein, CoinDesk's deputy editor-in-chief for features, opinion and standards.  In this issue:  What does Google's quantum computing chip mean for Bitcoin?  Dev's defection highlights Ethereum's growing Solana problem  OrdinalsBot inscribes largest-ever file on Bitcoin blockchain  Polygon touts speed of Plonky3 proving system  Crypto's most influential techies of 2024  Network News  NEED FOR SPEED: Polygon Labs claims its newest proving system, Plonky3, is the fastest on the market. (Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum's creator, apparently agrees.) A proving system is at the core of zero-knowledge rollups, and a crucial component for transactions that rely on cryptographic security. It is the main piece of technology that creates proofs that summarize off-chain transactions, which are then sent back to a base blockchain (in this case, Ethereum). “If a zkVM is a car, you could look at the proving system as being the engine, so Plonky3 is kind of what makes everything work,” Brendan Farmer, a co-founder at Polygon, tells CoinDesk's Margaux Nijkerk. The quicker a proof is generated, the less computing time that must be paid for. “If we improve speed, then we're improving costs,” Farmer said. “And so what this does is it makes ZK rollup really competitive in terms of costs.” In January 2022, Polygon released its previous proving system, called Plonky2, claiming then that it was the fastest one on the market. Plonky3, the new and improved version that has more flexibility, was released in July.  IN AWE OF THE SIZE OF THIS LAD: Bitcoin inscriptions project OrdinalsBot minted what it says is the largest file ever on the oldest and most valuable blockchain: the last in a collection of 1,500 ""Pizza Ninjas."" It's part of a phenomenon in the Bitcoin development community known as ""four meggers,"" which are files that take up an entire block on the network. They are called four meggers because they are almost 4 megabytes (MB) big (the maximum size of each block of transactions on Bitcoin). Ordinal collectors consider them valuable due to their visibility on the blockchain. ""There's more than just bragging rights behind wanting to have the largest file on Bitcoin,"" said Toby Lewis, co-founder of OrdinalsBot. ""Four meggers will be on the Bitcoin blockchain forever and they already hold significant market value."" Bitcoin inscriptions, similar to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Ethereum, were made possible by the Ordinals protocol. It allows data to be ""inscribed"" onto individual satoshis, or ""sats"" (the smallest unit of BTC at 1/100,000,000 of a full bitcoin), making each one unique and potentially valuable. Read more.  JUMPING SHIP: Ethereum's place near the top of the crypto market is unquestioned from the perspective of market cap. Beneath the surface – at the product, developer and decision-making levels – the original smart contracts platform continues to take a beating from Solana, one of its closest competitors. Ethereum and its many closely-linked networks are still the most important, influential, and largest platforms for decentralized finance. That lead is beginning to erode, however, with many newcomers to crypto choosing Solana's speed and low fees. The dynamic was further punctuated Monday with news that longtime Ethereum ecosystem developer Max Resnick was moving into Solana's orbit, abandoning his job at the developer studio Consensys. ""There's just so much more possibility and potential energy in Solana,"" Resnick said in an interview with CoinDesk. He framed the decision as rooted in his own career path, but noted ""frustration"" with Ethereum's inability to adapt contributed to the move. Ethereum lacks a streamlined process for making quick changes. Some see that as a point of strength for a decentralized network, while others, like Resnick, see it as a hindrance for long-term success.

Most Influential highlights personal achievements in the last calendar year. People are chosen for their projects, ideas, leadership, personality, or notoriety. There is a top 10 of the most Most Influential – people we feel had outsize influence or led the most important projects. Then, we profile another 40 people who were only a little less influential. (Certain prominent people in crypto – Vitalik Buterin, say – would naturally be Most Influential every year. But we choose not to feature the same names each time.)

(Writing that last piece was downright cathartic for me.) Find all the profiles here.  WHAT DOES GOOGLE'S QUANTUM COMPUTING CHIP MEAN FOR BITCOIN?  Google’s new quantum computing chip could mean bitcoin (BTC) is finished.  That was the sentiment for some on Monday as the internet giant unveiled Willow, a quantum supercomputer that can perform certain computational tasks in just five minutes that would take classical supercomputers an astronomical amount of time—specifically, 10 septillion years (or one followed by 24 zeroes; a trillion trillion).  10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. Such an amount of time is greater than the existence of the entire universe at 13.8 billion years.  In superficial theory, such a powerful computer could mean no passwords are safe, encrypted messages are intercepted, nuclear weapons codes are found out, and almost anything can be unlocked by brute-forcing combinations of numbers and letters.  But it isn’t all doom and gloom yet.  While quantum computing does indeed pose significant threats to current security systems, it's not a master key to the universe, at least not right now. And there is no looming threat to Bitcoin, either.  Quantum computing leverages the principles of quantum mechanics, using quantum bits or qubits instead of traditional bits. Unlike bits which represent either a 0 or 1, qubits can represent both 0 and 1 simultaneously due to quantum phenomena like superposition and entanglement. This allows quantum computers to perform multiple calculations at once, potentially solving problems that are currently intractable for classical computers. Willow uses 105 qubits and demonstrates an exponential error reduction as the number of qubits increases. This is a critical step towards building a practical, large-scale quantum computer, said Google CEO Sundar Pichai.  Bitcoin uses algorithms like SHA-256 for mining and ECDSA for signatures, which might be vulnerable to quantum decryption. And the short answer is that quantum computers, even advanced ones like Google's Willow, do not possess the scale or error correction capabilities needed to immediately decrypt widely used encryption methods like RSA, ECC (used in Bitcoin transactions), or AES (used in securing data).  If quantum computers like Willow reach a scale where they can easily factor in large numbers, they could potentially break these encryption schemes, compromising wallet security and transaction integrity. That would require quantum computers with millions or even billions of “qubits” with extremely low error rates, far beyond the current technology.  “Google claims to have demonstrated 'below threshold' error correcting capabilities with their latest quantum chip,” said Chris Osborn, founder at Solana ecosystem project Dialect, in a post on X (formerly Twitter). ""'Below threshold' is industry jargon for turning physical qubits, which are noisy, s*itty quantum bits that are basically useless, into logical qubits, which are multi-qubit abstractions that correct for errors & let you actually perform real computation.” he added.  It takes roughly 5,000 logical qubits ""to run Shor's algorithm to break encryption. In other words, millions of physical qubits are needed to break encryption. Google's chip today: 105 physical qubits,” Osborn noted.  Until then, cryptocurrencies (and other sectors) have time to develop quantum-resistant algorithms.

37516645,https://crypto.news/?p=14318538,1733946322,Chainlink vs. Lightchain AI: A race to redefine the blockchain landscape,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Blockchain is evolving rapidly, with DeFi, AI, and new consensus mechanisms shaping 2025. Can Lightchain AI rival Chainlink? Change is happening fast in the world of blockchain. Between decentralized finance (DeFi) innovations, new consensus mechanisms, and the rise of AI integration, it’s becoming clear that 2025 will be a pivotal year for the industry. Chainlink (LINK), already a well-established player, continues to make headlines as a leader in blockchain oracles. Yet, an intriguing newcomer, Lightchain AI, with its unique combination of blockchain and artificial intelligence, has emerged as a potential disruptor. By examining Lightchain AI ‘s ambitious technology stack alongside Chainlink’s current trajectory, we’ll explore whether LINK’s reign remains unchallenged or if Lightchain AI could redefine the blockchain landscape altogether.

Decentralized Governance: Empowers the community to vote and actively contribute to ecosystem changes. If AI has a future on the blockchain, Lightchain AI is laying the groundwork for it today. Chainlink: The current titan Chainlink (LINK) has long been synonymous with blockchain oracles, providing smart contracts with real-world data. Its relevance continues to grow, especially in DeFi, where reliable data inputs—like crypto price feeds—are crucial. Chainlink’s hybrid smart contracts and decentralized oracle network make it a dominant force. With a current price of $24.81, LINK remains a key player across multiple verticals, including insurance, gaming, and asset management. But with little emphasis on AI, could it be falling behind in what may be the next major frontier of blockchain innovation? Weekly chainlink price predictions Understanding where LINK stands in 2025 starts with its price trajectory. Based on current trends and relevant data, here are estimated weekly price predictions for the next month: Week 1: $25.50 Week 2: $26.30 Week 3: $27.10 Week 4: $28.00 Why the steady growth? Chainlink continues to expand its partnerships and integrations, reinforcing its position as a critical infrastructure provider in DeFi and beyond. However, the lack of AI integration could make it vulnerable to emerging competitors like Lightchain AI. How does Lightchain AI compare to Chainlink? When assessing these two blockchain solutions, let’s break it down across key areas: 1. Technology Lightchain AI: Supports unique AI workloads with PoI and AIVM, creating synergy between blockchain and artificial intelligence. Chainlink: Offers unparalleled real-world data integrations for smart contracts but lacks specific features tailored to AI. Verdict: Lightchain AI pushes the boundaries of blockchain tech with its AI-first approach, but Chainlink’s maturity and battle-tested technology keep it ahead for now. 2. Ecosystem growth Lightchain AI: Just launching, but its potential for integrating AI with blockchain is drawing considerable interest. Chainlink: Widely adopted with thousands of oracles actively used in blockchain solutions globally. Verdict: Lightchain AI’s ecosystem is nascent but promising, while Chainlink’s adoption levels are likely unmatched for the foreseeable future. 3. Community and rewards Lightchain AI: PoI and decentralized governance underscore its commitment to community involvement. Its gamified contribution model incentivizes meaningful participation. Chainlink: LINK token holders stake their tokens for rewards, ensuring alignment with the network. Verdict: Lightchain AI’s community-centric governance is bold and creativity, while Chainlink relies on its established staking ecosystem. Can Lightchain AI redefine blockchain’s future? Lightchain AI’s ambitions signal an exciting new direction for blockchain, particularly for enterprises looking to adopt decentralized AI solutions. With its PoI model and AIVM, Lightchain AI is addressing some of the most pressing challenges in AI development, including transparency, scalability, and computational cost. Combine this with blockchain’s security and decentralization, and it’s clear why Lightchain AI could be a game-changing disruptor. Key takeaways Chainlink is poised to maintain its leadership in traditional oracle services, dominating industries like DeFi and asset management. Its strength lies in its robust technology and extensive adoption. Lightchain AI represents the next evolution of blockchain technology, blending powerful AI features with decentralized governance. With its low presale price of $0.001125, it offers unmatched entry-level affordability for early adopters.

Coinbase announced adding Peanut the Squirrel ( PNUT ) to the roadmap, triggering a more than 31% gain Wednesday. PNUT is trading for $1.34 at time of writing. With a market cap of $1.3 billion, the memecoin is the 111th largest crypto project. Coinbase uses the listing roadmap for transparency and to prevent insider trading on coins prior to them being listed. Being placed on the listing roadmap means the firm has determined the asset will likely be available for trading in the future. PNUT is just one of several memecoins Coinbase has to its platform for trading in recent weeks. Others include Gigachad ( GIGA ), a crypto asset inspired by the photo shoot of Russian bodybuilder Ernest Khalimov, Turbo ( TURBO ), a GPT-4 inspired memecoin, MOG Coin ( MOG ), a memecoin available on both the Ethereum ( ETH ) and Base blockchains, and Moo Deng ( MOODENG ), a Solana-based memecoin. Last month, the world’s top exchange Binance listed PNUT for trading and the memecoin surged by more than 320%. PNUT is inspired by the squirrel rescued by a New York family named Peanut. The squirrel became popular on the family’s TikTok videos and Instagram, but New York wildlife officials seized the animal based on state laws that prohibit keeping squirrels as pets. The squirrel was euthanized on October 30th, which became a viral incident.

37516497,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=626176,1733945746,Will the FED cut rates tomorrow? Here’s what the inflation data is pointing to,"A FED economic report, expected to be released on December 12, could highlight stalled progress in curbing inflation in the United States. Economists are uncertain whether the data will dissuade the Federal Reserve from implementing a widely expected interest rate cut during its policy meeting next week. According to recent updates from Trading Economics, the annual inflation rate in November has climbed to an expected 2.7%, a modest increase from October’s 2.6%, marking the second consecutive month of rising inflation. BREAKING: November CPI inflation RISES to 2.7%, in-line with expectations of 2.7%. Core CPI inflation was 3.3%, in-line with expectations of 3.3%. Headline CPI inflation is now at its highest level since July 2024. Inflation has leveled off above the Fed's 2% target. — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) December 11, 2024 Analysts attribute part of the uptick to low base effects from the previous year. On a month-to-month basis, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is forecast to rise by 0.3%, surpassing October’s 0.2% increase and marking the highest monthly gain since April. The CPI rise, per a CNBC report , is primarily driven by higher prices for used cars, airfares, apparel, and car insurance. Gasoline prices, in contrast, are expected to show a slight decline. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, remained steady at 3.3% year-over-year, with monthly core inflation also holding at 0.3%, matching the rate observed in October. CPI index suggests US inflation numbers will go up The CPI, a broad measure of the cost of goods and services across the U.S. economy, serves as a key gauge of inflationary pressures. The Dow Jones consensus estimate aligns with other forecasts, showing a 2.7% year-over-year increase in November’s CPI. This slight acceleration would challenge the Federal Reserve’s goal of achieving its target inflation rate of 2%. “ Looking at these measures, there’s nothing in there that says the inflation dragon has been slain ,” commented Dan North, senior economist at Allianz Trade Americas. “ Inflation is still here, and it doesn’t show any convincing moves towards 2% .” The upcoming inflation report will be closely followed by another significant data release: the Producer Price Index (PPI). Scheduled for December 14, the PPI, which tracks wholesale prices, is expected to show a modest 0.2% monthly gain. Together, these reports will provide critical insights into the current trajectory of inflation in the U.S. Opinion poll: Federal reserve’s could cut rates Despite the stubborn inflation figures, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to lower interest rates by 25 basis points at its December 18 meeting. This would bring the federal funds rate to a range of 4.25% to 4.50%. According to a Reuters poll , 90% of economists anticipate the rate cut, bolstered by recent labor market data that signaled cooling but resilient conditions. The Fed will likely cut rates next week even though inflation is running at over 3% annually. Why? I have no idea. Because the market wants it? It’s become a clown show at this point. Theres no justifiable reason to cut rates imo. But they will. — QE Infinity (@StealthQE4) December 11, 2024 The U.S. job market’s slower pace of growth, alongside steady income and employment gains, has reassured policymakers that the economy can withstand another rate cut before the Fed takes stock of potential shifts in government policy next year. “ With the jobs report showing more slack despite solid income and job gains, we reiterate our call for another 25bp Fed cut in December ,” said Jonathan Millar, senior U.S. economist at Barclays. Miller believes interest rate futures have already priced at a likelihood of a quarter-point reduction. Future monetary policy views Meanwhile, a majority of surveyed analysts believe the Fed will hold rates steady at its January meeting, scheduled just over a week after President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20. Concerns about rising inflation risks under Trump’s proposed economic policies , including import tariffs and tax cuts, could influence the central bank’s decisions. “They (the Fed) are going to wait to see what happens next year, what is actually implemented versus what is kind of presented as a risk,” noted Stephen Juneau, a U.S. economist at Bank of America. The Federal Reserve’s long-term goal is to bring interest rates to a neutral level, estimated at around 2.9%. Fed Chair Jerome Powell recently stated that policymakers “can afford to be a little more cautious” as they strive to find a neutral rate, citing a stronger-than-expected economy and inflation rates exceeding earlier forecasts. The U.S. economy expanded at an annualized rate of 2.8% in the last quarter, and economists forecast growth of 2.1% in 2025 and 2% in 2026. These rates surpass the Federal Reserve’s estimate of the non-inflationary growth rate of 1.8% over the coming years. However, inflation concerns persist. From a majority of financial economic experts polled by Reuters, 75% believe there is a high risk of inflation resurging next year. Moreover, David Seif, Nomura’s senior economist for developed markets, cautioned that core inflation could rise significantly above 3% by mid-2025. Seif linked the rise to higher tariffs and potential supply chain disruptions likely to result from aggressive trade policies under the incoming Trump administration .

According to the report , the V3 aims to enhance liquidity, provide new developer tools, and drive growth in trading volume. Besides the unveiling, the exchange has also collaborated with the decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol, Aave. A previous collaboration with Balancer offered rewards from a stablecoin pool to incentivize liquidity providers. Boosted Pools: A Game-Changer for Liquidity and Yield Aave functions as the leading launch partner with plans for others in the future. Notably, Balance V3 introduces 100% Boosted Pools, and this collaboration fuses its unique permissionless automated market technology with Aave’s market infrastructure. The overall goal is to combine the yield from swaps and lending markets into one entity. Fernando Martinelli, Balancer’s co-founder, described the collaboration as historic for both parties. Martinelli assured them they would deliver a liquidity solution that everyone in DeFi can access and remain efficient and scalable. The platform has been structured so that liquidity providers can optimize returns with a single click. They also can have access to DeFi’s markets without needing active management. This significant development for Balancer went live on Ethereum’s Layer 2 scaling solution , Optimism. 2022 Developer-Friendly Enhancements and Broader DeFi Impact Speaking on yield generation, Stani Kulechov, Aave Labs Founder, noted that combining the strengths of both entities, the evolved Aave V3 Boosted Pool will empower users. Primarily, users will have access to enhanced capital efficiency and simplified yield generation. As users earn, they can easily access both supply and swap functions with minimal transaction costs. For clarification, Balancer supports portfolio management and trading in the crypto space for Ethereum and EVM-aligned blockchains. Its structure allows DeFI projects to develop custom pools suitable to their needs. Hence, the V3 upgrade will build on this to eliminate challenges that impede developers. With it, developers on the platform can innovate quickly and seamlessly. Promising Future for DeFi Collaboration According to the development team, some new features include custom pool types and Hooks Framework. The former will enhance building AMMs faster and more accessible while the latter extends existing pools’ functionality. Beyond Aave, Balancer says the V3 has gained traction and received interest from other DeFi protocols like Gyroscope and QuantAMM. Leading industry stakeholders such as Trail of Bits, Spearbit, and Certora audited Balancer V3.

37516250,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=374303,1733945629,Top Ethereum (ETH) Price Predictions: New ATH or Another Severe Correction?,"TL;DR Analysts predict ETH could hit $5,000 or even $10,000, with key resistance at $3,750 signaling a potential breakout. Rising daily active addresses and positive network growth suggest increasing Ethereum adoption, supporting a bullish outlook. Where’s ETH Headed Next? The second-largest cryptocurrency was on a tear last week, with its price briefly surpassing $4,000 on December 6. This was the highest level witnessed since March 2024. Since then, though, ETH started losing steam, tumbling to approximately $3,500 amid the latest market correction observed at the start of the new business week. In the past several hours, the bulls have prevented a further fall, pushing the price to the current $3,720 (per CoinGecko’s data). ETH Price, Source: CoinGecko Despite ETH’s wobbly performance as of late , multiple analysts remain optimistic that the asset has yet to record fresh peaks. The popular trader using the X moniker CoinMamba predicted a new all-time high of $5,000 before the end of 2024. My target for $ETH is still $5k by the end of this year. Do what you will with that information.. — CoinMamba (@coinmamba) December 10, 2024 X user Skew also envisioned a potential pump for ETH if it reclaims the $3,750 resistance level. However, the trader remains rather pessimistic if the valuation drops below $3,500. Crypto Patel presented a bullish scenario, according to which ETH’s price may skyrocket to a new ATH of $10,000. The X user also assumed there is a chance for a potential crash to the $2,500-$2,800 range, describing it as “the perfect accumulation zone.” What Are On-Chain Metrics Signaling? Some essential indicators suggest that ETH could indeed be poised for an upside move. One example is the increase in Ethereum’s daily active addresses. According to IntoTheBlock, the figure has jumped by almost 7% on a 24-hour scale, surpassing 600,000. This resurgence usually suggests growing usage of the Ethereum blockchain, which , in turn, could lead to a price spike. Another metric on the rise is the Net Network Growth (a momentum signal “that gives a pulse of the true growth of the token’s underlying network”). It is up 0.30% daily , entering the bullish zone. On the other hand, the “In the Money” indicator, which measures the change in the number of ETH investors currently sitting on paper profits, is slightly down for the same period. As of writing these lines, around 89% of those exposed to the asset are in the green, while only 8% are underwater.

37516151,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=660635,1733945451,"Bitcoin CME Chart Shows Striking Similarities To 2023, Here’s What Happened Last Time","A crypto analyst has unveiled uncanny similarities between Bitcoin’s Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) chart from late Q4 2024 and 2023. According to the analyst’s report, the 2024 Bitcoin CME chart replicates the price action seen in 2023, experiencing similar technical patterns, wave structures, price movements, and specific key indicators. Bitcoin CME Chart Mirrors 2023 Price Action A comparative analysis of the Bitcoin CME charts from Nov/Dec 2023 and Nov/Dec 2024 reveals striking parallels. The charts, shared on X (formerly Twitter) by crypto analyst and market technician Tony Severino, feature a near-identical Elliott Wave count, showcasing five distinct waves that indicate classical bullish patterns. Related Reading: XRP Price: Analyst’s ABC Correction Forecast Plays Out Perfectly, Second Half Predicts Bullish Impulse To $2.8 The price action in both charts highlights a significant breakout from consolidation, with Bitcoin’s bullish momentum surging as November and December approach. Moreover, the Bollinger Bands for the Bitcoin CME charts are expanding similarly, indicating a potential for an upward trend continuation. Bollinger Bands are unique technical analysis tools for identifying sharp short-term price movements and potential entry and exit points. Looking at Severino’s Bitcoin CME chart for 2023 and 2024, the price is riding the upper Bollinger Band for both years, suggesting a strong bullish trend. Adding weight to the analysis of these parallel CME charts, the analyst has revealed that both charts showcase similar Fibonacci extensions. In 2023, the 4.416 and 6 Fibonacci extension levels served as crucial markers, with BTC rallying to reach their equivalent price levels at $39,265 and $45,250, respectively. These same Fib extension levels have also been highlighted on the 2024 Bitcoin CME chart, suggesting that Bitcoin could repeat history and hit new price targets of $105,465 and $124,125, respectively. Another key factor Severino identified on both Bitcoin CME charts is the presence of gaps. A CME futures gap refers to the differences between the closing and opening prices of BTC on the CME. In 2023, a CME gap was filled during Bitcoin’s price rally, with the 2024 chart also spotlighting a comparable gap near the $124,125 mark. $120,000 BTC Price Target In Sight While delving deep into the price action and key technical indicators of the Bitcoin CME charts of Nov/Dec 2023 and 2024, Severino predicted that Bitcoin could prepare for a bullish move above $120,000. The analyst has based this optimistic projection on the striking similarities between the Fibonacci extension levels of both Bitcoin CME charts. Related Reading: Weekly Bull Flag Appears On XRP Price Chart, Why A Double-Digit Is Still Feasible Earlier last week, the price of BTC experienced a sharp surge above $104,000, marking a new all-time high. However, the cryptocurrency quickly corrected to $94,000, with many analysts describing this decline as a “Bitcoin flash crash.” Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $97,638, experiencing a steady price increase from previous lows. If the cryptocurrency can maintain a stable bullish position, it’s possible that Bitcoin could rise back towards its $100,000 ATH.

Qubetics strengthens its ecosystem with a privacy-centric decentralized VPN (dVPN) and a compelling investment opportunity in its presale. Polkadot is on the verge of a major breakout as altcoin season gains momentum, while Kaspa shows bullish signals, targeting a 30% gain above key resistance levels. This article delves into these three blockchain projects and their potential impact on the market. Qubetics: Enhancing Web3 with dVPN and High ROI Potential Qubetics continues to redefine blockchain innovation with its integrated decentralized VPN (dVPN) , a key component of its growing ecosystem. The dVPN not only ensures secure and private connections but also strengthens the foundation for other decentralized services such as DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized storage. By safeguarding user activities and promoting Web3 principles of autonomy and decentralization, the dVPN enhances the overall value of the Qubetics platform. Currently in Presale Phase 12, Qubetics offers $TICS tokens at a price of $0.031. With over 305 million tokens sold, the presale has raised $5.5 million and attracted 8,400+ holders. Weekly phases bring 10% price hikes, culminating in a 20% increase in the final stage. The post-presale target price of $0.25 per token offers early adopters a 703.5% ROI potential. Long-term projections for $TICS tokens are even more enticing, with analysts forecasting values between $10 and $15 following the mainnet launch. These numbers translate to remarkable ROIs of 32,028.61% and 48,092.91%, respectively, making Qubetics a compelling opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on the future of decentralized technology. Polkadot: Poised for a Major Breakout Polkadot (DOT) has shown impressive growth over the past month, surging by 125% as it captures the attention of investors ahead of an anticipated altcoin season. Currently trading in the range of $8.66 to $11.90, Polkadot is testing resistance levels and exhibiting strong potential for further gains. The nearest resistance lies at $13.40, and technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Stochastic Oscillator suggest the token is in oversold territory, signaling a bullish reversal. If Polkadot breaks through this level, it could aim for the next target at $16.64, representing substantial gains from current prices. With the broader market preparing for a potential global crypto bull run, Polkadot’s strong fundamentals and scalable infrastructure position it as a key contender for substantial growth in the near term. Kaspa: Targeting a 30% Surge Kaspa (KAS) is making waves in the market with its consistent performance and bullish signals. Over the past month, Kaspa’s price has risen by 61%, trading in the range of $0.16 to $0.20 and sitting above the 100-day simple moving average of $0.17. The RSI at 44.86 indicates the token is not overbought, leaving room for further upward movement. The nearest resistance level for Kaspa is $0.22, and a breakout above this could pave the way for the next target at $0.26. This move would represent a potential 30% gain from current levels, supported by bullish momentum, including a 6.8% rise over the past week. As Kaspa continues to attract attention with its growth trajectory and positive technical indicators, it remains a project to watch in the ever-evolving blockchain market. A Blockchain Ecosystem Full of Opportunities Qubetics, Polkadot, and Kaspa exemplify the innovation and potential that drive the blockchain industry. Qubetics, widely regarded as the best crypto presale of the year, combines privacy-centric technology with a lucrative investment opportunity, reinforcing its position as a leader in decentralized services. Polkadot is on the brink of a major breakout, supported by strong market indicators and altcoin season momentum. Meanwhile, Kaspa targets substantial gains with its bullish signals and consistent upward trajectory. These projects showcase the diversity and transformative power of blockchain, offering exciting opportunities for investors and users alike. As they advance, they continue to redefine the possibilities within decentralized finance and digital ecosystems.

According to a Forbes report, the new Fortnite Ballistic mode competes with Call of Duty-type genres, n ot to mention players have also started calling it “CODnite” or “FortCOD” on X. FORTCOD 🔥👀 — 81 Real (@real_818) December 11, 2024 In this mode, players can join 5v5 first-person matches. It also comes with a Fortnite twist. If shot and dead, the characters turn into confetti cubes. This is most probably to retain the game’s Teen rating. Fortnite Ballistic mode is not only about the kills Like Counter-Strike players need to plant bombs while others try to stop him in this new mode. The rules are straightforward: There are no respawns in rounds and a round ends when a bomb detonates or when a team is wiped out. The teams switch sides after six rounds, and the first to win seven rounds wins the match. Players start off with the basic weapons and can buy upgrades to arm their gear as time goes on. Players get to keep the gear and shields if they survive a round. However, they’ll lose anything consumable. Items are sharable amongst teammates as in usual Fortnite mode. Including this, there are options for ranked and unranked modes as well. Fortnite is in the process of becoming a massive network of games At the moment, there’s only one map with a limited number of weapons and items. Given that it’s still an early test, Epic promises it will eventually add more maps and gear. It’s uncertain that FPS players from other games will give Fortnite a go in this mode. As it seems too simple at first, Epic needs to add more maps to the mode. Otherwise having only one map would quickly become boring. Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 1 continues, and the original Fortnite remains a part of the game permanently . The Epic Games’ flagship title is in the process of becoming a massive network of games.

Crypto King Musk (MUSKKING), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKKING is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Crypto King Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crypto King Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Crypto King Musk launched with over $7,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Crypto King Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Crypto King Musk by entering its contract address – v2jWiNpR1m8gHARdM39GosZ8muaxZpowpBgWgWTSCev – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

Here’s What You Need to Know appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Bitcoin price has acquired a 6-digit figure and achieved the $100K milestone, which was predicted well before the 2021 bull run. Meanwhile, most of the tokens within the top 10 cryptos, like ETH, XRP, ADA, & DOGE, are yet to mark a new ATH. Although Solana managed to mark new highs, it was hardly just a few dollars above the previous one. Therefore, the market participants believe that these tokens have more room to swell and hence the upper target for Solana is expected to be much above $500. SOL, the fifth largest token, has grown in popularity as a result of the increasing trading activity on the Solana chain. The rise in DEX volumes, spot trading volume, launch of new projects over the chain, etc. shed light on the bullish prospects. Currently, the SOL price is stuck within a descending parallel channel and has just triggered a rebound from the lower support. With an 8% jump, the SOL price is about to secure the levels above $230. Does this suggest the price could maintain a steep rise and mark a new ATH $300 before the end of 2024? The long-term price action of the SOL price suggests the token is primed for a bearish setback in the near future. The token smashed a new ATH but failed to clear the resistance zone between $251.54 and $265.09 and resulted in a pullback close to $200. Meanwhile, the bulls have jumped into resuque but the bears seem to have held a tight grip over the rally. Therefore, the token could be primed for an extended pullback, which may drag the levels below $200. The RSI displayed a bearish divergence before entering the overbought zone, while the MACD suggests a drop in the buying volume. Moreover, the levels could undergo a bearish crossover in a short while, validating a move towards the ascending support. Besides, the volume remains within a decent level, which is expected to keep up the volatility of the token. A popular asset management company, Bitwise, which deals with spot BTC & ETH ETFs, has predicted that along with Bitcoin, Ethereum, & Solana, they will form a new ATH. The highs for BTC are said to be around $200K, ETH at $7000, & SOL at $750. While the demand for a new ATH at $1000 is making a huge round, reaching $750 could be a fair play of the 2024 close will be bullish, marking a new ATH above $275.

Binance has bolstered its new bullish formation with a new token called MOVE, signaling as one of the top altcoins to watch. On the other hand, Sui network has been on a development journey due to a recent network outage. Meanwhile, Lunex Network (LNEX) keeps racking up gains as more investors flood its presale. Its impressive performance opens a possible path to a potential 100x price surge before the end of the ongoing bull market. Binance Token Leads Breakout Pattern With New MOVE Token Recently, Binance (BNB) token fell to a slumber after climbing above its monthly resistance level at $623.29. Despite climbing above a level it has hardly reached in the past few months, Binance was unable to maintain its price positivity as the token got stuck in a consolidation phase around this level. After consolidating for a few weeks, Binance finally launched its Movement Token (MOVE) to its network. This new Binance-based token aided more blockchain offerings from Binance network, further acting as a catalyst for price positivity and more interest from the DeFi market. At the moment, the native BNB token has successfully crossed over the $700 price mark. Furthermore, analysts like Crypto Zillion have hinted that the RSI (6) for Binance being at 79.19 indicates a strong bullish momentum for the BNB price. Sui (SUI) Gains Optimism as Recent Network Outage is Quickly Resolved Despite the recent network outage that happened on the Sui (SUI) network, experts are predicting bullish futures for the top altcoin. Notably, Sui recently broke out massively from a consolidation phase, entering into a weekly price range of $3.24 and $4.45, which reflects a 72% increase in the past month. However, analysts like cryptoELITES suggested that Sui is on track to hit $5.6, with the next target being $10. He further added that Sui will most likely hit the $10- $15 range by the end of January, with a long-term bullish price of $50 for the token. However, aside from several positive speculations for Sui, the network has also shown potential for growth. Another analyst, ToreroRomero sighted how Sui bested all other blockchains as it recorded the highest net inflows making it one of the top altcoins to watch. Lunex Network Accumulate Massive Gains Following Growing Interest in Its Presale Lunex Network (LNEX) has turned out to be a huge spectacle in the crypto market as its presale performance has shocked experts and investors with a whopping revenue exceeding nearly $5 million. The potential of this new DeFi project to simplify crypto transactions for retail, institutional and business investors while still ensuring smooth operability has been a huge contributing factor for its growth so far. What particularly stands Lunex Network apart is how it allows traders and investors seamlessly swap and transact over 50,000 crypto assets using a streamlined process. This makes it an attractive choice, especially because of its extremely low fees. In addition, Lunex Network offers a business merchant payment gateway for easy cryptocurrency acceptance and automatic fiat conversion, signaling it as a versatile platform with enhanced utility. As a result of its endless potential to revolutionize crypto transactions and also explore the lucrative side of the DeFi market to its limit, its native token has received massive buying interest. The native LNEX token has reportedly surged by over 217% to its current price of $0.0038. However, its token growth potential is not its only profitable feature. Its revenue share model and cashback rewards has also bolstered investor confidence in this token’s ability to skyrocket. Can LNEX Deliver More Gains Than BNB and SUI This Bull Cycle? Lunex Network’s native token, LNEX, is only priced for $0.0038 now. However, with an 100x growth already projected for the token, now serves as the best time to take advantage of its growth potential. While BNB and Sui network also pose as potentially high gainers in 2025, LNEX may be a better investment option, especially for risk-averse investors.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics announced Wednesday that CPI had risen 0.3% in November, up 2.7% year-on-year, in line with forecasts.

According to the SEC , the individuals used fake websites , social media, and voice-altering software to impersonate legitimate financial professionals, targeting at least 28 victims. The defendants — Chibuzo Augustine Onyeachonam, Stanley Chidubem Asiegbu, and Chukwuebuka Martin Nweke-Eze — allegedly posed as brokers and advisers from well-known U.S. firms. They created websites mimicking real professionals, complete with fake testimonials from supposed clients. They used social media and group chats to lure investors into trusting them. Victims were asked to buy Bitcoin ( BTC ) through legitimate exchanges and then transfer the funds to the fraudsters’ blockchain wallets.

37515458,https://crypto.news/?p=14318407,1733943850,Marinade Finance offers new governance proposal to tackle oversized role of MEV,"Solana DeFi platform Marinade Finance has offered a series of governance proposals aimed at tackling unchecked MEV to ensure decentralization and safety in the ecosystem. Marinade Finance posted its governance proposal titled “Tackling Malicious Validators and Democratizing MEV on Solana” on the Marinade community forum on Dec. 11. The Solana ( SOL ) -based non-custodial liquid staking protocol asked for feedback from its community regarding its set of proposals aimed at managing MEV. MEV, which stands for Maximal Extractable Value, is described as the value that is extracted from transaction sequencing. Marinade views MEV as “both a challenge and an opportunity.” This is because MEV has the potential to enhance the network’s efficiency through optimizing liquidity, improving price discovery, and rewarding validators. However, when unchecked, MEV can also make the ecosystem vulnerable to sandwich attacks, front-running, and risk centralization. In an email to crypto.news, CEO of Marinade Finance Michael Repetný emphasized the importance of maintaining decentralization, transparency, and innovation in the blockchain. Therefore, he believes that addressing the challenges posed by malicious validators and MEV is crucial for the health and sustainability of the Solana ecosystem. “At Marinade Labs, we recognize that while MEV cannot be eliminated, its impact can be managed, and its value can be distributed fairly,” said Repetný. You might also like: Zodia Custody taps Marinade Finance to offer Solana staking services Repetný explained that at a recent stake auction marketplace held by Marinade, validators were able to set bids that were way higher than the reasonable standard when it came to rewards on Solana because the system was open and transparent. Without proper data, he said the team was unable to separate the legitimate validators from the ones participating in malicious MEV activities. “Some external research confirmed our observations, explaining that the value of negative MEV externalities has not only been growing but also started to centralize instead of being distributed among many actors.” Repetný. In the forum post, Marinade Labs explained that MEV can be tackled with strategies that prioritize reducing harmful MEV and redistributing the inevitable MEV through open markets. The first involves forming a public committee in charge of monitoring validators. The committee will work on identifying malicious validators that are proven to have harmful actions. After identifying which validators are bad actors, the committee will cut their PSR bond. This action is done to discourage future malicious activity from other validators and protect the network. The second proposal is reopening the public mempool in order to decentralize access to MEV. The staking protocol argued that the distribution of MEV opportunities in public mempools is much fairer compared to private mempools that risk centralizing the deal flow. The third and final proposal involves allocating treasury funds from Marinade DAO or MNDE DAO for research on Solana MEVs. The research initiatives are aimed at analyzing MEV trends, risks, and opportunities, exploring strategies to mitigate harmful MEVs, and developing tools to make MEV more transparent and inclusive. The research findings will be used to guide future governance decisions and create improvements for the Solana ecosystem. Repetný stated research on MEV should be the first priority for the Solana ecosystem as it will help developers to identify the problem and mitigate MEV. “Funding the MEV research to get better visibility into the problem, such as what platforms suffer the most from negative MEV, quantifying the problem, and putting together existing research pieces like “A sandwich-resistant AMM” into an actionable list on how to mitigate the negative externalities of MEV.” Repetný You might also like: MNDE token up 170% as Marinade staking pool reaches 10m SOL",POSITIVE,SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | SOL | RESEARCH,,0,0,crypto.news,https://crypto.news/marinade-finance-offers-new-governance-proposal-to-tackle-oversized-role-of-mev/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/37515458.jpeg

This sentiment reflects the growing recognition of these digital assets as transformative investments. XRP is Pioneering Cross-Border Payment Solutions XRP, the native cryptocurrency of the XRP Ledger (XRPL) was designed to revolutionize cross-border payments. Ripple, the company behind XRP, has forged partnerships with financial institutions worldwide, positioning XRP as a bridge currency for international transactions. This innovation enables near-instant settlements at a fraction of the cost associated with traditional systems like SWIFT. Many experts see XRP as a viable alternative to SWIFT, and this could become a reality, as rumors suggest that the BRICS bloc is seeking a crypto-based alternative to SWIFT. XRP’s utility has only grown with its integration into initiatives such as central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and on-demand liquidity (ODL) solutions. This growing adoption has further solidified its position in the market, boosting investor confidence and setting the stage for broader adoption. XLM and XDC Prominence in the Crypto World While XRP garners significant attention, XLM and XDC are noteworthy for their specialized use cases. XLM operates on the Stellar network, bridging gaps between traditional financial systems and blockchain technology. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 By enabling fast and affordable payments, XLM has gained traction in promoting financial inclusion, especially in underserved regions . Its open-source nature and commitment to decentralization have made it a favorite among developers and institutions. XDC is the native token of the XinFin hybrid blockchain, specializing in trade finance. XinFin addresses inefficiencies in this multi-trillion-dollar sector by digitizing and streamlining processes, making trade finance more accessible and cost-effective. XDC’s targeted application in a high-value industry shows its long-term growth potential. Why These Cryptocurrencies Stand Out XRP, XLM, and XDC are united by their ability to address real-world financial challenges through innovative blockchain solutions. Their utility, scalability, and cost-effective designs position them as key players in the global shift toward digital finance. DigitalG’s assertion highlights the growing consensus among experts that these assets represent unparalleled opportunities for investors seeking to align with transformative technology. While XRP is particularly dominant in cross-border payments , XLM and XDC offer complementary strengths, broadening the scope for long-term growth.

37515731,https://blockworks.co/news/extended-hybrid-derivatives-exchange,1733943600,A Binance-like experience with decentralized settlement,"Extended, formerly X10, is ramping up its hybrid derivatives exchange to provide open access to all users today. An invite-only launch saw $300 million in trading volume, according to the team . Key to its offering will be unified portfolio margining, which enables users to trade both spot and perpetuals with a single collateral pool, thus enhancing capital efficiency for traders. While commonplace in traditional finance, unified margining is still rare in DeFi. Extended further boasts ultra-low latency (10-20ms), comparable to centralized exchanges, achieved through centralized order processing with trustless onchain settlement. This system is supported by StarkWare’s StarkEx technology, the same platform dYdX v3 employed prior to launching its own chain. Read more: dYdX tokenomics scrutinized as staking goes live The trust-minimized architecture includes permissionless withdrawals, and Extended has plans to migrate to Starknet, according to CEO Ruslan Fakhrutdinov. “Based on our reviews and assessments, [ StarkWare is] at least years ahead of anyone else, technologically,” Fakhrutdinov, the former head of crypto operations at Revolut, told Blockworks. “For us, blockchain is just a settlement layer,” Fakhrutdinov said, emphasizing the platform’s chain-agnostic approach. “As long as it has the infrastructure for trustless settlement, we can always settle and migrate if necessary,” he said. One novel feature of Extended is that user collateral is fully segregated and never comingled, even within its planned liquidity vaults launching in early 2025. Funds are held in individual sub-accounts tied directly to their contributions, with onchain settlements reflecting this separation. Unlike other platforms that offer vaults, such as Hyperliquid, which pool funds under a central manager, Extended’s approach mitigates legal risks and maintains transparency. The vaults are nevertheless treated as a single user for efficiency during centralized processing, and splits transactions during settlement. Fakhrutdinov credits “asynchronous, parallelized settlement,” as the key to achieving such low latency, “on par with any centralized exchange. Extended has no token, but raised $6.5 million earlier this year and plans to launch a points program soon.

The asset class as a whole added $10 billion market value in only two weeks since it surpassed the 2022 bull cycle record of $190 billion, according to CCData and DefiLlama.  Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to hold a steady price, predominantly pegged to the U.S. dollar. They are a key piece of infrastructure for the digital assets space, serving as the main source of liquidity for trading crypto assets on exchanges and move value on blockchain rails.  Demand for stablecoins grew steadily through the past year as crypto markets emerged from a brutal bear market. The growth significantly accelerated following Donald Trump's election victory last month, adding $30 billion supply as investors poured funds into cryptocurrencies in a frenzy.  Tether's USDT, the most popular stablecoin, climbed to a record supply of $139 billion, up 12% in a month, DefiLlama data shows. USDT was recognized as an accepted virtual asset by the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) earlier this week, and the issuer aims to expand services across the Middle East region.  Circle's USDC, the second-largest in the asset class, also grew 9% to nearly $41 billion market value during the same period. Circle just recently teamed up with Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange by trading volume, to push USDC adoption globally.  It's not just the booming crypto market that drives growth, though.  There's evidence for increasing stablecoin usage for payments, remittances and savings, especially in developing countries with rapidly depreciating local currency and fragile financial systems. One indication of stablecoin adoption for non-crypto use cases is the rapidly growing number of stablecoin transactions on transfer applications including peer-to-peer payment platforms, Nik Milanovic, partner at the venture capital firm Fintech Fund, pointed out in an X post.  Tokenized products with stable prices that offer yield to investors are also in vogue. Ethena's dollar-pegged USDe token, which generates yield by shorting bitcoin and ether perpetuals farming the funding rate, surged over $5 billion, up 90% in a month, per DefiLlama data. Up-and-coming decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Usual's stablecoin zoomed to $700 million, doubling in size during the same period.  Market cap could double in 2025  The growth will likely continue into the next year, with digital asset manager Bitwise predicting the stablecoin market as reaching $400 billion in 2025. According to a Tuesday report, one of the key catalysts could be the U.S. Congress passing long-awaited stablecoin legislation that defines rules for businesses and institutions to issue and interact with tokens.  ""Clear answers to big questions—Who regulates them? What are the proper reserve requirements?— will spark massive new interest among issuers, consumers, and businesses,"" Bitwise analysts wrote. ""When that happens, expect some large traditional banks like J.P. Morgan and others to enter the space.""  Other growth catalysts include popular fintech applications integrating stablecoins to their services following Paypal's example with its PYUSD stablecoin, and the increasing role of stablecoins in global payments and remittances, the report added.  It's not just Bitwise who came out with bullish projections for stablecoins. Standard Chartered and Zodia Markets forecasted in a report last month that stablecoins could reach to the equivalent of 10% of U.S. money supply and foreign exchange transactions, up from the current 1%.",POSITIVE,USDT,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | USDT,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/11/stablecoin-market-cap-hits-200-b-milestone-could-double-in-2025-as-adoption-accelerates,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d422e9baad43a76ae3ee4018330ca23134bbcded-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
37515480,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=626098,1733943325,"US inflation climbs to 2.7%, putting the Federal Reserve in a bind","Inflation in the United States accelerated in November, with consumer prices rising 2.7% over the past year. Monthly, the consumer price index (CPI) increased by 0.3%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, held steady at 3.3% annually and 0.3% monthly. These figures came in line with expectations. Markets are bracing for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on December 18. Traders overwhelmingly predict a 25-basis-point rate cut, raising odds to 99%, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool. But, the Federal Reserve remains stuck between inflation that won’t quit and the risks of over-cutting rates. The odds for an additional cut in January crept up to 23%. Shelter costs dominate CPI increases Housing costs once again drove inflation higher in November. The shelter index, which accounts for about one-third of the CPI calculation, rose 0.3% for the month and 4.7% annually. The BLS reported that this component alone made up 40% of the total monthly CPI increase. Within shelter, rents saw modest gains of 0.2%, with the smallest monthly increases in over two years. Owner-equivalent rent, which estimates what homeowners would pay to rent their own properties, also edged up by 0.2%. Despite slight moderation, shelter inflation remains stubbornly high, with Fed officials pinning hopes on lease renegotiations to ease price pressures. However, the monthly uptick in rents has been relentless, fueling concerns that housing-related inflation may outlast other categories. Vehicle prices flipped the script in November, reversing months of declines. Used vehicle prices jumped 2%, while new vehicle prices climbed 0.6%. These gains disrupted expectations for easing inflation in the goods sector and underscored potential stickiness in core inflation categories. Economists warn that rising car prices could stall progress on overall disinflation. Food prices rose 0.4% for the month and 2.4% annually. Notably, cereal and bakery products recorded a historic monthly decline of 1.1%, the sharpest drop since the measure began in 1989. Fed weighs rate cuts amid persistent inflation The Federal Reserve finds itself in a tight corner. While inflation is well below the 40-year high reached in mid-2022, it remains above the central bank’s 2% target. Officials have already trimmed the federal funds rate by a full percentage point since September. A December rate cut would be the Fed’s fourth reduction in as many months, using aggressive action to balance inflation control with economic stability. Investors are already speculating about what 2025 might hold. But, analysts are cautioning against overestimating the Fed’s room for easing, pointing out that inflation has remained “sticky” in key categories like shelter and services. As the Fed debates its next steps, political and economic pressures are mounting. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen shared concerns about the potential impact of tariffs proposed by President-elect Donald Trump, warning that they could derail progress on inflation. She said , “Tariffs could significantly raise costs to households and hurt competitiveness.” Wall Street, meanwhile, is keeping a close eye on Fed policy. Stock futures rose slightly after the inflation data was released, as markets interpreted the numbers as supportive of another rate cut.

Conventional wisdom among crypto natives is that you shouldn’t think too hard about it — after all, coins named after dogs, frogs or cats will regularly outperform tokens tied to legitimate projects.  But that state of affairs cannot last forever, according to Cosmo Jiang, a general partner and portfolio manager at crypto hedge fund and venture capital firm Pantera Capital.  “If fundamental investing does not come to this industry, it just means that we failed,” Jiang, a self-described classically trained investor who worked in banking and private equity before joining crypto in 2022, told CoinDesk in an interview. “All assets eventually follow the laws of gravity. The only thing that matters to investors at the end of the day — and this has been true for millennia — is cash flow.”  “Crypto went from nothing to $3.4 trillion in market cap now on the back of retail interest,” Jiang said, “but the only way for this asset class to keep growing is by attracting institutional capital. And institutional capital will only care about fundamentals. Logically, that will be the only way to make money on a sustainable basis going forward.”  Pantera has roughly $5 billion in assets under management, Jiang said, with about 75% of those funds locked in venture vehicles and the rest in liquid assets. As the portfolio manager of the firm’s liquid token fund, Jiang’s focus lies in publicly traded tokens.  How does he pick which ones to add to the fund’s portfolio? By looking at product-market fit — meaning, at crypto projects that are developing products in areas where there’s huge demand. There are wwo basic questions at the forefront of his mind: whether the team can execute on their vision, and whether there’s a chance their token will capture some of the economic surplus generated.  “This will sound so stupid to anyone that works with normal asset classes, because it’s so normal,” Jiang said. “But in crypto, for whatever reason, this method is non-consensus.”  Solana versus Ethereum  When it comes to crypto projects, layer-1 networks offer some of the most battle-hardened business models. Smart contract platforms are relatively old — Ethereum launched in 2015 — and generate revenue through transaction fees. Their tokens also accrue value when their networks see increased usage. Solana’s SOL and Telegram’s TON have been two of Jiang’s favorites. But Ethereum’s ether (ETH), to him, isn’t as attractive of an investment as it used to be, because new users aren’t flocking to the network.  Solana saw almost 3 million in average daily active addresses in the last six months, according to a Dune dashboard by altcoin_analyst, while Ethereum only saw 454,000. Moreover, Solana has increased its revenue by 180% in the last 30 days, compared to Ethereum’s 37%, per TokenTerminal. And that means the difference in annualized revenue is shrinking: Solana made $1.27 billion in the last 12 months and is quickly catching up to Ethereum’s $2.4 billion. Despite that, Solana’s market capitalization is still four times lower than Ethereum’s.  “Take a look at incremental growth and compare how much has gone to Solana versus Ethereum. The numbers are stark,” Jiang said. “None of this stuff is worth anything if no one uses it.”  “Ethereum clearly has a lot of very talented people building on it. It has an interesting roadmap, but it's also valued for that, right?” Jiang added. “It is a very large asset. At $435 billion, that would rank it amongst one of the most successful companies in the world if it were compared to equity. And the unfortunate fact is it's currently losing market share [to Solana and others].”  Another big difference between the two networks lies in their architecture. In its attempt to solve scaling issues, Ethereum has switched to a so-called modular blockchain design, meaning that various network tasks are split between Ethereum and its associated layer 2s like Arbitrum or Optimism. Solana, meanwhile, has kept it monolithic — everything happens on one blockchain.  For Jiang, that means Solana has an advantage in terms of user interface, and also in terms of capturing the network’s value through SOL. Ethereum, meanwhile, ends up splitting its value across an array of tokens and blockchains, which means the network needs to facilitate a lot more transactions for ETH to outmatch SOL. However, Ethereum’s throughput is rapidly increasing, so in theory the network could develop enough activity for that to eventually happen, but it’s not a guarantee.  “The driving force behind Ethereum philosophy has been maximum decentralization,” Jiang said. “I'm not a crypto native, I'm really a tech investor, so I don't believe in decentralization for the sake of decentralization. There's probably a minimum viable decentralization that's good enough.”  We’re still early  Jiang’s attention isn’t confined to layer 1s, however. DePIN — an umbrella term for projects focused on building physical infrastructure with the help of blockchain technology — is another source of interest for him and his team. DePIN (short for ""Decentralized physical infrastructure network"") projects include Render Network (RNDR), which enables people to lease unused computing power, and Arweave (AR), which functions as a data storage network.  “When I’m talking to [liquidity providers] ... the only stuff that gets them interested is DePIN, because these are real businesses in the real world, it's something that people can actually allocate and get behind,” Jiang said.  But he’s not against investing in memecoins too — or, at least, in the projects that enable memecoin trading, if not the coins themselves. “I would never, as a hedge fund investor, invest in a blackjack player,” he said. “But I've made a lot of money investing in casinos.” And there’s reason to believe the sector could keep expanding, because at the end of the day, the revenue generated by Pump.fun, trading bots and decentralized exchanges is still small compared to the revenue generated by the $540 billion global gambling market.  Even so, Jiang’s strategy failed to outperform bitcoin's (BTC) 132% return in 2024, he said. In his view, that’s due to bitcoin being relatively advanced in its own bullish cycle, whereas blockchain technology has lagged behind throughout the year. That being said, prospective returns on such tokens should ultimately be higher than for bitcoin, he said, especially since the incoming Trump administration will likely be much friendlier towards the industry than the Biden one ever was.  “On a compounded multi-year basis, we will do extremely well,” Jiang said. “If blockchain reaches billions of users over time, then almost logically, you have to believe that everything else will grow a lot faster than bitcoin.”",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH | SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | SOL,Tom Carreras,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/11/crypto-doesn-t-care-about-cash-flow-that-will-soon-change-says-pantera-capital,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3bb8a55f364ebb634fafdef3141b3fab6a5601a0-4160x3328.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
37514909,https://crypto.news/?p=14318528,1733942772,Alabama State Auditor pitches Bitcoin reserve,"Andrew Sorrell, Alabama State Auditor General, joined a growing cast of figures calling for strategic Bitcoin reserves in the U.S. The Alabama State Auditor suggested creating a Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve as federal and state legislators flocked toward the idea after Donald Trump’s Nov. 6 victory. “The debate over whether crypto will succeed has ended,” Sorrell said, speaking to 1819 News about the reasons for his supporting BTC. Sorrell asserted that establishing a strategic BTC reserve would help Alabama, and other U.S. states, diversify government portfolios, hedge against fiat-related risks and inflation, and position jurisdictions as crypto-friendly business areas. The Alabama Auditor General advised caution, proposing that the state follow a federal bill presented by Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis and adopt a dollar-cost average plan. DCA-ing involves buying predetermined amounts of an asset over a given period. Sorrell suggested that Alabama accumulates its reserve over two years. The framework the state should follow would be to dollar-cost-average our way in over 2 years. Bitcoin just crossed over $100,000 recently, so buying into a bull market may not be the best timing. A better strategy is monthly purchases over a 2-year period that average out your entry price. Andrew Sorrell, Alabama State Auditor General You might also like: Meme coins FWOG, GOAT, and SPX debut on Kraken Sorrell’s proposal mirrored increasing State-backed demand for a BTC reserve, an idea catapulted by promises from President-elect Donald Trump and his incoming administration. Trump has tapped industry leaders like Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong for advice, picked Silicon Valley veteran David Sacks as the first crypto czar, and nominated pro-crypto former federal regulator Paul Atkins as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Senator Lummis moved to improve on Trump’s pledge to retain America’s 207,000 BTC stockpile, about 1% of Bitcoin’s supply. The Senator’s BITCOIN bill would accumulate 4% of BTC’s 21 million fixed supply over five years, if approved by the Senate.

The cryptocurrency market remains in flux, with investor sentiment split between optimism driven by institutional interest and concerns over ongoing economic uncertainties. Institutional players like MARA Holdings (NASDAQ: MARA ) and Riot Platforms have increased their Bitcoin exposure, showing confidence in the asset’s long-term potential. However, skepticism persists, highlighted by Microsoft’s (NASDAQ: MSFT ) shareholders rejecting a proposal to add Bitcoin to the company’s balance sheet, reflecting lingering hesitancy among traditional corporate players. BTC seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold The mixed signals have sparked speculation across the market, leaving investors questioning where Bitcoin, the world’s leading cryptocurrency, will stand as 2024 draws to a close. Institutional demand strengthens optimism One of the week’s most significant developments came from MARA Digital Holdings, which purchased 11,774 BTC for approximately $1.1 billion at an average price of $96,000. This acquisition, completed following a zero-coupon convertible note offering, brings MARA’s total holdings to 40,435 BTC, currently valued at $3.92 billion. Riot Platforms has similarly expanded its reserves, further signaling institutional confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Adding to the positive sentiment, billionaire investor Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, endorsed Bitcoin as a hedge against what he described as a looming “debt money problem.” Dalio’s backing of hard assets like Bitcoin and gold underscores the growing recognition of Bitcoin’s role in the global financial landscape. Inflation data shapes market sentiment The latest US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report revealed that inflation edged up to 2.7% in November from 2.6% in October, meeting market expectations. The Core CPI held steady at 3.3% year-over-year and 0.3% month-over-month, mirroring the prior month. This data has intensified speculation of a 25-basis-point rate cut at next week’s Federal Reserve meeting, with the CME FedWatch Tool placing the probability at 97%. Historically, lower interest rates provide a favorable environment for risk assets, which could offer a tailwind for Bitcoin’s price in the weeks ahead. Meanwhile, institutional demand continues to surge, exemplified by BlackRock’s (NYSE: BLK ) iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). On Monday, IBIT reported inflows exceeding $394 million, according to data from Farside Investors , showing growing institutional interest in Bitcoin as an investment vehicle. Historical context: December’s mixed record December has been a historically unpredictable month for Bitcoin, with an average return of 5%, though six out of the past 11 Decembers have posted negative results. However, bull markets have delivered standout performances, such as a 46.92% gain in 2020 and a 38.89% rise in 2017. Conversely, the volatility of year-end trading is evident in years like 2013, when Bitcoin dropped 34.81% in December despite a massive 449.35% rally in November, as reported by Finbold. ChatGPT’s Bitcoin price prediction Based on historical trends and current market dynamics, ChatGPT envisions two potential scenarios for Bitcoin’s price by December 31, 2024. In a bullish scenario, AI predicts that Bitcoin could rise to $105,000, fueled by sustained institutional inflows, easing monetary policies, and a stable macroeconomic environment. ChatGPT outlook on Bitcoin’s year-end performance. Source: ChatGPT/Finbold Conversely, in a bearish scenario, Bitcoin may consolidate around $94,000, reflecting cautious investor sentiment and potential market headwinds. That being said, the market is closely monitoring the upcoming US Producer Price Index (PPI) data, which will shed light on inflationary trends and inform the Federal Reserve’s rate-cut trajectory. Combined with ongoing institutional activity, these factors are poised to shape Bitcoin’s performance in the final weeks of the year.

Opening at a listing price of $0.01397, the PEPU price initially dipped to $0.0089, as is typical of most high-profile presale launches. However, the meme coin soon skyrocketed to an all-time high of $0.02646 with over a $205 million fully diluted valuation, representing a 200% growth. The successful launch has only reinforced the bullish outlook of smart money investors who are eyeing up to 10x returns from it. In fact, a few prominent investors are calling it one of the best meme coins to buy now. Two words: ROARING SUCCESS!That's the only way to describe Pepe Unchained's first day. And we want to congratulate our insane community, while sharing some highlights from the first 24 hours.🔥Pepe Unchained L2 LAUNCHED flawlessly🔥Trending NUMBER 1 On @dexscreener … pic.twitter.com/mMZT2L0zl1 — Pepe Unchained (@pepe_unchained) December 11, 2024 Pepe Unchained Meme Coin Trends Online PEPU has quickly become one of the top trending meme coins within 48 hours of its DEX launch. As of press time, it is already the 10th most trending cryptocurrency on DexScreener . It is also the 4th most trending crypto on CoinMarketCap globally, ahead of Bitcoin and XRP. At one point, it was the top trending coin on both the aforementioned platforms. With locked liquidity and high trading volume, experts believe PEPU is poised to be one of the best-performing meme coins in the coming months. Pepe Unchained recently completed what was the one of the most successful presale performances of 2024. The meme coin raised over $73.5 million in its Initial Coin Offering, thanks to the Pepe The Frog packaging and its high utility nature. In particular, Pepe Unchained’s Layer-2 ecosystem, designed specifically for meme coin trading, has caught the attention of whales and retailers alike. The promise of instant transactions, extremely low trading fees and cutting-edge tools, that too on Ethereum, is too good to pass on. Simply put, Pepe Unchained is offering Solana’s advantages while also benefitting from Ethereum’s vast user base. Its cutting-edge tools, including a block explorer , the ETH-PEPU bridge , custom DEX and DEX analytics are already live. It is rare for new meme coins to offer even a fraction of PEPU’s utility. After all, it is not without any reason why the meme coin saw such heavy bidding during its presale. $50k buys were daily occurrences for Pepe Unchained and many whales even purchased over $200k worth of PEPU in its presale. These deep-pocketed and savvy investors clearly believe that Pepe Unchained is one of the best meme coins to buy. PEPU Price Prediction - Best Meme Coin To Buy? The Pepe Unchained price appears poised for a new all-time high in the coming hours. Its price action is following a clear uptrend, successfully retesting its upwards trendline on multiple occasions. If the trend continues, PEPU could potentially surge to a $300 - $500 million market capitalization in the coming days. As such, the meme coin still has a plethora of bullish narratives to rally on. For instance, it is still not live on any centralized exchange, which is substantially limiting its upside potential. Considering the hype surrounding the project and its strong presale performance, PEPU is set to launch on Tier-1 CEXs soon and is even drawing Binance rumours. Moreover, its most-hyped feature - Pepe’s Pump Pad - is still in the works. The meme coin launchpad is being viewed as a competitor to Pump Fun. While Pump Fun has launched several billion-dollar meme coins for SOL holders, Ethereum’s vast user base has been devoid of such explosive returns. That is, until now. With PEPU at the core of the ecosystem, it is also expected to skyrocket following Pepe’s Pump Pad’s launch. Some experts are viewing PEPU as one of the best meme coins to buy now. Considering it has a market capitalization of just over $200 million, prominent investors are still eyeing up to 10x returns from it, expecting it to be the next billion-dollar meme coin.

According to Lee, there are two key factors supporting higher growth next year: the Fed’s easing as inflation falls and the incoming Trump administration’s pro-business policies. While the Fed is expected to focus more on employment as inflation is brought under control, potential policy changes from the new administration could boost corporate earnings growth, Lee explained. Lee, a longtime Bitcoin bull, predicts the largest cryptocurrency could rally to $250,000 by 2025. Bitcoin surpassed $100,000 for the first time last week, demonstrating the strength of its current rally. According to Lee, Bitcoin’s historical post-halving price cycles, combined with increasing institutional adoption and positive political sentiment, make such gains “extremely likely.” Related News: Citi Analysts Speak About “Bitcoin Will Replace the Dollar” Claim Lee also noted the potential impact of U.S. government intervention. He noted that if the U.S. were to accumulate Bitcoin as part of its strategic reserves, it would give BTC more legitimacy and push prices even higher. “Bitcoin’s growth is part of a broader trend toward increasing institutional adoption that will drive the entire market forward,” Lee said. Beyond Bitcoin, he also expects other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche to see significant gains. *This is not investment advice.

AI agents are also increasing their own social media mindshare, competing with legitimate projects offering real infrastructure. They have a total market capitalization above $9B based on their tokens, even surpassing older assets that pivoted into the AI narrative. The space is extremely competitive, with mindshare growing or waning based on short-term popularity. The AI agent space also expanded its value by more than 13% in the past week, tracking the performance of other types of AI startups. AI agents are also creating an industry around themselves, such as launch and data platforms, as well as infrastructure to deploy AI agents. As of December 2024, there were 335 tracked AI agents with notable social media mindshare. While just a couple of months ago AI agents were limited to a handful of X accounts, currently AI agent creation is going through a boom similar to meme tokens.

Pepe MAGA (PEPEMAGA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe MAGA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe MAGA by entering its contract address – C3zan7DDUAxZDSLnSxpptmyARsvGAbah4KWQB5QokoFM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

37514376,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=374238,1733941748,Raydium Surpasses Uniswap to Claim Top Spot in Monthly DEX Volume: Messari,"In October, Raydium made history by becoming the number one DEX by volume across all chains, a milestone it quickly built on in November. According to Messari’s latest report, Raydium surged ahead of Uniswap in monthly DEX volumes by a striking 30%, achieving $124.6 billion compared to Uniswap’s $90.5 billion. Raydium Leaves Uniswap Behind Raydium has steadily increased its share of Solana’s DEX volume this year. Since March 6, Raydium has consistently outperformed Orca, its closest competitor, in daily volumes. The third quarter of 2024 was a key milestone for Raydium, as it took the lead in daily DEX volume for the first time since 2022, marking its second consecutive quarter at the top. By November 2024, Raydium was capturing over 60% of Solana’s daily DEX volume, as per Messari’s analysis. The explosive growth in meme coin trading has become a key driver of Raydium’s volume, particularly after the US presidential election on November 5, 2024. In the subsequent weeks, daily meme coin trading on Raydium averaged nearly $2 billion – three times higher than the previous month’s average. This surge in meme coin activity now accounts for 65% of Raydium’s total daily trading volume, a significant increase from just 2% in November 2023. The synergy between Raydium and Pump.fun , the popular Solana-based meme coin launchpad, has played a crucial role. As Pump.fun tokens reach a market cap of $69,000, Raydium’s automated market maker (AMM) pools receive additional liquidity, providing ongoing trading opportunities and driving further volume. Raydium Boosted by Solana’s Growing Market Share Raydium’s surge in volume and success is intrinsically linked to the rapid expansion of the Solana ecosystem, which has emerged as a significant competitor to Ethereum in the DEX space. Following a series of impactful airdrops in December 2023, Solana quickly began challenging Ethereum’s dominance in weekly DEX volumes. Messari’s report noted that the liquidity influx resulting from these airdrops dramatically increased Solana’s network activity. In Q3 2024, Solana’s share of weekly DEX volume exceeded Ethereum’s threefold, marking a turning point in the decentralized exchange hierarchy. This momentum continued through October 2024, with Solana consistently overtaking Ethereum in daily DEX volume. By November 2024, Solana had captured nearly 50% of monthly DEX volume, 175% more than Ethereum’s 18%. The migration of users to Solana has led to increased volumes for platforms like Raydium.

Recently, a whale transaction tracker, Whale Alert made a post on X (previously Twitter) that 22.08 million XRP tokens worth $46.13 million were transferred from Binance to an unknown wallet. Whale Buy the Dip Adds $46.13 Million XRP This substantial XRP transaction occurred during a period when the overall cryptocurrency market was struggling to gain momentum and had been bleeding significantly. However, this transfer of XRP hints at “buy the dip” activity. However, yesterday, December 10, 2024, the market downturn caused XRP along with other cryptocurrencies, to bleed significantly. Despite this, whales and long-term holders remained controlled, as they did not move their XRP holdings from their wallets to exchanges for a sell-off, according to the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass. $140 Million of XRP Outflow from Exchanges Data from XRP spot inflow/outflow revealed that exchanges have witnessed a substantial $139.5 million worth of asset outflow in the past three days, while yesterday’s price decline caused a modest inflow of $11 million. This data indicates that long-term holders remain focused on accumulation despite the price decline. Source: Coinglass In the cryptocurrency industry, outflow refers to the movement of assets from exchanges to wallets, which is considered a bullish sign as it hints at a potential upside rally and a perfect buying opportunity. XRP Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels Besides the rising interest from whales, XRP’s daily chart appears to be forming a bullish flag and pole price action pattern, hinting at significant upside momentum in the coming days. However, XRP has held itself above the strong support level of $2, which keeps the altcoin bullish, but it is currently facing minor resistance near $2.45.

Current Price Momentum At press time, XRP is trading near the $2.40 level and has witnessed a price surge of over 20% in the past 24 hours.

EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto), a prominent market analyst, has thrown his hat in the race with an intriguing scenario for XRP that mirrors a significant historical market event. In his analysis, EGRAG CRYPTO drew parallels between XRP and Tesla, Elon Musk’s revolutionary electric vehicle company.

Shortly after, #TSLA stock dumped nearly 50% It took 6 months to find a bottom… pic.twitter.com/hVvjaevuIx — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 9, 2024 Historical Context and Comparative Analysis In December 2018, Tesla underwent a challenging period and faced significant market volatility. During a 60 Minutes interview , Tesla CEO Elon Musk discussed the company’s difficulties, particularly surrounding the deployment of the Tesla Model 3. Immediately following this interview, Tesla’s stock experienced a notable decline. The stock price dropped from $25.16 on December 13, 2018, to approximately $11.80 by June 2019 – representing a substantial 50% reduction. However, the subsequent market recovery was remarkable. Within six months of reaching the lowest point, Tesla’s stock had recovered to its previous levels, and over the next two years, it experienced an extraordinary appreciation of almost 3,500%. XRP’s Current Market Position A similar narrative is emerging around XRP. Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse appeared on 60 Minutes on December 8 to discuss the ongoing lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the role of cryptocurrencies in the current political landscape, and the regulatory environment in the U.S. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Coincidentally, XRP experienced a price decline following the interview. The interview was clearly meant to demean the crypto industry contrary to what was anticipated. This led to a massive crash in the market. This decline sent XRP to $1.93, the first time it has dropped below $2 since it breached this level in early December. While the price has partially recovered to around $2.07, EGRAG CRYPTO’s analysis suggests this might be part of a price market correction. Potential Future Trajectory The analysis suggests XRP could experience a 50% price correction to trade at approximately $1.30. While such a decline might seem concerning, EGRAG CRYPTO sees this as a precursor to significant future growth. If XRP follows a similar trajectory to Tesla, it could rise 3,500% to $46.8. This target is close to the $48 target set by another well-respected analyst and has given investors a reason to hold on despite the recent volatility.

Shiba Inu: An Ethereum-based memecoin with growing utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency inspired by Dogecoin but built on the Ethereum blockchain. Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous creator named Ryoshi, it began with a quadrillion tokens. Half of these were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who donated a significant portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply. SHIB’s integration with Ethereum allows for applications like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange. Plans are underway for a future NFT platform and a governance system based on a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Given its expanding utility and projects in development, SHIB remains a topic of interest in the current market. BONK: Solana’s community-driven meme coin with Shiba Inu mascot BONK is a meme coin on the Solana blockchain, featuring a Shiba Inu mascot. It aims to empower the Solana community by redistributing power from venture capital tokens. After a Coinbase listing, BONK surged over 100%. It serves as a “community coin,” with 50% of its supply airdropped to Solana’s NFT and DeFi participants. As of mid-December 2023, BONK was the third-largest meme coin by market cap and one of the top gainers, with a year-to-date increase of over 10,000%. Its integration into the Solana ecosystem and involvement in decentralized applications like BonkSwap show its potential. In the current market cycle, BONK’s growth and ecosystem presence make it a notable player. MEW: A cat-themed cryptocurrency challenging dog coins MEW is a cat-themed cryptocurrency entering a market filled with dog-themed coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. It aims to stand out by offering unique features and technologies that differentiate it from its canine counterparts. MEW seeks to attract users who are interested in meme coins but also value innovation and potential utility.

37513529,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=660700,1733940015,"XRP Price Defies Bearish Crypto Trend, Rallies 6%: Key Drivers Revealed","In a notable display of resilience amidst a broadly subdued crypto market, XRP has surged 6.7% in the last 24 hours. Following a dip to as low as $1.90 on December 10, the asset is once again trading above $2.36, defying the predominantly bearish sentiment that has taken hold of the altcoin sector. While most altcoins have posted losses or traded sideways over the same period, and Bitcoin has registered only a modest 0.7% gain, XRP’s recent outperformance stands out as a clear anomaly. So, why Is XRP outperforming the crypto market? #1 Imminent Launch Of Ripple’s Stablecoin RLUSD A key catalyst behind XRP’s rally appears to be the imminent launch of Ripple’s long-discussed stablecoin, RLUSD. Yesterday, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed via X that RLUSD had secured a pivotal regulatory approval. He stated: “This just in…we have final approval from NYDFS for RLUSD! Exchange and partner listings will be live soon – and reminder: when RLUSD is live, you’ll hear it from Ripple first.” Related Reading: Analyst Sets $4.40 XRP Target As 3rd-Straight Bull Pennant Forms RLUSD, currently in beta testing on both the Ethereum network and the XRP Ledger (XRPL), has sparked enthusiasm within the XRP community. Members speculate that the stablecoin’s introduction could catalyze increased liquidity and utility for XRP, and the anticipation may be contributing to a surge in speculative interest and so-called “FOMO” (fear of missing out). #2 Strong XRP On-Chain Activity On-chain analysis from Santiment points to encouraging metrics for XRP. The firm noted that “Mean Dollar Invested Age is flashing a bullish signal,” highlighting that younger coin age distributions often precede continued rallies. According to Santiment, the Mean Age of investment for XRP is 865 days (22% younger in 14 weeks). Thus, activity on the XRP network is increasing, with historically similar patterns not reversing until these key indicators start reversing. Related Reading: Weekly Bull Flag Appears On XRP Price Chart, Why A Double-Digit Is Still Feasible “This is one of the key indicators throughout the history of each coin’s lifespan that helps validate that a bull market can and should continue. The 2017 and 2021 bull markets similarly did not come to a halt until assets’ mean ages started going ‘up’ (getting older) again. Though short-term price volatility can continue to be expected, consider this a very valuable bode of confidence if you remain bullish on market prices in the mid and long term,” Santiment states. #3 Whales Buy The Dip Amid Bullish Technical Setup From a technical perspective, the XRP price structure remains extremely bullish on the higher time frames. On the daily chart, XRP managed to hold support above the April 2021 high at $1.96, rebounding swiftly towards the 1.272 Fibonacci extension level near $2.42, where it currently hovers. A sustained break above $2.42 could further reinforce the bullish narrative. Notably, whales recognized the chance and bought the retracement. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted via X: “In the recent dip, whales bought over 100 million XRP!” Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",POSITIVE,XRP,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-price-defies-bearish-crypto-trend/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

37513934,https://blockworks.co/news/commonware-optimized-blockchain-development,1733940000,Commonware unveils ‘anti-framework’ for optimized blockchain development,"Building an application or a rollup today isn’t difficult. Whether it’s the OP Stack or Arbitrum Orbit, there are a variety of blockchain technology frameworks to choose from. These tech stacks are tremendously useful for builders to go to market quickly, but they’re also constraining in practice. Crypto is still a young industry, and businesses seek increasingly differentiated architectures to suit their unique use cases. As such, most applications do not fit into an existing technology stack framework. For instance, an application builder may want to change what happens in a block, or introduce custom cryptography, rather than being tied to the rules of how an L1 blockchain’s state is governed. So developers frequently fork and customize to get what they need. Cosmos’ CometBFT consensus layer (itself a fork of Tendermint Core) for instance, is one of the most frequently forked consensus mechanisms by projects such as Sei , Celestia, dYdX , Penumbra and more. For a thousand chains or dapps to bloom, builders want even more modularity than simply choosing between data availability layers or consensus mechanisms. That’s the bet middleware blockchain infrastructure platform Commonware is making. Commonware is an open-source “anti-framework” set of primitives that developers can use to build and reassemble their applications without resorting to a complicated fork. Today, I'm excited to share @commonwarexyz raised $9M from @HaunVentures , @dragonfly_xyz , and an experienced group of builders to rethink the way blockchains are built for the decade ahead. Unveiling Commonware: the Anti-Framework pic.twitter.com/C5EbpHZ76b — patrickogrady.xyz (@_patrickogrady) December 11, 2024 Led by a $9 million fundraise backed by Haun Ventures and Dragonfly Capital, Commonware wants to break the existing “one-size-fits-all” mold that comes with today’s technology stacks. “Frameworks today like the Cosmos SDK and CometBFT is open and flexible in a few specific ways, but I argue that you get stuck eventually,” said Commonware founder Patrick O’Grady. “You have to redo and fork and rebuild a lot of stuff, and builders end up spending too much time dealing with the abstractions rather than focusing on the product.” Existing frameworks prescribe a standard way to build an app. In contrast, Commonware does not tie developers into any specific security configurations, hardcoded block formats, mempool policies or execution rules. Developers building with Commonware can custom design their own mempool configurations, or introduce their own execution environments, rather than having to comply with prescribed block formats. On the consensus layer, they can determine how validators are rewarded. “We want builders to be able to use Commonware to couple their existing applications with their own custom capabilities,” O’Grady said. “Developers shouldn’t have to decide which ecosystem’s religion they want to be part of first, then build their application as a second step.” For that reason, Commonware’s set of architectural primitives is best thought of as an optimized, architectural way to build in Web3. One such primitive is the consensus::simplex , a minimalistic consensus primitive that provides Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) agreements. For Commonware chains to communicate with one another, the team plans to incorporate an optional threshold signature primitive into its consensus construction. The threshold signature would enable any chain to generate a static public key and verify outputs from other chains, thereby enabling efficient point-to-point communication without chains sharing any similar overlapping trust assumptions. Commonware is not striving to create another “chain of chains” architecture such as the OP Superchain , which binds you into preset execution rules, O’Grady explains. It further extends the modular evolution of blockchains that Ethereum’s rollup-centric roadmap kickstarted and augments existing virtual machines, rather than completely replacing them.

But Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao says on the social media platform X that he has an even more simple solution. “Simple. Accept Bitcoin payments?” Zhao also acknowledged that BTC isn’t a perfect payment method, however. “I paid $17.08 in Bitcoin yesterday and had to wait 15 minutes for it to confirm. Still better than TradFi though. I didn’t have to call anyone to fix it. It just worked after 15 min.” The National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank, submitted the Amazon shareholder proposal last week, requesting that the tech giant’s board “conduct an assessment to determine if adding Bitcoin to the Company’s treasury is in the best long-term interests of shareholders.” The think tank floated a similar proposal to Microsoft earlier this year, but the firm’s shareholders voted against it this week. Microsoft’s board formally recommended shareholders vote against the proposal. The “no” vote triggered another volatile move in the price of the leading crypto asset, with BTC dropping from a 24-hour high of $98,327 to as low as $94,386.

The scheme , run through entities under the ‘Solanofi’ name, targeted over 1,500 individuals, primarily Spanish-speaking members of the pastor’s church in Pasco, Washington. Valued at $5.9 million, the scheme reportedly promised customers guaranteed profits of up to 34.9% monthly by claiming to operate a risk-free leveraged staking platform for cryptocurrency trading.

To maintain the façade, Pinillo provided customers with fake online account statements and offered 15% referral bonuses to encourage others to join the scheme. These actions effectively created a Ponzi-like structure, using funds from new investors to pay fictitious profits to earlier participants.

However, stablecoins, which account for more than four-fifths of cryptocurrency trading volume, challenge this narrative.” The report highlights that most stablecoins are pegged to the US dollar, with issuers holding reserves in US dollars and US Treasury bonds. Citi argues that increased regulation and legitimacy around stablecoins could further solidify the dollar’s global dominance. Related News: Bitcoin is Going Up - We're Above $101,000! Here's Why and Latest Data “Greater regulatory clarity could potentially further increase the appeal of stablecoins,” Citi analysts wrote. “If so, stablecoin issuers’ demand for U.S. Treasury bonds could increase from around 1% of purchases today. Rather than displacing the dollar, this form of cryptocurrency could make the dollar more accessible to the world and solidify the U.S. currency’s long-standing global dominance.” Citi’s report also included data showing the growing importance of stablecoins.

Following a rapid presale that raised $7 million and attracted nearly 20,000 investors, CYBRO is preparing to list on Gate.io and other major exchanges on December 14th. During the presale, CYBRO’s price surged 450%, climbing from $0.01 to $0.055. Now set to debut at $0.06, the token has generated immense demand, with market analysts forecasting potential 1000% growth once it hits the open market. With strong fundamentals and growing momentum, CYBRO is shaping up to be a standout player in the DeFi space. What’s fueling the buzz around CYBRO? CYBRO’s platform merges advanced AI with accessible tools to make decentralized finance investing seamless for all types of investors. Key milestones achieved during the presale include: CYBRO App Launch : Over 30 vaults now live, offering competitive APYs tailored to diverse investment strategies. Blast Index Debut : A one-click investment tool integrating with lending protocols, simplifying DeFi participation. Rapid Platform Development : CYBRO has built a solid foundation for user-friendly, innovative DeFi experiences. The roadmap through 2025 promises even more transformative features, including leverage farming, lending aggregators, and next-generation AI tools, solidifying CYBRO’s position as a game-changer in the DeFi ecosystem. Don’t miss out before CYBRO’s market debut With its listing imminent and a track record of strong performance, CYBRO is poised to capture investor attention and deliver substantial returns. As demand surges, now could be the time to join the momentum before CYBRO redefines decentralized finance. Cardano’s ADA: A scalable and sustainable blockchain platform Cardano is a major player in the cryptocurrency market. It is a flexible and scalable blockchain platform designed for smart contracts. This allows developers to create decentralized finance apps, crypto tokens, and games. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, competes with Ethereum’s ETH. Users can store value, make payments, and stake ADA on the Cardano network. Cardano uses an energy-efficient proof-of-stake mechanism called Ouroboros. This makes it more environmentally friendly than systems using proof-of-work. The blockchain is divided into two layers: the Cardano Settlement Layer for transactions and the Cardano Computing Layer for smart contracts. This design enhances its ability to process transactions, potentially up to 1,000,000 per second. Cardano offers secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts, improving blockchain efficiency and scalability. XRP: A fast, low-cost digital currency for borderless transactions XRP is a cryptocurrency supported by the XRP Ledger. It is designed as a digital currency that is fast, low-cost, and open. It allows for borderless transactions and is resistant to censorship or counterfeiting. XRP operates on a decentralized system without a central authority. This makes transactions irreversible and secure. It does not require a bank account for settlements. XRP was created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz. It was launched with an initial supply of 100 billion XRP, with 80 billion gifted to Ripple for further development. Ripple uses XRP to improve network liquidity and support the ecosystem, controlling supply release through escrow. Conclusion While ADA and XRP continue to capture attention, their short-term potential appears limited. In contrast, CYBRO emerges as a standout in the current bull run. As a cutting-edge DeFi platform, CYBRO allows investors to maximize earnings through AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain. Its features include attractive staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases. With a focus on transparency, compliance, and quality, CYBRO provides a superior user experience with seamless deposits and withdrawals. The project has garnered strong interest from crypto whales and influencers, marking it as a promising opportunity in the market.

37514482,https://invezz.com/?p=2383818,1733939191,"SOS, BGB shine with Bitcoin back over $100K but correction looms","After retesting the $94,000 support level twice over the past week, Bitcoin continued its recovery towards $100,000 on Wednesday. Bitcoin’s recovery also reignited momentum across the altcoin market as several of the top 99 cryptocurrencies had flipped towards the green with the leading performers posting double-digit gains. The overall cryptocurrency market capitalization increased by 1.7% in the past 24 hours, recovering from a low of $3.4 trillion from the previous day to over $3.7 trillion at the time of writing. However, according to some experts, the flagship cryptocurrency isn’t out of the woods just yet. Meanwhile, the altcoin sector had also lost some of the momentum as the Altcoin Season Index had dipped to the mid-60s from the 87 seen last week. What’s next for Bitcoin price? According to one metric, experts believe Bitcoin could see some more correction. Veteran trader Peter Brandt believes a sharp correction is due, based on Bitcoin’s performance against gold futures. He pointed to the Bitcoin-to-Gold ratio which had risen to hit a key resistance zone. Specifically, the metric has rallied to a level between 36-to-1 and 37-to-1, meaning one Bitcoin is equivalent to 36–37 units of gold futures. Traders often associate this range with a local market top. This coincides with the ratio’s weekly relative strength index breaching the overbought threshold of 70, signaling potential overextension of the current rally. Historically, such levels have been followed by significant price corrections. Crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe shares a similar view, anticipating further downside for Bitcoin in the short term. Poppe explained that the leading cryptocurrency is mimicking price action seen during December 2023 when Bitcoin corrected till February before embarking on a rally. However, this time around he doesn’t expect the correction to be as deep and expects both Bitcoin and altcoins to rally soon. However, according to trader pseudonymous analyst Skew, Bitcoin bulls need to regain control above $98,000 before rallying above $100,000 again. He pointed to an equilibrium forming in Bitcoin’s spot price action on Binance, with a key resistance and support zone shaping a tug-of-war between buyers and sellers. Reclaiming $98,000 would signal buyer dominance and the potential for continued upward momentum. When writing, Bitcoin had just surged past $100,000 once again trading at $100,598, up 5.0% in the last 24 hours. Altcoins were also showing signs of recovery, and the top-performing altcoins were: Solana Swap Solana Swap (SOS) led the highest gains among the top 100 crypto assets. The altcoin rose 27.2% over the past day extending its weekly gains to over 97% while trading at $4.65 at the time of writing. SOS’s market cap was close to surpassing the $2.5 billion mark while daily trading volume for the token hovered over $2.48 million. Source: CoinMarketCap SOS’s recent gains are due to excitement about the upcoming launch of Solana Swap’s official version. The decentralized exchange leverages advanced AI algorithms through its integration with Google DeepMind’s open-source model and the speed of the Solana blockchain to make trading more efficient, secure, and affordable compared to traditional exchanges. SOS reached its all-time high of $5.69 on Nov. 21 this year, which is 18.4% higher than its price when writing. Bitget Token Over the last 24 hours, Bitget Token (BGB) rose 21.5% to a new all-time high of $3.29 while raising its market cap to over $4.5 billion. This brought its year-to-date gains up to 475% at press time making it a top-performing altcoin this year. Source: CoinMarketCap While there is no apparent reason for the token to rise, a lot of the momentum came from the exchange’s performance over the past months. Notably, the exchange has seen a surge in users over the past month, driven in part by the success of its launchpools, which have drawn a lot of attention. Meanwhile, technicals for BGB are also strong as explained by several analysts on X, who are pointing to a rally towards $5 next. Brett Brett (BRETT) surged 21.1% over the last day exchanging hands at $0.1867 per coin while bringing its market cap back over $1.8 billion at press time. Source: CoinMarketCap The Ethereum-based meme coin rallied following its listing on Klever Swap, the exchange feature within the Klever Wallet. Altcoin typically tends to rally following a listing on a major exchange or a significant development in the related project’s ecosystem. BRETT is also benefiting from the excitement in the Ethereum community following Ethereum’s recent surge above $4,000, with the largest altcoin still up 7% over the past day. Additionally, the meme coin is gaining momentum amid a broader rally in the meme coin market, which has climbed 3.3% in the past day.

The data points out that leverage in Bitcoin is easing, and the USDT balances held in exchanges are surging. The data gives a possible impression that cascade liquidation risk could be reduced as USDT collateral rises. CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju shared valuable insights about the prevailing market conditions in the Bitcoin ecosystem. According to the executive, the Bitcoin market is showing signs of a declining cascade liquidation risk, with open interest on BTC-USDT futures now down 7% from its all-time high recorded on 21 November. The reduction in open interest on BTC-USDT futures suggests a potential decrease in leveraged positions, which could lead to a more stable market environment. Exchanges held USDT balances rise, CryptoQuant data shows Leverage in #Bitcoin market is easing. BTC-USDT futures open interest is down 7% from its peak, while exchange-held USDT balances have surged 32% in a month. If the deposited $USDT is for futures trading, more USDT collateral reduces cascade liquidation risk. pic.twitter.com/ASOUIH0x5U — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) December 11, 2024 Ki Young Ju also noted that USDT balances held in exchanges have risen by 32% in the last month. The executive highlighted that the USDT could be used as collateral for futures trading positions on the exchanges, therefore reducing cascade liquidation risks. The broader crypto market views the rising exchange-held USDT balances as a potential buffer against selling pressure from market participants. According to additional data from the blockchain analytics firm, the leverage ratio, which divides global futures open interest by the number of coins held on exchanges, has also been declining since November 25th. The metric has been on a progressive surge since August 12th, peaking at $0.2459 before dipping to $0.2237 as of December 10th. The recent decline in the Bitcoin Estimated Leverage Ratio shows a prevailing trend developing among investors toward lower leverage in the futures market. Bitcoin reserves in centralized exchanges decline to ATLs Meanwhile, data from CryptoQuant also shows that Bitcoin reserves in all centralized exchanges have declined to an all-time low of 2.4 million BTC. The data also shows that the exchange reserves have been steadily declining since the beginning of the year. Declining reserves indicate higher buying pressure, and investors are confident about the prevailing bullish market sentiment. The data also shows that investors prefer holding their assets in non-custodial wallets, showing more demand for Bitcoin. Bitcoin demand is also evident on the U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, which currently hold $107.76 billion worth of Bitcoin, according to Sosovalue. Source: Tradingview Bitcoin has risen 4.72% in the last 24 hours and 4.75% in the last seven days. According to CoinMarketCap, the crypto asset is currently retailing at $100,434 with a market cap of $1.988 trillion and a 24-hour trading volume of $95.6 billion. TradingView also shows the asset trading between $104,082 and $90,589. However, the bulls appear to be in control of the market, and the asset is more likely to break the range and continue its upward trajectory that started in mid-September.

Pepe Loves Santa (PEPESAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPESAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Loves Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Loves Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Loves Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Loves Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Loves Santa by entering its contract address – 9FuN9o4pQgF3NF1v2saWvb7b9hNKDJ1DGU6LSbur437Q – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPESAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/pepe-loves-santa-pepesan-will-explode-over-19000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

The improving sentiments have triggered notable price surges in ADA, rescuing the altcoin from yesterday’s plunge. Cardano’s native token jumped from a daily low of $0.9182 to the $1.1049 peak. That translated to an impressive 20.82% daily surge. The upside stance emerged as cryptocurrencies jumped as the financial space braced for US inflation data later today. The upcoming economic report will likely confirm the movement of lowering inflation has halted, though not to a point where the Fed will refrain from rate cuts next week. Analysts expect favorable outcomes for cryptocurrencies, forecasting continued gains in December. ADA exchange outflows hint at accumulation The spot outflow/inflow stats show exchanges have witnessed a staggering $185.89 million ADA outflows since early December. Source: Coinglass Outflows mean the transfer of digital tokens from exchanges to individual addresses, highlighting acquisitions. Furthermore, increased outflows suggest possible bullish momentum, confirming a probable buying zone . These trends affirm long-term holders’ confidence in ADA’s future performance. Cardano price actions ADA lost the vital $1 zone on Monday as the Cardano Foundation’s hack deteriorated sentiments around the token . It kick-started recoveries from the lows on Tuesday. Meanwhile, support from long-term investors and whales prevented Cardano from violating the $1 support. ADA trades at $1.09 after slight declines from 24-hour highs.

Meanwhile, Ali Martinez underscored a crucial level that ADA bulls should hold for stable uptrends. The analysts emphasized that $1.20, where about 93K addresses hold 2.54 billion tokens, is vital for Cardano’s upward momentum. Failure to keep $1.20 will likely support bearish actions below the $1 psychological level. Martinez highlighted bearish sentiments threatening the altcoins. For example, approximately 70% of holders are experiencing losses at current prices ( IntoTheBlock data ). Such cases might trigger additional selling momentum, disrupting minor price bounce-backs. Nonetheless, the demand territory at $0.98 – $1.02 provides some encouragement.

One of Trump’s biggest crypto promises is a strategic Bitcoin reserve. This idea is based on a bill proposed by Senator Cynthia Lummis where the US government would buy Bitcoin. This would be a big deal for the market, would drive up the price of Bitcoin and add trillions to its market cap. David Bailey, CEO of Bitcoin Magazine, mentioned earlier this year that Trump thinks the market cap of Bitcoin would be multi-trillion. He later deleted the post but the idea has been floating around and people are speculating about Trump’s impact on Bitcoin’s future. If the US government does a Bitcoin reserve, it would cement Bitcoin as a global asset and mainstream adoption and institutional confidence. Impact on the Bitcoin Market Since Trump won the election in November, Bitcoin’s price has gone from $68,000 to over $103,000. The community celebrated and Trump himself took credit for Bitcoin breaking $100,000. While there are many factors that contributed to the rise of the asset, Trump’s pro-crypto stance definitely helped the market. Trump’s impact on Bitcoin: Strategic Reserve: US buying Bitcoin would mean unprecedented price growth. Market Sentiment: A pro-crypto administration would mean mainstream adoption. Global Leadership: Positioning the US as the leader in blockchain. As Trump gets in, his Bitcoin plans will reshape the role of Bitcoin in the global financial system. Whether his $150,000 target happens or not depends on market and government but the idea itself is already getting the crypto community excited. Bitcoin Price Eyes $105K After Bullish Breakout: Key Levels to Watch Bitcoin (BTC/USD) has broken out of a symmetrical triangle, pushing above the $99,650 pivot point, signaling the start of an uptrend. A bullish engulfing candle on the 2-hour chart reinforces strong buyer momentum. The RSI at 66.31 reflects bullish sentiment but hints at nearing overbought levels. The 50 EMA at $98,201 acts as critical support, supporting a steady upward move. Price targets for the breakout include $102,106 and $105,000, while downside risks are supported at $98,201 and $95,750. Overall, the chart suggests sustained bullish momentum as long as the price holds above $99,650. Key Levels to Watch: Resistance: $102,106, $105,000 Support: $98,201, $95,750, $94,400 The bullish breakout and strong technical support position Bitcoin for further gains, with immediate focus on $102,106 and $105,000. – You might also like Bitcoin Price Prediction 2024 – 2034 The post Trump Wants Bitcoin at $150,000 – Will His Return Spark the Next Big Rally? appeared first on Cryptonews .",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/trump-wants-bitcoin-at-150000-will-his-return-spark-the-next-big-rally/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/37516232.jpeg

This move underlines the commitment of Binance Labs to furthering blockchain technology and the wider use of stablecoins. The funding represents a key milestone in expanding the capabilities and accessibility of stablecoins within Solana’s fast-growing ecosystem. Funding to Strengthen Stablecoin Adoption On December 11, Binance Labs announced it had participated in the pre-seed funding round of Quine Co., the core contributor to the Perena platform. The funding is meant to smoothen the adoption of stablecoins by solving some of the important pain points such as fragmentation in liquidity and decreasing risks during the issuance of stablecoins. With Solana already positioned as a hub for scalable and efficient blockchain applications, the integration of Perena further strengthens the ecosystem’s position in the DeFi space. Perena’s Vision: New Generation in Stablecoin Infrastructure Perena develops the efficient infrastructure of stablecoins that allows users to mint liquid synthetic dollars via stableswaps. Such a novelty approach has made access to stablecoins easy and yield generation on tokenized real-world assets, and thus it forms the cornerstone for on-chain financial ecosystems. The protocol recently introduced Numéraire, a feature designed to eliminate the need for active liquidity market makers. By reducing capital requirements for launching stablecoins, developers and projects face lower barriers to entry, paving the way for broader adoption and further innovation. These advancements further reinforce Perena’s mission of bringing traditional banking efficiency to the decentralized world while creating a seamless bridge to conventional finance through blockchain technology. Binance Labs’ Commitment to Web3 Innovation Max Coniglio, Investment Director at Binance Labs, expressed confidence in Perena’s potential: “We are excited to back Perena in their mission to onboard the next wave of stablecoin users on Solana. This aligns with our commitment to supporting early-stage projects driving Web3 innovation.” The funding will enable Perena to expand its team, grow its community, and further develop its stablecoin solutions on Solana, ensuring long-term success and adoption. Solana’s Role as a Stablecoin Powerhouse: Solana has already surpassed Ethereum in stablecoin transaction volume, signaling its preeminence in the blockchain space. Perena’s work complements this position, solving fundamental gaps in the infrastructure with efficient solutions to support the growth of DeFi.

Bitcoin: The original cryptocurrency and its ongoing potential Bitcoin (BTC) is the first cryptocurrency, introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto to enable decentralized peer-to-peer transactions without the need for banks. It operates on blockchain technology, where transactions are verified by a network of nodes through a process called mining. Miners solve complex puzzles to validate transactions and are rewarded with bitcoins. The supply of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million coins, and approximately every four years, a “halving” event reduces miners’ rewards by half. This scarcity can influence its value. With its pioneering technology and limited supply, Bitcoin continues to have significant potential. In the current market cycle, it may look attractive to those interested in alternative investments and decentralized finance. Conclusion While BTC and other major coins may have less short-term potential, DOGEN stands out. Designed for those seeking luxury and success, it is expected to grow 700% by the end of presale, with potential for massive returns this altcoin season. Following successful tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat, DOGEN builds a community of alpha leaders offering real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters.

37512645,https://crypto.news/?p=14318406,1733938347,Aave to debut on Linea following fork rival ZeroLend’s controversy,"Aave is about to launch its protocol on Linea following a community vote, months after its forked rival faced scrutiny on the same network. The Aave ( AAVE ) community has given the green light to proposal #5ae27, which suggests deploying the Aave V3 protocol on Linea, a zk-rollup network supported by Consensys. The proposal, first submitted on Nov. 19, saw overwhelming support, with more than 636,000 AAVE tokens cast in favour, signalling a strong push for Aave to broaden its reach in decentralized finance. Table of Contents Why Linea What it means for Aave The Shadow of ZeroLend Governance and next steps Why Linea Linea is a layer-2 network built on Ethereum , which is powered by a zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine. Developed by Consensys, Linea aims to fix the common problems with Ethereum, like slow speeds and high fees. What really sets Linea apart from its competitors, though, is its integration with other Consensys-owned products. For instance, Consensys controls the MetaMask non-custodial crypto wallet and the blockchain infrastructure provider Infura. You might also like: Consensys establishes a Swiss non-profit to support Linea decentralization With MetaMask’s 30 million active users, this could give Aave a significant opportunity to tap into a much larger user base. However, it remains uncertain whether this expansion will be successful in the long term. As of press time, the Linea network holds nearly $450 million in total value locked, according to data from DefiLlama. What it means for Aave With the expansion to Linea, Aave hopes to offer better scalability, faster transactions, and lower costs for its users. Another bonus is the integration of the protocol’s GHO stablecoin with MetaMask’s debit card, which only works on Linea. However, details about this feature are still vague and seem more like a teaser for now. Top protocols by TVL | Source: DefiLlama It’s worth noting that Aave alone is already one of the largest defi protocols, managing over $21 billion in TVL across 12 blockchains, next only to staking protocol Lido, which boasts over $36 billion in TVL, per data from DefiLlama. Linea’s zk-rollup technology could potentially play a key role in making Aave’s services more efficient and cost-effective as the protocol also plans to allocate ecosystem incentives, such as stablecoin incentives, to encourage adoption on Linea. The Shadow of ZeroLend What’s interesting is that Aave’s expansion to Linea comes just months after its competitor ZeroLend attempted a similar move. ZeroLend, which appears to be fork of Aave, faced criticism and controversy earlier this year. The thing is that critics accused the protocol of being a low-effort fork of Aave, with one governance delegate even calling it “Aave’s codebase with a high inflation token slapped on top.” The biggest protocol on linea (consensys) is a copy-paste aave-fork that forgot to change hotlinks of documentation which still links to aave docs ethereum people should shut the fuck up for 30 days and look at the bullshit they're peddling to the world go keep a clean house pic.twitter.com/MibgMXppuo — imajin (@majinsayan) July 6, 2024 Moreover, the fork also found itself in hot water when users found out that the mobile version of its website was redirected to Aave’s FAQ section, as reported by Protos. Nonetheless, despite some controversy, ZeroLend still managed to capture over $250 million in TVL on Linea, accounting for over one-third of the network’s total TVL in a moment. Governance and next steps The issue with the proposal to deploy Aave V3 on Linea is that it seems to have received a huge backing from one voter only: the Aave Chan Initiative, which is a group that guides governance discussions within the Aave community. It also appears to be the author of the proposal itself. However, it’s yet to be seen how the wider Aave community will eventually respond to the expansion. The voting results for the 5ae27 proposal | Source: Snapshot According to the proposal’s voting history, nearly 58% of the voting power is concentrated in a single address, which appears to be controlled by the Aave Chan Initiative. Another AaveDAO delegate, under the alias “ezr3al.eth,” contributed 24.3% of the total voting power in support of the proposal. “By deploying on Linea, Aave can leverage high throughput and fast finality, enabling efficient transaction processing and reduced gas fees,” ACI said in the proposal description. It also emphasized that it “did not receive compensation for creating this proposal.” The next steps involve working with development teams to implement the deployment on Linea. Risk parameters for wrapped tokens assets like Wrapped Ethereum ( WETH ), Wrapped Bitcoin ( WBTC ) and Circle’s stablecoin USD Coin ( USDC ) have already been established, designed to ensure the protocol’s security and performance on the new network, ACI claims. AAVE’s price showed minimal reaction to the news, trading at $282.74, reflecting a slight 0.05% decrease in the past 24 hours.

37512560,https://thecoinrise.com/italy-makes-u-turn-on-hiking-capital-gains-tax-for-crypto-transactions/,1733938163,Italy Makes U-turn on Hiking Capital Gains Tax For Crypto Transactions,"Italy is having a rethink concerning its initial plan to increase taxes on cryptocurrency capital gains. Under the 2025 budget, still awaiting approval from the Italian parliament, the Treasury planned to hike taxation on capital gains from cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) to 42% from 26%. The rising popularity of crypto investments fuelled the move to increase capital gains tax. Generally, cryptocurrency transaction taxation remains a contentious issue. The change of mind comes after the country received some backlash from members of the burgeoning industry over the decision. No More Prejudice About Cryptocurrencies Members of the co-ruling League party opine that such a move would negatively on the economy of the country. Lawmaker Giulio Centemero and Treasury Junior Minister Federico Freni perceived the tax increase as having to do with prejudice about cryptocurrencies. However, they also mentioned that an end has come to that era. Therefore, instead of the intended increment, “The tax increase will be significantly reduced during the parliamentary work,” lawmaker Giulio Centemero and Treasury Junior Minister Federico Freni said. It is uncertain whether the capital gains tax will remain at 26% or move slightly to around 28%. Czech Republic Proposes Simple Crypto Tax Regime Many other countries are either considering crypto taxation or have already kickstarted the exercise. As announced by Prime Minister Petr Fiala of the Czech Republic, the nation is on the verge of passing legislation that would dramatically simplify the taxation of cryptocurrencies. To encourage innovation and crypto adoption, citizens who have held cryptocurrencies for more than three years would be exempt from capital gains tax upon selling. Also, there would be no need to report transactions valued below 100,000 koruna, approximately $4,200 annually. South Korea Will Commence Crypto Taxation in 2027 South Korea is still determining if introducing crypto taxation at the time is the right step to take. Although it was initially scheduled to commence as of January 2025, the South Korea Democratic Party (KDP) has agreed to postpone introducing a crypto gains tax by another two years . This is the third time South Korea will push back its digital asset capital gains tax implementation. Ultimately, this reflects the ongoing debates and controversy over the timing and impact of taxing cryptocurrency transactions.

Kraken, one of the largest U.S.-based crypto exchanges, has listed Solana native meme coin tokens FWOG ( FWOG ), GOAT ( GOAT ), and SPX ( SPX ) for spot trading, expanding its crypto array for users. The platform had previously added FWOG, GOAT, and SPX to its listing roadmap last week, intending to finalize trading support for the meme coins on Wednesday, Dec. 11. FWOG, GOAT, and SPX recorded gains on the day. However, a meme market-wide rise at press time was the likely cause, and price surges may be unrelated to the Kraken listing. You might also like: Kraken listing FWOF, GOAT, and SPX next week, starting DYDX migration The addition of meme coins to major exchanges has surged since Donald Trump’s re-election, which signaled a shift in the U.S.’s stance on crypto and spurred wider adoption of digital assets. According to crypto.news, Coinbase just added PNUT ( PNUT ) to its listing roadmap after including tokens like Pepe ( PEPE ), Dogwifhat ( WIF ), and Floki ( FLOKI ). Meme coin holders and community members often praise exchange listings as bullish. Still, some within the industry have opted out of the meme mani, preferring projects with more sound utility and real-world impact. In a private note, Safe co-founder Lukas Schor said “Meme coins are fun, but so are fundaments.” It’s time we revolutionized the financial landscape, not just replicated old financial products and past trends. To see sustainable growth, we need to focus on core values like ownership, privacy, and financial autonomy. While some OG memecoins indeed created community, narrative, and lore, most of today’s memecoins create very little sustainable value and rather live purely on speculation. This inevitably leads to an ever-shortening lifespan where people just try to catch the next wave and then exit as soon as possible. This means that memecoin deployers have to constantly stretch the boundaries in order to gain attention, leading to dystopian episodes going as far as people showing nudity, applying violence or seeking attention through other ways to shock in order to stick out.

The partnership aims to bring premium private market investments on-chain, Plume Network and Chateau Capital announced in a press release .

These assets include hedge fund strategies, pre-IPO shares, and private equity investments, among others. Plume will offer access to these investments starting as low as $1 USDC, allowing retail investors to participate in opportunities traditionally reserved for institutional investors.

Juan Otero, co-founder and CEO of Travala, said the Bitcoin and AVA reserve was a milestone for the company, reflecting significant growth from $59.6 million in 2023 to over $100 million.

This Vital Metric Suggests So,"TL;DR After a correction below $94,500, BTC rebounded to almost $99,000, with certain indicators signaling a further push to the north. Some analysts see BTC’s next targets ranging from $101,000 to $275,000, supported by bullish technical patterns and market sentiment. New BTC Rally Incoming? The primary cryptocurrency became the talk of the town at the start of the month when its price finally conquered the $100,000 psychological level. On December 5, it rallied to a new all-time high of over $103,500, triggering huge enthusiasm across the crypto community.

BTC Price, Source: CoinGecko The beginning of this week, though, offered a severe correction that suppressed the valuation below $94,500. In the past several hours, however, BTC has recovered some ground and is currently trading at approximately $98,700 (per CoinGecko’s data). One important indicator suggests that the leading digital asset might be poised for a much more substantial resurgence in the short term. This is the BTC supply stored at exchanges, which, according to CryptoQuant’s data, has dropped to a level last observed in the summer of 2018. The development signals a potential shift from centralized platforms toward private wallets, which can be viewed as a bullish factor since it reduces the immediate selling pressure. Bitcoin’s Network Value to Metcalfe (NVM) ratio is also worth mentioning. The metric provides insights into the relationship between the asset’s market capitalization and its adoption or usage. Readings below 2 typically indicate that BTC might be undervalued , suggesting a potential price uptrend. Currently, the NVM is set at approximately 1.5. How High Can BTC Fly? Numerous analysts described the recent market pullback as a buying opportunity. Ali Martinez, for instance, predicted that BTC will jump to as high as $275,000, advising investors to “buy the dip” without overleveraging. He based his forecast on “a cup and handle” pattern formed on the asset’s price chart. Buy the dip, and don’t overleverage! #Bitcoin $BTC will reach $275,000, based on this cup and handle pattern! pic.twitter.com/cqf99cBtmB — Ali (@ali_charts) December 10, 2024 Captain Faibik chipped in, too, albeit making a less bullish prediction. The X user noted BTC’s rebound, claiming the price may soon test the $101,000 resistance level. “Once the critical resistance is cleared , next target is likely to be $110K,” they assumed.

37512095,https://crypto.news/?p=14318496,1733937145,Shiba Inu’s chart pattern turned $750 into $150K—this new token could follows suit,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Shiba Inu’s explosive rise turned $750 into $150K in weeks. Now, Rexas Finance shows similar potential. Table of Contents Shiba Inu and the inverse head and shoulders pattern Is Rexas Finance the next token to follow the same path? Rexas Finance’s ecosystem and presale momentum Thanks to its explosive climb, Shiba Inu (SHIB) became a household brand in the crypto space in 2021. With great investor interest and notable price behavior, what started as a joke currency swiftly became a major market competitor. However, SHIB’s capacity to create a strong chart pattern indicating a significant change in market momentum distinguished it. This pattern transformed meager $750 early investments into an amazing $150,000 within weeks. A new currency that appeared today, Rexas Finance (RXS), is showing similar characteristics, and investors are closely monitoring it with the expectation of duplicating SHIB’s success. Shiba Inu and the inverse head and shoulders pattern The Inverse Head and Shoulders (IH&S) pattern set Shiba Inu on his remarkable ascent in 2021. SHIB created this classic reversal pattern between February and April of that year; it is well known for its dependability in indicating positive price reversals. Three troughs—the left shoulder, the head, and the right shoulder—define the IH&S pattern. The left shoulder developed for SHIB in February, the head formed in March, and the right shoulder developed in April. A “neckline” caps this progression by confirming the positive reversal when breached. After a neckline breach in April 2021, SHIB’s price jumped from a paltry $0.00000043 to an all-time high of $0.000089. Within 25 weeks, this spectacular surge transformed a $750 investment into $150,000, permanently securing Shiba Inu’s place in crypto history. Is Rexas Finance the next token to follow the same path? By 2024, Rexas Finance is starting to show up as the next token, possibly replicating SHIB’s success. With only one click, this creative startup redefines asset ownership and tokenization so users can purchase and trade real-world assets anywhere. Rexas Finance enables consumers to tokenize almost any asset, including real estate, art, intellectual property, and commodities, whether full ownership or fractional shares. Investors already find interest in Rexas Finance’s presale momentum. The cryptocurrency has sold around 314.6 million tokens via its venues and raised approximately $23.82 million. Having been in its ninth presale stage ahead of time, sRXS is currently valued at $0.125, a notable rise from its starting presale price. Analysts are starting to compare Rexas Finance’s chart and Shiba Inu’s 2021 pattern technically. Early signs point to RXS developing an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern, which would be a powerful bullish signal if completed. Market analysts project a guaranteed nearly 2x return by the end of its presale so that the RXS coin will hit $0.20 upon listing. This shows durability and price increase. If Rexas Finance finishes its IH&S shape, some analysts believe it may have an explosive surge akin to Shiba Inu. With RXS’s original idea and strong ecosystem, its price might fly to $25, faster than SHIB managed with a $750,000 investment. Rexas Finance’s ecosystem and presale momentum Rexas Finance distinguishes itself from other tokens mainly with its strong ecosystem. The Rexas Token Builder and Rexas Launchpad on the platform streamline the tokenizing process so that people and companies may generate tokens for their assets without involving difficult coding. This usefulness is mostly driving the increasing investor trust in RXS. Certik, one of the most reputable blockchain security companies, has also audited Rexas Finance, strengthening confidence within its community. A key component of long-term success, this audit guarantees that the platform’s code is safe and devoid of vulnerabilities. Rexas Finance’s presale performance is evidence of its promise. From its first presale stage, the token has already seen a 4x price rise; it is on target to gain even more. Although its listed price is expected to be $0.20, market analysts feel this could be only the start. With strong market conditions and a positive technical setup, RXS might follow Shiba Inu’s path, where an explosive breakout follows the first price consolidation. Shiba Inu’s 2021 climb mirrors the way strong technical patterns like the Inverse Head and Shoulders may propel significant price rallies. With its presale performance, ecosystem value, and developing technical pattern generating great interest, Rexas Finance could be emulating SHIB.

In a recent social media post, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart noted that MicroStrategy could be reclassified as a financial stock due to its substantial Bitcoin holdings and financial engineering activities. Such a change would disqualify the company from selection to the Nasdaq 100.

According to Seyffart, while MicroStrategy is classified as a technology stock due to its software-as-a-service business, its significant Bitcoin holdings and aspirations to become a “Bitcoin bank” could prompt a reclassification as a financial stock. “If the ICB reclassifies MicroStrategy as a financial stock, it would be ineligible for the Nasdaq 100.The next change could come on March 21, though the process would have start by Jan.31,” Seyffart shared in his analysis. “The rules indicate $MSTR should be added in our view but its not official until Nasdaq announces it on Friday,” Seyffart clarified. Eric Balchunas previously suggested that MicroStrategy is likely to be added to the Nasdaq 100 index ($QQQ) on Dec. 23, with an official announcement expected on Dec. 13. He noted that Moderna is the most likely candidate to be removed from the index. $MSTR is likely to be added to $QQQ on 12/23 (w/ announcement coming 12/13). Moderna likely to get boot (symbolic).

DTX is a new player in the DeFi space and is carving out a niche with its hybrid model and centralized and decentralized exchanges. Its presale is up 400%, with over 120,000 users. This is getting attention because it could be the next altcoin to watch. XRP Whales Pivot to DTX Tokens as Presale Soars 400%, Eyeing Game-Changing Hybrid Exchange Ripple is currently trading at $2.22. While this is getting attention, XRP whales are diversifying their portfolios by accumulating DTX tokens, just like the early days of Binance Coin (BNB). Especially because we see a downtrend happening for XRP; however, we will see if the support at $2 will be a support or a resistance for those shorting it. Source: CoinMarketCap DTX Exchange (DTX) is in presale and has already raised $10 million and is growing. Investors who got in early at $0.02 see 500% returns, with the token now at $0.12 in the sixth presale. Market predictions are for further growth, with some thinking it will list at $0.20 – 66% from current prices. The platform is unique because of its hybrid model, which combines centralized and decentralized exchanges. By combining traditional financial instruments with Web3 products, DTX Exchange creates a new space in the online trading market. The newly launched VulcanX blockchain allows for seamless trading of thousands of asset classes in one crypto wallet. Smart contracts and an on-chain order book make the platform even more useful and a potential DeFi game changer. DTX Exchange Draws Binance Coin Comparisons as Speculators Eye 50x Growth Potential DTX Exchange’s path is similar to Binance Coin’s, which went from a utility token with fee discounts to one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap. Currently, the BNB price is trading at around $673. Source: CoinMarketCap DTX Exchange has similar growth potential with governance rights, staking rewards, and exclusive benefits for token holders. That’s why some are speculating DTX could go 50x post-launch like BNB. DTX Exchange’s multi-faceted approach to utility and innovation sets it apart. The platform provides governance rights, staking rewards, an on-chain order book, and access to thousands of asset classes within a single crypto wallet. By filling the gaps in the market, DTX aims to redefine the trading experience for both institutional and retail investors and create an ecosystem that could rival the impact BNB had during its meteoric rise. Utility Tokens Gain Momentum as Investors Pivot to High-Growth Projects Like DTX Exchange (DTX) Ripple whales moving to DTX is a more significant trend: investors are shifting from speculative assets to utility tokens. Established projects like XRP and BNB are still big but have a limited upside compared to new platforms like DTX Exchange , which bring groundbreaking innovation and higher growth. The hybrid exchange model addresses market gaps by offering access to multiple asset classes and advanced trading features. Despite its massive potential, DTX Exchange (DTX) carries the risks of any early-stage cryptocurrency project. The crypto market is volatile; even good projects can face unexpected challenges. Investors should do their research and risk assessment before investing in presale tokens. Key Takeaways And DTX Exchange’s Future The platform already has over 120,000 users and is one of the most anticipated projects in DeFi. With its technology, presale performance, and big-name investors, DTX Exchange is ready to disrupt. Whether it will be like Binance Coin remains to be seen, but DTX looks like a serious altcoin player. XRP whales are moving to this project, and DTX Exchange could change the crypto trading game and give early adopters life-changing returns. Now, the wait is on for DTX to deliver and change the face of DeFi. Find out more on the DTX website , grab presale tokens , or join the DTX community on Telegram .

MMCrypto With a Bold Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction Ethereum (ETH) is rising on the price charts. CoinMarketCap shows that the price of Ethereum has increased by around 15% in the past month alone. Its value moved between $3,100 and over $4,000 during that time. Market expert MMCrypto also made a bullish Ethereum price prediction. According to his X post, this altcoin must break its $4,090 resistance level. Once this happens, Ethereum (ETH) could see a skyrocketing value past the $7,000 mark. The technical analysis of the Ethereum crypto is also bullish. TradingView shows that its value sits above its 20-day EMA of $3,633 and its 30-day EMA of $3,493. Furthermore, its bull-bear power sits at -74, which is in the buy zone and suggests bulls could cause an upswing. Ripple (XRP) Indicators Remain Positive As Price Rises Ripple (XRP) is also making some headlines right now. In the past 30 days, the Ripple price surged from around $0.60 to over $2. In other words, it saw a price surge of over 250% as per CoinMarketCap. TradingView data suggests that this bullish momentum could continue. Ripple (XRP) is valued above its 30-day EMA of $1.75 and its 50-day EMA of $1.43. Plus, its bull-bear power sits at -0.03, which is in the buy zone and suggests bulls could push this value higher. Market analyst Ali also remains optimistic for the Ripple coin. In his new X post, he told his followers that this altcoin is undervalued as it broke out from its multi-year symmetrical triangle. According to his Ripple price prediction, $8.40 is a conservative price target. IntelMarkets (INTL) Price Rises 610%, Further Growth Ahead IntelMarkets (INTL) is making much noise in the crypto space. Its ongoing crypto ICO event has seen great performance, giving early buyers a 610% return. Moreover, IntelMarkets recently completed its KYC process through Codeum. This is a bullish development which shows the safety and trustworthiness of this project. The INTL native token will be the backbone of the IntelMarkets platform. This upcoming trading platform will be AI-powered. In other words, traders will experience many features that do not exist elsewhere. Some include: Self-learning trading robots that learn from their past mistakes. An Intell-Array™ monitoring system that gives one holistic signal backed by 100K data points. The Rodeum AI™ autopilot bots take positions automatically based on trader goals. Currently, one INTL costs only $0.064 in phase seven of its presale, a 610% rise from its starting price. However, phase eight will bring another jump to $0.073. Additionally, traders wait for a Tier-1 crypto exchange listing, which may push this value to $0.11 – a 71% rise from its current price. What Could Come for Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP) & IntelMarkets (INTL)? Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP) and IntelMarkets (INTL) may see big price gains soon. However, experts think that one altcoin may stand out – INTL. This rookie will be tied to the AI market which Statista predicts could be worth $826B by 2030 as well as a smaller market cap. Therefore, its value may surge faster with less money. Because of this, experts foresee a 3x surge for this altcoin in 2025.

MARA's BTC holdings and operations make it undervalued, with 53% of its market cap in BTC. The convertible bonds strategy has driven a 47.6% YTD BTC Yield, yet the market hasn't fully recognized this value. MARA's approach and asset value make it a strong buy, offering significant upside potential at current levels. There's a lot of really interesting things going on in Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). BTC recently crossed $100,000 per coin and $2 trillion market cap, hitting a new milestone that has been in the making for almost 16 years. The corporate adoption of Bitcoin as a strategic treasury asset is also beginning to take off. There is even the suggestion that the US might put BTC on its balance sheet . In this article, I'll focus on a very interesting development in corporate BTC acquisitions— Bitcoin miners that are raising capital to buy BTC. MARA (MARA), the world’s largest publicly traded miner by hashrate, is really leading the way in this front. Raise Capital To Buy Bitcoin - Strategy Overview I’ve covered the general strategy of raising money to buy BTC in several different articles. It is as follows: Buy BTC with cash you have. Issue shares to buy BTC. Borrow money to buy BTC. All of this increases the equity’s exposure to BTC, a highly volatile asset. This makes the stock super volatile. If it hasn’t happened already, get option markets on the equity. Once a high implied volatility is reflected by the option markets, issue convertible bonds at very low-interest rates to buy BTC. The 5th step is essentially the company selling its own volatility to rapidly grow BTC per share, since a convertible bond has a call option embedded within it. Everything leading up to step 5 is about increasing BTC exposure so that BTC’s volatility can be injected and infused into the stock. If all goes well, the stock will have an >100 IV with a vibrant options market. This allows convertible bonds to be issued at near 0% interest rates. Convertible bonds offer many benefits for growing BTC per share: Selling volatility, so you are monetizing something other than your equity and debt Issuing equity at above the market price, based on the conversion premium Minimal interest expenses to service the debt, and in some cases zero expenses Tap into a gigantic market of convertible bonds traders. Their trading activities (delta hedging, gamma scalping) also increase price discovery and volumes in your stock You can immediately take the proceeds to buy BTC, announce a BTC Yield that same day, and then raise more money at a much higher frequency than for anything else The acquisitions of BTC have the effect of cornering the supply and driving up the price of BTC, which makes your BTC more valuable Why Bitcoin Miners Can Do This Really Well If you look back at the steps above, you’ll notice injecting volatility into the stock is vital to successfully executing the strategy. Most stocks take a while to get there because they have an operating business which is not volatile. They need a lot of BTC to really inject volatility. Bitcoin miners are already very volatile because their entire business model centers around BTC. A mining operation is much like a call option on BTC, where the strike price is the cost to mine 1 BTC. Many miners also hold on to the BTC they mine, which gives the balance sheet some higher-than-average BTC exposure. Most miners have over 100 IVs. Therefore, miners can issue convertibles at near 0% rates, and MARA has done this a few times this year . Each time, the company spent most of the money on BTC. The company has 40,435 BTC as of 10 December and a YTD BTC Yield of 47.6%. This means that for every 1 BTC you held via MARA shares on 1 January 2024, you now held 1.476 BTC from those same shares. MARA Looks Pretty Cheap Because BTC is up 118% YTD, a BTC Yield of 47.6% would mean that the value contained within a share should have increased around 165% (I am simply adding the BTC Yield and the BTC performance, but this would be an overestimate if MARA bought the BTC throughout the year at higher price points, which it did). The fact that the stock hasn’t moved much this year suggests that an extreme repricing could be in store. BTC and MARA YTD (Seeking Alpha) Here’s another way to see it. Anyone can clearly see that this is an operating business plus a large stash of BTC. These two components are required to get a fair value of the company. The 40,435 BTC at $96,000 per coin is $3.88 billion. MARA’s market cap right now is $7.34 billion at a $22.80 share price. This means that 53% of the company's value is BTC. For every dollar of MARA stock you buy, you are getting 53 cents of BTC. The operating business makes up the remaining 47 cents of that dollar, and it has a value of $3.46 billion. Let’s do some quick math. MARA has an average fleet efficiency of 22.7 J/Th as of Q3 . It also has 50 Eh/s as of 10 December. Miners will install the newest models, so I expect the average fleet efficiency to be slightly more efficient by 10 December (the Q3 presentation reports 40.3 Eh/s). Note that a higher fleet efficiency means a lower J/Th number. On Bitmain’s website , the S19J XP miners are 21.5 J/Th efficiency with a price per terahash of $23. Because MARA’s average fleet efficiency will be roughly 21.5 J/Th, we can assume that it is all S19j XP machines. S19j XP (Bitmain) Given these numbers, the ASICs alone required to generate 50 Eh/S is worth $1.15 billion (23 $/T x 50,000,000 T = $1.15 billion; 1 exahash is 1 million terahashes). So the operating business which is worth $3.46 billion (after we removed the BTC holdings from the MARA market cap) also contains $1.15 billion worth of machines. This isn’t even counting the fact that all the machines are currently installed and running with all the proper servicing protocols in place. It also doesn’t count the actual sites, power infrastructure, and human capital that must accompany a mining operation for the machines to generate hashrate and mine BTC. MARA has 1500 MW of available capacity and owns much of these assets outright. MARA (MARA) Is all of that worth only $2.3 billion? Let us say that it is worth $2.3 billion, despite the fact that some data center REITs with 3000 MW in total across their sites (and minimal ownership of computing machines) can trade for tens of billions of dollars. Please remember that we still haven’t even counted the future income generated by turning these machines on. 50 Eh/s is 6.5% of the Bitcoin network’s total hashrate of 765 Eh/s. Bitcoin miners collectively earn a 3.125 BTC block subsidy per block per 10 minutes (we are not even counting network transaction fees). This is 4320 blocks, 13,500 BTC per month. A 6.5% share of that is 877.5 BTC, or $84.2 million at $96,000 per coin. So $84.2 million per month is the lower bound revenue estimate. We also must remember that the mining operation isn’t even the only operating business segment. MARA sells special firmware and 2-phase immersion cooling (2PIC) technology. MARA (MARA) 2PIC has tens of millions of dollars in orders in the pipeline. 2PIC works for Bitcoin mining and for AI GPUs. This is a pure pick and shovels play on AI data centers. MARAFW, which is only for mining, also has its own paying customers. An investor is probably getting a lot of free things at the current share price and market cap. There’s a third way to see this opportunity. And it is the simplest. Amongst all the miners, MARA’s BTC holdings occupy the highest percentage of its market cap. At this point, MARA’s premium to its BTC holdings is even smaller than MicroStrategy’s premium to its own BTC holdings. And unlike MicroStrategy, MARA’s operating business has a positive income based on GAAP accounting. Here is the list of companies with Bitcoin treasuries, sorted by their BTC as a percentage of their market: Bitcoin Treasuries (Bitcointreasuries.net) When you look at it this way, MARA is literally the cheapest miner. And it is fascinating that it has the most BTC and highest BTC Yield by a long shot. Risks The main risk with MARA is that the convertible bonds strategy doesn’t work out. This can happen if there’s a prolonged pullback in MARA’s price. The bondholders will not opt to convert their bonds to shares, and MARA may be forced to sell off assets to pay the principal. It is also during such a time that refinancing the bonds could prove difficult, leaving asset sales to be the only course of action. This risk could materialize if BTC crashes. This company is of course a bet on BTC. Anyone who cannot accept that risk need not consider MARA for investment. The other key risk is that MARA still seems to be very committed to increasing hashrate. I dislike this. Mining is largely a losing game in all commodities. Gold miners don’t outperform gold and silver miners don’t outperform silver. Bitcoin is the most unforgiving and zero-sum commodity there is, thanks to its absolute scarcity and its global accessibility. Bitcoin miners have no moat in mining. Their moat is in their access to power infrastructure, which can be repurposed to serve AI use cases. Recently, we are seeing that their other moat is the volatility of their equity, which can be efficiently monetized via convertible bonds. In general, my view is that MARA can and should divest their miners over time and buy BTC with the proceeds to further increase BTC per share. Dumping the depreciating ASICs and focusing on acquiring BTC would be better for the long term. It is unlikely that any ASIC will generate more BTC over time via mining than by being sold for some BTC on the spot. Conclusion The company is executing the convertible bonds strategy with great results. Yet, the market has been seemingly unresponsive to these enormous BTC Yield numbers that MARA has been putting up. On a multiple to BTC holdings basis, MARA is the cheapest Bitcoin miner out there. A simple sum of parts analysis shows that there is a lot of value here. MARA is a Strong Buy at these levels.

Investors await market results in ‘make-or-break’ situation,"Adobe Inc. is short on time to persuade investors that it can keep up with artificial intelligence, which is running away as the next big trend in technology markets. According to a recent Bloomberg report , Adobe’s stock has fallen 8.3% this year. The company is lagging behind the broader software sector, which is up more than 30%. This has put more pressure on the results due to come out after the market closes on Wednesday after last quarter’s forecasts let investors down. Graph comparing Adobe stock price and the S&P Software Index. Source: Bloomberg Adobe will need to prove it can profit from its AI tools and fend off new competitors developing generative artificial intelligence (AGI) that can turn prompts into images and videos. Jamie Meyers, a senior analyst at Laffer Tengler Investments, says, “This is a make-or-break quarter.” He continued that investors still need to see if Adobe can make money and remain competitive in the AI race. Still, it is one of the firm’s top picks even if it’s on “probation” for its uncertain AI plans. Adobe’s AI strategy involved attracting customers rather than monetization Adobe has added its own AI technology, Firefly, to products such as Photoshop and Illustrator. However, it has not released its AI video tool as quickly as OpenAI’s Sora . Last quarter, the firm said its main focus was to get customers to use AI features rather than immediately making money from them. The firm is playing the patience card with this approach. Meyers pointed out that Adobe has spent a lot, but investors are still looking for strong returns. He says, “If the tone is negative again, it will be a while before Adobe can shake the sense it is falling behind.” Fourth quarter results are expected to show net profits greater than 13% and revenue more than 9%. However, net new recurring revenue could fall 3.1%, the first dip in a year. Adobe’s Creative Cloud area, including its AI tools, also has weak expectations from investors. Mixed sentiments about performance Tyley Radke, a Citigroup analyst, mentioned in a note that they believe the core business is losing revenue due to bad economic times and competition. Radke also cut his price target, saying Adobe might see little action once the company pulls in new AI customers instead of making a quick dime. Over the last three months, analyst forecasts for 2025 net earnings and revenue have slipped on average. The share price could rise if Adobe can ease long-term growth worries. Currently, its price-to-earnings ratio is less than 27, below its 10-year average of 32. The company’s shares are also cheaper than the software index, which trades at around 38 times earnings. Still, investors crave hard evidence that AI will work. Meyers at Laffer Tengler said that, at this point, the lower valuation makes sense since growth has slowed. “However, getting clarity and seeing tangible monetization from AI could really lead to a catch-up trade. We’re optimistic but cautious,” he added.

37511136,https://coinpedia.org/?p=392018,1733935197,Here’s When XRP Price And Other Altcoins Will Pump Again,"The post Here’s When XRP Price And Other Altcoins Will Pump Again appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP has been experiencing interesting price movements lately, with an unexpected surge in retail interest. Google Trends data shows a rise in mentions of XRP and this surge has sparked a lot of retail hype. According to Brian from Santiment , it’s fascinating how a strong 30-day performance can drive this kind of excitement. Even with a slight pullback, XRP is still up around 329% in the past month. Though it’s down about 11.5% from its recent peak about eight days ago, XRP’s price doubled in just one week, from November 25 to December 2. On the Thinking Crypto podcast, Brian said that the price surge was accompanied by a spike in transaction volume and active addresses, signaling strong retail interest. However, it’s important to know that XRP, like other altcoins, remains vulnerable to Bitcoin’s movements. Despite this, XRP’s utility has been a key driver behind the FOMO, with many traders jumping in based on price momentum rather than the coin’s fundamentals. When Will XRP and Other Altcoins Rise Again? The altcoin market has been seeing some interesting movements lately. Over the past week, the overall market cap of about 3,600 assets has dropped by around 1.5%, but trading volume has actually increased. The analyst said that right now, sentiment is mixed, with neither bulls nor bears clearly in control. This has created some volatility, where panic sellers are being met by buyers looking to take advantage of lower prices. The market is stuck with no clear direction. Many are hoping for a rally into Christmas or the new year, while others are anticipating a dip followed by a potential recovery in January. Historically, December has sometimes been a rough month for crypto markets, especially after strong performance in November. In 2017 and 2021, there were similar slowdowns in December, and this year could follow a similar pattern. Tax season often leads to profit-taking, which can further slow down activity. In the short term, it might be worth keeping an eye on how things develop. The next few weeks could be quieter as whales and large traders take a step back.",NEUTRAL,XRP,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/heres-when-xrp-price-and-other-altcoins-will-pump-again/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

42415848,a6ecdeff-34d1-4293-8a62-cee188382925,1733935122,Opening Doors for Banks Under a Trump Administration,"One of the most significant factors for the crypto industry lies not in market dynamics, but in the political arena.  Trump’s pro-crypto rhetoric certainly grabbed headlines, but the real catalyst for banks and other financial intermediaries is likely a Republican sweep in Congress, given that most of his pledges would require legislative approval. With strong Republican backing and bipartisan support also showing momentum, crypto-friendly legalisation would be far more likely to pass.  Two developments are central to this shift: dismantling the SEC’s SAB 121 (which has kept much of the financial sector sidelined) and the Bitcoin Act 2024 (which proposes a national bitcoin stockpile).  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Revocation of SAB 121  SAB 121 is a contentious accounting bulletin that has created a compliance burden, discouraging banks from offering services like crypto custody — despite the rising demand from customers (and likely from the banks themselves).  Dismantling SAB 121 would remove a major chokehold on banks, allowing them to offer crypto custody services and further diversify their product offerings into staking and other yield-bearing products. This mirrors what we have seen in the ETF market, where institutional involvement fundamentally changes market dynamics.  It would also allow banks to defend their assets under management, retain clients, and increase their share of wallet among existing clients interested in crypto, while attracting a younger generation of crypto-native customers.  This is likely the route towards mainstream adoption as banks could offer retail customers simplified or “all-in-one” financial services.  Bitcoin Act 2024  Trump also promised to push the Bitcoin Act 2024, which aims to establish a strategic bitcoin stockpile as part of U.S. Treasury reserves. Similar initiatives are already underway in Brazil, and U.S. states like Pennsylvania have already introduced their own bitcoin reserve bill.  If adopted, bitcoin’s safe haven status would be fully legitimised, and the market implications could be substantial by fundamentally changing how central banks and corporate treasurers approach their allocation strategies.  We have already seen how the involvement of TradFi heavyweights and institutional ETF flows can impact the market, and central bank purchases could amplify these effects dramatically.  Political figures like Senator Cynthia Lummis even suggest the Federal Reserve should reallocate some of its gold reserves to bitcoin, opening up the possibility of bitcoin narrowing its gap with gold’s $17.7 trillion market cap — more than 9x bitcoin’s $1.9 trillion.  Additional pledges  Trump’s broader agenda also targets the shutting down of banking restrictions tied to Operation Choke Point 2.0, a measure alleged to have debanked over 70 crypto firms, according to a16z’s Marc Andreessen.  Meanwhile, Trump’s opposition to a Fed-issued central bank digital currency (CBDC) aligns with Republican efforts to protect privacy through measures like the CBDC Anti-Surveillance Act, which would ban the Fed from using a CBDC without congressional approvals.  Whether the U.S. transitions from a regulatory laggard to a legislative leader remains to be seen. But the opportunity is clear: the U.S. is the world’s largest financial market with the potential to bring substantial change and traction to the crypto economy.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Lucas Schweiger,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/12/11/opening-doors-for-banks-under-a-trump-administration,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6e972065a5571e224e77dd77a3385d4977d843c8-4240x2832.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Friends out in the US said the tragedy rocked the country, and the whole world was moved, hoping for a solution for the citizens on the ground in NC to rise quickly. It seems that prayer was answered, with DePIN telecoms company World Mobile facilitating the rapid deployment of decentralized wireless network nodes on the ground, to restore mobile access for survivors without coverage in the wake of the destruction. How Blockchain Delivered Lifesaving Connectivity After HurricaneHelene #CryptoDaily w/ @WorldMobileTeam https://t.co/gK9v2w57xN — Mario Nawfal (@MarioNawfal) December 10, 2024 Like something out of a movie, World Mobile flew to remote areas on a helicopter provided by Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Ethereum and Cardano, to deploy its decentralized wireless nodes. The nodes, called “AirNodes”, provide cellular signal for end-users, direct-to-handset. AirNodes themselves require connection, called ‘backhaul’, which can be provided by a range of different technologies including fibre optic and satellite connectivity. In remote locations, such as those impacted by Helene in North Carolina, World Mobile AirNodes are able to connect via Starlink, converting its satellite signal into cellular coverage, giving anyone within a mile radius of the node the ability to dial out to emergency services, contact loved ones, and allowing them to connect with the world again in the aftermath of the tragedy. Micky Watkins, CEO, World Mobile Group said the following about the relief efforts: “We are committed to supporting communities when they need us the most. The rapid deployment of our DePIN network in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene demonstrates the vital role that innovative connectivity solutions can play in disaster recovery.” All of this was captured by an industry-grade film team who shadowed the World Mobile team as they deployed the nodes on the ground, and the result is worth a watch. World Mobile have teamed up with X’s biggest Spaces host, Mario Nawful, who debuted the film, titled “Connecting the Disconnected” on his page yesterday. The hope is that sharing the documentary on such a large platform will shine a light on the positive impact that Web3 can have in the field of humanitarian relief, and also to show the ease of deployment and benefit to returning ownership to the community that Web3 and DePIN offer. As per a recent press release, World Mobile’s mission is “democratizing global connectivity through its blockchain-based decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN)” - And whilst the disaster relief certainly seems like a strong use-case, World Mobile aren’t stopping there. Recently, World Mobile passed the 500,000 daily users mark, and successfully completed the first 4 of its global AirNode drops, with the latest drop selling out in under 3 minutes. With AirNode operators earning up to $1,000 per month, future sales are expected to be a resounding success. With a market size of over $1.7tn, and the quality of service for end users waning, it’s clear that the telecoms industry is due a shake up. Legacy mobile network operators are struggling to evolve in the wake of a shift toward data usage for VoIP and instant messaging, over calls and texts, and malpractice is rife, with user data selling and overcharging at record highs. World Mobile looks well placed to shake up this behemoth market by enabling users to reclaim power over their communication with a fully private, secure, community-powered service which fairly shares revenue with those using and helping to build the network, and with new use cases coming to light constantly, 2025 looks like an interesting year for World Mobile .

Crypto King Musk (MUSKKING), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKKING is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Crypto King Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crypto King Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Crypto King Musk launched with over $7,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Crypto King Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Crypto King Musk by entering its contract address – v2jWiNpR1m8gHARdM39GosZ8muaxZpowpBgWgWTSCev – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKKING.

More on Celestia and Tron’s Price Action,"What’s driving attention in the crypto world lately? Celestia’s modular blockchain approach has recently gained momentum, especially after launching its Mainnet Beta, Lemon Mint. TRON (TRX), meanwhile, continues expanding, with its user base surpassing 271 million accounts and its transaction numbers hitting new records, pushing interest in its future growth. Then there’s Web3Bay , entering the scene with a fresh take on decentralized e-commerce. Positioned to become the Amazon of blockchain, Web3Bay offers users full control and ownership in online shopping. With high ROI potential and community governance, Web3Bay stands out as a promising choice among these rising projects. Celestia: Powering Modular Blockchain with Growing Demand Celestia has quickly gained traction with its modular blockchain design, offering flexibility and scalability for various decentralized applications. The launch of its Mainnet Beta, Lemon Mint, marked a significant milestone as the first modular data availability network, creating excitement in the market. This innovative structure allows different blockchains to run side-by-side, catering to specific needs and driving up demand, leading to a Celestia price surge. Celestia’s native token, TIA, was introduced along with the mainnet, providing holders with governance rights and consensus participation. Trading at around $5.69 as of November 2024, TIA’s increasing market cap shows that interest in modular blockchain solutions is only growing. With Celestia’s efficient data storage and transaction processing, the project stands as a potential leader in transforming how blockchains can operate independently yet connect seamlessly. Tron: Scaling New Heights in User Growth and Transactions Tron has been on a steady growth path, reaching new records in user adoption and transaction volume. With over 271 million accounts and more than 50 million weekly transactions as of November 2024, Tron is positioning itself as a major player in the Web3 ecosystem. The recent 12.90% price increase in TRX reflects the growing confidence in the network’s scalability and efficiency. Beyond impressive user numbers, Tron’s focus on expanding decentralized applications and improving transaction speeds has kept it relevant. Analysts have also issued an optimistic forecast for TRX in 2025, expecting further gains as adoption rises. Tron's active ecosystem and continuous innovation make it an appealing choice for those interested in a well-established platform with ongoing development in Web3 and beyond. Web3Bay: The Decentralized E-commerce Platform with Huge Potential Web3Bay is gearing up to become a significant player in decentralized e-commerce, aiming to offer an alternative to traditional platforms like eBay. With the rise of crypto shoppers, estimated at over 400 million worldwide, Web3Bay’s marketplace could attract a sizeable portion of these users by providing a secure, user-driven environment for online transactions. Unlike centralized marketplaces, Web3Bay hands control back to users, allowing them to manage their own data and transactions with full transparency. Early investors in Web3Bay’s 3BAY token have already seen impressive returns. Those who entered at the first presale stage, when the token was priced at just $0.003, experienced an ROI of 6430% by the final presale stage price of $0.1959. Taking note of the project’s uniqueness, analysts are predicting a potential ROI of up to 40,000%. This strong early performance highlights Web3Bay’s growth potential as it nears its full launch, where more shoppers may find value in its user-friendly, decentralized approach to buying and selling. With community-driven governance, Web3Bay empowers users to shape its future, creating an engaged community that’s invested in the platform’s success. As it positions itself to compete with established e-commerce giants, Web3Bay’s combination of blockchain transparency and e-commerce functionality makes it a compelling choice for those interested in the future of online shopping powered by crypto. The Final Take With unique strengths across the board, Celestia, Tron, and Web3Bay are each carving out notable roles in the crypto space. Celestia’s modular blockchain network brings flexibility and scalability, attracting interest for its innovative approach. Tron's rapid growth in user adoption and transaction volume shows its strong presence within Web3. However, Web3Bay stands apart with its focus on decentralized e-commerce, targeting the large and growing base of crypto shoppers while delivering an impressive ROI. Positioned to rival established platforms, Web3Bay combines community-driven governance with blockchain transparency, making it an exciting choice for the future of online commerce.Join Web3Bay Presale Now: Presale: https://web3bay.io/buy Website: https://web3bay.io/ Twitter: https://x.com/web3bayofficial Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/web3bayofficial/ Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Bitcoin surpassing $100,000 may have been the champagne moment, but the digital asset class has had much to cheer about and digest since the Fed’s easing cycle began on September 18, and even more since the U.S. election.  New incoming leadership at the SEC and other regulatory agencies, blockchain-savvy cabinet appointees, a new “AI and Crypto Czar,” and frequent mentions of bitcoin and crypto by the President-elect all point towards more support for the industry from the U.S. government.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  The availability and early success of bitcoin ETF and ETF index options offer risk management tools that individuals and institutions can access through brokerage accounts. This not only invites investors with more sophisticated risk management needs, but also provides another venue for bitcoin liquidity.  Record spot and derivatives volumes on digital asset exchanges, topping $10 trillion in November, remind us that it’s not all about U.S. ETF inflows and outflows — there are giant crypto global markets out there and they like what they see.  Medium- and long-term optimism may be well-placed here, given the tailwinds of regulatory expectations (better, stronger, easier to navigate), the macroeconomic state (an easing cycle, but with the possibility of inflation), industry health (oceans of talent, global competition, a hiccup-free 2024), and green shoots of institutional adoption (over $100 billion in bitcoin and ether ETFs, MSTR’s balance sheet).  While timing — whether in markets, regulation or macro — is never easy, here are a few predictions for the months and quarters ahead in digital assets.  Prediction 1: bitcoin adoption momentum will persist  Among digital assets, bitcoin's regulatory support is the most ""complete"" today. In the United States, you can get exposure to bitcoin natively or via futures, ETFs, asset management products, or options. Bitcoin stands to gain the least from more prescriptive digital asset regulation in the U.S. However, bitcoin's adoption momentum is strong, with plenty of room to run. With a fixed ultimate supply of 21 million bitcoins, a known and hard-coded ""monetary policy,"" and a better-understood narrative and context for investment allocation, we expect more integration of bitcoin into individual, advised, and institutional portfolios. Adoption momentum will be bitcoin’s long-term price driver, with macro factors affecting short- and medium-term fluctuations. Every time we see a bitcoin-skeptical article, we know that adoption momentum will persist.  Prediction 2: lower bitcoin volatility lies ahead  The growing population of bitcoin holders and the broader array of financial instruments to provide exposure to bitcoin's price will continue to dampen bitcoin's volatility, bringing it closer, on average, to equities (or, at least some equities). Options on bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. will permit more sophisticated and accessible risk management strategies. This has two implications. First, investors with institutional-grade risk management requirements — and steadier hands — may be able to own bitcoin given the availability of options. Second, investors may use the protection properties of options to avoid selling positions in a weak market, which would otherwise exacerbate drawdowns. We also believe retail investors will sell bitcoin call options against long ETF positions, a yield strategy permitted in retirement accounts, which will depress options prices and volatility.  Prediction 3: greater sustained breadth will spotlight the “5%-er conundrum”  In the month since the U.S. election, the broad-based CoinDesk 20 Index nearly doubled, outpacing bitcoin's strong performance. The CD20/bitcoin ratio also rose sharply, reversing Ethereum and other blockchain assets sprang to life on the promise of more dedicated and usable digital asset regulation in the U.S. with the incoming administration in 2025. We expect this to continue, with CD20's exposure to top digital assets reflecting the growth-side of crypto alongside that of bitcoin’s “store of value” appeal.  This presents a conundrum for “5%-ers,” those investors who want to allocate to digital assets (beyond bitcoin) but won’t have the time to become experts in sectors, pick names, or think about timing. In traditional asset classes, this is a classic application of indexing to provide access, diversification, and automatic rebalancing. We predict (and hope!) that regulatory authorities will permit investors to avail themselves of these benefits in easy-to-access wrappers.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Andy Baehr,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/12/11/bitcoin-celebrates-a-champagne-moment-what-lies-ahead,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9657c44343d464eb162c208b5de7a190d16f6586-5887x3925.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The lack of a clear direction has divided investors, with some anticipating a breakout into uncharted territory while others brace for a potential correction. Related Reading: Solana Might Reach $295 Once It Breaks Key Supply Zone – Details CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler shared key data shedding light on Bitcoin’s current dynamics. According to Adler, the nearest support level is $94,500, representing the average purchase price for short-term holders (STH) holding coins for one week to one month. This metric underscores the importance of this level as a critical threshold for maintaining market confidence. As Bitcoin grapples with resistance at $100K, the $94.5K support will be crucial in shaping the next phase of price action. A successful defense of this level could reignite bullish momentum, while a breakdown might trigger a deeper retrace. With the broader market still indecisive, Bitcoin’s movements in the coming days will be closely watched by traders and investors seeking clarity in an uncertain environment. The battle for $100K continues, and all eyes are on whether Bitcoin can finally claim this level as solid ground. Bitcoin Demand Remains Strong Despite significant selling pressure and choppy price action, Bitcoin demand remains robust, keeping the price above crucial demand zones. Investors appear to be holding their ground, contributing to a period of consolidation as they prepare for Bitcoin’s next major move. The current sideways trend reflects market indecision, yet it underscores the resilience of Bitcoin’s price in the face of volatility. Axel Adler, a prominent CryptoQuant analyst, recently shared critical insights into Bitcoin’s support levels on X. According to Adler, the nearest support level is $94,500, which represents the average purchase price for short-term holders (STH) holding coins for one week to one month. This level has become a key threshold, providing strong demand and acting as a safety net for BTC during periods of downward pressure. Further analysis reveals that $80,800 marks the average purchase price for the broader STH cohort. This level is pivotal as it represents a deeper liquidity zone that could come into play in a more significant correction. These data points suggest that $94.5K and $80.8K will be critical to monitor in the coming days and weeks.

The stakes are high, and investors are closely monitoring these liquidity zones. BTC Finding Fuel Below $100K Bitcoin is trading at $98,000 after failing to sustain a breakout above the critical $100,000 level over the past week. Despite this, the price remains resilient, with bulls finding momentum to push BTC closer to reclaiming this psychological threshold. The market watches closely as Bitcoin consolidates, signaling preparation for its next significant move. Key resistance lies at $101,200, which analysts view as pivotal for triggering the next leg up. If Bitcoin successfully reclaims and holds above this zone, it could pave the way for a strong bullish surge, driving the price into uncharted territory. Such a move would likely attract renewed interest and capital, solidifying the current rally.

Should Bitcoin fail to break above $101,200 and lose the $94,500 support level—identified as a critical threshold by analysts—investors could see a correction phase unfold. This scenario would likely target deeper liquidity zones, such as $80,800, as potential support areas. Bitcoin’s ability to hold its ground and reclaim key levels will determine its direction in the coming days. Traders closely monitor price action for signs of strength or weakness amid growing market anticipation.

37510766,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=26253,1733934514,World Mobile Debuts New Documentary with Mario Nawful on Hurricane Helene DePIN Disaster Relief,"It still feels like yesterday, but it was just 2 months ago that the devastating hurricane Helene led to the deaths of over 230 people, and caused more than $53bn in damage to property and infrastructure in North Carolina, US. Friends out in the US said the tragedy rocked the country, and the whole world was moved, hoping for a solution for the citizens on the ground in NC to rise quickly. It seems that prayer was answered, with DePIN telecoms company World Mobile facilitating the rapid deployment of decentralized wireless network nodes on the ground, to restore mobile access for survivors without coverage in the wake of the destruction. How Blockchain Delivered Lifesaving Connectivity After HurricaneHelene #CryptoDaily w/ @WorldMobileTeam https://t.co/gK9v2w57xN — Mario Nawfal (@MarioNawfal) December 10, 2024 Like something out of a movie, World Mobile flew to remote areas on a helicopter provided by Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Ethereum and Cardano, to deploy its decentralized wireless nodes. The nodes, called “AirNodes”, provide cellular signal for end-users, direct-to-handset. AirNodes themselves require connection, called ‘backhaul’, which can be provided by a range of different technologies including fibre optic and satellite connectivity. In remote locations, such as those impacted by Helene in North Carolina, World Mobile AirNodes are able to connect via Starlink, converting its satellite signal into cellular coverage, giving anyone within a mile radius of the node the ability to dial out to emergency services, contact loved ones, and allowing them to connect with the world again in the aftermath of the tragedy. Micky Watkins, CEO, World Mobile Group said the following about the relief efforts: “We are committed to supporting communities when they need us the most. The rapid deployment of our DePIN network in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene demonstrates the vital role that innovative connectivity solutions can play in disaster recovery.” All of this was captured by an industry-grade film team who shadowed the World Mobile team as they deployed the nodes on the ground, and the result is worth a watch. World Mobile have teamed up with X’s biggest Spaces host, Mario Nawful, who debuted the film, titled “Connecting the Disconnected” on his page yesterday. The hope is that sharing the documentary on such a large platform will shine a light on the positive impact that Web3 can have in the field of humanitarian relief, and also to show the ease of deployment and benefit to returning ownership to the community that Web3 and DePIN offer. As per a recent press release, World Mobile’s mission is “democratizing global connectivity through its blockchain-based decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN)” – And whilst the disaster relief certainly seems like a strong use-case, World Mobile aren’t stopping there. Recently, World Mobile passed the 500,000 daily users mark, and successfully completed the first 4 of its global AirNode drops, with the latest drop selling out in under 3 minutes. With AirNode operators earning up to $1,000 per month, future sales are expected to be a resounding success. With a market size of over $1.7tn, and the quality of service for end users waning, it’s clear that the telecoms industry is due a shake up. Legacy mobile network operators are struggling to evolve in the wake of a shift toward data usage for VoIP and instant messaging, over calls and texts, and malpractice is rife, with user data selling and overcharging at record highs. World Mobile looks well placed to shake up this behemoth market by enabling users to reclaim power over their communication with a fully private, secure, community-powered service which fairly shares revenue with those using and helping to build the network, and with new use cases coming to light constantly, 2025 looks like an interesting year for World Mobile .",POSITIVE,없음,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | SPONSORED,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/world-mobile-debuts-new-documentary-with-mario-nawful-on-hurricane-helene-depin-disaster-relief/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

From a market valued at $2.25 billion in 2023, the global Web3 sector is projected to grow at an astonishing compound annual rate of up to 51.4%, potentially surpassing $5 billion by 2030. It’s against this booming backdrop that Web3Bay stands out as a platform with the potential to lead a decentralized, user-driven shift in the e-commerce landscape. By merging the transparency and security of blockchain technology with user-friendly payment options, Web3Bay has crafted an ecosystem designed to redefine how we buy and sell online. Leading with Decentralization and User Control Web3Bay’s decentralized model tackles critical pain points in traditional e-commerce, where centralized control leads to issues of data privacy, high fees, and restricted access for global transactions. Built on a Layer-1 blockchain, Web3Bay allows users to transact securely and privately. This means no more intermediaries and hidden fees—only direct, peer-to-peer transactions. Leveraging blockchain’s transparency and security, the platform also integrates popular Web2 payment options, including PayPal, bridging familiar conveniences with the advantages of Web3. For users who value privacy and autonomy, Web3Bay offers a significant edge. 3BAY Token: Fueling Growth with Rewards and Governance Web3Bay’s native currency, the 3BAY token, is the platform's beating heart. Designed for more than just transactions, 3BAY incentivizes engagement, rewards participation, and grants governance rights. The structured, multi-stage presale is now live and illustrates Web3Bay’s strategy to reward early adopters and build a solid funding base: starting at $0.003 in Stage 1 and climbing in 15% increments through each of the 28 stages, the token price will reach $0.1959 by the final presale round. The cumulative price increase offers early participants immediate value appreciation, generating $1.43 million by Stage 28 and setting a robust market entry for Web3Bay. In all, 2 billion of the 5 billion total tokens are reserved for this presale. Beyond its function as a payment medium with a 5% discount on Web3Bay transactions, the 3BAY token also serves as a governance tool, enabling users to have a voice in the platform’s direction. In a nod to full decentralization, Web3Bay plans to eventually transition to a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), placing decision-making power into the hands of token holders. The platform is committed to community-driven progress, empowering users to vote on changes to fee structures, partnerships, and even new integrations. Scaling Innovation with a Future-Ready Roadmap Web3Bay’s growth doesn’t stop with the marketplace. Its roadmap outlines an ambitious vision for the platform, which will evolve in three main phases. Following the multi-stage presale and foundational architecture setup in Phase 1, Phase 2 will see the full launch of the marketplace, enabling users to list, buy, and sell items using cryptocurrency. Liquidity pools will also be activated to support stable trading of the 3BAY token. Phase 3 focuses on expanding Web3Bay’s ecosystem by integrating mainstream payment methods like Google Pay and Apple Pay, appealing to an even broader audience. At this stage, the platform will roll out staking for 3BAY holders and finalize the community governance structure, letting users steer the platform's future. And Web3Bay’s roadmap doesn’t stop there—NFT and DeFi integrations are in the pipeline, with plans for an NFT marketplace where users can tokenize assets and a DeFi suite offering staking, lending, and borrowing for 3BAY token holders. These cross-chain integrations will broaden Web3Bay’s appeal across blockchain ecosystems, bringing new liquidity and increasing the token’s utility. A Future Giant in Web3 E-Commerce Web3Bay’s careful blend of Web3 innovation and Web2 accessibility places it at the forefront of the Web3 e-commerce revolution. With its solid technical foundation, strong token model, and inclusive approach to payments, the platform offers a future-ready solution that could well set new standards in digital commerce. The decentralized architecture ensures data integrity and security, while the Layer-2 scaling solutions will handle high transaction volumes, providing seamless experiences even during peak periods. The Web3 e-commerce market’s trajectory points to enormous potential, and Web3Bay is positioned to capitalize on this growth. Its 3BAY token, community-driven governance, and versatile roadmap create a compelling case for Web3Bay as a top player in this next-generation commerce space. For investors and users alike, Web3Bay offers a chance to participate in a platform that not only rides the Web3 wave but also actively shapes the future of digital transactions in a rapidly expanding market. As the market matures, Web3Bay may very well become a household name—a decentralized powerhouse driving e-commerce into an era of transparency, user control, and unprecedented growth.

Travala , a web3 traveling platform that has been in existence since 2017 has for the first time surpassed the $100 million mark in annual gross revenue. Through this milestone, Travala has set itself on the front foot of ascertaining its dominance as one of the largest online travel agencies (OTA) globally as it blends the old traditional traveling solutions with the new blockchain-powered ones. The growth to $100 million is greatly attributed to the innovations and strategic partnerships that utilize both the conventional fiat together with cryptocurrencies when it comes to making travel bookings. On the partnerships, the two outstanding ones that Travala has entered into with Skyscanner and KAYAK have undoubtedly played a role in this growth together with Travala’s offering of Bitcoin (BTC) rewards for bookings. In addition to these, the bullish sentiments that are being witnessed in the broader crypto market went a long way in fueling Travala’s demand when it comes to booking flights and hotels. Coinciding with this revenue milestone is Travala’s launch of a Treasury Reserve Plan that has been designed to secure its financial position while at the same time supporting its growth. In light of this, Travala has made the decision to allocate a portion of its treasury to Bitcoin and some of it to AVA – a token that is central to its AVA smart program. Through this loyalty initiative which was developed in collaboration with the AVA Foundation, the users will be in a position to earn and redeem rewards in digital currencies, which are pivotal to Travala’s business model. As for the rewards, they will be distributed based on membership tiers. By leveraging BTC and AVA, the company is delivering on its commitment geared towards incorporating blockchain technology and innovation into the travel sector which is currently worth $10 trillion to make it grow even more. Commenting on the development, Juan Otero, CEO of Travala, stated, “Surpassing $100 million in gross revenue is a huge milestone, but for us, it’s just the beginning. With our new Treasury Reserve Plan, which includes BTC and AVA, we’re not only fueling future growth but also doubling down on our commitment to shaping the next era of travel. These assets are at the heart of the Travala product—from how users book travel to the rewards they receive—and will assist us in harnessing myriad opportunities to further innovate at the intersection of blockchain and travel as new advancements take place in the Web3 world.” With its wide network that goes well into over 230 countries, offering over 400,000 activities, and connections to more than 600 airlines globally, Travala has always been at the forefront of championing the adoption of cryptocurrencies and so, by accepting over 100+ cryptocurrencies and fiat alike, Travala is doing wonders that will redefine the travel industry.

Donald Trump was re-elected as president. During his campaign, the president-elect announced his commitment to making the United States the ‘cryptocurrency capital of the world’ and stated that he would establish a national Bitcoin reserve. Currently, the “Trump effect” has pushed Bitcoin to become the eighth largest asset in the world, surpassing silver.This has sparked discussions about his ambitious plan to create a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and has prompted people to reconsider how digital assets are held and invested.

Currently, Solana is exhibiting a ‘cup and handle’ pattern —a historically bullish setup that often signals price breakouts, according to an analysis by prominent cryptocurrency on-chain analyst Ali Martinez shared in an X post on December 11. This pattern indicates accumulation, with the rounded cup base reflecting consolidation as selling pressure eases and bullish momentum builds. For Solana, this base formed between late 2022 and early 2024, marking a period of recovery and strength. The handle, characterized by a shorter-term pullback, aligns with Solana’s recent price movements, consolidating around the $250 resistance level. SOL price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/Ali_charts According to Martinez, the potential breakout sets the next target at around $4,000—a record high. The 1.618 Fibonacci extension supports this outlook, pointing to $2,236, while the 1.786 extension aligns closely with the $4,000 target. Solana’s holding above the 0.786 retracement level of $123.44 also reinforces its underlying bullish momentum. However, the market expert did not provide timelines for when these price targets might be achieved. By any measure, Solana reaching $4,000 is an ambitious target that would elevate SOL’s market cap to nearly $2 trillion. To put this into perspective, it would place SOL on par with Bitcoin ( BTC ) if the maiden cryptocurrency experienced minimal growth. SOL’s hits double bottom Meanwhile, Solana has faced bearish sentiments in the short term, aligning with the general market momentum. However, as noted by trading analyst CryptoBusy on December 11, SOL might have overcome this bearish momentum after forming a double-bottom pattern in the one-hour timeframe. This bullish reversal pattern suggests a possible breakout could be imminent. SOL price analysis chart. Source: TradingView If bullish momentum continues, the next targets for SOL are the 0.5 Fibonacci level ($225) and the 0.618 level ($230). A measured move from the breakout point could potentially add $10 (4.56%) to the price. Solana’s potential breakout is further supported by on-chain metrics indicating increasing investor interest. For example, data from cryptocurrency intelligence platform DeFiLlama shows Solana’s daily trading volume surged from $2.92 billion on Saturday to $5.99 billion by Wednesday—the highest since November 20. Generally, such a spike reflects growing liquidity on the network alongside increasing investor interest. Solana trading volume. Source: DeFiLlama On the other hand, regulatory developments surrounding Solana could also influence the asset’s price. The Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) is highly anticipated to approve a Solana exchange-traded fund ( ETF ). Notably, outgoing SEC Chair Gary Gensler has reportedly rejected the Solana ETF, questioning the cryptocurrency’s status as a security. Interestingly, the Solana community remains optimistic that the product will gain approval under the upcoming Donald Trump administration if crypto-friendly Paul Atkins is appointed to lead the SEC. SOL price analysis At press time, Solana was trading at $225.60, with daily gains of over 5%. However, SOL is down by nearly 3% on the weekly chart. SOL price analysis chart. Source: Finbold As Solana recovers from its recent short-term dip, there are bullish signals for both the short and long-term, such as SOL trading above the 50-day ($208.78) and 200-day ($166.37) simple moving averages. With a 14-day relative strength index of 45.25 and moderate volatility at 5.47%, Solana has room for growth without entering overbought conditions, giving the asset a strong chance to end an impressive 2024 on a high.

37512626,https://cryptonews.com/?p=318719,1733933918,"Roger Ver: US Intelligence “Hijacked” Bitcoin, Turned It Into “Financial Trap”","Bitcoin.com founder Roger Ver , widely known as “Bitcoin Jesus,” has criticized how Bitcoin ( BTC ) has been turned into a speculative asset. According to Ver, early hopes for the leading cryptocurrency as an alternative to fiat currency were undermined by a combination of intelligence agencies and institutional players. Bitcoin: From P2P Freedom to Financial Surveillance? In his interview with Tucker Carlson , published on Dec. 10, Roger Ver said that US intelligence agencies deliberately undermined Bitcoin’s potential as a widespread peer-to-peer (P2P) payment method. According to Ver, they manipulated online forums like bitcointalk.org and the Bitcoin subreddit r/bitcoin through censorship and propaganda to steer it away from its decentralized origins. Moderators associated with US intelligence agencies sought to suppress discussions about scaling Bitcoin for use on a global level, Ver said, pushing it towards becoming a speculative asset instead. This was a coordinated effort to control and limit Bitcoin’s potential to disrupt traditional financial systems, according to Ver. When asked by Carlson if he believed Bitcoin was a creation of US intelligence agencies, Ver said that while it may not have been originally designed as such, it was “hijacked” and turned into a “financial trap” by those agencies. “I’m Embarrassed To Promote Bitcoin to People” According to Ver, Bitcoin is not about economic freedom, especially when Bitcoin is held on centralized exchanges (CEXs), which Ver believes provide even less privacy than traditional banks. “I’m embarrassed to promote Bitcoin to people today because the transactions are slow, expensive, unreliable, and you have no privacy. People are claiming that Bitcoin is freedom money, but I’m really afraid that they’re literally building the financial prison walls around themselves.” He pointed to El Salvador as an example, noting that while there was widespread enthusiasm for Bitcoin, people were primarily using custodial accounts. This meant the government could monitor every transaction and freeze accounts at will. “This is the exact opposite of economic freedom. It’s economic government control,” Ver said. In the interview with Carlson, Ver advocated for privacy-focused coins like Monero or Zcash as well as Zano, which Layer-1 allows users to create their own private tokens. He also mentioned Confidential Layer, a project that bridges Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ), and Ether ( ETH ) with Zano. Roger Ver (right) interviewed by Tucker Carlson (left). Source: The Tucker Carlson Show Ver believes that by enabling financial autonomy, these tools limit government overreach and the funding of war or violence. He acknowledges the risk of facing trumped up charges, but remains defiant in promoting financial freedom, adding: “I’m not against the US dollar or the yen or the euro. I think people should be able to choose what form of money they want to use. Whether it’s the dollar, the euro, the yen, or Bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency out there.” Roger Ver Faces Extradition and 109 Years in Prison Roger Ver could face 109 years in prison . US authorities are seeking his extradition from Spain on charges of tax evasion, which Ver denied in the interview. Roger Ver is facing life in prison for revealing how the US government worked secretly to subvert cryptocurrency and prevent economic freedom. More people should hear this story. (0:00) Roger Ver Facing Extradition (7:49) The Hijacking of Bitcoin (12:18) How the Government… pic.twitter.com/nchtsmsovn — Tucker Carlson (@TuckerCarlson) December 10, 2024 Ver renounced his US citizenship in 2014, becoming a citizen of Saint Kitts and Nevis. He said that he adhered to his tax obligations with the guidance of legal counsel and was not a US citizen during the period in question. The US Department of Justice (DOJ) accuses Roger Ver of failing to report substantial capital gains from Bitcoin sales and undervaluing two companies when he renounced his US citizenship in 2014. Prosecutors claim Ver hid 131,000 Bitcoins, sold in 2017 for approximately $240 million, resulting in $48 million of unpaid taxes. Ver’s defense argues that the DOJ’s claims are based on outdated information and unclear cryptocurrency tax laws at the time. US prosecutors improperly used confidential communications and violated his legal rights, Ver said, adding: “They’re not really angry about taxes at all. I think they’re just angry about my lack of obedience and lack of kissing that ring. I was the first person in the entire world to start investing in the Bitcoin ecosystem and investing in businesses that made it easy for people to use Bitcoin as money and as cash for people all over the world.” Call for a Pardon: Ver Appeals to Biden and Trump Despite the possibility of life imprisonment, the Bitcoin evangelist remains optimistic. He hopes that the Spanish court will reject the US extradition request. According to Ver, there are many ways to stop this persecution, but the most effective is to allow the public to speak out. He noted that his supporters have created the website freerogernow.org, which hosts a petition to dismiss the US claims. Ver added that the current US President Joe Biden recently pardoned his own son, so he could issue a preemptive pardon to Ver himself: “President Biden can do the right thing. He just recently pardoned his own son. He can issue a preemptive pardon for me.

37510591,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=626024,1733933804,Aptos turned into one of the most successful L1 with 1800% growth,"Aptos is one of the chains that has seen its fortune change the most in 2024 as it has made the best of the bull market. Just as L1 tokens and platforms were slowing down, Aptos managed to draw in all the elements it needed to become a growth leader. It is one of the chains that has seen its influence grow the most in 2024, making the best of the bull market. Despite the primacy of Ethereum and Solana as L1 chains, Aptos rode the trend for alternative liquidity venues. Aptos made most of its gains in the second year after its launch, after remaining relatively obscure thanks to the 2023 bear market. APT tokens had several rallies in 2024, peaking under $20. APT traded at $12.03 after its latest run in the past month. The chain is charting its own path in the non-EVM compatible markets, which makes liquidity a little harder to raise. EVM-based or compatible chains have easier access to stablecoins, in addition to wrapped ETH or ERC-20 tokens. Aptos gets a boost with native USDT liquidity Aptos is one of the chains added to Tether Inc.’s list for native USDT, although some of the tokens were authorized to go back to their Ethereum version in the past few months. As of December 2024, it carried more than $323M in stablecoins, surpassing SUI with $313M . The native USDT is also supported by around $130M in bridged USDC. In addition to using USDT for DeFi deposits and trading, Binance has also added wallets for Aptos-based stablecoins. After a long wait, the the chain’s version went live on Binance as of December 11. 🚨 The wait is over. Support for native USDT on Aptos is now LIVE on @binance . Accelerate on-chain with deposits and withdrawals now open! ⚡ pic.twitter.com/PEcEgj961v — Aptos (@Aptos) December 11, 2024 Aptos increased its total value locked by more than 1,800% in the year to date. Based on DeFi Llama data, the L1 chain now carries $1.31B in total value locked across its protocols. The chain expanded quickly by tapping successful DeFi protocols and onboarding stablecoins, the most important source of liquidity. Bridging activity was also one of the main sources of liquidity growth. Over time, the chain bridged a total of $6.69B in value, with $3B in the year to date. The past 30 days led to $3M in additional bridged assets. Other signs of growth include the gradual increase in fees raised by the protocol. For now, Aptos is still in the early stage where the chain subsidizes growth, which means the platform is operating at a loss. Aptos has one of the highest expense-to-revenue ratios , surpassing all other L1s. The chain is also still going through new APT token releases, as only 42.86% of the supply has been released for circulation. Boosted by valuable apps and TradFi tokenization efforts Despite this, incentives on Aptos are enough to keep validators and keep fees relatively low. For users, this has resulted in a new record of 1.2M daily active users, with a baseline rate of around 700K daily active wallets , close to the levels on Ethereum. Aptos already carried more than 9M monthly active users, while handling 2B transactions to date. The chain is now dependent on the success of its apps to draw in liquidity. The chain will carry Echo, its chief app for tokenizing Bitcoin (BTC) in a compatible token for Aptos. Echo has grown its TVL rapidly in the past quarter, with over $250M in liquidity. The project attracted more than 2,400 BTC locked on the Aptos chain, sparking a new source of borrowing liquidity. Other large-scale DeFi apps include Thala Labs, the chief source of liquidity and DEX trades. Thala Labs also produces $3B in volumes, while drawing in $150M in additional liquidity for the L1 chain. Kana Labs has added another $4B in trading activity, while locking in another $191M in its DeFi suite. Other sources of growth for Aptos are tests and tokenization coming from TradFi clients. Franklin Templeton and BlackRock have adopted the chain for tokenization tests, while Bitwise has launched its own Aptos Staking ETP. Beyond its more serious DeFi and TradFi features, Aptos also added a user-generated token market. The Emojicoin platform, where users mint emojis and trade them similar to Pump.fun, achieved $1M in value since November 20, launching 1,933 new assets.

37510379,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=103551,1733933507,"Here Are New Timelines for Shiba Inu to Surge to $0.0001, $0.001, and $0.01, As SHIB Rises 133%,","With Shiba Inu soaring by over 130% in three months, we’ve compiled new timelines for SHIB’s surge to $0.0001, $0.001, and $0.01. Shiba Inu (SHIB) has had an impressive performance since it plunged to around $0.000013 in early August. Recall that crypto prices tanked heavily in August due to rising geopolitical tension in the Middle East. As reported earlier, Shiba Inu was not spared in the bloodbath as it plunged below the $0.000013 price mark. Here’s When SHIB Will Hit $0.0001, $0.001, and $0.01 Interestingly, this collapse has become a thing of the past, following SHIB’s 133.15% surge to $0.00003031 in early November. This movement has affected the timelines set for Shiba Inu’s potential rally to $0.0001, $0.001, and $0.01. Consequently, The Crypto Basic consulted multiple entities, such as Changelly and ChatGPT, to ascertain when SHIB could reach these targets. Shiba Inu Potential Rally to $0.0001 $0.0001 is modest among the aforementioned targets, as it requires SHIB to surge 266.97% from its current price. This target is 13.05% higher than Shiba Inu’s previous all-time high (ATH) of $0.00008845, set on October 28, 2021. At $0.0001, Shiba Inu’s market cap would rise to $58.92 billion from the current value of $16.04 billion. This estimation assumes that Shiba Inu’s circulating supply of 589.25 trillion tokens remains fairly stable. According to Changelly experts, Shiba Inu will hit the $0.0001 target by 2027, three years from now. In 2027, the experts expect SHIB to trade at a minimum target of $0.000103, an average price of $0.000107, and a maximum price of $0.000127. ChatGPT, a popular AI chatbot, issued three timelines for SHIB’s surge to $0.0001. First, it expects SHIB to hit the target between 2025 and 2026, noting that the milestone would be driven by widespread adoption, hefty token burns, and a strong bull market. The second timeline would see SHIB clinch $0.0001 in 2 - 4 years, specifically between 2026 and 2028. Achieving the target within this timeline requires SHIB to witness increased utility through Shiba Inu’s L2 blockchain Shibarium and steady economic growth. Lastly, ChatGPT sees the $0.0001 target becoming a reality by 2029 or beyond due to a lack of solid adoption. Shiba Inu to $0.001 Hitting the $0.001 target requires a rise of 3,559% from the current price. Upon clinching this target, Shiba Inu’s market cap would soar to $589.25 billion from the current value, assuming the circulating supply remains fairly stable. Experts at Changelly see the $0.001 target becoming a reality by 2033, which would mark SHIB’s maximum price by then. In addition, ChatGPT issued its prediction for Shiba Inu’s potential surge to $0.001 under three different timelines. The outlooks are optimistic, moderate, and pessimistic. For the optimistic forecast, ChatGPT expects SHIB to clinch $0.001 between 2030 and 2034. This rise will be driven by several factors, ranging from massive token burns to rapid institutional interest in SHIB. The moderate forecast estimates that SHIB would trade at $0.001 between 2035 and 2040, highlighting factors like long-term growth in adoption as a potential driver. The pessimistic outlook does not expect Shiba Inu to reach this target without aggressive burns. Hence, ChatGPT did not set a particular timeline for this scenario. Shiba Inu to $0.01 Amid Shiba Inu’s 133.51% surge, we consulted Changelly and ChatGPT to find out the updated timeline for SHIB’s rally to the one-cent ($0.01) dream. With Shiba Inu currently trading at $0.2725, the token must register a surge of 36,597% to reach the $0.01 target . At this price, Shiba Inu’s market cap would climb to an astounding $5.89 trillion, surpassing Bitcoin’s current valuation. Despite the massive growth rate required for Shiba Inu to surge to $0.01, Changelly experts believe the one-cent dream is realistic for SHIB. According to them, Shiba Inu would likely hit the target by October 2040, marking SHIB’s maximum price by then. Furthermore, ChatGPT set an optimistic timeline of 2035 - 2045 for Shiba Inu’s potential surge to $0.01. It speculated that SHIB could achieve the one-cent dream within this period by incinerating 95-99% of the circulating supply. For the moderate and pessimistic outlooks, ChatGPT does not see Shiba Inu soaring to $0.01 over the next few decades. While the $0.0001 target is moderate, Shiba Inu’s potential surge to $0.001 and $0.01 seems audacious, as it requires the asset to surge by thousands of percentages. Achieving these milestones within a short period would necessitate the alignment of several factors, ranging from strong institutional demand to massive burn.",POSITIVE,SHIB,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/11/here-are-new-timelines-for-shiba-inu-to-surge-to-0-0001-0-001-and-0-01-as-shib-rises-133/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=here-are-new-timelines-for-shiba-inu-to-surge-to-0-0001-0-001-and-0-01-as-shib-rises-133,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Notably, top cryptocurrencies like Near protocol (NEAR) and Litecoin (LTC) have made quite some progress in the past month with both registering over 60% price surge. However, established altcoins are not the only beneficiary of the current bull market as there has been a growing interest in the presale market. Specifically, fast-rising presale stars like Lunex network (LNEX) have gained recognition for their innovation and rapid adoption. With nearly $5M raised so far, Lunex Network has been projected to complete a 100x price rally during this bull cycle. Lunex Network’s Rapid Presale Progress Attracts Growing Interests Given its rapid progression in the presale market, Lunex Network (LNEX) has become a centre of attraction for many crypto investors. However, more importantly, Lunex network is gaining recognition because of its innovative DeFi iteration that streamlines the transaction processes involved in cross-chain crypto transactions. Essentially, the DeFi platform allows users to swap and transfer over 50K crypto assets in a single process. Beyond the ease of transaction, Lunex Network ensures that users do not require any KYC nor third-party wallets, thus enhancing both security and convenience for all users. Moreso, the DeFi protocol adopts a revenue-sharing mechanism that allocates a portion of the platform’s revenue to active community members and token holders. Furthermore, Lunex Network aims to revolutionize the DeFi market by providing RPC nodes for Web3 development. This distinct innovation, coupled with its institutional-grade B2B merchant payment gateway and portfolio tracking features has bolstered investor confidence in its ability to actually rally 100x this bull run. Currently, $LNEX, Lunex Network’s native token is currently selling at $0.0038 per token, with projection to reach $0.50 this bull cycle. Near Protocol Attempts to Stabilize Above $8 Amid Price Rally Near Protocol (NEAR) ranks among the list of top crypto gainers during this bull cycle, having surged from a monthly entry price of $4.3 to briefly trade above the $8 price mark. Although, NEAR token is now trading slightly below this mark with a weekly price range of $6.6 and $7.1, it has made a significant move to the upside in the past month. While it attempts to stabilize above the resistance level at $8, Near protocol’s technical analysis suggests that the recent retracement is a minor setback. Notably, NEAR token’s moving averages , including its 20, 100, and 200 SMA and EMAs signals a strong buy which ultimately suggests a sustained bull momentum. As a result, NEAR price is projected to soon surpass its previous year-to-date high of $8.8 and possibly revisit the all-time high price of $20.4. Litecoin Registers Yearly ATH, Maintains Bullish Momentum Like Near protocol, Litecoin (LTC) has also recorded quite an impressive price movement in the past month, registering about a 70% increase in the past month. While the recent surge contributed significantly to LTC token’s year-to-date price recovery, it also pushed it to register a new YTD ATH around $144. Currently trading within a weekly price range of $119 and $125, Litecoin price reflects slightly above nearly 2% increase, a modest increase compared to the previous week. Meanwhile, the recent price surge has further bolstered investors’ confidence as 85% of over 23K Coinmarketcap community members voted in favor of a bullish price trajectory. This positive sentiment, coupled with bullish technical metrics including 50, 100, and 200 EMA and SMAs points at a sustained momentum. If that be the case, LTC price could push above the next resistance level around $257, and eventually surpass its ATH price of $412 in the near future. Can Lunex Network Outpace Litecoin and Near Protocol? Both Litecoin and Near Protocol have had a fair run during the ongoing bull market. However, with projections for a sustained bullish momentum, these top altcoins are expected to perform even better in the coming weeks, potentially securing more gains for token holders. While this is not only true for established altcoins alone, fast-rising presale stars like Lunex network have also been tipped for enormous price rally. Besides its ICO status which makes it a more stable choice for long term investors, Lunex Network’s institutional features also positions it as a major contender during this bull cycle.

Ethereum (ETH), Binance’s BNB, and BlockDAG (BDAG) are grabbing attention with their advanced technology, strong ecosystems, and innovative strategies. From cutting-edge blockchain frameworks to unmatched utility in decentralized finance, these coins have what it takes to lead the charge. What makes them the best altcoins for the next bull run? Read on to uncover their game-changing potential. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Redefining Layer-1 Blockchain with 2240% Growth BlockDAG (BDAG) is a powerful layer-1 blockchain redefining what’s possible in the crypto space. Built on DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) technology, it delivers unparalleled scalability and security, making it an ideal foundation for decentralized applications. Positioned as one of the best altcoins for the next bull run, BlockDAG stands apart with its Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, enabling seamless integration with existing tools and projects. Additionally, its low-code/no-code development platform empowers businesses and developers to create utility tokens, NFTs, and dApps with ease, making blockchain technology more accessible than ever. At the heart of this project is its native coin, BDAG, which is currently available during its coin presale phase. Crypto enthusiasts are taking advantage of the rare opportunity to accumulate BDAG at an early stage, with the presale already raising $160 million and selling over 17 billion coins. The coin’s price has surged from $0.001 in batch 1 to $0.0234 in batch 26—a 2240% increase—showcasing BlockDAG’s remarkable growth. Analysts even predict BDAG could deliver up to 20,000X returns to early holders, placing it firmly among the top altcoins for the next bull run. With its advanced technology, accessible tools, and growing momentum, BDAG is a promising choice for those looking to capitalize on the next market surge. 2. Ethereum (ETH): Positioned for a Breakout to New Highs Ethereum (ETH) is on the verge of a major breakout, with analysts closely watching its progress toward surpassing its previous all-time high of $4,800. Despite trailing Bitcoin’s recent performance, Ethereum remains the backbone of the decentralized application (DApp) ecosystem, powering over 64% of DApps and hosting a Total Value Locked (TVL) of $159 billion. Institutional interest in ETH is growing, evidenced by a significant net inflow into spot ETFs, signaling confidence in its long-term potential. Technical analysts highlight a promising cup-and-handle pattern forming since 2021, suggesting ETH could surge past $3,800 and potentially hit $7,200. As one of the top altcoins for the next bull run, Ethereum’s bullish momentum is building, with only $100 left to breach a critical resistance level as 2025 approaches. 3. BNB (BNB): The Resilient Powerhouse of Binance BNB (BNB), the utility token of Binance, continues to demonstrate its resilience and potential as one of the top altcoins for the next bull run. Starting as a presale at just $0.15, BNB has evolved into a cornerstone of the crypto market. It powers the Binance Smart Chain as a gas token and offers discounts on Binance’s centralized exchange, ensuring its widespread use. Its deflationary tokenomics, featuring a robust buy-back and burn mechanism, maintains upward price pressure. Despite regulatory challenges, Binance has regained momentum under new leadership, with renewed optimism fueled by pro-crypto policies. As DeFi adoption grows and trading volumes increase, BNB is positioned to break through previous highs, solidifying its status as a top contender for 2025 gains. Wrapping Up ETH powers over 64% of decentralized applications and boasts a massive $159 billion in Total Value Locked, cementing its position as a cornerstone of blockchain technology. Similarly, BNB continues to thrive with its dual role as a gas token for the Binance Smart Chain and its deflationary tokenomics driving demand. However, BlockDAG takes the top spot on this list. With its advanced DAG technology, EVM compatibility, and low-code/no-code platform, it’s not just another blockchain—it’s the future of scalable, accessible innovation. With plans to dominate decentralized application growth, BDAG’s presale highlights its momentum, and analysts predict up to 20,000X returns, making it the best altcoin for the next bull run.

37510097,https://finbold.com/?p=218800,1733933069,"Two cryptocurrencies to turn $100 into $1,000 in 2025","As it turned out by December, the trick to making it big in the 2024 cryptocurrency market was no tougher than buying all but the shadiest of meme coins and tokens as the year featured a massive bull run. Such a setup, for all the optimism, might make finding the right digital assets to invest in in 2025 tougher as across-the-board higher prices indicate that – barring a true parabolic market-wide rally – many cryptocurrencies are likely to offer far more modest gains. Still, many will likely continue surging, with even the biggest names in the sector, such as Bitcoin ( BTC ) and XRP , likely generating millionaires, particularly should they hit some of their most bullish price targets of $250,000 and $48 , respectively. Assuming 2025 proves another strong year, however, savvy investors might find even more wealth trading some of the slightly more overlooked digital assets, and Finbold elected to examine two strong trades for the New Year. Hedera (HBAR) Hedera ( HBAR ), the token of a platform focused on providing somewhat unconventional solutions to the issues of blockchain transaction speed, security, and scalability using the ‘ Hashgraph’ consensus algorithm, had recorded massive gains since early November. The surge, though on a hiatus at press time, is likely to continue into 2025 due to numerous recent positive developments, including Canary Capital’s November filing for a spot exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) and an active role in real-world asset tokenization. The ETF could prove a particularly powerful catalyst, as the mere act of filing raised the cryptocurrency’s prominence, and recent electoral and regulatory developments indicate approval is relatively likely to come next year. Furthermore, HBAR’s recent performance – a 20.74% correction from the December 6 highs near $0.37 to the press time price of $0.29 – that followed an extraordinarily 433.91% rise in the last 30 days demonstrates both the token’s rally potential and the fact traders are likely, at press time, facing a ‘buy the dip’ opportunity making it easier to turn $100 into $1,000. HBAR 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold Stellar (XLM) Stellar ( XLM ) has been in the news more and more in recent weeks for a good reason: its swings are remarkably similar yet stronger than those of XRP. Specifically, XLM first experienced a 500.84% rally between early November and December, taking it from $0.09307 to $0.5592. Within the same time frame, XRP rocketed 346.27% from $0.51314 to $2.29. Furthermore, the subsequent correction has also been greater as Stellar dropped 10.43% in the last 7 days to its press time price of $0.43188, while XRP’s downturn amounted to 4.33%. XLM 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold Much like HBAR, investors seeking to enter an XLM position may have a great opportunity on December 11 as the recent downturn not only means the cryptocurrency is relatively cheap compared to recent highs but has significantly cooled off its relative strength index ( RSI ), from ‘overbought’ peaks above 90 to 53.68. Also similar to Hedera, Stellar is benefitting from increased institutional exposure through Grayscale Investments LLC’s Stellar Lumens Trust – a tailwind that has been strong in late 2024 and is likely to grow stronger in 2025 given the general trend toward greater digital assets acceptance and adoption. Finally, should XLM continue outperforming XRP by a similar margin – and should XRP reach the most bullish of expert expectations – a rally all the way up to $9 could illuminate the token in 2025.

Alchemy Pay ( ACH ) notes that the layer-1 blockchain will be dubbed Alchemy Chain and built on the Solana (SOL) Virtual Machine architecture. Per an announcement on Dec. 11, the new L1 will offer a payment system allowing users to transact with fiat and crypto. The platform will also offer a user-friendly ecosystem bridging on-chain and off-chain processes, chain abstraction, a stablecoin revenue mechanism, and yield generation.

Another State Takes Action on Bitcoin (BTC) Reserves!,"As we wonder whether Donald Trump will deliver on his promise of a strategic Bitcoin (BTC) reserve for the United States, the idea of adopting Bitcoin at the state level is gaining momentum. At this point the last news came from Alabama. Alabama state auditor Andrew Sorrell has proposed the establishment of a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Sorrell urged Alabama residents to adopt the BTC reserve to protect them from inflation and the economic risks of global de-dollarization. Sorrell said that Bitcoin's value is not affected by the US dollar, that it will strengthen the US balance sheet and that it can be used as collateral for future debt issuances. “A well-balanced portfolio should include exposure to many different asset classes. As of now, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are a $3 trillion asset class that the state has zero exposure to. “It is also the fastest growing asset class with the greatest potential for price appreciation. Investing in Treasuries and bonds is certainly worthwhile. But earning 4% when inflation is 2.7% is only a clean slate.” Satoshi Action Fund co-founder Dennis Porter explained the potential consequences of such a move from Alabama and the US in particular: “The adoption of a strategic Bitcoin reserve would greatly escalate the supply-demand crisis. As more institutions and governments compete for Bitcoin, supply will continue to decrease, putting upward pressure on prices.” Porter also stated that he predicted that a ‘Strategic Bitcoin Reserve’ would be created by a G7 member country and a BRICS member country by the end of 2025. Porter stated that in 2026, the remaining members will fall like dominoes regarding the Bitcoin reserve. https://twitter.com/Dennis_Porter_/status/1866679906484326544 *This is not investment advice.

37511153,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51912,1733932807,"Dogecoin Price Breaks $1 Barrier; Hidden Rival Poised for a 35,204% Surge in Q1 2025","There are predictions of the Dogecoin price to smash through the $1 milestone, marking a historic moment for the meme coin. This breakthrough tells of Dogecoin’s resilience and a growing trend: the hunt for hidden gems with even greater potential. As Dogecoin prices rise, investors focus on a promising new player, PropiChain . This hidden altcoin, merging blockchain with real estate, is projected to mirror DOGE’s rise, surging 35,204% by Q1 2025. Dogecoin Price: Breaking Records and Setting the Tone The Dogecoin price crossing $1 will be a landmark achievement fueled by its strong community, increased utility, and renewed institutional interest. Originally launched as a playful token, Dogecoin has matured into a serious contender in the cryptocurrency space. High-profile endorsements and payment adoption across industries, from tech to entertainment, have bolstered its recent rally. This milestone also rekindles memories of Dogecoin price’s earlier meteoric rise, which climbed from fractions of a cent to nearly $0.70 in 2021. Now, with the $1 barrier set to be broken, analysts predict the Dogecoin price could rise even further, possibly doubling in the coming months. But while Dogecoin’s success is captivating, it paved the way for investors to seek similar high-growth opportunities. One of them is PropiChain , a real estate token quietly revolutionizing property investment and poised to deliver gains far exceeding the Dogecoin price rise. PropiChain: The Hidden Rival with Game-Changing Potential PropiChain is a visionary platform that integrates blockchain with real estate to solve critical inefficiencies in the property market. PropiChain allows fractional ownership by tokenizing real estate, enabling investors to diversify their portfolios with as little as $500. PropiChain Features PropiChain’s standout features are designed to maximize returns while minimizing risk: AI-Driven Market Tools : The project uses artificial intelligence to provide real-time market analysis, personalized property recommendations, and automated valuations. For example, an investor seeking high-yield properties can rely on PropiChain’s AI to identify lucrative opportunities, saving time and ensuring smarter decisions. Blockchain Transparency and Security : Every transaction on PropiChain is secured and verifiable through blockchain technology. This ensures immutability, eliminating disputes over property ownership or value. Its decentralized peer-to-peer model removes the need for costly intermediaries, reducing fees for buyers and sellers. Metaverse Integration : PropiChain’s entry into the metaverse adds an innovative twist. Investors can take virtual property tours, attend meetings with global stakeholders, and even purchase metaverse real estate assets, seamlessly blending physical and digital investment opportunities. Fractional Ownership and Tokenization : This feature democratizes access to high-value real estate previously restricted to the elite and wealthy. For instance, smaller investors can now own a piece of a luxury apartment without needing large capital upfront. Why PropiChain Could Outperform Dogecoin PropiChain’s appeal comes from its practical use case and ability to disrupt a trillion-dollar industry. Here’s why PropiChain is poised for exponential growth: Massive Market Potential : The global real estate market is worth over $300 trillion, and PropiChain is targeting a slice of this pie with its blockchain-based solutions. Early-Stage Advantage : Currently priced at just $0.004 during its presale, PropiChain offers ground-floor access for investors. Proven Credibility : PropiChain is already listed on CoinMarketCap and has undergone a thorough security audit by BlockAudit , ensuring investor confidence. Analysts compare PropiChain’s potential to Dogecoin’s early days, predicting it could skyrocket by 35,204% by Q1 2025. For perspective, if these predictions hold, a $1,000 investment at the current presale price could grow to over $350,000. The Ripple Effect of Dogecoin’s $1 Milestone The Dogecoin price rise to $1 has broader implications for the crypto market. It signals a renewed appetite for risk among retail and institutional investors, paving the way for lesser-known altcoins to gain traction. PropiChain , with its innovative approach and real-world applicability, is perfectly positioned to ride this wave. While Dogecoin thrives on its community and meme culture, PropiChain’s value lies in its practicality. Investors seeking a balanced portfolio should consider allocating funds to Dogecoin and PropiChain for diversified exposure to high-growth assets. Join PropiChain Today PropiChain’s ongoing presale offers a unique opportunity for early adopters. The presale has raised over $1M; the first stage is almost filled. The token’s price is set to rise to $0.011 in the next stage, representing an immediate 275% increase. Those who act now can secure tokens at a fraction of their projected value, setting the stage for life-changing returns. Conclusion The Dogecoin price, set to break $1, marks a turning point in the crypto market, showcasing the power of community-driven growth. But as the spotlight shines on Dogecoin, PropiChain is quietly building momentum, offering investors a chance to participate in a groundbreaking revolution in real estate. With a presale price of $0.004 and predictions of a 35,204% surge by Q1 2025, PropiChain has the potential to outperform even Dogecoin’s impressive gains. Don’t miss an opportunity to diversify your investments and capitalize on the next big thing in blockchain.

37510394,https://blockworks.co/news/hope-for-altcoin-santa-rally,1733932800,Santa rally? Altcoins could use a Christmas miracle,"This is a segment from the Empire newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Brutal week so far for altcoins. In the stock market, you generally look for a Santa Claus rally at the end of December into early January as a nice, green way to close out the year and welcome a new chapter. Whether we could see a similar thing in crypto is still up in the air. Right now it’s looking iffy. On the upside, altcoin leverage managed to hold through Dec. 5, but Monday saw the biggest daily long liquidation event since May 2021, as K33 analysts noted. Ouch. “Ever since the election, long bets have been rewarded. This dynamic allowed open interest to accumulate with a steadily growing long concentration. This growth is evident by looking at total open interest in altcoins relative to the total altcoin market cap,” they wrote. “This metric grew from 3.57% to 4.42% from the election until December 9, amidst a very high funding rate environment in December. [Monday’s] liquidation cascade saw altcoin leverage plunge by $12.8bn, reducing the relative altcoin leverage to 3.96%.” A look at open interest in altcoins To put those metrics into perspective, altcoin open interest marked the “biggest relative decline in altcoin leverage since the FTX collapse.” BitOoda analysts, following Monday’s sell-off, said that they expect more “sideways trading through year-end marked by periods of low liquidity and choppy price action.” And we very well may see that given the highly leveraged products and “exaggerated” price action moves. The good news, however, is that while this is a decently sized bump in the road, it doesn’t sound like it’s impacting the bullish 2025 outlook shared lately by many. Perhaps there’s still hope for a Santa rally. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. Subscribe to the Empire newsletter .

Just In: November US CPI annual inflation rises 2.7%, in line with expectations for 2.7%. Core CPI inflation increased 3.3% Y/Y, matching forecasts for a gain of 3.3%. What will Jerome Powell do now? pic.twitter.com/xgQPwTmokZ — Jesse Cohen (@JesseCohenInv) December 11, 2024 The latest US inflation report delivered no surprises, and markets now price a 96.2% chance of a 25 bps rate cut later this month, per the CME’s Fed Watch tool . The Ethereum price is still down about 7.5% from last week’s highs in the $4,100. But its technical set up looks strong, and many would argue that the latest pullback in the market was healthy, given it cleared out excessive leverage, setting the foundation for a stronger rally. In recent weeks, as ETH rallied from sub-$3000 to its recent highs above $4,000, the funding rate paid by traders looking to take on leverage had swollen to as much as 0.0688%, per coinglass.com . That suggests that the recent price rally had been accompanied by a surge in demand for leveraged long positions, raising the risk of near-term volatility. However, in wake of the latest market correction, funding rates have normalized to around 0.008%, suggesting this speculative excess has been largely wiped from the market. Where Next for Ethereum Price – New ATHs This Month? Now that speculative excess has been taken out of the market, the chances of a more sustainable Ethereum price rally into the year’s end have risen. Fundamentals/macro are certainly a tailwind – the Fed is set to continue cutting interest rates into a strong US economy (which is great for risk assets) and optimism remains high ahead of the arrival of the incoming pro-crypto Trump administration in January. Charts are also sending a bullish signal. The Ethereum price’s recent bounce at $3,500, from its 50DMA and July highs sends a signals that the bulls never really gave up control of this market. As Bitcoin (BTC) pushes back above $100,000 and ETH pushes back above $3,800, a retest of last week’s highs are likely. But could ETH press on to hit new record highs above $4,800 this month? Well, historic patterns in the crypto market and Ethereum’s relationship to Bitcoin suggest the chances are good. Bitcoin is currently trading exactly in line with its four year price cycle, where it breaks out into a new price discover phase within 8 months of the halving. As Bitcoin breaks out to fresh record highs and enters price discovery, Ethereum has historically lagged. It typically takes Ethereum an additional month to even return to its all-time highs, and then another month to break into its own phase of price discovery. History appears to be repeating itself right now, suggesting Ethereum could retest record highs this month, then break substantially above them in January.

37510890,https://invezz.com/?p=2383480,1733932401,APT recovery threatened as Aptos braces for supply shock amid $140M token release,"Digital assets traded upward today as altcoins recovered from last week’s double-digit declines on BTC’s latest uptick past $98K. Meanwhile, Aptos (APT) remains in the woods after gaining over 5% over the past day. Ecosystem developments signal impending dips for APT from current levels. Data shows the project awaits a massive token unlock event, which might catalyze substantial volatility for Aptos prices. Supply shock weakens APT momentum Aptos’ underperformance reflects the bearish wave that swept the crypto market recently. Meanwhile, the upcoming token release, scheduled for December 12, added to the downbeat mode. Token discharges involve unlocking previously locked digital assets to the public. The approach is vital in ensuring a strategic and organized asset distribution to control circulation while safeguarding market stability. Cryptorank data shows the Aptos ecosystem will flood the market with 11.31 million APT coins, representing 2.12% of the total supply on December 12. Source: Cryptorank The tokens are worth $140.11 million at current prices. The massive token release could trigger substantial volatility for APT. Buying momentum would be necessary to counter the looming supply shock, which could see Aptos’ price plummeting. APT’s latest performance confirms the waning momentum. Its market cap surpassed $8 billion as prices touched monthly highs of $15.25 on December 7. Nevertheless, the figure has plunged to $6.56 at press time, losing approximately $2 billion within five days. The sharp drop confirms robust selling activity behind APT’s current price actions. APT price actions Aptos trades at $12.30 after gaining over 5% in the past 24 hours. Source: Coinmarketcap The upside stance emerges as the altcoin space records significant rebounds after the latest flash crash. APT hovered inside an ascending triangle pattern days ago, signaling uptrend continuation. Nevertheless, the alt has plunged beneath the technical setup’s neckline at this publication, confirming a nullified upside breakout. Also, the cumulative volume delta, which measures the variance between selling and buying volumes, dipped into the negative territory. Such movements suggest seller dominance and looming price dips. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence supports the bearish case, with the MACD line making a bearish crossover with the signal line. Such sentiments suggest possible APT declines to the $9.65 footing (in the near term). That would lead to a 22% slump from current prices. Meanwhile, broad market sentiment would be crucial in defining APT’s trajectory in the coming sessions. Popular analysts, including Crypto Rover, remain bullish about the market, forecasting an impending altcoin season.

Bitcoin has had a volatile week, briefly peaking at $100,400 on Monday before dropping below $94,400. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is recovering toward the $100K level again, highlighting ongoing market fluctuations.Remarkably, large-scale Bitcoin holders, commonly known as whales, demonstrated notable activity amid this price movement.342 New Bitcoin Wallets Created by Whales Amid DipMarket data revealed that 342 new wallets holding more than 100 Bitcoin were created during the recent price decline. In particular, these wallets emerged as Bitcoin dropped from $104,000 to the $90K region. Analysts observed that this trend aligns with the broader behavior of whales, who historically capitalize on price dips to bolster their holdings. https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1866829285815882134Despite market volatility, the stable proportion of Bitcoin held by whales, as indicated in a chart by IntoTheBlock , points to long-term confidence among these investors. According to the market intelligence platform, whale holdings remained unchanged over the past 30 days.Mixed Activity Among Investors and RetailMeanwhile, the investor category saw significant activity growth over the past month, with holdings among mid-tier investors increasing by 2.69%. This suggests growing market participation and accumulation by these holders.In contrast, retail participants, who dominate Bitcoin's ecosystem, experienced a slight decline in holdings. Their share decreased by 0.23%, indicating reduced activity or minor sell-offs among smaller holders. Bitcoin Addresses Activity Bullish Patterns and Price ProjectionsAmid these developments, technical analysis provided a positive outlook for Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. Ali Martinez highlighted a bullish cup-and-handle pattern, a known precursor to significant price breakouts. The chart depicted Bitcoin’s gradual recovery from its 2022 low of $15,200 to its recent highs, completing the cup formation. The subsequent consolidation between $50,000 and $70,000 formed the handle, culminating in a breakout above $69,000 in late 2024. Martinez’s analysis projected Bitcoin’s price to reach $275,000 based on this pattern.Separately, Messari founder Ryan Selkis cited Bitcoin’s MVRV z-score to signal further upside potential. The current z-score of 3, well below the historical market top range of 7-10, supports Selkis’s assertion of significant room for growth. Specifically, Selkis stated he would not consider selling Bitcoin until it hits. $180K",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/11/bitcoin-whales-deploy-more-funds-during-dip-creating-342-new-wallets/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bitcoin-whales-deploy-more-funds-during-dip-creating-342-new-wallets,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Here’s some more information about this asset: Fwog ( FWOG ) is a frog-themed memecoin, born out of the rebrand of a failing project (Flog the Frog, or FLOG). When the original team fell out of favor with the community, the community took it upon themselves to relaunch the project. The Solana-based FWOG token has little utility, deriving its value primarily from the strength of its community and memetic appeal. SPX6900 ( SPX ) is a memecoin rallying against the S&P500, on a mission to overtake this traditional financial index. Traders can access the SPX6900 token across several blockchain networks, including Ethereum on Kraken, and on Solana & Base via decentralized exchanges. Like other memecoins, the SPX token does not have any inherent utility — though it can be transferred and held on the above supported chains. Goatseus Maximus ( GOAT ) is a memecoin created by an autonomous AI agent ( Truth Terminal ) that developed an obsession with the obscure “goatse” Internet meme. Launched on Solana with the help of the agent’s founder, the token hit a market capitalization of over $1b in a month. The GOAT token has no utility, but it can be transferred between Solana wallets.

The continent is at the forefront of the crypto revolution, and we are committed to contributing to its growing ecosystem of crypto startups.” Bitget’s crypto registration is now secured in Lithuania, which indicates its commitment to operating securely and transparently within Europe. Bitget’s goals for the Europe and MiCA initiative The European Union’s community policies are quite advantageous for traders. When the requisite precautions are taken, they are also suitable for crypto platforms. According to Bitget, MiCA will enhance the legitimacy and stability of crypto markets by establishing more transparent regulations. This would allow companies to develop new crypto technologies and services with greater confidence, potentially positioning the EU as a global innovation center in the blockchain and crypto sector. The EU’s regulations have included measures to safeguard consumers from fraud, schemes, and market manipulation. These will ultimately promote a greater sense of confidence in the crypto markets, thereby encouraging more individuals to invest and participate. However, there will be restrictions on certain stablecoins, which could affect the liquidity of the crypto market. Still, one outcome of this trend could be the euro’s potential expansion on crypto exchanges or the introduction of new stablecoins on the euro, such as EUR Convertible (EURCV) by Société Générale, which has already been introduced on the European exchange, Bitstamp. Ultimately, a significant number of European investors and speculators may opt for authorized platforms that are more in compliance with regulations, particularly if crypto assets begin to appear on well-known stock trading platforms. Lastly, it is important to note that this has not yet occurred, as Switzerland, which is not a member of the EU, has been the primary European center for the crypto industry. Bitget’s pending operations Bitget stated that it is currently in the process of obtaining regulatory approvals in over 15 jurisdictions worldwide. Recently, Bitget established a strategy to settle in the US under President-elect Donald Trump. BitGet CEO Gracy Chen said , “We are revisiting a US strategy, although we have not decided on anything yet.” Although Trump’s crypto regulations are not clear in the US, newcomers still have the anxiety to deal with a mess of state-based licenses and different government agencies. Gracy Chen explained a solution they could consider, “If we had a local partner who has many of those licenses already, then we could do a joint venture, for example. So we don’t need to go through all the applications. We might take that approach, but it’s not decided yet.” A Step-By-Step System To Launching Your Web3 Career and Landing High-Paying Crypto Jobs in 90 Days.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BGB,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitget-prepares-mica-compliance-in-lithuania/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37509856.jpeg

Crying Kamala (CRYKAMA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because CRYKAMA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Crying Kamala can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crying Kamala could become the next viral memecoin. Crying Kamala launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Crying Kamala on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Crying Kamala by entering its contract address – 5eCJhSGBUN4YwJHLU9ZcWjrjmoufVznjzNBHfo4TN1P7 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CRYKAMA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/crying-kamala-solana-memecoin-to-surge-17000-before-exchange-listings-while-bonk-shib-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

37512624,https://cryptonews.com/?p=318692,1733931638,Kyrgyzstan Passes Law Defining Digital Som CBDC Framework,"Kyrgyzstan has taken a significant step towards launching its central bank digital currency ( CBDC ), the digital som. In its first reading, the Parliament approved a draft law that establishes its framework and legal status. According to a report from Trend , the legislation was Initiated by the Cabinet of Ministers and is poised to set the groundwork for one of the nation’s most ambitious financial projects. Once fully implemented, the digital som will function as Kyrgyzstan’s national currency and be recognized as legal tender nationwide. The National Bank of Kyrgyzstan will oversee its issuance, accounting, and distribution through a centralized platform. This platform, designed for security and efficiency, will grant the central bank exclusive rights to issue the currency. Testing for the prototype is scheduled to begin in early 2025, with full integration into the nation’s financial ecosystem expected by January 2027. Kyrgyzstan Digital Som: A Centralized CBDC? Unlike many global CBDC initiatives that lean heavily on blockchain and distributed ledger technologies, Kyrgyzstan’s approach prioritizes centralized management under the National Bank. The digital som’s framework will integrate features like smart contracts, but avoid explicit reliance on the blockchain. This is mainly because the country is tailored to its specific financial and technological landscape. The platform supporting the digital som aims to enable both online and offline transactions, a critical feature for Kyrgyzstan, where internet access can be inconsistent. Transactions made offline will be stored locally on user devices and synchronized with the platform once connectivity is restored. However, implementing offline functionality presents technical challenges, which have also been a subject of global debate among central banks exploring similar CBDC features. To ensure widespread accessibility, the proposed system will offer digital accounts for participants and digital wallets for individuals. These wallets will be accessible through banking apps and other financial service providers, bridging the gap between digital innovation and traditional monetary systems. Path to Implementation and Strategic Considerations Public consultations on the digital som began in August, including discussions on necessary constitutional amendments to facilitate its integration. Deputy Chairman of the National Bank, Mels Attokurov, emphasized the digital system’s security advantages. Attokurov frames it as a tool to modernize Kyrgyzstan’s financial system while ensuring stability. The government envisions the digital som as a step towards greater financial inclusion, particularly in remote areas. It aims to provide secure, efficient payment options for all citizens, aligning with broader global trends in digital finance. Following extensive prototype testing and feedback, the National Bank will decide on full-scale deployment by the end of 2026. If successful, the digital som will solidify Kyrgyzstan’s position as a leader in adopting digital currencies within Central Asia. Kyrgyzstan is not the only one in the CBDC endeavor. According to the Atlantic Council’s latest report , 134 countries, representing 98% of the global economy, are actively exploring central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), a significant rise from 35 in 2020. The CBDC race is heating up. 134 countries are now exploring digital currencies, covering nearly the entire global economy, according to @AtlanticCouncil . https://t.co/dDzG7B7Zqb — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 17, 2024 Of these, 66 nations have made advanced progress, with countries like the Bahamas, Jamaica, and Nigeria already launching CBDCs and expanding their retail applications. Additionally, 44 countries, including Australia, Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia, are running CBDC pilot programs. This global effort aims to address declining cash use and competition from cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Among major initiatives, China’s digital yuan (e-CNY) leads with nearly $986 billion in transactions across 17 regions, a significant increase from $253 billion the previous year. This initiative impacts key sectors like education and tourism.

In a new interview on Fox Business, Peirce argues that the first step is to stop trying to prevent crypto from accessing the services it needs to move forward, like custody. “Point two is provide clarity around which things are not within the SEC’s ambit. So which things are not securities and which people don’t have to think about the SEC’s regulatory framework.” Peirce, a Republican, says the third step is for regulators to work with crypto firms to determine where existing regulations apply and “where adjustments need to be made.” “And that needs to be a group exercise. That needs to be done in the public so that everyone can participate in it. And I think we can get to a good place and do that relatively quickly. I mean all of these things do take time, but I think if we put our minds to it we can get to a better place, and I’m hoping that won’t take too long.” Peirce and fellow Republican SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda have often criticized SEC Chair Gary Gensler for his active approach toward the crypto sector. Both have also dissented against multiple SEC enforcement actions. Under Gensler’s leadership, the securities watchdog launched high-profile enforcement actions against many crypto firms, including industry giants Binance, Kraken, Coinbase, Ripple Labs, Uniswap Labs and Consensys. After Donald Trump’s election victory last month, Gensler announced he would step down in January, on the president-elect’s inauguration day. The SEC chair’s term was set to run until 2026.

37510375,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=104617,1733930905,Wall Street Expert Agrees XRP is the Greatest Opportunity for Generational Wealth,"A Wall Street analyst endorses a statement suggesting that XRP is among the greatest opportunities for investors to build generational wealth. Notably, the sentiment was originally shared by Digital G, a market commentator, amid the ongoing market turbulence. For context, XRP has been a victim of the latest market correction, which wiped out over $1.7 billion in leverage positions from nearly 584,000 traders .Data suggests that XRP faced one of the worst selloff campaigns for any cryptocurrency, especially on Coinbase. This triggered a massive 14.87% price collapse on Monday, with the altcoin closing the day at the lower end of the $2 price region.XRP Represents an Opportunity for Generational WealthAmid these troubles, XRP has shown impressive resilience, which has helped to maintain optimism around it. As confidence in its potential prevails, Digital G, who was a regulated fund manager in the U.K., recently pointed out the importance of an investment in XRP.He admitted that XRP represents one of the greatest opportunities for any investor to secure generational wealth. Moreover, he believes the two other cryptocurrencies with such potential are Stellar (XLM), an XRP rival, and XDC Network (XDC).Interestingly, Wall Street analyst Linda P. Jones, a vocal XRP proponent, agreed with the commentary. According to her, she authored a book on the assets and how such investments could help investors build life-changing wealth. The wealth mentor was possibly referring to her bestseller “3 Steps to Quantum Wealth.”https://twitter.com/LindaPJones/status/1866095076033646939Interestingly, all three assets focus on helping retail and institutions carry out efficient cross-border payments and financial transactions by providing fast, low-cost, and scalable solutions for transferring value.XRP, XLM and XDC Potential Digital G’s sentiment is possibly due to the fact that these cryptocurrencies, especially XRP, have ecosystems looking to solve real-world problems in finance, such as remittances and settlement, and have partnerships with banks, governments, and enterprises.While they underperformed in previous years, their recent price action confirms the potential for growth. For instance, XRP is up by more than 303% since November, while XLM has gained 448%. Also, XDC has skyrocketed 175% within the same timeframe.As a result, several market analysts have presented lofty targets for these tokens. Recently, market analyst EGRAG argued that XRP was following Tesla’s 2018 trajectory, forecasting a 50% dump before a 3,500% uptick above $40. Meanwhile, last month, Charting Guy, a market commentator, called attention to a bullish price structure on the 1-month XLM chart which he believes could lead to a rally to $5. Earlier this month, Javon Marks set a breakout target of $0.1814 for XDC.",POSITIVE,XLM | XRP | XDC,MARKET | TRADING | XLM | XRP | XDC,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/11/wall-street-expert-agrees-xrp-is-the-greatest-opportunity-for-generational-wealth/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wall-street-expert-agrees-xrp-is-the-greatest-opportunity-for-generational-wealth,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

It appears that whales and long-term holders are continuously betting on the hope of an upside rally, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . $186 Million of ADA Outflow From Exchanges ADA spot inflow/outflow data revealed that exchanges have witnessed a significant $185.89 million worth of ADA outflow since the beginning of December 2024. In cryptocurrency, outflow refers to the movement of assets from exchanges to wallet addresses, which hints at potential acquisitions. Additionally, this outflow indicates potential upside momentum and further suggests an ideal buying opportunity.

According to expert technical analysis, the altcoin appears bullish as it has successfully retraced and is now moving upward. Based on the recent price action, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 15% to reach the $1.25 level in the coming days. Source: Trading View On the positive side, ADA’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 58, which is below the overbought area, indicating that ADA has enough room to rally in the coming days. Current Price Momentum At press time, ADA is trading near $1.08 and has registered a price gain of over 7.10% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume dropped by 28%, indicating lowered participation from traders and investors compared to previous days.",POSITIVE,ADA,ADA | ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/time-to-buy-cardano-186-million-ada-flows-out-of-exchanges/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png
37508937,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=374311,1733930831,"What Does MDIA Tell Us About XRP, DOGE, and BTC’s Upcoming Trends?","After a turbulent correction, the cryptocurrency market has found some calm, with prices stabilizing. Meanwhile, the Mean Dollar Invested Age is quietly pointing to heightened network activity, often seen as a precursor to extended bullish trends. Despite a market-wide retracement this week, the Mean Dollar Invested Age (MDIA) – an often-overlooked crypto metric – signals potential bullish momentum across key assets. Bitcoin’s MDIA has dropped 31% over the past 60 weeks, currently standing at 439 days. XRP’s MDIA has decreased by 22% in just 14 weeks, now at 865 days. Meanwhile, Dogecoin shows the sharpest decline, with its MDIA falling 31% to 370 days over the past eight weeks. This downward trend in MDIA highlights increasing activity from dormant wallets, particularly those of large stakeholders, as older coins re-enter circulation. Historically, this trend has preceded sustained bull markets, with similar patterns observed before the 2017 and 2021 rallies. While short-term price fluctuations are inevitable, this metric lends confidence to mid and long-term bullish outlooks for the crypto market. “Dormant coins are still moving aggressively, validating long-term bull market is still active.. especially for Bitcoin, XRP, and Dogecoin.” What’s Next For Bitcoin and Dogecoin? The MDIA figures follow a period of significant turbulence for Bitcoin, marked by billions of dollars in liquidations. The retail selling spree during this period, however, coincided with aggressive institutional buying, especially by the US investors, which signaled a bullish sentiment despite the crypto trading below the coveted $100,000 mark. Meanwhile, Dogecoin is trading near $0.42 after a 4% surge over the past day. Experts suggest that the OG meme coin could finally kick off an uptrend following the latest pullback. Prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez, for one, has shared an optimistic outlook on Dogecoin’s bull cycle, suggesting it is still in its early stages. He said that the base target remains at $3 and a more ambitious projection of $18 if market conditions become extraordinarily bullish. What’s Going to Drive XRP? According to Arthur Azizov, CEO of B2BINPAY, getting final approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services to launch RLUSD is a game-changer. This could potentially attract even greater investor interest in XRP. In a conversation with CryptoPotato , the exec said, “Already, RLUSD is being viewed as a potential competitor to USDT and USDC. If, as planned, RLUSD is issued on the XRP Ledger, it could provide an additional boost to XRP’s growth. Ripple’s distributed ledger technology is increasingly being recognized by banks and financial institutions, driving new partnerships and a growing demand for its solutions. Given Ripple’s trajectory and the potential of XRP, I anticipate that XRP could trade within the range of $5 to $7 during the first half of 2025.” The post What Does MDIA Tell Us About XRP, DOGE, and BTC’s Upcoming Trends? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",POSITIVE,BTC | DOGE | XRP,BTC | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,Crypto Potato,https://cryptopotato.com/what-does-mdia-tell-us-about-xrp-doge-and-btcs-upcoming-trends/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/37508937.jpeg

Tron eyes bullish reversal after significant price dump Tron suffered price stagnation for the longest time in the crypto space. However, Tron was able to find its momentum when the market was generally pumping. The altcoin set a $0.4407 all-time high recently, yielding over 100% profit within a month. However, Tron has failed to defend this price gain. The altcoin has fallen significantly below its all-time high, with the latest crypto news putting Tron’s dump at 41% since hitting a new all-time high. Tron trades at $0.25 currently but hopes to return to the $0.40 price zone again. The crypto coin will have to overcome current downward pressure before it can experience any bullish run. The market is expected to recover in Q1 2025, and Tron may recover as well. However, analysts do not expect Tron to set a new all-time high in the first quarter of the new year, even though it may rally toward $0.40. SUI eyes $5 in Q1 2025 despite current bear run At some point this year, SUI was listed among the best crypto purchases in 2024. The crypto coin performed excellently this year, moving from an under $1 token in Q1 to a $4.47 all-time in Q4. SUI reached a new all-time high on the 6th of December, but currently battles bear pressure. The token dipped 19% from its peak price, currently trading around $3.64. Despite the current dip, investors are still bullish on SUI . They believe SUI is a high-performing altcoin when the market conditions are good. Hence, many have decided to HODL. Analysis shows that SUI could reward investors’ patience in Q1 2025. SUI could hit $5 soon, making it one to watch out for. Conclusion Tron and SUI look to regain their bullish momentum, but investors are more optimistic about SUI . However, experts have placed 1Fuel above both altcoins, naming it a potential high-rewarding token. 1Fuel is projected to do 1000x by 2025, and investors can gain from it by joining the presale now.

37508919,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98714,1733930737,Ripple’s RLUSD Stablecoin Wins Final Regulatory Approval — Is XRP Ready For A Go At $5?,"According to Ripple CEO Bradley Garlinghouse, the company’s RLUSD stablecoin has officially received final approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). Ripple All Set To Storm Stablecoin Market The regulatory green light, as Ripple boss Brad Garlinghouse revealed, follows months of review, positioning Ripple for the impending mainnet launch of RLUSD. In a post on X, Garlinghouse announced, “This just in… we have final approval from NYDFS for $RLUSD!” This just means that the highly-anticipated dollar-pegged token will soon be listed on major exchanges. Ripple first announced plans for the stablecoin back in April to directly challenge the dominance of Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC. Notably, USDT and USDC currently dominate the nearly $200 billion stablecoin sector. Ripple executives projected the stablecoin could reach a market capitalization of $2 trillion by 2028. RLUSD, designed as a 1:1 US dollar-backed stablecoin, will be backed by USD deposits, short-term US government treasuries, and other cash equivalents. The company started testing RLUSD on the XRP Ledger and Ethereum mainnets in August. Then, in October, Ripple announced partnerships with exchanges, including Uphold, Bitstamp, Bitso, MoonPay, CoinMENA, and Bullish. Ripple strives to leverage both RLUSD and XRP to boost its cross-border payment solutions. Garlinghouse said in September that Ripple planned to have RLUSD focus on institutional players. The price of XRP jumped 10% following the RLUSD approval announcement, erasing Tuesday’s losses where it slipped below $2 for the first time since Dec. 1. The forth-largest cryptocurrency was trading hands for $2.34 as of publication time, according to CoinGecko . Besides helping Ripple enter the fast-growing stablecoin market, RLUSD could also help boost XRP’s price to the much-coveted $5 threshold.

37510373,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=104777,1733930667,Bitcoin Shows Signs of Maturity with Reduced Volatility and Smaller Drawdowns,"Recent analysis from on-chain data provider Glassnode reveals that the current Bitcoin market cycle is experiencing significantly lower average returns than previous cycles. Bitcoin's performance in the ongoing cycle, which began after hitting bottom in November 2022, shows notable changes in return on investment (ROI) and market volatility, according to data shared by the on-chain analytics firm.The data compares the current cycle with the previous two bull markets, highlighting a transition in Bitcoin's behavior as it matures into a larger, more stable asset class.Bitcoin Seeing Least ROIFor example, from Bitcoin's bottom in 2015 to the end of the cycle in 2018, it registered a 5.90X (590%) growth during that bull season.The subsequent cycle, from 2018 to 2022, saw even more impressive gains, with Bitcoin registering a 10.47X (1,047%) price growth from the lows to the highs.In contrast, in the current cycle, where Bitcoin bottomed at around $15K in late 2022, it has so far registered a 598% price growth, based on its recent all-time high of $104K. According to Glassnode, this cycle is 26.94% below the average growth of the last two cycles.Bitcoin Volatility Eases, Experiencing the Least Volatile CycleMeanwhile, regarding market volatility, the current cycle also stands out for its relative stability. When comparing drawdowns or peak-to-trough declines in price, Bitcoin's volatility has significantly decreased. For instance, the average drawdown in the current cycle is -7.68%, much lower than the -16.24% average across all cycles.Likewise, the maximum drawdown has been -26.25% since 2022, compared to a dramatic -71.15% drawdown during the 2011-2013 cycle.This marks Bitcoin's least volatile cycle to date, suggesting that the market is becoming more resilient and less prone to extreme price swings.Bitcoin Seen as a More Stable and Institutionalized Asset ClassAccording to Glassnode, the combination of lower ROI and smaller drawdowns points to Bitcoin's gradual transformation into a more stable, institutionalized asset. These metrics suggest that Bitcoin is no longer as volatile as it once was, a crucial factor for attracting traditional investors and institutional players who demand more stability. https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1866787722377171408Essentially, Glassnode's analysis underscores Bitcoin's growing maturity as an asset class.

Solana Analysis, Trends, and New Rival JetBolt","Solana (SOL) currently trades at $219.75 after a sharp pullback from its all-time high of $263.83, sparking debates on whether SOL is headed for a $400 breakout. As Solana’s staking activity surpasses 400 million tokens, the confidence in its network remains. Meanwhile, a next-gen altcoin is also headlining recent crypto news: JetBolt (JBOLT), with its successful presale turning heads and whales snapping up tokens. Will Solana’s next move break the $400 barrier, or will SOL stall below key resistance levels as new competitors like JetBolt heat up the crypto race? What’s driving JetBolt’s meteoric rise? Let’s dive into the numbers and trends behind Solana and JetBolt, and what it means for these two major crypto players. Solana’s $400 Question: Is SOL Headed for Breakout or Breakdown? Breaking news in the crypto world focuses on Solana (SOL) and its ability to break the $400 mark. Currently trading at $219.75, Solana has faced sharp corrections from its monthly high of $263.83, which was achieved just a few weeks ago. Over the past week, Solana has experienced a sharp drop from $240 to near $210, followed by a modest recovery to $219. 7-day Solana (SOL) price chart from CoinMarketCap showing a drop from $240 to $210 and recovery to $219 Crypto analysts are also eyeing these key technical insights for SOL : Resistance Levels Immediate resistance at $240. Secondary resistance at $280 and $300. Support Levels Critical support at $210. Lower support zones at $194 and $183. Indicators Breaking the 26-day EMA at $229 could signal bullish momentum. A failure to hold above $210 could lead to further declines. Meanwhile, Solana’s ecosystem shows strong resilience, with over 400 million tokens staked, totaling nearly $100 billion in value. Additionally, Solana’s DEX trading volume recently surpassed $100 billion in a single month, doubling Ethereum’s during the same period. Regulatory prospects also add intrigue, as discussions around a spot Solana ETF gain momentum. Although approvals remain pending, expectations are high for possible regulatory clarity in 2025, which could provide a major boost to Solana’s market appeal. While Solana’s long-term outlook remains bullish, whether it can reach $400 depends on favorable market conditions and continued ecosystem growth. For now, Solana holders remain cautiously optimistic.

37510372,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=104784,1733930531,Bitcoin Leverage Finally Easing as Analysts Predict Imminent Recovery,"Bitcoin prices are finally stabilizing after a turbulent period that led to a massive liquidation event that impacted thousands of traders. BTC's value dropped from over $100,000 to $92,000 within 12 hours on Monday, erasing $1.7 billion in leveraged positions from nearly 584,000 traders . However, it has since rebounded, trading above $98,000, with a 2% increase today to $98,661. Bitcoin Market Seeing Drop in LeverageAmid the recovery, market data indicates a slowdown in volatility and a notable reduction in leverage across exchanges. According to CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, the BTC-USDT perpetual futures estimated leverage ratio has been steadily declining. https://twitter.com/ki_young_ju/status/1866787839901569380This ratio, which measures the amount of leverage used in futures trading, fell from 0.511 on Dec. 8 to the current figure of 0.462. The recent ratio further represents a 24% drop from the 0.608 peak recorded on Nov. 21. BTC Estimated Futures Leverage Ratio for the USDT Pair Across All Exchanges BTC Estimated Futures Leverage Ratio for the USDT Pair Across All Exchanges Ju noted that open interest in BTC-USDT futures has decreased by 7% from its recent high, while exchange-held USDT balances have risen by 32% over the past month. Additionally, data shows that ERC-20 USDT tokens on exchanges have surged by 68% since Nov. 1, growing from 23.27 billion to 39.17 billion. This inflow of USDT on exchanges could provide more collateral if market participants use it for futures trading.Notably, the recent reduction in leverage implies fewer high-risk positions, decreasing the likelihood of sharp price swings from liquidations. Meanwhile, the influx of USDT suggests increased buying power, which could fuel further price gains as traders deploy funds.Liquidation Trends Reflect Price RecoveryIn addition, recent data from Coinglass shows that liquidation volumes are declining, with short positions now facing more liquidations than long positions. Liquidation Data Coinglass Liquidation Data | Coinglass Over the last 12 hours, $92.41 million worth of positions were liquidated, with short positions accounting for 60.8% of this amount, or $56.21 million. In contrast, long positions accounted for $36.20 million. This suggests a market recovery, as bullish sentiment begins to strengthen.Analysts Hold Mixed Bitcoin Recovery OutlooksMeanwhile, market analysts and traders hold varying perspectives on Bitcoin's next moves. Ali Martinez, a prominent analyst, pointed out a cup-and-handle pattern on Bitcoin's weekly chart. https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1866517510268330035He has maintained his optimism, predicting that Bitcoin could reach $275,000 if this pattern plays out. The analyst advised traders to buy dips and avoid excessive leverage to minimize risk.Meanwhile, crypto trader XO stressed the importance of Bitcoin holding the $90,000–$91,000 range. He suggested that losing this range could lead to a pullback to $85,000–$87,000. However, XO leans toward continued price compression in the near term.Interestingly, as BTC looks to recover, CryptoQuant analyst Mignolet highlighted that Coinbase's spot market dominance remains relatively low, despite the exchange's major role earlier this year. Following the approval of Bitcoin ETFs in January, Coinbase saw increased dominance, driving market gains during that period. However, during the latest rally in September and October, Coinbase's influence declined, and it has not rebounded massively since.Mignolet emphasized that while Coinbase liquidity remains important, Binance appears to be the more critical source of market liquidity driving the current rally.",POSITIVE,BTC | USDT,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | USDT,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/11/bitcoin-leverage-finally-easing-as-analysts-predict-imminent-recovery/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bitcoin-leverage-finally-easing-as-analysts-predict-imminent-recovery,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
37508918,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98711,1733930519,Billionaire Investor Ray Dalio Would Rather Have Bitcoin Over Bonds Amid Looming Global Debt Crisis,"Famed hedge fund manager and former Bitcoin critic Ray Dalio believes Bitcoin is a better buy than bonds. Speaking during the Abu Dhabi Finance Week in the United Arab Emirates, the founder of the world’s biggest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, warned about the unsustainable amounts of debt in major economies, stressing his preference for “hard money” such as Bitcoin and gold. “I want to steer away from debt assets like bonds and debt and have some hard money like gold and Bitcoin,” he quipped, as reported on Dec. 10 by the South China Morning Post . Dalio argued that besides Germany, other nations like the US and China have witnessed indebtedness grow at “unprecedented levels”. In his opinion, it’s “impossible for these countries to be able to not have a debt crisis” in the coming years that will lead to a huge money devaluation. Ray Dalio’s Complicated Relationship With Bitcoin Dalio, one of the globe’s wealthiest men, has historically held both positive and negative sentiments about BTC. “I don’t think digital currencies will succeed in the way people hope they would,” he posited in 2020, citing inherent volatility, limited use cases, and a lack of government control. He first admitted owning some Bitcoin back in May 2021. But despite describing Bitcoin as “one hell of an invention”, Dalio claimed that the flagship crypto could end up being killed by the government if it became too successful . Later the same year, the billionaire’s stance softened somewhat as he asserted that Bitcoin was “the younger generation’s alternative” to gold. In 2022, the billionaire investor recommended a 1% to 2% Bitcoin allocation for investor portfolios. Back then, Dalio lauded BTC for its resilience against hacks and stated that it had no better challenger in the market. But in Feb. 2023, he said during a CNBC interview that he doesn’t like Bitcoin. “It’s not going to be an effective money,” he opined at the time, adding: “It’s not an effective storehold of wealth. It’s not an effective medium of exchange.” Bitcoin hit an all-time high last week of $103,679 after breaching the long-anticipated $100,000 milestone . However, it has cooled off in the last day, currently priced at $99,827.

37508801,https://crypto.news/?p=14318450,1733930502,There’s a new hidden altcoin gem everyone’s talking about,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Lightchain AI reshapes blockchain with AI, while a new altcoin sparks speculative buzz in the crypto world. Table of Contents Lightchain AI vs. the new altcoin solution What’s the appeal of the altcoin? Potential insights Lightchain AI sets the bar higher Final thoughts Cryptocurrency is no stranger to innovation, and the search for the “next Bitcoin” is ongoing. A new coin enters the conversation. But is it truly the game-changer it claims to be, or is there a deeper story to uncover? Before we get to that, let’s talk about Lightchain AI, an ecosystem already redefining blockchain innovation and artificial intelligence. Lightchain AI Presale is now live. Lightchain AI has brought major improvements to blockchain technology, combining artificial intelligence innovations like the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM). Unlike anything else in the market, Lightchain AI doesn’t just accelerate blockchain adoption; it magnifies its functionality with real-world AI applications. With tools actively transforming decentralized governance, scalability, and privacy-focused AI tasks, this is a key player. But let’s explore the potential of the hidden gem while comparing it to the capabilities already offered by Lightchain AI. Lightchain AI vs. the new altcoin solution The altcoin we’re reviewing today is making waves for its application of unique tokenomics. However, while it has captured attention with its speculative trading markets and a small but enthusiastic developer backing, it’s hard to overlook the ecosystem Lightchain AI is building. Lightchain AI creates a foundation that addresses scalability, security, and AI-specific tasks, areas where many new altcoins fall short. Why Lightchain AI stands out: Proof of Intelligence (PoI): Unlike standard Proof of Stake or Proof of Work mechanisms, PoI rewards nodes for contributing AI computations like model training and inference, offering far more real-world value. AI Virtual Machine (AIVM): A next-gen computational layer enabling developers to build advanced dApps with ease, none of the clunky hurdles other altcoins experience. Transparent and Auditable AI Frameworks: Ensures trust and accountability for AI governance decisions within a decentralized network. With these core mechanisms in mind, Lightchain AI fosters an ecosystem where utility outpaces hype in defining value. You might also like: Solana hits new highs as Lightchain AI aims to be the next big contender What’s the appeal of the altcoin? The altcoin gem we’ve come across primarily markets itself as an alternative store of value rather than a direct Bitcoin competitor. Its limited supply and attention from influencers in the crypto space have led to a price surge that is turning heads. For traders looking for short-term gains, this altcoin is an attractive speculative option. However, outside of its scarcity model and dedicated community marketing, its fundamental utility compared to platforms like Lightchain AI is limited. While Lightchain AI operates with foresight into practical application and governance frameworks, this altcoin remains a speculative play with unresolved scalability issues. Key weaknesses of the altcoin Scalability challenges: The network experiences bottlenecks, potentially leading to performance issues if adoption grows rapidly. Limited use cases: Apart from trading, real-world applications remain elusive, something Lightchain AI has already resolved with AIVM and AI-driven dApp capabilities. Uncertain longevity: Unlike Lightchain AI’s developer-focused ecosystem with long-term roadmaps, this altcoin lacks depth in its operational vision. Potential insights Here’s something to ponder—investors should always align their crypto investments with tangible utility. This altcoin, while intriguing, raises questions about whether it offers anything new long-term or if it’s another fleeting sensation. Consider opportunities like Lightchain AI, which champions innovation over speculation, ensuring it serves both tech-focused developers and value-seeking investors alike. Now is the perfect time to review where users’ crypto portfolio is headed. Explore the Lightchain AI Presale and secure discounted tokens before the first stage ends.

37508747,https://thecoinrise.com/coincheck-makes-history-with-public-debut-on-nasdaq/,1733930437,Coincheck Makes History With Public Debut on Nasdaq,"Coincheck, Japan’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange, has taken a bold step by signaling growth by listing on NASDAQ. According to a report , Coincheck is merging with Thunder Bridge Capital. The move makes Coincheck the second crypto exchange to go public in the U.S. Coincheck’s Journey to Nasdaq Listing Coincheck’s final bold step to this historic moment commenced in May 2024 when the companies filed their final F-4 form with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Coincheck had several revisions to meet the requirements for entering the U.S. market as a foreign company. Notably, Coincheck attempted public listing in 2022 via a de-SPAC merger deal. Although the Japanese exchange valuation stood at $1.25 billion, it suffered setbacks. Sources familiar with the deal cited delays after increased disclosure requirements for SPAC. For context, de-SPAC refers to when a private company merges with a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC). SPAC, on its par,t is a shell company that assists in fundraising via an initial public offering (IPO). The aim is to acquire a firm wishing to go public. A New Era for Coincheck Coincheck’s entry into the U.S. financial space comes when the cryptocurrency market registers significant growth. The uptick in price performance of different assets, with Bitcoin, Ethereum , and other assets hitting new highs, has increased interest in the sector. Ahead of this moment, Coincheck in November had expressed their desire to go public. According to the exchange, listing on the NASDAQ will expose it to international investors . In addition, it hopes to use the platform to recruit talents and engage in global acquisitions. This would strengthen and expand its crypto business. Coincheck’s Resilient Move Post 2018 The exchange is entering the U.S. market with an initial capitalization of $1.3 billion. In 2021, Thunder Bridge IV raised $230 million in its June IPO. The merger with Coincheck will see the effect of a name change. The new company will be known as Coincheck Group N.V., trading under the ticker CNCK. The U.S. SEC approved all necessary registration documents in November, which paved the way for shareholders to vote on the merger last week. Meanwhile, the crypto community is pushing back against commissioners whose anti-crypto stance may frustrate related listings. This marks a significant milestone for Coincheck, which suffered a hack on its exchange in 2018. Despite losing $530 million worth of NEM tokens, Coincheck settled users from its capital and bounced back, a move that showed resilience.

Bitcoin ( BTC ), the biggest cryptocurrency, was trading at $98,900 on Dec. 11, lower than the all-time high of about $104,000. Crypto analysts believe the coin has more upside potential as demand continues to grow while supply diminishes. In a recent piece, the Wall Street Journal noted that the coin’s supply was one of the primary reasons why it will continue rising in value. Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million coins, with over 19.7 million already mined, leaving only 1.3 million yet to be created. Furthermore, millions of coins have been lost and are unlikely ever to be recovered.

Interestingly, the XRP price appears to have beaten other leading altcoins to the punch with its 5.12% uptick since 00:00 UTC, affirming bullish end-of-year projections for the altcoin . While XRP did not escape the liquidation event unscathed, suffering a 12.34% drawdown, it has been the quickest to recover. Coupled with a 12% jump in trading volume to $24 billion, it seems that the reversal is backed by significant momentum. Is XRP Clear of the Crash? The uptick today represents a play-out of bullish predictions by expert analyst Casi Trades on X . In her recent analysis, she noted two scenarios that could lead to a reversal and set the XRP price well on the path to a new all-time high. Though the first scenario did not come to fruition, the second one has, with the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level ($1.94–$2.04) proving a “pivot point” in the recent downtrend, following an ABC pattern. Here’s some positive perspective on this correction: A .382 retrace still aligns our extension targets perfectly with #XRP 's previous ATH—markets love this kind of symmetry! Unless $1.94 is broken, this target holds! https://t.co/VxDAq7Pyy5 — CasiTrades (@CasiTrades) December 10, 2024 The successful bounce from this support has re-ignited bullish momentum, seen in today’s surge, and reaffirmed a potential path to XRP’s past all-time high at $3.50. Particularly as the bearish symmetrical triangle pattern breakout neared its target, $1.94 does seem a credible bottom to the correction. XRP Price Analysis: Is a New All-Time High Next? Going forward, XRP’s path to a new all-time high seems credible with the formation of an ascending broadening wedge since early November. XRP / USDT 4H Chart, ascending broadening wedge pattern.

While a retest of the 50 SMA may temporarily stall today’s growth, the MACD line indicates bullish sentiment with a crossover above the signal line. This move, in recent history, has consistently led to significant upticks in the XRP price. Therefore, a push to $3.50, representing a 50% advance on current prices, seems plausible. However, the analyst notes the range between $3.50 and $3.74 remains a critical pivot zone where the market will define future trends.

37508917,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98710,1733930261,"Trump Would Love For Bitcoin To Hit $150,000 Early In His Presidency, New Report Reveals","Bitcoin smashed its $100,000 price target on Dec. 5 for the first time ever and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump took a victory lap alongside Bitcoiners, claiming credit for the asset’s astronomical price rally. Now, a recent report claims that Trump wants BTC to continue on its uptrend and eventually reach $150,000, reflecting his focus on the token’s price as a measure of the United States’ economic success. Trump Aims For $150,000 BTC As per an Axios report on Dec. 10, which cited an unnamed “transition” source, Trump has expressed a desire for Bitcoin to surpass $150,000. The source claimed that the President-elect “is going to be very focused on the price of Bitcoin” as the top crypto is “another stock market” for the billionaire politician. During his first term in office, Trump often highlighted the performance of the stock market as a measure of how well his administration was managing the country’s economy. Bitcoin and other crypto assets have witnessed a dramatic surge since his election victory against Kamala Harris in early November, with BTC recently spiking past the $100,000 milestone . The asset’s lifetime high price mark now stands at $103,679. Trump began courting the Bitcoin community earlier last year, even making several promises at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville. Since then, he has followed through on one of those promises: The President-elect recently nominated pro-crypto regulator Paul Atkins as SEC chairman. Atkins will replace crypto foe Gary Gensler who is set to resign in January. Axios also reported that Trump plans to promote crypto-friendly regulations and end perceived regulatory hostility in the US during his regime. Will Trump Keep All His Campaign Promises On Crypto? Trump also previously vowed not to sell any of the United States Bitcoin confiscated from criminals and establish a national BTC reserve. After the election victory, Wyoming Senator and Trump supported Cynthia Lummis in fact submitted legislation for the government to purchase 1 million BTC and hold it for at least 20 years. However, former New York Federal Reserve Bank President Bill Dudley has cast doubt on Trump’s plan to create a Bitcoin reserve. Dudley said that despite Bitcoin’s parabolic surge to over $100K, it was “hard to fathom” how the government holding the crypto would benefit its citizens. According to him, Bitcoin doesn’t qualify as money as it is slow and expensive to conduct transactions and people often lose access to their crypto wallets. Dudley believes the main reason Bitcoin enthusiasts have supported policies to create a national reserve would be to “send the price soaring” rather than confer benefits on American non-HODLers. Dudley is not the only former government official to criticize the plan. As ZyCrypto covered earlier, US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers called Trump’s idea “crazy,” contending that establishing a BTC reserve would merely be an attempt to “pander to generous special interest campaign contributors.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/trump-would-love-for-bitcoin-to-hit-150000-early-in-his-presidency-new-report-reveals/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

Apart from two notable instances where sharp moves to the upside were seen in March and July, the asset has been subject to range-bound price movements for most of 2024. The wider crypto market bull run that kicked off in early November following the re-election of Donald Trump has had an outsized effect on RAY prices. Just for reference, since November 5, Bitcoin ( BTC ) prices have increased by 50.62% — in contrast, Raydium has seen a 70.24% surge in the same timeframe. This has brought returns since December of 2023 up to 672.37%. At press time, RAY was trading at $5.60 and has seen a strong 78.16% increase in volume in the last 24 hours alone. A lot of our readers might not be familiar with this digital asset — even accounting for the impressive returns that we’ve mentioned, RAY is only the 74th largest cryptocurrency in the world, with a market capitalization of roughly $1.63 billion, per CoinMarketCap . Raydium price 1-year chart. Source: CoinMarketCap Knowledge is power, after all — and apparently, it can also be quite profitable. This latest rally has put Raydium in the crypto community’s spotlight — here’s what Finbold readers should know about this potentially lucrative investment. Raydium is a decentralized exchange — and RAY is a crucial part of it Raydium is a cryptocurrency platform that allows users to trade directly with one another — no middleman is involved. The platform is built on the Solana ( SOL ) blockchain, ensuring that transactions are both quite cheap and fast. RAY is the platform’s native token — it is used to pay transaction fees, provide liquidity for the exchange, as well as for staking. In exchange for these activities, users are generally awarded additional RAY, discounts, or voting rights regarding the platform’s development. As an exchange, Raydium has seen quite the uptick lately — in Q3 2024, it secured the majority of Solana’s DEX volume, surpassing even Uniswap. Solana, in turn, accounts for roughly 50% of global DEX volume. In November, the platform accounted for more than 60% of Solana’s daily trading volume, per crypto intelligence company Messari . Raydium’s DEX volume share. Source: Messari The ongoing bull run was certainly a favorable tailwind — but it was the beginning of alt season and the shift toward meme coins that has truly cemented Raydium as a force to be reckoned with. Meme coins have driven 65% of the platform’s monthly volume — and with most analysts expecting alt season to last for quite a while, it’s likely that we haven’t seen the last of RAY’s moves upward.

Floki Inu is pushing boundaries by introducing a debit card that supports eight blockchains across 31 European countries—a move that showcases its growing utility in real-world applications. Brett, on the other hand, continues to thrive as the cultural mascot of Base Chain, solidifying its position as a meme coin with a strong ecosystem. And then there’s BTFD Coin , the new kid on the block, roaring into the spotlight with a presale that has raised $2.8 million in just ten stages. Over the years, meme coins have transitioned from being purely speculative to carving out innovative niches in the crypto space. With the rise of coins like BTFD Coin, the game is evolving yet again, offering investors a chance to ride the bull run early. Wondering what makes these three coins the best meme coins to join this month ? Let’s dive in. BTFD Coin Bulls Roar with $2.8M Presale Success Imagine being part of a movement where every market dip feels like an opportunity instead of a setback. That’s the essence of BTFD Coin—short for “Buy The F***ing Dip”—a meme coin that’s more than just a catchy name. It’s a rallying cry for savvy investors ready to turn downturns into their next big win. Currently in its 10th presale stage, BTFD Coin has already sold over 45 billion coins and raised an impressive $2.8 million. The coin’s price is set at $0.0001, offering a massive potential ROI of 500% by the time it lists at $0.0006. But the real magic is in how BTFD brings together fun, innovation, and a strong community ethos. Here’s a scenario to think about: You invest $5,000 at the current presale price. That gives you a staggering 50 million BTFD coins. When the presale ends and the coin hits its listing price, your initial investment could skyrocket to $30,000. That’s six times your money before BTFD even fully enters the market. And if its Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming ecosystem and 90% APY staking rewards gain traction, the upside could go far beyond that. What’s making this presale so electrifying is the community of over 4,200 bulls backing BTFD Coin. This isn’t just a crypto investment—it’s a movement where meme lovers and smart investors unite to own the dip and run with the bulls. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or new to crypto, BTFD Coin makes it easy to see the potential in every market moment. So, don’t wait, and consider BTFD as one of the best meme coins to join this month. Floki Inu Innovates with Utility and Expansion Floki Inu has always had a reputation for being more than just a meme coin, and its latest innovation proves it. The launch of its debit card, available in physical and virtual forms across 31 European countries, takes meme coin utility to a whole new level. This isn’t just a card; it’s a bridge between crypto and everyday financial transactions, allowing users to fund the card with FLOKI or other cryptocurrencies from eight supported blockchains. The impact? Increased adoption and a significant boost in investor confidence. Floki Inu’s 3% rise over the past week showcases its resilience and growth, even in a volatile market. The coin’s Viking community remains one of its biggest strengths, driving engagement and fostering loyalty among its holders. With such real-world utility and a thriving community, Floki Inu is cementing itself as a standout in the meme coin world. The question now is, can it expand this innovation to other regions and attract even more investors? Only time will tell, but the outlook is undeniably positive.

According to sources, a single Solana validator has extracted over $60 million from “Sandwich Attacks” in a month. This was done using Solana’s blockchain architecture – which facilitates MEV activities like sandwich attacks – to its benefit and users’ harm. The onchain and DeFi analyst, core developer of DefiLlama, 0xngmi, commented on the matter, highlighting the $60 million profit. “And that’s only profits,” he added. “Total user losses are higher because you need to include validator bribes,” the transaction priority fees users have to pay. Arsc: The Solana validator profiting from MEV sandwich attacks Essentially, the discussion gained traction once Ben, the core developer of Temporal (@temporal_xyz), posted about the matter on December 10. Ben revealed three accounts linked to Arsc that are actively used to carry out the attacks and stake the profits. DKLvbSugkGMf4PBMakfHW9BdvcYj7Y7FRbsiL6v5DRy2 – Sandwich attack bot account. Source: SolScan / Ben / Finbold According to the post, Arsc is a Solana validator that uses its block-producing privileges to front-run users with a sandwich attack bot, aiming to increase its revenue from Maximum Extractable Value tactics. MILLIONS of dollars in MEV are siphoned away DAILY by vpe (aka arsc), the top sandwich bot. But the worst part? This isn’t just about MEV—it’s about centralization of MEV. And it’s the greatest threat to Solana’s decentralization I’ve seen. Solana’s volume is skyrocketing, and… pic.twitter.com/v6mlSQhtg1 — Ben ⌛ (@HypoNyms) December 10, 2024 As a solution to the problem, Ben proposes either whitelisting/blacklisting “good/bad” validators or using a Public mempool. Both solutions, however, involve some sort of centralized coordination and received criticism from other experts and commentators. “Whitelist/blacklist just leads to censorship, centralization, and backroom deals,” said Viktor Bunin, Protocol specialist at Coinbase. “The way to decrease sandwiching is through better slippage parameterization, intents/solvers, better dex design, or a rebate solution like Flashbots Protect.” What is an MEV sandwich attack, and why Solana? An MEV Sandwich Attack in Solana involves malicious actors exploiting transaction ordering to profit at the expense of regular users. This manipulation ensures the user always gets the worst price while the attacker reaps the benefits. These actors, typically validators or those with access to private mempools, place two transactions around a target user’s transaction: one before buying the asset at a low price and another after selling it at a higher price, thus “sandwiching” the user’s trade. Essentially, this practice harms users by increasing their transaction costs and reducing the fairness of the trading environment. Only a few validators benefit, as they control the transaction order in Solana’s leader-based block production system. Interestingly, Solana’s architecture makes it particularly conducive for such attacks due to its high-speed transaction processing and absence of an in-protocol mempool. Instead, some validators use private mempools which allow them to see and manipulate transactions before they are finalized. This scenario has led to significant MEV revenue for these validators, often at the direct cost of user experience and network integrity. Moreover, Solana’s architecture makes it difficult for external observers to spot MEV tactics like sandwich attacks, raising concerns about data obscurity and questions on how much of Solana’s Real Economic Value (REV) is actually coming from predatory value extraction. This is especially relevant as SOL supporters often mention REV as a leading metric that puts Solana ahead of competitors like Ethereum ( ETH ). However, Mert—CEO of Helius Labs, Solana’s largest RPC provider—explained that Sandwich Attacks only amount to a small share of the chain’s REV. “The last piece of data on this [sandwich attacks] is that it’s a single digit of total rev, this is what im referencing — the vast majority of revenue is via prioritizing [transactions] to land faster,” Mert said in a thread. As things develop, traders, investors, users, and enthusiasts discuss the MEV sandwiching attacks and potential solutions. For now, users who do not want to fall victim to such attacks could use Helius tools or opt for chains with built-in MEV protection like MultiversX ( EGLD ). Featured image from Shutterstock.

37509148,https://invezz.com/?p=2383281,1733929921,Kyrgyzstan advances national digital currency plans​,"Kyrgyzstan has moved ahead with plans for a full rollout of its national digital currency, the digital som. According to a local media report on December 11, the Kyrgyzstan parliament has approved the draft version of a law that establishes a regulatory framework for its central bank digital currency (CBDC). With this approval, the National Bank of Kyrgyzstan, the country’s central bank, will be able to begin prototype testing for the CBDC in early 2025. After the testing period, which is expected to last through the end of 2026, the regulator will issue its decision on a nationwide rollout. Discussions over the plans to amend laws to integrate the digital som into the country’s financial system began earlier this year. In August, the central bank proposed the law, which will positioned it as the sole issuer and regulator of the CBDC. Very little is known about the digital som, but it is expected to leverage smart contracts according to the draft law presented in the parliament. The platform will facilitate transactions and interactions between the operator, participants, and users. The system will include digital wallets and digital accounts, which will act as the foundation for transactions. Digital accounts will act as a centralised record managed by the platform operator, while digital wallets will let users securely send and receive money through banking apps and financial platforms. Further, the system will support both online and offline transactions. Offline transactions will be recorded on the user’s device and will be synchronised to the main network later on. Governance for the cryptocurrency will be managed by the central bank, which will oversee the issuance and accounting of digital soms, define platform rules, manage encryption keys, and ensure the platform’s security and operational integrity. Centralisation could impact digital som use Centralised control is a concerning factor that often deters the public from fully trusting and adopting digital currencies, as it contradicts the decentralised ethos many associate with cryptocurrencies. For instance, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s public consultation on its potential CBDC revealed that the majority of respondents were concerned about government control, citing increased traceability and reduced privacy as key issues. With the National Bank of Kyrgyzstan planning centralised governance for the digital som, similar concerns about government control, financial monitoring, and reduced privacy could arise, potentially impacting public trust and adoption. CBDC plans across the globe Several jurisdictions across the globe are mulling the launch of their respective state-backed currencies. India, for instance, has been testing the digital rupee since 2022 and has gradually implemented various features and plans to integrate the CBDC with the nation’s existing payment infrastructures. However, the Reserve Bank of India has advocated for a cautious approach, emphasising the need to avoid rushing the retail rollout. Elsewhere, the Philippines recently completed the proof-of-concept of its wholesale central bank digital currency. Dubbed Project Agila, the CBDC is designed to enable secure, round-the-clock interbank fund transfers using distributed ledger technology.

The companies revealed the strategic partnership on December 11 at the Abu Dhabi Finance Week. According to details in the announcement , the alliance will target global adoption of USDC and crypto. In this case, the collaboration will see Binance expand USDC access and usability across its products and services. What does this mean for USDC? Integration means more of Binance’s over 240 million users across the globe will tap into the Circle stablecoin for their trading, payments and saving. The exchange will also aid in USDC’s adoption by adding the USD-pegged stablecoin to its corporate treasury. “Circle is without a doubt one of the most trusted and innovative companies in the digital asset ecosystem, and USDC is one of the preeminent products in the world. Through our strategic partnership, our users will have even more opportunities to use USDC on our platform, including more USDC trading pairs, special promotions on USDC across trading, and other products on Binance,” Richard Teng, chief executive officer of Binance, said in a statement. The two crypto ecosystem giants will also seek to leverage their technologies and footprint to accelerate overall industry growth. Binance is set to benefit from more than Circle’s stablecoin technology – it will tap into the liquidity as well as other blockchain tools to enhance user trust. The exchange also sees the partnership as key to traction across the global finance and commerce markets, with stablecoins now a major part of the traditional finance industry’s entry into the crypto market. “With Binance rapidly becoming the world’s leading financial super app, and stablecoin adoption and utility at the core of this future financial system, this is a tremendous opportunity for USDC as it becomes ubiquitous on the Binance platform. I’m thrilled to be working with the Binance leadership team as they continue to build the largest digital asset company in the world,” Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle, added in a press release. USDT dominates Circle and Binance’s collaboration on USDC comes a few years after the exchange picked the now halted stablecoin BUSD over USDC. However, with stablecoin regulation taking a clearer path across the world, this new alliance could help the Tether (USDT) competitor eat into its rival’s market share. Currently, USDT outpaces USDC in market cap with $138 billion compared to $40 billion. This growth for Tether just received a boost with approval in Abu Dhabi. However, and notably, USDC is benefitting from Circle’s key regulatory milestones. This includes being the first get approval in Canada and the EU . This comes as some exchanges delist several stablecoins in the EU for non-MiCA compliance. Meanwhile, Ripple has announced that its stablecoin Ripple USD (RLUSD) will soon launch for the public.

The RBI’s CBDC pilot includes both retail and wholesale applications and features 16 participating banks. The initiative has expanded beyond basic payments to explore offline and programmable use cases. Das highlighted the programmability feature as a significant enabler for financial inclusion, facilitating the precise delivery of funds to targeted beneficiaries. Despite its ambitious scope, the adoption of the digital rupee has been modest. By late June, only one million retail transactions were recorded, achieved through local banks’ incentivization measures, such as partially paying employee salaries using state-issued digital currency. Balancing Innovation and Caution As India Leads in Crypto Adoption While the RBI had initially pushed for 1 million transactions per day to assess scalability, the effort has slowed, raising concerns about long-term viability. RBI Deputy Governor T. Rabi Sankar emphasized the importance of patience and a measured approach . “A full understanding of the underlying CBDC technology’s impact is necessary before scaling its usage nationwide,” he said in November. India’s CBDC strategy also includes ambitious plans for cross-border payments. In November, the RBI sought to collaborate with trading partners in Asia and the Middle East to expand its instant settlement platform.

This price zone is critical, as a breakout above it could ignite a substantial rally to unprecedented levels. XRP Analysis By Shayan The Weekly Chart After an extended accumulation phase within the $0.3–$0.9 range, Ripple witnessed intensified buying pressure, triggering a powerful surge. The price soared approximately 490% from the lowest levels, reclaiming multiple key resistance levels, including the pivotal $2 mark. However, XRP now faces a significant supply zone around $3, where selling pressure could hinder further advances. Additionally, the RSI indicates overbought conditions, suggesting a likely consolidation phase within the $2–$3.4 range. This pause would allow the market to absorb selling pressure before buyers potentially mount a decisive attempt to break through this psychological resistance and set a new ATH. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, XRP encountered strong resistance at the $3 region, triggering notable selling activity and a price rejection. This pullback signals a temporary loss of bullish momentum, possibly reflecting profit-taking and distribution among market participants. Following the rejection, Ripple entered a consolidation phase, breaking below its multi-week ascending trendline. This development suggests increasing dominance of sellers and a likely corrective phase in the near term. Market volatility and fluctuations could intensify, with the $2 level acting as a critical support zone. After this consolidation period, Ripple is expected to regain bullish traction, with another attempt to breach the $3 resistance likely on the horizon.

Following Bitcoin 's recent $100,000 price milestone , the crypto market is largely optimistic, with most setting their sights on new upward targets. However, amid the wave of excitement, one Bloomberg analyst has offered a different outlook.Be Careful What You Wish for?For a long time, Bitcoin proponents have tried to sell the asset to traditional investors as gold, only more liquid and accessible 24/7.With the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. in January 2024, this narrative is now taking root. These ETFs have helped push the total value held by global spot Bitcoin ETFs to about $125 billion, closing in on gold's $225 billion. To be sure, this growth has been a key contributor to Bitcoin's recent rise.However, according to a post today from Bloomberg Senior Commodity Strategist Mike McGlone, this growth presents a problem for the oranged-themed digital asset and an opportunity for the traditional store value when looking at ETFs. https://twitter.com/mikemcglone11/status/1866818651774415204The analyst explained that at current levels, Bitcoin ETFs now offer a similar reward potential and headwinds as gold ETFs but with higher risks as the digital asset remains three times as volatile as the metal. As such, the analyst posits that investors may be more likely to choose gold when forced to pick between the two.Meanwhile, there are other reasons McGlone believes gold looks promising compared to Bitcoin in the short term.Bitcoin Overstretched?In a separate post on Wednesday, Bloomberg's McGlone highlighted that, unlike gold, Bitcoin's price action appears to be highly correlated with U.S. equities, which he argued appeared overstretched. For context, Bitcoin and the S&P 500 have surged to new highs in the month following Donald Trump's election victory, while gold has declined.The analyst suggested that investors could flee to the traditional store of value in the possible event of a significant stock market rout. The analyst drew parallels between current market conditions ahead of the incoming Donald Trump administration and the president-elect's first time in office. During Trump's tenure, gold jumped 52% from over $1,200 to over $1,800. Still, the U.S. stock market was no laggard during the time, as the S&P 500 also gained 50%.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/11/heres-why-bitcoins-100k-price-milestone-favors-gold/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=heres-why-bitcoins-100k-price-milestone-favors-gold,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

This decisive measure is in direct response to the increasing debate over a new tax regime geared primarily at streamers and digital influencers. Milei’s decision highlights the continuous turmoil inside his administration as it deals with the complex problems offered by an expanding digital economy, all while navigating Argentina’s terrible economic crisis. A controversial tax initiative According to emerging accounts from local media outlets, Mizrahi’s unexpected resignation was prompted by considerable public dissatisfaction with the recent introduction of a controversial tax policy. This strategy is aimed primarily at digital content providers, and under its provisions, streamers and influencers must declare any money made through prominent social media platforms such as YouTube, Instagram, and Twitch. This statement covers a wide range of revenue streams, including earnings from brand collaborations, sponsored content, and numerous advertising deals. Critics of the tax plan argue that it disproportionately disadvantages young, developing producers, who may lack the financial resources to comply with such tax demands. They fear that this could hinder Argentina’s thriving digital economy, where content creation and online entrepreneurship have grown significantly in recent years. The public outcry was immediate and loud, with many individuals perceiving the levy as an overreach of government authority that may dissuade prospective international investment and limit local talent’s growth. Milei’s office issued a message on the social media platform X (previously Twitter) to reassure the public that their administration values the developing digital economy and has no intention of taking punitive measures against online enterprises. However, the decision to remove Mizrahi from her post represents a dramatic shift in Milei’s economic strategy, as he seeks to shore up his administration’s credibility in the face of persistent criticism. Milei’s economic vision is under scrutiny President Javier Milei, who took office less than a year ago, has established a reputation for his bold and frequently contentious economic changes geared primarily at rectifying Argentina’s long-standing economic problems. These issues include high inflation and an extremely complex tax structure, which has historically irritated both individuals and corporations. His administration has targeted massive budgetary reforms, including considerable cutbacks in government worker numbers and a full overhaul of the country’s complex tax structure. Local media suggest that the decision to replace Mizrahi was motivated by a negative review of Argentina’s tax agency’s performance, as well as increased displeasure with the agency’s exorbitant wages and mounting tensions within the government itself. The need to adapt and modify economic policies has grown more urgent as Argentina grapples with hyperinflation, a challenge that has worsened in recent years. This economic turbulence has resulted in a significant shift toward digital assets among the general public, as many people seek alternatives to traditional savings in reaction to declining purchasing power. Recent trading statistics from October 2024 serve as a stark illustration of the economic instability, revealing that consumer prices surged by an astonishing 193% year-on-year, marking the sixth consecutive month of disinflation, even as it presents the country with the lowest inflation rate increase experienced throughout the year to that point. In stark contrast, figures from September indicated a staggering inflation rate of 209%, clearly evidencing the pronounced volatility that characterizes the Argentine economic landscape. Debate on economic policies Milei’s economic policies have sparked passionate debates and discussions around the nation, splitting individuals and stakeholders alike. Milei’s reform supporters fervently claim that these steps are critical to stabilizing the economy and reining in runaway inflation, which has severely damaged ordinary Argentines’ purchasing power. Supporters underline the crucial need to create a climate that promotes investment and innovation, particularly in the digital sector. In contrast, sceptics express grave concerns about the potential societal consequences of Milei’s changes, particularly for the most vulnerable elements of the community. Critics say that, while strict economic changes may be necessary, they frequently come at the expense of social welfare and economic equality. As the national debate continues, there are growing concerns that the increased financial strain on lower and middle-income families would worsen existing inequities in an already polarized society, expanding the gap between the wealthy and the disadvantaged. Future implications for Argentina’s digital economy As Argentina deals with the fallout from this important leadership transition, the future of digital taxation and its broader implications for content providers and digital entrepreneurs remains unknown. The Milei administration’s response to the outcry against the newly established tax regime will most likely set the tone for how the government balances the urgency of producing income with the urgent need to nurture and cultivate a robust digital economy. Given the vast untapped potential of digital spaces for economic growth, innovation, and creativity, how the new leadership approaches tax policies could either serve to promote a flourishing digital landscape or hinder its development altogether. The national discourse surrounding this contentious issue will undoubtedly have lasting ramifications for the trajectory of Argentina’s economic recovery, influencing everything from individual livelihoods to the country’s overall competitive standing in the global digital arena in the coming years.

Cup And Handle Pattern Shows Why This Is Possible","The Solana price is currently in a massive supply zone after recent declines in the past 48 hours that cut across the entire crypto landscape. Notably, technical analysis suggests that the Solana price is on the way to a massive breakout that would see both its price and market cap surge by over 1,700% in the near future. This analysis is highlighted by a cup and handle formation that has been in play for over two years. According to Solana price analysis shared on social media platform X by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, a bullish cup and handle pattern on Solana’s chart is pointing to a rally to an unprecedented $4,000. Cup And Handle Pattern Signals Bullish Momentum The cup and handle pattern is a classic technical analysis formation often associated with a strong bullish breakout. This pattern, characterized by a rounded bottom (the cup) followed by a smaller dip (the handle), is considered one of the more reliable indicators in technical trading. Related Reading: Weekly Bull Flag Appears On XRP Price Chart, Why A Double-Digit Is Still Feasible In the case of Solana, the development of this pattern has been in action since 2022 through different market cycles. The cup phase began to take shape during the start of the 2022 bear market and extended throughout the entire persistent downtrend. This period also covers the consolidation phase in early 2023 and the rally that took place in the second half of the year. Together, these movements formed the rounded bottom of the cup, with the latter rally highlighted by a break above five successive Fib extension levels. Interestingly, Martinez’s analysis indicates that Solana is currently in the handle phase for the past eight or so months. As it stands, recent price action has seen the Solana price peeking above the neckline of the cup and handle pattern, culminating with the recent all-time high of $263 on November 23. However, the Solana price has been highlighted by a correction phase since reaching this all-time high, with a low of $205 in the past 24 hours. Implications For Solana Price According to technical analysis, the recent all-time high on November 23 coincides with the 1.00 Fibonacci extension level when drawn from the 2022 bear market low of $8, which serves as the lowest point in the cup and handle pattern. Related Reading: This Analyst Correctly Predicted The Bitcoin Flash Crash To $94,000, But There’s A New Target However, the correction that ensued since the all-time high has seen the Solana price retesting the breakout level of neckline for the cup and handle pattern. Such a retest is a common occurrence in cryptocurrency markets, especially after breaking through long-standing resistance levels. With this in mind, Martinez predicted a bounce at the neckline and a resumption of the uptrend. Martinez’s prediction envisions a break above the next four Fib extension levels up until 1.786 Fib extension. If this trajectory were to play out this way, it would drive the Solana price above multiple psychological thresholds, ultimately surpassing $4,000 at the 1.786 extension level., representing a 1,700% increase from the current price of Solana. At the time of writing, Solana is trading at $219.

Over 230 lives were lost, and damages surpassed $53 billion, with entire communities cut off from communication. In this critical moment, World Mobile , a leader in decentralized telecom solutions, stepped in with its AirNodes to restore connectivity in affected areas. How Blockchain Delivered Lifesaving Connectivity After HurricaneHelene #CryptoDaily w/ @WorldMobileTeam https://t.co/gK9v2w57xN — Mario Nawfal (@MarioNawfal) December 10, 2024 World Mobile’s AirNodes – DePIN devices that deliver localized cellular coverage – were the cornerstone of World Mobile’s response. Deployed by Black Hawk helicopter with the assistance of Charles Hoskinson, founder of Ethereum and Cardano, the nodes create coverage zones with a one-mile radius, meaning survivors could make emergency calls, contact loved ones, and access critical resources despite the collapse of traditional communications infrastructure. The success of the initiative depended on the presence of a robust backhaul system, which connects the AirNodes to the broader internet. World Mobile uses various backhaul technologies in everyday situations, including fiber optics and microwave links, but in Helene-hit areas, satellite connectivity was the only available method of backhaul due to widespread damage to the infrastructure. Starlink’s satellite signal was delivered to AirNodes, which then transformed it into cellular coverage, ensuring rapid deployment in areas without functional ground-based infrastructure. This technological flexibility allowed World Mobile to provide connectivity where it was needed most. CEO Micky Watkins explained the company’s commitment to disaster response: “We are committed to supporting communities when they need us the most. The rapid deployment of our DePIN network in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene demonstrates the vital role that innovative connectivity solutions can play in disaster recovery.” The entire deployment process was documented in Connecting the Disconnected, a film premiered by Web3 thought leader Mario Nawful yesterday on X. The documentary showcases the scalability and efficiency of decentralized technology in disaster recovery, emphasizing the life-changing impact of blockchain-powered solutions. While the relief operation demonstrated the humanitarian potential of AirNodes, the technology’s broader application is equally compelling. World Mobile recently surpassed 500,000 daily users, a milestone that reflects the growing adoption of its blockchain-based network. Additionally, recent AirNode sales have been fully sold out, with the last selling out in under three minutes, drawing in operators eager to earn up to $1,000 per month by participating in the decentralized network. The $1.7 trillion telecom industry is plagued by inefficiency, privacy concerns, and outdated models. World Mobile’s decentralized approach addresses these challenges by prioritizing community ownership, transparency, and innovation. The company’s work during Hurricane Helene highlights the potential of technology to transform lives in moments of crisis and beyond, positioning World Mobile as a leader in the next generation of telecom innovation.

37508539,https://blockworks.co/news/solana-tradfi-degen-products,1733929200,Meet the project bringing TradFi’s ‘degen products’ to Solana,"This is a segment from the Lightspeed newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . I was on a Google Meet with Benedikt Schuppli when the co-founder and CEO of Obligate began screen-sharing his email inbox. “Can you see this?,” he asked, pulling up an email from a Swiss bank with a large graphic advertising a 175% participation rate for a financial product. “If this wasn’t a Swiss bank you’d be thinking, ‘Well, that’s obviously some type of scam. Someone’s trying to sell me 175% yield.’” The Swiss bank was offering Schuppli a structured product, a financial instrument that the CEO called the “degen products of TradFi” — and he’s now trying to bring it to crypto with his new startup Margarita Finance. The basic premise of Margarita is that users can easily mix their yield appetite and risk tolerance like a cocktail. Schuppli hopes the project’s blockchain backing can cut out intermediaries that drive up costs and let a new market segment tap into structured products, which offer the sort of risk curve that DeFi users tend to like. Structured products are pre-packaged investments that involve a bond and a call option typically on a basket of assets or an index. Structured products don’t lose their principal investment if the optioned assets fall in value because of the bond’s appreciation in value, so they theoretically present less risk than just trading options. Traditional structured products have lots of middlemen that charge fees, and these fees are passed onto investors, Schuppli said. With Margarita, he said, his team has created a “fully programmable digital asset” that makes fee structures less opaque. Margarita currently lets users invest a minimum of 10 USDC with an option on the price of SOL. Investors can set their preferred yield and maturity date, and they’re then offered a structured product, the return of which depends on if SOL’s price falls below a given barrier. The options are priced by Bermuda-based STS digital and come with a “whole-ass legal documentation” that Schuppli, a lawyer by training, pointed out to me. Margarita Finance is being developed within Obligate, an on-chain bond platform built on Polygon. The goal is to spin Margarita into a DAO once its network and token are launched. Of Obligate’s 15 employees, five are currently working on Margarita. Building Margarita on Solana was much easier than in an Ethereum-compatible environment due to Solana’s token-2022 standard, Schuppli said. Margarita announced $1 million in pre-seed funding two weeks ago, and it is in the process of raising seed funding, Schuppli said. The project also received a grant from the Solana Foundation. Margarita isn’t the first crypto outfit to try out structured products, but it does think it can be the most straightforward to use. “They’ve been very clunky and very technical,” Schuppli said of some other structured product implementations. “DeFi and financial products oftentimes are created by people with a technical bias.” We’ll see if that’s enough of an improvement for Margarita to make onchain structured products a thing — and whether the degen products of TradFi are degen enough for DeFi.

The billionaire investor made the recommendation in a keynote address on December 10 at the Abu Dhabi Finance Week (ADFW). According to Dalio, investing in these hard assets- Bitcoin and gold- will serve as a hedge against economic uncertainty and global debt. While backing Bitcoin and gold, the veteran investor disclosed plans to avoid debt assets, especially bonds. Upcoming Debt Crisis Notably, Dalio predicted that most major economies, such as the U.S. and China, will experience unsustainable debt levels, leading to a future decline in the value of money. In his view, economic debt is among the five key forces capable of impacting the global economy. The other four forces include money, countries’ internal and external political conflicts, the economy, and acts of nature, like natural disasters. The veteran investor encouraged people to focus on the big forces impacting global economies instead of embroiling themselves with insignificant issues. Furthermore, he advocated for a strategic and diversified investment approach in addressing threats and opportunities.Currently, Dalio mentors the committee overseeing Bridgewater Associates' investment strategies. He assumed this role after stepping down as the company’s chairman in 2021. Dalio Engagement with Crypto Dalio was not a fan of crypto in its early days. Notably, in 2020, he expressed skepticism about its long-term success, noting that it would not succeed as many investors anticipated. He also took a swipe at Bitcoin, saying the asset is not an effective medium of exchange. In 2021, Dalio predicted that several countries might ban cryptos due to their risky nature. Interestingly, his views have changed over the years. Two years after criticizing Bitcoin, he urged investors to allocate up to 2% of their portfolio to BTC to hedge against inflation. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is not the only crypto that has captured Dalio's interest.

37508017,https://btc-pulse.com/?p=27694,1733928743,NY Regulator Approves Ripple’s RLUSD Stablecoin,"Ripple’s RLUSD Wins Approval from NYDFS The RLUSD stablecoin offered by Ripple Labs has received its approval from the New York Department of Financial Services, a key regulatory milestone. In a post on X Dec. 10, CEO Brad Garlinghouse said that RLUSD will soon be listed on major exchanges. With the green light from NYDFS, RLUSD is well-placed to take on established players like Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC. RLUSD launched in April to take advantage of Ripple’s knowledge in blockchain and compete for market share in the burgeoning stablecoin market. It has been extensively tested on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum mainnets, and it has forged key partnerships with leading exchanges, such as Bitstamp, Uphold, and Bullish. Targeting Institutional Adoption Ripple’s strategy for RLUSD centers on institutional adoption. Unlike retail-focused stablecoins, RLUSD aims to provide a reliable, regulated option for institutional players. Garlinghouse and Ripple executives project the token could achieve a $2 trillion market capitalization by 2028, reflecting the growing demand for stable, blockchain-based financial instruments. This makes the institutional focus of RLUSD a keystone component of Ripple’s greater ecosystem, supplementing the company’s XRP token and targeting new use cases that range from cross-border payments to corporate treasury solutions. RLUSD Structure and Compatibility with XRP RLUSD will be pegged to the U.S. dollar on a 1:1 basis, collateralized by USD deposits, short-term Treasury bonds, and other high-quality liquid assets. According to Ripple president Monica Long, the stablecoin is “complementary and additive” to XRP, so the two assets work in concert with one another within the ecosystem. This dual-asset strategy will enable Ripple to extend its offerings without diluting the utility of XRP. By aligning RLUSD with institutional needs, Ripple cements its position in the competitive blockchain landscape. The Future Ahead The NYDFS approval now opens new avenues for integrations of RLUSD across exchanges and financial platforms. Ripple is planning to announce further partnerships and listings in the coming weeks, showing the commitment to scale the stablecoin for institutional use. With the continuous and pivotal role of stablecoins in digital finance, the approval of RLUSD represents an important step both for Ripple and the wider blockchain industry.",POSITIVE,USDT | XRP,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | USDT | XRP,,0,0,BTC Pulse,https://btc-pulse.com/ny-regulator-approves-ripples-rlusd-stablecoin/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png

While the risk was immense, the strategy paid off as XRP’s price surged drastically, after the announcement of approval of RLSUD stablecoin. Big Gamble That Paid Off The trade happened on the Rollbit exchange, where the trader used 500x leverage to maximize their position. At the time, XRP was priced at $1.9025. This daring move came with an enormous risk if XRP had dropped below $1.9004, the entire investment would have been wiped out. But luck and timing worked in the trader’s favor. Later the XRP price surged by 26%, following the news that Ripple Labs had secured regulatory approval to launch its RLUSD stablecoin. The trader didn’t wait too long to cash in. As XRP’s price climbed between $2.13 and $2.29, they closed the position gradually, locking in an incredible 7,500% profit.

However, trading at 500x leverage remains an exceptionally risky endeavor, as minor price movements can lead to swift liquidation. XRP Price Update XRP has been on an impressive rally, surging 500% since October.

Dogecoin (DOGE) The Dogecoin price has witnessed a massive rally in the past 30 days that elevated the price levels from the consolidation below $0.1 to levels above $0.45. The 350% jump in its value and a 1000% rise in the trading volume suggest the bulls have entered the ring. This move also increased the market capitalisation of the token from less than a billion to as high as $68.78 billion. However, the token remains at the edge of a major explosion and hence the upcoming rally may push the token into the $100B elite club. As seen in the above chart, the DOGE price is primed for a similar upswing that it experienced in the last 30 days. Meanwhile, the volume has contracted, compelling the price to hover within a narrow range while sustaining the gains. Soon after the BTC price kicks out of consolidation, the DOGE price is expected to break the resistance of the rising parallel channel. Besides, the MACD suggests a continuation of the prevailing consolidation, while the bullish divergence in RSI offers some hope. Therefore, the price is expected to rise and remain consolidated along the average bands until the market breaks out. The upcoming move may not only make Dogecoin a $100B asset but also help the price achieve the $1 milestone. Cardano (ADA) Cardano has always been mesmerized by its price rise, while the token was expected to be dead. After falling from the highs after the 2018 bull run, the price consolidated and triggered a gigantic bull run much before the other tokens in the market in Q1 2021. Interestingly, the token marked its peak in August 2021 above $3, followed by a huge bear market much before the market was triggered. Currently, the price is repeating the previous pattern and if the same outcome materializes, then the ADA price may rise close to a double-digit figure. The monthly chart of Cardano suggests the token is revving a previous pattern. The price is stuck within a range after a notable rise, similar to what occurred in Q4 2020, which triggered over 1700% rise after a breakout. The supertrend has flipped to bullish again after January 2021 and RSI has also marched a rise to the overbought zone for the first time after the previous bull run. However, the dropped volume could be a matter of concern; if the ADA price managed to hold the support, then the token could validate a strong bull run. This move may enable the third-generation token Cardano to achieve the $100B market capitalization, which could push the price close to $10.",POSITIVE,ADA | DOGE | XRP,ADA | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/2-cryptos-set-to-enter-the-100b-elite-club-after-xrp/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png
37507690,https://nulltx.com/?p=135551,1733928000,"Solana, Cardano, JetBolt and Kaspa Soar in Bull Market – Why Are These Altcoins Attracting Crypto Whales?","The crypto bull market is in full swing, and altcoins are making waves as crypto whales pile into high-potential projects. Among the standout performers are Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), JetBolt (JBOLT), and Kaspa (KAS)—each attracting significant attention for unique reasons. As investors hunt for the next big opportunities, these altcoins are gaining traction with innovative technology, robust ecosystems, and strategic adoption. But what makes them stand out, and why could they be perfect choices for this bull market? Dive in to find out. Solana (SOL) takes a dip after nearing all-time high (ATH) Graph showing the price of Solana (SOL) in USD from Coingecko Solana has been one of this year’s outperformers when the bull market commenced. Crypto whales were piling in, pushing SOL to the #5 spot on the crypto leaderboard with a market cap of over $100 billion. After experiencing a price surge following the U.S. election results, Solana has now taken a tumble with the price of SOL dropping by 7.2% over the past 2 weeks. Right now, Solana is down to $216. Some analysts attribute this price decrease to profit-taking from investors following Solana’s impressive rally to an all-time high of $266 in late November. This profit-taking behavior has increased selling pressure, contributing to the recent price decline. Nevertheless, Solana’s current price is still a long way from its all-time low of $0.50 around four and a half years ago. Solana remains one of the strongest contenders in the crypto market, fueled by its scalable infrastructure and booming ecosystem. Institutional interest is surging, with Franklin Templeton’s money market fund recently launched on Solana, marking a milestone for blockchain adoption in traditional finance. Additionally, the filing of Solana ETFs has created significant buzz, signaling potential inflows from institutional investors. Cardano’s regulation-fuelled bullish momentum Cardano (ADA) has been a consistent favorite among crypto whales due to its methodical approach to development and scalability. With the successful rollout of its Hydra upgrade, Cardano has enhanced its transaction speed and efficiency, making it more attractive to developers and users alike. Cardano’s ADA has experienced a 74.9% price hike in the past 30 days, buoyed by a bull market and news that Cardano co-founder Charles Hoskinson has been tapped to guide US lawmakers on crypto regulations under Trump. ADA is now up to a level not seen for over two years, with a $36 billion market cap today. Crypto whales are bullish, with many hoping for Cardano to retest its all-time high of $3.09 soon. JetBolt’s zero-gas revolution prompts whales to snap up tokens JetBolt (JBOLT) is an emerging cryptocurrency built on the Skale Network. It aims to revolutionize crypto payments with a zero gas fee and instant finality ecosystem, with developer and user-friendly infrastructure making it easy to deploy and interact with dApps. JetBolt could shine in transaction-heavy aspects, like GameFi, token creation, NFTs, and more. Beyond its potential to set a new paradigm for transactions, crypto whales have jumped into the JetBolt presale for instant access to its social staking program. Buyers receive immediate custody of tokens in the presale, with daily staking rewards available from the get-go. Plus, users can earn simply by interacting and connecting with friends on the platform. JetBolt also stands at the forefront of innovation by integrating artificial intelligence with Web3. Indeed, JetBolt’s AI-powered market insights tool curates daily news and crypto market updates for its token holders, keeping them updated on this fast moving ecosystem. Since its launch, the JetBolt presale has already sold over 1 million JetBolt tokens. Early adopters have been able to take advantage of daily price increases and discounted pricing through Alpha Box deals, which offer up to 25% more tokens on bulk purchases. Kaspa rises with Kraken listing ahead of new ATH Kaspa is a layer-1 network that uses the GHOSTDAG protocol, a digital ledger that enables parallel blocks to coexist. That makes it one of the world’s fastest and most scalable networks, according to Kaspa’s website. Recently, Kaspa investors were buoyed by news that KAS would be listed on the Kraken exchange, helping the token pump by over 17% in 30 days to $0.162 today. Kaspa’s market cap stands at just above $4 billion, and forecasts see KAS potentially smashing past its $0.207 all-time high soon. Conclusion: The four are bull market titans As the bull market rages on, Solana, Cardano, JetBolt (JBOLT), and Kaspa demonstrate why they’re capturing crypto whales’ attention: speed, innovation, scalability, and vision. JetBolt, in particular, is worth checking out. You can explore more about JetBolt through its presale website: jetbolt.io.

37507637,https://coinpedia.org/?p=391993,1733927919,Top Crypto News Shaping the Ecosystem This Week,"The post Top Crypto News Shaping the Ecosystem This Week appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is always filled with some stories for the community. Some stories give a strong bullish momentum to the market while others shake it with fear. Let’s see what top three crypto news have been buzzing the crypto market in the last week. Bitcoin Jesus: Fighting for His Reputation If you keep an eye on the Bitcoin’s market and non market activities, you definitely have heard the name “ Bitcoin Jesus ”. The person behind this pet name, Roger Ver, is at the center of a legal storm. He was arrested in Spain by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) under multiple federal criminal charges that include tax evasion and mail fraud. As per the DOJ, Bitcoin Jesus underreported his assets and did not reveal his holding of 131k BTC. They say this caused a $48 million tax shortfall. Ver, who was arrested in Spain earlier this year, is pushing back against extradition to the US. But here’s the twist. Ver renounced his US citizenship in 2014, and he’s calling the allegations outdated and based on unclear tax rules. He’s also accusing the DOJ of targeting him not for taxes, but for his outspoken Bitcoin advocacy. Ver’s defense team claims prosecutors misused confidential communications, raising even more questions about the case. The outcome could have huge implications for how governments handle crypto-related tax disputes in the future. MARA Holdings Makes Bold Bitcoin Moves A Bitcoin mining company in North America, Marathon Digital Holdings aka MARA Holdings, Inc, recently bought 11,774 BTC for a total value of $1.1 billion. This means for every bitcoin they paid $96k. With this purchase, MARA now owns 40,435 Bitcoin worth $3.98 billion. Source : X.com The company also hit a major milestone, doubling its mining capacity to 50 EH/s. Despite these achievements, MARA’s stock dipped 4.4% this week and is slightly down for 2024. Even so, CEO Fred Thiel sounds optimistic. He’s hinting at more expansions, which could set the tone for the entire mining industry. Ripple’s Stablecoin Gets a Green Light Ripple isn’t holding back either. Its RLUSD stablecoin has just been approved by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced plans to list the stablecoin on major exchanges soon. This could be a game-changer. RLUSD, first introduced in April, is Ripple’s answer to Tether and USD Coin. The stablecoin has been tested on both the XRP ledger and Ethereum mainnets. With NYDFS approval, Ripple is positioning itself in a stablecoin market that could grow from $207 billion to $2 trillion in the next few years. It’s a bold move that might shake up the competition. What to Expect All these events in just a week shows how unpredictable and dynamic the crypto world can be. The case of “Bitcoin Jesus” might give a new turn to how crypto laws are enforced. MARA holdings might inspire other mining companies to step in and RLUSD might define the stablecoin world. Well, there are new things in the crypto world everyday.

37507610,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=374325,1733927860,Bitcoin Price Analysis: Is BTC Finally Ready to Conquer $100K After Recent Corrections?,"Bitcoin’s price is still struggling to rise above the $100K level after just wicking above it last week. Yet, the market structure indicates that it could only be a matter of time. Technical Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, the price has been gradually climbing over the last few weeks as the market has slowed down following the breakout above the $90K level. Yet, while BTC briefly traded above $100K last week, it has not been able to continue higher or stay above this level. Meanwhile, as the market structure remains bullish and the RSI clearly shows bullish momentum, it is likely that Bitcoin will break out higher soon. The 4-Hour Chart Looking at the 4-hour chart, the asset has been making higher highs and lows over the past few weeks, forming a rather narrow ascending channel. Currently, the market is getting supported at the lower boundary of the pattern, which could lead to a rally toward the higher trendline and values bigger than $100K in the coming weeks. On the other hand, if the lower boundary of the pattern is broken, a drop toward the $90K support zone could be expected. Yet, looking at how things stand right now, the bearish scenario is less likely. On-Chain Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) Funding Rates While Bitcoin’s price is slowly rising toward the $100K level again, and probably higher, futures market traders should be over the moon with optimism. However, last week’s quick rise above the $100K level and the flash crash afterward have cooled down the futures market sentiment significantly. This chart presents the funding rates metric, which is a good proxy for futures market sentiment. It shows whether the buyers or the sellers are more dominant and aggressive in executing their orders. Typically, positive values are associated with bullish sentiment and vice versa. While Bitcoin’s aggregate funding rates massively spiked last week, the huge volatility on the day BTC finally reached $100K led to significant liquidations. As a result, funding rates have returned back to normal values for a bull run, which could lead to a more sustainable rally in the upcoming weeks.

37507707,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=626005,1733927630,European Central Bank heads for last rate cut of year – Here’s what’s on the table,"The European Central Bank (ECB) is poised to announce its last interest rate cut of the year on December 12. Analysts expect the cuts will be modest, at 25 basis points, down from earlier speculation of a larger 50-basis-point move. CNBC’s latest report shows the ECB staff will meet this week to unveil its quarterly macroeconomic projections and announce interest rate cuts. Economists predict the pace of monetary easing could accelerate in the coming months. These forecasts are expected to account for the unpredictable global implications of Donald Trump’s return to the U.S. presidency and his proposed trade tariffs, which could have far-reaching effects on the eurozone. A year of gradual cuts Over the course of 2024, the ECB has reduced its key interest rate by 75 basis points, bringing it from 4% in June to 3.25% in October through three consecutive 25-basis-point cuts. According to reports , Eurozone inflation eased in August to its lowest level in three years, falling to 2.2% from 2.6% in July. The European Central Bank also noted that labor cost pressures were easing, with corporate profits helping to absorb the effects of rising wages on inflation. However, at the time, the ECB acknowledged that financing conditions remained tight, contributing to subdued private consumption and weak investment across the bloc. Earlier discussions hinted at the possibility of a more aggressive 50-basis-point reduction to close out the year, particularly given declining inflation and a weakening economic outlook in the euro area. However, recent economic indicators and monetary policy trends have tempered these expectations. Money markets currently suggest a limited chance of a substantial cut, with pricing on Wednesday reflecting an anticipated 29 basis points in reductions for December. Economists have pointed to rising negotiated wages in November as a cautionary signal, suggesting the ECB may prefer a more measured approach. Per CNBC, headline inflation in the eurozone ticked up to 2.3% in November from 2% the previous month, marginally exceeding the ECB’s target. Meanwhile, economic growth in the bloc accelerated at its fastest pace in two years during the third quarter, albeit at a modest rate of 0.4%. Eurozone seeks to balance inflation and growth Sylvain Broyer, chief EMEA economist at S&P Global Ratings, anticipates a 25-basis-point cut this month, reflecting a cautious stance as inflation remains relatively contained in the short term. Speaking to CNBC, Broyer emphasized that labor cost increases surpassing productivity growth could compel the ECB to maintain vigilance on inflationary pressures. “There is no need to hurry up at this stage for the ECB,” Broyer said. “Inflation, at least over the short term, is under control. But as long as labor costs increase above productivity, the ECB should remain on the cautious side, or on the wait-and-see side for cutting rates.” Broyer predicts a quicker succession of rate reductions in 2025 as the ECB seeks to achieve a neutral monetary policy stance—neither restrictive nor stimulative to growth. Moreover, revised projections from Bank of America Global Research suggest an accelerated pace of rate cuts next year. The bank now expects the ECB’s deposit facility rate to drop to 1.5% by September 2025, down from an earlier estimate of 2% by mid-year. “ With an economy that will be growing at or below trend for most of 2025, we think it will be hard for the ECB to skip a meeting until the [deposit facility] falls slightly below where it sees the neutral rate (2%), to where we see it (1.5%), ” Bank of America strategists wrote in a recently released statement. Political and geopolitical challenges The ECB’s decisions are unfolding against a backdrop of political and economic uncertainty, particularly in key economies like Germany and France. Rising bond yields in these countries are compounding the challenges for policymakers. Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro research at ING, noted that political instability in Europe’s largest economies could create additional headwinds for the eurozone. Speaking at an event last week, Brzeski pointed out that while Southern European economies are benefiting from a post-pandemic tourism resurgence, Germany and France face potential political gridlock in the first half of 2025. Compounding these challenges is Trump’s economic agenda in the US, which could divert investment from Europe through tax cuts, deregulation, and other incentives. Brzeski cautioned that such policies might pose a greater threat to the eurozone than the specter of trade tariffs. “ The first half of the year is also going to be a standstill politically in Germany and France,” Brzeski said . “Southern European economies will continue to benefit from a post-pandemic tourism boom, and they don’t need to compete with Chinese manufacturing. But the eurozone faces significant uncertainty regarding external shocks. ” Despite near-term challenges, some analysts see room for optimism. Rising real incomes and savings could provide a delayed boost to eurozone growth, supporting the economy through 2025. However, Brzeski warned that downside risks exist, including the possibility of Europe implementing its own protectionist measures in reaction to US policy, which may worsen global trade tensions.

NYDFS Approves Ripple Stablecoin Ripple Labs has received final approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to launch its stablecoin, RLUSD. The announcement was made by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse via X (formerly Twitter) on Tuesday, marking a significant milestone for the company. Ripple’s progress with RLUSD and broader initiatives signals the company’s growing influence in the digital asset space.

Ripple's stablecoin aims to challenge the dominance of Circle’s USDC in the US market. USDC is currently the second-largest stablecoin globally, with a market capitalization of $40 billion, trailing only Tether. The RLUSD stablecoin has undergone extensive testing on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum networks and is poised for listings on major crypto exchanges. Ripple’s president, Monica Long, previously highlighted that RLUSD would serve as a complementary asset to XRP, targeting large institutional players. Ripple’s Rising Momentum Ripple Labs has seen a surge in momentum in recent months, emerging stronger from its prolonged legal battle with the SEC. Its native cryptocurrency, XRP, now ranks as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency globally by market capitalization, with its value appreciating significantly. XRP has gained over 200% in the past 30 days, reflecting its growing acceptance and utility. Ripple’s advancements extend beyond its stablecoin. The XRP Ledger has gained traction globally, especially in BRICS countries like India and Russia. Notably, the Russian government recently enacted legislation recognizing XRP and other cryptocurrencies, while India’s Reserve Bank announced a partnership with Ripple Labs for its virtual Rupee initiative. Partnerships and Future Projections Ripple has established strategic partnerships to bolster RLUSD adoption, including collaborations with Uphold, Bitstamp, Bitso, MoonPay, Independent Reserve, CoinMENA, and Bullish. Executives at Ripple speculate that RLUSD could achieve a market capitalization of $2 trillion by 2028. As the stablecoin prepares for its debut, its entry into New York, a global financial hub, is expected to further Ripple's penetration in the institutional finance sector. The approval is anticipated to positively impact XRP prices, which are currently trading at $2.36. With the holiday season approaching, investor sentiment around XRP remains optimistic, with projections suggesting the cryptocurrency could approach the $3 mark by year-end.

The market cap stands at $128.53 billion, signaling strong investor interest. Analysts caution about euphoria-driven profit-taking by retail investors. XRP’s social dominance reached 5.65% during the broader market slump, showing increased community interest and activity. According to LunarCrush , the token saw an impressive price surge of over 320% in the last three months, reaching a market cap of $128.53 billion. While this growth is encouraging, analysts recommend restraint. XRP’s impressive price surge sparked discussions on platforms like Twitter, where market commentators are highlighting both opportunities and risks. One analyst said retail investors often trigger price spikes but are equally quick to sell off during profit-taking phases . This highlights the importance of strategic profit-taking in such volatile conditions. “You can hate me all you want but when retail pumps a coin you can expect them to be just as quick with selling.

The cryptocurrency is up marginally over the past 24 hours, trading around the $97,500 mark. The decline comes shortly after the markets witnessed $1.5 billion in liquidations, impacting over 500,000 traders. BTC’s sudden drop also significantly impacted the rest of the market, with the total market capitalization shrinking by over 7%. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) continued to trade in the red, with the price marginally down at $3,660. Ripple (XRP) has recovered from its recent drop, with the price up almost 8% and trading at $2.33. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable declines. Meanwhile, Tron (TRX) , Cardano (ADA), Toncoin (TON), Stellar (XLM) , and Uniswap (UNI) registered notable increases. Google Unveils New Quantum Chip. Can It Crack Bitcoin? Google has just announced its latest supercomputer chip, Willow. Willow can perform computations that would take today's supercomputers years in minutes. The chip garnered significant attention from the crypto community, which discussed its ability to crack secure blockchain networks and render the security of public key cryptography useless. The chip has led to considerable anxiety in some sections of the Bitcoin community, thanks to its potential to compromise Bitcoin’s security and cryptographic techniques. Willow boasts 105 qubits and an astonishing ability to minimize computational errors. According to a Google post, it can perform a benchmark test in under five minutes, a task that would take today’s supercomputers around 10 septillion years to complete. The crypto community has mixed views about Willow and its potential to impact BTC and crypto. Some feel the technology could end encryption and crack Bitcoin. On the other hand, most of the community believes Willow has several shortcomings when tested with Bitcoin’s security. Bitcoin advocate Ben Sigman pointed out that BTC uses two types of encryption: The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) and the SHA-256 secure hashtag algorithm. Sigman pointed out that both encryptions require millions of qubits to break through, meaning Willow, with 105 qubits, is far from cracking Bitcoin’s encryption. “Q: Can Google's Willow crack Bitcoin? Estimates indicate that compromising Bitcoin's encryption would necessitate a quantum computer with approximately 13 million qubits to achieve decryption within 24 hours. In contrast, Google's Willow chip, while a significant advancement, comprises 105 qubits. We have a ways to go... Nonetheless, this is a remarkable leap forward in quantum computing.” Others pointed out that crypto should be the least of worries if Willow or similarly capable chips can break encryption standards, stating, “If quantum computing breaks encryption, crypto would be the least of your worries. It will - expose government & military secrets - exploit banking systems - and turn private chats public, but Google's Willow is at 105 qubits. Breaking bitcoin needs 13 million qubits - still a long way.” Microsoft Shareholders Reject Bitcoin Reserve Microsoft shareholders voted against a resolution to add Bitcoin (BTC) to the company’s balance sheets. The resolution was proposed by The National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), a think-tank based in Washington DC framing it as a corporate duty to provide value to shareholders through profit diversification. The NCPPR submitted a video outlining the proposal that played during the meeting. The video, peppered with charts and figures, discussed BTC’s potential and the advantages of adding it to the company’s balance sheets. “The institutional and corporate adoption of Bitcoin is becoming more commonplace. Microsoft’s second-largest shareholder, BlackRock, offers its clients a Bitcoin ETF.” The proposal also discussed BTC’s volatility, stating it was more volatile than corporate bonds, and advised against holding too much of the asset. However, it advised against ignoring Bitcoin altogether. “As the proposal itself notes, volatility is a factor to consider in evaluating cryptocurrency investments for corporate treasury applications that require stable and predictable investments to ensure liquidity and operational funding.” Trump To Make Bitcoin (BTC) A Central Focus President-elect Donald Trump will make Bitcoin (BTC) a central focus of his administration as he aims to push its price to $150,000. According to sources from Trump’s transition team, the president-elect views BTC as another stock market and anticipates a potential price surge to $150,000 early in his term. Trump’s interest in BTC and crypto is part of a broader initiative to position the US as the global leader in crypto and other emerging technologies. David Sacks, a former PayPal executive, has been appointed as the White House AI and Crypto Czar and tasked with creating a clear regulatory framework for the industry. The incoming administration hopes to promote regulations that provide clarity for crypto and crypto businesses while fostering innovation. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) fell sharply at the beginning of the week as sellers drove the price to a low of $94,177. While it has recovered from this level, BTC is still struggling to get back above $98,000, a level where sellers are active. BTC and the crypto market hit a significant bump over the past few days. Prices crashed abruptly, shaving off billions in value, with the crypto market cap dropping over 8% in 24 hours. Despite dropping significantly on Monday, BTC made an impressive recovery and has weathered the storm well, but the same cannot be said about other altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL). The crash was due to high leverage, liquidity issues, and market weakness. The market selloff began with aggressive selling on Coinbase as traders started offloading their assets an hour before the crash began. The selling pressure gradually pushed BTC into a liquidation cascade. Looking at the price chart, we can see BTC’s momentum waning as it entered the current week. BTC rebounded from an intraday low of $93,665 on Tuesday, registering an increase of almost 3% on Wednesday and settling at $98,581. BTC experienced significant volatility on Thursday, creating history by moving past the $100,000 mark and setting a new all-time high of $103,900. However, buyers lost momentum after reaching this level, and BTC crashed to a low of $92,285, briefly dipping below the 20-day SMA. BTC recovered from this level to go above $95,000 and settle at $97,023, ultimately registering a decline of 1.51%. Source: TradingView BTC recovered on Friday as it rose by almost 3%, reaching a high of $101,913 before settling at $99,695. Buyers maintained control on Saturday as BTC registered a marginal increase before climbing above $100,000 again on Sunday and settling at $101,043. Markets suffered a dramatic collapse on Monday, and BTC plummeted to an intraday low of $94,177 before settling at $97,434, ultimately registering a drop of almost 4%. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as BTC registered a marginal drop to settle at $96,914 after recovering from an intraday low of $94,307. The current session sees BTC up almost 1% as buyers look to reclaim $98,000 and push toward $100,000. BTC is facing immediate resistance at $98,000. If buyers can go above this level, BTC will look to retest $100,000. On the other hand, a drop could drop BTC to $95,000. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) is looking to recover after facing a substantial drop at the beginning of the current week as sellers attempted to drag it below $3,500. ETH was quite bullish last week as it rebounded from a low of $3,504, registering an increase of over 6% on Wednesday to go past $3,700 and settle at $3,844. Sellers attempted to drive ETH below $3,500 on Thursday as it fell to an intraday low of $3,644. However, buyers propped up the price from this level, and ETH ultimately settled at $3,787 after a decline of 1.48%. Despite considerable bearish sentiment and volatility, ETH recovered on Friday, registering an increase of almost 6% to go above $4,000 and settling at $4,003 after reaching an intraday high of $4,093. Source: TradingView With sellers active at this level, momentum waned over the weekend, as ETH registered a marginal drop on Saturday before rising by 0.19% on Sunday to reclaim $4,000 and settle at $4,007. With the markets suffering a sudden crash on Monday, ETH collapsed, falling to an intraday low of $3,504 and slipping below the 20-day SMA. However, it found support at this level and recovered to climb above the 20-day SMA and settle at $3,716, registering a drop of over 7%. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as they attempted to drive ETH below the 20-day SMA. As a result, the price fell to a low of $3,519 before settling at $3,630. The current session sees ETH up over 1% as buyers look to reclaim $3,700 and push towards $4,000. On the other hand, if sellers regain control and drive ETH below $3,500, it could fall as low as $3,200. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) is attempting a recovery as it rebounds from its support levels and counter growing selling pressure. SOL is struggling to go above the 20-day SMA, which acted as a dynamic level of resistance and prevented a move past $240. After dropping to an intraday low of $219 on Monday, SOL made a strong recovery on Tuesday, rising almost 4% from a low of $215 to settle at $234. Sellers regained control on Wednesday, driving SOL down nearly 2% to $229. The price rebounded on Thursday despite facing significant volatility, registering an increase of 2.84% and settling at $236 after rising to an intraday high of $244 and dropping to an intraday low of $221. Source: TradingView Buyers retained control on Friday as SOL rose to an intraday high of $246. However, it could not stay at this level and dropped below $240 to settle at $237, registering only a marginal increase. The weekend was mixed for SOL as it registered a marginal rise on Saturday and a slight decrease on Sunday to end the weekend at $237. Selling pressure increased substantially on Monday as SOL dropped to an intraday low of $205 as sellers attempted to drive the price below $200. However, SOL made somewhat of a recovery and climbed above the 50-day SMA to settle at $216 after a drop of almost 9%. Selling pressure persisted on Tuesday as SOL fell to $213 after a fall of 1.47%. The current session sees SOL up nearly 3% as buyers look to reclaim $220 and begin a push towards the 20-day SMA. Dogwifhat (WIF) Price Analysis Dogwifhat (WIF) experienced a significant rally last week, surging past the resistance at $3.50 and briefly surpassing $4 before retreating. WIF recovered from an intraday low of $2.99 to register an increase of over 5% on Tuesday. However, it could not move above the 20-day SMA and fell back on Wednesday, dropping almost 3% and settling at $3.19. Sellers drove WIF to an intraday low of $3.04 on Thursday as selling pressure persisted. However, WIF recovered from this level to register an increase of almost 5% to go above the 20-day SMA and settle at $3.35. Buyers retained control on Friday as WIF rose by 4.07% and settled at $3.48, testing the resistance at $3.50. Source: TradingView WIF rallied impressively on Saturday as it surged past the resistance at $3.50 after an increase of over 11% and settled at $3.87. WIF attempted to go above $4 but lost momentum. As a result, it fell on Sunday, dropping 3.68% to $3.73. Bearish sentiment intensified significantly on Monday as WIF dropped over 18% to go below the 20-day SMA and settle at $3.05. Sellers retained control on Tuesday and drove WIF below $3 and the 50-day SMA to $2.84 after a drop of 6.69%. The current session sees WIF up by 2.35% as buyers look to reclaim $3 and push the price above the 50-day SMA. Cardano (ADA) Price Analysis Cardano (ADA) has been facing considerable selling pressure since last week as sentiment changed to bearish after it reached an intraday high of $1.32 last Tuesday. ADA declined marginally after reaching this level and continued to drop on Wednesday, dropping 0.50% after experiencing considerable volatility. Selling pressure and volatility registered an uptick on Thursday as ADA fell after reaching an intraday high of $1.24, eventually settling at $1.16 after a drop of 2.27%. ADA recovered on Friday, rising almost 6% and settling at $1.22 but fell back in the red over the weekend, dropping by 1.38% on Saturday and 1.40% on Sunday to settle at $1.19. Source: TradingView Bearish sentiment intensified substantially on Monday as markets witnessed a selloff. As a result, ADA plummeted almost 16%, going below the 20-day SMA and falling to an intraday low of $0.91 before recovering to reclaim $1. Sellers made another attempt to drag ADA lower as it fell to a low of $0.91 on Tuesday. However, it recovered from this level to register an increase of 1.69% and settle at $1.02. The current session sees ADA marginally down as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. Aptos (APT) Price Analysis Aptos (APT) started the previous week on a bullish note, reaching a high of $14.75 on Tuesday. However, sentiment changed on Wednesday as selling pressure and volatility registered a considerable increase. As a result, APT fell almost 3% to $14.13. Selling pressure persisted on Thursday as sellers drove APT to a low of $13.08. However, it recovered from this level to settle at $13.62, ultimately registering a decline of 3.59%. Despite considerable selling pressure, APT registered a sharp increase on Friday, rising almost 8% and settling at $14.68 as buyers attempted to overwhelm the resistance at $14.50. Source: TradingView APT surged to an intraday high of $15.37 on Saturday. However, buyers lost momentum after reaching this level, and the price fell to register a marginal decline and settle at $14.58. Selling pressure persisted as the price dropped marginally on Sunday, ending the weekend at $14.54. Bearish sentiment intensified considerably on Monday as APT plummeted almost 18% to slip below the 20-day SMA and the $13 support level to settle at $11.97, but not after hitting an intraday low of $10.49. Bearish sentiment persisted on Tuesday as APT briefly slipped below the 50-day SMA before recovering to settle at $11.64, ultimately registering a drop of 2.76%. The current session sees APT marginally up as buyers look to reclaim $12 and push toward the 20-day SMA. Fantom (FTM) Price Analysis Fantom (FTM) started the previous week on a bullish note, surging almost 14% and settling at $1.24. Despite a strong start to the week, FTM fell back into the red on Tuesday after considerable volatility. FTM ultimately registered a marginal drop to remain at $1.24. Buyers attempted to go above the resistance at $1.30 on Wednesday as FTM reached an intraday high of $1.29. However, buyers lost momentum after reaching this level, and the price fell back, dropping 2.41% and settling at $1.21. Buying activity picked up on Thursday as FTM rose 8% to move above $1.30 and settled at $1.31. Sellers attempted to drag the price below $1.30 on Friday. However, buyers prevented a decline, and FTM registered only a marginal drop to remain above $1.30. Source: TradingView Buyers regained control over the weekend as FTM registered a marginal increase on Saturday before rising by 1.12% on Sunday to settle at $1.33.

37507314,https://coinpedia.org/?p=391859,1733927174,Why DogLibre Chose Crowdsale over Fair Launch: Prioritizing the Community,"The post Why DogLibre Chose Crowdsale over Fair Launch: Prioritizing the Community appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News When it comes to launching tokens, the crypto world often debates between fair launches and crowdsales. DogLibre chose the crowdsale approach, defying trends in the meme token space. While fair launches have their merits, DogLibre’s guiding principle is that the community comes first . This choice reflects their commitment to creating a sustainable and impactful ecosystem for dog lovers and crypto enthusiasts worldwide. A Global Context: Dogs, Crypto, and the Challenges They Face Here are some striking statistics: Nearly 30% of households worldwide share their lives with one of Earth’s estimated 700 million to 1 billion dogs . Approximately 562 million people own crypto, forming a rapidly growing global community. But alongside these positives lies a stark reality: In the UK , over 1.2 million dogs are euthanized annually . In the US , 7.6 million pets are abandoned in shelters yearly, with nearly 1 million dogs . These numbers are only worsening and highlight the urgency of DogLibre.’ What Is a Fair Launch? A fair launch is a token distribution method that gives everyone equal access—no presales, insider allocations, or early access. Theoretically, this ensures a level playing field, with tokens available at the same price, time, and quantity for all participants. While this sounds ideal, the reality often needs to be improved. Fair launches are frequently undermined by whales and bots : Whales who purchase large amounts of tokens consolidate ownership. Bots are programmed to execute trades instantly, leaving everyday investors at a disadvantage. The result? Instead of fostering decentralization, fair launches often lead to price volatility , manipulation , and centralized control , contrary to their intended purpose. Unfortunately, many projects find they are nothing but playgrounds for opportunists rather than a way to build genuine community engagement. Why DogLibre Chose Crowdsale Over Fair Launch So, again, while the concept of a fair launch aligns itself with the idea of equal opportunity, it doesn’t always support the long-term growth and health of a project or startup. At DogLibre, the team has observed in detail how fair launches can frequently lead to volatility and centralization of token ownership. For this reason, they’ve listed the following arguments on why they are not right for their project’s community-driven approach. Avoiding Whale Domination: DogLibre doesn’t want a handful of whales or opportunistic investors controlling the $DOGL token. That would go against its goal of building a community-centric ecosystem where each member has a voice. Protecting the Community: Fair launches can inadvertently leave retail investors vulnerable to price manipulation. The structured crowdsale ensures a foundation prioritizing fairness and transparency. Building a Strong Foundation : Crowdsales allows us to create a more balanced distribution of tokens, ensuring that $DOGL ownership remains decentralized and genuinely representative of its growing community. Crowdsales Are All About You—The Community DogLibre has said their decision to launch a crowdsale had nothing to do with raising massive funds or getting venture capitalists involved in their genuinely community-based project. “We’ve intentionally avoided VC funding to stay true to our values,” said Lee Lin Liew, Project Lead of DogLibre. “The crowdsale is our way to ensure we prioritize the people who believe in DogLibre’s mission and want to be part of its long-term journey. Here’s how its crowdsale benefits the community: Decentralized Ownership: Making tokens accessible to everyone in the community ensures a healthy and balanced token economy that is resilient against market manipulation. Transparent and Inclusive: DogLibre’s crowd sale process was designed to be simple and open, allowing anyone to participate without worrying about being left out by insiders. Empowering the Community: Unlike traditional fundraising models, DogLibre´s focus isn’t on attracting VCs but on growing alongside a community that shares the vision and mission of using blockchain technology to make a real-world impact on stray and pet dogs. Sustainable Growth: Crowdsales allow DogLibre to build DogLibre at a measured and sustainable pace, ensuring that its roadmap and token utility evolve to benefit the community first. DogLibre Is Not Just Another Memecoin? At DogLibre, they’re not just another meme project chasing short-term hype, and, believe us, there are thousands of them out there—over 2,000, to be more precise, according to global research . Unlike over 90% of all other memecoins, its mission is rooted in creating real-world utility through AI, IoT, gaming, dynamic NFTs, and even DePIN—all aimed at improving the lives of dogs globally while creating value for its token holders. Choosing the crowdsale method over Fair Launch is DogLibre’s way of saying they’re here for the long run. They decided to bank on community growth and trust, align with it’s values, and build a remarkable token that’s more than just fun and engaging—it’s about effecting change for the millions of beautiful, cute dogs, improving people’s lives, and for those of us who love them. About DogLibre DogLibre is a groundbreaking ecosystem combining advanced technology with real-world solutions to transform dog welfare. Backed by industry trailblazers, DogLibre empowers a global community, uniting people to create lasting, impactful change for stray and pet dogs everywhere.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/information/why-doglibre-chose-crowdsale-over-fair-launch-prioritizing-the-community/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

While Dogecoin is in a recovery phase, it is still within the $0.39 region. Analysts are warning investors to seize the window to purchase the meme coin before it goes parabolic again.Technical analyst Crypto Scofield expressed this sentiment in a post on X. He warned the community that this may be their last chance to buy Dogecoin before it takes off again. According to him, missing this opportunity could mean missing out on major pumps that have historically followed Dogecoin's dips.Notably, before Dogecoin reached its current position, it traded as low as $0.089 in September and $0.1015 in October. However, Dogecoin spent most of November breaking higher levels not seen since 2021 before losing momentum at $0.4835 in December.Investors who joined Dogecoin before the pump benefited from a streak of green candles. While Dogecoin's price has since dropped by 24% from its multi-year peak, analysts continue to urge investors to seize the opportunity to buy Dogecoin at a discount before the next wave.Commentators like Crypto Scofield are targeting a $3 price for Dogecoin in the near-term outlook.Dogecoin Set-up Shows Attractive Risk-Reward RatioOther analysts have similarly voiced bullish sentiments on Dogecoin amid the recent dip. According to analyst Rose, Dogecoin's current setup offers an attractive risk-reward ratio for long-term holders.This analyst called for a long position on Dogecoin, urging market participants to take profits once the asset reaches $0.70, around where it peaked in the last cycle, and $0.9977, which would mark an unprecedented price territory for DOGE.Meanwhile, the analyst cautioned that if the bearish trend continues, holders should consider closing their long positions at $0.32 to minimize risk.In a separate commentary, analyst Kriss Pax assured market participants that there is nothing wrong with Dogecoin. He stated that while Dogecoin has been in a period of sideways price action for about a month, there is nothing fundamentally wrong with it, and it will soon resume its bull run. Dogecoin chart by Kriss Pax Prominent analysts like Ali Martinez have argued for a potential 4,400% run in Dogecoin to $18 post-dip .

37509155,https://cryptonews.com/?p=318665,1733926696,Bitget Eyes Lithuania for EU Regional Hub Amid MiCA Compliance Plans,"Bitget , a cryptocurrency exchange and a Web3 company, has announced plans to establish a European Union regional hub in Lithuania. The decision is part of its strategic expansion across Europe and its proactive measures to align with the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework, which will be fully compliant by the end of December. MiCA Framework Attracting Crypto Exchanges to EU The company plans to establish a regional office and hire compliance and operations personnel to ensure its activities fully adhere to the MiCA framework. This decision follows Bitget’s recent acquisition of a crypto registration in Lithuania, which is part of its commitment to operating securely and transparently within the EU. “We truly appreciate EU regulatory authorities for their leadership and vision for nurturing a secure and vibrant environment for digital innovation,” Bitget’s Chief Legal Officer Hon Ng said. Hon Ng highlighted that the company’s ambitions in Europe extend beyond mere business growth. He said it also supports the region’s burgeoning ecosystem of crypto startups and innovation. Bitget’s Regulatory Commitment and Global Expansion Bitget’s move into Lithuania aligns with its broader compliance strategy and expansion into crypto-friendly jurisdictions. The exchange has already secured licenses in major markets, including Poland, Australia, and Italy, and has recently re-entered the UK market with fully compliant crypto services. The company is actively pursuing regulatory approvals in over 15 jurisdictions worldwide. As the MiCA framework comes into full effect, Bitget plans to collaborate closely with European regulators to ensure its products and services meet all necessary standards. This collaboration will prioritize user asset protection and data security, allowing the exchange to maintain reliability and compliance. Hon Ng described the establishment of the Lithuanian hub as a significant step toward Bitget’s goal of becoming the fastest-growing compliant exchange under MiCA. Bitget is not only expanding into Europe. Earlier this year, a report indicated that Bitget is also prioritizing its expansion into India , actively engaging with regulators to ensure compliance with licensing requirements. The exchange labeled India a “high-priority market.” Bitget aims to capitalize on the country’s rapid crypto adoption and growing Web3 potential, driven by its tech-savvy population and skilled workforce. Bitget’s efforts come amid regulatory crackdowns on non-compliant exchanges like Binance and Kraken in India. These strategic expansions have contributed to Bitget’s growth. According to a September report, Bitget tripled its global registered user base to surpass 45 million users , marking a 400% increase since 2023. Source: Cryptonews This milestone positions Bitget today as the sixth-largest crypto exchange by trading volume. Growth has been particularly notable in Africa (1,614%), South Asia (729%), and Southeast Asia (216%) in 2024, supported by initiatives like TON projects and smart crypto solutions. Notably, Last month, Bitget also integrated VietQR , a Vietnamese payment system enabling real-time digital transactions, to allow users to transfer Vietnamese Dong (VND) seamlessly. This move enables VND deposits and withdrawals through VietQR and facilitates the purchase of cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, USDT, SOL, and BGB. Bitget also launched a campaign offering transaction fee rebates and trading bonuses to incentivize user participation, targeting up to 1,000 participants.

37507335,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=625949,1733926563,Wall Street is confident about Trump – Here’s why,"Wall Street advisers are predicting the Trump economy to lead a surge in business activities come 2025. They expecct loosening regulatory controls to boost mergers and acquisitions (M&A) alongside stock market debuts. The shift is attributed to President-elect Donald Trump’s vows throughout his presidential campaign, which foreshadowed a less strict regulatory environment that might boost company activity and investor confidence in the next year. Christina Minnis, head of global credit finance and acquisitions at Goldman Sachs, told attendees at Bloomberg’s Women, Money and Power conference in London that there is a growing sense of optimism surrounding M&A activity in the United States. “ I think there’s probably a sentiment that M&A activity in the US might be slightly more robust, ” Minnis said, referring to Trump’s policy proposals that promise a friendlier environment for corporate transactions. Minnis believes the market sentiment has been especially apparent since the election, with an increase in inquiries from sponsors and corporate clients who had been previously hesitant due to regulatory uncertainties. For $1 billion, Donald Trump is now promising to exempt businesses from government regulations — including environmental and safety requirements. pic.twitter.com/djEBKaBy0j — Max Burns (@themaxburns) December 10, 2024 Despite this optimism in the US, the Goldman Sachs credit finance head cautioned that European markets may experience a more cautious approach due to concerns over tariffs that the US might potentially impose. However, she remains confident that the summer months will see a general uptick in global deal activity as markets adjust to the new political landscape. Analysts optimistic about Trump’s policies and proposed regulatory changes Alison Harding-Jones, Deutsche Bank’s global head of M&A, echoed Minnis’s sentiment, highlighting the change in regulatory climate expected under Trump’s administration. She noted that under Biden’s administration, the regulatory process often dragged on for years, with some deals stalling entirely as watchdogs examined every detail. “ The mindset is the US has definitely been much more difficult under Biden, and that will change and get better, ” Harding-Jones said. Simona Maellare, global co-head of the alternative capital group at UBS, also sees a shift in the market dynamics. She stated that private equity firms, which have been sitting on trillions of dollars in unspent capital, are likely to take advantage of the new regulatory environment . “ What has prevented deals in the past was this bid-ask on valuations, ” Maellare explained. “… But the economics don’t work like that. If they’re not encouraged, if they don’t make the returns, they really can’t do it .” The relaxation of regulatory constraints could offer these firms an ideal scenario for deploying their capital in a more favorable environment. In Europe, the change in US leadership could spur consolidation within the region’s banking industry, which has struggled to keep pace with the US sector since the financial crisis. Moreover, Harding-Jones pointed out that while there has been some uptick in acquisitions by European lenders, most deals have been limited to domestic transactions. A more relaxed regulatory environment in the US could prompt European regulators to move forward with the much-discussed banking union, long considered a key goal for the region’s lawmakers. The crypto industry poised to thrive under Trump’s administration Alongside traditional industries, the crypto sector is also set to benefit from the expected shift in regulatory dynamics. With President-elect Trump’s promises of a more favorable regulatory regime for digital assets, crypto-native firms are likely to see accelerated growth. 🚨BREAKING: Eric Trump confirms President Trump’s plan to make American cryptocurrencies such as $XRP $XLM $BTC and $ETH tax free I was the first public source of this story and reported on it.

DM to setup your qfs pic.twitter.com/AXus9gV3Fq — Official Bo Polny (@BoPolnysays) December 11, 2024 Industry experts believe that the loosening of regulatory restrictions will benefit companies like Coinbase Global Inc., the largest US crypto exchange, whose stock surged following the election results. Per a recent Bloomberg report , private crypto firms are also benefiting from the expected change, with Ripple Labs seeing a 72% increase in shares traded on secondary markets. Crypto firms face competition from TradFi players For years, many established financial institutions have avoided the crypto space due to regulatory uncertainty. However, as the regulatory environment becomes more transparent under Trump, major players like State Street, JPMorgan Chase, BNY Mellon, and Bank of America are expected to delve deeper into the digital currency sector, offering services such as digital asset custody and trading. “As we look into 2025 and 2026, we are going to see a tremendous amount of interest from the TradFi players to get more involved in the crypto space,” Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association, told Bloomberg. Coinbase CFO Alesia Haas acknowledged the challenges posed by this competition but highlighted the company’s advantage in terms of experience and knowledge. “I do think we are going to see more competition,” Haas said during a Goldman Sachs conference. However, she pointed out that most banks and other potential competitors lack the deep understanding of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency security that Coinbase has developed, positioning the firm as a potential partner for traditional institutions looking to enter the space. While the arrival of traditional financial institutions could increase competition, Smith does not see it as a threat to the crypto industry. Rather, she believes that the market will grow significantly as more players enter the space. “ I don’t think people in the industry are perceiving it as a threat because overall, the market will get much, much bigger ,” she added.

The rejection comes despite a strong push by MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor to convince shareholders. The National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR) submitted the proposal. Microsoft Rejects Bitcoin (BTC) The decision by Microsoft’s shareholders effectively ends any plans to integrate Bitcoin into the company’s treasury reserves. The proposal, submitted by the National Center for Public Policy Research, called for the company to evaluate the benefits of adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet, highlighting the asset’s ability to act as an excellent hedge against inflation. It also stated that Bitcoin had outperformed corporate bonds, and could help diversify the firm’s treasury. The proposal would not have resulted in an immediate investment into the asset but would have set the ball rolling for greater scrutiny of the idea. Michael Saylor, founder and CEO of MicroStrategy, also advocated for the benefits of such a move. “You can convert your cash flows and your dividends and your buybacks and your debt into Bitcoin. If you do that, you'll add hundreds of dollars to the stock price.” Saylor has advocated the idea of amassing Bitcoin to Microsoft previously. In a separate presentation to Microsoft’s leadership, Saylor argued that BTC’s valuation will jump from $2 trillion to $200 trillion in 21 years. He claimed that if Microsoft purchases BTC, it could potentially add $5 trillion in market value over the next decade. Saylor’s confidence comes from strict adherence to his thesis, which has paid off for MicroStrategy. MicroStrategy is known for its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy and has seen its stock surge nearly 2,500% since it began acquiring the asset. However, Microsoft shareholders rejected the idea and decided against following a similar path, calling the proposal unnecessary in a filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Volatility Worked Against Bitcoin (BTC) The Microsoft board highlighted BTC’s inherent volatility and reiterated the importance of maintaining stable and predictable investments to support the company and its operations. The board also stated the company had robust processes to manage its treasury and diversify existing assets for long-term shareholder benefit. When NCPPR highlighted similar strategies adopted by BlackRock and MicroStrategy as examples of successful BTC adoption by institutions, the board dismissed the comparisons, citing differences in corporate strategy. Meanwhile, some on X called Microsoft’s decision a historic mistake. “NEW: MICROSOFT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE NO ON #BITCOIN TREASURY THIS WILL GO DOWN AS A HISTORIC MISTAKE.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Solana price is being retraced to the $200 support level. Meanwhile, Intel Markets pilots its AI marketplace to provide safer and more profitable trading. Table of Contents Solana price struggle with bearish market pressure Intel Markets debut in AI marketplace Intel Markets’ features capture a beneficial position in presale Current price action and trading outlook Conclusion Solana (SOL), a dominant player in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, entered a correct phase last month after a bull run. On 3 December, Solana’s price surged to upper levels of $200 support amid the bearish market wave. While technical analysis indicates a consolidation will happen soon, Intel Markets is currently taking the spotlight with its AI-enabled marketplace debut. Solana price struggle with bearish market pressure The crypto space is facing an increase in volatility, with SOL facing pressure from current bearish market sentiments. After reaching a big high near $248 in the past, SOL has experienced a drop and has now resurfaced trading around the $220 market and testing the important $200 support. The difficulties faced by Solana indicate traders’ issues regarding macroeconomic challenges that influence digital assets. Nevertheless, Solana’s ecosystem remains robust. SOL is currently trading at $208. Solana price analysis shows uncertainty among traders in the rangebound market. SOL’s ongoing trading range of $200 to $248 can also indicate a big breakout or on the other hand, a big breakdown. If this support level is sustained, a faster rebound is expected for SOL, aiming to reach around $280. On the contrary, the failure to maintain the support level could also indicate a drop towards $180 for Solana price. Traders are suggested to monitor key resistance levels of Solana’s price. Intel Markets debut in AI marketplace While Solana’s price is dealing with a retracement to $200 support levels, Intel Markets has been gaining the spotlight and emerging as a promising altcoin of the future. INTL has recently turned to the seventh stage of presale with a token price of $0.064, garnering massive interest from investors. Intel Markets is all set to disrupt the trading space by debuting AI into the marketplace and building a more secure and efficient trading ecosystem. Intel Markets’ AI-enabled trading bots can assess huge quantities of data and can execute accurate and profitable trades. This lowers the risk and enhances the potential of earning big profits for INTL holders. Intel Markets provides a non-custodial wallet with automatic portfolio management. This assures high levels of asset security and smooth trading experience. With features like custom trading parameters and customized risk management, Intel Markets is the need of the hour, especially in the current unpredictable market space. You might also like: Dogecoin attracts investors as experts think Intel Markets could give 10x returns Intel Markets’ features capture a beneficial position in presale The platform’s reward structure is set to let user engagement get incentivized as investors can receive staking rewards, bonuses from registration, and even big discounts on trading fees. These benefits add to the lucrative positioning of this altcoin right from the current presale phase. INTL seems like an attractive destination for novice as well as seasoned traders. Current price action and trading outlook The ongoing presale momentum indicates that INTL will have massive appreciation once listed on major exchanges. As the INTL presale price and demand are increasing exponentially, early investors are going to have a golden opportunity to gain big levels of early-bird profits from the altcoin’s future growth. Solana price retracement showcases both risks and opportunities. Short-term traders have to be careful in the current volatile market conditions, and long-term investors can consider the current market scenario as a good opportunity to invest. Conclusion As SOL is showing a dicey future with the current Solana price retracement, Intel Markets is gathering all the eyes of investors with its AI marketplace. Traders and investors have a great opportunity to benefit from this hottest investment choice of this year. Features like advanced AI trading bots, and safe profile management make INTL a groundbreaking player in the upcoming future of cryptocurrency trading.

37507007,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/understanding-stock-pricing-from-ipos-to-real-time-market-dynamics,1733926497,Understanding Stock Pricing: From IPOs to Real-Time Market Dynamics,"The stock market's pricing mechanism forms the foundation of modern financial markets. Understanding price determination is essential for investors and traders alike. International Distribution Services PLC shares exemplify how market forces shape valuations, reflecting both short-term sentiment and long-term value. As Benjamin Graham famously observed, markets act as a voting machine in the short run but function as a weighing machine over time, measuring true business worth rather than momentary opinions. This fundamental concept captures the essence of stock pricing—prices reflect both immediate market sentiment and underlying business value. Today's stock markets operate through a complex interplay of factors, from fundamental analysis to technological innovations. Primary market pricing When a company first enters the public market through an Initial Public Offering (IPO) , investment banks play a crucial role in determining the initial stock price. This process, known as price discovery, involves careful analysis of several factors: Company's financial health and growth prospects Market conditions and investor sentiment Comparable company valuations Expected demand from institutional investors Investment banks, acting as underwriters, conduct a book-building process. They gather interest from potential investors at various price points to determine the optimal initial price. For instance, when Deliveroo launched its IPO in 2021, the initial price range was set at 390-460 pence per share, based on institutional investor feedback. Secondary market mechanics Basic principles Once shares begin trading on exchanges like the London Stock Exchange, price formation becomes dynamic. Supply and demand take centre stage, with thousands of market participants interacting through a sophisticated order-matching system. The exchange acts as a centralised marketplace where buyers and sellers meet. Each transaction occurs when a buyer's bid price matches a seller's ask price. This continuous process creates the familiar price movements we see during trading hours. Price formation factors Several key elements influence moment-to-moment price changes: The bid-ask spread represents the gap between the highest price buyers are willing to pay and the lowest price sellers will accept. Tighter spreads typically indicate higher liquidity. Market depth shows how many shares are available at different price levels. Greater depth usually means price movements are more stable. Trading volume provides insight into market interest and can indicate the strength of price movements. High volume often suggests stronger price trends. Fundamental valuation methods Company-based factors Long-term stock prices ultimately reflect a company's business performance. Key aspects include: Earnings growth and profitability trends Market position and competitive advantages Management effectiveness and strategy Industry conditions and growth potential Take Tesco plc as an example. Its stock price responds to factors like market share in the UK grocery sector, expansion plans, and operational efficiency improvements. Financial metrics Professional investors use various metrics to assess whether a stock's price is justified: The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio compares a company's share price to its earnings per share. For instance, if a stock trades at £100 and earns £5 per share, its P/E ratio is 20. Other important measures include: Price-to-book ratio: Compares market value to accounting value Dividend yield: Annual dividend payments relative to share price Cash flow analysis: Evaluates the company's ability to generate cash Each metric provides different insights into whether a stock might be overvalued or undervalued, though no single measure tells the complete story. External price drivers Market factors The broader market environment significantly influences individual stock prices. Think of sector trends as powerful currents that can lift or sink all boats. For instance, British energy stocks surged collectively when oil prices spiked in early 2022, regardless of individual company performance. Competition within industries shapes pricing dynamics too. When Marks & Spencer announced strong digital sales growth, it affected not just its own share price but also those of competitors like Next and ASOS, as investors reassessed the entire retail sector's online potential. Macro influences Global economic conditions cast long shadows over stock prices. Interest rates, set by the Bank of England, particularly impact stock valuations. When rates rise, as seen in recent rate hike cycles, stocks often face downward pressure as bonds become more attractive investments. Currency fluctuations add another layer of complexity. For FTSE 100 companies earning significant revenues abroad, a weaker pound typically boosts their stock prices, as overseas earnings translate into more pounds. Modern market dynamics Technology impact Today's stock prices move at lightning speed, driven by sophisticated technology. High-frequency trading systems, operating in microseconds, now account for over 50% of UK stock market volume. These algorithms scan news feeds, analyse trading patterns, and execute trades faster than any human could blink. Dark pools and electronic communication networks have created new venues for price discovery. These alternative trading systems match large institutional orders away from traditional exchanges, though their prices eventually feed back into the main market. Information flow The democratisation of financial information has transformed price formation. Social media platforms can now move markets as quickly as traditional news sources. When Elon Musk tweets about a company, its stock price often reacts within seconds. Professional analysts still play a crucial role: Publishing detailed research reports Providing earnings estimates Offering buy/sell recommendations Conducting management interviews Their insights help investors contextualise raw information and form more nuanced views on appropriate stock prices. Price manipulation and regulation Market integrity remains crucial for fair price formation. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) actively monitors for suspicious trading patterns that might indicate manipulation. Common red flags include: Unusual trading volumes Coordinated trading activity Misleading market announcements Artificial price movements Recent technology improvements have enhanced surveillance capabilities, making it harder to manipulate prices without detection. The FCA's enforcement actions serve as a deterrent, helping maintain market confidence. Conclusion Understanding stock price formation requires appreciating its multifaceted nature. While short-term prices might reflect immediate market sentiment, long-term valuations ultimately align with fundamental business performance. For market participants, this suggests focusing on: Company fundamentals rather than market noise Long-term trends over daily fluctuations Multiple information sources for better context Risk management through proper research Stock prices represent the market's best estimate of value at any moment, based on all available information. This dynamic process never stops evolving, making continuous learning essential for anyone involved in the markets. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

37507757,https://blockworks.co/news/ripple-thriving-blockchain-ecosystem,1733926365,Ripple could still nail this magic blockchain recipe,"This is a segment from the Empire newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . If a thriving blockchain ecosystem were a recipe, the ingredients would go something like this: One consensus mechanism Four DeFi apps* A driven founder/figurehead One native stablecoin (at least) Two legal entities (dev studio and foundation) One token bridge (minimum) Three terminally online reply guys The secret ingredient would be one or more of the following: funding rounds, mid-cap memecoins, NFT collections, active VC funds and third-party validator clients. *Minimum required DeFi apps: DEX w/ token launchpads, lending/collateralized debt, liquid staking, oracle So, while there are now hundreds of smart contract platforms with halfway decent market capitalizations, not all are buzzing to quite the same degree as the majors — Ethereum, Solana and BNB. Case in point: XRPL, which has all but $63 million TVL in its onchain apps. Ripple Labs is right now working hard on finishing its own recipe, more than 12 years after its launch. Starting easy, XRPL does have the consensus mechanism, albeit without the usual staking or mining, instead relying on trusted validators. And it already has a few token bridges. There are also two legal entities: the San Francisco-headquartered Ripple Labs and the Estonian non-profit XRP Ledger Foundation, which was recently rebranded to the Inclusive Financial Technology Foundation. Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse obviously ticks the box for driven founder-slash-figurehead. As for the reply guys, David Schwartz, Ripple Labs’ long-serving CTO, has built a following on solid reply guy energy (check). Every major blockchain could do with a David Schwartz And anyone who has ever tweeted anything remotely critique-adjacent has likely been visited by the XRP Army — which together truly harnesses the power of much more than just two reply guys (check check). That leaves the four DeFi apps and a native stablecoin. XRPL currently has four DeFi apps with 100 unique active wallets interacting with them daily right now — but three of them are DEXs and one is an NFT marketplace. As of last month, it does have a native oracle, which should help to attract builders. And conveniently, XRPL is the exception to the rule (with no direct staking XRP as part of consensus), so it can do without the liquid staking app in any case. The only ingredients then left are a bustling lending protocol and a native stablecoin. Luckily, a stablecoin is very much on the way: Ripple USD (RLUSD), which the New York State Department of Financial Services just approved for offering. It’ll be structured similarly to Circle’s USDT and Tether’s USDT, backed by cash and equivalents (mostly short-dated US Treasurys). With XRPL so close to acquiring all the necessary ingredients to really pop, it’s no surprise then that DeFi veteran Robert Leshner is now open to backing projects building out the Ripple ecosystem via his fund (VC bonus point get!). The pièce de résistance for XRPL would then be a roster of its own mid-cap memecoins, as is traditional fare. Like it or not, those are cooking too, although the biggest of which is an XRP Army-themed coin with a $45 million market cap (still too small). The bright side: Only $15 million in tokens were traded on XRPL in the past day. Should RLUSD find decent traction, watch that number only go up from here to fully round out the recipe. Bellisimo!

37506939,https://crypto.news/?p=14318423,1733926330,3 reasons why Solana price may jump to $500 soon,"Solana price staged a strong recovery after dropping to a low of $204 on Dec. 11, with signs pointing to a more sustained rebound. Solana ( SOL ) rose to $227, bringing its market cap to over $107 billion. This recovery mirrored that of other cryptocurrencies, including Ripple ( XRP ) and Avalanche ( AVAX ). Here are the three reasons why the SOL price may soon jump to over $500. Data shows that Solana is becoming increasingly scarce as the number of tokens on exchanges continues to decline. Nansen data indicates that the amount of SOL tokens on exchanges fell by 13% in the last seven days to 282.24 million. Solana tokens on exchanges | Source: Nansen This decline is likely driven by two factors. First, many investors are moving their coins to self-custody wallets. Second, a significant number of investors are staking their SOL tokens. According to StakingRewards , Solana’s staking ratio stands at 65%, higher than that of most coins like Ethereum ( ETH ), Polkadot ( DOT ), and Cosmos ( ATOM ). You might also like: Popcat price slips as smart money sells, exchange balances rise Second, Solana may continue rising because of its role in the crypto industry. Data shows that protocols on the Solana network handled $32.46 billion in trading volume over the past seven days, surpassing Ethereum’s $25 billion. In addition to its DEX dominance, Solana is gaining traction in other areas of the crypto industry, including gaming and decentralized public infrastructure. This growth is translating into financial gains, with the network collecting over $672 million in fees this year. Solana price technicals suggest more gains are possible Solana price chart | source: crypto.news Third, technicals suggest that Solana price has more gains to go. On the daily chart, the coin has formed a bullish flag pattern, which happens when an asset forms a long vertical line and a flag-like pattern. It is one of the most bullish patterns in the market. Solana has also formed a break-and-retest pattern by falling to $210 on Tuesday. This was an important level since it was the highest swing in March this year. It is common for an asset to retest a key resistance or support level and then continue the uptrend. On the weekly chart, SOL has also formed a cup-and-handle pattern with a depth of approximately 97%. By projecting 97% from the upper side of the cup at $260, the price could potentially rise to $511 in the long term.

Pepe MAGA (PEPEMAGA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe MAGA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe MAGA by entering its contract address – C3zan7DDUAxZDSLnSxpptmyARsvGAbah4KWQB5QokoFM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEMAGA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/pepe-maga-pepemaga-solana-memecoin-will-rally-18000-ahead-of-first-exchange-listing-while-shib-wif-and-bonk-underperform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

The Proof of Stake mechanism of Cardano ADA has helped it host a lot of dApps and add a rigorous academic approach to its path. The real-world use cases of Cardano ADA have also helped expand its reach in the market. But in the last week, Cardano ADA has performed opposite to the climb other altcoins like Bitgert ’s $BRISE coin have taken. While Bitgert’s $BRISE coin was up by nearly 18%, Cardano ADA showed a depreciation of 20% in just a week. People are now choosing Bitgert’s $BRISE coin over Cardano ADA; let’s find out why. The Foundation of Cardano ADA Launched in 2017 by Charles Hoskinson, Cardano ADA quickly formed an image as a sustainable and innovative blockchain in the world. The hosting of dApps and the adoption of smart contracts made Cardano ADA a neck-to-neck competitor to Ethereum. The Alonzo hard fork and Shelley upgrade also helped in carving the success of Cardano ADA in the market. However, the current approach of Cardano ADA has not been as innovation-hungry and rapid as it was earlier. Cardano ADA struggles with transaction speed issues, while Bitgert’s BRISE chain seems to have solved them. Let’s see how Bitgert has overtaken Cardano ADA in its own game. Bitgert’s Rise and Forming a Strong Community While Cardano ADA has been struggling in the market, Bitgert’s $BRISE coin has dropped a zero in its pricing in just a few days. Bitgert’s growing popularity is fueled by its community and strong ecosystem. Bitgert ’s BRISE chain offers transactions at a near-zero fee and a 100k TPS speed. Also, in-house projects like PayBrise, Web3 Real Estate Marketplace, P2P marketplace, BrisePump, AI Audit Platform, etc., add more users and audiences to the network. Bitgert handles over 2.5k transactions daily, with more than 189k holders of Bitgert’s $BRISE coin. The numbers for Bitgert’s $BRISE coin are rising in every sense, with a hike of about 43% in pricing. Bitgert also takes care of its community by answering their queries on their handles and organizing innovative competitions for user engagement. Conclusion Bitgert’s $BRISE coin is performing stupendously as opposed to the current performance of Cardano ADA. According to the current analytics, Bitgert’s $BRISE coin may even give 100x gains to investors, as it did for early-stage investors. Bitgert’s $BRISE coin is getting strong support from the market, which its RSI index, MACD level, and the moving average suggest. So, if you are wondering which token to invest in at the current stage, then going with Bitgert’s $BRISE coin over Cardano ADA will be a profitable choice.

But indicators suggest a rebound may be on the horizon. The Relative Strength Index is below 30, pointing to an oversold condition that often precedes a price surge. If the coin breaks through the resistance around $4.65, it could aim for the next level near $5.75. This move would represent a significant gain from current prices. Over the past month, Dogwifhat has climbed almost 15%, showing strong momentum. With the anticipated altcoin season and a global crypto bull run, Dogwifhat might be set for substantial growth in the near future. Popcat (POPCAT) Ready to Bounce Back After Recent Decline Popcat (POPCAT) is trading between $1.20 and $1.71. Though it has dropped in the past week and month, it’s up over 270% in the last six months. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is around 30, indicating it may be oversold and could rebound soon. If Popcat moves past the nearby resistance at $1.90, it might reach the next level at $2.41, which is a significant increase from the current price. The simple moving averages suggest an upward trend could be on the horizon. With these signals, Popcat might be gearing up for a strong comeback. Bonk Gathers Momentum: Is a Bull Run on the Horizon? Bonk’s price is showing promising signs. After a 15% dip this week, it’s still up 61% for the month. The current price is near the top of its recent range. Both the RSI and Stochastic are around 30, hinting the coin is oversold and may bounce back. If Bonk breaks past the nearest resistance level, it could climb to the next target, gaining substantial percentages. The 10-day and 100-day moving averages are aligning, which might signal upward momentum. With altcoin season approaching, Bonk could be set to join the global crypto bull run. MEW Poised for Breakout as Altcoin Season Approaches Cat in a Dogs World (MEW) is trading near its support level after recent drops of nearly 20% over the past week and month. The RSI is low, indicating that it’s oversold and may be due for a rebound. The current price is below both the 10-day and 100-day moving averages, suggesting potential upward movement. With altcoin season approaching, MEW could rise to its resistance levels at $0.0114 and $0.0133, signaling strong growth from current prices. Over the past six months, MEW has already climbed over 70%, and further increases could be ahead as the market turns bullish. Conclusion While WIF, POPCAT, BONK, and MEW have less short-term potential, DOGEN stands out as the meme token for alpha males, embodying luxury and success. Expected 700% growth by presale’s end and potential thousand-fold returns this altcoin season, DOGEN follows successful tokens’ path, building a community of leaders with real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters.

The meme coin is among the top-performing crypto coins currently, gaining prominence day by day. Pepe has now surpassed Uniswap’s market cap, an indication of its incredible performance throughout the year. 1Fuel is another token likely to replicate and eventually surpass Pepe’s success. Unlike Pepe , the 1Fuel token has real-life use cases and could become full-blown soon. The new token is presently on presale, and investors could get up to 200x from joining the presale early. 1Fuel holds a lot of promises, and we look into them below. 1Fuel to dominate the crypto space after public launch According to analysts, post-launch 1Fuel could be a contender for the best crypto buy 2025. The new token is expected to rally impressively after its public launch and could give many investors a major financial breakthrough. 1Fuel is currently valued at $0.01 on presale, but experts are not putting a 100x pump past the token. The general belief is that 1Fuel will pump hard in 2025, and early investors are likely to gain the most. The optimism surrounding 1Fuel is creating a FOMO, with the token’s presale now gaining more traction than before. 1Fuel is on the verge of selling out its stage on allocation, and the next stage could sell out even faster. Market observers say investors’ potential profit reduces at every stage of 1Fuel’s presale, making now the best time to act. Smart investors have already secured stakes in the presale, and there’s room for more. The 1Fuel project developers have stated that 1Fuel is a project for all. The crypto solution’s major objective is to solve prevalent issues in the DeFi space, which include transaction complexity, privacy issues, security vulnerabilities, and high fees. 1Fuel is built to address these concerns using the necessary technologies and approaches. The innovative solution will contribute to the increasing adoption of the DeFi space by allowing easy accessibility and a better experience. With the 1Fuel token, users will be able to utilize and earn from the 1Fuel platform. The token’s utilities will contribute to its value increase, making it a potential best crypto buy in 2025. Pepe soars above $11 billion market cap as prominence increases Pepe has continued to impress in the crypto space this year. The meme coin is one of the top-performing crypto coins currently and could keep that up in 2025. Pepe set another all-time high a few days ago, rallying to $0.00002825. Pepe is expected to exceed Shiba Inu’s valuation drastically soon, and it may beat the dog-themed token to $0.000050. Pepe’s surge saw its market cap move up to 19th on the log, leapfrogging Uniswap and Bitcoin Cash. The market cap soared to $11 billion briefly, but the current market condition has seen it dump back to $10.6 billion. Pepe itself has dipped by 11% since setting the new all-time high, but while other altcoins are having a negative seven-day run, Pepe remains in the green zone. Pepe has yielded high returns for investors in the past week, and it is expected to be one of the first to beat current bear pressure. The meme coin looks keen to end the year stronger and end up around $0.000035 heading into the new year. Analysts say that, at the current rate, Pepe could break into the top 10 market rankings before the end of 2025. It is high on investors’ list of best crypto buys in 2025. Conclusion Crypto investors could improve their portfolios with Pepe and 1Fuel . While Pepe has proven itself over time, 1Fuel is showing good prospects. The new token is tipped to return high profits, making it a good investment. Get in on the 1Fuel presale now to enjoy a possible high yield.

37506572,https://crypto.news/?p=14318399,1733925600,ETH price rises amid growing adoption of Layer-2 solutions,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Ethereum’s rise continues to dominate headlines, but the spotlight is also shifting to 1Fuel, a crypto wallet redefining digital asset trading with its smart features and presale success. Table of Contents 1Fuel might just be the crypto trading platform of the future High market activity, increased network adoption boost ETH Conclusion As Ethereum continues its impressive surge, fueled by increased adoption of Layer-2 solutions, the crypto landscape is witnessing exciting new developments. Amid this backdrop, investors are buzzing about the emergence of a new crypto wallet called 1Fuel, which is redefining how digital assets are traded. With 1Fuel already capturing the attention of the majority of the DeFi market’s users with its features and fast-growing crypto presale, let’s explore why users should capitalize on this investment opportunity. 1Fuel might just be the crypto trading platform of the future Most crypto users dream of a world where trading cryptocurrency is as simple as a single click, no wallets to juggle, no hidden fees. That’s the future 1Fuel is creating. Designed for seamless and cross-chain transactions, 1Fuel takes the hassle out of trading by handling swaps in the background thereby allowing users to focus entirely on their earning goals. The platform also features a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange, allowing direct user trades without traditional fees and providing access to diverse assets. For spending, 1Fuel offers secure crypto debit cards, enabling instant crypto-to-fiat conversions and simplifying everyday purchases. Moreover, 1Fuel includes advanced privacy features such as disposable wallets and an integrated mixer for safe crypto transactions. Cold storage solutions safeguard substantial assets with secure element chips and multi-signature protocols, reducing financial risk. To power its ecosystem, 1Fuel utilizes its unique utility token, OFT, which incentivizes users. Four percent of the total supply of OFT tokens is reserved for staking rewards, allowing 1Fuel to offer up to 30% APR to enhance network security and reward long-term holders. Liquidity providers and active traders will also benefit from dedicated token allocations. High market activity, increased network adoption boost ETH Since President-elect Donald Trump’s win was announced in November 2024, Ethereum, like most other cryptos, has been witnessing green charts and high market activity. The recent spike in activity on Ethereum is a result of both technical and situational factors. On the technical side, CryptoQuant expert Burak Kesmeci reports that active addresses on the Ethereum network rose by 36% from 306,000 to 417,000 in just one month. As a result, within that month, Ethereum’s price went from $3,193 to its current value of about $3,638 (at time of writing). But the rise in active addresses is just one indicator contributing to the growing optimism surrounding Ethereum. Situational factors also play a role, particularly the increased adoption of Layer-2 networks in the crypto space. As Ethereum is a major player in this sector, the growing interest from investors in adding it to their crypto wallets and portfolios is likely driving its value upward. Conclusion While Ethereum is witnessing a good run in today’s market, many investors are already taking advantage of 1Fuel’s crypto presale and grabbing OFT tokens at just $0.01 each. Join the presale now and become part of the next generation of secure and cross-chain crypto transactions. To learn more about 1Fuel, visit the presale website, Telegram , and Twitter .

37506365,https://crypto.news/?p=14318394,1733925207,"Popcat price slips as smart money sells, exchange balances rise","Popcat price has declined by over 40% from its highest level this year as signs of increased selling pressure emerge. Popcat ( POPCAT ), the third-largest meme coin on the Solana ( SOL ) network, retreated to $1.0342, its lowest level since Oct. 24. Data from Nansen shows that the volume of Popcat coins on exchanges has increased by 7.7% over the last seven days, rising to over 223.94 million. This increase brings the total supply on exchanges to about 22.8%. Most of these coins are held on exchanges like Bybit, Kraken, Gate, and Raydium. An increase in the number of coins on exchanges is often considered a bearish signal for a cryptocurrency, as it suggests that holders may be preparing to sell. Further Nansen data reveals that the number of smart money investors holding Popcat has dropped significantly, from 85 a few months ago to 40 today.

Additional data shows that the number of Popcat holders is not growing. According to CoinCarp , it had 116,400 holders on Dec. 11, a small increase from a day earlier.

The MACD and the Relative Strength Index have tilted downwards and moved below their neutral levels. As a result, the token may continue to decline, with sellers potentially targeting the psychological level of $0.50—a drop of approximately 58% from the current price.

That's the message from the price chart and options market.  The payments-focused cryptocurrency is down 10% this week. The pullback, however, has taken the shape of a bull flag. This technical analysis pattern usually slopes in the opposite direction of the preceding sharp uptrend and, more often than not, recharges bulls' engines for further gains.  ""The breakout should be expected in the direction of the preceding trend, provided it is steep and sharp,"" Charles Kirkpatrick, a chartered market technician and the president of Kirkpatrick & Company, Inc, said in the book ""Technical Analysis, the Complete Resource For Finance Market Technicians.""  ""Flags preceded by a rise of 90% or more have almost zero failure rate and an average return of 69%,"" Kirkpatrick added.  XRP is forming a bull flag after a rally of nearly 500% to $2.9 in the four weeks to Dec. 3. An eventual breakout would mean scope for a rally to $5. The potential level is identified by adding the magnitude of the preceding uptrend to the breakout point, currently at around $2.5 in what is known as a measured height method in technical analysis terminology.  Interestingly, activity is heating up in the $5 strike call options on Deribit, offering an asymmetric upside to buyers on a potential move above that level.  The $5 call is the second-most traded XRP option of the past 24 hours, with a volume of 1.7 million contracts, according to data source Amberdata. (One contract represents 1 XRP).  Besides, Deribit data shows the $5 call is the most popular out-of-the-money or higher strike call option with a notional open interest of $1.25 million. The increased activity indicates a bullish positioning, assuming the buyers are traders, not market makers.  Still, readers might want to note that technical analysis patterns do not always work as intended, and options market positioning can flip quickly per evolving price trends. As such, tracking the broader market sentiment is pivotal.",POSITIVE,XRP,MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/11/a-bullish-xrp-flag-emerges-as-5-call-options-heat-up-godbole,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/234346f55259dfcdcc860efbe4d7391977894845-1280x853.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, even more interestingly, once the bull run kicked off in November, the digital asset experienced a huge move to the upside, with prices moving from roughly $0.5 to a high of $2.71 At press time, XRP was trading at $2.38 — marking a 305.84% gain on the monthly chart that has brought year-to-date (YTD) returns up to 287.19%. With this latest move, XRP has become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency in the world by market capitalization — ahead of Solana ( SOL ). XRP price monthly and YTD charts. Source: Finbold Although the upswing has seen a small correction, numerous analysts are quite bullish on the digital asset, with some predicting that it could even reach prices as high as $48 for a 1,888% rally . XRP is one of the cryptocurrencies with the best returns in 2024, barring meme coins — and although it occasionally sees sharp corrections, like when Ripple Labs clarified that, rumors aside, it would not be launching its long-awaited stablecoin on December 4, it remains an attractive investment. In order to get a more holistic sense of where XRP price could be headed as we reach the end of 2024, Finbold consulted one of the most powerful publicly available large language models — OpenAI’ s ChatGPT-4o for additional clarity. ChatGPT outlined the bullish and bearish factors affecting XRP When queried, the artificial intelligence tool noted four bullish factors and just as many bearish ones. In terms of potential catalysts for further growth, ChatGPT highlighted the recent approval of Ripple Labs’ stablecoin, RLUSD , which is to be pegged to the U.S. dollar as a development that could enhance utility and broaden the wider ecosystem’s appeal. The large language model also reflected on President-elect Donald Trump’s nomination of Paul Atkins, widely seen as a pro-crypto choice, for chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as an event that could lead to the dismissal of the regulatory body’s ongoing lawsuit against Ripple Labs. Finally, ChatGPT indicated that increased institutional adoption and the post-election rally were likewise bullish factors. Bullish factors affecting XRP. Source: OpenAI In contrast, on the bearish side of the aisle, OpenAI’s model observed that recent developments in the SEC case were not to Ripple’s advantage and that this fact could negatively impact XRP’s price stability. To boot, it pointed out increased volatility and short-term price declines on account of profit-taking, as well as indicators of market saturation as factors that could stymie further growth or even cause XRP prices to decrease. Bearish factors affecting XRP. Source: OpenAI Once everything was said and done, ChatGPT laid out two price targets. According to the AI model, if the bullish factors prove dominant, by the end of the year, XRP prices could reach levels as high as $3.84, which would represent a 61% upside. Conversely, in case the bearish factors prove to be stronger, ChatGPT set a price at the $2 support level, which would equate to a 16% drop from the current price of XRP.

Source: OpenAI Analysts point to promising technical analysis signals that herald more gains for XRP While interesting, it should be noted that the output of large language models — even ones as advanced as ChatGPT-4o, should not be given the same level of credence that expert analysis and personal due diligence warrant. With that in mind, cryptocurrency analysts seem to broadly agree with the AI model’s bullish assessment. On December 11, expert technical analyst Crypto Lalit pointed out the formation of a bullish flag pattern on XRP’s daily chart in an X post , which suggests that renowned bullish momentum is coming.

37506418,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=625919,1733924945,President Trump vows to keep a close eye on Bitcoin’s price while in the Oval,"President Trump is making Bitcoin a key priority in his second term, vowing to keep a sharp focus on its price while steering his administration into a crypto-friendly era. The incoming administration has drawn up plans to integrate cryptocurrency, artificial intelligence, and Silicon Valley’s fast-paced ethos into the very core of Washington. Trump’s approach to Bitcoin is as direct as ever: no overregulation, no stifling, and a strong push for America to dominate. Eric Trump, speaking at the Bitcoin MENA 2024 conference in the United Arab Emirates, set the tone by declaring that his father’s administration would be “the most pro-crypto presidency in history.” He celebrated Bitcoin’s milestone of hitting $100,000, also crediting his father’s decision to appoint a crypto-friendly SEC chair. Silicon Valley lands in Washington It’s pretty clear that Trump’s second term will be about reshaping the U.S. government with Silicon Valley’s biggest disruptors. David Sacks, a veteran of the “PayPal Mafia,” has been tapped as the new White House AI and crypto czar. “We want to make America the clear global leader in both areas,” he has said, outlining plans to overhaul federal crypto policies. Elon Musk, Trump’s biggest donor this election cycle and his partner in overhauling government priorities, will wield unprecedented influence. From living at Mar-a-Lago to accompanying Trump on global visits, Elon is now co-architect of the new administration, pushing for radical changes in spending and personnel. Under Trump, Elon-backed projects are set to receive a significant boost, including a reshaped NASA led by tech billionaire Jared Isaacman, who famously partnered with SpaceX for a private spacewalk. And then there’s the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE—yes, named after Dogecoin. Co-founded by biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon, DOGE’s goal is to streamline government processes, eliminating what Musk calls “old-school inefficiency.” Crypto ties trigger ethical questions Eric’s was a business move. The Trump family’s new cryptocurrency platform, World Liberty Financial, was heavily promoted during the event. “The system turned on us, and crypto turned us back on,” he said, pointing directly at JPMorgan Chase and other banks that distanced themselves from the Trump Organization. During the conference, Eric and Steve Witkoff, Trump’s new Middle East envoy and a longtime real estate associate, met with Justin Sun, a crypto executive facing fraud charges from the SEC right now. But the ethical questions don’t end there. Witkoff, while working on a Middle East peace deal, also promoted World Liberty Financial at the event. His dual role as a government official and business promoter is fueling concerns over blurred lines between public service and private profit. The rise of Trump’s tech dynasty Beyond crypto, Trump’s administration is poised to be a tech-driven machine. Peter Thiel, another “PayPal Mafia” alum and longtime Trump ally, has secured key positions for his network. Jim O’Neill, former CEO of the Thiel Foundation, is stepping in as deputy secretary of Health and Human Services. Vice President-elect JD Vance, a former venture capitalist mentored by Thiel, is expected to champion tech-friendly policies. Marc Andreessen, an internet pioneer and crypto elite, has also joined the fray, interviewing candidates for top government positions alongside Elon. Even Jeff Bezos, Elon’s famously top rival, appears aligned with Trump’s vision. At the same time, Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chairman and a convicted felon pardoned during Trump’s first term, is back in the mix. Speaking at Bitcoin MENA, Manafort celebrated Bitcoin’s rise and hinted at even higher prices under Trump’s leadership. “This is just the beginning,” he told the crowd.

Dogecoin ( DOGE ), the largest meme coin in the crypto industry, rebounded to $0.40 after falling to $0.36 a day earlier. This recovery occurred as Bitcoin ( BTC ) and most altcoins attempted to regain ground. Bitcoin rose to $98,500 after bottoming at $94,200 earlier in the week. Similarly, altcoins such as Ethereum and Solana also posted slight recoveries. Cryptocurrency analysts remain optimistic about Dogecoin, noting that it is still in a strong bull run. In an X post, Scofield, a popular crypto analyst with over 80,000 followers, noted that it was the last opportunity to buy the coin before a significant rally. He pointed to the fact that it was sitting at a key support level on the four-hour chart Meanwhile, Ali Martinez, another prominent analyst, predicted that Dogecoin’s price could eventually rise to $3 during this bullish cycle. If market conditions turn highly favorable, he forecasted a potential surge to $18, representing a 4,400% move higher.

The target remains $3, and if things go wild, $18! pic.twitter.com/jdPODkxgHe — Ali (@ali_charts) December 9, 2024 A key catalyst for Dogecoin’s price could be Bitcoin’s rebound and a move above its all-time high. If Bitcoin achieves this, it is likely to trigger a strong bullish breakout for DOGE. Another potential driver is the incoming Donald Trump administration, which is anticipated to adopt a crypto-friendly stance. In the long term, the approval of a spot DOGE ETF could also lead to increased demand for the token. Dogecoin price needs to flip $0.4843 DOGE price chart | source: crypto.news The weekly chart shows that DOGE has been in a strong uptrend for the past several weeks, rising for eight consecutive weeks. This explains its temporary breather this week, as assets often pull back after extended gains. Dogecoin price remains above the 50-week and 200-week moving averages and the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level. It has also moved to the ultimate resistance of the Murrey Math Lines. Therefore, for DOGE to rise and hit $1, bulls will need to push it above the key resistance point at $0.4843, the year-to-date high. If this happens, the next vital price to watch in its path to $1 will be $0.7500, its all-time high.

This marks the second consecutive monthly rise, following increases from 2.4% in September to 2.6% in October.

Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon has said that the investment banking major would evaluate trading cryptocurrencies should US regulations permit the bank to do so. “At the moment, as a regulated banking institution, we’re not allowed to own a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin as a principal,” he said at a Reuters Next conference , held on Tuesday, 10 December. “We give our clients advice around a variety of these technologies and these issues, and will continue to do that. But for the moment our ability to act in these markets is extremely limited from a regulatory perspective.” Interestingly, Goldman Sachs disclosed in its recent US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 13F filing that the company holds more than $700M in eight Bitcoin ETFs, as of September 20, 2024. So, it would appear that at long last, corporate attitudes to crypto are finally changing. Even US President-elect Donald Trump has positioned himself as a champion of cryptocurrency. The launch of a strategic national crypto stockpile was among the promises made by Trump in the run-up to the 2024 election. Removing Gary Gensler – the nemesis of crypto companies due to his aggressive approach to crypto regulation – from his position as SEC Chairman was another. A Green Light for Ripple’s Stablecoin Means Meme Coins Pump The big news for the cryptocurrency economy keeps on rolling, as Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently announced that its $RLUSD stablecoin has been approved by the New York Department of Financial Services to go live. Pegged to the US dollar at a 1:1 ratio, $RLUSD will be supported by a combination of US dollar reserves, short-term US Treasury securities, and other liquid assets, mirroring Tether’s approach to backing. $RLUSD is set to be launched on the XRP ledger in Ethereum. In all, the latest developments are great news for the economy, cryptocurrency holders, and the likes of Best Wallet. Powered by Best Wallet’s $BEST token – currently in presale with an impressive $3.34M already raised – Best Wallet plans to capture 40% of the crypto wallet market share by end-2026. Best Wallet is mobile-first, fully non-custodial app supports thousands of cryptocurrencies, including the best meme coins , across 50 major blockchains. But it’s that non-custodial aspect that sets Best Wallet apart. Most crypto wallets are controlled by centralized companies or exchanges, whereas Best Wallet gives users full control over their wallet. And that’s in addition to reduced transaction fees, early access to presales, and airdrops. It’s also the first crypto wallet to use Fireblocks’ MPC-CMP wallet technology, which adds high security, zero counterparty risk, and multi-blockchain support. All things considered, we believe $BEST is worthwhile looking into. Investors have just under two days to secure $BEST at its current price of $0.23075 before the next price increase.

According to local media outlet On CC , Hong Kong Councilor Johnny Ng suggested that the government should consider adding cryptocurrencies into its fiscal reserves. Ng said that the government could use the Hong Kong Exchange Fund to hold and buy crypto assets . Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Joseph Chan responded to Ng’s request with a written letter, explaining that crypto assets are not the “target asset” for Hong Kong Exchange Fund investments. However, Chan does confirm at the Legislative Council meeting that the Hong Kong Exchange Fund does hold a small amount of crypto assets through external investment managers. Though, he said the proportion is “very small.” You might also like: Hong Kong looks to speed up crypto regulation amid rising sector demands The Hong Kong Monetary Authority external investment managers often diversify the fund’s asset classes and markets with assets and stocks from around the world, depending on the asset performance evaluated by external investment managers at different times. Chan pointed out that authorities issued the “Policy Declaration on the Development of Virtual Assets in Hong Kong” in October 2022, indicating that the government and regulatory agencies adhere to the same principle of “same business, same risks, same rules” when it comes to virtual assets. In addition, authorities have introduced a licensing system for virtual asset service providers through amendments to the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance Bill to ensure that crypto trading platforms comply with international standards. As previously reported by crypto.news , the Hong Kong government is looking for ways to speed up the making of crypto regulations in order to keep up with the rapidly evolving global crypto industry. Chan did not elaborate on how the Hong Kong government plans to fast-track its crypto regulations.

Scams using social engineering and malicious bots are evolving to compromise crypto wallets and sensitive data through platforms like Telegram and fake meeting apps. Meanwhile, the sentencing of former Celsius executive Roni Cohen-Pavon has been postponed to 2025 to potentially help in the prosecution of ex-CEO Alex Mashinsky. Pastor Faces CFTC Lawsuit Over Crypto Fraud The United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed a lawsuit against Francier Obando Pinillo, a pastor that is accused of orchestrating a $6 million cryptocurrency Ponzi scheme targeting more than 1,500 people. Some of his victims include members of his congregation in Washington state. The CFTC announced the legal action on Dec. 10, and the regulator alleges that Pinillo engaged in fraud and misappropriation through a multilevel marketing scheme under the guise of cryptocurrency trading and staking services. According to the complaint that was filed in a Spokane federal court, Pinillo presented himself as the CEO of Solanofi, Solano Partners Ltd., and Solano Capital Investments. He claimed that he developed a ”Solano ecosystem” that utilized advanced crypto trading platforms. Between November of 2021 and December of 2023, Pinillo allegedly convinced customers that his operations traded popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT), Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE). He also promised monthly profits of up to 34.9% through a proprietary trading bot and software. The workings of a Ponzi scheme (Source: Dimond Kaplan & Rothstein ) The scheme also included a staking service branded as Solanofi 2.0, which guaranteed profits. To encourage participation even more, users were provided with an online dashboard showing fabricated account statements and were offered a 15% referral fee for recruiting others. The CFTC's investigation revealed that these claims were entirely fraudulent. There was no automated trading program, no actual customer accounts, and no trading activities or profits. Instead, Pinillo misappropriated all of the funds that were transferred by customers. The CFTC revealed that Pinillo targeted unsophisticated people with very minimal knowledge of crypto transactions. He also took advantage of his position as a pastor and communicated predominantly in Spanish to gain their trust. The regulator is seeking restitution for the affected victims, the forfeiture of the funds that were generated through the scheme, a permanent trading ban, and an injunction to prevent any future violations. Another New Scam Targets Crypto Wallets Unfortunately, the latest crypto scam stories do not stop with Ponzi schemes. Scammers are also increasingly using a combination of social engineering and fake Telegram verification bots to deploy crypto-stealing malware, according to blockchain security firm Scam Sniffer . In a recent post on X, Scam Sniffer shared some details about a new scam tactic involving fake X accounts impersonating popular crypto influencers . These accounts lure victims into Telegram groups with promises of exclusive investment insights. Once users join these groups, they are asked to verify themselves through a fraudulent bot called “OfficiaISafeguardBot.” This bot uses urgency tactics, like short verification windows, to pressure users into compliance. During the verification process, the bot injects malicious PowerShell code that downloads and executes malware that is designed to compromise computer systems and crypto wallets. According to Scam Sniffer, this malware has been responsible for large amounts of private key thefts that allowed scammers to raid wallets. The firm acknowledged that while malware targeting crypto users has been around for years now, the sophistication of these scams advanced rapidly. Successful heists encouraged the evolution of scams into a “scam-as-a-service” model, where tools like wallet-draining software are rented out to phishing operators. This particular combination of fake X accounts, Telegram channels, and malicious bots, however, is a newer development. The firm also reported a rise in impersonation scams on X. Its monitoring systems identified an average of 300 fake accounts daily in December, compared to 160 in November. At least two victims reportedly lost more than $3 million after interacting with malicious links and signing transactions prompted by these fake accounts. The threat extends beyond just Telegram and X. Scammers Target Web3 Workers Web3 workers are also facing targeted attacks from scammers using fake meeting apps to inject malware and steal sensitive information, according to a report by Cado Security Labs. The campaign involves scammers posing as legitimate companies by creating realistic websites and social media accounts by using artificial intelligence. They contact potential victims, often through platforms like Telegram, and prompt them to download a meeting app named ”Meeten,” which frequently changes its name to evade detection. Some of its previous aliases include ”Meetio,” ”Clusee.com,” ”Cuesee,” ”Meeten.gg,” ”Meeten.us,” and ”Meetone.gg.” The app contains the Realst info stealer that is designed to extract critical data like Telegram logins, banking card details, and crypto wallet information. After this information is gathered, it is sent back to the attackers. It can also harvest browser cookies, autofill credentials from applications like Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, as well as data from Ledger, Trezor, and Binance wallets. Example of one of the fake meeting apps (Source: Cado Security ) Scammers employ very sophisticated social engineering techniques, including impersonating known contacts to discuss fake business opportunities. In one case, an attacker sent a victim an investment presentation from their own company. Others reported being on Web3-related calls, downloading the malicious software, and subsequently losing their cryptocurrency holdings. The attackers increase their credibility even more by setting up AI-generated company websites with blogs, product descriptions, and active social media profiles on platforms like X and Medium. These websites often contain Javascript that is capable of stealing crypto stored in web browsers, even before the malware is installed. Variants of the malware exist for both macOS and Windows. It is estimated that the scheme has been active for around four months. Former Celsius Executive's Sentencing Delayed In other crypto crime related news, Roni Cohen-Pavon, the former chief revenue officer of the collapsed crypto lending platform Celsius, will not face sentencing on Dec. 11 after an agreement between United States prosecutors and former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky. In a Dec. 9 court filing, Judge John Koeltl approved a request to delay Cohen-Pavon’s sentencing until after Mashinsky’s, which is scheduled for April of 2025. Prosecutors suggested that Cohen-Pavon’s cooperation might provide valuable information relevant to Mashinsky’s case. Cohen-Pavon pleaded guilty to four felony charges, including conspiracy to commit price manipulation, securities fraud, and wire fraud, and has been awaiting sentencing since his arrest in September of 2023. He initially pleaded not guilty but changed his plea after being indicted in July 2023 for misleading Celsius users and profiting from price manipulation alongside Mashinsky. Both parties are expected to report back to the court on April 18, 2025, when Judge Koeltl could decide Cohen-Pavon’s fate. Roni Cohen-Pavon Mashinsky, the former CEO, agreed to plead guilty to two charges earlier this month as part of a deal with prosecutors. He admitted to misleading users about regulatory approvals and concealing sales of his CEL token holdings. He also agreed to forfeit $48 million in proceeds from the fraudulent scheme. If convicted, Mashinsky could face up to 30 years in prison. The Celsius platform filed for bankruptcy in 2022 due to a massive market downturn that left millions of users unable to access billions of dollars in their accounts. The company’s collapse was one of the largest in the crypto space. In November, a bankruptcy court approved a reorganization plan that allows Celsius to distribute approximately $2 billion to creditors starting in 2025. Cohen-Pavon was allowed to travel between New York and Israel under a $500,000 bond and was permitted to travel to Singapore in September.

Took a Big Risk, Gained 7,500 Percent in XRP!","In the rally experienced by Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins, some altcoins outperformed others with their rise. One of these altcoins was undoubtedly XRP. At this point, XRP investors also made big money. According to Coindesk, an investor took advantage of XRP's 26% rise on Tuesday and bought $2,500 with 500x leverage. Accordingly, this investor turned his $2,500 into $200,000 by purchasing XRP futures with 500x leverage on the cryptocurrency exchange Rollbit. This smart investor opened a position with 500x leverage worth $2,560 when the XRP price was trading below $2. This meant that if XRP fell below $1.90, the entire position would be liquidated. The investor who took the big risk ended up winning, not losing. As the XRP price rose, the investor gradually closed his position between $2.13 and $2.29, earning a return of approximately 7,500%. XRP, which has risen by 7.7% in the last 24 hours and has separated itself from the market with its rise, continues to be traded at $2.36 at the time of writing. *This is not investment advice.

37505658,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=660653,1733923807,Tether’s USDT Hits New High—330 Million Wallets And Counting,"As of the end of Q3 2024, Tether’s USDT stablecoin has hit a new record with 330 million on-chain wallets. This shows that USDT is the market leader in stablecoins and is accompanied by an astounding rise in acceptability, particularly among small holders. Stablecoins are becoming more popular for a variety of financial transactions, including savings, remittances, and transactions, which is driving the rise. Related Reading: HBAR To Hit $100? Analyst Points To Utility And Market Cap Potential Unprecedented USDT Growth Among Small Holders According to Tether’s latest data, the number of wallets holding USDT has increased by 71% in just one year. This rise is primarily driven by wallets with balances under $1,000, demonstrating that daily consumers prefer the stablecoin for its convenience and dependability. In fact, around 18.7 million wallets contain less than $1 of USDT, demonstrating its utility as a financial tool for those with low resources. According to Tether’s data, approximately 30% of these smaller wallets are reactivated on a regular basis, implying that users continue to use the coin whenever funds are available. The substantial increase in wallet numbers can be linked to a variety of factors, including the aftermath of the FTX crash, which encouraged many users to self-manage their assets rather than rely on centralized systems. This move demonstrates a rising trust in USDT as a solid and secure option in the wake of market volatility. Dominance Over Competitors With over 109 million active on-chain wallets, USDT has surpassed Bitcoin and is closing up on Ethereum’s wallet count. Tether’s stablecoin accounts for 97.5% of the overall stablecoin supply, considerably outpacing competitors such as USDC and DAI. According to the report, USDT is stored in four times more wallets than all other stablecoins combined, cementing its status as the world’s leading stablecoin. Emerging markets play an important role in this growth story. Almost half of the web traffic to centralized exchanges comes from these countries, where USDT is used by most consumers for money remittances and everyday transactions. This situation illustrates how USDT narrows the gap between individuals and banks when it involves providing a trusty solution for saving funds and conducting payments without access to the banking system.

Liquidity crunch and overleveraged trades blamed for the sharp correction. Experts recommend holding positions and rebalancing portfolios. The altcoin market crashed 30% in the last 24 hours, with some coins losing half their value. This sharp drop, worsened by liquidity issues on major exchanges like Binance, raises concerns about the market’s uptrend. Following a two-month bull run, the altcoin market experienced its biggest liquidity crash in three years. Market experts blame overleveraged positions and dwindling liquidity for the flash crash across several altcoins. This includes notable losses in Bittensor, which lost 50% of its value. One key factor is overconfidence among investors who increased leverage as prices rallied. Despite the panic, analysts say this correction is a natural part of a healthy market cycle. They recommend rebalancing portfolios and avoiding impulsive decisions. Rebalancing helps investors preserve profits and prepares them to capitalize on future opportunities.

Crypto King Musk (MUSKKING), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKKING is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Crypto King Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crypto King Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Crypto King Musk launched with over $7,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Crypto King Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Crypto King Musk by entering its contract address – v2jWiNpR1m8gHARdM39GosZ8muaxZpowpBgWgWTSCev – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKKING.

With Ethereum surpassing the $4k mark recently and Bitcoin jumping over $100k, people are highly optimistic about the gains in the crypto market. However, with the Ethereum coin going out of the reach of a mass audience, Bitgert ’s $BRISE coin is growing rapidly and becoming popular among investors. Bitgert’s $BRISE coin has risen by over 17% in just a week and has given huge profits to its early investors. Currently soaring at just $0.0000001221 in the market, Bitgert’s $BRISE coin is the better option against the Ethereum coin. Ethereum’s Limitations in the Crypto World Ethereum coin has definitely been the cornerstone for blockchain technology and crypto's advancement. With smart contracts and the ability to host dApps, Ethereum coin paved the way for further innovations. However, the Ethereum coin has also lagged in several domains, which other altcoins like Bitgert’s $BRISE coin took advantage of. The high gas fee for each transaction, slow transaction speed, and the scalability issue, even with its transition to the Proof of Stake mechanism, have left developers and investors seeking alternatives like Bitgert . High demand for the Ethereum coin and its extensive use case are now making investors choose other options like Bitgert’s $BRISE coin. Enter Bitgert and its $BRISE Coin While people cannot invest in the Ethereum coin because of its pricing, Bitgert’s $BRISE coin is soaring through the market and establishing its position. Bitgert’s $BRISE coin is backed by the BRISE chain that offers solutions to the problems faced with the blockchain network of Ethereum coin. Bitgert’s BRISE chain functions using the Proof of Authority consensus mechanism that does not require a lot of validation while keeping the security intact. BRISE chain offers a speed of over 100k transactions per second at a nearly negligible transaction fee. Moreover, the Bitgert ecosystem is constantly evolving with partnerships like Coinhub, Dextools, Guardian, etc. Bitgert also has multiple innovative in-house platforms like PayBrise, BRISE P2P Marketplace, and a Web3 Real Estate Marketplace. All of these benefits encourage the users, developers, and investors to trust Bitgert’s $BRISE coin over Ethereum coin as it stands in the middle of the Bitgert ecosystem. Conclusion The market performance of Bitgert’s $BRISE coin is also much better than that of the Ethereum coin. While the Ethereum coin has climbed close to 18% in the last month, Bitgert’s $BRISE coin crossed over 45% of gains in the pricing. Also, Bitgert’s $BRISE coin is priced at just $0.0000001221, making it the investor favorite. The RSI index, MACD levels and other performance parameters also indicate a strong market indication towards buying Bitgert’s $BRISE coin over the Ethereum coin.

37505705,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=625935,1733923362,Wall Street banks bet US stocks will cool in 2025 as investors divest from AI boom,"This year, US stocks increased despite the current slowdown in the US economy. However, banks have anticipated that the US stock market may decline in the coming year due to investors’ waning confidence in technology companies’ ability to generate profits from their AI investments. Many investors had anticipated that the US economy would slow the S&P 500, but it has soared 28% this year due to significant gains in technology equities and Donald Trump’s presidential election victory. However, doubts regarding AI investment, along with a poor set of quarterly results, are causing investors to turn to other industries. How will the stock rally turn out? Stocks are expected to slow down Morgan Stanley, HSBC, and Goldman Sachs are among the ten major banks that anticipate that the S&P 500 index, the primary US equities barometer, will increase by approximately 8% to approximately 6,550. This estimation is between now and the end of the year, thus reaching new highs. However, when the next year begins, the expectation is that the stocks will slow down. Mike Wilson, chief investment officer for Morgan Stanley, said, “We’re fighting [. . .] euphoria that has helped people buy stocks versus the realities of next year.” Venu Krishna, a strategist at Barclays, also stated that there are “pockets of over-enthusiasm” in the industry. He explained that the technology giants have yet to demonstrate their ability to monetize their AI investments. He added, “We are cautious because it is unrealistic for these kinds of exceptional returns to continue.” US stocks performance since 1974 AI has been a great resource for US stocks. The US stock markets have achieved record highs this year due to the gains of tech giants such as Nvidia, which has increased by 180%, and Meta, the parent company of Facebook, which has increased by 73%. However, there is worry regarding the potential return on the substantial investment in AI made by these companies. In June, analysts at Goldman Sachs released a report entitled “Gen AI: too much spend, too little benefit?” The Wall Street bank inquired whether a $1 trillion investment in AI over the next few years will “ever pay off.” Sequoia Capital, an early investor in OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, also estimated that tech companies will need to earn $600 billion to make up for their AI investments. Wall Street expectations of US stocks performance in 2025 BofA predicted that the S&P will reach a benchmark of 6,666 by the end of the year, the mark of the bullish beast. The index is expected to increase by 10% from its current price of 6,050. Also, UBS Global Wealth Management anticipates the S&P will rise 10% to 6,600 by the end of 2025. BMO Capital Markets, on the other hand, anticipates an 11% increase in the S&P, with a price target of 6,700. Brian Belski, the chief investment strategist at BMO, hinted that there is a possibility of further gains as the Federal Reserve continues to reduce interest rates. Goldman Sachs predicted a 9% increase for the S&P next year at 6,500 in a client letter. However, Deutsche Bank has a Wall Street high end-of-2025 S&P price estimate of 7,000. The Binky Chadha-led strategist group expects around 16% more gains for American stocks. Analysts led by Savita Subramanian cited lower interest rates, higher labor market productivity, and a projected lower tax rate under President-elect Donald Trump as positive factors that could lead to the increase. Still, analysts have expressed concern that the inflationary impact of Trump’s second term in office, which could include tariffs on several countries, was still uncertain. In addition, Deutsche’s Chadha said, “We are in unfamiliar territory right now, and everyone talks about uncertainty. But I think the uncertainty is bigger on the upside.” A Step-By-Step System To Launching Your Web3 Career and Landing High-Paying Crypto Jobs in 90 Days.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wall-street-bet-us-stocks-will-cool-2025/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37505705.jpeg
37505441,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/mastercard-and-jpmorgan-embrace-blockchain-payment-solutions,1733923293,Mastercard and JPMorgan Embrace Blockchain Payment Solutions,"Mastercard and JPMorgan have collaborated on a new cross-border business-to-business payment solution. This partnership allows mutual customers of Mastercard's Multi-Token Network (MTN) and JPMorgan's Kinexys Digital Payments to process transactions seamlessly through a unified application programming interface (API) integration. Blockchain payment solutions are rapidly shaping the future of online transactions and capturing the attention of industries worldwide. With major financial players like Mastercard and JPMorgan at the forefront, everyone is watching closely to see how these innovations impact efficiency, transparency, and security in global commerce. Why is everyone adopting blockchain and crypto Cryptocurrency market activity has surged dramatically in recent years and it’s easy to see why. Much of the interest appears to stem from speculative investments, where individuals buy cryptocurrencies hoping to profit from price increases and adopt them as innovative payment systems. This speculative focus has contributed to the high price volatility observed across the market. For instance, Bitcoin's value soared from around $30,000 in mid-2021 to nearly $70,000 by late 2021, only to drop sharply to approximately $35,000 by early 2022. For most of 2023, Bitcoin's price exhibited significant recovery from the lows of 2022, fluctuating predominantly between $16,500 and $31,000. This year, however, Bitcoin has defied all expectations, breaking past its previous all-time high and setting new records. As of now, the most valuable cryptocurrency is on an impressive bull run poised to surpass $100,000. The surge was fueled by President Trump’s victory in the U.S. election and his reputation as a prominent advocate for crypto. The current market value of cryptocurrencies has risen by nearly $90 billion to more than $3.6 trillion which is a record high amid a surge in all major cryptocurrencies. It therefore makes sense that every online store, company, gaming, and entertainment platform is striving to integrate crypto into their payment platform. Alternative payment methods including Mastercard Blockchain’s rapid integration into finance showcases the increasing adoption of crypto-friendly platforms in various industries including entertainment and gaming. For instance, players exploring new no-deposit casino UK platforms can enjoy alternative payment methods such as PayPal and Mastercard. The heightened interest in cryptocurrencies has also led to increased computational demand as significant amounts of processing power are used to solve the complex algorithms essential for securing these decentralized systems. This ensures their integrity and resistance to tampering which further fuels the expansion of crypto mining activities. MTN partners up with Kinexys The collaboration between MTN and Kinexys aims to enhance payment accessibility, minimize ""time zone friction,"" and improve both transparency and settlement speed. Kinexys by JPMorgan co-head Naveen Mallela highlighted the significance of this integration, stating that the value proposition of commercial transaction venues is strengthened by the availability of commercial bank payment rails that seamlessly integrate with any digital marketplace or platform. MTN provides a suite of blockchain-powered tools that integrate with Kinexys Digital Payments’ payment rail to enable real-time transactions. Raj Dhamodharan, Mastercard's executive vice president of blockchain and digital assets, emphasized the significance of the partnership saying, “For years, both Mastercard and Kinexys by J.P. Morgan have focused on innovating for the future of digital assets and commercial infrastructure. We’re thrilled about this integration and the innovative use cases it will enable.” Unwrapping Kinexys Kinexys Digital Payments was originally launched in 2020 as Onyx and it marked the first bank-led blockchain platform utilizing the dollar-pegged JPM Coin for cross-border transactions. While initially met with skepticism from the crypto community, it quickly gained traction among financial institutions. Goldman Sachs was among its early adopters, followed by central and commercial banks in regions like India and the Middle East. By mid-2023, the platform had expanded to support euro-denominated payments, achieving $1 billion in daily transactions by October; a figure that has since doubled to $2 billion daily, according to JPMorgan. On Nov. 6, JPMorgan rebranded Onyx as Kinexys and announced its integration with JPMorgan FX Services. This collaboration enables on-chain foreign exchange settlements, starting with the US dollar and euro, further solidifying its role in streamlining global financial transactions. Kinexys also published a white paper showcasing a proof-of-concept focused on on-chain enterprise privacy, identity, and composability. Mastercard, meanwhile, began testing its Multi-Token Network (MTN) in June 2023. Its first live test took place in May 2024 when Mastercard, in collaboration with Standard Chartered Bank Hong Kong, piloted a proof-of-concept within the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Fintech Supervisory Sandbox. This project involved the tokenization of carbon credits. Additionally, MTN had previously explored wrapped central bank digital currencies in partnership with the Reserve Bank of Australia, demonstrating its versatility in advancing digital payment solutions. Benefits of Mastercard and J.P. Morgan’s integrated blockchain payment solutions The partnership aims to: Address challenges like time zone friction, settlement delays, and limited transparency Enable real-time transfers whereby mutual customers can settle transactions through a single API Integrate with digital asset infrastructures Reduce operational complexities Improve the speed and efficiency of cross-border payments Mastercard and J.P. Morgan’s collaboration will contribute to the ongoing transformation of the digital commerce ecosystem by streamlining blockchain-based B2B payments. The partnership is expected to embrace the full power of digital payments and align with the widespread adoption of digital currencies and decentralized financial systems.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. XRP’s meteoric rise steals the show in a bullish crypto market, but Rollblock emerges as a stable, long-term opportunity for investors seeking sustainable growth amid the volatility. Table of Contents Rollblock: The best-kept secret in the crypto market XRP: Riding the bull market to the max Solana: Dropped a place, still above BNB Conclusion The crypto market is on fire right now, with XRP not just in a bull market but an entire stampede. XRP has doubled in the last 7 days, dwarfing any other token and forcing Solana into a flatline. But Solana is not done yet, and XRP’s meteoric rise may be driven more by sentiment than fundamentals. One needs to be wary when things are going too well on the crypto market, and hedging against severe pullbacks is a wise idea. This is why Rollblock may just be the best token to invest in to bulwark against a wild and unpredictable crypto market. Rollblock: The best-kept secret in the crypto market The crypto market is ablaze, with Rollblock emerging as a standout contender in this bull market. As a GambleFi token, Rollblock bridges blockchain technology and the booming online gambling industry, offering investors a unique opportunity to benefit from both rapid growth and sustained value. Unlike tokens driven solely by sentiment, Rollblock is built on strong fundamentals. Its revenue-sharing model ensures consistent passive income for token holders. At the same time, its deflationary tokenomics creates scarcity and long-term value. The $7 million raised during its presale underscores growing investor confidence in Rollblock’s potential to outperform even established projects. Rollblock provides stability and growth in a volatile crypto market, making it a solid addition to any portfolio. Rollblock is positioning itself as a game-changing investment opportunity as the bull market charges towards a bullish 2025. XRP: Riding the bull market to the max Less than a month ago, one could get XRP at $0.50. Now, XRP is far above $2.60. XRP has taken off and shot up the charts faster than a new Taylor Swift album. To be fair, XRP was severely undervalued and the beleaguered token needed to regain some value, but delivering a 5x in a mere four weeks is grounds for celebration but also grounds for caution. No market is this bullish. It cannot hold. Nobody ever lost money by selling too early. 5x is an awesome return. There is no sin in taking profit from XRP and placing it on other coins with an equally bullish crypto market sentiment. Solana: Dropped a place, still above BNB A month ago, there was huge news when Solana flipped BNB as it spearheaded the bull market. Solana sitting at #4 looked great, but it is back at #5 after XRP flipped both Solana and Tether (USDT). All evidence shows that investors took their bull market winnings from Solana and reinvested in XRP. The market cap maths adds up to support this notion. Solana had a quiet week after a blistering November, and there are indicators that SOL will remain in a lull until the end of the year before the bull market takes over again in January. Conclusion Everyone loves it when the crypto market turns into a bull market, but be careful of things that are too good to be true. XRP going parabolic is delicious, but greed could be the death knell here. Slow and steady wins the race, and Solana seems to have this covered. However, the real winner in this market could be Rollblock, which delivers short-term explosive gains and long-term sustainability. Rollblock is now available at $0.041.

37505336,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=660796,1733923230,Lessons from $LUIGI as $SLAP Gains 220%,"As meme coins continue to win over the public’s hearts and wallets, analysts wrestle with their irreverent, often degenerate appeal. Take $Luigi, a meme token inspired by Luigi Mangione, the lead suspect in the December 4 shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO, Brian Thompson. The coin soared to a $77 million market cap just two days after launching earlier this week, in what can only be read as a protest against Mangione’s arrest on 9 December. Mangione has been cast as something of a hero for writing a manifesto against corporate greed and taking action in this ruthless hit-and-run shooting, which was recorded live and viewed by millions online. In a depraved response, the Luigi coin was then launched by anonymous crypto traders, and immediately started trending on Raydium , the automated market maker built on Solana. Hype-Coins Signal Public Sentiment Meme coins often pop up in response to viral content, news or popular culture events, and their value can fluctuate wildly, reflecting public sentiment towards these topics. While many are based on fairly innocuous memes, like dogs, cats and frogs, others are fueled by darker tropes, such as murder, suicide, cancer, or even swastikas. The Luigi coin, for example, seems to draw its strength from the latent anger common people hold for corporate greed. “As always, Solana meme coins are the best source of the news, as seen with the Luigi Mangione coin made minutes later,” said meme coin guru Burning Kitty on X . The $Luigi meme coin continues to feed off the hype around the story, but like most news-based meme coins, it’s highly volatile and has dropped to $29 million at the time of writing. Dark Energy Powers Meme Coins Similarly, coins like Catslap engage the public’s secret desire to perhaps b*tchslap some powerful people, as featured in the $SLAP website . These meme coins demonstrate that public anger can be funneled to send a token to the moon, but also, that acting on heated emotions may not be the best bet. That’s because, the more charged the issue, the more volatile the value, as we have seen with $LUIGI falling as fast as it rose. Meme tokens like $LUIGI lack the fundamental value and stability of traditional assets, making them highly volatile and risky investments, argues Alex Beene, Financial Literacy Instructor at University of Tennessee, in an interview with NewsWeek. “Typically rises in the value of a meme coin pertaining to a viral story or trend aren’t this gruesome, not to mention centering on criminal activity. Even if the flurry of buying activity is being done more out of novelty for the moment than as a sign of support, it definitely doesn’t speak highly to some in the crypto community” Beene adds. Analysts believe a wiser move, if you’re into irreverent meme coins, may be to look at something like Catslap ($SLAP). The token has seen a price surge of some 220% since listing on MEXC on December 6. This, following a 7,500% price gain since its launch on decentralized exchanges just two weeks ago. Catslap is audited by SolidProof, has a 99% project reliability score on DEXtools, and 53% of its $6.8 million liquidity is locked on-chain for one month. So rug pulls are unlikely. The token is also now one of the top swaps on crypto’s most-popular Ethereum wallet, Metamask. Liquidity looks deep at $6.5 million, and it’s locked for an extra six months to signal the team’s commitment to the project’s longevity. You can buy $SLAP on MEXC , Best Wallet , directly via the exchange widget on the Catslap website and on Uniswap DEX. $SLAP is gunning for a $100 million market capitalization, so act fast if you want to slap with the top cats.

37505368,https://coinpaper.com/6492/goldman-sachs-open-to-crypto-trading-if-us-regulations-evolve,1733923185,Goldman Sachs Open to Crypto Trading if US Regulations Evolve,"Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon recently hinted at the firm’s readiness to explore crypto markets if regulatory barriers are eased, reflecting Wall Street's cautious interest in the sector. Meanwhile, a prominent pro-crypto lobbying group is campaigning against the renomination of SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw, citing her perceived anti-crypto stance as a roadblock to innovation. Goldman Sachs CEO Hints at Crypto Expansion Amid Shifting US Regulations Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon revealed that the global investment giant may consider entering the Bitcoin and Ethereum markets if US regulatory conditions shift. Speaking at the Reuters Next conference on Tuesday, Solomon emphasized the constraints imposed by the current regulatory framework, while hinting at potential opportunities should these barriers evolve. During the conference, Solomon was pressed on whether Goldman Sachs plans to introduce spot Bitcoin trading. Solomon said Goldman Sachs' ability to participate in crypto is limited due to current regulations. When asked specifically about the firm’s potential role in making markets for Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH), Solomon was cautious but open-minded. “If the regulatory structure changes, we would evaluate that, but at the moment we're not permitted to,” he explained. The discussion comes at a pivotal time for the crypto industry in the US President-elect Donald Trump has promised a pro-crypto agenda, including the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve and an end to ”Operation Choke Point 2.0.” This initiative, referred to by some in the crypto space, is a callback to the 2013 Operation Choke Point, which sought to limit banking services for industries deemed high-risk for fraud and money laundering. Trump’s proposals signal a potential thaw in the regulatory climate for cryptocurrencies. Market optimism has surged following Trump’s pro-crypto rhetoric, with Bitcoin recently hitting an all-time high of $100,000. Additionally, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved spot Ethereum and Bitcoin ETFs, sparking a flurry of applications for funds tracking Solana (SOL) and XRP. Goldman Sachs has already dabbled in the cryptocurrency market. In 2021, the firm launched a crypto trading desk to cater to rising client demand. More recently, it participated in tests on the Canton Network, an interoperable platform designed for institutional assets developed by Digital Asset Holdings. The firm has also observed a resurgence in interest from hedge fund clients seeking exposure to crypto-related products. However, Solomon maintains a cautious stance, reiterating his view that assets like Bitcoin remain speculative. “These assets, Bitcoin for example, are speculative at the moment,” Solomon said. “But people are very interested in them, and I understand why.” Crypto’s Institutional Momentum Goldman Sachs’ exploration of crypto aligns with a broader institutional pivot toward digital assets. The past year has seen unprecedented developments, including the approval of spot ETFs and rising interest in blockchain technology. These advancements have been driven by increasing recognition of crypto’s potential to transform traditional finance. Yet, challenges remain. Regulatory clarity is a critical hurdle for firms like Goldman Sachs , which must navigate a complex and often restrictive landscape. Despite these barriers, Solomon’s remarks suggest that the firm is poised to act should the regulatory winds shift in favor of digital assets. Solomon’s comments show the growing intersection between Wall Street and the crypto sector. As regulatory conditions evolve, major financial institutions like Goldman Sachs are likely to play an increasingly prominent role in the market. For now, the firm remains in a holding pattern, awaiting clearer guidance from regulators. But the CEO’s willingness to ”evaluate” crypto opportunities signals a potential shift in strategy that could have far-reaching implications for both Goldman Sachs and the broader financial ecosystem. As the crypto industry continues to mature and regulatory frameworks adapt, the role of traditional financial giants in the digital asset market is set to expand. For investors and industry participants, all eyes will be on whether firms like Goldman Sachs fully embrace the crypto revolution. Crypto Advocacy Group Launches Campaign to Block SEC Nominee Caroline Crenshaw Meanwhile, a powerful crypto lobbying organization, the Cedar Innovation Foundation, has launched a digital campaign urging US lawmakers to oppose Caroline Crenshaw's renomination for a second term as a commissioner at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The campaign emphasizes growing tensions between the cryptocurrency industry and financial regulators amid contentious debates over innovation and market oversight. In a Dec. 9 notice, Cedar revealed a “five-figure, multi-channel” digital campaign targeting members of the Senate Banking Committee. The organization criticized Crenshaw for her perceived anti-crypto stance, claiming she is even more critical of the industry than SEC Chair Gary Gensler, particularly regarding policies like spot Bitcoin ETFs . “Last month, Americans voted for pro-innovation leadership, and this Sherrod Brown bait-and-switch directly defies the will of the voters,” Cedar stated, referring to Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, chair of the Senate Banking Committee. The Senate Banking Committee is scheduled to vote on Dec. 11 on whether to advance Crenshaw’s nomination to the full Senate. Her term officially expired in June 2024, though SEC commissioners can continue serving for up to 18 months after their terms end. If re-nominated and confirmed, Crenshaw could remain at the SEC until June 2029. The timing of the vote is critical, as Democrats maintain a slim majority in the Senate until Jan. 3, 2025, when the new Congress takes office with Republican control. Cedar's campaign is betting on pro-crypto lawmakers to block her renomination during this window. The crypto industry has frequently criticized Crenshaw for her regulatory stance. Many industry leaders perceive her as a staunch opponent of innovation, particularly in areas like spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have struggled to gain SEC approval despite growing institutional demand. Gensler, often seen as the face of the SEC’s crypto regulation efforts, announced plans to resign on Jan. 20, coinciding with Donald Trump’s return to the presidency. Trump has also indicated he will nominate former SEC commissioner Paul Atkins to replace Gensler, signaling a potential shift in the agency’s approach to crypto regulation. Cedar's campaign is part of a broader strategy to reshape the regulatory landscape for crypto in the United States. The foundation is closely linked to Fairshake, a political action committee (PAC) that spent $140 million supporting pro-crypto candidates during the 2024 elections. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has confirmed that Fairshake’s funding, backed by the crypto industry, played a decisive role in several key races. Fairshake’s efforts included a $40 million campaign supporting Republican Bernie Moreno, who defeated Sherrod Brown in Ohio’s Senate race. Brown, a vocal critic of the crypto industry, had been a key obstacle for pro-crypto legislation and regulatory reform. While Cedar and Fairshake claim to operate independently, the overlap in their leadership and funding sources has raised questions. Cedar has declined to disclose its donors, though reports suggest ties to other crypto-backed PACs, including HODLpac, which was co-founded by Cedar board member Tyler Whirty. A High-Stakes Battle for Crypto Regulation The Cedar campaign shines the spotlight on the growing power struggle between the crypto industry and traditional regulatory bodies. Crenshaw’s renomination has become a flashpoint, symbolizing broader debates over how the US should approach digital asset regulation. The stakes are high. If confirmed, Crenshaw’s extended term could influence the SEC’s policies on crypto for years to come. Conversely, her rejection would mark a significant victory for the crypto industry and signal a shift in the political tide. As the Senate Banking Committee prepares to vote, the outcome could set the tone for crypto regulation under the new administration. Cedar’s aggressive campaign reflects the crypto industry’s resolve to push back against regulatory frameworks it views as stifling innovation. Meanwhile, Fairshake has already announced plans to influence the 2026 midterm elections, with $103 million in funds available to support pro-crypto candidates. The crypto industry's deep pockets and increasing political clout suggest this battle is far from over. With the SEC leadership poised for significant changes and a divided Congress, the future of crypto regulation in the United States remains uncertain.

Tokens like DOGEN, POPCAT, and TURBO are disrupting the scene, capturing attention with their sudden surges. Explore how these digital assets are shaking up the crypto world and uncover the potential opportunities they might offer. DOGEN Rejoys Big Moment: Trump’s Victory Will Send It to the Moon Guess who is going to join Elon Musk’s moon mission soon? DOGEN, the boldest meme coin for alpha males, is gearing up for take-off as Trump's victory in the recent US election has the entire market euphoric about the prospects of cryptocurrencies, especially meme coins. Donald and Elon are Best Buddies for Meme Coins Donald Trump’s love for crypto is no secret — he’s promised to make the U.S. the global crypto leader in his campaign. And joining him is none other than Elon Musk, the ultimate Dogecoin (DOGE) fan who’s backed the crypto movement and even aligned with Republicans earlier this year. With these two icons fueling the fire, meme coins are set for a wild ride! DOGE Soars 130% in Just One Week! DOGEN will be the Next Star with 500% Surge Following the US election results, Dogecoin (DOGE) has been on a steady rise: from $0.15 to $0.39 in just one week. DOGEN follows the same upward trend, starting at $0.0003 and now trading at $0.0011, a staggering 300% leap. With a total of 13 presale stages, DOGEN is set to rise to $0.0019 by the token generation event (TGE), which represents a 500% increase from its initial price. Like it DOGE style? Grab Some DOGEN Now and Watch It Soars 500% A Community-Driven Token with Referral Program The backbone of DOGEN is its strong and engaged community—an energetic group of investors ready to seize the next big opportunity.

Flex Hard, Earn Big – DOGEN is Your Power Move! Popcat (POPCAT) Ready to Bounce Back After Recent Decline Popcat (POPCAT) is trading between $1.20 and $1.71. Though it has dropped in the past week and month, it's up over 270% in the last six months. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is around 30, indicating it may be oversold and could rebound soon. If Popcat moves past the nearby resistance at $1.90, it might reach the next level at $2.41, which is a significant increase from the current price. The simple moving averages suggest an upward trend could be on the horizon. With these signals, Popcat might be gearing up for a strong comeback. Turbo Coin Gains Momentum: Is a Surge Beyond Resistance Ahead? Turbo (TURBO) has climbed impressively, up over 30% this week. Trading between $0.0080 and $0.0132, it's approaching a key resistance at $0.0152. Indicators suggest it's oversold, pointing to potential upward movement. If it breaks above the 10-day average price, we might see it rise towards the next resistance around $0.0203. This could mean significant gains from current levels. With altcoin season on the horizon, Turbo could be gearing up for a strong bullish run. Conclusion In the current bullish market, coins like POPCAT and TURBO show limited short-term potential. Meanwhile, DOGEN emerges as the token for those seeking luxury and success, following the footsteps of successful tokens like BONK and WIF. By building a community of leaders and offering real benefits, DOGEN positions itself for remarkable achievements this altcoin season.

37506629,https://cryptonews.com/?p=318514,1733922870,"Russia Follows in U.S. Footsteps, State Deputy Pushes For Strategic Bitcoin Reserve","Anton Tkachev, a State Duma deputy from the New People Party, has proposed establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve in Russia. Tkachev reportedly sent the proposal to Russia’s finance minister, Anton Siluanov, to “assess the feasibility of creating a strategic reserve of bitcoin in Russia.” The document, cited by local Russian media , lays compelling arguments for Bitcoin as an alternative to traditional currency reserves. This development aligns with a growing global trend of governments considering Bitcoin as a reserve asset, spearheaded by the U.S. during Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. The Argument For a Russian Strategic Bitcoin Reserve In his proposal, Tkachev notes Bitcoin as a hedge against traditional currencies susceptible to volatility, sanctions, and inflation. Though, the driving point of his proposal was a call for innovative financial instruments, including alternative reserve assets independent of any single nation, to address modern geopolitical challenges. In conditions of limited access to traditional international payment systems for countries under sanctions, cryptocurrencies are becoming virtually the only instrument for international trade. He referenced the Central Bank of Russia’s ongoing efforts to trial cross-border crypto payments. Tkachev also noted Bitcoin as a store of value, citing its December rise to $100,000 as evidence of its potential to bring significant profits for state reserves. Despite these benefits, the proposition has not been met without controversy. Some view Bitcoin as a threat due to the significant influence the U.S. and its economy holds over the asset. Putin Eyes Bitcoin as a Geopolitical Hedge The proposal follows recent public endorsements made for cryptocurrencies by Russian President Vladimir Putin during a December 4th Investment Forum in Moscow, despite past skepticism. BREAKING: Russian President Putin says ""Who can ban #Bitcoin ? Nobody."" pic.twitter.com/6mJ664BZZ8 — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) December 4, 2024 Putin described the cryptocurrency as an “unstoppable technology,” appraising its potential as a global reserve asset. Similarly, Putin sees Bitcoin as a hedge against geopolitical challenges, citing Western nations’ freezing of $300 billion in Russian reserves after the 2022 Ukraine war as a key factor driving countries to explore alternatives like Bitcoin. Putin emphasized the advantage of decentralization, asserting, “Who can ban Bitcoin? Nobody. And who can prohibit the use of other electronic means of payment? Nobody.” The pivot began with the recent favorable crypto regulations , officially recognizing cryptocurrencies as property in Russia and exempting crypto mining and sales from value-added tax (VAT), along with other provisions.

Built on the Solana blockchain, this token is capturing attention with its astonishing potential for growth—projected to soar by up to 8,000%. The market is buzzing as investors keep a keen eye on this emerging crypto asset.

Shiba Inu (SHIB): An Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Growing Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency inspired by Dogecoin but operates on the Ethereum blockchain. Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous developer known as Ryoshi, it began with a supply of 1 quadrillion tokens. Half of these were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who donated some to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply. This increased SHIB's visibility. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB's base on Ethereum allows for advanced features like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange. Plans for a non-fungible token (NFT) platform and decentralized governance indicate potential growth. In the current market cycle, SHIB's expanding ecosystem could attract interest. Dogecoin: The Plentiful Meme Coin Turned Top Cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) was launched in 2013 as a fun alternative to other cryptocurrencies, featuring a Shiba Inu dog logo. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin has no maximum supply, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute. Initially seen as a ""memecoin,"" its value surged in 2021, reaching the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap. This rise was driven by social media buzz and support from figures like Elon Musk. Dogecoin showcases the power of community and social media in financial markets. Its potential lies in its widespread recognition and active community. In the current market cycle, Dogecoin remains a notable player due to its popularity and continued interest from investors. Conclusion While SHIB and DOGE show less short-term potential, DOGEN emerges as a token for those seeking luxury and success. With expected 700% growth by presale's end and potential for thousand-fold returns, DOGEN follows in the footsteps of tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat. Building a community of alpha leaders, it offers real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters.

37505177,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=109141,1733922839,Analysis: Bitcoin Struggles to Break $100K Amid Liquidity Decline and Nvidia Stock Slump,"Bitcoin (BTC) , the world’s largest cryptocurrency, has been stuck in the $90,000–$100,000 range for the past three weeks, unable to sustain a breakout above the six-figure mark. According to a report by CoinDesk , this stagnation is driven by two primary factors: a sharp decline in market liquidity and a slump in Nvidia’s (NVDA) stock price, which has historically correlated with Bitcoin. Data from 10X Research reveals a troubling drop in the market liquidity impulse index , a critical metric that tracks liquidity inflows from stablecoin issuance, spot BTC ETFs, and futures markets. The index has fallen by over 50%, plummeting from $15 billion in early November to $7 billion . Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s three-month correlation with Nvidia’s stock price currently sits at 0.6 , reflecting a strong positive relationship that may further complicate Bitcoin’s attempt to breach the $100,000 mark. The Liquidity Crisis: A Key Factor Behind Bitcoin’s Stagnation Liquidity is the lifeblood of any financial market, and its decline is proving to be a significant headwind for Bitcoin’s price growth. 1. Decline in Spot ETF Inflows Spot Bitcoin ETFs have been a major catalyst for Bitcoin’s price rally throughout 2024. These products provide regulated access to Bitcoin for institutional and retail investors, driving substantial inflows into the market. Current Situation : Spot ETF inflows have slowed significantly in recent weeks, reducing buying pressure. Implications : Without strong inflows, Bitcoin lacks the momentum to break critical resistance levels, including $100,000. 2. Stablecoin Issuance Drops Sharply Stablecoins like USDT and USDC are widely used in crypto markets to facilitate trading and liquidity. A decline in stablecoin issuance can indicate reduced trading activity. Data Insight : The market liquidity impulse index shows a sharp decline in stablecoin issuance, contributing to Bitcoin’s stagnation. Why It Matters : Lower stablecoin issuance means fewer funds are entering the market, limiting Bitcoin’s upside potential. 3. Futures Market Weakness Futures markets play a crucial role in price discovery for Bitcoin. Recent declines in futures trading volumes and open interest suggest reduced participation from traders. Market Trend : A drop in futures activity can signal waning interest, further dampening Bitcoin’s price action. The Nvidia Connection: A Surprising Correlation Bitcoin’s price has shown a strong positive correlation with Nvidia’s stock since both assets bottomed out in 2022. The current three-month correlation stands at 0.6 , indicating a significant relationship between the two. Why Nvidia Matters to Bitcoin AI and Crypto Synergies Nvidia’s dominance in artificial intelligence (AI) and GPU manufacturing positions it as a critical player in the crypto mining ecosystem. As Nvidia’s stock price rises, it often reflects optimism in the tech and crypto sectors, benefiting Bitcoin. Market Sentiment Nvidia is considered a bellwether for innovation-driven markets. A slump in its stock price can dampen sentiment in correlated sectors, including cryptocurrency. Current Scenario Nvidia’s stock has recently faced a pullback amid concerns over slowing AI chip demand and macroeconomic pressures. This slump has contributed to Bitcoin’s inability to gain traction above $100,000. What’s Holding Bitcoin Back? Bitcoin’s struggles to breach $100,000 can be attributed to a combination of external and market-specific factors: 1. Macro-Economic Headwinds Global economic uncertainties, including rising interest rates and geopolitical tensions, have weighed on risk assets like Bitcoin. 2. Regulatory Concerns Ongoing regulatory debates, particularly around stablecoins and cryptocurrency taxation, are adding to market hesitation. 3. Profit-Taking at Key Levels As Bitcoin approaches $100,000, profit-taking by traders and long-term holders creates selling pressure, preventing a clear breakout. Historical Context: Bitcoin’s Battle with Psychological Levels Bitcoin has historically faced resistance at major psychological price levels. Breaking through these levels often requires a confluence of favorable factors, including strong liquidity, positive sentiment, and external catalysts. Previous Milestones $10,000 in 2017 : Bitcoin faced months of consolidation before finally breaking through. $20,000 in 2020 : The level was only breached after significant institutional adoption and macroeconomic tailwinds. The current battle at $100,000 mirrors these earlier struggles, highlighting the importance of liquidity and sentiment in driving Bitcoin’s price action. What Needs to Happen for Bitcoin to Break $100K? Breaking through the $100,000 barrier will require a reversal of the current liquidity and sentiment challenges. 1. Renewed ETF Inflows A resurgence in spot ETF inflows could provide the buying pressure needed to push Bitcoin above its resistance level. 2. Stablecoin Market Recovery Increased stablecoin issuance would inject much-needed liquidity into the market, supporting higher Bitcoin prices. 3. Positive Correlation with Tech Stocks A recovery in Nvidia and other tech stocks could boost sentiment and help Bitcoin regain bullish momentum. 4. Broader Institutional Participation Greater involvement from institutional investors, particularly through regulated channels like ETFs, would provide long-term support for Bitcoin’s price growth. Potential Risks and Challenges While Bitcoin’s long-term outlook remains bullish, several risks could delay its ascent beyond $100,000: 1. Continued Liquidity Decline If liquidity inflows continue to drop, Bitcoin’s upward momentum could stall further. 2. Regulatory Crackdowns Stringent regulations, especially around stablecoins and ETFs, could create headwinds for the market. 3. Global Economic Downturn A recession or other macroeconomic shocks could reduce risk appetite among investors, negatively impacting Bitcoin. Conclusion Bitcoin’s current struggle to break $100,000 highlights the importance of liquidity and market sentiment in driving its price action. Declining ETF inflows, reduced stablecoin issuance, and a slump in Nvidia’s stock are key factors contributing to its stagnation. However, Bitcoin has overcome similar challenges in the past, and its long-term growth potential remains intact. Renewed liquidity inflows, positive macroeconomic developments, and broader adoption could provide the necessary catalysts for Bitcoin to finally breach the six-figure mark.

37505132,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=109096,1733922739,Eric Trump Predicts Bitcoin Will Surpass $1 Million Amid U.S. Push for Crypto Leadership,"At the largest Bitcoin MENA Conference in the Middle East and North Africa, Eric Trump , son of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, made a bold prediction: Bitcoin will surpass $1 million per coin . His remarks, reported by Bitcoin Magazine on X, highlight the growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential and the United States’ increasing focus on cryptocurrency innovation. In a prior interview with CNBC, Trump stated that his father’s administration aims to position the U.S. as the world’s cryptocurrency capital , signaling a significant policy shift toward embracing digital assets. Bitcoin’s Path to $1 Million Eric Trump’s prediction of Bitcoin surpassing $1 million underscores the cryptocurrency’s growing role as a store of value and its adoption on a global scale. Factors Supporting the Prediction : Institutional Adoption : Major companies like MicroStrategy , BlackRock , and Tesla are adding Bitcoin to their portfolios, driving demand. Finite Supply : Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million coins creates scarcity, a key factor in long-term price appreciation. Global Acceptance : Nations and corporations are increasingly integrating Bitcoin into their financial systems, boosting its utility and value. Expert Perspectives While Trump’s $1 million prediction is ambitious, many industry leaders have speculated on similar outcomes, driven by: Bitcoin’s deflationary nature. Its emerging role as digital gold . The U.S. Push to Become a Crypto Leader Trump Administration’s Crypto Vision Eric Trump’s comments suggest a strong focus from the incoming administration to position the U.S. as a global leader in cryptocurrency innovation. Key initiatives could include: Supportive Regulations : Creating clear frameworks to foster innovation while protecting investors. Encouraging Blockchain Development : Promoting blockchain as a transformative technology across industries. Public and Private Partnerships : Collaborating with leading crypto companies to boost adoption and technological advancement. Why This Matters If successful, the U.S. could attract: Global Investments : As a crypto-friendly hub. Top Talent : Innovators and developers from around the world. Technological Leadership : Strengthening its position in the evolving digital economy. Bitcoin’s Current Market Trends Price Overview Bitcoin recently fluctuated around $11,400 to $12,000 , showcasing its characteristic volatility. However, sustained institutional interest and bullish market sentiment signal potential for growth. Market Drivers Macroeconomic Factors : Inflation concerns and monetary easing continue to push investors toward Bitcoin as a hedge. Technological Advancements : Developments in Layer-2 solutions and scalability improvements bolster Bitcoin’s utility. Skepticism and Challenges While Eric Trump’s prediction excites enthusiasts, achieving a $1 million valuation is not without challenges: 1. Market Volatility Bitcoin’s price swings could deter risk-averse investors. 2. Regulatory Uncertainty The global regulatory landscape remains fragmented, with some nations imposing restrictions on crypto usage. 3. Competition from Altcoins Emerging cryptocurrencies like Ethereum , Solana , and Cardano offer unique use cases, potentially diverting attention from Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s Role in the Global Economy As Bitcoin inches closer to mainstream adoption, it is transforming the financial landscape: 1. Hedge Against Inflation Bitcoin’s scarcity and decentralized nature make it an attractive alternative to fiat currencies, especially during economic uncertainty. 2. Cross-Border Transactions Its borderless nature enables faster, cheaper international transactions compared to traditional banking systems. 3. Store of Value Often referred to as digital gold , Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a reliable store of value for long-term investors. The Implications of U.S. Leadership in Cryptocurrency If the U.S. establishes itself as the global cryptocurrency capital, it could: Drive Adoption : Encourage businesses and individuals to adopt crypto for everyday use. Boost Economic Growth : Create jobs and attract investment in the blockchain sector. Influence Global Standards : Shape international regulations to align with U.S. interests. Eric Trump’s remarks indicate that the incoming administration recognizes cryptocurrency’s potential to redefine global finance and is committed to fostering its growth. Conclusion Eric Trump’s prediction that Bitcoin will surpass $1 million highlights the growing confidence in the cryptocurrency’s future. With the U.S. positioning itself as a global leader in the crypto space under the incoming Trump administration, the stage is set for significant advancements in adoption, regulation, and innovation. While challenges like volatility and regulatory uncertainty remain, Bitcoin’s deflationary design, increasing institutional support, and role as a hedge against inflation make it a compelling asset for the long term.

37505139,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/demonopol-shakes-the-real-estate-industry-with-rwa-on-the-blockchain,1733922718,DeMonopol Shakes the Real Estate Industry with RWA on the Blockchain,"DeMonopol , a newly launched real estate blockchain project, announced on November 23, 2024, the launch of its improved tokenomics, an action made possible by a series of strategic partnerships. The announcement was made on the project’s X (Twitter) and Medium accounts. New Partnerships Lead to Improved Tokenomics DeMonopol , the revolutionary RWA (Real-World Asset) real estate blockchain-based project, has recently announced that it would launch an improved version of its tokenomics thanks to the “strategic onboarding of significant partners,” such as Supra Oracle that they officially announced recently. According to DeMonopol’s statement from November 23, the company's improved tokenomics has been carefully crafted to: Control sell pressure; Reward long-term holders; Incentivize early adopters and holders; Extend and even improve decentralization. A low initial market cap can attract new traders. All these changes come as DeMonopol focuses on 4 main pillars to grow constantly and offer increasingly more user benefits. First, the project wants to reach a higher fundraising potential. To achieve this, the company plans to adjust pricing to align with its target of $42.3 million while also keeping the allocation ratios consistent. The controlled sell pressure is part of DeMonopol’s plan because, through longer lock-ups and gradual vesting, the project can ensure a stable token release schedule. Another pillar is marketing synergy. Strategic airdrops and PR campaigns can attract users and maintain the hype created around a specific project, so DeMonopol aims to leverage them to increase its popularity significantly. Last but definitely not least, DeMonopol wants to ensure sustainable growth by controlling its native token’s liquidity to maintain a healthy market dynamic. Clever Co-Launch in the Making DeMonopol did not stop at strategic partnerships and improved tokenomics to make real estate better - it has also developed DeMonopoly, a game designed to educate users and further drive conversion with the first property on the platform going to the top players of the leaderboard. DeMonopoly invites users to embark on a journey across a globe-shaped game board, where they can explore various civilizations from ancient times to the modern era. Each region has unique historical or cultural settings, and players can acquire land, build infrastructure, and tackle local challenges to improve the area and turn it into a prosperous region. Your goal in DeMonopoly is to establish impactful developments globally by solving regional challenges, building infrastructure, and uplifting civilizations. All players can earn points by achieving this, the number of points being in accordance with their success. The player with the most points wins. DeMonopoly is slightly similar to Monopoly. However, the main difference is that players compete to grow and improve the areas they land in instead of monopolising them. First, you roll the dice (turns occur every 3 hours and accumulate if not used immediately). Then, you land on a property square. There, the next action strongly depends on whether you own the square. Here is the Monopoly resemblance. DeMonopoly will also allow users to participate in quizzes or earn more through the referral system. The latter is designed to amplify network effects, rewarding users for growing the community. DeMonopoly is set to launch soon, and DeMonopol is working tirelessly to make it available as soon as possible. About DeMonopol DeMonopol RWA (Real World Asset) is a new crypto project revolutionizing real estate by reversing Monopoly. It is a blockchain-based game that leverages the power of DeFi (Decentralized Finance), gamification, and DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization, a concept that DeMonopol aims to build by 2027) to make real estate better than it has ever been. The project is built as an Omni-Blockchain Application (OBA) and enables fractional ownership of high-value properties, offering surprising investment opportunities to all its users. DeMonopol is now organizing a token presale that users can access by visiting its official website . It also announced that it would organize a special contest in which users can win an RWA.

Despite a recent dip of about 8% in the last week, it remains strong within the $0.23 to $0.41 range. The price is approaching the resistance level at $0.50. If it surpasses this level, the next target could be around $0.68. The relative strength index is near the neutral zone, indicating potential for upward movement. With the anticipated altcoin season and an expected global crypto bull run, HBAR could see significant gains ahead. NEAR Protocol Eyes Significant Gains as Altcoin Season Approaches NEAR Protocol (NEAR) has shown impressive growth over the past month, surging nearly 39%. Despite a recent dip of about 14% in the last week, the coin remains in a healthy range between $6.75 and $8.58. The RSI sits around 39, hinting that NEAR may be oversold and ripe for a rebound. If it breaks through the nearest resistance at $9.32, the next target is $11, which would mark a substantial increase. With the altcoin season on the horizon and a global crypto bull run expected, NEAR Protocol could be poised for significant gains in the near future. Aave (AAVE) Eyes Bullish Surge Towards $448 Resistance Aave (AAVE) is trading between $225.61 and $318.91, showing momentum toward higher levels.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 58.02, suggesting the coin isn't overbought yet. With the nearest resistance at $354.87, breaking this level could propel AAVE toward the next target of $448. This move would represent a potential gain of around 40% from current prices. The MACD level of 2.82 and a stochastic of 75.73 support a bullish outlook. With these indicators aligning, AAVE could be gearing up for a significant rise. JasmyCoin Soars Nearly 100% in a Month: Is a Breakout Imminent? JasmyCoin has surged over 90% in the past month, trading between $0.0327 and $0.0636. This strong upward movement brings it close to the nearest resistance level at $0.0769. Breaking this barrier could see the coin aiming for the next target of $0.1077, signaling substantial growth potential. The 10-day moving average is approaching the 100-day average, hinting at building bullish momentum. With the Relative Strength Index at 42.11 and the MACD turning less negative, indicators suggest room for further gains. However, it's important to watch the support level at $0.0152. If the current trend continues, JasmyCoin might be gearing up for a significant uptrend in the anticipated altcoin season. Conclusion While HBAR, NEAR, AAVE, and JASMY show less short-term promise, DOGEN stands out. Designed for those who seek success and luxury, it is expected to grow by 700% by the end of its presale, with potential for massive returns this altcoin season. Following tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat, DOGEN is building a community of leaders with real benefits for early adopters.

37505191,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=625990,1733922586,Polkadot 2.0 To Deliver Higher Scalability as Stellar Gains Price Momentum; Lunex Network Set for 100X Surge This Bull Cycle,"The DeFi market is witnessing a rapid growth with top altcoins like Polkadot (DOT) and Stellar (XLM) leading the way with innovations and monumental growth. Recently, Polkadot network announced that it will be integrating new functionalities as part of its 2.0 launch in Q1 2025. Meanwhile, even with the promising developments set in stone for Polkadot and the recent surge Stellar token witnessed from Grayscale inflows, investors still have their eyes fixated elsewhere. Namely Lunex Network (LNEX) , the rast-rising non-custodial crypto networks has been speculated to have a 50x surge on launch-day and 100x or more this bull cycle. Polkadot 2.0 Sets to Skyrockets Its Network Scalability After already surpassing 60 million transactions, marking a new all-time high TPS record, Polkadot (DOT) is planning even better developments to upgrade its network. Few days back, the network announced that it will be integrating major upgrades such as the Agile Coretime, Asynchronous Backing and Elastic Scaling. Set to launch in Q1, 2025, all of these features aim to enhance developer accessibility, flexibility, and scalability on the Polkadot network. According to Chetan Guirjar , the Polkadot price has also broken out of its weekly accumulation zone and is set to test $23.8 from its current $9.20 to $9.70 price range. Meanwhile, the upcoming Polkadot 2.0 features, coupled with its positive price sentence has strengthened investors’ confidence in Polkadot price. Albeit, Natalie Dormer , another market analyst, has advised to remain cautious as potential dips could take $DOT to as low as $7.50. Stellar Token Struggles to Maintain Price Positivity In the past month, Stellar (XLM) token recorded a whopping 350% surge in its price, as observed on CoinMarketCap . However, the past week has been less favorable as Stellar concluded an 11% decline falling below its weekly resistance of $0.5038. Regardless, the recent surge in the price of Stellar is a noteworthy one in the DeFi market as the top cryptocurrency have navigated a bearish tide from January till November. Now that Stellar has broken out its year-long bearish pattern, Mario Nawfal’s Roundtable on X (formerly Twitter) predicts a further surge to $0.79 for the token. Stellar token is still comfortably holding in a weekly range of $0.453 and $0.573, allowing it to reflect a 47.9% gap from its ATH. Following Franklin Templeton’s plan to put $1.7 trillion into the Stellar network, the network could reach as high as $7 as ALLINCRYPTO predicts . Lunex Network Achieves Massive Milestone, Ranks Among Top Investments In 2025 Lunex Network (LNEX) functions as a decentralized and non-custodial crypto network with features that allows it to transcend mere exchange platforms. Given its KYC-absent feature, Lunex Network allows investors to swap over 50,000 types of cryptocurrencies across multi chains by connecting isolated blockchains together. The DeFi protocol adds to its allure by offering the cheapest trading fees and eliminating the need for third party wallets. On top of that, Lunext network plans to revolutionize the DeFi market by integrating its network with RPC nodes to allow Web3 development. This distinct innovation coupled with its portfolio tracking and swap-revenue share has bolstered investor confidence in its ability to actually rally 100x this bull run. Meanwhile, having raised nearly $5 million in presale revenue, it’s safe to say this network has achieved a massive milestone. Besides, its native token, LNEX has completed a 217% surge to arrive at its current value of $0.0038. However due to growing demand for its token which is slated to give an 18% APR from staking activities, its value could test $0.5 before the end of this bull cycle and $1 later in 2025. How Much Higher Can Lunex Network Grow Than Polkadot and Stellar? Both Polkadot (DOT) and Stellar (XLM) are over 100% above their prices in the past month, with Stellar price securing a massive year-to-date pump. However, Lunex Network may be on a better trajectory with how rapid its presale is growing. Considering its untapped potential as a DeFi protocol, this altcoin is likely to achieve over a 100x surge by 2025.

37505082,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=109103,1733922566,Ray Dalio Champions Gold and Bitcoin as Global Debt Concerns Loom,"Renowned billionaire investor Ray Dalio , founder of Bridgewater Associates , has urged investors to consider “hard money” assets like gold and Bitcoin over traditional debt-based investments such as bonds. Speaking at a financial conference in Abu Dhabi , Dalio outlined his concerns about the unsustainable levels of global debt, particularly in the United States and China , and warned of inevitable debt crises and currency devaluation in the coming years. Dalio’s remarks come at a time of growing economic uncertainty fueled by rising global debt, geopolitical tensions, technological disruptions, and the increasing impact of climate change. His call for diversification and long-term investment strategies reflects a pragmatic approach to navigating today’s complex financial landscape. Global Debt: A Mounting Crisis Unprecedented Debt Levels Major economies are grappling with record-high debt, which has been exacerbated by: Excessive Borrowing : Governments and corporations have relied heavily on debt to finance operations and stimulus programs. Monetary Easing : Central banks have implemented policies like quantitative easing , flooding economies with liquidity at the expense of long-term fiscal stability. Key Figures : United States : The U.S. national debt has surpassed $33 trillion , with interest payments alone becoming a significant fiscal burden. Rising interest rates compound this challenge, increasing the cost of servicing debt. China : China faces mounting corporate and local government debt, which threatens to destabilize its economy amid slower growth and a struggling real estate sector. Global Impact : According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) , global debt reached an all-time high of $307 trillion in 2023, equivalent to 348% of global GDP . Such unsustainable levels of debt risk triggering financial crises and prolonged economic stagnation. The Case for Hard Money: Gold and Bitcoin Dalio emphasized the importance of assets like gold and Bitcoin, which are not tied to the liabilities of governments or corporations, as reliable stores of value during times of economic distress. Gold’s Historical Role Inflation Hedge : Gold has long been regarded as a safe-haven asset that protects wealth during periods of inflation and currency devaluation. Universal Acceptance : Gold’s intrinsic value and global recognition make it a cornerstone of traditional financial portfolios. Bitcoin’s Emergence as Digital Gold Finite Supply : Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins makes it inherently deflationary, contrasting sharply with fiat currencies that can be printed at will. Decentralization : Bitcoin operates on a decentralized blockchain, making it immune to government interference and monetary policies. Technological Appeal : Bitcoin’s borderless nature and ease of transfer provide a modern alternative for wealth preservation. Dalio’s Broader Investment Philosophy Beyond advocating for gold and Bitcoin, Dalio encourages investors to adopt a comprehensive approach to managing financial risks: 1. Diversify Across Asset Classes Diversification minimizes exposure to the vulnerabilities of any single asset type or market. Example : Combining traditional assets like equities and bonds with alternatives like real estate, commodities, and cryptocurrencies. 2. Prepare for Geopolitical Risks Global tensions, such as trade conflicts and regional disputes, can have significant economic repercussions. Investors should: Monitor geopolitical developments. Adjust portfolios to hedge against potential risks. 3. Embrace Long-Term Thinking Dalio emphasizes patience and a focus on long-term growth rather than short-term gains. This approach is particularly important during periods of volatility and uncertainty. 4. Account for Climate Change As environmental concerns shape policies and markets, Dalio advises considering the impact of climate risks and regulations on investments. Debt and Currency Devaluation Dalio warns that unsustainable debt levels will likely lead to: 1. Debt Crises Governments may struggle to meet repayment obligations, triggering defaults and economic instability. Debt restructuring and austerity measures could have widespread social and economic consequences. 2. Currency Devaluation To manage debt burdens, central banks may resort to printing money, diluting the value of fiat currencies. Currency devaluation erodes purchasing power, disproportionately affecting savers and fixed-income earners. Dalio’s focus on gold and Bitcoin stems from their ability to act as safe havens in such scenarios. Challenges and Opportunities for Bitcoin While Bitcoin offers significant advantages, it also faces hurdles that could influence its adoption: Advantages : Hedge Against Inflation : Bitcoin’s deflationary design makes it an attractive alternative to fiat currencies. Institutional Adoption : Companies like MicroStrategy , Tesla , and BlackRock have incorporated Bitcoin into their investment strategies, validating its legitimacy. Accessibility : Bitcoin’s digital nature allows for seamless cross-border transactions, particularly in regions with unstable currencies. Challenges : Volatility : Bitcoin’s price fluctuations can deter risk-averse investors. Regulatory Uncertainty : Governments worldwide are still formulating policies to regulate cryptocurrency markets. Competition : Emerging cryptocurrencies like Ethereum , Solana , and Cardano offer diverse use cases, potentially diverting attention from Bitcoin. Comparing Gold and Bitcoin: Complementary Assets Dalio views gold and Bitcoin as complementary investments, each offering unique benefits: Feature Gold Bitcoin History Established safe-haven asset Emerging digital store of value Volatility Relatively stable Highly volatile Accessibility Requires physical storage Easily transferable digitally Scarcity Limited global supply Capped at 21 million coins By combining both assets, investors can balance stability and growth potential in their portfolios. The Role of Diversification in Today’s Market Dalio’s emphasis on diversification aligns with the evolving financial landscape: Rising Inflation : Calls for inflation-resistant assets like commodities and cryptocurrencies. Technological Disruption : Encourages investment in innovative sectors to capitalize on growth opportunities. Sustainable Investments : Growing focus on ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) principles requires integrating green technologies into portfolios. Conclusion Ray Dalio’s advocacy for gold and Bitcoin highlights the growing appeal of hard money assets in a world grappling with rising debt and economic uncertainty. As global debt reaches unprecedented levels and the risk of currency devaluation looms, these assets offer a hedge against inflation and financial instability. Dalio’s insights underscore the importance of long-term thinking , diversification , and adapting to emerging challenges such as geopolitical tensions and climate change. While gold provides historical reliability, Bitcoin’s technological advantages position it as a vital component of modern investment strategies. Investors looking to navigate today’s complex financial environment should consider the benefits of incorporating hard money assets like gold and Bitcoin into a balanced portfolio.

37505035,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=109105,1733922496,Anthony Scaramucci Predicts China to Adopt Bitcoin Reserves Amid Global Shift,"At the Bitcoin MENA 2024 Conference , former White House Communications Director and hedge fund manager Anthony Scaramucci made a bold prediction: China could reintegrate Bitcoin into its reserves and legalize mining by 2025 . This move, he suggested, would align with a broader global trend of nations exploring Bitcoin as a strategic financial asset. His remarks, reported by CryptoSlate , come at a time when Bitcoin is experiencing a post-halving rally, stabilizing near $97,000 and cementing its role as a transformative force in global finance. China’s Evolving Stance on Bitcoin Past Restrictions China has historically taken a hardline stance against Bitcoin, imposing bans on: Cryptocurrency Mining : Citing environmental concerns and financial stability. Trading and Usage : Declared illegal in 2021, forcing many exchanges and miners to relocate. Despite these measures, China’s citizens and underground market have maintained a connection to cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin’s decentralized nature proving resilient to restrictions. Why China May Reconsider Bitcoin Reserves 1. Global Trend Toward Bitcoin Reserves Scaramucci noted that nations such as Russia , Brazil , and the United States are exploring Bitcoin reserves to enhance financial resilience. 2. Strategic Asset for Economic Strength Bitcoin offers a hedge against fiat currency devaluation and inflation. Holding Bitcoin as a reserve asset could diversify China’s existing foreign currency reserves. 3. Technological Leadership Reintegrating Bitcoin mining could reestablish China’s dominance in blockchain innovation and cryptocurrency infrastructure. Legalizing mining could align with China’s ambition to lead in green technology , leveraging renewable energy for sustainable mining. Post-Halving Rally and Bitcoin’s Stabilization Bitcoin’s price stabilization near $97,000 post-halving signals its growing maturity and appeal as a strategic asset: Why the Halving Matters Bitcoin’s halving event , which reduces mining rewards, creates scarcity, historically driving up its price. Institutional interest and adoption often surge after halvings, as the asset’s deflationary nature becomes more apparent. Current Market Dynamics Stable Growth : Bitcoin’s price stability near $97,000 reflects increased confidence from institutional investors. Geopolitical Relevance : As countries explore Bitcoin reserves, the cryptocurrency gains recognition as a legitimate financial tool. Scaramucci’s Broader Insights Anthony Scaramucci’s prediction underscores the growing importance of Bitcoin in global finance. He emphasized that Bitcoin’s appeal lies in its: Decentralized Design : Immune to monetary policy manipulation. Scarcity : With a capped supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin is deflationary by nature. Resilience : Thrives amid economic uncertainty and geopolitical shifts. Scaramucci’s perspective aligns with Bitcoin’s evolving role from a speculative investment to a strategic asset held by nations and institutions. China’s Role in Global Bitcoin Mining Historical Dominance Before its mining ban in 2021, China was the world leader in Bitcoin mining, accounting for over 65% of global hashrate . Potential Reentry Relegalizing Bitcoin mining could: Reclaim China’s position as a major player in cryptocurrency production. Bolster its economy by attracting investment in renewable energy-powered mining operations. Support technological advancements in blockchain applications. Global Shift Toward Bitcoin Reserves Examples of Adoption Russia : Exploring Bitcoin as a reserve asset amid sanctions and economic isolation. Brazil : Investigating Bitcoin’s potential to stabilize foreign currency reserves. United States : Increasing institutional adoption signals potential government interest in Bitcoin reserves. Strategic Implications As more nations embrace Bitcoin, its role as a global reserve asset could challenge the dominance of traditional currencies like the U.S. dollar. Challenges for China and Global Adoption While Scaramucci’s prediction is promising, several challenges remain: 1. Regulatory Uncertainty China’s historically stringent crypto policies may create hurdles for reintegration. 2. Environmental Concerns Bitcoin mining’s energy consumption could clash with China’s ambitious carbon neutrality goals . 3. Geopolitical Tensions Adopting Bitcoin reserves could intensify competition with other nations, particularly the United States, in the race for cryptocurrency dominance. Future Outlook for Bitcoin in Global Finance As nations like China reconsider their stance on Bitcoin, its role in global finance is poised to expand: 1. Broader Adoption Nations integrating Bitcoin into reserves could drive demand and push prices higher. Increased legitimacy may accelerate mainstream acceptance and usage. 2. Technological Innovation Governments and institutions could invest in blockchain infrastructure, advancing the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. 3. Economic Resilience Bitcoin offers a hedge against fiat currency volatility, providing stability in uncertain economic times. Conclusion Anthony Scaramucci’s prediction that China may adopt Bitcoin reserves and legalize mining by next year signals a transformative moment for global finance. As Bitcoin stabilizes near $97,000 , its appeal as a strategic asset continues to grow, prompting nations like Russia, Brazil, and the U.S. to explore its potential as a reserve asset. If China reenters the Bitcoin ecosystem, it could redefine its role in cryptocurrency markets, reignite its dominance in mining, and enhance its financial resilience. While challenges like regulatory uncertainty and environmental concerns remain, the potential benefits of adopting Bitcoin are too significant to ignore.

NEIRO's price has dipped recently, but signs point to a potential rebound. The coin is trading between $0.001657 and $0.002101, just above its 10-day moving average. With the RSI at 36.66, NEIRO is nearing oversold territory, which could signal a bullish reversal. If the price breaks above the nearest resistance at $0.002306, it might climb to the next level at $0.002750. That would be a significant gain from current levels. Despite short-term losses, NEIRO's 6-month price change is an impressive +4809%, showing strong long-term growth. This could be the perfect time to watch NEIRO for a potential breakout. Catwifhat (CWIF) Poised for Gains Amid Altcoin Season Buzz Catwifhat (CWIF) is trading between $0.0000003483 and $0.0000004493, showing signs of stabilization after recent declines. The Relative Strength Index stands at 51.05, indicating neutral momentum that could shift positively. With the nearest resistance level at $0.0000004886, breaking above it may signal a move toward the next resistance at $0.0000005896. The Stochastic indicator at 62.67 supports this potential upward movement. While the MACD level is slightly negative, the anticipation of an altcoin season and a global crypto bull run might influence CWIF's trajectory. If key resistance levels are surpassed, CWIF could experience notable percentage increases, drawing attention from traders looking for growth opportunities. Super Trump (STRUMP) Shows Signs of Rebound Amid Altcoin Season Buzz Super Trump (STRUMP) has seen a notable price surge of 32.38% over the past week, trading within the $0.001975-$0.00385 range. The nearest resistance level sits at $0.004575; surpassing this could open the path to the next target. The Stochastic oscillator is at 13.21, indicating oversold conditions, while the RSI stands at 44.76, suggesting potential upward momentum. The 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are close, hinting at a possible trend reversal. Despite a significant drop over six months, the recent positive movement may signal a turnaround for STRUMP.

Being below the 100-day average of $0.000003654 suggests room for upward movement. Breaking the nearest resistance at $0.000005295 could propel MOG upwards by approximately 65%. If it reaches the second resistance at $0.000007288, investors could see gains exceeding 127%. The nearest support lies at $0.000001309, providing a safety net. With the anticipation of an altcoin season and a global crypto bull run, MOG has the potential to surge significantly.

The acquisition, announced on December 10, 2024, further establishes Crypto.com as a comprehensive financial service provider within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Orion Principals Limited is licensed by the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), the region’s prominent financial free zone known for its stringent regulatory framework and emphasis on transparency. This move positions Crypto.com to offer an array of financial services, including securities, options, futures, and contract-for-difference (CFD) trading, catering to a growing demand for diversified investment solutions. Expanding Horizons with Orion Principals Limited Crypto.com’s CEO Kris Marszalek emphasized the strategic value of this acquisition, stating, “The addition of Orion Principals Limited allows us to provide users with a more robust platform for financial investment services.

Securities and CFD trading allow investors to hedge risks and explore sophisticated strategies that were previously unavailable on most crypto platforms. For the industry, this move could signal the start of a new era where crypto exchanges become fully-fledged financial institutions. It also reflects a growing trend of regulatory compliance, which is essential for long-term industry growth and mainstream adoption. A Vision for the Future Marszalek’s vision for Crypto.com extends beyond profitability. The company aims to create an ecosystem where users can seamlessly navigate between traditional and digital assets.

37504942,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=109109,1733922352,"Goldman Sachs CEO Open to Bitcoin and Ethereum Markets, Signals Major Crypto Shift","Goldman Sachs, one of the world’s most prominent investment banks, could soon embrace Bitcoin and Ethereum markets , according to statements from its CEO. In a recent report shared by Tree News on X (formerly Twitter) and citing Reuters, the CEO revealed that the firm is open to exploring these cryptocurrency markets once regulatory approval is secured. This announcement marks a potential milestone for the integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream finance, highlighting the evolving attitude of traditional financial institutions toward digital assets. A Landmark Statement by Goldman Sachs CEO The acknowledgment by Goldman Sachs’ CEO reflects the growing influence and mainstream appeal of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. While the firm has previously dabbled in blockchain technology and crypto-related initiatives, this is the first time its CEO has expressed direct interest in participating in these markets. “If regulatory frameworks align, we are prepared to consider entry into Bitcoin and Ethereum markets,” the CEO was quoted as saying. This cautious but optimistic stance underscores the significance of compliance in navigating the complex world of digital finance. Regulatory Hurdles and Opportunities Participation in cryptocurrency markets requires adherence to evolving global regulatory standards. Governments and regulatory bodies have taken varied approaches to overseeing digital assets, ranging from outright bans to progressive frameworks aimed at fostering innovation. Goldman Sachs’ entry into the Bitcoin and Ethereum markets would likely accelerate regulatory clarity, as the involvement of a major financial institution would prompt governments to establish well-defined guidelines. This development could set a precedent for other institutions looking to venture into cryptocurrencies. Why Bitcoin and Ethereum? Bitcoin and Ethereum are the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization and serve distinct purposes in the digital asset ecosystem. Bitcoin is often referred to as digital gold due to its role as a store of value. Ethereum , on the other hand, is renowned for its smart contract functionality and decentralized applications (dApps), making it a backbone for blockchain innovation. By targeting these two dominant players, Goldman Sachs is strategically positioning itself at the forefront of cryptocurrency adoption. Goldman Sachs and Crypto: A Changing Narrative This isn’t the first time Goldman Sachs has flirted with the idea of cryptocurrencies. The firm has previously launched research on blockchain technology, explored crypto custody services, and even created a dedicated cryptocurrency trading desk. However, the latest statement represents a deeper commitment to potentially trading and investing in Bitcoin and Ethereum. This shift aligns with broader industry trends, where traditional financial institutions are increasingly recognizing the transformative potential of blockchain and digital currencies. Impact on the Financial Industry Goldman Sachs’ openness to Bitcoin and Ethereum markets could pave the way for widespread institutional adoption. Here’s how this move might impact the financial landscape: Increased Legitimacy for Cryptocurrencies : The participation of a leading investment bank would further validate digital assets as a legitimate asset class. Enhanced Market Liquidity : Institutional involvement could drive higher trading volumes and stabilize crypto markets, attracting retail and institutional investors alike. Regulatory Momentum : As major firms advocate for clear regulations, governments are likely to respond with frameworks that support innovation while ensuring consumer protection. What Does This Mean for Investors? The potential entry of Goldman Sachs into the crypto market could benefit investors in several ways: Access to Sophisticated Products : Investors might gain access to advanced financial instruments such as Bitcoin futures, ETFs, and structured products tailored for cryptocurrencies. Risk Mitigation : Institutional participation often introduces stricter risk management practices, which can reduce volatility and enhance investor confidence. Mainstream Integration : The adoption of crypto by traditional banks bridges the gap between legacy finance and decentralized technologies, offering seamless access to both worlds. Crypto Industry Reaction The crypto community has largely welcomed the news, viewing Goldman Sachs’ interest as a sign of growing institutional support. Industry leaders have noted that this move could catalyze a new wave of adoption, as other financial giants may follow suit. However, skeptics argue that traditional financial institutions entering the crypto space could undermine the decentralized ethos of cryptocurrencies. Balancing innovation with compliance remains a critical challenge. Conclusion Goldman Sachs’ openness to Bitcoin and Ethereum markets signals a transformative moment for the financial industry. By aligning with regulatory frameworks, the investment bank could lead the way for institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies, further integrating digital assets into mainstream finance. While challenges remain, the potential benefits—from increased market legitimacy to enhanced investor confidence—underscore the importance of this development. As financial institutions and regulators work toward a collaborative future, the fusion of traditional and digital finance seems inevitable.

37509972,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/3-best-crypto-presales-of-2024-which-coin-will-hit-1-first,1733922339,3 Best Crypto Presales of 2024: Which Coin Will Hit $1 First?,"2024 has seen a surge in crypto presales, with coins boasting massive potential and offering early supporters a chance to back highly promising projects.

Each of these presales brings something unique to the table, from scalable blockchain infrastructure to gaming innovation and DeFi solutions. This list of the 3 best crypto presales of 2024 highlights why these projects are capturing attention and how early participants can strategically position themselves for potential long-term gains. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Leading the Largest Crypto Presale in 2024 BlockDAG (BDAG) has swiftly taken center stage as the best crypto presale of 2024, drawing unparalleled attention from crypto enthusiasts eager to capitalize on its rapid growth. With over $160 million raised toward its $600 million goal, the presale continues to break records.

37504940,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=109112,1733922279,Microsoft Shareholders Reject Bitcoin Investment Proposal Amid Volatility Concerns,"Microsoft shareholders have voted against a proposal to allocate 1% of the company’s assets to Bitcoin, citing concerns about the cryptocurrency’s volatility and prioritizing more stable investment strategies. According to a report by CoinDesk, the board of directors also opposed the move, signaling a cautious stance on incorporating digital assets into Microsoft’s financial strategy. The decision comes as Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, saw its price drop by 4% to $95,700 following the news. The Rejected Proposal: What It Entailed The proposal aimed to allocate a modest 1% of Microsoft’s total assets to Bitcoin. Advocates argued that such an investment could diversify the company’s portfolio and demonstrate forward-thinking leadership in embracing digital currencies. However, shareholder sentiment leaned heavily against the proposal. Concerns about Bitcoin’s price volatility, regulatory uncertainties, and potential risks to the company’s financial stability outweighed the potential benefits. The Microsoft board echoed these concerns, stating that the company’s current investment strategy prioritizes stable and predictable returns over speculative assets like Bitcoin. Volatility: A Key Concern for Shareholders Bitcoin’s notorious price fluctuations have made it a polarizing asset among investors. While its potential for high returns attracts some, its dramatic swings raise red flags for others, particularly in institutional and corporate settings. For instance, Bitcoin’s value has experienced significant highs and lows over the past year, with prices ranging from under $70,000 to over $100,000. Shareholders argued that exposing Microsoft’s balance sheet to such variability could introduce unnecessary risk. A Conservative Approach to Corporate Investments Microsoft’s rejection of the Bitcoin investment proposal reflects a broader trend among major corporations to approach cryptocurrencies cautiously. While some tech giants like Tesla and Square have invested heavily in Bitcoin, others prefer to focus on traditional assets. This decision underscores Microsoft’s commitment to maintaining a conservative investment strategy, prioritizing shareholder value and financial stability over potentially volatile ventures. Bitcoin Market Reaction The news of Microsoft’s decision had an immediate impact on the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin’s price fell by 4%, settling at $95,700 shortly after the announcement. Market analysts attributed the decline to dampened investor sentiment, as Microsoft’s rejection signaled a potential slowdown in corporate adoption of Bitcoin. Despite the dip, some crypto enthusiasts remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term prospects, viewing the decline as a short-term reaction. What This Means for Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Microsoft’s rejection of the Bitcoin investment proposal raises important questions about the future of corporate adoption of cryptocurrencies. Regulatory Landscape : Regulatory uncertainties remain a significant barrier to widespread adoption. Companies are hesitant to invest heavily in Bitcoin without clear guidelines from global regulators. Risk Management : Firms with conservative investment policies may continue to avoid volatile assets, focusing instead on stable investments. Market Influence : Decisions by influential companies like Microsoft can shape market sentiment, influencing how other corporations approach digital assets. Contrasting Views Among Corporations Microsoft’s cautious stance contrasts sharply with companies like Tesla, which has embraced Bitcoin both as an investment and a payment method. Tesla’s decision to invest billions in Bitcoin earlier this year sparked widespread interest and debate about the role of cryptocurrencies in corporate finance. However, Tesla has also faced challenges, including criticism for Bitcoin’s environmental impact and its own financial losses due to price fluctuations. These experiences may serve as cautionary tales for companies like Microsoft that prioritize stability over speculative gains. The Broader Implications for Bitcoin While the rejection may seem like a setback for Bitcoin’s mainstream adoption, it also highlights the cryptocurrency’s challenges in gaining acceptance as a reliable asset class. Volatility : Bitcoin’s price swings continue to deter risk-averse investors, especially in corporate settings. Trust and Stability : For Bitcoin to become a widely accepted corporate asset, it must demonstrate greater price stability and resilience. Regulatory Certainty : Clearer regulations could address corporate concerns, encouraging more companies to explore Bitcoin investments. Conclusion The decision by Microsoft shareholders to reject the Bitcoin investment proposal reflects a cautious approach to cryptocurrency adoption. By prioritizing stability and predictable returns, the tech giant reaffirms its commitment to conservative financial strategies. While this may slow Bitcoin’s path to mainstream corporate adoption, it underscores the need for greater price stability and regulatory clarity in the cryptocurrency market. For now, Bitcoin enthusiasts and corporate leaders alike will continue to watch how companies navigate the evolving digital asset landscape.

JasmyCoin: Restoring Data Sovereignty in the Internet of Things JasmyCoin (JASMY) is a cryptocurrency project by Jasmy Corporation, a Tokyo-based Internet of Things (IoT) provider. The platform combines IoT and blockchain technology to restore and protect individual data sovereignty. It connects service providers and data users, giving users full control over their personal information. Jasmy enables a secure environment where data can be exchanged between IoT devices and decentralized protocols without trust concerns. By decentralizing data storage using edge computing and IPFS, Jasmy promotes data democratization. The coin's potential lies in addressing the growing need for secure data management in the expanding IoT landscape. Its attractiveness in the current market depends on the increasing demand for solutions that empower users over their data. Uniswap's UNI Token: Empowering Users in Decentralized Finance Uniswap's UNI token, launched in September 2020, allows holders to vote on platform developments like fee structures and token distribution. In response to competition from SushiSwap, Uniswap distributed 150 million UNI tokens to past users, with each receiving 400 UNI tokens worth over $1,000 at launch. Uniswap, a leading decentralized exchange on the Ethereum blockchain since 2018, offers an automated liquidity protocol that enables trading without an order book and gives users full control of their funds. Its open-source nature and free token listings set it apart from centralized exchanges by prioritizing accessibility and security. As the fourth-largest DeFi platform with over $3 billion in assets, UNI holds significant potential in the current market cycle. Shiba Inu (SHIB): An Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Growing Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency inspired by Dogecoin but built on the Ethereum blockchain. Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous creator named Ryoshi, it began with a quadrillion tokens. Half of these were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who donated a significant portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply. SHIB's integration with Ethereum allows for applications like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange. Plans are underway for a future NFT platform and a governance system based on a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Given its expanding utility and projects in development, SHIB remains a topic of interest in the current market. Conclusion While coins like JASMY, UNI, and SHIB have less short-term potential, Catzilla emerges as the ultimate meme coin hero offering financial freedom. With a 700% ROI potential during its presale, starting at $0.0002 and rising to $0.0016 over 14 stages, its triple utility—governance features, loyalty rewards, and staking options—unites crypto enthusiasts to dismantle toxic systems and achieve new heights.

This revelation has stirred discussions across financial markets, with crypto enthusiasts and skeptics alike speculating on how Trump’s potential policies could impact the cryptocurrency landscape. Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, has been a focal point of global economic debates in recent years. Trump’s comments signal a possible shift in the U.S. government’s approach to regulating and influencing digital assets during his administration. A Surprising Focus for Trump’s Agenda The announcement marks a departure from Trump’s earlier stance on cryptocurrencies. During his previous term as President, Trump was vocal about his skepticism toward Bitcoin, once referring to it as a “scam” in a 2019 tweet. However, his recent remarks suggest a more nuanced view, indicating that Bitcoin’s growing prominence may require government attention. While Trump has not outlined specific policies yet, his statement underscores the increasing relevance of cryptocurrencies in global financial systems and their potential implications for U.S. economic strategy. Bitcoin Price: A Matter of National Interest? Bitcoin has evolved from a niche technology to a trillion-dollar market that influences global economies. As such, its price movements are closely watched by investors, corporations, and governments worldwide. Trump’s decision to address the Bitcoin price after his inauguration could stem from several factors: Market Volatility : Bitcoin’s price fluctuations can impact investor sentiment and market stability. Regulatory Challenges : The absence of clear cryptocurrency regulations has raised concerns about fraud, money laundering, and market manipulation. Global Competition : As countries like China advance their digital currency initiatives, the U.S. may feel pressure to define its stance on cryptocurrencies to remain competitive. Potential Implications for the Cryptocurrency Market Trump’s focus on Bitcoin price has sparked speculation about potential government actions that could influence the market. Here are some possible scenarios: 1. Regulatory Clarity The lack of consistent regulations has been a significant hurdle for the cryptocurrency industry in the U.S. Trump’s administration could prioritize creating a clear legal framework for digital assets, offering guidance for investors and businesses. Such a move could reduce uncertainty, attract institutional investors, and bolster the legitimacy of cryptocurrencies. 2. Taxation Policies The administration might introduce specific tax policies for cryptocurrency transactions and investments. While this could increase government revenue, it may also discourage some investors due to added financial burdens. 3. Increased Oversight Trump’s administration could push for greater oversight of crypto exchanges to combat illegal activities such as money laundering and fraud. While this would enhance market transparency, it could also impose additional compliance costs on industry players. 4. Institutional Involvement If Trump takes a favorable approach to Bitcoin, it could pave the way for increased institutional adoption. Policies supporting innovation in blockchain technology and digital finance could encourage more corporations to integrate cryptocurrencies into their operations. The Role of Bitcoin in U.S. Economic Strategy Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and limited supply make it a unique financial asset. While some view it as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, others see it as a speculative investment. For the U.S. government, Bitcoin represents both opportunities and challenges: Economic Independence : Bitcoin could offer an alternative to traditional financial systems, reducing reliance on centralized banking. Technological Leadership : By fostering a favorable environment for cryptocurrency innovation, the U.S. could solidify its position as a leader in digital finance. Risks of Unregulated Markets : Without proper oversight, the rapid growth of Bitcoin could pose risks to economic stability. Market Reaction to Trump’s Statement Trump’s announcement has already sparked reactions in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin’s price remained steady at around $95,700 after the news, as investors awaited further details on his plans. Crypto advocates view Trump’s focus on Bitcoin as a positive sign, hoping it will lead to policies that support industry growth. However, skeptics caution that increased government involvement could result in restrictive regulations that stifle innovation. A Turning Point for U.S. Crypto Policy? Trump’s remarks highlight the growing significance of cryptocurrencies in global finance. If his administration follows through on its focus on Bitcoin price, it could mark a turning point for U.S. crypto policy. During his previous term, Trump’s administration maintained a relatively hands-off approach to cryptocurrencies, leaving much of the regulatory groundwork to agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). In contrast, Trump’s renewed focus on Bitcoin suggests a more proactive stance, which could shape the future of the cryptocurrency industry in the U.S. The Global Perspective Trump’s attention to Bitcoin comes at a time when other nations are making significant strides in digital finance: China : The country has launched its digital yuan and continues to develop its blockchain infrastructure, aiming to dominate the global digital currency landscape. European Union : The EU is working on comprehensive cryptocurrency regulations under its Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. El Salvador : The country has adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, showcasing the potential of cryptocurrencies for national economies. For the U.S., maintaining its competitive edge in the face of these developments will require thoughtful policies that balance innovation with risk management. Conclusion The announcement that Trump will focus on Bitcoin price after his inauguration signals a significant shift in the U.S. government’s approach to cryptocurrencies. Whether this leads to supportive policies or increased regulation remains to be seen, but the decision underscores the growing influence of Bitcoin in global financial markets. As the cryptocurrency industry waits for further clarity, Trump’s actions could shape not only Bitcoin’s future but also the broader digital asset ecosystem.

37509087,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/dogecoin-doge-hits-a-new-high-but-can-it-compete-with-shiba-inu-shib-and-tron-trx,1733922151,Dogecoin (DOGE) Hits a New High—But Can It Compete With Shiba Inu (SHIB) and TRON (TRX),"Dogecoin (DOGE), the original meme coin, has surged to new highs once again, fueled by its vibrant community and Elon Musk’s consistent influence. As DOGE captures the spotlight, questions arise about whether it can sustain its momentum in the face of competition from Shiba Inu (SHIB) and TRON (TRX). While DOGE’s charm has kept it at the forefront, its competitors have carved out unique niches that challenge its dominance. This article explores how DOGE stacks up against SHIB and TRX, shedding light on what the future holds for these three contenders in the crypto space. The Rise of Dogecoin: More Than Just a Meme Dogecoin’s rise from a joke cryptocurrency to a market powerhouse is a story that continues to captivate. Originally created in 2013, DOGE gained a cult-like following, culminating in its meteoric rise in 2021. Its appeal lies in its simplicity and community-driven ethos. Why DOGE Remains Popular: Elon Musk’s Endorsements: Musk’s tweets and public comments frequently spark rallies in DOGE’s price, reinforcing its status as the “people’s cryptocurrency.” Widespread Adoption: DOGE has gained traction as a payment method, with companies like Tesla accepting it for merchandise purchases. Community Support: Dogecoin’s loyal fanbase ensures its consistent presence in the market, regardless of broader trends. Shiba Inu (SHIB): The “Dogecoin Killer” Launched in 2020, Shiba Inu entered the scene as a direct challenger to Dogecoin. Dubbed the “Dogecoin Killer,” SHIB has developed a strong ecosystem and gained attention for its innovative features. What Sets SHIB Apart: ShibaSwap Ecosystem: Shiba Inu’s decentralized exchange, ShibaSwap, allows users to stake SHIB tokens and earn rewards, adding utility beyond simple transactions. NFT Integration: SHIB has embraced the NFT market, launching unique collections that attract a younger, tech-savvy audience. Active Burn Mechanism: The project’s token burn initiatives aim to reduce supply, potentially increasing SHIB’s value over time. Despite these advancements, SHIB remains highly speculative, with its value largely influenced by market sentiment and social media trends. TRON (TRX): The Utility-Driven Contender Unlike DOGE and SHIB, TRON (TRX) focuses on utility and decentralized applications (dApps). Founded by Justin Sun in 2017, TRON’s goal is to create a decentralized internet, making it a stark contrast to the meme-driven narratives of DOGE and SHIB. TRON’s Unique Strengths: Scalable Network: TRON supports high transaction speeds at minimal costs, making it a practical platform for dApp developers. Strong Ecosystem: With applications in gaming, entertainment, and DeFi, TRON has established itself as a versatile blockchain platform. Global Partnerships: TRON has partnered with major companies, including Samsung and BitTorrent, enhancing its credibility and utility. While TRX lacks the meme coin appeal of DOGE and SHIB, its focus on real-world applications gives it a unique edge in the market. Can Dogecoin Compete With Shiba Inu (SHIB) and TRON (TRX)? Now you know how Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and TRON differ in their approach and strengths. But can DOGE compete with SHIB and TRX? It’s difficult to predict the future of these cryptocurrencies, as their values are highly volatile. Here are some potential scenarios: DOGE Outperforms SHIB and TRX: Dogecoin’s widespread adoption and loyal community give it an advantage over its competitors, allowing it to maintain its position as a top cryptocurrency. SHIB Surpasses DOGE: If SHIB continues to expand its ecosystem and gain mainstream attention, it could potentially surpass DOGE in market value. TRX Becomes the Ultimate Utility Coin: TRON’s focus on practical applications could lead to widespread adoption and solidify its position as a leading utility coin, outcompeting DOGE and SHIB. Market Consolidation: With the constant introduction of new cryptocurrencies, it’s possible that DOGE, SHIB, and TRX could all lose value as investors turn to newer options. No matter what happens, one thing is for sure: the battle between these three coins will continue to capture the attention of crypto enthusiasts Can Dogecoin Sustain Its Highs? Dogecoin’s current rally demonstrates its enduring popularity, but its future depends on several factors: Utility Expansion:While DOGE is widely accepted for payments, its lack of additional use cases may limit its long-term growth. Community Engagement:The Dogecoin community remains one of its strongest assets. Continued engagement will be crucial in sustaining its relevance. Market Sentiment:Like other meme coins, DOGE’s value is heavily influenced by social media trends and celebrity endorsements. Lightchain AI (LCAI): A Rising Star in Blockchain As DOGE, SHIB, and TRX compete for dominance, Lightchain AI (LCAI) is quietly emerging as a game-changing platform. By integrating artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, Lightchain AI addresses the limitations of traditional cryptocurrencies.

37504850,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=109118,1733922146,"Bitwise Predicts Record-High Prices for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana in 2025","Bitwise Asset Management, a leading cryptocurrency investment firm, has unveiled an ambitious forecast for 2025, predicting new highs for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) . Following a stellar 2024 performance, these top cryptocurrencies are expected to continue their upward trajectory, driven by strong institutional interest and significant network developments. Bitwise’s bullish outlook anticipates: Bitcoin (BTC) reaching $200,000. Ethereum (ETH) peaking at $7,000. Solana (SOL) soaring to $750. Each prediction highlights the increasing relevance of cryptocurrencies in global financial systems, with Bitwise attributing the anticipated growth to expanding adoption, innovative network activity, and favorable market dynamics. 2024: A Year of Outperformance for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana Before diving into the specifics of the 2025 forecast, it’s essential to examine the groundwork laid in 2024. The year saw Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana outperform traditional asset classes , securing their positions as dominant forces in the financial world. Bitcoin (BTC) : Surged by 141.72% , buoyed by the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and increasing corporate interest. Ethereum (ETH) : Gained 75.77% , with growth driven by layer-2 adoption, DeFi innovation, and stablecoin projects. Solana (SOL) : Posted an impressive 127.71% increase, cementing its reputation as a go-to blockchain for high-speed applications. This outperformance is a testament to the resilience of cryptocurrencies and their ability to adapt and thrive in a rapidly evolving financial landscape. Bitcoin (BTC): Targeting $200,000 in 2025 Bitwise predicts that Bitcoin will reach $200,000 in 2025, driven by several key factors that are poised to accelerate its adoption and value. 1. Institutional Adoption via ETFs One of the primary drivers of Bitcoin’s growth is the increasing flow of funds from institutional investors, facilitated by the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). These ETFs provide a regulated and easily accessible avenue for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin. In 2024, the introduction of ETFs sparked a surge in demand, and this trend is expected to continue into 2025, bringing in billions of dollars in new investments. 2. Corporate and Government Adoption More corporations and even governments are beginning to recognize Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value and an inflation hedge. This trend is particularly evident in emerging markets, where Bitcoin is increasingly being used as a tool for economic empowerment. 3. Scarcity Effect of the Bitcoin Halving The next Bitcoin halving event, set for April 2024, will reduce the block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. This reduction in new supply, combined with growing demand, is expected to create a scarcity effect, pushing Bitcoin’s price to new heights. Bitwise’s forecast reflects Bitcoin’s growing appeal as a “digital gold” that offers financial independence and protection against traditional market volatility. Ethereum (ETH): Poised to Hit $7,000 Ethereum, the world’s leading smart contract platform, is projected to reach $7,000 in 2025. This growth will be underpinned by Ethereum’s role as the backbone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and its ability to adapt to user demands. 1. Expansion of Layer-2 Networks Ethereum’s scalability challenges have been addressed through layer-2 solutions like Optimism, Arbitrum, and zkSync. These networks significantly reduce transaction costs and congestion, enabling Ethereum to support a wider range of decentralized applications (dApps). 2. Growth in Stablecoin Activity Ethereum remains the preferred blockchain for stablecoins such as USDC and DAI, which are critical for global trade, cross-border payments, and digital commerce. The increasing adoption of stablecoins will continue to drive demand for Ethereum’s network. 3. Spot ETF Approval Following Bitcoin, Ethereum is also expected to benefit from the approval of spot ETFs. These funds will open the doors for institutional investors to participate in Ethereum’s ecosystem, providing a significant boost to its price. Bitwise highlights Ethereum’s versatility and its ability to remain at the forefront of blockchain innovation as key reasons for its projected growth. Solana (SOL): Targeting $750 with Ecosystem Expansion Solana, known for its high-speed transactions and low costs, is expected to achieve a price of $750 by the end of 2025. Bitwise’s forecast underscores Solana’s rapid ecosystem growth and its increasing appeal to developers and users. 1. Migration of High-Quality Projects In recent years, Solana has attracted a growing number of “serious” projects, including those focused on DeFi, NFTs, and gaming. These migrations highlight the network’s scalability, efficiency, and ability to support complex applications. 2. Dominance in Memecoins and NFTs Solana has carved out a niche as a leading blockchain for memecoins and NFT projects. Its vibrant community and developer-friendly infrastructure make it a top choice for creators and entrepreneurs. 3. Institutional Recognition Bitwise notes that Solana’s increasing institutional recognition is a testament to its credibility as a top-tier blockchain network. This support will likely attract more investment, further fueling its growth. Broader Market Trends Supporting Growth Bitwise’s predictions for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana are not isolated but are part of broader market trends that signal a maturing cryptocurrency industry. 1. Increasing Institutional Participation The entry of traditional financial institutions into the cryptocurrency market is a game-changer. From ETFs to custody solutions, institutional adoption is driving liquidity, stability, and legitimacy. 2. Regulatory Developments Clearer regulations in key markets like the U.S., Europe, and Asia are fostering an environment where cryptocurrencies can thrive. These developments reduce uncertainty and encourage broader adoption. 3. Advancements in Blockchain Technology Continuous innovation in blockchain technology, including improvements in scalability, security, and interoperability, is enabling cryptocurrencies to support a growing number of real-world use cases. Challenges and Risks While Bitwise’s outlook is optimistic, it is important to consider the potential challenges that could impact these projections: Regulatory Uncertainty : Governments may introduce restrictive policies that could dampen growth. Market Volatility : The cryptocurrency market remains susceptible to sudden price swings. Competition : Emerging blockchain platforms could pose a threat to established players like Ethereum and Solana. Conclusion Bitwise’s forecast for new highs for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana in 2025 reflects the continued growth and maturation of the cryptocurrency market. With Bitcoin targeting $200,000, Ethereum aiming for $7,000, and Solana projected to reach $750, the next year holds significant promise for investors. These predictions underscore the transformative potential of cryptocurrencies as they evolve from speculative assets to integral components of the global financial system.

Hong Kong’s Fast-Track Crypto Licensing Plan Joseph Chan, Acting Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury disclosed at a parliamentary session that the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) is working to implement a “swift licensing process.” JUST IN: Hong Kong commits to accelerating the licensing process for crypto trading platforms, solidifying its push to be a global #crypto hub! — Breaking Whale (@BreakingWhale) December 11, 2024 A consultative panel is expected to be operational early next year to support licensed platforms. The crypto licensing regime, which began in June 2023, allows licensed trading platforms to offer services to retail investors. Currently, firms like OSL Exchange, HashKey Exchange, and HKVAX have obtained licenses under this framework. Beyond crypto licensing, Hong Kong is also preparing legislation to regulate stablecoin activities. Joseph Chan mentioned that the government intends to present a bill focused on stablecoin issuers to the Legislative Council this month. The proposal mandates fiat-referenced stablecoin issuers to obtain licenses from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). This aligns with global regulatory trends for increasing oversight of stablecoins. Expanding Regulations for Stablecoins and Custody Services Additionally, authorities are set to tackle crypto regulation in custody services. By 2024, the SFC plans to introduce a proposal to license firms offering cryptocurrency storage solutions. This initiative addresses security concerns and ensures investor protection as the sector evolves. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) recently warned crypto firms against misusing the term “bank” in their marketing or operations, stressing that only licensed institutions can use such terminology. Hong Kong’s proactive stance is a response to intensifying competition in the global cryptocurrency landscape. Regions like Singapore and the UAE have also implemented crypto-friendly regulations, pushing Hong Kong to enhance its appeal.

Hong Kong is also taking steps to boost its crypto ecosystem by offering tax exemptions for hedge funds, private equity firms, and ultra-wealthy investors on profits from cryptocurrencies. This initiative, alongside similar tax breaks for private credit and carbon credits, aims to attract more asset managers to the region. The government has launched a six-week consultation to refine the proposal, further strengthening its position as a global financial hub.

37504849,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=109121,1733922081,Italy to Reduce Proposed Crypto Tax Hike Amid Industry Pushback,"In response to mounting opposition from the cryptocurrency industry and internal government disagreements, Italy plans to scale back its proposed crypto capital gains tax hike . Initially set to increase to 42%, lawmakers are now considering capping the rate at 28% or maintaining the current 26%. The revised tax plan, which is part of the 2025 budget, must be finalized and approved by December. The proposal has been a contentious topic in Italy’s economic policy discussions, reflecting broader debates on how governments should tax digital assets while fostering innovation and protecting small investors. Original Proposal: A Steep 42% Tax Hike The original proposal aimed to impose a 42% tax on crypto capital gains , aligning the taxation of cryptocurrencies with Italy’s top marginal income tax rate. Proponents of the hike argued it would generate significant revenue for the government amid growing adoption of digital currencies. However, this plan faced immediate backlash from industry stakeholders, investors, and political opponents, who criticized it as excessive and potentially harmful to Italy’s burgeoning crypto sector. Critics argued that such a steep tax could: Drive crypto investors to relocate to more tax-friendly jurisdictions. Discourage innovation and stifle the growth of blockchain-related businesses in Italy. Burden small investors, who may not have the resources to absorb such high tax rates. Industry Pushback and Government Response The cryptocurrency industry, both within Italy and globally, voiced strong opposition to the 42% tax proposal. Industry leaders warned that the policy could undermine Italy’s position as a potential hub for blockchain innovation. Amid this criticism, Economy Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti and other government officials signaled a willingness to reconsider the tax rate. Giorgetti has been open to alternative approaches, emphasizing the need for a balanced solution that supports revenue generation without discouraging investment. Revised Proposal: A More Moderate Approach Lawmakers are now weighing two potential revisions: Capping the tax rate at 28% This rate aligns with Italy’s mid-tier income tax bracket, making it more competitive with other European nations. Maintaining the current 26% rate with progressive taxation A progressive system would protect small investors by imposing lower rates on smaller gains and higher rates on larger profits. The revised approach aims to address concerns from both industry stakeholders and members of the governing coalition, who have struggled to reach a consensus on the matter. Progressive Taxation to Protect Small Investors One of the most discussed alternatives is the introduction of a progressive tax system for crypto capital gains. Under this model: Small investors with minimal gains would face lower tax rates, reducing their financial burden. High-net-worth individuals and institutions with substantial profits would pay higher rates, ensuring fair taxation. This system could strike a balance between revenue generation and investor protection, aligning with Italy’s broader economic goals while fostering a supportive environment for crypto adoption. The Role of the 2025 Budget The revised crypto tax proposal is part of Italy’s 2025 budget plan, which includes various measures to address the nation’s economic challenges. The budget must be approved by lawmakers before the December deadline, leaving little time for prolonged debates. The proposal has become a focal point in Italy’s coalition government, with disagreements over tax policy reflecting broader divisions within the ruling parties. Economy Minister Giorgetti has played a key role in mediating these disputes and seeking a compromise that satisfies all stakeholders. Why Crypto Taxation Matters in Italy Italy’s approach to crypto taxation is closely watched by industry players and other governments, as it reflects broader global trends in regulating and taxing digital assets. 1. Rising Adoption of Cryptocurrencies Italy, like many nations, has seen a surge in cryptocurrency adoption. From retail investors to businesses exploring blockchain technology, digital assets are becoming increasingly integrated into the economy. 2. Revenue Generation Taxing crypto capital gains represents a significant opportunity for governments to generate revenue. However, striking the right balance is crucial to avoid driving investors to other jurisdictions. 3. Regulatory Clarity Clear and fair tax policies are essential for fostering investor confidence and supporting the growth of the cryptocurrency market. Ambiguity or overly burdensome regulations can hinder progress and innovation. The European Context Italy’s crypto tax debate is part of a broader conversation happening across Europe, as nations grapple with how to regulate and tax digital assets. France and Germany : Have implemented moderate tax rates on crypto gains, balancing revenue needs with industry growth. Portugal : Known for its crypto-friendly policies, attracting investors with a near-zero tax rate on digital assets. United Kingdom : Recently introduced stricter regulations on crypto, but with tax policies that remain relatively competitive. Italy’s decision will likely influence other European countries, particularly those seeking to attract crypto businesses and investors. Industry Reaction to the Revised Proposal The proposed reduction of the crypto tax hike has been met with cautious optimism from industry stakeholders. Investors : Welcome the possibility of a lower tax rate or a progressive system, which would reduce financial burdens and encourage continued participation in the market. Businesses : See the revised proposal as a positive step toward creating a supportive environment for blockchain innovation and entrepreneurship. However, some remain skeptical, noting that even a 28% tax rate could still be considered high compared to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions. Challenges Ahead While the revised proposal is a step in the right direction, challenges remain: Coalition Disagreements : Internal divisions within the government could delay the approval process, creating uncertainty for investors and businesses. Global Competition : Italy must compete with other nations offering more favorable tax environments, such as Portugal and Malta. Implementation and Enforcement : Ensuring compliance with crypto tax laws can be challenging due to the decentralized and pseudonymous nature of digital assets. Conclusion Italy’s decision to reduce the proposed crypto tax hike from 42% to a more moderate rate reflects the government’s efforts to balance revenue generation with the need to foster innovation and protect small investors. Whether the tax rate is capped at 28% or the current 26% rate is maintained with a progressive system, the outcome will have significant implications for Italy’s crypto industry and its broader economic strategy. As the December deadline for the 2025 budget approaches, the revised proposal signals a more measured approach to cryptocurrency taxation. By addressing industry concerns and promoting a fairer system, Italy has the opportunity to position itself as a competitive player in the global digital asset market.

Fantom (FTM) Eyes Significant Growth Amid Upcoming Altcoin Season Fantom's price currently ranges between $1.08 and $1.49, showing consolidation after a strong monthly gain of 50.40%. The recent pullback of 8.75% over the past week might be a brief correction before the next upward move. With the nearest resistance level at $1.65, breaking this could see Fantom rising towards the next resistance at $2.06. This would represent a potential increase of around 40% from current prices. The RSI at 47.70 suggests the coin is neutral, leaving room for growth. The upcoming altcoin season and a global crypto bull run could propel Fantom to new highs, especially if it maintains its upward trend over the past six months, which has seen a 68.37% increase. Immutable (IMX) Poised for Breakout Amid Bullish Crypto Momentum Immutable (IMX) is trading between $1.88 and $2.26, showing potential for an upward move. With the nearest resistance at $2.45, breaking this level could lead to significant gains. The coin has risen over 30% in the past month, indicating strong momentum. The RSI at 45 suggests there's room for growth before hitting overbought territory. If IMX surpasses the first resistance, it might target the second resistance at $2.83, offering potential gains of around 25%. The approaching altcoin season could fuel this rise, making IMX a coin to watch in the coming weeks. Ondo (ONDO) Sets Sights on Breaking $2.40 Resistance Level Ondo's price has moved between $1.24 and $2.04 recently, gaining 110.27% over the past month. This strong upward momentum brings it close to the resistance level at $2.40. Breaking this barrier could propel the price toward the next resistance at $3.21. The Relative Strength Index is at 53.60, indicating neutral to slightly bullish sentiment. The 10-day Simple Moving Average of $1.57 is approaching the 100-day SMA of $1.64, suggesting potential short-term gains. Although the MACD is slightly negative at -0.0044, the overall trend appears positive. Ondo could see significant growth if it surpasses these key levels, potentially increasing by over 50% from its current position. Ethena Gains Momentum: Could ENA Break Through Key Resistance Levels? Ethena (ENA) is gaining momentum with a 68% surge over the past month. Trading between $0.81 and $1.20, the coin shows potential for further growth. The next resistance level at $1.37 could be within reach, representing a possible gain of over 14% from the current high. The 10-day Simple Moving Average of $0.93 is nearing the 100-day SMA of $1.01, hinting at a bullish crossover. With an RSI of 44.09, there's room for upward movement before entering overbought territory. If the bullish trend continues, ENA could target the second resistance level at $1.76, offering substantial gains. Conclusion While FTM, IMX, ONDO, and ENA may show less potential in the short term, Catzilla emerges as a meme coin focused on financial freedom for all. Offering governance participation, loyalty rewards, and staking options, it aims to unite enthusiasts seeking both enjoyment and profit. Catzilla invites participation in its community-driven project to challenge obstacles in the crypto space.

Bitcoin: The Original Cryptocurrency and Its Ongoing Potential Bitcoin (BTC) is the first cryptocurrency, introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto to enable decentralized peer-to-peer transactions without the need for banks. It operates on blockchain technology, where transactions are verified by a network of nodes through a process called mining. Miners solve complex puzzles to validate transactions and are rewarded with bitcoins. The supply of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million coins, and approximately every four years, a “halving” event reduces miners’ rewards by half. This scarcity can influence its value. With its pioneering technology and limited supply, Bitcoin continues to have significant potential. In the current market cycle, it may look attractive to those interested in alternative investments and decentralized finance. Conclusion In the current bull run, while established coins like BTC have less short-term potential, DOGEN stands out. Designed for those seeking the best, it embodies luxury and success. Expected to grow 700% by presale’s end, with potential for thousand-fold returns, DOGEN builds a community of leaders and offers real benefits to early adopters.

37504802,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=109123,1733922017,Ripple Secures NYDFS Approval for RLUSD Stablecoin: A Game-Changer for Regulated Crypto,"Ripple Labs, the powerhouse behind XRP and a leader in blockchain innovation, has achieved a monumental milestone by securing final approval for its RLUSD stablecoin from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) . Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced the news on X (formerly Twitter), stating that this achievement marks a new chapter in the company’s pursuit of compliant and innovative financial solutions. The approval is a testament to Ripple’s commitment to aligning blockchain technology with regulatory frameworks, further cementing its reputation as a leader in the cryptocurrency industry. Exchange listings and partner integrations are expected to follow soon, as Ripple gears up for the next phase of RLUSD’s rollout. Understanding RLUSD: Ripple’s Stablecoin Initiative The RLUSD stablecoin represents Ripple’s entry into the stablecoin market, designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the U.S. dollar. This means RLUSD offers stability, making it a low-volatility option for payments, remittances, and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Stablecoins like RLUSD have become integral to the cryptocurrency ecosystem, serving as a bridge between traditional fiat currencies and blockchain-based transactions. Ripple’s focus on compliance and innovation places RLUSD in a unique position to drive adoption among institutions and retail users alike. Core Features of RLUSD Stability : RLUSD’s peg to the U.S. dollar ensures minimal price volatility, making it ideal for day-to-day transactions and global remittances. Regulatory Compliance : NYDFS approval ensures RLUSD adheres to strict legal and operational standards. Integration with RippleNet : RLUSD will operate seamlessly within Ripple’s payment ecosystem, enabling fast, cost-effective cross-border transactions. NYDFS Approval: A High Regulatory Standard The NYDFS is one of the most respected and stringent financial regulators in the world. Receiving its approval is a significant achievement for Ripple, as it demonstrates the company’s commitment to meeting rigorous standards in compliance, security, and operational integrity. Why NYDFS Approval Matters Legitimacy : The approval assures institutions, exchanges, and users that RLUSD meets stringent regulatory requirements. Market Access : Many financial institutions and exchanges require assets to meet NYDFS standards before they can be integrated. Trust and Transparency : Approval from a reputable regulatory body builds confidence among users and partners. Ripple’s Vision for RLUSD Ripple has always sought to bridge the gap between traditional finance and blockchain technology. RLUSD plays a crucial role in this mission by providing a stable, compliant, and efficient digital asset that aligns with global financial systems. 1. RLUSD as a Payment Solution Ripple envisions RLUSD becoming a key tool for global payments and remittances. Its stability and integration with RippleNet make it an attractive option for institutions looking to optimize cross-border transactions. 2. RLUSD in DeFi The stablecoin is also expected to play a significant role in the DeFi ecosystem, where stability and liquidity are essential. RLUSD could be used for lending, borrowing, and yield farming, providing users with new opportunities to engage with decentralized financial services. 3. Institutional Adoption Ripple’s focus on compliance makes RLUSD a viable option for institutional investors and partners. Banks, payment providers, and fintech companies can leverage RLUSD to enhance their services while adhering to regulatory standards. Exchange Listings and Partner Rollouts With NYDFS approval secured, Ripple is now focusing on integrating RLUSD into cryptocurrency exchanges and partnerships. CEO Brad Garlinghouse has promised updates as listings and collaborations take shape, signaling that RLUSD’s ecosystem will expand rapidly in the coming months. Potential Partners and Markets Ripple’s extensive network of partners—including financial institutions, payment processors, and blockchain companies—positions RLUSD for widespread adoption. From remittance companies leveraging RippleNet to DeFi protocols seeking stable liquidity, RLUSD’s use cases are vast. The Growing Role of Stablecoins in Crypto The introduction of RLUSD comes at a time when stablecoins are increasingly becoming a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency market. These digital assets provide a bridge between the volatility of cryptocurrencies and the stability of fiat currencies, offering practical solutions for both institutional and retail use. How Stablecoins Are Transforming Finance Cross-Border Payments Stablecoins like RLUSD make cross-border transactions faster and cheaper than traditional banking systems. Ripple’s existing infrastructure amplifies these benefits, enabling near-instant global payments. DeFi Integration Stablecoins are integral to DeFi platforms, where they serve as a reliable medium for trading, lending, and borrowing. RLUSD’s compliance and stability position it as a trusted option for DeFi users. Economic Inclusion In regions with unstable fiat currencies, stablecoins offer a secure store of value and an efficient means of exchange. RLUSD’s approval could pave the way for broader financial inclusion. Ripple’s Leadership in Regulated Crypto Ripple’s success with RLUSD is the latest example of its proactive approach to navigating the regulatory landscape. The company has consistently emphasized compliance and transparency, making it a trusted partner for institutions exploring blockchain technology. 1. Building Trust Through Regulation By securing NYDFS approval, Ripple sets a precedent for other cryptocurrency projects. The approval demonstrates that it is possible to innovate within the constraints of regulatory frameworks, fostering trust among users and regulators. 2. Advancing Blockchain Adoption Ripple’s efforts to align with regulatory standards have not only strengthened its own position but have also advanced the broader adoption of blockchain technology. RLUSD is poised to play a key role in this journey, offering a compliant digital asset that meets the needs of modern finance. Challenges and Competition While Ripple’s achievement is noteworthy, the RLUSD stablecoin will face several challenges as it enters the market. 1. Market Competition The stablecoin market is already dominated by established players like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC). RLUSD will need to carve out a niche to compete effectively. 2. Regulatory Landscape As global regulations around cryptocurrencies continue to evolve, Ripple will need to stay ahead of compliance requirements to maintain RLUSD’s credibility. 3. Adoption Barriers Building adoption for RLUSD will require strong partnerships, robust education campaigns, and seamless user experiences. Ripple’s established network will be crucial in overcoming these barriers. Implications for the Crypto Industry Ripple’s approval for RLUSD has far-reaching implications for the cryptocurrency market: Setting a Regulatory Benchmark RLUSD’s approval by NYDFS sets a high standard for other stablecoins, encouraging greater compliance across the industry. Institutional Adoption The launch of a regulated stablecoin like RLUSD could accelerate institutional interest in blockchain-based solutions, driving mainstream adoption of digital assets. Global Financial Innovation Ripple’s success highlights the potential of blockchain to revolutionize traditional finance, offering faster, cheaper, and more inclusive solutions. Conclusion The NYDFS approval of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin is a landmark moment for the company and the broader cryptocurrency industry. By aligning with rigorous regulatory standards, Ripple has positioned RLUSD as a trusted and versatile digital asset for payments, DeFi, and institutional use. As Ripple prepares for exchange listings and partner rollouts, RLUSD is poised to become a pivotal tool in bridging the gap between traditional finance and blockchain innovation. This milestone reinforces Ripple’s leadership in the regulated crypto space and sets the stage for broader adoption of compliant digital assets.

37504778,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4743503-terawulf-sound-strategy-but-high-valuation?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,1733922000,TeraWulf: Sound Strategy But High Valuation,"Summary TeraWulf has made strategic moves, including selling its Nautilus stake and ending a lease early, to focus on HPC/AI data centers. The company is transitioning from Bitcoin mining to high-performance computing, with plans to announce its first HPC client by year-end. Hedge funds, including Stanley Druckenmiller's Duquesne Family Office, have increased their stakes in WULF, indicating institutional interest. Despite potential, WULF remains speculative; I maintain a 'hold' rating until further progression in the HPC business is evident. My last article covering TeraWulf ( WULF ) for Seeking Alpha was in late-August. For the third time out of five instances previously covering the stock, I concluded WULF was a 'hold.' Among other things, part of the focus of that article was Stanley Druckenmiller's Duquesne Family Office opening a stake in WULF. Since then, WULF shares have ripped higher by about 50%: Data by YCharts Not only has WULF appreciated quite spectacularly since late-August, but it has done so while also outperforming larger mining stocks and the CoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF ( WGMI ). Quite a bit has happened over the last 3.5 months. In this update, we'll go over the company's recent strategic moves, production results, recent trends in institutional buying, and take a look at WULF's current valuation. Strategic Moves October was busy for TeraWulf with multiple announcements. First, the company sold its 25% stake in the Nautilus joint venture to Talen Energy in a deal valued at about $92 million. Per the announced agreement , TeraWulf received $85 million in cash and $7 million in mining machines. The company said it will use the proceeds from the Nautilus sale to build out its 20 MW CB-1 facility at Lake Mariner. This is part of a core strategy that is centered around expansion of the business into HPC/AI data centers. On the expansion point, TeraWulf also entered a new 35-year lease agreement with Somerset Operating Company, LLC at Lake Mariner - which effectively ended the original Lake Mariner lease from less than four years ago ten years early. This is an interesting deal for a few reasons. First, TeraWulf CEO Paul Prager owns Somerset. Which could theoretically be seen as a conflict of interest, especially since TeraWulf paid Somerset's parent company 20 million WULF shares and $12 million in cash to terminate the original lease. Per the deal, Somerset's parent can only sell the WULF common shares after lockup periods of 12 months (5 million shares) and 18 months (15 million shares). Given Prager is already a large holder of WULF stock, this new lease agreement could also be viewed as an alignment of Prager's interests. The justification for ending the original lease early has been that the first agreement had an escalation in payments that is no longer in the new agreement. TeraWulf's new lease was reportedly negotiated by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors with consultation from independent legal counsel. The Company's financial advisor deemed the deal to be fair from a financial standpoint. Roughly two weeks after the new lease agreement, TeraWulf's Board authorized a $200 million share repurchase agreement that would be effective through the end of 2025; of which $115 million has already been deployed via the purchase of 18 million shares. Finally, on October 25th TeraWulf announced the closing of a $500 million senior note offering at 2.75% due in 2030. As just mentioned, $115 million of this note offering was already used to repurchase WULF shares. November Investor Deck Slide 13 (TeraWulf) The company referenced slide 13 from the November investor deck a few times during the Q3 call, and it's notable because it shows a $387 million unallocated cash position for 2025. TeraWulf is anticipating $100 million in 2025 cash flow with $347 million in prepay and project financing to grow out HPC/AI compute. Prager said on the Q3 call that TeraWulf is in advanced discussions for the company's first HPC client and expects to make an announcement by the end of the year. This would be a big deal and I think highlights where TeraWulf is ultimately going. Bitcoin Production What seems quite clear at this point in time, at least to me, is TeraWulf is planning for a potential life after Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining. We can see these signals through not just the strategic moves in October, but also through what leadership is overtly saying during conference calls. TeraWulf seems well aware of the mining economics of Bitcoin, and that's why the growth area has been identified as HPC/AI. CFO Patrick Fleury from the Q3 CC: certainly the next 500 megawatts of expansion for us is in high power computing AI. And that will probably coincide with the next halving. So we've got plenty of running room and then time to decide whether we keep mining Bitcoin or not. But we've got plenty of time to play that out. For the time being, mining Bitcoin is potentially a means to end for the company. TeraWulf has one of the most efficient operations judging by BTC mined per average EH/s as of November 2024: November 2024 EH/s BTC BTC per EH/s MARA 46.1 907 19.67 WULF 5.9 115 19.49 HIVE 5.3 103 19.43 IREN 19.7 379 19.24 RIOT 25.8 495 19.19 Source: Company press releases, analyst's calculations Readers should recall that TeraWulf has never adopted a ""HODL"" strategy, as the company has generally sold all production during the course of the month. That production has been slipping since the end of Q3: Monthly BTC Mining Production (Author's Chart, TeraWulf Filings) In the month of November, TeraWulf mined 115 BTC at a reported energy cost of $41k BTC. The average operating EH/s in the month was slightly down month over month, from 6.8 EH/s in October to 5.9 EH/s in November. During the month, TeraWulf had a planned outage while upgrading machines and connecting high-voltage redundant power feeds. In the November investor deck, TeraWulf guided for 465 BTC to be mined in Q4-24. Given just 265 BTC mined between October and November, I question whether the company can get there: Data by YCharts With the recent surge in the price of Bitcoin over the last couple of months, global network hash rate has exploded to about 800 EH/s. The growth in network hash has produced yet another all-time low in BTC per PH/s per day - which currently stands at slightly above 62,000 sats. The good news for miners is the dollar-denominated hash price is near a 3-month high at $60: Hashrate Index It should be fairly obvious at this point why TeraWulf is positioning for a future that is more reliant on high performance compute rather than mining Bitcoin. The latter of which is a very challenging business and one that lacks stability in revenues. Hedge Fund Positioning & Valuation In August, I noted that Stanley Druckenmiller's Duquesne Family Office had taken a stake in WULF stock and cautioned against fading the legendary trader. Since then, we've seen Duquesne increase its stake in WULF from 2.1 million shares to 2.9 million in just a single quarter. It's important to remember that these are lagging reports, and we won't know if any of these shares have been sold until well after Q4 is over. But we can also look at hedge fund purchases for WULF against similar trends in other Bitcoin mining stocks: Shares Held By Hedge Funds (millions) Q2-24 Q3-24 QoQ Bitdeer ( BTDR ) 5.62 8.96 59.43% Core Scientific ( CORZ ) 88.59 110.84 25.12% Hut 8 ( HUT ) 28.91 32.64 12.90% Cipher Mining ( CIFR ) 58.26 62.06 6.52% CleanSpark ( CLSK ) 66.45 70.41 5.96% TeraWulf 125.15 130.02 3.89% Bitfarms ( BITF ) 27.74 27.39 -1.26% MARA Holdings ( MARA ) 114.63 113.01 -1.41% Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) 89.12 86.35 -3.11% IREN Limited ( IREN ) 50.47 26.67 -47.16% 10 Stock Average 6.1% Source: HedgeFollow The table above shows the quarter-over-quarter change in hedge fund ownership of top Bitcoin mining stocks based on market capitalization. At 3.9% QoQ growth in shares held by hedge funds, TeraWulf wasn't the biggest beneficiary of investment capital last quarter and actually slightly trailed the 10 stock average of about 6%. However, at 385.9 million shares outstanding at the end of Q3, hedge funds owned 33.7% of all WULF shares. This was well ahead of the 22.4% average of the stocks sampled in the table above. The question that I keep coming back to is what is the right valuation for WULF shares today? HPC/AI compute is clearly the direction the company is going, but there hasn't been any realized revenue from that segment yet and, frankly, there is no guarantee there will be. To me, it still makes the most sense at this point in time to value the business based off what the company is producing from BTC mining. So let's make some assumptions about what WULF can realistically generate based on Bitcoin prices. TeraWulf Market Capitalization $2.6 billion Estimated Monthly Production 250 BTC FWD P/S At $100k BTC 8.7 FWD P/S At $150k BTC 5.8 FWD P/S At $200k BTC 4.4 Source: Analyst's table and calculations TeraWulf's three-month average between September and November was 147 BTC mined, and it did so on average of about 7 EH/s each month. Let's assume the company gets to a realized average hashrate of 13.2 EH/s in Q1 2025 and can continue to mine 19 BTC per EH/s. That would put TeraWulf at about 250 BTC per month. Shareholders are paying nearly 9 times forward BTC sales for WULF at a $100k BTC price. Even if Bitcoin doubles from here, WULF shareholders are still paying a premium over the 3.3x info tech sector median forward price to sales multiple. Closing Summary TeraWulf is a very interesting company, to say the least. While there are certainly some Bitcoin miners-turned HPC companies that are buying GPUs and going with more of the 'compute as a service' business route, that is not what TeraWulf is doing here as the company is focusing more on scaling power infrastructure for the AI hyperscalers. I think TeraWulf's approach is probably going to be the better long-term strategy, but that's purely a guess on my part. All this said, I think a lot of potential has already been priced in to the stock based on the current business model. I could certainly entertain taking a position in WULF again following any further progression in the company's HPC business. But for now, I'm going to reiterate my 'hold' call on WULF. I suspect the stock is still marvelous for trading both Bitcoin and HPC narratives in the zeitgeist. But as a long-term investment, it's still very speculative.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | SPONSORED | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4743503-terawulf-sound-strategy-but-high-valuation?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/37504778.jpeg

37504800,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=109125,1733921955,VanEck Forecasts Continued Bitcoin Growth as Altcoin Index Surges by 53%,"Asset management giant VanEck has released an optimistic report signaling continued growth for Bitcoin (BTC), fueled by a significant surge in the Altcoin Season Index . According to data shared by CryptoSlate, the index jumped 53% over the past 30 days , a bullish indicator for the cryptocurrency market. The Altcoin Season Index measures the performance of the top 50 cryptocurrencies (excluding Bitcoin) against Bitcoin over the last 90 days. Historically, trends in this index suggest that Bitcoin creates a feedback loop with altcoins, where rising altcoin prices further boost Bitcoin’s value, propelling the market toward a potential cycle peak. This report by VanEck offers valuable insights into how Bitcoin and altcoin markets interact, reflecting the growing maturity and interdependence of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. What Is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index serves as a key metric for gauging market trends in the cryptocurrency sector. By analyzing the relative performance of altcoins against Bitcoin over a defined period, the index helps investors identify potential shifts in market dynamics. Altcoin Season : Defined as a period when the majority of altcoins outperform Bitcoin in terms of price appreciation. Bitcoin Season : Occurs when Bitcoin dominates the market, outperforming most altcoins. A surge in the Altcoin Season Index, such as the 53% jump reported by VanEck, typically signals heightened activity and investment in altcoins. This activity often correlates with increased trading volumes and a more bullish sentiment across the cryptocurrency market. VanEck’s Analysis: Bitcoin and Altcoin Synergy VanEck’s report underscores the symbiotic relationship between Bitcoin and altcoins, suggesting that their price movements are not isolated but interconnected. 1. Bitcoin’s Dominance as a Market Anchor Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of the cryptocurrency market. Its price movements often set the tone for altcoin performance, acting as a leading indicator for broader market trends. Feedback Loop Explained : VanEck explains that as Bitcoin’s price increases, investor confidence grows, leading to higher demand for altcoins. The resulting surge in altcoin prices generates additional liquidity, which can then flow back into Bitcoin, creating a positive feedback loop. 2. Altcoins Pushing Bitcoin to New Highs The report highlights how altcoin rallies often precede major Bitcoin price peaks. This is due to investors seeking higher returns in altcoins during periods of Bitcoin consolidation, which ultimately benefits the entire market. 3. Market Sentiment and Cycle Peaks VanEck suggests that the current Altcoin Season Index surge could indicate that the market is approaching a cycle peak. However, this does not necessarily signal an imminent downturn, as Bitcoin and altcoins have historically sustained extended growth periods during such cycles. The Role of Altcoins in Bitcoin’s Growth Altcoins play a critical role in enhancing the cryptocurrency market’s diversity and liquidity. As new projects emerge with innovative use cases, they attract investment and attention, indirectly benefiting Bitcoin by driving overall market growth. 1. Expanding Use Cases Many altcoins serve specialized purposes, such as enabling decentralized finance (DeFi), powering non-fungible tokens (NFTs), or providing solutions for scalable transactions. These innovations bring new participants into the crypto ecosystem, many of whom eventually invest in Bitcoin. 2. Liquidity and Trading Volume Altcoin rallies often lead to increased trading volume across exchanges. This surge in activity boosts market liquidity, creating favorable conditions for Bitcoin’s price growth. 3. Risk Appetite Among Investors During bullish market phases, investors tend to seek higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities in altcoins. This behavior drives up altcoin prices, creating spillover effects that benefit Bitcoin. A Historical Perspective: Bitcoin and Altcoin Cycles VanEck’s report draws parallels between the current market dynamics and previous cryptocurrency cycles, illustrating how Bitcoin and altcoin interactions have played out in the past. 1. The 2017 Bull Run During the 2017 cryptocurrency boom, Bitcoin’s meteoric rise to nearly $20,000 was accompanied by explosive gains in altcoins. Projects like Ethereum (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC) reached unprecedented highs, reinforcing the feedback loop that VanEck describes. 2. The 2021 Cycle The bull market of 2021 saw a similar pattern, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high of $69,000. Altcoins like Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Binance Coin (BNB) recorded massive gains during this period, highlighting the interplay between Bitcoin and the broader market. 3. The Current Cycle The 53% surge in the Altcoin Season Index suggests that a similar dynamic may be unfolding in the current cycle. With Bitcoin steadily climbing and altcoins gaining momentum, the market appears poised for sustained growth. VanEck’s Bitcoin Growth Projections While the report focuses on the Altcoin Season Index, VanEck also provides an optimistic outlook for Bitcoin’s growth trajectory. Key Factors Driving Bitcoin Growth Institutional Adoption The continued influx of institutional investors into the cryptocurrency market is a major driver of Bitcoin’s price growth. Products like Bitcoin ETFs and custodial solutions are making it easier for traditional investors to participate. Macroeconomic Conditions Bitcoin’s reputation as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation is attracting interest amid global economic uncertainties. Scarcity and Demand With only 21 million Bitcoins ever to be mined, the cryptocurrency’s limited supply creates upward pressure on prices as demand increases. Technological Advancements Developments like the Bitcoin Lightning Network and Taproot upgrade enhance Bitcoin’s utility, driving adoption and boosting its long-term value. Implications for the Cryptocurrency Market VanEck’s findings have significant implications for both Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market: 1. Altcoin Growth Signals Market Maturity The Altcoin Season Index surge indicates a maturing market where investors are exploring a wider range of assets. This diversification strengthens the overall ecosystem. 2. Bitcoin’s Role as a Market Leader Despite the rise of altcoins, Bitcoin remains the dominant player, providing stability and direction for the market. Its ability to create a feedback loop with altcoins highlights its integral role in the crypto economy. 3. Opportunities for Investors The interplay between Bitcoin and altcoins creates opportunities for investors to capitalize on market trends. Understanding these dynamics can help investors make informed decisions about portfolio allocation. Challenges and Risks While the report is bullish, it also acknowledges potential risks that could impact Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market: Regulatory Uncertainty : Changes in government policies could affect market dynamics and investor confidence. Market Volatility : Cryptocurrency prices remain highly volatile, posing risks for short-term investors. Technological Competition : Emerging blockchain projects could challenge Bitcoin’s dominance in the long term. Conclusion VanEck’s report, highlighting a 53% surge in the Altcoin Season Index , provides a compelling case for continued Bitcoin growth. By demonstrating how Bitcoin and altcoins create a mutually reinforcing feedback loop, the analysis underscores the interconnected nature of the cryptocurrency market. As altcoins gain momentum and drive liquidity into the ecosystem, Bitcoin is poised to benefit, potentially reaching new heights in the current market cycle. For investors and enthusiasts, this dynamic offers an exciting glimpse into the future of cryptocurrency as a mature and interconnected asset class.

The fastest of the larger altcoins to plough higher is Solana. $SOL is already up 10% over the last two days. $SOL bounces from strong support Source: TradingView The daily chart for $SOL (SOL/USD) shows a nice bounce from the low of Tuesday. It would be likely that the $SOL bulls push the price back to the top of the channel from here. If this can be achieved, a subsequent breakout gives a measured move to around $275. $SOL bull flag could send price to $345 Source: TradingView The weekly chart highlights that the channel is actually a bull flag. If the price should break out of this structure, the measured move would be much higher, to $345. Very solid price structure is below at $202, and so this is potentially a base for the rest of this bull market. $SOL back inside wedge in relation to its $BTC pair Source: TradingView Against its $BTC pair (SOL/BTC) $SOL is once more back inside the long-term wedge pattern that has been building since the end of 2023. The daily chart above shows that the Stochastic RSI is once more heading to the upside, bringing momentum into $SOL’s favour. $SUI - a layer 1 competitor to watch Source: TradingView One major layer 1 competitor to $SOL, which is having success against a $SOL pairing, is $SUI (SUIUSD/SOLUSD). $SUI is up 320% against $SOL since late July of this year. In the weekly chart above, it can be seen that the SUI/SOL pairing has crossed above a significant resistance level. This current $SUI dip could just be to confirm that this level has now been flipped into support. $SUI is certainly one of the new layer 1s to keep an eye on for the rest of this bull market.

Solana is certainly earning the interest of some investors, trading at $243.07 and up by 7.26% within a span of 24 hours. The recent Grayscale application with the NYSE for a Solana Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) could be instrumental in changing the fortunes of digital currencies. Similar to the clearance of XRP-related filings, the issue is whether SOL may soar to an unparalleled $1,000 should the ETF get regulatory approval. Grayscale’s Solana ETF Filing and Its Significance Titan in the field of digital asset management, Grayscale Investments has formally registered with the NYSE to turn its current Solana Trust into a Solana Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). Aiming to offer a controlled and safe investment path for institutional and retail investors alike, this action reflects the company's past initiatives with its Bitcoin Trust. Grayscale wants to close the distance between conventional finance and cryptocurrencies by making Solana investments more dependable and easily available. Comprising an amazing $134.2 million in assets under management, the Grayscale Solana Trust is the biggest Solana-oriented investment fund. This accounts for almost 0.1% of Solana's current circulation. Given Grayscale's large share in the ecosystem, their ETF would probably increase liquidity and give Solana more credibility as an asset kind. Should it be authorized, Solana might establish itself as a top option for institutional investors looking for blockchain industry exposure The Broader Implications of an Approved Solana ETF Solana ETF approval in the United States could set off a seismic change in SOL's price path. Historically, the launch of controlled investment products such as ETFs has brought new money into the market, usually driving significant price increases for the underlying assets. Here, the XRP experience is instructive; once its legal challenges started to turn in its favor, hope about its possible regulatory adoption drove prices much higher. Experts project Solana's maximum price at $600 should the ETF receive regulatory approval. This estimate considers the predicted flow of institutional money and the growing simplicity of retail market participation for investors. On the other hand, the larger crypto community speculates that Solana might reach $1,000 under suitable market conditions and legislative support. The approval schedule may also quicken. Market players are hopeful about faster ETF approvals since SEC Chair Gary Gensler is to retire in January 2025. Should this occur, Solana's price performance and market capitalization could show an unheard of increase. Even if Solana is still a fierce competitor in the crypto market, a new participant, Rexas Finance (RXS), is starting to take the stage and could eclipse its expected expansion. Rexas Finance (RXS): A Stronger Opportunity Solana makes headlines, but Rexas Finance (RXS) is discreetly positioned as the next major cryptocurrency trend. Pricing at $0.125 per token as of writing, Rexas Finance is in its ninth presale round right now. Already raising more than $23.35 million, the presale reflects great investor confidence. Furthermore, with the expected listing price set at $0.20, participants are assured an almost two-fold return upon listing. With these figures, Rexas Finance offers a more quick and profitable prospect than Solana's speculative climb to $1,000. Rexas Finance's $1 million giveaway is appealing, increasing community involvement. More than 404,000 people have enrolled, keen for a chance to win $50,000 worth of RXS tokens. This marketing operation has greatly raised its uptake and visibility. Leading market analysts say Rexas Finance is set up for a more dramatic price surge than Solana. From its meager presale price of $0.125, RXS is expected to rise to $150, an incredible increase. While remarkable, Solana's climb from $243.07 to $1,000 represents only 311% compared to the possible earnings from Rexas Finance. The potential approval of a Solana ETF by Grayscale is undoubtedly exciting. Under optimal conditions, it could propel SOL to new heights, but Rexas Finance (RXS) is ready to reinvent asset management and provide excessive profits. Participating in the RXS presale today offers investors the next great opportunity to land a token with game-changing potential.

37504731,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=109127,1733921880,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index Falls to 74, Entering ‘Greed’ Zone","The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a widely-followed metric for gauging market sentiment in the cryptocurrency space, dropped to 74 on December 11, 2024. This represents a four-point decline from the previous day, transitioning the market sentiment from the “Extreme Greed” zone into the “Greed” zone. This shift reflects a cooling in the enthusiasm of investors and traders, but the sentiment remains firmly optimistic. As a valuable tool for understanding market psychology, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides critical insights into the emotional state of the crypto market and its potential implications for future trends. Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is an aggregate measure designed to quantify the sentiment of the cryptocurrency market on a scale of 0 to 100: 0–24 : Extreme Fear 25–49 : Fear 50–74 : Greed 75–100 : Extreme Greed At 74 , the current sentiment falls into the “Greed” category, indicating strong bullish activity but not at the euphoric levels associated with “Extreme Greed.” This subtle change could signal the beginning of a more cautious phase for traders, especially as the index is closely linked to price movements and market dynamics. Factors Influencing the Index The Crypto Fear & Greed Index derives its value by analyzing six core factors, each assigned a specific weight: Volatility (25%) Measures price fluctuations and market stability. Higher volatility often correlates with heightened fear, while reduced volatility suggests stability and confidence. Market Momentum/Volume (25%) Tracks trading volume and market momentum to assess the strength of buying or selling activity. A strong upward momentum typically reflects greed, while a decline suggests fear. Social Media Sentiment (15%) Analyzes activity on platforms like Twitter and Reddit, focusing on positive and negative mentions of cryptocurrencies. Surveys (15%) Incorporates sentiment data from investor and trader polls. Bitcoin Dominance (10%) Measures Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. A rising dominance often indicates fear as investors retreat to the perceived safety of Bitcoin. Google Trends (10%) Tracks the popularity of cryptocurrency-related search terms on Google. Increased searches for bullish terms suggest greed, while queries like “crypto crash” indicate fear. By synthesizing data from these six factors, the index provides a comprehensive snapshot of market sentiment at any given time. What Does the Shift from ‘Extreme Greed’ to ‘Greed’ Mean? The drop from “Extreme Greed” to “Greed” signals a slight tempering of investor enthusiasm. While the market remains optimistic, the shift suggests that traders may be taking a more measured approach in response to changing market conditions. Key Implications of the Shift Reduced Risk of Overextension Extreme Greed often indicates that the market is overbought and due for a correction. The decline to Greed could reflect healthier, more sustainable growth. Potential for Short-Term Volatility A cooling sentiment may lead to increased market fluctuations as traders reassess their positions. Cautious Optimism Investors may still expect upward momentum but could be wary of potential risks, such as regulatory announcements or macroeconomic developments. How Traders Use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a valuable tool for traders looking to time their market entries and exits. By understanding market sentiment, traders can make more informed decisions and mitigate risks. 1. Identifying Market Tops and Bottoms Extreme Greed : Often signals that the market is overbought and a correction is imminent. Extreme Fear : Suggests that the market may be undervalued, presenting potential buying opportunities. 2. Assessing Momentum Traders can use the index to gauge whether the current sentiment supports a continued trend or indicates an impending reversal. 3. Managing Risk By monitoring shifts in sentiment, traders can adjust their strategies to minimize exposure during periods of heightened volatility. The Role of Market Psychology in Crypto Cryptocurrency markets are particularly influenced by investor emotions, making the Fear & Greed Index a critical tool for understanding market behavior. Unlike traditional financial markets, which are often driven by fundamentals, crypto markets are highly speculative and subject to rapid sentiment shifts. 1. Fear as a Driver of Panic Selling When sentiment shifts toward fear, traders often rush to sell their holdings, leading to sharp price declines. Understanding this behavior can help savvy investors capitalize on undervalued assets during downturns. 2. Greed as a Catalyst for FOMO Greed fuels the fear of missing out (FOMO), prompting investors to enter the market at higher prices in anticipation of continued gains. While this can drive short-term rallies, it also increases the risk of corrections. Historical Trends in the Fear & Greed Index The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has proven to be a reliable indicator of market cycles, often correlating with major price movements in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. 1. Bull Markets During bullish cycles, the index frequently enters the Greed and Extreme Greed zones as prices surge and optimism dominates. 2. Bear Markets In bearish phases, the index typically resides in the Fear and Extreme Fear zones, reflecting widespread pessimism and selling pressure. 3. Current Context At 74, the index suggests that the market is still in a bullish phase, but the transition from Extreme Greed indicates a potential cooling period before the next major move. External Factors Influencing Sentiment The cryptocurrency market does not operate in isolation. Several external factors can significantly impact the Fear & Greed Index, including: Macroeconomic Conditions Inflation rates, interest rate changes, and geopolitical events often affect investor sentiment across all asset classes, including crypto. Regulatory Developments Announcements from governments or regulatory bodies can shift market sentiment rapidly, either fostering confidence or introducing fear. Technological Advancements Innovations in blockchain technology and new use cases for cryptocurrencies can drive optimism and attract new investors. Media Coverage Positive or negative headlines about cryptocurrencies play a significant role in shaping public perception and influencing the index. Conclusion The recent decline in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 74 , transitioning from “Extreme Greed” to “Greed,” reflects a nuanced shift in market sentiment. While optimism remains strong, the cooling enthusiasm suggests a more cautious approach among traders. For investors, understanding the implications of the Fear & Greed Index is essential for navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. By analyzing the factors that drive sentiment and recognizing historical patterns, traders can make informed decisions and capitalize on opportunities in both bullish and bearish phases. As the crypto market continues to evolve, tools like the Fear & Greed Index will remain invaluable for assessing the emotional pulse of investors and anticipating potential market movements.

37504686,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=109130,1733921822,"U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs See $437.3M in Net Inflows on December 10, Led by BlackRock","On December 10, 2024, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw total net inflows of $437.3 million , marking the ninth consecutive day of positive inflows. This impressive streak highlights growing investor confidence in Bitcoin ETFs as an accessible and regulated means of gaining exposure to the leading cryptocurrency. The largest contributor to the day’s inflows was BlackRock’s IBIT , which recorded $294.46 million in net inflows. Fidelity’s FBTC followed with $210.48 million, while Grayscale’s mini BTC and ARK Invest’s ARKB brought in $6.42 million and $5.77 million, respectively. However, not all ETFs experienced growth. Grayscale’s GBTC, Invesco’s BTCO, and VanEck’s HODL faced outflows of $62.82 million, $11.56 million, and $5.45 million, respectively. Other ETFs reported no significant net inflows or outflows. This surge in net inflows reflects the continued adoption of Bitcoin ETFs, underscoring their importance in bridging traditional finance and the cryptocurrency market. Spot Bitcoin ETFs: A Growing Asset Class Spot Bitcoin ETFs allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. Unlike futures-based Bitcoin ETFs, spot ETFs are backed by actual Bitcoin held in custody, offering a more direct connection to the cryptocurrency’s performance. The consistent inflows over the past nine days demonstrate the increasing appeal of these products to institutional and retail investors alike. Spot Bitcoin ETFs provide: Regulated Exposure : They operate under strict guidelines set by financial authorities, reducing risk for investors. Ease of Access : Investors can trade Bitcoin ETFs on traditional stock exchanges, eliminating the complexities of buying and storing Bitcoin. Lower Barriers to Entry : Spot Bitcoin ETFs are designed to attract mainstream investors who may be hesitant to navigate the crypto market directly. BlackRock Leads the Pack with IBIT BlackRock’s IBIT ETF dominated the inflows on December 10, with $294.46 million in net additions. As the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock’s entry into the Bitcoin ETF market has been a major confidence booster for the industry. Reasons Behind BlackRock’s Success Reputation and Trust : BlackRock’s strong reputation in traditional finance makes its Bitcoin ETF a preferred choice for risk-averse investors. Institutional Appeal : The firm’s global reach and influence have attracted significant institutional interest. Robust Infrastructure : BlackRock leverages its advanced financial infrastructure to offer seamless access to Bitcoin through IBIT. With such substantial inflows, BlackRock continues to set the pace in the rapidly growing Bitcoin ETF space. Fidelity’s FBTC Gains Momentum Fidelity’s FBTC ETF was the second-highest performer of the day, bringing in $210.48 million in net inflows. Fidelity’s long-standing commitment to cryptocurrencies, coupled with its reputation for innovation, has positioned it as a key player in the market. Why Fidelity’s FBTC Is Attracting Investors Early Crypto Adoption : Fidelity has been a pioneer in crypto, offering digital asset services since 2018. Diverse Investor Base : The firm’s extensive client network includes retail investors, high-net-worth individuals, and institutions. Efficient Custody Solutions : Fidelity’s secure custody services add an extra layer of confidence for investors. The strong inflows into FBTC underscore Fidelity’s growing influence in the Bitcoin ETF space. Other ETFs See Mixed Results While some ETFs reported significant inflows, others experienced outflows, reflecting varying investor sentiment: Grayscale’s mini BTC : A modest $6.42 million inflow shows continued interest in Grayscale’s offerings, despite competition from larger players. ARK Invest’s ARKB : With $5.77 million in inflows, ARK remains a niche choice for investors seeking innovative asset exposure. On the other hand, outflows were recorded by: Grayscale’s GBTC : A significant $62.82 million outflow highlights challenges for the once-dominant crypto trust as it competes with newer ETFs. Invesco’s BTCO : Outflows of $11.56 million suggest waning interest. VanEck’s HODL : A $5.45 million outflow reflects investor caution. The Nine-Day Streak: A Reflection of Investor Confidence The ninth consecutive day of net inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs is a strong indicator of market optimism. This trend suggests that investors view Bitcoin ETFs as a reliable vehicle for cryptocurrency exposure, especially in a volatile market environment. Key Drivers of the Inflows Streak Institutional Adoption Institutional investors are increasingly turning to Bitcoin ETFs as a safe and regulated way to participate in the crypto market. Macro-Economic Factors Concerns about inflation and currency devaluation are driving demand for Bitcoin as a store of value. Regulatory Clarity The approval and success of spot Bitcoin ETFs have enhanced confidence in the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies. Challenges and Risks in the Bitcoin ETF Market Despite the positive trend, the Bitcoin ETF market is not without challenges. Investors should be aware of the following risks: Market Volatility Bitcoin’s price remains highly volatile, which can impact ETF performance. Regulatory Uncertainty While the current environment is favorable, future regulatory changes could affect the market. Competition The growing number of Bitcoin ETFs means increased competition, which could dilute individual ETF performance. The Role of Spot Bitcoin ETFs in Market Maturity The rise of spot Bitcoin ETFs represents a significant milestone in the cryptocurrency market’s evolution. By providing a bridge between traditional finance and digital assets, these products are fostering greater adoption and liquidity. Benefits for the Broader Market Increased Accessibility Spot ETFs make Bitcoin investment easier for retail investors unfamiliar with crypto exchanges. Enhanced Credibility The involvement of reputable firms like BlackRock and Fidelity adds legitimacy to the market. Boosted Liquidity The influx of capital through ETFs contributes to market liquidity, stabilizing Bitcoin prices. Conclusion The $437.3 million in net inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on December 10 reflects a strong and growing appetite for regulated Bitcoin investment products. With BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC leading the charge, the ETF market is becoming an essential gateway for institutional and retail investors alike. While challenges remain, the consistent inflows highlight the role of spot Bitcoin ETFs in driving market maturity and increasing adoption of digital assets. As investor confidence grows, these products are poised to play a pivotal role in the future of cryptocurrency investment.

This marks a three-point decline from the previous day but still indicates that the market is firmly in Altcoin Season , as defined by the index’s scoring methodology. Tracked by cryptocurrency data platform CoinMarketCap (CMC), the index excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens, focusing instead on the top 100 cryptocurrencies. For a market to qualify as being in Altcoin Season, at least 75% of these coins must have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. The index ranges from 1 (Extreme Bitcoin Dominance) to 100 (Extreme Altcoin Dominance) and is updated daily. What Is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index serves as a benchmark for evaluating the strength of altcoins relative to Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency market has long been dominated by Bitcoin as its flagship asset, but the rise of altcoins has created cycles where alternative cryptocurrencies outperform Bitcoin.

Data Source Tracks the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) listed on CoinMarketCap. Performance Basis Compares the 90-day performance of altcoins against Bitcoin to determine relative strength. The Altcoin Season Index provides valuable insights for traders and investors, helping them identify periods when altcoins may offer better returns than Bitcoin. What Does a Score of 62 Indicate? A score of 62 suggests that the market remains in Altcoin Season , albeit with a slight decline in relative strength compared to the previous day. Significance of Altcoin Season Market Sentiment : Altcoin Season typically reflects bullish sentiment toward alternative cryptocurrencies, signaling increased risk appetite among investors. Portfolio Diversification : Investors often look to diversify their portfolios during this phase, seeking higher returns from altcoins. Trading Volume Shifts : Altcoin Season is often accompanied by increased trading volumes in smaller cryptocurrencies, which can lead to greater price volatility. While the three-point drop in the index might suggest a minor shift, the market’s overall positioning in Altcoin Season remains unchanged, indicating continued interest in altcoins. How Is Altcoin Season Defined? To determine whether the market is in Altcoin Season or Bitcoin Season, the index evaluates the percentage of top 100 altcoins that outperform Bitcoin. Altcoin Season Criteria : At least 75% of altcoins outperform Bitcoin. Bitcoin Season Criteria : Fewer than 25% of altcoins outperform Bitcoin.

TRON enables content consumers to reward creators directly, eliminating intermediaries like YouTube or Facebook. The platform supports smart contracts and decentralized applications, allowing developers to build dApps on its network. Using a transaction model similar to Bitcoin, TRON records transactions on a public ledger where users can track operations.

The surge, as revealed by DL News , underscores a dramatic rise in interest among retail investors in the cryptocurrency market. Similarly, Robinhood, a popular trading platform for both stocks and cryptocurrencies, experienced a 400% increase in crypto trading volume from October to November . This trend highlights a renewed enthusiasm for digital assets as market dynamics evolve and retail investors seek opportunities in the ever-growing crypto space. eToro’s 500% Surge: A Closer Look eToro’s remarkable 500% increase in crypto trading volume is a testament to the platform’s growing role in the digital asset market. The platform, which allows users to trade cryptocurrencies alongside traditional assets like stocks and commodities, has seen a surge in user engagement and trading activity. Key Drivers of eToro’s Growth Retail Investor Participation Retail investors have increasingly turned to platforms like eToro to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies. User-friendly interfaces and educational resources make these platforms accessible to novice traders. Expanding Crypto Offerings eToro has consistently expanded its list of tradable cryptocurrencies, attracting a diverse range of investors seeking exposure to popular assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as emerging altcoins. Social Trading Features eToro’s innovative social trading model allows users to follow and copy the trades of experienced investors, lowering the barrier to entry for new participants. Robinhood: A 400% Monthly Increase in Crypto Trading Robinhood, another major player in the retail trading space, reported a 400% increase in crypto trading volume between October and November 2024 . Known for its commission-free trading model, Robinhood has become a go-to platform for retail investors exploring both stock and cryptocurrency markets. Robinhood’s Role in the Crypto Surge Seamless User Experience Robinhood’s simple and intuitive app design appeals to retail traders, particularly those new to investing. Wide Reach With a large user base primarily consisting of millennials and Gen Z investors, Robinhood has played a significant role in popularizing cryptocurrencies among younger demographics. Low-Cost Access The platform’s zero-commission trading model makes it an attractive choice for cost-conscious investors. Why Is Crypto Trading Volume Soaring? The rise in trading volumes on platforms like eToro and Robinhood can be attributed to several key factors: 1. Retail Investor Interest The primary driver of the increase in crypto trading volume has been a surge in interest from retail investors. Access to Information : The widespread availability of online resources and social media discussions has educated retail investors about cryptocurrencies. Market Recovery : After periods of volatility, signs of market recovery have reignited interest among retail traders. FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) : The potential for significant returns in the crypto market continues to attract retail participants. 2. Broader Adoption of Cryptocurrencies The adoption of cryptocurrencies by major companies and financial institutions has legitimized the market, encouraging retail investors to participate. Bitcoin ETFs : The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs has provided a regulated avenue for institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin. Mainstream Use Cases : Cryptocurrencies like Ethereum are powering real-world applications in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). 3. Macro-Economic Factors Inflation Hedging : Cryptocurrencies are increasingly viewed as a hedge against inflation, drawing investors during times of economic uncertainty. Global Accessibility : Unlike traditional financial markets, crypto markets are open 24/7, offering unparalleled accessibility to global investors. The Impact of eToro and Robinhood’s Growth on the Market The significant increases in trading volumes on eToro and Robinhood have broader implications for the cryptocurrency market: 1. Increased Liquidity Higher trading volumes contribute to greater liquidity in the market, making it easier for traders to execute large transactions without significantly impacting prices. 2. Price Volatility While increased participation boosts liquidity, it can also contribute to price volatility, particularly during periods of heightened speculation. 3. Market Maturity The sustained interest in cryptocurrencies by retail investors is a sign of market maturity, as digital assets transition from niche investments to mainstream financial instruments. A Historical Perspective on Crypto Trading Volume The current surge in crypto trading volume is not unprecedented. Previous bull runs have also seen dramatic increases in activity: 2017 ICO Boom The initial coin offering (ICO) craze in 2017 attracted millions of retail investors, leading to record trading volumes on exchanges. 2021 DeFi and NFT Mania The rise of DeFi protocols and NFTs in 2021 spurred another wave of interest, driving trading volumes to new heights. 2024: A New Wave of Adoption The 500% year-on-year increase reported by eToro reflects a renewed wave of adoption, fueled by increased institutional participation and advancements in blockchain technology. Challenges Facing Retail Trading Platforms Despite their success, platforms like eToro and Robinhood face several challenges: 1. Regulatory Scrutiny As trading volumes grow, regulators worldwide are paying closer attention to cryptocurrency platforms to ensure compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) requirements. 2. Competition The rise of new trading platforms and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) presents competition for established players. 3. Volatility Management Platforms must ensure they can handle surges in trading activity without experiencing outages or disruptions. The Road Ahead: What to Expect The sustained growth in crypto trading volumes suggests a promising future for both retail platforms and the broader cryptocurrency market. For Retail Platforms Continued innovation, such as the introduction of new cryptocurrencies and trading tools, will be key to maintaining user engagement. Partnerships with institutional players could help platforms attract a more diverse user base. For the Market Greater participation by retail investors will drive liquidity and adoption, setting the stage for future growth. Advances in blockchain technology and new use cases for digital assets will continue to fuel interest in cryptocurrencies. Conclusion The 500% year-on-year increase in crypto trading volume on eToro , coupled with Robinhood’s 400% monthly rise , underscores the growing interest in cryptocurrencies among retail investors. This trend reflects the broader adoption of digital assets as a mainstream investment class. As trading volumes continue to soar, platforms like eToro and Robinhood will play a pivotal role in shaping the future of cryptocurrency markets.

37504524,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=109139,1733921507,"Eric Trump Says Bitcoin is a Better Investment Than Real Estate, Highlighting Liquidity and Future Potential","Eric Trump , son of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, has declared Bitcoin (BTC) a superior investment compared to real estate. Speaking at the Bitcoin MENA 2024 Conference , Eric highlighted Bitcoin’s advantages in terms of liquidity, efficiency, and future potential. Despite coming from a family that amassed its wealth through real estate, Eric argued that Bitcoin offers a more dynamic and forward-looking investment opportunity. In a backstage interview with JinSe Finance , he outlined how Bitcoin addresses key limitations inherent in real estate investments, such as long timelines, reliance on intermediaries, and vulnerability to physical risks. According to Eric, embracing cryptocurrency is an investment in the future, where early adopters are poised to thrive while laggards risk missing out on transformative opportunities. Why Eric Trump Sees Bitcoin as Superior to Real Estate Eric Trump’s stance on Bitcoin as a better investment than real estate stems from several key factors: 1. Liquidity Bitcoin’s high liquidity was one of the primary advantages Eric highlighted. Real Estate Constraints : Constructing a hotel, a common investment avenue in the Trump family, can take up to five years, with an additional two years often required to sell the property. These long timelines can tie up capital and limit financial flexibility. Bitcoin Advantage : Unlike real estate, Bitcoin can be bought or sold instantly, offering unparalleled liquidity. This makes it an attractive option for investors seeking flexibility and quick access to their funds. 2. Elimination of Intermediaries Real estate transactions often involve a host of intermediaries, including bankers, lawyers, and brokers, which can increase costs and slow down processes. Bitcoin’s Efficiency : Bitcoin transactions occur on a decentralized blockchain, removing the need for intermediaries and reducing costs. The absence of middlemen streamlines investments and provides greater control to the investor. 3. Resistance to Physical Risks Eric pointed out that real estate is susceptible to physical threats like fires, floods, hurricanes, and other natural disasters. Bitcoin’s Durability : As a digital asset, Bitcoin is immune to physical damage. It can be securely stored in digital wallets and accessed globally, reducing the risk of loss or destruction. 4. Future-Oriented Investment Bitcoin, according to Eric, represents a future-focused investment opportunity . Adoption Curve : Eric believes that cryptocurrency is still in its early adoption phase, making it an opportune time for forward-thinking investors to enter the market. Technological Advancement : Bitcoin and blockchain technology are driving financial innovation, creating opportunities that traditional assets like real estate cannot match. The Challenges of Real Estate Investment Eric’s remarks highlight several challenges associated with real estate investments, particularly when compared to Bitcoin: 1. Illiquidity Real estate is inherently illiquid, with transactions often requiring months or even years to complete. This lack of liquidity can hinder investors’ ability to respond quickly to market changes or take advantage of new opportunities. 2. High Costs and Complexity From maintenance expenses to legal fees, real estate involves significant costs and complexities that can eat into returns. Bitcoin, by contrast, offers low transaction fees and a simplified investment process. 3. Geographic Limitations Real estate investments are tied to specific locations, which can limit diversification. Bitcoin, being digital, is borderless and allows investors to participate in a global market. 4. Vulnerability to External Factors Real estate is subject to risks such as market downturns, zoning changes, and natural disasters. These factors make it less predictable compared to Bitcoin’s decentralized and secure nature. Bitcoin: A Modern Investment Opportunity Bitcoin’s appeal as an investment lies in its revolutionary approach to value storage and transfer. For Eric Trump, this positions Bitcoin as the asset of the future. 1. Decentralized Financial System Bitcoin operates on a decentralized blockchain, which eliminates the need for central authorities like banks or governments. This independence makes it a robust hedge against inflation and political instability. 2. High Growth Potential Bitcoin’s historical performance has demonstrated significant growth over the years. As institutional adoption continues to rise, its long-term potential remains promising. 3. Accessibility Investing in Bitcoin is straightforward and accessible to anyone with an internet connection, democratizing investment opportunities across the globe. 4. Inflation Hedge Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins makes it a valuable store of wealth in times of rising inflation, contrasting with real estate, which can fluctuate with market conditions. The Trump Family and Real Estate Legacy Eric’s endorsement of Bitcoin is notable given the Trump family’s longstanding association with real estate. The Trump Organization, led by Donald Trump, has built a global portfolio of properties, including luxury hotels, residential developments, and commercial real estate. While Eric acknowledged the wealth his family has built through real estate, his remarks suggest a recognition of the limitations of traditional investments in today’s rapidly evolving financial landscape. Eric Trump on Early Adoption Eric stressed the importance of early adoption, drawing parallels between Bitcoin and other groundbreaking technologies. Embracing Innovation : Eric likened investing in Bitcoin now to being an early adopter of the internet or personal computers, where those who recognized the potential early on reaped significant rewards. Risk of Hesitation : He warned that investors who hesitate to embrace cryptocurrency risk falling behind as blockchain technology continues to disrupt traditional industries. Challenges and Risks of Bitcoin Investment While Eric Trump is bullish on Bitcoin, potential investors should also consider the challenges and risks associated with the asset: 1. Volatility Bitcoin’s price can be highly volatile, with significant fluctuations occurring over short periods. This volatility can lead to substantial losses if not managed carefully. 2. Regulatory Uncertainty The global regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, and changes in policies could impact Bitcoin’s value and accessibility. 3. Security Concerns Although Bitcoin itself is secure, the storage and management of digital wallets require caution to avoid hacking or phishing attacks. 4. Lack of Tangibility Unlike real estate, Bitcoin is a digital asset with no physical presence, which may deter traditional investors who value tangible assets. Conclusion Eric Trump’s assertion that Bitcoin is a better investment than real estate underscores the shifting dynamics in the world of finance and investment. His arguments around liquidity, efficiency, and future potential highlight Bitcoin’s unique advantages in an increasingly digital economy. While traditional investments like real estate will always have their place, Eric’s comments reflect the growing recognition of Bitcoin as a transformative asset class. For investors seeking to diversify their portfolios and embrace innovation, Bitcoin represents a compelling opportunity.

On one side, we have the meme-fueled frenzy of $PEPE Coin, riding the waves of internet humor and bold speculation. On the other, we have Lightchain AI, a revolutionary blockchain ecosystem blending artificial intelligence and decentralization to solve real-world problems. The Lightchain AI Presale is now live—don’t miss your chance to be part of this groundbreaking project. Join now to claim your tokens . Both projects paint a picture of the growing variety in the cryptocurrency market, but they reflect drastically different philosophies. Let's take a closer look at both to see where their value lies and help you determine if you're a meme enthusiast, an innovation seeker—or perhaps a little bit of both. Why Lightchain AI Is Leading the Charge in Innovation Unlike meme coins, which often rely on hype, Lightchain AI stands out for offering practical applications and cutting-edge features designed to future-proof the blockchain ecosystem. It introduces two groundbreaking technologies that make it a standout player in the crypto space: 1. Proof of Intelligence (PoI) Lightchain AI’s Proof of Intelligence (PoI) is a groundbreaking consensus mechanism that rewards nodes for performing beneficial AI computations, such as model training and optimization tasks. Unlike resource-hungry Proof of Work or wealth-focused Proof of Stake, PoI ensures meaningful contributions while maintaining network security. Imagine a blockchain network where nodes actively advance artificial intelligence instead of solving arbitrary computational puzzles. This not only improves scalability and efficiency but also helps reduce energy consumption—an ongoing concern in the blockchain space. 2. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) At the heart of Lightchain AI lies the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), a revolutionary computational layer designed to handle AI-specific tasks flawlessly on the blockchain. Developers can harness AIVM’s capabilities to deploy robust, decentralized applications (dApps) tailored to advanced AI operations. It evolves continuously by leveraging inputs from a global developer community, ensuring it stays at the forefront of innovation. Lightchain AI doesn’t just stop at offering unique technology. It focuses on community-driven governance via decentralized voting, ensures complete transparency with its auditable AI framework, and supports real-world applications like supply chain management, data processing automation, and decentralized finance environments. ✅ Lightchain AI Key Features Eco-friendly Proof of Intelligence mechanism AI-powered dApps via AIVM Decentralized governance for transparent decision-making Practical applications transcending industries Lightchain AI token (LCAI) available at discounted prices during presale Be a part of blockchain transformation today— participate in the Lightchain AI presale and secure your stake in the future. Pepe Coin’s Allure—Memes, Fun, and Pure Speculation On the flip side, we have Pepe Coin ($PEPE), which rides on the cultural phenomenon of the internet-famous “Pepe the Frog” meme. It exemplifies the meme coin market philosophy of leveraging humor, community, and hype to create value. For many, Pepe Coin isn’t about utility; it’s about fun, speculation, and the dream of catching a moonshot opportunity. While it lacks the technological depth of projects like Lightchain AI, here’s what Pepe Coin offers: 1. Community-Driven Hype Meme coins like Pepe Coin thrive on community engagement. These projects often create fervent online communities that act as marketers, spreading the word through social media platforms like Reddit, Discord, and Twitter (now X). With memes acting as a universal language, Pepe Coin has seen massive engagement globally. 2. High Risk-Reward Potential Pepe Coin isn’t for the faint of heart. Its value is driven almost entirely by speculation, meaning it can soar overnight—or crash just as quickly. For those who thrive on risk and enjoy the unpredictability of the market, this kind of asset might be appealing. 3. Accessibility Getting in on the fun is relatively easy, as Pepe Coin is available on many leading cryptocurrency exchanges. This accessibility, coupled with its affordability, makes it an attractive option for newcomers to cryptocurrency. $PEPE vs Lightchain AI Technological Innovation 👉 Winner: Lightchain AI, with its AI-driven features like PoI and AIVM Real-World Use Cases 👉 Winner: Lightchain AI, which prioritizes solving actual problems in industries Community Engagement 👉 Winner: Pepe Coin, leveraging meme culture for massive online impact Risk/Reward Profile 👉 Winner depends on your appetite for risk—Pepe Coin for thrill-seekers, Lightchain AI for those seeking long-term value Choosing Between Meme Power and Cutting-Edge Utility Both Pepe Coin and Lightchain AI embody different sides of the cryptocurrency spectrum. Pepe Coin caters to those drawn to the excitement and camaraderie of meme culture and speculation, while Lightchain AI offers substantial, real-world value through technological innovation. For investors looking to contribute to and benefit from meaningful blockchain applications, Lightchain AI is the clear choice . It combines blockchain and AI to tackle major industry challenges, ensuring it plays a pivotal role in the future of decentralized technology. For those who enjoy the ride and are willing to take a gamble, Pepe Coin might offer the excitement you’re looking for. The Future Is Bright with Lightchain AI The choice is yours—do you want to bank on the potential of a meme, or do you want to invest in game-changing innovation? The Lightchain AI Presale is your chance to be part of a revolutionary ecosystem at the ground level. With every LCAI token, you help shape the future of decentralized intelligence. Don’t wait— secure your discounted tokens today and join a growing community that’s redefining blockchain innovation. Key Takeaways Lightchain AI is pioneering blockchain-AI synergy with solutions like Proof of Intelligence and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine. Pepe Coin leverages the cultural power of memes but lacks technological depth and utility. Lightchain AI offers long-term value and real-world applications for crypto investors seeking meaningful investments. 🌐 Explore more about Lightchain AI and its presale at the links below: Website: https://lightchain.ai Whitepaper: https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Twitter/X: https://x.com/LightchainAI Telegram: https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

37504473,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=109143,1733921396,Hong Kong to Accelerate Crypto Platform Licensing and Introduce Custody Licenses by 2024,"Hong Kong to Accelerate Crypto Platform Licensing and Introduce Custody Licenses by 2024 Hong Kong is ramping up its efforts to establish itself as a global hub for cryptocurrency, accelerating the licensing process for crypto trading platforms and planning new regulations for stablecoins and custodians. Joseph Chan , Acting Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury (FSTB), announced these initiatives in a statement reported by The Block . The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) is spearheading efforts to streamline the licensing process. Additionally, the government is proposing a consultative panel for licensed platforms to enhance regulatory clarity and engagement. Licensing requirements for crypto custodians are also in development, with plans to roll out both measures by 2024. Streamlining Crypto Licensing in Hong Kong Hong Kong’s proactive approach to licensing aims to simplify and accelerate the approval process for crypto trading platforms. This initiative reflects the government’s ambition to attract global players and foster innovation in the digital asset space. 1. SFC’s Consultative Panel The proposed consultative panel for licensed platforms will be operational by early 2024. Purpose : To provide licensed platforms with a direct channel to engage with regulators, ensuring compliance and facilitating the exchange of insights. Impact : This panel aims to foster a collaborative environment, reducing uncertainty for crypto platforms navigating the regulatory landscape. 2. Simplified Licensing Process The SFC plans to streamline the licensing process for crypto trading platforms by cutting red tape and ensuring a more efficient approval system. Goals : Reduce application timelines and improve transparency. Outcome : A faster, more accessible process could attract more crypto businesses to establish operations in Hong Kong. Introducing Crypto Custody Licenses Recognizing the critical role of custodians in securing digital assets, Hong Kong plans to introduce licensing requirements for crypto custodians in 2024. Why Crypto Custody Matters Custodians are responsible for safeguarding digital assets, reducing risks associated with theft, loss, or fraud. Proper regulation in this area is essential for building investor trust and fostering institutional adoption. Proposed Custody Framework Key Elements : Minimum capital requirements for custodians. Enhanced security standards for digital asset storage. Regular audits to ensure compliance and transparency. Expected Benefits : Greater investor protection. Increased confidence among institutional participants. Stablecoin Regulation: The Next Frontier In addition to platform and custody licensing, Hong Kong is turning its attention to stablecoin regulation . Why Stablecoins Are a Priority Stablecoins are widely used in cryptocurrency trading and payments due to their price stability. However, they also pose unique risks, including liquidity challenges and lack of transparency. Hong Kong’s Approach The government plans to introduce a robust regulatory framework for stablecoins in 2024, focusing on: Issuance Standards : Ensuring issuers maintain sufficient reserves to back their stablecoins. Transparency Requirements : Mandating regular disclosures to prevent fraud and promote trust. Integration with Licensed Platforms : Regulating the use of stablecoins within licensed trading platforms to enhance overall market stability. Hong Kong’s Vision for a Crypto Hub Hong Kong’s accelerated licensing efforts and proposed regulatory frameworks are part of a broader strategy to establish itself as a leading crypto hub. 1. Attracting Global Players Streamlined processes and clear regulations are designed to attract major global crypto firms to Hong Kong. Market Impact : Increased participation from international players could boost liquidity and innovation in Hong Kong’s crypto market. 2. Encouraging Innovation The government’s proactive stance sends a strong signal to innovators and entrepreneurs that Hong Kong is open for business. Focus Areas : Blockchain technology, decentralized finance (DeFi), and digital payments. 3. Enhancing Investor Confidence By addressing key areas like custody and stablecoin regulation, Hong Kong aims to provide a secure environment for both retail and institutional investors. Global Context: Hong Kong vs. Competing Jurisdictions Hong Kong’s efforts come amid growing competition from other crypto-friendly jurisdictions like Singapore, Dubai, and Switzerland. How Hong Kong Stands Out Strategic Location : Hong Kong’s position as a financial gateway to China offers unique advantages for global firms. Proactive Regulation : Unlike jurisdictions with ambiguous rules, Hong Kong is establishing clear, actionable frameworks. Commitment to Innovation : Government-backed initiatives signal strong support for the digital asset industry. Challenges and Risks While Hong Kong’s initiatives are ambitious, several challenges remain: 1. Regulatory Complexity Balancing innovation with investor protection requires nuanced regulations, which can be difficult to implement effectively. 2. Market Competition Other jurisdictions with established crypto ecosystems could outpace Hong Kong if their regulatory processes are perceived as more favorable. 3. Adoption Barriers Encouraging adoption among traditional financial institutions and retail investors will require significant education and trust-building efforts. The Road Ahead: What to Expect in 2024 Hong Kong’s accelerated licensing process and new regulatory measures set the stage for a transformative year in its crypto ecosystem. Key Milestones to Watch Launch of the Consultative Panel : Early 2024. Implementation of Crypto Custody Licenses : By mid-2024. Stablecoin Regulatory Framework : Expected by the end of 2024. Market Implications For Crypto Firms : A more predictable regulatory environment could attract new entrants and encourage existing players to expand operations. For Investors : Enhanced regulations will likely boost confidence, driving greater participation in Hong Kong’s crypto market. Conclusion Hong Kong’s decision to speed up crypto platform licensing and propose custody licenses reflects its commitment to becoming a global leader in the cryptocurrency space. With plans to regulate stablecoins and create a consultative panel for licensed platforms, the city is laying the groundwork for a secure, innovative, and investor-friendly crypto ecosystem. As these initiatives unfold, Hong Kong is poised to solidify its position as a major crypto hub, balancing innovation with robust regulation. For industry players and investors, the city’s proactive stance offers both opportunities and confidence in the future of digital assets.

Moo Deng (MOODENG) Moo Deng is a tiny pygmy hippopotamus who lives at the Khao Kheow Open Zoo in Thailand. At just two months old, she became an internet sensation in September 2024 when her cute photos and videos captured hearts worldwide. With her chubby cheeks and playful antics, Moo Deng has brought joy to many. Her energetic personality and lovable traits have made her a favorite among fans who can't get enough of her adorable charm. Now, Moo Deng's legacy is immortalized on the Solana blockchain with the launch of Moon Deng. This new coin embraces her spirit and aims to reach new heights. Built on Solana's fast and efficient technology, Moon Deng offers potential for growth in the current market. As cryptocurrencies evolve, Moon Deng stands out with its unique story and community support. While big names like Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate the scene, Moon Deng brings fresh excitement. Joining her journey could be an opportunity to be part of something fun and promising in the crypto world. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu, or SHIB, is capturing attention as more than just a meme-inspired cryptocurrency. Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous creator Ryoshi, SHIB takes inspiration from Dogecoin but seeks to carve its own path. It operates on the Ethereum blockchain, making it compatible with a wide range of decentralized applications. This Ethereum foundation allows SHIB to be part of projects like ShibaSwap, its own decentralized exchange. Remarkably, half of its initial quadrillion tokens were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. His donation of a large portion to the India Covid Relief Fund and the burning of the remaining tokens brought SHIB into the spotlight. What sets SHIB apart is its vision for the future. Plans are underway for a dedicated NFT platform and a community-led governance system using a DAO model. This suggests that SHIB is striving for lasting presence in the crypto market, not just fleeting fame. In a market cycle where investors are looking for coins with real-world applications and solid technology, SHIB's integration with Ethereum could give it an edge. While the crypto space is crowded with new tokens, SHIB's blend of meme culture and ambitious projects makes it a unique contender worth watching. SPX6900 (SPX) In a world where digits on a screen hold immense power, SPX6900 has burst onto the scene. Born from internet culture, this meme token dreams big—it's on a quest to surpass the S&P 500 by reaching an astonishing $69 trillion market cap. The logic is playful yet bold: since 6900 is much larger than 500, SPX6900 must be superior to traditional financial tools. This lighthearted thesis captures the spirit of the token as it sails toward financial domination, fueled by the belief that bigger numbers make for better investments. SPX6900 taps into the energy of online communities and the viral nature of memes. Like other meme coins before it, its strength lies in collective enthusiasm rather than technical innovation. In today's market, where unconventional assets can skyrocket overnight, SPX6900 presents an intriguing opportunity. It stands out amid trends favoring community-backed tokens and could attract those looking for the next big thing. While it may not boast cutting-edge technology, its bold mission and simplicity make it a captivating player in the crypto world. Whether it will reach its lofty goal is uncertain, but it undoubtedly adds excitement to the current market landscape. Popcat (POPCAT) Meet POPCAT, the latest meme coin that's taking the internet by storm. Inspired by the viral Popcat meme from October 2020, this coin brings the fun of 'Oatmeal' the cat to the crypto world. The meme features two images of the adorable feline: one with a closed mouth and another with a surprised 'O' face. Now, fans can enjoy this meme in a new way with the POPCAT token, a coin created purely for entertainment. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, POPCAT has no inherent value or financial expectations. It's all about the joy of sharing a laugh and embracing internet culture. In a market crowded with serious projects and complicated technologies, POPCAT stands out as a lighthearted alternative. While it might not be a traditional investment, its popularity could rise as more people join in the fun. In the current market cycle, where meme coins often gain sudden attention, POPCAT could be an amusing addition to the crypto conversation. Conclusion Although MOODENG, SHIB, SPX, and POPCAT are promising, XYZVerse (XYZ) uniquely blends memes and sports, targeting 20,000% growth and aiming to become the G.O.A.T of memecoins.

37504441,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=374278,1733921314,Important Binance Announcement Affecting PEPE Traders: Details,"TL;DR Binance announced another delisting effort, this time involving PEPE and two other altcoins. The price of the frog-themed token has plummeted daily. Its pullback could be a result of Binance’s announcement and the recent bloodbath in the meme coin sector. Removing These Pairs The world’s biggest crypto exchange periodically reviews all pairs on its platform “to protect users and maintain a high-quality trading market.” As such, it delists some due to various factors, such as poor liquidity and trading volume. Based on its latest evaluation, Binance will terminate the following spot trading pairs: PEPE/TUSD, DCR/BTC, and ZEN/ETH. The effort will come into effect on December 13. “The delisting of a spot trading pair does not affect the availability of the tokens on Binance Spot. Users can still trade the spot trading pair’s base and quote assets on other trading pair(s) that are available on Binance,” the company clarified . A delisting spree launched by a major exchange like Binance usually has a negative effect on the underlying cryptocurrencies due to reduced liquidity, reputational damage, and other reasons. The frog-themed meme coin Pepe (PEPE) , for example, is down 7% on a daily scale. DCR has dipped by 4%, while somewhat surprisingly, ZEN is up 2%. PEPE Price, Source: CoinGecko It is worth mentioning that PEPE’s poor performance could also be linked to the massive red wave that has recently passed through the entire meme coin sector. In any case, PEPE’s price crash could have been much more substantial should Binance decided to remove it entirely from its platform. Recall that the altcoins Rupiah Token (IDRT), Keep3rV1 (KP3R), Ooki Protocol (OOKI), and Unifi Protocol DAO (UNFI) collapsed by double digits in November when the firm terminated all services with them. A similar price drop was observed in February when Binance suspended trading services for Monero (XMR) and three other altcoins. The well-known privacy token experienced a decline of more than 20% soon after the news . The Opposite Effect On the other hand, when cryptocurrencies are added to Binance, their prices are often positively affected due to increased accessibility, a boost in market confidence, and other factors. In November, the firm introduced PONKE/USDT perpetual contracts, which allow up to 75x leverage. The price of the Solana-based meme coin PONKE soared by 15% minutes after the disclosure. Simon’s Cat (CAT) experienced an even more significant rally in October when Binance launched 1000CATUSDT perpetual contracts on its futures program.

37504426,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=109145,1733921304,Solana Funding Rate Drops 81% in Two Days as Market Sentiment Weakens,"The funding rate for Solana (SOL) has plunged by a staggering 81% over the past 48 hours, signaling a significant shift in market sentiment. According to a report from BeInCrypto , traders are increasingly hedging against potential downside risks, reflecting growing caution within the market. This bearish trend is compounded by a decline in Solana’s active addresses, which have fallen to their lowest level in December. The decrease in user engagement and investor interest points to a weakening outlook for the blockchain network and its native cryptocurrency. Understanding the Funding Rate Drop The funding rate is a critical metric in the cryptocurrency futures market. It represents the periodic payment made between traders based on the difference between perpetual contract prices and spot prices. Positive Funding Rate : Indicates bullish sentiment, as long traders pay short traders. Negative Funding Rate : Reflects bearish sentiment, as short traders pay long traders. What Does an 81% Drop in Funding Rate Mean? The sharp drop in Solana’s funding rate suggests that: Increased Hedging : Traders are actively hedging their positions to protect against potential price declines. Bearish Sentiment : A growing number of traders expect Solana’s price to decrease in the near term. Decline in Solana’s Active Addresses The fall in Solana’s funding rate coincides with a decline in the number of active addresses on the network. This metric measures the total number of unique wallet addresses participating in transactions over a given period. Current Trends Lowest Levels in December : The number of active addresses on Solana’s blockchain has dropped to a monthly low, signaling reduced user engagement. Implications for the Ecosystem : Declining activity suggests weakening interest from both retail users and institutional participants. What’s Driving the Bearish Sentiment Around Solana? Several factors are contributing to the shift in sentiment and the weakening of Solana’s on-chain metrics: 1. Market Volatility The cryptocurrency market has experienced heightened volatility, prompting traders to adopt more cautious strategies. Impact on Solana : As a high-growth, high-risk asset, Solana is particularly vulnerable to shifts in market sentiment. 2. Declining Investor Confidence The drop in active addresses suggests that users and investors are becoming less confident in Solana’s near-term potential. Possible Causes : Network issues or outages. Increased competition from other layer-1 blockchains like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Avalanche. 3. Broader Market Trends Solana’s decline is also influenced by macroeconomic factors and the performance of the overall cryptocurrency market. How Traders Are Reacting The drop in Solana’s funding rate indicates that traders are increasingly taking defensive positions to mitigate risks. 1. Increased Short Positions Bearish sentiment has led to a rise in short positions, as traders bet on further price declines. 2. Reduced Exposure Some investors are reducing their exposure to Solana, reallocating funds to more stable assets or other high-potential cryptocurrencies. The Impact on Solana’s Ecosystem The weakening sentiment and declining engagement could have broader implications for Solana’s ecosystem: 1. Developer Activity Reduced investor confidence and user activity could deter developers from building on the Solana blockchain, impacting innovation and network growth. 2. DApp Usage Decentralized applications (DApps) on Solana may experience lower user engagement, affecting their sustainability and revenue models. 3. Market Position Solana’s position as a leading layer-1 blockchain could be challenged if the trend of declining activity and investor interest continues. What Needs to Change for a Rebound? Solana can regain its footing by addressing the factors contributing to the current downturn. 1. Boosting User Engagement The network must attract more active users through targeted incentives, partnerships, and community-building initiatives. 2. Enhancing Network Stability Addressing any ongoing technical issues or outages will be critical to restoring user trust and confidence. 3. Expanding Use Cases Solana should focus on diversifying its ecosystem by supporting a broader range of applications, from DeFi and NFTs to gaming and enterprise solutions. Long-Term Outlook for Solana Despite the current challenges, Solana’s long-term potential remains strong. Its high-speed, low-cost blockchain has positioned it as a competitive alternative to Ethereum and other layer-1 networks. Strengths to Build On Scalability : Solana’s ability to handle high transaction volumes makes it attractive for developers and users. Community Support : A loyal and active community provides a solid foundation for recovery and growth. Risks to Monitor Market Competition : Rival blockchains with similar capabilities could erode Solana’s market share. Economic Uncertainty : Macro-level factors, including interest rates and regulatory changes, could impact the entire crypto sector. Conclusion The 81% drop in Solana’s funding rate over two days, coupled with declining active addresses, reflects a significant shift in market sentiment. While these trends signal near-term challenges, Solana has the tools and community support needed to recover and regain its position as a leading blockchain platform. To bounce back, Solana must address technical and user engagement challenges, while continuing to innovate and expand its ecosystem. For traders and investors, the current downturn may present both risks and opportunities, emphasizing the importance of staying informed and vigilant in a rapidly changing market.

ChatGPT estimates Dogecoin's price might rise to $4.74 in 45 days, fuelling anticipation of a market surge that could include SHIB and Rexas Finance (RXS). This trio could alter market trends with Dogecoin's tenacity and community-driven momentum, Shiba Inu's history of riding DOGE's coattails, and Rexas Finance's novel method to tokenizing real-world assets. These investments could yield high short-term gains as investors prepare for a bullish surge. Dogecoin (DOGE): ChapGPT’s Aligns With Experts Projection DOGE was once considered a dangerous asset, but its use in facilitating payments has made it a safer investment, especially for corporations. While economists expect DOGE to grow to $3.60 during the next market boom, ChatGPT's wild projection of $4.74 in 45 days has investors optimistic. This forecast shows Dogecoin's affordability and public appeal, driving demand and acceptance. However, experts warn that quick expansion could cause profit-taking and a drop after essential resistance levels. Meme coins are speculative, but Dogecoin's short-term profits make it a good investment for anyone willing to handle volatility. This evolution makes DOGE a meme coin leader and a symbol of widespread cryptocurrency acceptance. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Taking A Path as Dogecoin Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin's fun adversary, has grown into a utility-driven token using Ethereum's strong blockchain. SHIB has garnered global interest due to its mystery founder, Ryoshi and Vitalik Buterin's dramatic contribution and burn. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB has a burgeoning ecosystem, including ShibaSwap, NFTs, and decentralized governance, supported by Ethereum's adaptability. Based on its history of riding DOGE's momentum during market rallies, Shiba Inu is poised to follow DOGE to $4.74 in 45 days, as ChatGPT predicts. SHIB's ecosystem utility and popularity as a meme coin appeal to speculative traders and serious crypto aficionados. Ethereum's scalability and SHIB's continual incorporation into DeFi could lift the token's price, replicating Dogecoin's and solidifying its position among this market’s top performers. Rexas Finance (RXS): A Token that is Bound to Rise to $4.75 ChatGPT's bold prediction that Rexas Finance (RXS) will rise to $4.74 in 45 days shows its potential as a crypto market disruptor. RXS is at its ninth presale round, drawing investor interest after reaching $0.125 per token, a considerable increase from its initial presale. Rexas Finance, a pioneer in asset tokenization, uses blockchain technology to allow users to own or trade real-world assets like real estate, fine art, commodities, and intellectual property. RXS's accessibility, liquidity, and efficiency position it to redefine asset management. Rexas Finance simplifies and democratizes investing, opening up endless opportunities for investors to embrace decentralized finance. RXS's rise to $4.74 shows its value and strengthens its position as a tokenization and blockchain game-changer. Why is the $4.75 Price Feasible? ChatGPT predicts Dogecoin will grow to $4.74 in 45 days, and Rexas Finance (RXS) is well-positioned to replicate this due to its community-driven base and clever market maneuvers. Rexas Finance has avoided venture capital, creating a more diverse and enthusiastic investor base that believes in the token's long-term ambition. The company's $1 million giveaway to 20 lucky participants, who will receive $50,000 RXS tokens, has increased public interest and early adopter commitment, bolstering this community-centric approach. The token's recent listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko have increased its awareness, drawing more crypto fans. Rexas Finance's presale price rose 320%, demonstrating investor confidence. RXS's 320 million coin sales show the market's enthusiasm for its prospects, notably in real-world asset tokenization. Having been verified by Certik, Rexas Finance has been positioned in the same situation as Dogecoin as a reliable investment in crypto. Due to its strategic penetration and self-fulfilling market dynamic, Rexas Finance is well-positioned to capitalize on Dogecoin's rally's bullish emotion and achieve parallel success in a short timescale. Conclusion Dogecoin's expected rise to $4.74 in 45 days sets the foundation for an explosive market rally, with Shiba Inu and Rexas Finance primed to follow. Dogecoin's large following and growing utility as a payment option makes it a meme coin leader, while Shiba Inu's ecosystem and historical alignment prepare it for success. However, Rexas Finance is a prospective disruptor, combining meme coins' speculative appeal with asset tokenization breakthroughs. Its strong presale growth, strategic awareness, and dedicated investment community suggest it might thrive alongside Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. These coins show how volatile the crypto market is and provide investors with significant short-term chances.

Movement ( MOVE ) soared to a high of $1.45 Monday, a gain of more than 135% from its low of $0.616. MOVE has since retraced and is trading for $0.65 at time of writing, down 13.1% in the last 24 hours. With a market cap of $1.46 billion, it is the 96th-largest crypto project. Coinbase added the “experimental label” to MOVE, which the platform assigns to tokens that pose certain risks such as price swings and canceled orders because of lower trading volume and availability. MOVE also recently gained support on top crypto exchange Binance and Korean crypto exchange Upbit. Move is a programming language originally built by a consortium backed by tech giant Meta for the now-defunct Diem project. It was then used to develop layer-1 blockchains Sui ( SUI ) and Aptos ( APT ). Earlier this year, venture capitalist Chris Burniske called attention to the Movement ecosystem. Said Burniske, “I think it’s worth paying attention to – even though it’s very small at this point – the Move ecosystem so things like Movement, Aptos, Sui… People are not really talking about that ecosystem right now in a way that I find interesting, because I always like to go where people aren’t talking about something much.

37505700,https://invezz.com/?p=2383049,1733921084,Raydium outshines Uniswap as RAY breakout signals continued gains,"While digital assets see a sigh of relief with Bitcoin jumping above $98,000, altcoins are swiftly rebounding. Raydium’s RAY led the gainers within the past day, following a 29.24% price surge. Besides the ongoing broad market recovery, bullish ecosystem developments contributed to the alt’s outperformance in the past 24 hours. The latest stats show Raydium has outshined Uniswap as the leading decentralized exchange in 30-day trading volume for two consecutive months. Raydium dominates DeFi Raydium has performed well after emerging as the top DEX by trading volume in October. Its dominance over the Solana ecosystem, which heated during the latest meme coin craze, contributed to Raydium’s success. Messari @MessariCrypto · Follow In October, @RaydiumProtocol emerged as the leading DEX by trading volume across all chains.This trend accelerated in November, with Raydium processing $124.6 billion in monthly volume, surpassing Uniswap’s $90.5 billion by 30%. 7:35 PM · Dec 10, 2024 101 Reply Copy link Read 7 replies According to Messari’s reporter Matt Kreiser , October was Raydium’s first month as the number one DEX by volume across all chains. This trend accelerated in November with Raydium eclipsing Uniswap in monthly DEC volume by roughly 30% ($124.6 billion vs $90.5 billion) These stats showcase Raydium’s increasing popularity within the decentralized finance world. Such trends add to the narrative that experts trust might lead to the disruption of established DEXs such as Uniswap. RAY’s price performance The exchange’s native token maintained an uptrend within the past day. It climbed from $4.4368 to a 24-hour peak of $5.7340 – a 29.24% surge. RAY trades at $5.55 and seems to boast what it takes for new all-time highs of $7 (in the near term). Source: Coinmarketcap The daily chart supports the upside stance, showcasing a pullback after a massive rally. Nonetheless, the recovery absorbed the bearish range from $6.50 to $4.43 – a 32% decline within 17 days. However, robust uptrends over the past day triggered a bullish resurgence and pushed RAY past the $5.0 psychological mark. That has opened the path toward the nearest hurdle at the 23.6% FIB level ($5.65). Moreover, the 4H MACD and signal lines have approached a bullish divergence, supporting the shifting dynamics. Trend-based FIB levels on the daily timeframe signal a potential rally to the 50% FIB zone at $7.01. That would mean a new all-time high for RAY before the new year. The channel breakout RAY’s pullback phase prints a descending channel setup on the 4H timeframe. Source: TradingView The prevailing rally has formed a V-shaped reversal, breaking past the upper trendline. The altcoin surpassed the $5.33 resistance with solid bullish candlesticks. RAY’s recovery indicates possibilities of hitting the descending channel’s pinnace – at $6.34. That might see the coin hitting record highs of $6.68. Broad market sentiments support Raydium’s recovery as analysts expect explosive upswings after the recent double-digit losses in the altcoin market. The platform’s success in the DeFi sector will be crucial in driving stable price growth in the upcoming sessions.

XRP (XRP) XRP (XRP) has seen significant volatility in recent times. Over the past week, its price dropped by 25.46%, landing within the current range of $2.22 to $2.95. Despite this short-term decline, the cryptocurrency has experienced impressive growth over the longer term, with a 263.24% increase in the past month and a 313.35% rise over the last six months. Technical indicators present a mixed outlook. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 37.29, suggesting that XRP is approaching oversold territory. The Stochastic oscillator sits at 24.11, which may indicate potential for a price correction. The Simple Moving Average over 10 days is $2.13, compared to the 100-day SMA of $2.41, hinting at recent bearish momentum. Key levels to watch are the nearest support at $1.83 and resistance at $3.30. If the price moves below the support, the next level is $1.09. On the upside, breaking past the resistance could lead to testing the second resistance level at $4.03. These levels represent significant percentage changes from the current price range, and traders are monitoring them closely. Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) has seen significant price movement recently. In the past week, its price fell by 21.03%, landing between $1.06 and $1.33. Despite this drop, ADA's price surged by 91.15% over the last month. Over six months, it has risen by 116.89%, highlighting strong long-term growth. Technical indicators are mixed for ADA. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is around 38.3, suggesting approaching oversold conditions. The Stochastic is near 23.0, also pointing to potential overselling. The MACD level is negative at -0.0358, indicating bearish momentum. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $0.98, below the 100-day average of $1.14, which can be a bearish signal. ADA faces resistance at $1.46. Breaking above this could lead to the next target at $1.73, offering potential gains of about 10% and 30%. The nearest support is at $0.92; dropping to this level would mean a decrease of roughly 13%. A further drop to the second support at $0.65 would imply more significant losses. Given the oversold indicators, there may be room for a rebound, but bearish signals suggest caution. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) has experienced notable price fluctuations recently. In the past week, its price decreased by 15.80%. Despite this short-term drop, the token saw a 22.75% increase over the past month and a 13.46% rise in the last six months. Currently, SHIB is trading between $0.00002805 and $0.00003489. The coin's nearest resistance level is at $0.00003759. Breaking this could lead SHIB towards the second resistance at $0.00004442. On the support side, the nearest level is $0.00002390, with a secondary support at $0.00001706. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $0.00002613, which is below the current price, indicating a recent upward trend. The 100-day Simple Moving Average stands at $0.00003024. Technical indicators suggest potential movement. The Relative Strength Index is at 37.11, hinting that SHIB is approaching oversold territory. The Stochastic indicator reads 21.90, also suggesting possible upward momentum. The MACD level is slightly negative at -9.962e-7, reflecting mild bearish sentiment. Considering these factors, SHIB's price may test its resistance levels soon if buying pressure increases.

37504486,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=625816,1733920886,FTX recovers $14.5 million from settlement of 27 small claims,"FTX Bankruptcy estate settled 27 small claims against political donation beneficiaries in November. In a filing before the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, the exchange administrators noted that they recovered about $14.5 million from the settlements. Most of the settlement involved small amounts, sometimes as low as $2,900 from Jared Moskowitz for Congress or $7,500 from the Vermont Democratic Party. However, there were still some large recoveries, with the House Majority PAC and Senate Majority PAC returning $6 million and $3 million, respectively. The recoveries mark a major win for the FTX estate, which instituted the small estate claims order against several entities over the past few months to recover money donated to political campaigns and groups by the exchange’s former executives. However, the recovered funds represent a minute amount compared to the billions of dollars the bankrupt exchange is currently sitting on and planning to distribute to creditors. FTX and 3AC locked in dispute over claims Meanwhile, FTX is still contending with other claims by entities that believe the exchange owes them more than it acknowledges. One such entity, the bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) , filed a motion last month to adjust its claims from $120 million to $1.5 billion. FTX has already objected to this expansion, noting that it is baseless and that it happened after the deadline, whereas 3AC had access to the account data before the deadline. The exchange also claimed that the damages alleged were market-driven and not due to its actions. However, 3AC bankruptcy administrators have now filed a reply to the objection, noting that FTX failed to respond early to its motion and that the deadline did not pass as the British Virgin Islands (BVI) six-year statute of limitation applies here. They also noted that FTX has a disputed claims reserve of $6.5 billion, which is $3.4 billion above allowed claims. The bankrupt hedge fund is already gathering evidence to prove its claims with a pending deposition motion against three former executives now in prison – Sam Bankman-Fried, Ryan Salame, and Caroline Ellison – and a subpoena against Nishad Singh. Interestingly, Salame is facing a clawback lawsuit from FTX and has hired attorneys to defend himself. Uncertainty about when creditors will be paid After two years of legal drama surrounding FTX Bankruptcy, the exchange’s creditors continue to wait for the distribution of their funds. Many expect the first distribution to happen by March 2025, when those with claims below $50,000 will be paid. However, bankruptcy attorney Nicholas Hall believes that the expectation might be unrealistic. He noted that recent filings show that the number of claimants who have completed KYC verification is still very low, with only 159,237 customers completing their verification. 30,154 claims are in process, while 451,735 claims have not even started. According to him, the large number of creditors who have yet to complete KYC suggests that processing the remaining claims will be a massive administrative challenge, as FTX will have to verify every submission. Hall further noted that all claimants must complete their KYC by June 1, 2025, as failure could result in creditors losing their claims. He said: “Even if everyone scrambles to meet these dates, FTX still needs time (likely months) to vet submissions, ensure compliance, and finalize the claims register. Realistically, this pushes first meaningful distributions toward late 2025.” The legal expert blamed the slow and laborious claims verification process on the exchange’s poor record-keeping before the bankruptcy petition, which made KYC and transaction data important for FTX in verifying claims. He noted that several claims against the defunct exchange are still unresolved, forcing the bankruptcy estate to reserve funds. FTX has already asked to hold back around $6.5 billion, and Hall believes that until the KYC backlog is clear, major distributions to creditors may be on hold. Thus, due to the massive scope of this bankruptcy, Hall expects that any distribution may not happen until Q4 of 2025.

Crypto Update","The cryptocurrency world thrives on innovation, and with countless projects competing for attention, standing out is no easy task. While TRON (TRX) has been making moves lately, the real buzz seems to surround Lightchain AI, a trailblazer revolutionizing the blockchain space with AI-powered innovation. 🚀 The Lightchain AI Presale is NOW LIVE! Don’t just watch the future unfold—take part in it. Grab your discounted tokens today and gain exclusive access to groundbreaking features. Join the presale here . 🔥 But what makes Lightchain AI such a game-changer? And how does TRON’s latest developments compare to this visionary project? Let’s break it down. What Sets Lightchain AI Apart? Halfway into 2024, Lightchain AI has cemented itself as a forward-thinking platform that merges artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. This isn’t just another crypto project—this is tech innovation at its finest. Proof of Intelligence (PoI): Transforming Consensus Lightchain AI introduces the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) mechanism, which replaces traditional methods like Proof of Work or Proof of Stake. Instead of wasting energy on computational mining tasks, PoI rewards nodes for meaningful AI computations—think model training, data-based optimizations, and intelligent problem-solving. This is efficiency and innovation combined. AI Virtual Machine (AIVM): A New Age of dApps At the heart of Lightchain AI lies the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM). This advanced layer elevates decentralized applications (dApps) with AI capabilities. Imagine dApps that don’t just process data but actively suggest improvements or adapt to user behavior. That’s the power of AIVM in action. Transparent AI Framework Transparency builds trust, and Lightchain AI nails this with its Transparent AI Framework. Every decision made by the AI is auditable, ensuring accountability and credibility in operations. Decentralized Community Governance Lightchain AI balances its tech with community values. Token holders actively participate in governance, ensuring decisions are aligned with the collective vision. This fusion of AI efficiency and human input symbolizes a new benchmark for decentralized platforms. Want to learn more about these groundbreaking features? Check out the Lightchain AI whitepaper . Why Lightchain AI is the Investment to Watch Lightchain AI is much more than a blockchain platform—it’s an evolving ecosystem. From its innovative partnerships to its roadmap that includes a Testnet rollout, enhanced validator nodes, and scaling advancements, this project has every ingredient for success. Early adopters benefit from discounted tokens, governance participation, and priority access to emerging features. 💡 Now’s the time to grab your spot in this digital evolution. Join the Lightchain AI Presale today and secure the future of decentralized AI innovation. Where Does TRON (TRX) Fit Into This? While Lightchain AI ushers blockchain into the AI-driven age, TRON (TRX) has been making its own strides in the crypto space. Known for its focus on decentralized content distribution, TRON has solidified its presence as an entertainment-focused blockchain. TRON’s Latest Developments TRON’s ecosystem recently celebrated several advancements: Rise in Daily Transactions: TRON hit a record number of transactions this quarter, showcasing the growing popularity of its decentralized apps and services. USDT Dominance: TRON became the leading blockchain for Tether (USDT) transactions, highlighting its efficient and low-cost operations. Decentralized Governance Gains: Like Lightchain AI, TRON is also pushing for more comprehensive governance through its Super Representative model. Strengths of TRON TRON’s key advantage lies in its scalability and ability to process transactions quickly at low fees. Additionally, its partnerships with major brands make it a familiar name in the cryptocurrency world. Where TRON Falls Short However, when it comes to cutting-edge innovation, TRON seems to lack the visionary edge that Lightchain AI brings to the table. While TRON focuses on refining existing structures, Lightchain is redefining what blockchain technology can achieve by merging it with artificial intelligence. TRON vs. Lightchain AI: The Key Takeaways Feature TRON (TRX) Lightchain AI Core Focus Decentralized Content Distribution AI-Powered Blockchain Innovation Consensus Model Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) Proof of Intelligence (PoI) Advanced AI Capabilities None AI Virtual Machine (AIVM) Transparency & Auditing Limited Transparent AI Framework Community Governance Yes Strong Governance Integration While TRON has a solid reputation, Lightchain AI is paving the way for the future with its bold vision and revolutionary technologies.

However, new and revolutionizing coins are demonstrating they are the best options for investors wanting to see their investment amounts increased substantially. On a modest initial investment of $500, certain altcoins can deliver returns capable of transforming dreams into reality. One of the top challengers is Yeti Ouro (YETIO), an exciting DeFi-powered MemeFi token. With $1,000,000 already raised in the first stage of presale, $YETIO is capturing the attention of investors all over the world. Current Market Analysis: DOGE And SHIB Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have intrigued investors for years. After dropping to $0.39 Dogecoin price began a steady climb throughout the year, thanks mainly to community support and additional use cases. As it stands, Shiba Inu coin is firmly planted as one of the top altcoins with a strong fanbase and ecosystem growth bolstering their position. Still these coins will most certainly not be providing the same exponential gains in the past, as the market caps have grown considerably meaning there is much less range from one point to the next. By changing the landscape, early investors now have the potential for life-changing returns, and new players have a space to move in. Yeti Ouro: A Strong Candidate For 2024 Of all the altcoins battling for investor interest, Yeti Ouro has emerged as a quick favorite. An ETH-based utility token that represents a whole different approach to business. In its first presale stage, it has already raised over $1,000,000. YETIO has already sold 83% of its first batch on strong demand from buyers. The potential of YETIO is quite promising. Analysts believe that by the end of 2024, it could reach $0.1 as it gains a foothold in P2E. Based on its current trajectory YETIO could be worth between $1.50-$2 in 2025, In addition, firm market research predicts that the price of YETIO will be $10 or more in 2030. YETIO's gaming world is rapidly growing, and its DeFi features are being adopted on a massive scale. Other Coins To Watch Cronos (CRO): The native token of Crypto.com, CRO serves utility as a trading fee discount and DeFi application. Now at $0.17, CRO continues to show strength and natural growth potential as users flock to its platform. Floki Inu (FLOKI): Floki remains popular with investors, thanks to its active community and updates to its ecosystem. It has less market cap than DOGE and SHIB, which gives it more room to grow in the upcoming days. Pepe Coin: The headlines have been dominated by Pepe's price explosions. Although it is a meme coin, it has some innovative features, and the community support keeps it relevant. Why Yeti Ouro Stands Out Where other coins are hype-driven, Yeti Ouro eventually has utility. They have immersed themselves in the Yeti Go game, creating an adaptive audio media experience for many people who are prepared to invest in their subliminal marketing. At the same time, its P2E system will draw in users more interested in play and profit combined than just P2E alone. How To Maximize Gains Diversifying is critical to turning $500 into $50,000 a year. Yeti Ouro definitely has the most potential, but mixing it with tokens such as Cronos and Floki may increase your overall risk-to-reward ratio. Get in on the Yeti Ouro presale at $0.012 to lock in your tokens at the bottom ahead of the inevitable avalanche. Final Thoughts Investors looking for exponential returns, it all comes down to finding undervalued tokens with high potential. Yeti Ouro ticks all the right boxes with its fresh approach and early momentum. This new DeFi altcoin needs a place in your portfolio, whether you are an experienced trader or just starting.

Cup and Handle Pattern Forms on SHIB Weekly Chart The expert made the projection yesterday, referencing the formation of a cup-and-handle pattern on Shiba Inu’s weekly chart. The emergence of the cup-and-handle pattern typically represents a bullish signal for Shiba Inu. https://twitter.com/astekz/status/1866581264985362898According to the chart, the cup section began in March 2024, when Shiba Inu surged to $0.000045, to November when it surpassed the $0.3 mark after a correction. The handle section reflects Shiba Inu’s surge above the $0.33 mark this month before its pullback to around $0.26. Asteks suggests that a potential breakout might be the next play for Shiba Inu, with the chart pointing to a target of $0.00003237. At the current price of $0.00002697, Shiba Inu must surge by 20.02% to clinch the $0.00003237 target. Shiba Inu Slumps to $0.000024 Amid Bitcoin-Led Drawdown The Bitcoin-led market downturn has wreaked devastating havoc on Shiba Inu’s performance. Following Bitcoin’s rollercoaster movement yesterday, Shiba Inu dipped to $0.00002434 before rebounding above the $0.000026 level. Priced at $0.00002697, Shiba Inu has witnessed a slight decline of 0.31% in the past 24 hours. However, the doggy-themed token has incurred a double-digit loss of 11.15% in the past week. Imminent Breakout Looms for Shiba Inu Besides Asteks, other crypto experts have recently taken to X to predict an imminent surge for Shiba Inu. In a recent tweet, popular memecoin-focused market observer Whales HQ forecasted that Shiba Inu is preparing for a massive breakout. The accompanying chart shows an ascending triangle pattern on the 4-hour chart, signaling an imminent upward movement for Shiba Inu. Furthermore, popular community expert Shib Spain pointed out that the token is retesting a critical support level around the $0.000024 mark. If this support holds, the expert projects that Shiba Inu could rally significantly to $0.0000520.

37504108,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51844,1733920238,Real-World Asset Tokenization Reaches New Heights With Qubetics as Binance Focuses on Decentralization and Tron Targets Blockchain Gaming,"Have you ever wondered which altcoins could potentially give you the highest returns in the current crypto market? With countless projects vying for attention, choosing the right one can feel like finding a needle in a haystack. But recent updates surrounding Binance and Tron, along with the buzz about Qubetics ($TICS) presale , have given crypto enthusiasts plenty to talk about. Qubetics is emerging as a solution to some of the biggest challenges in the blockchain space, offering real-world asset tokenization and a promising investment opportunity. With its presale in full swing, now is a great time to dive deeper into what sets Qubetics apart while comparing it with the giants Binance and Tron. Qubetics Is Revolutionising Asset Tokenization Qubetics ($TICS) is a rising star among the best altcoins to buy now , offering a unique way to connect digital assets with real-world value. The platform’s focus on real-world asset tokenization sets it apart. It enables the seamless conversion of physical and digital assets like real estate, intellectual property, commodities, and more into tradable digital tokens. This innovation opens doors for individuals and businesses alike to access opportunities that were once exclusive to institutional players. The ongoing Qubetics presale is in its 12th stage, where tokens are priced at $0.031 each. So far, over 303 million $TICS tokens have been sold to 8,300 holders, raising more than $5.4 million. Every presale stage lasts seven days, ending on Sunday at midnight, and is followed by a 10% price increase. For instance, investing $86,000 now would yield significant returns based on analysts’ predictions. If the price reaches $1 after the presale, the ROI could be over 3,112%. At $15, the ROI skyrockets to an incredible 48,093%. The real-world applications of Qubetics are equally impressive. Imagine a small business owner tokenizing their property to raise capital or an artist selling fractional ownership of their digital artwork. These scenarios show how Qubetics creates opportunities for everyone, not just seasoned investors. If you’re interested in learning more, this video dives deeper into the project. Binance Is Expanding Its Reach Despite Regulatory Pressure Binance, a household name in the crypto world, continues to dominate the market despite facing regulatory scrutiny. Recent news highlights that Binance is doubling down on compliance by withdrawing from certain markets while enhancing its offerings elsewhere. For example, Binance has reportedly completed the sale of its Russian unit to focus on regions with more favourable regulatory environments. This strategy aims to strengthen its global footprint without compromising its operational integrity. Additionally, Binance’s launch of its decentralised stablecoin protocol, Venus, has gained attention. Venus allows users to mint stablecoins by staking various cryptocurrencies, providing a new avenue for earning yields. Analysts suggest that Binance’s move into decentralised finance could solidify its position as a market leader. The platform’s reputation for reliability and innovation makes Binance a strong contender in the search for the best altcoins to buy now. But its challenges in navigating complex regulatory landscapes serve as a reminder that even the most established platforms face hurdles. Tron Is Strengthening Its Blockchain Ecosystem Tron is making waves in the blockchain space with its focus on decentralised applications and smart contracts. Recent reports show that Tron’s user base has grown significantly, reaching over 180 million accounts. This growth is largely attributed to its efficient blockchain network, which supports high transaction speeds and low fees. In a recent update, Tron announced partnerships with several gaming platforms to bring blockchain-based games to its ecosystem. This move aims to capture the attention of younger, tech-savvy audiences. Additionally, Tron is enhancing its staking rewards, making it an attractive choice for investors looking for passive income opportunities. While Tron’s focus remains on building a robust ecosystem, its reliance on a centralised figure like Justin Sun continues to spark debates in the crypto community. However, the platform’s ability to consistently roll out updates and partnerships makes it a strong competitor among the best altcoins to buy now. Conclusion Whether you’re drawn to Binance’s innovations, Tron’s growing ecosystem, or Qubetics’ revolutionary approach to asset tokenization, these projects offer unique opportunities for investors. Qubetics stands out with its focus on real-world applications and impressive presale metrics, making it a solid choice for anyone looking to diversify their portfolio. If you’re curious about what makes Qubetics special, don’t forget to check out this video for a deeper understanding of its potential. With the presale price set to increase soon, now might be the time to consider $TICS as one of the best altcoins to buy now.

With the crypto market constantly evolving, it’s crucial to keep an eye on projects offering unique solutions. Recent developments with Toncoin and Chainlink have caught attention, showcasing impressive use cases and growth potential. However, Qubetics ($TICS) is making waves with its revolutionary approach to real-world asset tokenization. Unlike older blockchain projects, Qubetics is designed to tackle real-life problems with its cutting-edge Web3 aggregator and tokenized assets marketplace. As its presale gains momentum, many investors are turning to $TICS, making it a hot topic in crypto circles. Qubetics Is Changing the Game with Real-World Asset Tokenization Qubetics is proving to be one of the best altcoins to buy this week, thanks to its groundbreaking tokenized assets marketplace . By converting physical and digital assets—like real estate, intellectual property, and commodities—into tradable tokens, it makes previously exclusive investment opportunities accessible to everyone. For example, imagine an artist tokenizing their digital art. Buyers can own a fraction of the artwork without purchasing the entire piece, creating a new way for creators to monetise their work. Businesses can also use Qubetics to tokenize assets such as warehouses or patents, allowing them to unlock liquidity while retaining ownership. These practical applications make Qubetics a standout project. The presale of $TICS is currently in its 12th stage, with tokens priced at $0.031. Over 303 million $TICS tokens have been sold to 8,300 holders, raising $5.4 million. With just seven days per stage and a 10% price increase every Sunday at midnight, the opportunity to buy early is limited. For example, a $436,000 investment at this stage could grow exponentially: If $TICS reaches $0.25 by the presale’s end, the ROI is 703.21%. At $1, it’s 3,112.86%. At $15 after the mainnet launch, ROI soars to 48,092.91%. These numbers highlight why Qubetics is considered one of the best altcoins to buy this week . If you’re curious about its potential, you can learn more by watching this video . Toncoin Gains Traction with Enhanced Network Features Toncoin has been making headlines recently with its focus on Telegram integration and blockchain scalability. According to a recent update, the Telegram Open Network (TON) is rolling out enhanced wallet features within the app, aiming to bring crypto to its 700 million users. This seamless integration is expected to boost Toncoin’s adoption significantly. Toncoin is also attracting attention for its low transaction fees and energy efficiency, making it a viable option for both developers and end-users. For instance, the TON blockchain processed over 3.6 million transactions daily in the last week, showing its capacity to handle high network activity without breaking a sweat. Additionally, partnerships with decentralised finance (DeFi) platforms have added utility to Toncoin, enabling staking and lending opportunities. Analysts suggest that these developments could push Toncoin further up the ranks of the best altcoins to buy this week. Chainlink Expands Use Cases with New Oracle Solutions Chainlink is another project catching attention for its innovative approach to blockchain interoperability. Recent news revealed that Chainlink has launched its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), enabling secure communication between different blockchains. This development could make Chainlink indispensable for projects needing reliable data feeds. The platform’s growing adoption by DeFi and enterprise clients has been remarkable. In the past month, Chainlink secured over $20 billion in total value locked (TVL) across its ecosystem, cementing its position as a critical player in the blockchain world. Moreover, Chainlink has partnered with top DeFi platforms to provide price oracles, a service that has become a cornerstone of decentralised finance. With its robust infrastructure and increasing adoption, Chainlink remains a top pick among the best altcoins to buy this week. Conclusion Whether you’re drawn to Qubetics’ real-world applications, Toncoin’s integration with Telegram, or Chainlink’s cutting-edge oracle solutions, each project offers unique opportunities for investors. Qubetics shines with its focus on tokenized assets and exceptional ROI potential, especially as the top crypto presale enters its later stages. With its practical use cases and promising growth, it’s no surprise why $TICS is seen as one of the best altcoins to buy this week.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Yeti Ouro emerges as a top contender, challenging Shiba Inu’s dominance with presale success and strong utility in gaming and DeFi. Table of Contents Shiba Inu struggles in a competitive environment Floki gains momentum Yeti Ouro: The altcoin make waves in the crypto realm Conclusion The crypto landscape is ever-changing, as some tokens lose their shine and others reign supreme. Once a top contender in the meme coin space, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is now in heated competition. Analysts now expect it to be replaced with Floki (FLOKI) and a new rising star, Yeti Ouro (YETIO). Yeti Ouro is a viral altcoin to watch, having seen over $1 million raised in record time. Shiba Inu struggles in a competitive environment Shiba Inu coin has long been a fan favorite, riding the wave of meme coin hype. However, recent performance has left many wondering if its dominance is fading. Despite some price recoveries, SHIB faces challenges in maintaining its momentum. Whales, who once drove its growth, appear to have shifted focus to emerging projects with stronger utility and community support. Floki gains momentum Another meme-inspired cryptocurrency, Floki , has been slowly gaining traction. Floki sits outside just the meme coin group and approaches a larger audience with NFTs and a DeFi platform as a part of its ecosystem. Its aggressive marketing strategy and dedicated community are seen as placing it as a potential rival to Shiba Inu. You might also like: How high Ripple and Yeti Ouro will go now that BTC has surpassed $100K Yeti Ouro: The altcoin make waves in the crypto realm Yeti Ouro crosses the $1 million milestone, making it one of the most popular presale tokens in 2024. Such swift fundraising exhibits not just the community’s strength but also the powerful utility and unique functionalities that boost Yeti Ouro’s attractiveness. Yeti Ouro is not another meme coin. It combines meme appeal with actual utility, especially in the gaming and DeFi sectors. This is its unique selling point, as it has integrated its high-energy Play-to-Earn (P2E) racing game, Yeti Go. This mix of entertainment value and investment opportunity has attracted both gamers and investors in the crypto space. The success of the presale for Yeti Ouro is a clear indication of investor confidence in the project. Over 84 million tokens have been sold, representing 84% of Stage 1 as early buyers seize the chance at just $0.012 for a token before the cost rises in later phases. The utility, innovation, and vision behind Yeti Ouro take it to the next level. Unlike many other tokens, YETIO is highly integrated with the gaming and DeFi ecosystem. With its capped supply of 1 billion tokens, staking rewards, and burn mechanisms, it is both a sustainable and potentially lucrative investment. Conclusion As Shiba Inu attempts to hold on to its throne, others are thriving. Look at Floki and Yeti Ouro. With its record-breaking presale and unique approach to combining gaming and crypto,Yeti Ouro has already demonstrated its potential. Investors have a limited time to act, as 83% of Stage 1 tokens remain. Yeti Ouro is not just a viral token as the crypto market evolves. It is a utility-focused and immersive gaming experience backed by a supportive community that can be a force to be harnessed for 2024 and beyond. For both gamers and investors, Yeti Ouro presents a chance to get involved with something special. To learn more about Yeti Ouro community, visit the website , X , Telegram , and Discord.

37503912,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4743464-btcw-not-compelling-investment-despite-sponsor-fee-waiver?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,1733920200,BTCW: Not A Compelling Investment Despite The Sponsor Fee Waiver,"Summary Bitcoin ETFs like WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund ETF are gaining interest, but BTCW has underperformed Bitcoin due to various fees and expenses. Despite BTCW's superior returns compared to other Bitcoin spot ETFs, it still lags behind direct BTC-USD holdings by nearly 10 percentage points. The fund's underperformance is attributable to custody fees and non-recurring expenses; this despite the sponsor fee waiver. I recommend selling BTCW and investing directly in BTC-USD, considering the ongoing expense drag on NAV growth. With Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) staying stubbornly under the major psychological milestone of $100k for the past several weeks alongside rising volatility since July (chart below), Bitcoin ETFs such as the WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund ETF ( BTCW ) are gaining significant interest amongst investors. As a side note, although the $100k price barrier was broken several times in the last week, BTC-USD remains under that level for now, and volatility is on the rise again. CVI.Finance This higher level of interest from investors can be seen from the ETF's sudden AUM surge that began in a strong way in early August, with a short period of consolidation and then a sharp rise toward the $380 million-plus mark where it now stands. Data by YCharts This coincided with the early August rally for BTC-USD when it briefly breached the $62k level. That rally failed to last, as seen below, and BTC began a brief consolidation phase. TradingView Bitcoin did breach that level again toward the end of August, but by the beginning of September, the crypto was back at $54k. The following rally took it over $65k, and despite the increasing volatility, BTC kept creating new highs until the presidential election results were out. From the pre-election-results level of near $68k, Bitcoin underwent a sharp move up, and over the next two weeks it zoomed toward the all-important $100k level that it has failed to break out of despite breaching it multiple times in the past few days alone. SA Meanwhile, BTCW was doing a parallel dance of its own. Over the period since its inception on January 11, 2024, the fund managed to give investors superior returns over most other Bitcoin spot ETFs such as the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ), the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF ( BITB ), the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ), and the VanEck Bitcoin ETF ( HODL ). The only ETF that outperformed BTCW is the much older and larger Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ). SA Now for the Bad News: Issues with BTCW Until now, this looks like a solid play on BTC-USD. The comparably lower return (compared to a direct BTC-USD holding) could theoretically have been attributed to the 0.25% expense ratio - which is incidentally among the lowest ERs for Bitcoin spot ETFs (GBTC charges 1.50%) - but it just so happens that the sponsor fee was officially waived until July 11, 2024. The waiver was renewed since then (see quote below), and the sponsor waived another $5,700 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. So, that doesn't explain why the fund has underperformed the benchmark by nearly 10 percentage points. Another possible explanation could be distributions, but that doesn't apply here because BTCW doesn't pay a dividend. The objective of the fund is purely focused on capital appreciation. If there were a capital gains return via distributions, it would explain the difference. Yet another hypothetical explanation for BTCW's underperformance might have been realized losses on options contracts. However, that's ruled out as well since the ETF doesn't currently offer options trading. The custody fees that WisdomTree needs to pay its Bitcoin Custodian, Coinbase Custody Trust Company LLC, is another possible explanation for the underperformance. These fees aren't as transparent as I'd like , and they could, theoretically, account for at least a portion of the underperformance. One other aspect that's not quite transparent is the sponsor fee. Although this has been waived until July 11, 2025 , with an auto-renewal clause covering subsequent years, that's not the only fee; it's merely the recurring fee. Other, non-recurring fees are listed as : ""including but not limited to, taxes and governmental charges, any applicable brokerage commissions, financing charges or fees, bitcoin network fees and similar transaction fees, expenses and costs of any extraordinary services performed by the Sponsor (or any other service provider) on behalf of the Trust to protect the Trust or the interests of Shareholders (including, for example, in connection with any fork of the bitcoin blockchain), any indemnification of the Cash Custodian, Bitcoin Custodian, Trust Administrator or other agents, service providers or counterparties of the Trust and extraordinary legal fees and expenses, including any legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with litigation, regulatory enforcement or investigation matters."" That could explain, in part, the apparent NAV erosion, and if we dig into the numbers in their quarterly report for the period ended September 30, 2024, we see that net expenses - after the total sponsor fee waiver of $75,748 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 - were $93,856, all of which was incurred in Q3. 10-Q Report for Q3 However, that was offset by realized and unrealized gains on the trust's Bitcoin investments; remember, any expenses and liabilities over and above the waived sponsor fee can only be covered by selling Bitcoin. That offset allowed the fund to report a net asset increase of $18.4 million for the nine-month period. 10-Q Report for Q3 If not for those additional expenses (and, more importantly, the fee waiver), the ETF would have performed even worse against BTC-USD. I suspect that's the reason the waiver was extended, which means the sponsor is absorbing at least some of the NAV loss that the ETF incurred over the past eight months since inception. Closing Thoughts and My Recommendation for BTCW To me, that's not an optimal investment strategy. Honestly, it makes more sense to hold BTC-USD directly rather than to invest in a fund that piggybacks on BTC price action without tracking it accurately, and worse, one that would significantly underperform the cryptocurrency it tracks should there be a reversal in momentum. SA For Q4, we shouldn't be seeing that same issue because of how strongly BTC has moved between October 1 and now, but those expenses and liabilities will still continue to create a drag on NAV growth, which, in turn, impacts the market price of BTCW against a pureplay Bitcoin holding. That's validated by Q3's price performance. BTCW didn't report any share redemptions in that quarter, so it actually performed slightly better than BTC over that period despite the expense/liability load. SA Unfortunately, since the fund isn't even a year old at this time, we're unable to ascertain whether or not this underperformance due to expenses is an established pattern. As far as I can see, however, that's going to be the case moving forward. I'll reiterate here that this is the reason I suspect the continuation of the sponsor fee waiver is key to the fund's performance, which is not an ideal set up. As such, I'd recommend a Sell - take whatever profits you've made from BTCW off the table and invest directly in BTC-USD. Please consult with a qualified tax advisor on the best way to do this in a tax-advantaged account. I do realize that it sounds contrarian to have a Sell recommendation on an ETF with a +100% return since inception, but when you get into the nuts and bolts of it, as we did in this article, it's clear that this type of fund doesn't work well as a replacement for a direct Bitcoin holding. That's just my opinion, so please feel free to hold your BTCW position or even add to it based on your own assessment - of not only your Bitcoin price projections in 2025, but also of the way BTCW works.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4743464-btcw-not-compelling-investment-despite-sponsor-fee-waiver?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/37503912.jpeg

He has used cryptocurrency many times and built his own business empire in the industry. But how did he get the initial investment funds? In fact, he used the market value fluctuations to earn the price difference of cryptocurrency. If there were no cryptocurrency, how would he earn the price difference? Then we have to mention the projects he has invested in, that is, staking cryptocurrency and cloud mining. But how to stake without cryptocurrency? Then participate in cloud mining to get more cryptocurrency. What is Cloud Mining? To participate in cloud mining, you need to understand what cloud mining is. Cloud mining refers to the method of mining cryptocurrencies by renting cloud computing resources. Unlike traditional mining machines, users can rent computing power from the CrytocoinMiner platform (usually in the form of a lease contract), and the CrytocoinMiner platform that provides services will operate the mining machine in a remote data center. In the end, users will receive corresponding cryptocurrency rewards based on the proportion of computing power they rent, usually 1.2%-6%. Who are CrytocoinMiner? CrytocoinMiner is the world's top Bitcoin miner. It was founded in January 2018 and is headquartered in London, UK. It has more than 3.7 million members worldwide. Since its establishment, the company has been focusing on Bitcoin mining business. At present, the company not only has the world's most advanced Bitcoin mining technology, but also deploys the world's largest computing power facilities. According to statistics, the company contributes about 4.5% of the global hash rate. What kind of investors are suitable for CrytocoinMiner cloud mining? CrytocoinMiner cloud mining is favored by investors for its small investment, low risk, high returns and simple operation. Whether you have investment experience or not, you can easily get started and make money quickly. How much money do I need to invest to make money with CrytocoinMiner? 1. Register to make money, get $10 for free when registering, and get $0.5 in daily interest income by signing in every day. 2. Buy contracts to get higher returns. CrytocoinMiner has launched a variety of computing power contracts with a daily interest rate of up to 3%. 3. Choose a contract that suits your current financial ability and start making money. For example, the following contracts pay interest daily: Example: Invest $10,000 to purchase $10,000 worth of BTC [Advanced Computing Power], with a contract term of 50 days and a contract daily interest rate of 1.75%. The amount of passive income you can get every day after purchase = $10,000*1.75%=$175. After 50 days, your principal and income = $10,000+$175*50=$10,000+$8,750=$18,750 (Different contract computing power values, different investment amounts and terms, and different incomes, please log in to the CrytocoinMiner official website to view more contracts) Warm reminder: CrytocoinMiner's innovative business has been imitated by some companies since its launch, please be careful to identify.

Drawing comparisons to XRP’s explosive 5x rally, a seasoned investor highlights why these tokens, both trading under $0.50, could be hidden gems. With growing adoption, innovative use cases, and undervalued market positions, TRX and RXS are poised for a breakout. As excitement builds, many are wondering if now is the perfect time to act, before these altcoins potentially surge to new heights. Tron (TRX): A Bullish Surge with Promising Momentum Tron (TRX) has witnessed a sharp rally in the past month, surging by over 94% from $0.1637 to $0.3178, as shown in the chart. The price gained significant momentum due to growing adoption and market confidence in the ecosystem. TRX recently hit a peak of $0.40 before retracing to consolidate around $0.32, indicating healthy profit-taking and potential support at this level. The spike in 24-hour trading volumes earlier in the month, followed by a current 54% decline, suggests cooling activity but a strong long-term bullish sentiment. This aligns with the view that Tron’s momentum resembles the early stages of XRP’s recent rally. For investors eyeing undervalued opportunities, TRX’s technical setup signals potential for further growth. #Tron #TRX will explode in the next 48 hours. Price target $0.60.

37504105,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51897,1733919612,You Think RLUSD Will Send XRP to the Moon Immediately? You Need to Read This,"Vincent Van Code, a notable software engineer and cryptocurrency enthusiast, recently shared a detailed perspective on the potential impact of RLUSD (Regulatory-Linked USD) approval on XRP, the digital currency native to the XRP Ledger (XRPL). His analysis attracted comments from the crypto community, including critical responses from prominent validators. Van Code’s main argument centers around the idea that the RLUSD approval will lead to a transformative shift in demand for XRP. He began by acknowledging the recent speculative price increase, where XRP rose from $1.90 to $2.35 following the RLUSD announcement. However, he emphasizes that this price movement is primarily driven by market speculation rather than fundamental utility. People think #RLUSD is going to send #XRP to the moon immediately. Here is my take TLDR; 1. RLUSD approval has pumped the price up from 1.90 to 2.35 (at time of writing this) 2. This is purely a speculative pump and not one driven by fundamentals 3. The real pump will happen… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) December 10, 2024 Key Points from Van Code’s Analysis Current Price Movements Are Speculative: Van Code argues that the current price pump reflects excitement around RLUSD rather than tangible use cases. Future Utility-Driven Demand: He predicts that the “real pump” will occur once automated market makers (AMMs) and liquidity pools (LPs) are established on the XRPL . These setups, he claims, could enable users to earn around 5% annual percentage yield (APY) with minimal counterparty risk, potentially attracting significant capital inflows to the XRPL. Exchanges and RLUSD Staking: He anticipates that exchanges will offer RLUSD staking, locking XRP on the XRPL to generate returns. According to Van Code, this will contribute to XRP’s demand by reducing its circulating supply. Migration from USDT to RLUSD: Another key projection is that users may shift from holding USDT to RLUSD, transferring assets to self-custody wallets. RLUSD could then facilitate purchases of XRP, liquidity pool tokens, and other assets on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) operating within the XRPL ecosystem. Challenges for Market Makers: Van Code concludes that these factors could lead to significant demand for XRP, overwhelming market makers, and price suppression bots, potentially causing a notable price surge by February 2024. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Critical Response from XRPL Validator VET VET, an XRPL validator, offered a critical response to Van Code’s optimistic analysis, raising several concerns about the practicality of his claims. He highlighted that RLUSD cannot currently be utilized in automated market makers (AMMs) and pointed out the lack of guaranteed yields from liquidity pools involving RLUSD. Additionally, he emphasized the inherent risks of impermanent loss associated with AMMs, making them an unpredictable source of income for liquidity providers. VET also challenged the assertion of “zero counterparty risk” in AMM pools, arguing that this claim is inaccurate despite RLUSD’s stringent regulatory approval. Furthermore, he noted that traditional staking does not exist on the XRPL and that staking through exchanges introduces counterparty risks, undermining the notion of risk-free returns. Van Code’s Acknowledgment In response to VET’s critique, Van Code conceded certain inaccuracies in his original post. He clarified that RLUSD presents “low counterparty risk” rather than “zero counterparty risk,” admitting the timeline dependencies tied to AMM clawback features. While acknowledging the risks associated with AMMs and impermanent loss, he maintained that some users would prioritize long-term returns over potential capital gains. The exchange between Van Code and VET highlights the complexity of assessing the long-term impact of RLUSD on the XRPL ecosystem. While Van Code envisions RLUSD as a catalyst for substantial demand and price growth for XRP, VET’s critique underscores the practical and technical challenges that could temper such optimism.

President Milei has also expressed his desire to make his country a central hub for artificial intelligence. On his official X account, Tesla CEO Elon Musk expressed his delight at Argentina’s economic stabilization one year after President Javier Milei took office. Musk and President-elect Donald Trump had high expectations for the country’s leader, as this was the first time a self-described “anarcho-capitalist” had been elected to the country’s highest office. Wow, congratulations @JMilei 🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷 https://t.co/XtuVMZnfAt — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 11, 2024 Musk has publicly supported President Milei since he was elected. He also revealed that his companies, Tesla and Space X, were exploring ways to invest in Argentina. According to a CNBC report , the Argentine President became the first foreign leader to visit U.S. President-elect Donald Trump following his second-term election victory. Milei attended a November gala dinner at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, where he served as a VIP speaker. During the event, Milei praised Trump’s re-election, describing it as “the greatest political comeback in all of history” and commending Trump for defying the political establishment despite personal risks. He reportedly remarked that Trump’s victory marked a positive shift for global freedom. Milei also acknowledged Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who was in attendance, applauding Musk’s contributions to humanity. Speaking through an interpreter, he credited Musk for his efforts to “save humanity.” Argentina’s economy improves under Milei Argentina’s economy has undergone a dramatic turnaround under President Javier Milei, whose swift actions to balance the budget have reshaped the nation’s financial outlook. Inheriting a 5% GDP deficit, Milei achieved a financial surplus in the first quarter of his term and has maintained this trajectory. The country has experienced budget deficits in 113 of the past 123 years. While spending cuts primarily targeting pensioners and public employees have sparked debate over their long-term sustainability, the speed of fiscal stabilization stands as Milei’s most notable achievement. In a recent press briefing, Milei said that in 2023, a member of the previous administration he termed a “degenerate” printed 13% of GDP to win an election, which heightened inflation rates. According to the president’s recent press statements, the abrupt end to money printing has bolstered the Argentine peso, reversing years of depreciation. Inflation, which soared to a world-leading 211% in 2023, has also plummeted. Monthly inflation rates dropped from 25% last December to 2.7% in October, the lowest figure since late 2021, marking a significant step toward economic stability. Rent decontrol policies have nearly tripled the supply of apartments while reducing real prices by up to 40%. Additionally, the introduction of new satellite internet providers is expected to revolutionize agriculture by facilitating greater technological adoption. Milei’s policies have inspired Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, co-heads of the US government spending control authority Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), who stated that they would use Argentina’s model to minimize the USA’s federal budget . Argentine government vows to make the country an AI powerhouse President Javier Milei is determined to transform Argentina into a major player in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector despite the country’s current position as one of the least advanced in AI adoption on the continent. Milei sees his nation’s abundant, low-cost electricity and its highly skilled workforce as key assets in achieving this ambitious goal. “ We have everything, everything, to become an AI powerhouse ,” Milei stated, emphasizing the country’s potential to develop a thriving AI industry. He highlighted Argentina’s capacity to meet the energy demands of data centers, which are crucial for AI development, pointing to the country’s reliable energy infrastructure. Milei also echoed the importance of cold weather for data centers to function efficiently, suggesting that Argentina’s southern regions, with their vast land and cooler climate, could provide an ideal environment for this type of high-energy infrastructure. During recent trips to the U.S., Milei met with high-profile tech leaders such as Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk, presenting Argentina as “practically the last truly liberal country in the world.” According to Alexander Ditzend, president of Argentina’s AI Society, these meetings were part of Milei’s efforts to attract global investors to the country’s emerging AI sector.

Developed by the CryptoCurrency Certification Consortium (C4), this certification represents a new benchmark in cryptocurrency platform security. This accomplishment places WhiteBIT among the top-tier platforms recognized for superior security. The CCSS is an industry-standard security framework designed to ensure robust protection for cryptocurrency systems. It complements existing ICT security frameworks like ISO 27001 and PCI DSS by introducing specific guidance for best practices in securing cryptocurrencies. The standard includes three levels of certification, with Level 3 representing the highest benchmark, requiring advanced security measures such as multi-signature wallets, access controls, disaster recovery planning, as well as rigorous penetration testing and detailed audit trails for sensitive processes like data sensitization policies. WhiteBIT ’s successful certification was conducted by Hacken, a leading cybersecurity firm accredited by C4 to audit organizations for CCSS compliance. The auditor carried out an extensive review of WhiteBIT’s security infrastructure, following 3 years of preparation. The 2.5-month audit included in-depth inspections of both cold and hot wallets, dozens of hours of interviews with WhiteBIT personnel, and the submission of over 100 artifacts detailing the exchange’s policies, procedures, and security protocols. The final 97-page report reflected rigorous testing and hundreds of questions addressed throughout the process, ensuring full compliance with the stringent requirements of CCSS Level 3. ""This certification is a proof of our strong commitment to safeguarding our users' assets,"" says Volodymyr Nosov, Owner and CEO of WhiteBIT. ""In an industry where trust must be earned every day, we have embraced rigorous security protocols that set new benchmarks for excellence. Our goal isn’t just to drive innovation but to ensure that these advancements are built on a secure foundation. The CCSS certification underscores our dedication to providing a safer experience for our global user base of over 5,5 million."" WhiteBIT’s CCSS certification delivers significant benefits to users: Enhanced Security. CCSS ensures robust protections for user funds and private keys, minimizing risks of hacks or theft through advanced technologies like multisignature wallets. Reduced Risks. The standard mitigates human errors and ensures only authorized personnel can access sensitive systems, safeguarding user assets. Emergency Preparedness. WhiteBIT has recovery systems in place to protect user assets during unforeseen events, providing a safer trading experience. For WhiteBIT, this accomplishment aligns with its overarching strategy of promoting mass adoption through trust and transparency. Earlier this year, the company also achieved prominence by securing the highest level of PCI DSS certification for payment data protection—a further indication of its dedication towards comprehensive protection measures. About WhiteBIT WhiteBIT is one of the largest European centralized crypto exchanges founded in 2018. The exchange offers 600+ trading pairs, 300+ digital assets, and 9 state currencies. The company is an official partner of FC Barcelona, FC Trabzonspor, ESL Faceit, and VISA. The goal of WhiteBIT is the mass implementation of blockchain technology worldwide.

37503272,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=374300,1733919022,"Ray Dalio Says to Invest in BTC and Gold, Not Debt Assets: Report","Ray Dalio, an American investor and founder of the world’s largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, says he is investing in bitcoin (BTC) and gold rather than debt assets. The billionaire, who now serves as Bridgewater Associates’ investment chief, is more interested in the precious metal and cryptocurrency because they are “hard money.” On the other hand, debt assets like bonds are to be avoided because major economies are bound to face debt crises in the coming years, leading to a decline in their value. BTC and Gold Over Debt Assets According to a report from the South China Morning Post, Dalio dropped his remarks on BTC and gold during a speech on December 10 at the Abu Dhabi Finance Week (ADFW). He stated that all major economies, including the United States, China, and, excluding Germany, are seeing their indebtedness surge to unprecedented levels. Unfortunately, these levels are unsustainable, and there could be a debt money problem in the future. “I believe that there would likely be a pending debt money problem. I want to steer away from debt assets like bonds and debt and have some hard money like gold and bitcoin,” Dalio said. The billionaire further explained that debt, money, the economy, acts of nature, and the invention of new technologies are the forces driving everything in the world. Other factors, such as countries’ political and external geopolitical orders, could contribute significantly. Judging by Dalio’s preference for BTC and gold, he believes these assets are the best for preserving wealth as the world reacts to these forces. “Don’t get too caught up on the twists and turns of the day-to-day headlines, and instead, think more about the big forces. Think strategically as well as tactically, taking a global perspective while recognizing that what you don’t know about the future is more than what you do know,” the Bridgewater founder added. BTC Exceeds Dalio’s Expectations Dalio used to be a Bitcoin critic a few years ago. In 2020, he opined that the crypto asset is unlikely to perform as remarkably as people hoped. Bitcoin was worth around $15,000 at the time. Four years later, Dalio has become a Bitcoin advocate and now considers the cryptocurrency a better option than debt assets, especially with BTC crossing $100,000 for the first time.

At the recent Bitcoin Conference in Abu Dhabi, Trump remarked that the current banking system is quite ‘antiquated.’ If you want a loan for your dream house, it’ll take at least 90 days. But by then, your dream house might be sold. However, blockchain can solve this issue with its faster, more efficient process. He also added that blockchain can do everything that a traditional banking system can, only faster, better, and at a cheaper price. Trump’s Stance On Cryptocurrency It looks like Eric Trump shares his father’s vision. From the beginning of his re-election campaign, Donald Trump has been quite vocal about his support for crypto. He accepted donations for his campaign in crypto, appeared at several industry events, pledged to promote the crypto industry with fair regulations, and promised to make the USA ‘the crypto capital of the planet.’ That’s because he believes that crypto is the future of the world. Slowly but surely, every country will embrace this new currency, so it’s better that the USA leads the revolution. ‘If crypto is going to define the future, I want it to be mined, minted, and made in the USA,’ he had said. The Impact of Trump’s Crypto-friendly Approach on the Overall Market Crypto investors might have noticed that over the last few weeks, the market has been on the rise. Many popular currencies, such as Bitcoin and Dogecoin, and a few new entries on presale, like Flockerz , have been gaining ground at rocket speed. Bitcoin recently crossed the $100K valuation mark. The spike started on November 6 when it seemed Trump would win the election. In a single day, Bitcoin’s value jumped up by $6K. A week later, its total value hit $90K; on December 5, Bitcoin crossed $100K . The same happened with Dogecoin. After Trump’s victory, its per-token price more than doubled, going from $0.16 per token to almost $0.38. Today (December 11), it’s listed at just over $0.39. It’s having one of the best years since 2021. Flockerz, which is currently in presale, has managed to raise $4M so far. According to experts, when the token finally launches, the big investors might become millionaires overnight as they expect it to give a 4000x return. Chasing the (New) American Dream Analysts believe Trump’s victory in the presidential election is one of the reasons for this sudden growth. Trump has promised to reduce restrictions on crypto trading, lower taxes, create favorable policies, and even appoint a crypto-friendly chairperson to the SEC. This has given new investors the much-needed confidence to finally dip their toes in the market. Seasoned investors are also looking to increase their investments. However, bear in mind that this isn’t financial or investment advice and it’s critical you do your own research before investing. So if the market does continue to grow at this pace, Trump’s prediction will come true – crypto will become the future and overtake traditional baking systems.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-outpace-banking-flock-token-surges-past-5-5-m/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/37503124.jpeg

The Bitcoin trendline is holding, and so is the $95,000 horizontal support. How far can this bounce go? Two flash crashes in succession wipe out leverage The last crypto flash crash is still very much in the minds of many, and certainly in the minds of those who were liquidated , as Bitcoin fell heavily once again on Monday and Tuesday. It also needs to be borne in mind that the huge $12,000 BTC crash from top to bottom was only a week ago. If these two crashes did anything, they certainly cleared out most of the leverage in the system, giving the market a clean slate with which to go forward. Strong buying continues With Bitcoin now looking to be fully embarked on its recovery, the impact from the huge MicroStrategy buy of $2.1 billion in BTC could now be permeating through the market. That the U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs bought a further 4.51K BTC on Tuesday should also help. Can Willow quantum computing chip threaten Bitcoin? The introduction by Google of their Willow quantum computing chip perhaps brings some slight nervousness to the market. This chip of 105 qubits has been demonstrated to solve tasks in minutes that supercomputers would take a huge amount of time to complete. That said, while this is another big step forward in quantum computing, a chip with the amount of qubits required to break the encryption of Bitcoin must still be quite a way off. Estimates as to the amount of qubits needed for this would be in the millions, or even billions of qubits. Major support holds for $BTC Source: TradingView The 4-hour chart for $BTC displays how the price is still continuing to respect the ascending trendline, and the candle wicks below are testament to the strong buying coming into Bitcoin when any sign of trouble appears. The $BTC price has entered resistance now, but it is likely that the bulls will try to push the price up and through the 0.618 Fibonacci at $99,000. Above this is the 0.786 Fibonacci at a price of $101,000. If the bulls can force the price up through these levels it could be game-on again. $BTC triangle breakout? Source: TradingView Looking a bit further out into the 12-hour time frame, it can be observed that the $BTC price could be bouncing within a triangle pattern. If the price can continue to the top of the triangle, and the Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart would point to this being a distinct possibility, a breakout would have a measured move to around $111,000.

This comes as the Ripple community reacts positively to news that the Ripple USD (RLUSD) stablecoin is about to launch. Meanwhile, Dogecoin, which is above a key support area, and new crypto token iDEGEN are attracting investors. Will XRP get a RLUSD boost? XRP price reached highs of $2.82 on Dec. 3 before paring gains alongside other top altcoins. The profit taking came as the Ripple cryptocurrency neared the $3 mark for the first time since 2018. While the XRP value fell to under $2 earlier this week, it has bounced higher to trade above $2.34 at the time of writing. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced on Tuesday that the company’s stablecoin project RLUSD has received final regulatory approval.

According to analysts, RLUSD has the potential to be a major catalyst for XRP adoption. An end to SEC lawsuit and Ripple’s massive network of partnerships could also be at the heart of this possibility. XRP has a 24-hour range of $1.94 – $2.39 and seven day range of $1.98 – $2.64. If bulls charge amid a fresh leg up, a breakout above $3 is likely to bring a new all-time high above the current ATH of $3.40 reached in January 2018. According to on-chain data, whales have recently acquired 100 million XRP . However, this pales in comparison to the staggering 2.66 billion XRP sent to Binance as price corrected this past week. Can Dogecoin reach $1 after its recent surge? Dogecoin (DOGE) is the largest meme coin by market cap and saw a decent uptick as Bitcoin stormed to above $100k. The strong community, combined with its attractiveness as the original and most resilient meme coin continue to offer bulls the basis for long term bets. The DOGE price reached highs of $0.48 before the broader pullback pushed it to under $0.38. While buyers have yet to regain a strong footing, it’s out of the overbought territory. The meme coin’s price on the daily chart has the Relative Strength Index at 51. In recent weeks, that stood at 92. However, the RSI is signaling a potential upward flip. DOGE’s main bull cycle target is $1. Dogecoin price is up 73% in the past week and 346% year-to-date. iDEGEN attracts as AI agents get traction DWF Labs managing partner Andrei Grachev recently noted that autonomous AI agents have the potential to spark new economic opportunities. His remarks came as the market maker announced a $20 million fund to power development of AI agents. As the AI agent sector flourishes, iDEGEN stands out among the crowd for its unique design. This is an AI agent that is degen raised – there are no barriers to what it can learn or post. Everything it posts after every 60 minutes is what it learns from the degen community on X. It means iDEGEN has the potential to thrive in the absolute chaos of Crypto Twitter and AI – raising itself above agentic projects with guardrails. The unique approach has crypto enthusiasts flocking to the native token IDGN’s pre-market auction. Data on the presale page shows the total raised so far has hit $4 million and over 850 million tokens sold. Notably, interest in this crypto project is spiking as investors eye the next Goateus Maximus (GOAT). To position, early birds are taking advantage of the dynamic pricing model. Every five minutes, IDGN price can increase, remain unchanged or decline. Currently, the token is priced at $0.00255, up from the initial $0.00011. Could IDGN price go parabolic as GOAT did?

37503066,https://crypto.news/?p=14317688,1733918580,NFTs’ role in the preservation and reinterpretation of art | Opinion,"Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. In recent years, non-fungible tokens have sparked a lively debate in both the art world and broader cultural discussions. From their role in high-value digital art sales to their perceived association with speculative bubbles, NFTs are often viewed through a polarized lens. You might also like: Museums, AI-generated art, blockchain, and NFTs | Opinion Yet, beneath the buzz and controversy lies a transformative technology that revolutionizes how we preserve, authenticate, and engage with art and culture. NFTs provide a tamper-proof ledger that ensures trust, transparency, and the preservation of cultural heritage—fundamental components for understanding art’s true value. Importance of authenticity and provenance Authenticity is the cornerstone of art valuation. For example, a painting attributed to Leonardo da Vinci could fetch hundreds of millions of dollars, whereas the price of a copy from his contemporary could drop by more than 99%. However, a reproduction of the original in today would not be considered as art in the same way. This stark difference in value lies in the authenticity of the work. Provenance, while perhaps less familiar to those outside the art world, is just as crucial. It refers to the documented history of an artwork, tracing its journey from creation through various owners to its present-day status. When an artwork’s provenance includes renowned collectors or dealers, it confirms an artwork’s authenticity and adds historical context and significance, further enhancing its value. Traditionally, authenticity and provenance have relied on physical records such as catalogues, inventories, or certificates, all of which are vulnerable to loss, damage, or manipulation. These gaps in historical documentation can make it challenging to assess an artefact’s true value. NFTs provide a solution by creating immutable records, ensuring the preservation of critical information, and offering a transparent and secure way to track provenance. Tokenization: A new path for art? Despite the potential of NFTs in documentation and preservation, many traditional methods of publication, digitization, archiving, and database management remain in place. Experts in the field of art and culture have not yet felt the need to integrate NFTs into these established practices. However, the most common and tangible application of NFTs in the art world today is tokenization. This involves creating digital versions of artworks certified by respected institutions. For instance, in 2021, the British Museum issued over 200 NFTs of 19th-century drawings by Japanese artist Hokusai, and the Belvedere Museum in Vienna turned Gustav Klimt’s The Kiss into 10,000 NFTs in the following year. Such initiatives offer the public an innovative way to engage with cultural treasures. Instead of purchasing a postcard or souvenir at the end of a museum visit, visitors can now buy a piece of digital history that connects them to iconic works of art. This not only fosters deeper connections with cultural artefacts but also helps fund the preservation and conservation of the physical artworks through proceeds from the sale of these digital versions. Private collectors have also embraced tokenization, often with investment goals in mind, offering fractional ownership of artworks through NFTs as digital proofs of shares. However, this approach raises fundamental questions about the relationship between the physical artwork and its digital counterpart. For instance, if you own an NFT share of an artwork, what rights does this confer? Can you display the artwork physically or digitally? When will the market infrastructure mature enough to support the trading of these digital shares effectively? Even in museum-led initiatives, how does an NFT’s value and significance compare to a freely available high-resolution photo of the artwork? These questions directly impact the perceived value and liquidity of such NFTs, whether they are treated as digital derivatives or as representations of tangible ownership. Although tokenization offers many benefits in terms of education, engagement, and raising awareness, the digital representations of art will likely remain secondary to their physical originals. In the long term, the true value of art lies in its physical presence, and preservation efforts must continue to focus on ensuring the material integrity of cultural artefacts. Museums, collectors, and cultural institutions will still need to invest in the protection and conservation of these objects in controlled environments, using a range of technologies beyond NFTs. NFTs: The future of cultural preservation and reinterpretation So, what is the best application of NFTs in preserving historical art and culture? Artworks are manifestations of human creativity and cultural identity, and their preservation can take two complementary paths. One is to safeguard the physical artefacts created by those who came before us, ensuring that they remain intact and accessible for future generations. The other path is to capture the essence of these works, reinterpreting them in innovative ways that blend creativity with technology, bringing art and culture into the future. NFTs offer a unique opportunity to bridge these two paths. They not only document and digitize historical artefacts but also enable artists to reimagine cultural heritage in novel forms. By leveraging technology, we ensure that the stories of our past resonate with audiences of the future. An example of NFTs being used meaningfully and respectfully for cultural preservation is Refik Anadol’s collaboration with the Yawanawá people of Brazil—composed of a central video artwork and a collection of 1,000 unique and dynamically evolving NFT data paintings. The project Winds of Yawanawá blends artworks created by local people, Amazon rainforest data, AI technology, and immersive digital displays to create a data-driven art experience. This project not only celebrates Indigenous heritage but also raises awareness about the ecological importance of the Amazon, generating funds to support both cultural and environmental conservation. Such projects set a precedent for how NFTs can be used not only as static tokens of ownership but as dynamic platforms for storytelling, advocacy, and cultural preservation. By combining traditional art forms with environmental and technological data, NFTs can create immersive, educational experiences that amplify Indigenous voices and foster cultural pride. Embracing the future of art & culture For now, contemporary artists are the primary beneficiaries of NFT technology. NFTs can document provenance and verify authenticity from the moment of creation, providing future collectors with confidence in the artwork’s origins. Moreover, NFTs can serve as comprehensive digital archives, capturing details about sponsors, editions, exhibition histories, and transparent pricing. We must remember that we are constantly creating history. The art of today will become the “ancient art” of tomorrow. Culture is a continuum, and our relationship with time and its impact on art is inherently fluid. By embracing NFTs, we ensure that today’s artistic narratives will be preserved for future generations. I believe that everything begins in the mind. As humans, we generate ideas and transform them into physical objects, attaching meanings and interpretations to them. In today’s digital age, we are increasingly valuing intangible assets like digital experiences and virtual spaces. Rather than simply replicating physical objects digitally, we should continue to tap into our creativity to craft new forms and experiences that will define the future. This is how art and culture evolve, adapting to the times while maintaining the essence of human expression.

Raydium dominates Solana’s DEX market, with over 60% of daily trading volume. Memecoin surge drives Raydium’s growth, making up 65% of its daily volume. Solana recently made headlines by hitting a key 50% retracement level, a pattern that many market makers consider a reliable trading indicator. This technical development highlights the consistency of Solana’s price action. The Solana ecosystem, particularly its decentralized exchange (DEX), Raydium, is growing rapidly. For two consecutive months, Raydium has surpassed Uniswap in monthly trading volume, marking a shift in decentralized finance (DeFi). Raydium’s Dominance in the DEX Market Raydium , the largest automated market maker (AMM) DEX on Solana, has played a key role in the Solana network’s rise. Launched in 2021, the platform allows users to create liquidity pools, provide liquidity, and swap tokens. Users can earn fees through trading activities, while Raydium’s native token, RAY, adds an incentive layer.

37503025,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=660591,1733918448,Solana Will ‘Step Back Into The Spotlight’ Once It Reclaims $222 – Details,"Solana has faced a sharp 23% correction since reaching new all-time highs nearly three weeks ago. This pullback, though significant, reflects broader market conditions as Bitcoin and altcoins enter a phase of indecision. The market is currently searching for support and consolidating below critical levels, with investors closely monitoring whether this phase will lead to recovery or further downside. Related Reading: Cardano Follows 2020 Bullish Pattern – Top Analyst Plans To Take Profits Between $4 And $6 Top analyst Jelle recently shared a technical analysis on X, suggesting that Solana holds promising upside potential. According to Jelle, if Solana can reclaim the $222 level in the coming days, it will likely trigger a quick and substantial surge. This key price point is a critical threshold that could shift sentiment and reignite bullish momentum for the popular altcoin. While the broader market remains uncertain, Solana’s ability to recover and build momentum above $222 could set the stage for a decisive breakout. However, failure to reclaim this level could prolong its consolidation or lead to further retracement. Solana remains a closely watched asset, with retail and institutional investors waiting for clearer signals on its next direction. Will it recover its bullish trajectory or face continued selling pressure? The coming days are likely to provide answers. Solana Finding Support In Previous Resistance Solana has retraced to test crucial liquidity levels between $200 and $210, an area that previously acted as resistance but is now being evaluated as support. This zone holds significant importance for SOL’s price action, as it could determine whether the asset continues its bullish momentum or faces further consolidation. Related Reading: Dogecoin Pressing Range Highs – Can Bulls Push DOGE To ATH? Solana’s price action is in a consolidation phase with no definitive direction, but the signs of a potential breakout are becoming clearer. The asset appears poised to make a decisive move, particularly if it reclaims key levels in the coming sessions. Analyst Jelle recently shared insights on X, emphasizing the critical importance of the $222 level. Jelle noted, “Reclaim $222, and SOL quickly steps back into the spotlight. Deviate those lows and send it higher.” This suggests that if Solana successfully reclaims this key level, it could re-enter price discovery, triggering a massive breakout and attracting renewed attention from retail and institutional investors. Should Solana achieve this, it may set the stage for a rally that mirrors its earlier impressive performance, reaffirming its position as one of the top-performing altcoins in the market. Conversely, failure to hold the $200-$210 support range could lead to further consolidation or a deeper correction. Solana remains a focal point in the market, with investors eagerly awaiting its next move. SOL Testing Crucial Demand Solana (SOL) is trading at $220, showing resilience after tagging the $203 level twice in the past week. This area has proven to be a strong support zone, as buyers stepped in to prevent further declines. The price now hovers near a critical juncture, with market participants closely watching for the next major move. If SOL can hold above the $203 support and reclaim the $238 resistance area, a quick recovery could follow, potentially paving the way for a renewed bullish trend. Reclaiming $238 would signal strength and attract fresh buying interest, pushing SOL back into higher trading ranges. However, this recovery may take time as the broader crypto market consolidates in indecision. Bitcoin and other major altcoins also move sideways, adding to the uncertainty around Solana’s immediate price action. Until a breakout or breakdown occurs, SOL is likely to remain range-bound. Related Reading: PEPE Whales Increased Their Holdings By $1.4 Billion Yesterday – Details Traders and investors should monitor these key levels closely. A sustained break above $238 could reignite bullish momentum, while failure to hold the $203 support may lead to a deeper correction.

42389864,851dea73-8c6b-44a5-9003-bc121cc9a86b,1733918400,"Crypto Daybook Americas: Inflation May Just Provide a Santa Spark for Bitcoin, Others","By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)  If you're waiting for a spark to ignite a Santa rally in bitcoin and the wider crypto market, today's U.S. inflation release might just be it.  Initially, I wasn't sure the report matters anymore. Obsessing over prices feels so 2022, when inflation was through the roof and the Fed squarely focused on interest-rate hikes to tame the beast. Recently, though, CPI has been below 3% and the Fed has cut rates, focusing on balancing employment and price stability.  The November report is expected to show a slight uptick in price pressures and there are two reasons to keep an eye on it. Firstly, BTC bulls and bears are having a showdown near the all-important $100,000 level and might look to fundamental/macro news to reassert themselves. A softer-than-expected inflation print will likely validate Fed rate cut bets, potentially strengthening the bull grip for a sustained move above $100K. ETH might see bigger gains, having experienced a classic ""throwback,"" or a bullish retest of a breakout point, near $3,600 in the last 24 hours.  But if the data comes in hotter than estimated, especially the core figure, it could add to the dollar's bull momentum and energize bitcoin bears, who have an advantage heading into the data release. Data shared by Hyblock Capital overnight showed a 50% order-book imbalance, with more limit sells than buys. Cardano's ADA is also feeling the pinch, with slippage spikes hinting at worsening liquidity.  The second reason is that the U.S. Treasury market has been a picture of calm recently, with its volatility gauge, MOVE, plunging to 85 from 136. So, what better than CPI to stir it up again, sending ripples across financial markets. Let's see how it goes. Bank of America said it expects the report to breed equity market volatility.  Looking past inflation, I want to reiterate the importance of watching the Far-East. Reuters reports that China could allow the yuan to depreciate next year in response to President-elect Donald Trump's proposed tariffs. While that may drive Chinese investors toward crypto, as the popular narrative says, a rapid decline might force the PBOC to intervene, inadvertently strengthening the dollar and tightening global financial conditions. That's typically not great news for risk assets like BTC.  Elsewhere, Bloomberg's observers said that Nasdaq might add MicroStrategy (MSTR) to its index, which might inject $2.1 billion of buying demand into the stock. MSTR has been literally borrowing dollars to buy BTC, becoming a leveraged bet on the cryptocurrency. But remember, leverage works both ways; what goes up faster can also come down harder.  That's plenty of macros to chew on today. Stay alert!  What to Watch  Crypto:  Dec. 13: The annual Nasdaq-100 reconstitution. Changes to the index, if any, are announced on this day.

Memecoin trading propelled Solana-based Raydium to top the decentralized exchange (DEX) rankings by volume for the second straight month in November, eclipsing long-time leader Uniswap with $124.6 billion in volume versus $90.5 billion.  Raydium captured over 60% of the daily total DEX volume last month. A significant portion, peaking at 65%, came from trading in memecoins, according to a Messari report released Tuesday.  This growth mirrors a larger shift in the market, with Solana's daily DEX volume overtaking Ethereum's. In November, Solana commanded nearly 50% of the DEX activity across all blockchains; Ethereum captured 18%.  Memecoins on Solana are known for their high volatility, attracting traders looking for quick gains, and their speculative nature has led to significant trading volumes. For more on memecoins and Solana, check out the profile of Ansem, the  Memecoin King, in CoinDesk's Most Influential 2024.  The latest trend is AI agents, or meme tokens that claim to use AI for products such as financial research or music creation. Tokens like AI16Z and ZEREBRO have run to market caps in excess of $300 million from under under $10,000 in a few weeks.  Memecoins often start trading on Raydium after hitting market cap thresholds on launch platforms like Pump.fun — the most-used token issuance platform and another of CoinDesk's most influential — giving it a stream of new tokens every day.  Such activity has minted Raydium developers' revenue of over $25 million since October, more than $500 million since January. That's 10 times the $44 million the DEX made in 2023, DefLLama data shows.  A few people are probably wishing the frenzy never ends.  Derivatives Positioning  Perpetual funding rates in small-cap tokens, often considered a proxy for speculative frenzy, are no longer overheated and have normalized to levels seen in bitcoin and ether.   BTC options flows continue to lean bullish, with notable activity in calls at the $130,000 and $150,000 strikes expiring in February and March, respectively.  Strong uptake has been seen for ETH $3,300 put expiring Dec. 20 and $3,750 call expiring Dec. 13.  Friday expiry BTC and ETH puts are trading at a slight premium to calls, reflecting concern of short-term downside volatility.

During the meeting, HRH Prince Salman bin Hamad emphasized the Kingdom’s commitment to advancing the financial services and digital technology sectors, both of which are priorities that contribute to supporting the Kingdom’s comprehensive development under the leadership of His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa. He also reaffirmed the Kingdom of Bahrain’s commitment to attracting international companies across promising sectors, strengthening its regional and international position, and expanding growth across various industries. The Minister of Finance and National Economy, HE Shaikh Salman bin Khalifa Al Khalifa, and the Governor of Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB), HE Khalid Ebrahim Humaidan, also attended the meeting. Crypto.com secured licenses and partnerships to operate in the Kingdom In September 2024, Crypto.com received a payment service provider (PSP) license from the Central Bank of Bahrain through its subsidiary registered in the Kingdom under the commercial name “FORIS GFS BH B.S.C. CLOSED”. The PSP license allowed Crypto.com to expand its offerings of e-money and fiat-based payment services regionally, including the launch of its prepaid cards.

It is a principal license that allows Crypto.com to launch a card in Bahrain powered by Mastercard. The new program leverages Mastercard’s trusted, scalable and secure payments network to enable the crypto exchange’s customers to use their card at over 150 million in-store and online locations worldwide.

Experts are tracking a potential 32x price rally by early 2025. Along with its presale, Rexas hopes to bridge the gap between traditional assets and blockchain technology. Based on its recent accomplishments and strong growth trajectory, Rexas Finance may be seen as a robust candidate in the crypto landscape to rival already established tokens such as Cardano (ADA). Rexas Finance raises $20.75 million in presale Rexas Finance, which focuses on Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization, has hit it out of the park by raising $20.75 million in its eighth presale. The project allows investors to easily convert traditional assets to digital tokens to gain access to the possibilities within the blockchain ecosystem. Its presale currently costs $0.125, and the token will soon be listed on top-tier exchanges, making it a great investment. Experts predict Rexas could be a solid one of those altcoins that can enjoy immense growth in 2025, kickstarting the year with speedy growth in 2024. The project is viewed as a leader in space because it is ambitious enough to take over the RWA tokenization space. However, Rexas Finance has won investors’ trust as it has already been listed on platforms such as CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. In addition, Rexas is secure thanks to a rigorous audit by Certik. This lends confidence to those considering the presale route to allocate early to RXS tokens before the price skyrockets. Besides its strong presale performance, Rexas Finance is doing well because of a $1 million giveaway campaign. This aims to give early adopters chances to profit from the project’s growth. With the presale imminent, investors also hope the token will explode in late 2025. Currently trading at $0.125 with a price projection of $0.20, now is a great time for any buyer to purchase. Cardano whales signal strength amid market shifts While Rexas is rising, Cardano (ADA) is also making significant headlines as whales flooded the market with over 100 million ADA in just 24 hours. ADA holders show strength, while the Cardano ecosystem shows strength in the world’s stability despite wider market reversal. ADA has formed an ascending triangle pattern in the past month, indicating a possible breakout. As Cardano grows, it’s still a strong pick for long-term exposure to blockchain solutions. While Cardano’s fundamentals are still strong, the breakneck growth of projects like Rexas Finance suggests that investor demand is moving further to tokenization platforms with real uses. While RXS remains at the forefront as it continues to gain traction and funding, it will enter the tokenization space as a key player, competing with the likes of Cardano. Rexas represents a different way of adopting blockchain, and its future growth could offer huge returns to early investors, all set to become a rival to ADA by 2025.

On December 11, renowned crypto and on-chain analyst Ali Martinez revealed that XRP whales had purchased over 100 million tokens during the dip, demonstrating clear confidence in the asset’s long-term potential. “In the recent dip, whales bought over 100 million $XRP!” Martinez noted, highlighting how major investors stepped in just as retail traders were selling off.

Data from CryptoQuant also confirms that whales have moved 2.66 billion XRP to Binance in the past 30 days, with the surge in whale activity the largest since April 2024, when a similar volume of 2.8 billion XRP was transferred to exchanges. Exchange Flow (Whales) to Binance hit a 6-months high.

It suggests that major players are positioning themselves ahead of anticipated developments, such as a potential Ripple IPO and the launch of a Ripple-backed stablecoin. Catalysts driving XRP’s momentum Several factors are contributing to this surge in interest. XRP’s recent legal clarity—thanks to a landmark ruling that declared it not a security—has removed a significant regulatory cloud hanging over Ripple. Additionally, with the likelihood of a more crypto-friendly U.S. administration taking office, market optimism for assets like XRP is surging. While whale accumulation and favorable macro conditions paint a bullish picture, XRP’s price remains volatile. The token is currently trading above the critical $2.23 support level, with a psychological resistance level at $3 in sight, should XRP manage to break past $2.94.

For a long time, Tether has dominated the stablecoin sector in the crypto industry. In particular due to its high liquidity and exchanging volume, overperforming even Bitcoin ( BTC ) in this aspect. As of this writing, USDC has less than one-third of USDT’s capitalization, with $40.86 billion against $138.65 billion. The volume difference is even more impressive, with Tether’s stablecoin having $1.84 trillion exchanged in the last seven days and Circle’s token only $120.77 billion. Tether USDT and Circle USDC market capitalization and volume. Source: CoinMarketCap However, this is mostly due to USDT’s presence in centralized exchanges and corporate treasuries. USDC is already the most used stablecoin in the decentralized finance ( DeFi ) ecosystem and has a larger presence in blockchains. Therefore, if Circle manages to tackle and improve USDC’s presence in a place currently dominated by Tether, it is possible that USDC could challenge USDT’s throne as the leading stablecoin. Tether already holds more US treasury bonds than powerful economies like Germany, Australia, and the UAE. This evidences how challenging it will be for Circle to increase its market share despite having more regulatory clarity . In the meantime, decentralized stablecoin alternatives to both USDC and USDT are already surging and consolidating in the cryptocurrency space.

Citing historical data, analysts noted that when the Altcoin Seasonal Index crosses 60, Bitcoin tends to deliver positive returns in the following months. Analysts who are quite optimistic about Bitcoin added that the recent strong performance of altcoins points to a potential BTC rally. “The Altcoin Season Index measures the percentage of the top 50 cryptocurrencies that have outperformed Bitcoin over a 90-day period. A value above 60 indicates a historically strong altcoin season and is a bullish signal for BTC. As a result, Bitcoin generally drives up altcoin prices.

A proposal raised in the Legislative Council on Dec. 11 highlights the pressure on the government to keep up with the global rise in crypto investments. In a written response, Acting Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Joseph Chan, admitted that while the virtual assets sector offers financial innovation opportunities, it also presents new “complexities to the financial system.” He emphasized Hong Kong’s commitment to keep up with international standards, noting that the city “has key influence in the regulation and development of VA.” However, Chan didn’t go into detail on how or when Hong Kong plans to adjust its crypto regulations to stay competitive.

Over the past 24 hours, the OM token has increased by 3.08% and is approaching a market cap of $4 billion.Currently priced at $4.20, the Mantra token is gearing up for a possible all-time high. Will the bullish momentum push it past the $5 mark?Mantra Price AnalysisOn the daily chart, the Mantra price trend has exhibited a sideways shift after a massive bullish jump in mid-November. Between November 14 and 17, the price surged 204%, from $1.3891 to $4.2314. Mantra Price Chart Following the formation of four consecutive bullish candles, the OM price trend has shifted to a sideways pattern. On the 4-hour chart, this sideways movement creates a consolidation range between $3.45 and $4.23.A bullish reversal within this consolidation range is now challenging the overhead resistance. This ""glass ceiling"" coincides with the 23.60% trend-based Fibonacci level at $4.1934.With a rapid recovery in play, the chances of a bullish breakout for Mantra have significantly increased, especially with Bitcoin's minor recovery. The breakout is supported by a positive MACD crossover and improving market sentiment.Additionally, the simple moving average (SMA) lines on the 4-hour chart—50 and 100 SMAs—show a positive alignment, further supporting the bullish outlook.Will OM Token Reach $5?Using trend-based Fibonacci levels, a breakout from the consolidation range could propel the altcoin toward a new all-time high. The 38.20% Fibonacci level at $4.6524 is a potential price target.However, the 50% Fibonacci level at the $5.00 psychological mark is a favorite among traders and investors.

The acquisition is part of Synthetix’s plan to create a decentralized liquidity layer and emerge as a leading product issuer within the ecosystem. “The acquisition of TLX will mark the first end-customer, revenue-generating product built on top of Synthetix that will be owned and operated by Synthetix.” TLX Acquisition to Expand Synthetix Offering In its announcement, Synthetix said the deal helps expand its offerings. Following an audit, Synthetix plans to optimize key parameters and redeploy the platform’s smart contracts on the Base network. Additionally, TLX’s native token will be burned and converted to Synthetix’s SNX token. To kick off 2025, Synthetix has promised an enticing incentive program for leveraged token users. The platform intends to use TLX’s codebase as a foundation for developing its own leveraged tokens. In turn, this will accelerate the timeline for bringing these products to market. “Leveraged tokens are just the first category of structured products that Synthetix will be launching over the coming months,” Synthetix wrote. “This suite of products will help broaden Synthetix’s capabilities and generate more value for SNX stakeholders over the long-term.” Founded in 2017 by Kain Warwick, Synthetix enables trading of synthetic assets like stocks, commodities, and currencies on Ethereum. With $242 million in total value locked, according to DeFiLlama, the protocol remains a key player in the DeFi landscape. Synthetix Eyes More Acquisitions Last month, Synthetix set its sights on acquiring Kwenta , a derivatives exchange that emerged from Synthetix itself in 2020. On October 29, the project published a proposal outlining the plans in the governance forums of both Synthetix and Kwenta. If approved, the exchange, recognized as the leading project within the Synthetix ecosystem by trade volume, will be rebranded as a new version of Synthetix Exchange. Additionally, Kwenta’s treasury will be integrated into the Synthetix treasury. The governance structure surrounding Kwenta will dissolve, transferring control to Synthetix’s Spartan Council. Synthetix would purchase the entire circulating supply of Kwenta, totaling 532,375 KWENTA tokens, for approximately 9.05 million newly minted SNX tokens (approx $13.2 million).

37501856,https://coinpedia.org/?p=391836,1733916223,Solana’s ETF Setback Looms but Can Cardano and Rollblock Defy the SEC’s Chill?,"The post Solana’s ETF Setback Looms but Can Cardano and Rollblock Defy the SEC’s Chill? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News One could be forgiven for thinking SEC chair Gary Gensler is now just being spiteful for the sake of it. After losing his reputation with the Ripple Labs XRP case, Genser was given his marching orders by incoming President Trump, and Gensler confirmed he would resign on inauguration day. The problem is that Gensler, as a last act of defiance, rejected Solana ETFs. This is a massive relief for ADA investors as Cardano whales will unlikely be lured to Solana just yet. However, Rollblock’s ongoing presale may be cause for excitement among even Cardano whales as this GambleFi token heats up. Rollblock (RBLK): A Whale’s Opportunity in the Making Rollblock isn’t just another token in the market —it’s a tour de force. Designed as a GambleFi platform, Rollblock blends the excitement of online gambling with the sustainability of decentralized finance. Unlike the fleeting hype of typical presale tokens, Rollblock offers tangible value through profit-sharing mechanisms, ensuring investors earn dividends weekly. With its deflationary model and community-driven governance, Rollblock positions itself as an asset built for longevity, not just speculation. For whales looking to diversify their portfolios or maximize returns, Rollblock’s steady rise and $7 million liquidity milestone suggest it’s a project worth exploring. In a market full of quick gains and even quicker losses, Rollblock promises not just potential but staying power—a rare find in today’s volatile landscape. Cardano (ADA): Cardano Whales Not Ready To Jump Ship Just Yet If you’re a Cardano whale, you are swimming in the balmy waters of insane profits. Cardano has made a comeback like those French poets write verses about. Regarded by many as yesterday’s news, Cardano probed the $0.25 mark a year ago, and its market cap was a shadow of what it once was. Yet, Cardano whales remained steadfast in their commitment to the token. These Cardano whales are having the last laugh, as Cardano is now trading at way over a dollar and has delivered nearly 250x on the 90-day candle. The question is, can Carano whales take some of the profit and re-invest it somewhere else? The way Rollblock is going, the answer may be yes. Solana (SOL): Solana Etfs Denied Their Moment In The Sun In what critics call a final act of defiance, outgoing SEC chair Gary Gensler indicated he would not approve Solana ETFs, citing concerns about Solana’s status as a security. The non-approval of Solana ETFs is arguably a non-event, as incoming SEC chair Paul Atkins is sure to rubber stamp Solana ETF approval as a matter of course. But will it make a difference? Neither the Bitcoin nor Ethereum ETFs have made much of an impact, with many investors asking why to hold an ETF when you can just hold the token. It’s a good point, but the Solana ETF will give legitimacy to the coin, and it could be a bona fide asset, and that can only be good for Solana. Conclusion Solana ETFs may have been shot down by Gensler, but it’s only a temporary setback before the new SEC chair pushes through the application, and this will lend legitimacy to Solana as an asset. Cardano whales, however, may be looking at other avenues to invest in. That opportunity may just be the Rollblock presale. Rollblock is now available at $0.041.

Solana has been criticized for its tokenomics but remains on a strong price trajectory heading into the year. Meanwhile, a new trading platform, Lunex Network ($LNEX), is attracting attention for its unprecedented level of trader privacy, efficiency and interoperability. So how will things pan out for these major players in the next quarter? Bitcoin (BTC) Slows As Long Term Holders Sell Up Bitcoin (BTC) jumped 124% this year but slowed in the last month, and despite dipping over the last 24 hours, Bitcoin has remained relatively flat over the previous five days. The wider growth of the crypto market means that Bitcoin’s increase this year actually represents a fairly underwhelming performance when compared to other big blockchains, which has caused some long-time Bitcoin (BTC) holders to sell up. Technically, no major technological updates have come from Bitcoin (BTC) as of late. On the regulatory front, holders remain optimistic after Trump nominated a crypto enthusiast to head the SEC when he officially becomes president. Solana (SOL) Tokenomics Come Under Fire Solana (SOL) has had a good year, gaining 203% in value over the past 12 months. Growth for Solana has been roughly in line with the rest of the crypto space, with some added for good measure. Some Solana (SOL) enthusiasts have criticized the developer team for the tokenomic model Solana uses though. Solana currently has an annual inflation rate of 4.9%. Solana’s goal in this regard is to reach 1.5% eventually, and the current tokenomic approach seeks to balance network incentives with token scarcity. The current rate has worried some holders, though Solana remains a strong pick going into 2025. Lunex Network Offers Distinct Advantages for Traders Lunex Network ($LNEX) sets itself apart with a range of powerful tools to aid high-level trading. Among these tools is a comprehensive portfolio tracker that extends beyond typical exchange tools. Its offering is unique in the sense that it can track EFTs and stocks as well as cryptos, making it a useful aid for traders with multiple investments. A powerful native token, $LNEX, sits at the center of the Lunex Network ecosystem. This token sports a modern revenue-sharing model. This distributes 18% of profits to token holders. These profits are generated through transaction fees and other small premiums, creating an ecosystem that sustains itself while benefiting adopters of the protocol. With a capped supply of 8 billion tokens, Lunex Network ($LNEX) introduces a deflationary system that enhances scarcity as adoption increases. This setup benefits long-term holders by increasing the token’s potential value over time. Lunex Network ($LNEX) also appeals to developers with its robust infrastructure, which includes 65 RPC nodes for efficient decentralized application development. These nodes facilitate seamless blockchain communication, delivering low latency and high performance, essential for building scalable applications. Investors Race to Secure $LNEX Tokens Currently, $LNEX tokens are available for just $0.0038 , attracting strong interest from investors. With Lunex Network’s specialized tools for both traders and developers, analysts predict a 2000% surge in value by the end of 2024. For those seeking substantial returns, Lunex Network offers a promising investment opportunity.

Unfortunately, the market could not stay above the range for long; at the time of close on December 5, the market plummeted to $96,902.91. Although between December 6 and 8, the market witnessed a growth of 4.2%, pushing the price again above the $100K range, in the next couple of days, the market saw the price sharply dropping by at least 4.4%. The market has not yet recovered from the fall. Let’s example what’s holding BTC back, and whether the market can break past $100,000 sustainably. Liquidity Inflows Slow Down Among the two key reasons that are holding Bitcoin back, the primary one is liquidity. Reports say that inflows from stablecoins, BTC ETFs and futures markets have reduced considerably in the last 30 days. The Liquidity Impulse chart shows that inflows have sharply dropped from $15 billion to $7 billion. Strong activity in channels, including stablecoins, BTC ETFs and futures, is necessary for the growth of Bitcoin. Want to know where Bitcoin is heading next?

Nvidia’s Impact on Bitcoin’s Price Secondly, since December 5, the price of NVIDIA Corporation has slipped by over 6.8%. Experts claim that there is a strong correlation between NVIDIA and Bitcoin. Last year, both BTC and NVDA showed impressive performance; the NVDA market grew by approximately 245.53%, while the BTC market surged by over 155.4%. This year, also, NVIDIA has outperformed Bitcoin . The NVIDIA market has raisen over 180% so far, while Bitcoin has grown just a little more than 130%. Although in November 2024, Bitcoin demonstrated an impressive growth of 37.4% – the highest monthly return since February, it was a miserable period for NVIDIA, which could only secure a minor growth of 2.68%. This month, the NVDA market opened at $138.67. Between December 3 and 4, it climbed from $138.22 to a peak of over $145.13. Since then, it has dropped by 6.89%. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Survive the Altcoin Market Crash!

37501753,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=625891,1733915783,Ethena’s USDe surpasses the supply of DAI as Ethereum (ETH) sentiment improves,"Ethena is on an expansion streak for its USDe supply, reflecting favorable market conditions. USDe’s growth has put the asset ahead of DAI/USDS, as investors migrated because of the higher yield of the Ethena protocol. The supply of the stablecoin continued to expand above 5B tokens and has now broken above the total circulating DAI/USDS. The supply of DAI stalled for months as Maker DAO was handling its rebranding and shift to a new collateral structure as part of the Sky Ecosystem. The Sky ecosystem has been more conservative in its growth, mostly relying on Aave partnerships, while overhauling its portfolio of assets. DAI remains one of the key stablecoins for DeFi, retaining sustainable demand, but USDe is riding a new hype wave. USDe is rapidly expanding its supply to become the third-largest stablecoin. | Source: DeFi Llama The total supply of USDe expanded to $5.564B, becoming the third-largest stablecoin and the most influential DeFi stablecoin. Ethena Labs celebrated the 5B token milestone on December 5, and less than a week later, the supply added another 5% in growth. The last 3B tokens were minted in the past two months, as BTC reached new records and ETH started on a path of recovery. USDe supply grows on favorable market conditions USDe is entirely synthetic, tied to Ethena Labs’s earning potential. The supply growth in the past few months has been the steepest so far, as it easily surpassed its previous peak of 3.6B tokens. In 2024, the Ethena Labs issued stablecoin expanded from an initial supply of just 34M tokens, having survived a market drawdown in Q3. USDe is mostly used as a passive income token, with only $103M in daily trades. Unlike other stablecoins, USDe has limited trading pairs and swaps just 1.82% of its supply daily. It is also used more conservatively as collateral in other protocols. Part of USDe’s stability lies in its staked form, which has a minimum of seven days and up to 90 days for withdrawal. Staked USDe (sUSDe) also grew rapidly to above 3.75B tokens, while offering yields of 30%. In the past year, sUSDe has been trading at an ever-growing premium, currently reaching $1.13. However, the asset is mostly swapped on the Curve DEX and has a relatively limited market. The staked form may also fluctuate during unfavorable market conditions, requiring either a supply burn or a new strategy from Ethena Labs. In the meantime, Ethena found ways to offer higher returns to generate more demand for stablecoin investments. Ethena’s approach is considered riskier, but a favorable market scenario allows the protocol to expand its stablecoin issuance and offer its high yields. The expansion of USDe arrives at a time when the total circulation of stablecoins is at $192.8B, dominated by USDT and USDC. Asset-backed stablecoins are one of the main factors for the expansion of the crypto market, which also leads to the growth of DeFi. Ethena Labs reached peak earnings in November A general bullish trend for ETH and funding for long positions make up the ideal conditions for Ethena Labs. As a result, Ethena achieved $7.1M in monthly earnings, surpassing its October record of $3.14M . Previously viewed with skepticism, Ethena Labs managed to show its strategy for market drawdowns, as ETH cycled between bullish expectations and drawdowns. The native ENA token reflected the project’s expansionary stage. ENA recently recovered above $1.07, later sliding to $0.97. ENA may not finish the year with a net gain, but Ethena Labs has positioned itself as a fat fee app. Ethena Labs also attempts to grow aggressively as the protocol is still smaller compared to other DeFi hubs. Ethena is just behind the Maker/Sky Ecosystem in terms of collaterals and value locked even though it is solidly in the top 10 among DeFi apps. Ethena Labs locks in $5.56B in value based on the valuation of USDe in circulation. Ethena Labs has been riding the recently improved ETH market sentiment. The switch to an altcoin season helped ETH break above $4,000 for the first time in months, and gain support at the $3,700 level. At the time of this publication, ETH trades at $3,701.61 as BTC recovered the $98,000 level.

37502265,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51888,1733915661,"Ripple (XRP) Price Set to Hit $8.65, but Long After Rising Token at $0.125 Rockets to $17","Riding a wave of steady upward momentum, Ripple (XRP) has been increasing for six straight days. Positive elements include Ripple’s notable legal successes, increased institutional interest, generally good market climate, and extended surge. With milestones not seen since 2018, these events have solidified XRP’s position as a significant participant in the cryptocurrency market. At $2.39 right now, XRP recently hit an intraday high of $2.50—the highest amount in six years. Rising to an amazing $136.62 billion, its market capitalization guarantees its fourth-largest ranking among cryptocurrencies, above Solana and Binance Coin. This increase emphasizes investors’ hope for XRP’s dependability and profitability. Since 2024 began, XRP has seen an amazing 300% price rise. Its value has skyrocketed by 375% in the past thirty days alone; the token has been rising for six straight trading sessions. Reflecting an amazing 80% gain in a few weeks, XRP has added almost $1.10 to its value over this period. Could XRP hit $8.65? The cryptocurrency market is humming with conjecture about XRP’s future course. A bullish flag formation on XRP’s technical chart piques analysts’ interest. Renowned for indicating major price breaks, this structure points to XRP’s surge, suggesting it could last well beyond present values. The pattern’s target shows a short-term price higher than $2.75. Some analysts think XRP will rise to $5 in the next bull cycle if market circumstances are good and institutional usage keeps growing, reaching $8.65 by 2028. Such expansion would mark a fresh chapter for Ripple, particularly as the business improves its worldwide payments system and progressively combines blockchain technologies with conventional financial systems. Even with such an optimistic view, XRP’s rise might not be the most amazing in the larger cryptocurrency market. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Future Star Although XRP attracts a lot of interest, another initiative is quickly rising as a top candidate for those looking for exponential gains. Currently valued at just $0.125, Rexas Finance (RXS) has been attracting popularity as a creative blockchain tool to transform asset tokenizing. Rexas Finance was officially launched in September 202, and its strong use case has already started attracting retail and institutional investors alike. With this platform, it is now possible to tokenize physical assets such as real estate, collectibles, and fine art, thus making illiquid markets liquid. Thanks to this fresh approach, Rexas Finance is positioned as a game-changer in the growing cryptocurrency market. Strong demand has shown from Rexas Finance’s presale phases; the project has raised $23,885,392 and sold over 315 million tokens. Closing at $0.175 by December 31, 2024, the token’s listing at $0.20 in January 2025 is predicted to drive its value even more. Why might RXS Reach $17? The fast ascent of Rexas Finance stems from its original value proposition and increasing acceptance. Already estimating RXS to hit $17 during the next significant bull market, analysts are predicting an amazing 13,500% increase. Unlike XRP, whose rise depends on its continuous acceptance in cross-border transactions and legal clarity, RXS provides a more varied spectrum of uses. The platform’s creative tools—the Rexas Token Builder and QuickMint Bot—help streamline the creation and administration of tokenized assets. Rexas Finance is a favorite among blockchain enthusiasts because of its security and user-friendliness. Its most recent listing on sites like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko has also increased investor access and visibility. Furthermore, the state of the markets is very important for Rexas Finance’s ability to surpass XRP. Although XRP’s expansion is predicted to remain consistent, the altcoin market sometimes honors initiatives with revolutionary technologies and great upside potential. Rexas Finance is a top option for exponential gains since it checks both criteria. Conclusion The amazing surge to $2.50 and expected climb to $8.65 of ripple indicate the growing belief in XRP’s long-term possibilities. Legal clarity and institutional acceptance continue to strengthen its status as a significant cryptocurrency. Its road to $8.65 might take years, though, so other exciting initiatives like Rexas Finance have a chance to flourish. Rexas Finance, at under $0.125, is a high-risk, high-reward investment with a possible 13,500% surge to $17. With the market turning increasingly toward creative altcoins, RXS’s original method of asset tokenizing might alter the crypto scene and provide early investors with unmatched rewards. For those looking for the next breakthrough star, Rexas Finance presents an irresistible possibility.

This decision reflects the cautious stance of the company's leadership toward crypto assets. The proposal aimed to encourage Microsoft's board to assess Bitcoin’s role in diversifying the company’s treasury. Its rejection highlights the ongoing debate about corporate adoption of Bitcoin.Proposal Pitched Bitcoin as Inflation HedgeMicrosoft’s proxy statement outlined the proposal, highlighting Bitcoin's strong historical performance compared to traditional corporate bonds. Proponents argued that adding Bitcoin to the company’s assets could improve its financial resilience by diversifying its treasury holdings.However, Microsoft’s board recommended against the proposal, citing concerns over Bitcoin’s volatility and preferring the stability of traditional investments for its financial strategy. Shareholders ultimately sided with the board’s recommendation, signaling limited interest in exploring cryptocurrency investments at this time.The board’s position aligns with advisory firms like Glass Lewis, which opposed the proposal. These firms pointed out the lack of concrete evidence that cryptocurrencies can enhance corporate returns.Ultimately, their position proves the broader hesitancy among large corporations to adopt Bitcoin amidst its unpredictable value fluctuations.Michael Saylor Advocated for AdoptionBefore the recent outcome, MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor, a prominent Bitcoin advocate, presented a compelling case for Bitcoin adoption during Microsoft’s shareholder discussions. Saylor argued that Bitcoin represents a transformative financial technology that Microsoft should embrace, positioning it as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. He also emphasized its potential for significant growth in both value and utility.Despite his efforts, including a presentation to Microsoft’s board, Saylor’s arguments failed to sway shareholders. His vision centered on Bitcoin as a tool to enhance capital preservation and productivity while mitigating risks associated with traditional financial strategies.It is important to note that as of December 1, MicroStrategy had achieved a year-to-date Bitcoin yield of 63.3%.

Its recent performance has been shaky. Its failed attempts to pass the latest resistance has raised concerns if it is losing power. Is there any chance to recover? Is bonk preparing for a rally? Let’s analyse the market and find out. Prices Are Down, But Is It Over? Right now, BONK is priced at $0.00003710. That’s a 2.87% drop in the last 24 hours and a 15% decline over the past week. It’s not just the price—trading volume has fallen too, down by 40.26%. The token is also 37.16% below its all-time high of $0.00005916. On top of that, BONK has struggled to break past a resistance level of $0.00004855 since November 24, failing three times. These numbers don’t look good. BONK’s under pressure, and the path to recovery won’t be easy. Support Levels and Bearish Signals Very recently, Bonk has slipped below a crucial support level at $0.0000387. This has traders worried about its future. The next support lies at $0.00003239, which has some potential to prevent the price fall, in case. If that breaks, the worst scenario would be the price drop to $0.00002804. The most concerning thing at present is the moving average 200 which has crossed over MA 20 and 50. This typically signals more downward movement. If the price does not bounce back quickly, there are chances of MA 200 crossing over MA 100 which can trigger a market panic. Could Recovery Be Around the Corner? Not every technical indicator is giving out a bad signal for Bonk. The RSI looks good and gives an impression of an upward movement. Currently recorded at 40.13, it is moving out of the oversold territory. This can be the bullish signal the investors have been waiting for. Is bonk preparing for the rally, BOP shows a yes sign for that. The balance of power indicator at 0.89 gives out a bullish signal. The MACD line is edging closer to a bullish crossover. The bearish histogram is weakening too. If this crossover happens soon, it could mark the beginning of a recovery. BONK needs to reclaim $0.00003874 and close a 4-hour candle above it to regain lost ground. This could set the stage for $0.00004469 or even $0.00004855 if momentum builds. What to Expect For traders, BONK’s current position is both a risk and an opportunity. Those betting on a recovery might see this as a chance to buy in at lower prices. But if key support levels break, it could trigger panic selling and push prices lower. So, what’s next? Is bonk preparing for the rally, looks like yes.Its future depends on holding its support levels and building momentum. Keep an eye on the RSI, MACD, and resistance levels. It’s not just a story of decline—it could also be one of resilience.",NEGATIVE,BONK,BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | BONK,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/is-bonk-preparing-for-a-rally-technical-indicators-are-bullish/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

It's worth noting that trading with 500x leverage is a tremendous risk as the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies means that the position will be liquidated most of the time.

Crying Kamala (CRYKAMA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because CRYKAMA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Crying Kamala can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crying Kamala could become the next viral memecoin. Crying Kamala launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Crying Kamala on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Crying Kamala by entering its contract address – 5eCJhSGBUN4YwJHLU9ZcWjrjmoufVznjzNBHfo4TN1P7 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CRYKAMA.

37502263,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51882,1733915051,"Based On Cardano Cycle Data, Analyst Predicts Timeline For ADA to Hit $3","Cardano (ADA) has experienced a sharp decline in market value over the past week, dropping 17%. This downturn has left investors divided on its short-term prospects, with some experts offering optimistic predictions while others highlight ongoing bearish trends. As of today, ADA is trading at $1.03 after dropping from $1.30 last week. Amid the volatility, prominent analysts are discussing Cardano’s potential price trajectory. Cardano’s Path to $3: Bullish Projections Dan Gambardello, a well-known Cardano advocate, remains optimistic about ADA’s recovery, forecasting a potential surge to $3 within the next month. Citing the cryptocurrency’s historical price behavior, particularly its rally between Q4 2020 and Q1 2021, Gambardello suggested that ADA could “realistically” hit $3 by January 10, 2025. However, he added a more measured perspective, stating that January 24 might be a more achievable target, as his forecasts often lean slightly prematurely. While his prediction has sparked excitement among Cardano enthusiasts, it is tempered by the realities of current market conditions. The Cardano pump to $2 will likely be here sooner than most people realize. And according to cycle data, the pump back to $3 could realistically occur by January 10. Since I’m usually slightly early with these things, let’s say January 24th. — Dan Gambardello (@cryptorecruitr) December 10, 2024 Key Challenges for ADA’s Bull Run In contrast to Gambardello’s bullish stance, analyst Ali Martinez emphasizes the critical support levels ADA must maintain to regain upward momentum. According to Martinez, the $1.20 level is a crucial price point, supported by approximately 93,000 addresses holding 2.54 billion ADA. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Failure to hold above this support could lead to a significant downturn, potentially dragging ADA below $1. Martinez noted that bearish sentiment remains prevalent, with 64.68% of ADA holders facing unrealized losses. This situation could contribute to additional selling pressure, even during minor price rebounds. On the brighter side, a demand zone between $0.98 and $1.02 offers some reassurance. This range, which involves 41,720 addresses holding 1.03 billion ADA, may provide temporary stability if the cryptocurrency faces further downward pressure. On-Chain Metrics Signal Reduced Activity On-chain data paints a concerning picture of Cardano’s short-term performance. Metrics from IntoTheBlock highlight significant drops in network activity. Over the past week, the creation of new addresses has declined by 44.90%, while active addresses have fallen by 38.66%. Additionally, the number of zero-balance addresses decreased by 46.15%, reflecting reduced participation on the network. These figures suggest a slowdown in transactional activity, further emphasizing the challenges ADA faces in regaining market confidence.

The technical indicators of Ripple (XRP) suggest that the cross-border payment token could target $3.5 soon. Also, the second largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum (ETH) could set a new peak soon. Analysts forecast the value of ETH could reach $10k. Meanwhile, the price of IntelMarkets (INTL) might rise by 10x in the coming months. Ripple (XRP) Price Drops But Bullish Indicators Support Rally To $3.5 Ripple (XRP) is showing mixed sentiment on the price chart. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the value of the Ripple crypto has dropped by 20.5% on the 7-day chart. However, it has risen by 274.7% on the 30-day chart. It appears the market is currently cooling down from the effects of Donald Trump’s election victory. In terms of price movement, the Ripple token is consolidating between $2.14 and $2.82 in the weekly timeframe. Technical analyst Michaël van de Poppe noted that the Ripple price could find support at $1.81 or $1.57 if the downtrend continues in the near future. On the flip side, Cryptoknight890 has a different prediction. He forecasts the value of the altcoin could climb to $3.5 in the coming weeks. Looking at Ripple’s (XRP) technical indicators, most of them are still in the green territory. The VWMA (10) and Hull Moving Average (9) are flashing buy signals which is a sign that bulls are active. Thus, the XRP price could climb upward in the coming weeks. Ethereum (ETH) Is Programmed To Hit $10k, Says Analysts Ethereum (ETH) has suffered a minor correction after its latest attempt to flip the $4k level into support. The altcoin came very close as it rose to a weekly peak of $4,067.58. However, the uptrend did not continue and the Ethereum price dropped to former lows. Despite the decline, ETH is still showing price increases on the chart. Data from CoinMarketCap reveals its value has risen by 1.7% on the weekly chart and 16.7% on the monthly level. Crypto analyst, Wolf, told his followers this downtrend could be their last chance to buy the Ethereum token. According to him, the Ethereum coin has strong support at $3.5k. He forecasts the value of the cryptocurrency could rise to $10,500 in the coming weeks. Captain Faibik also posted a similar prediction. He said ETH to $10k is programmed.

Analyst Explains Overlooked Reasons!,"Although Bitcoin (BTC) has surpassed the critical level of $ 100,000, the cryptocurrency market has been dominated by declines in recent days. At this point, while the BTC price has been moving in a price range of $90,000 to $100,000 in recent weeks, the experienced analyst explained why the Bitcoin price has not been able to rise. Slow liquidity inflows and Nvidia’s stalled rally could be holding back Bitcoin’s rally, 10X Research founder Markus Thielen wrote in a note to clients. First of all, Thileen stated that the liquidity flow to the cryptocurrency market through channels such as spot Bitcoin ETFs has slowed down significantly, and that this situation has hindered the upward momentum. Stating that other technical indicators, apart from ETFs, also show that net liquidity inflow to the cryptocurrency market has slowed down, the analyst stated that another obstacle to the rise is Nvidia. Accordingly, the analyst said that the pause in the uptrend of Nvidia (NVDA), which is a pioneer in artificial intelligence and risk assets, also hindered the rise in BTC and cryptocurrencies. “This slowdown in liquidity growth may explain why Bitcoin has struggled to maintain levels above $100,000. Another overlooked reason is the slowdown in the uptrend in the shares of the world’s largest chipmaker, Nvidia (NVDA). BTC and NVDA bottomed in late 2022 and have had a strong positive correlation since then – except for the summer. However, NVDA’s uptrend has slowed since mid-November. This is the second reason that is holding back Bitcoin’s rise.” Bitcoin continues to trade at $97,780 at the time of writing. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Why Can't Bitcoin Rise?

37501161,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=625881,1733914645,"MicroStrategy expected to join Nasdaq 100 this month, S&P 500 eligibility by 2025","MicroStrategy is likely to enter the Nasdaq 100 index on December 23, with the announcement expected as early as December 13. Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart broke the news, predicting that the software company turned Bitcoin whale could hold a weight of about 0.47% in the index. This would make it the 40th largest holding among the $550 billion worth of ETFs tracking the Nasdaq 100. Moderna is reportedly on its way out to make room for MicroStrategy. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 remains out of reach for now, largely due to profitability issues. But Eric thinks that changes to accounting rules for Bitcoin valuation might make MicroStrategy eligible by 2025. Massive convertible bonds drive Bitcoin hoard MicroStrategy’s rise in prominence started with a pivot in August 2020, when the company transformed itself from an enterprise software vendor to a Bitcoin-dominated entity. Its latest decision? Issuing a $3 billion zero-coupon convertible bond with a 55% conversion premium—the fifth such issuance this year—to buy even more Bitcoin. The bond is set to mature in five years. The company’s plan seems straightforward: borrow money at zero interest, use it to buy Bitcoin and repay the debt once the stock price skyrockets. The catch? It only works if Bitcoin trades at or above $100,000. Right now, MicroStrategy’s stock is trading at a huge premium to the net asset value (NAV) of its Bitcoin holdings, making the strategy viable *only* for now. But the allure of this financing model hasn’t gone unnoticed. Last week, Bitcoin miner Marathon Digital Holdings followed suit, issuing $850 million in zero-coupon convertible bonds with a 40% conversion premium. MicroStrategy’s approach relies heavily on its stock’s volatility, which analysts say is the true driver behind the favorable terms of its bonds. By leveraging its wild price swings, the company has essentially engineered a mechanism to secure cheap funding for its Bitcoin acquisition spree. Volatility: MicroStrategy’s secret weapon MicroStrategy’s stock volatility is actually part of the company’s strategy. The stock has a 252-day historic volatility rate of 106%, translating to daily price swings of around 6.6%. Its 30-day implied volatility is 2.5 times higher than that of Bitcoin itself. This extreme unpredictability makes the embedded call options in MicroStrategy’s convertible bonds particularly valuable. They offset the cost of borrowing and allow the firm to secure funds at highly advantageous rates. Michael Saylor, the company’s co-founder and arguably Bitcoin’s strongest believer, plays a key role in stoking this volatility. His public statements, media appearances, and relentless social media activity serve to amplify the stock’s unpredictability. Before the Bitcoin pivot, the stock’s volatility hovered in the low 30s. Now, it’s consistently over 100%, creating a feedback loop where higher volatility leads to better bond terms, which in turn fund more Bitcoin purchases, further increasing volatility. Saylor’s investors often use a strategy called gamma trading to capitalize on the stock’s volatility. This involves dynamically shorting and buying shares to maintain a neutral position as the stock price fluctuates. For instance, an investor buying $1,000 of a MicroStrategy convertible bond might initially short $500 worth of stock. As the stock price rises, they would sell more shares to stay neutral. Conversely, if the stock falls, they will buy back shares.

Dogecoin recently yielded fair returns, and the whales are looking to reinvest their gains in promising new crypto coins like 1Fuel. Crypto whales are attracted to the 1Fuel presale due to its high adoption potential. The crypto solution offers a rare cross-chain functionality, which could make it popular among users. The increasing popularity will drive 1Fuel’s value, making it a top token to invest in. 1fuel Tipped For Incredible Market Success Crypto whales are convinced that 1Fuel is one of the promising new crypto coins to consider investing in. The presale token is flashing a strong buy signal and could reward early investors with 200× or more. 1Fuel has important utilities that can spur its adoption and allow it to remain imports for a long while. This makes the token a good choice of investment for potential investors. The promise of simplified and cheaper cross-chain transactions is among the chief reasons why 1Fuel will become a go-to for users. The DeFi solution is coming with a feature that will enable users to trade different coins on different networks with just one click. Market observers see this feature as a game changer as it will eliminate the need to hold multiple wallets or pay high exchange fees. This will make 1Fuel the major wallet option for crypto users. In addition to the innovative cross-chain solution, 1Fuel will allow peer-to-peer exchange and offer cold storage to users. The new wallet aims to become the one-stop solution to every DeFi need, and these features will help it achieve that. 1Fuel will facilitate better portfolio performance and improved risk management. It guarantees better security and improved risk management while capping it up with promises of faster and cheaper transactions. With 1Fuel’s numerous functions and solutions, experts expect it to have a good run in the crypto space. The 1Fuel token will prove pivotal to the platform’s success, making it potentially important. Joining 1Fuel presale could be among the smart crypto decisions ahead of 2025, as the token looks poised for a solid market rally. Dogecoin Whales Take Profit, But Meme Coin Could Rally Back Again Dogecoin’s recent dump from $0.48 to $0.40 could be the beginning of a general price correction affecting the whole market. Dogecoin may dump below its nearest support at $0.35 during this period, but analysts expect a bullish reversal to follow suit when the market settles. In the meantime, crypto whales are looking to consolidate profit. Dogecoin yielded about 100% in the past month, and smart investors are not prepared to see it dump. This move could see Dogecoin dump further, but new investors’ entry could even that out. Analysts say Dogecoin’s dip is inevitable regardless of investors’ actions. However, they’re optimistic the meme coin wouldn’t struggle as much as it did in Q1 to Q2. The expectation is that Dogecoin will rally beyond $0.5 by Q2 2025, with a new all-time high looking likely before the third quarter of next year. Despite the dip, Dogecoin could reward existing and new investors in the coming year, making it a good buy presently. Dogecoin is still one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap despite a lack of unique utilities. This is due to the meme coin’s strong community support and developers’ efforts. These factors may once again work in Dogecoin’s favor in 2025. Conclusion 1Fuel seems to be the best safety net for Dogecoin whales. The new token is in its presale phase, free from the market’s volatility, and has a promising prospect. This makes it an ideal choice of investment for savvy investors.

Still, through its surge, the token has also experienced significant volatility, with several violent – if brief – corrections. One cryptocurrency analyst, CrediBULL Crypto, however, sees such performance as profoundly bullish for XRP. Specifically, per the expert’s analysis, there are ‘NO coins in the space right now that have printed such clear impulsive PA on their rises’ as XRP, and concluded that such performance demonstrates the strength and momentum behind the token . Furthermore, such clarity in the chart enables investors to spot both impulsive and corrective price action easily, and the analyst believes it will all lead XRP ‘to outperform the entire market in the coming months.’ XRP chart with the clear impulsive and corrective moves marked. Source: @CredibleCrypto How has XRP’s latest correction affected the forecast? In the X post, CrediBULL Crypto also reflected on the token’s latest price action. Specifically, he predicted that XRP was, at the time of the tweet, nearing the end of the corrective move and that, once it emerges from the ravine, it will be ‘show time (again).’ At the time of the post – very early in the morning of December 11 – XRP started exiting a violent downturn that sent it from approximately $2.41 on December 9 to as low as $1.98 on December 10 before retracing.

Elsewhere, the 7-day chart demonstrates the severity of the recent downturn, as XRP remains 10.91% in the red in that time frame.

Finally, XRP’s future appears bright at press time. Indeed, Donald Trump’s re-election – and the expectation his administration will be far more crypto-friendly than Joe Biden’s – paired will Ripple Labs’ recent courtroom gains against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It is, indeed, worth remembering that the legal battle between the digital assets company and the regulator had been the major reason behind the token’s depressed prices for years. January is also set to be a big month for XRP as Donald Trump will officially assume office, SEC Chair Gary Gensler will resign , and the final chapter in Ripple’s courtroom fight might be closed . Simultaneously, there appears to be no shortage of catalysts in December, as Ripple reportedly received final approval for its stablecoin , RLUSD. Again, it is worth remembering that one of the triggers for the latest correction was the rumor that RLUSD was imminent, followed by a rebuke that the stablecoin wasn’t quite ready.

Launched on the Solana blockchain, Peanut is based on a rescued injured squirrel. Her story morphed into a cause for animal rights, but when she was put down due to public health concerns, it became a hot topic just before the election, with Donald Trump and Elon Musk wading into the conversation. One Tweet By Musk Was Enough For $PNUT to Take Off in Price The natural progression to a meme coin was made, and after Musk promoted it online, the market cap of the coin shot up from $3M to an eye-watering $140M in only 24 hours. Since the middle of November, the price has consistently increased, but its value has declined in the past few days by 9.7%, down to $1.11. However, from what we’re seeing, this seems to be an industry-wide downturn and not one specific to $PNUT. While its future still looks promising, investing in crypto brings no guarantees. Especially a meme coin that seems to owe its staggering growth to a subject that quickly became politicized. If investing in a squirrel meme coin isn’t your thing, or you just missed the 50x $PNUT, then we have two other potentially profitable and bullish meme coins that are worth looking into. Here are the new coins with 55x potential we’re keeping our eyes on 👇 Wall Street Pepe Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is aiming to capitalize on the immensely popular Pepe the Frog meme coin, and so far, it seems to be working. With over $2.5M raised in presale in just a week, Claybro, a popular crypto influencer, also makes some bold price predictions that 2025 will be the year when early investors (those who jump in now in 2024) will see their profits possibly go as high as 500%. So, if you’re looking for a coin to invest in, Wall Street Pepe has very bullish prospects that bode well for a potentially big return on your money. At only $0.000205 per $WEPE right now, this would be the time to buy. Crypto All-Stars Crypto All-Stars ($STARS) is another new meme coin that financial market experts are predicting will shoot up in price at the end of this year and during 2025. With over $2M in presales and a current price of $0.0034067, $STARS is another meme coin that’s expected to bring something around a 500% leap for investors. Obviously, though, this is a prediction, not a guarantee. Invest – But Do Your Due Diligence First Despite all of the positive news you read about $PNUT, $STARS, and $WEPE, we should heavily emphasize the importance of doing your own independent research.

The asset manager hinged the speculation on a sustenance of inflows from the Bitcoin ETFs and demand from corporate entities, which are increasing their exposure to the premier crypto asset.Meanwhile, Bitwise noted that Bitcoin would surpass the $200,000 price mark and surge to $500,000 if the United States created a strategic reserve of the asset.

37500996,https://cryptonews.com/?p=318571,1733914228,"Bitget COO Talks India Expansion, Stresses Compliance as Top Priority","In an exclusive interview with CryptoNews, Bitget COO Vugar Usi Zade shared insights into the exchange’s plans for the Indian market, the challenges posed by local regulations, and how the company aims to solidify its presence in one of the world’s largest crypto ecosystems. Talking about crypto ecosystem in India, Bitget COO said, “The biggest driver now is the legislation. When things are certain, it’s easy to operate,” he said. However, he noted that India’s crypto tax policies —particularly the 1% TDS on every transaction and the steep 30% tax on gains—could act as deterrents. Steep Taxation Could Drive Illicit Activities India currently implements a very steep taxation policy on crypto gains. There is 30% direct tax on crypto profits and 1% tax deductible at source on each crypto transaction, discouraging users from engaging with crypto. Bitget COO expressed concerns about the potential rise of black-market activities given the high taxes on crypto. “Unfortunately, I believe this kind of very harsh taxation may fuel the black market, and therefore the legislators should be very keen to make sure that this kind of black market or like under the table action doesn’t happen. In my opinion, it’s a huge roadblock for users, especially in this economy.” Bitget Gears Up to Scale in India With Compliance-First Approach “We’re in advanced talks with regulators and days away from completing the process,” Usi Zade said on fully launching in India. While the exchange currently serves a limited number of users in India, it plans to onboard new customers only after receiving a green light from authorities. “We want to ensure compliance to avoid fines and serve customers responsibly,” he added, alluding to lessons learned from other exchanges facing regulatory penalties. Earlier, Binance paid a $2.25 million fine to return to India after the authorities blacklisted the exchange over non-compliance. Bitget is also making significant investments in the region. “We are setting up a local office and actively hiring. By the end of the year, we’ll have a local presence with locals helping locals,” Usi Zade said, emphasizing the importance of tailoring operations to the Indian market. Bitget’s plans in India are part of its broader growth narrative. Globally, the exchange has risen to become the fourth-largest, with 45 million users and $10 billion in daily transactions. Key growth markets include Latin America, Turkey, and the CIS countries, where targeted efforts have led to five-to-tenfold growth in user bases, Vugar noted.

37500431,https://coinpedia.org/?p=391790,1733913557,Solana Coin Touches a New High While This Altcoin Could Turn $200 Into $100K,"The post Solana Coin Touches a New High While This Altcoin Could Turn $200 Into $100K appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin is trading near its all-time high of $97K ahead of a crucial week that includes central bank meetings and US inflation data that could result in lower borrowing costs and more policy easing. However, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies experienced a 1% decline in early trading today. Despite that, two coins are catching investors’ sentiment with their lucrative returns: Solana Coin and Bitgert. Solana Coin is running at a rapid speed, touching its ATH, but Bitgert does not seem to be a relatively new coin. It has garnered a high return in the past month. Crypto investors believe that this altcoin, Bitgert, has the potential to turn $200 into a lucrative $100k figure. Let’s examine why and how! Where Does Solana Coin Stand To Bitgert? Solana Coin is now at its best time and giving nice returns. The price movement of Solana Coin at $216 is undoubtedly one of the best in the crypto arena. Solana Coin is still poised with hopes that it can go much higher, but Bitgert is a little faster than it. There are many factors behind this statement. One among those is Bitgert’s speed. Bitgert can process a transaction at a speed of 100k whereas Solana Coins’s speed is much slower at 65k. When Solan was first launched this was quite interesting, but with the advancement of newer coins like Bitgert, it seems a bit down. Solana Coin’s gas cost is also higher than Bitgert’s . When Solana Coin charges between $0.003 to $0.03 per transaction, Bitgert is almost free, just $0.0000001. Solana Coin gained its popularity as the ‘Ethereum Killer’. It was made on the Ethereum chain at lightning-fast speed. It was built on the novel consensus technique, Proof of History. But Bitgert is built on its own L1 blockchain system and follows Proof of Authority, which is much superior to Solana Coin’s PoH (Proof of History). It is a fact that Solana Coin has given substantial returns even during the downturns of the crypto market, still, its network failures are a matter of concern for long-term investments. On the other hand, Bigert has only improved itself since its launch. Within the 200 days of its launch, Bigert brought a bunch of new facilities for its users. From the BRISE wallet to the BRISE blockchain to BRISE staking, Bitgert is nothing short of a new-age coin. Bitgert – $BRISE has a whooping 189k holds and counting more! Bitgert’s daily 2.5k on-chain transactions record proves that Bitgert is a coin for today and tomorrow. So, if you are still in doubt about whether it should be Solana Coin or Bitgert, it is Bitgert of course! Grab your own $BRISE token at Gate.io , PancakeSwap , MEXC , and KuCoin !

Akshay Naheta, the former SoftBank executive behind some of the company’s biggest deals, is reportedly in early discussions to sell a minority stake in the stablecoin payments startup he co-founded, Bloomberg has learned , citing sources close to the matter. Distributed Technologies Research, which uses blockchain to process stablecoins for cross-border payments, is said to use the funds to expand into newer markets, including the U.S., the sources say. The size of the first public fundraise and valuation is not clear at this stage as it negotiates with multiple strategic investors and venture capital firms, the sources say. A spokesperson for DTR said the company is offering payout and pay-in facilities in over 40 countries, which will be scaled to over 100 countries next year with billions of dollars in transactions going through it.

The dogcoin, which proudly calls itself the “son of Shib and protector of BNB” has just been unveiled as the first recipient of the new $20 million memecoin fund launched by web3 investment firm DWF Labs. Commenting on the news, the Koma Inu team enthused : “As one of the recipients of the DWF Meme Fund, we are proud to collaborate with DWF Labs to further our mission of bringing creativity and community to new heights in the Web3 space,” and expressed a desire to make BNB Chain great again. Memecoin Mania Meets Major Backing Despite their playful beginnings, memecoins have evolved into serious community-driven ecosystems that now account for more onchain volume than any other sector, with over $50B in daily volume. Enter DWF Labs , the web3 incubator and VC that recently announced a $20 million meme fund to support the best up-and-coming memecoin projects. By extending grants and investments, DWF aims to help promising memecoin communities grow, develop real-world applications, and build sustainable, community-governed ecosystems. Koma Inu , which taps into the popularity of Shiba Inu-themed tokens and places a unique emphasis on community-driven decentralization and charity, is the first to benefit from this new initiative. Just over a week ago, DWF Labs received a transfer of 15 million $KOMA tokens, worth about $2.12 million at the time. Over the past seven days, DWF Labs has deposited approximately $274K worth of $KOMA to several major exchanges, including Bitget, Gate.io, and MEXC for market-making purposes. This flurry of activity revealed to onchain observers that something bigger was at play for $KOMA, and so it proved to be when Binance announced the listing of Koma Inu perpetual contracts. The arrival of $KOMA perps on Binance signals a level of recognition not often afforded to newer memecoins. Not only does the listing give traders a venue to speculate on $KOMA’s price movements, but it provides more liquidity and potentially greater stability for the token. Memecoins: More Than Just a Joke Behind the dank memes and light-hearted content, memecoins are serious business. They’re the tail that now wags the dog representing the entire crypto market – and yes, of course that dog is a Shibu Inu. The $KOMA perps listing on Binance reiterates that memecoins, once dismissed by many as market curiosities, are now at the heart of the crypto narrative. Despite now accounting for the bulk of all onchain trading activity, however, memecoins remain a polarizing topic. Skeptics argue that the majority of these tokens will never outgrow their whimsical origins, while enthusiasts see them as an accessible entry point for newcomers, a space for grassroots governance, and a playground for innovative tokenomics. The backing of Koma Inu by DWF Labs, coupled with its new presence on Binance and other tier-one exchanges, suggests that there’s plenty of life left in the memecoin sector. If $KOMA can successfully leverage its community spirit and the resources at its disposal, it will set a precedent for other projects to follow.

37500304,https://crypto.news/?p=14318327,1733913289,KOMA up 200% following DWF Labs backing and exchange listings,"Koma Inu, a meme coin based on BNB Chain saw its price skyrocket after securing backing from DWF Labs’ Meme Fund. Koma Inu ( KOMA ) is up 200% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $0.171 at the time of writing. The meme coin reached an all-time high of $0.192 with a $192.2 billion market cap earlier today. KOMA’s daily trading volume has surged by 2,400% over the past day, reaching over $154 million, signaling massive demand from investors. The recent rally has extended the altcoin’s fortnight gains to over 220% and its monthly gains to nearly 2,600%, setting its position as one of the best-performing meme coins. Why is KOMA soaring today? KOMA rallied after DWF Labs, a leading crypto venture capital firm, selected Koma Inu as the inaugural recipient of its $20 million Meme Fund. As a recipient of the fund, designed to support blockchain-agnostic meme coin projects, Koma Inu will benefit from DWF Labs’ support in expanding its market presence, along with access to financial resources and strategic guidance. Further, the meme coin has recently secured a listing on several high-profile centralized exchanges including Binance , Bybit and Bitget expanding its exposure to investors and fueling its recent gains.

As reported earlier by crypto.news, Movement’s native token, MOVE, surged by 50% on Dec. 10, reaching a new all-time high due to similar premier exchange listings. Bolstering the meme coin ecosystem DWF Labs has a strong history of partnering with meme coins and has backed projects that support the development of the meme coin ecosystem. In September, it partnered with meme coin launchpad GraFun to enhance the project’s liquidity. Last year, the firm invested roughly $6 million in the Ethereum-based meme coin Floki across two different investments and has also helped support the project’s development.

It seems like the bullish momentum is slowing down a bit. Despite this, SUI is retesting the critical $4 level, and Ripple’s XRP is in line for a monster rally. Meanwhile, IntelMarkets (INTL) is making headlines with its revolutionary AI-powered trading platform. With $3.9 million raised so far, IntelMarkets is becoming traders’ best bet for life-changing gains. SUI: Retesting the $4 Level After Phantom Wallet Integration SUI (SUI) is one of the prominent performers in the Blockchain space, offering exceptional scalability and efficiency. Recently, SUI announced its integration with Phantom Wallet, a leading-edge crypto wallet with over 7 million active users. This partnership enhances user experience by providing seamless access to SUI’s decentralized applications (dApps) and services. After this announcement SUI blockchain reached its all-time high of $4.47 on December 6. This only illustrates the positive market sentiment that has been building up around the coin in this cycle. SUI is currently trading at $3.68 with a market cap of $11.2B and a daily trading volume of almost $3B. Its current price suggests SUI’s at a pivotal point, with $4 acting as a resistance. If SUI can break past this level, it could climb to new highs, enabled by the expanding use of its network. Although SUI has the potential to perform greatly in the coming period, the existing market cap will limit its room for growth, turning away many investors that are in search for exponential returns. Ripple (XRP): Eyeing a Massive Rally Ripple’s XRP has made a name for itself by gaining attention from institutional investors as it continues to dominate the share of cross-border transactions despite the ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. However recent developments in the case are worth taking a look at. The SEC has dropped the lawsuit against Ripple Labs’ executives, Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen. This decision has been viewed positively by the market, potentially influencing XRP’s valuation. This decision together with market hype made XRP soar to its two yearly high of $2.86 at the start of December. However, Ripple is down 20% in the past 7 days prompting many analysts to come out with predictions of a massive rally to $3.5 before 2025, following this recent stabilization. While XRP remains a popular choice among institutional investors, its current market cap of over $123 billion limits its upside compared to newer, low-cap gems like IntelMarkets. IntelMarkets (INTL): Transforming Crypto Trading While SUI and XRP hold their respected place as top cryptos, IntelMarkets (INTL) has emerged as a rising star that’s quickly capturing attention. IntelMarkets is an upcoming project offering an AI-powered DeFi platform, which is set as a revolutionary investment in the crypto trading market. Key Advantages of IntelMarkets: AI-Driven Trading: Artificial intelligence combined with IntelMarkets revolutionary trading bots are implemented for real time analysis of market conditions, allowing the user to gain profitable predictive signals and strategies unlike anywhere else. Dual-Chain Architecture: INTL works on the Ethereum and Solana blockchains ensuring scalability and compatibility with all the available ecosystems. Self-Learning Robots: These trading bots can process massive data volumes and improve through self-learning algorithms, empowering users with automated, high-accuracy trading tools. The performance of IntelMarkets presale speaks volumes. With more $3.9 million raised already INTL is one of the most promising projects in the market. Its token is priced at just $0.064, allowing for an excellent opportunity for early investors. Having a low market cap and projections for massive growth after exchange listings, IntelMarkets is the altcoin to watch out for in 2025 . Conclusion SUI and XRP compete head to head for gains while IntelMarkets (INTL) , stands out as a groundbreaking alternative, delivering exponential returns for those early opportunity grabbers. Its AI-powered trading platform, coupled with a bullish narrative, sets it apart from other altcoins. With the presale already generating $3.9 million, IntelMarkets is on track to be the next big thing in crypto in 2025.

Chainlink Integrates with Coinbase’s Project Diamond, Advancing Tokenized Asset Management Chainlink, the prominent blockchain oracle network, has announced its integration with Coinbase’s Project Diamond. This collaboration brings together Chainlink’s robust data and interoperability capabilities with Coinbase’s institutional-grade digital asset platform. The partnership is expected to revolutionize the management and functionality of tokenized assets, particularly for global institutions. Project Diamond, regulated by the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) of the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), operates under the trade name Onchain Marketplace. As a resident of the ADGM RegLab sandbox, the platform has been designed to support institutional adoption of digital assets while maintaining strict regulatory compliance. The integration with Chainlink marks a pivotal upgrade to its capabilities, enabling comprehensive lifecycle management of tokenized assets. A key component of this integration is Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), which will facilitate secure and seamless data flow between public and private blockchains as well as traditional financial systems. The protocol ensures a compliant and interoperable solution for institutions exploring blockchain-based tokenization. Marcel Kasumovich, Deputy Chief Investment Officer at Coinbase Asset Management, emphasized the transformative potential of the integration, stating, “By integrating the Chainlink standard natively into the Project Diamond platform, powered by Coinbase's tech stack on Base, we're paving the way for widespread institutional adoption of digital assets.” The integration has also brought Peregrine, a business unit of PSG Digital regulated by the ADGM, into the spotlight as a flagship user of the upgraded Project Diamond platform. This highlights the real-world applications of the collaboration, showcasing how financial institutions can leverage blockchain technology for secure and efficient tokenized asset management. Chainlink’s Growing Footprint This partnership aligns with Chainlink’s broader mission to expand its global presence and support the tokenized asset market, which the company predicts will grow to a staggering $10 trillion by 2030. Chainlink Labs, the primary developer of the network, recently established a dedicated entity in Abu Dhabi under the ADGM Registration Authority to drive expansion in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Angie Walker, Chainlink Labs Global Head of Banking and Capital Markets and Senior Executive Officer for Chainlink Labs Abu Dhabi, expressed optimism about the region’s potential, “The MENA region has become a global destination for innovators from around the world and a hub for the adoption of onchain finance.” Chainlink’s influence extends beyond Project Diamond. The company has forged a partnership with SWIFT, enabling users of the legacy messaging system to interact with blockchain technology, a move that could bridge the gap between traditional finance and decentralized systems. Additionally, Chainlink is a key participant in the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s Project Guardian, where it has developed technology to allow users to establish privacy settings for their data—further solidifying its role as a pioneer in blockchain innovation. Launched in December 2023, Project Diamond exemplifies Coinbase’s push to create institutional-grade solutions in the digital asset space. However, it is worth noting that the platform is not available to users in the United States, emphasizing its focus on global markets. Chainlink’s CCIP, introduced in April, adds an essential layer of functionality, enabling cross-chain token transfers and smart contract messaging across multiple blockchain networks. The integration of Chainlink’s oracle technology into Project Diamond sets a new standard for institutional blockchain adoption. With regulatory backing from ADGM and cutting-edge interoperability solutions, this collaboration signals a major step toward mainstream acceptance of tokenized assets and blockchain-powered finance. As the blockchain ecosystem continues to mature, the collaboration between Chainlink and Coinbase’s Project Diamond is poised to become a blueprint for institutional adoption of tokenized assets. With predictions of exponential market growth and increasing regulatory clarity, the stage is set for blockchain technology to redefine the global financial landscape. Chainlink’s growing network of partnerships, including its role in MENA and collaboration with SWIFT, reinforces its position as a cornerstone of blockchain interoperability. Meanwhile, Project Diamond’s robust regulatory foundation and advanced capabilities make it a critical player in the evolution of digital asset management. Together, Chainlink and Coinbase are charting a course toward a more connected, tokenized future. Crypto.com Partners with Deutsche Bank to Expand Corporate Banking Services in Asia-Pacific Leading cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com has announced a partnership with Deutsche Bank to provide corporate banking services. This strategic alliance will focus on key markets such as Singapore, Australia, and Hong Kong, with plans for future expansion into the United Kingdom and European countries. The partnership will see Deutsche Bank, a global financial powerhouse, deliver a suite of services tailored for cryptocurrency firms. These services include digital asset custody, fiat-to-crypto exchange, and cross-border trading. By aligning with Deutsche Bank, Crypto.com aims to enhance its operational efficiency and provide robust banking solutions to its corporate clients. Deutsche Bank’s foray into digital assets and its ability to bridge traditional finance (TradFi) with decentralized finance (DeFi) aligns seamlessly with Crypto.com’s vision. The partnership is expected to fortify Crypto.com’s banking infrastructure, ensuring compliance and scalability in an increasingly regulated environment. Crypto.com’s partnership with Deutsche Bank builds upon the exchange’s aggressive expansion strategy in the Asia-Pacific region. Headquartered in Singapore, Crypto.com has been actively bolstering its regional footprint. In November, the exchange acquired Australian brokerage and trading company Fintek Securities. This acquisition enabled Crypto.com to offer regulated traditional financial products, further diversifying its portfolio. In Hong Kong, Crypto.com holds a ”deemed to be licensed” status with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC). This designation reflects the SFC’s progressive stance on digital assets, as it prepares to issue licenses to at least 11 firms operating in the local market. The Asia-Pacific region continues to exhibit strong growth in cryptocurrency adoption, with Singapore, Hong Kong, and the UAE leading the charge. According to a study by Henley & Partners, Singapore ranks as the top destination for crypto adoption globally, credited to its advanced banking system, significant investments in digital assets, and comprehensive regulatory framework. While many traditional financial institutions are integrating digital asset services, Crypto.com is taking a unique approach by expanding into traditional finance. The exchange’s recently unveiled 2025 roadmap outlines plans to offer stocks, derivatives trading, banking services, and credit card solutions. These traditional offerings complement its existing crypto-focused services, creating a comprehensive ecosystem for its users. In October, Crypto.com also acquired Watchdog Capital, a US-regulated broker-dealer. This acquisition positioned the exchange to offer stocks and equity options to eligible traders in the United States. However, Crypto.com is not alone in its pursuit of hybrid financial models in the Asia-Pacific region. OKX, another prominent crypto exchange, has made strides in integrating traditional financial services. In November, OKX introduced fiat deposit and withdrawal capabilities for Singaporean customers after securing a local payment institution license. The company also strengthened its regulatory expertise by appointing a former regulator as the CEO of its Singapore subsidiary. Driving Crypto Adoption in Asia-Pacific The Asia-Pacific region remains a critical battleground for cryptocurrency exchanges due to its rapid adoption of digital assets. Singapore’s leadership in crypto adoption, coupled with Hong Kong’s regulatory advancements, shows the region’s significance. Partnerships like that of Crypto.com and Deutsche Bank are part of a growing trend of collaboration between crypto firms and traditional financial institutions, aiming to address regulatory challenges and foster trust among institutional and retail users. As Crypto.com and Deutsche Bank deepen their partnership, the focus will likely shift to delivering seamless, compliant, and scalable solutions for the burgeoning crypto economy. The potential expansion into Europe and the UK represents an opportunity to replicate their success in Asia-Pacific on a global scale. With its diversified strategy and a strong foothold in the region, Crypto.com is well-positioned to lead the charge in integrating traditional finance and blockchain technologies. This partnership signals not just a business collaboration but a step toward the broader acceptance of digital assets in mainstream financial systems.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | LINK,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6488/chainlink-boosts-tokenized-finance-through-coinbase-collaboration,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png
37508815,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=104723,1733913015,Here are 7 Key Points Donald Trump’s Son Eric Made About Bitcoin,"Donald Trump's second son, Eric Trump, is bullish on Bitcoin, highlighting its capability to transform the global economy and its other prowess. Eric Trump, a real estate businessman, spoke highly of BTC in yesterday's keynote address at the Bitcoin MENA event in Abu Dhabi. Consequently, we have compiled seven crucial remarks he made about Bitcoin in the keynote.Bitcoin is a Global Asset, Not Just an Investment Eric dismissed claims that Bitcoin is only suitable for investment. Over the years, critics have argued that Bitcoin is just another asset for speculative investment. In particular, Fed Chair Jerome Powell recently labeled Bitcoin a speculative asset, similar to gold. However, Eric thinks Bitcoin's functions extend beyond the investment classification. According to him, Bitcoin is a global asset that serves as a store of value and a hedge against political instability as well as inflation.No Middlemen For Eric, Bitcoin solves some of the issues inherent in the traditional finance (TradFi) sector. Specifically, he praised Bitcoin's decentralized nature, which allows users to conduct transactions without relying on third parties. Per Eric, traditional financial institutions heavily rely on middlemen, resulting in exorbitant fees imposed on users.Bitcoin to Hit $1 Million The American businessman made a bold prediction for Bitcoin, projecting that the asset will surge to $1 million someday. This projection comes days after Bitcoin slumped below the $100,000 mark. Although several Bitcoin proponents, like investment manager Bernstein, had previously set the $1 million target, Eric's latest remark bolsters investors’ hopes in the projection. Fundamental Shift in How People Think About Money Further, he noted that the advent of Bitcoin has changed the way the world thinks and interacts with money. Using himself as an example, Eric noted how the asset has influenced the management of his company, particularly its treasury and payments. This suggests that Bitcoin strongly impacts people's financial strategy and operations. Comparison Between Bitcoin and Email Furthermore, Eric drew a parallel between Bitcoin and Email, suggesting that neither achieved massive adoption in their early days. He is not surprised that Bitcoin has not gained widespread adoption, as it took 25 years for the world to fully embrace emails. He pointed out that people are usually slow to adopt new technologies. However, he expects Bitcoin to achieve widespread adoption in the future. No Weekend Problem The son of the U.S. President-elect highlighted another key feature of Bitcoin, which allows people to trade the asset round the clock. While the stock market closes on weekends and public holidays, Eric emphasized that he can conveniently trade Bitcoin at any time, including at midnight on Saturday. Early Bitcoin Adopters Will Win With Eric predicting Bitcoin's surge to $1 million, he emphasized that people who adopt the premier asset early will be the winners. Nonetheless, he encouraged traditional financial institutions to join the digital revolution by adopting Bitcoin now. The price of Bitcoin has rallied significantly following Donald Trump's re-election, as investors hope he will fulfill his campaign promise for the industry. Some of the promises include creating a national Bitcoin reserve, establishing fair and transparent regulation for the industry, and preventing the creation of a CBDC in America. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $98,044, up 0.67% over the past 24 hours.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/11/here-are-7-key-points-donald-trumps-son-eric-made-about-bitcoin/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=here-are-7-key-points-donald-trumps-son-eric-made-about-bitcoin,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
37500138,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=660576,1733913011,Dogecoin Enters ‘Full Breakdown Mode’: How Low Can DOGE Go?,"The Dogecoin (DOGE) price is showing signs of pronounced weakness after a major price surge over the past two days. At one point on Monday and Tuesday combined, DOGE prices fell more than 21%. Following a remarkable rally since October 10—during which the memecoin surged over 360%—Dogecoin reached $0.4834 on December 8, the highest price since May 2021. However, strong downward pressure has since emerged. How Low Can Dogecoin Price Go? The current technical landscape suggests DOGE is at a critical juncture. Crypto analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) shared his perspective on X with a daily DOGE/USD chart, commenting: “Dogecoin is in full breakdown mode. Everyone with their triangle kept saying that DOGE was breaking out but as the Doge lead analyst I was able to identify that on the macro linear chart Doge was actually right at its biggest points of résistance that being the macro golden pocket. I warned everyone that this was not the place to feel over exuberant and a major pullback was on the table. You’re welcome.” Kevin has previously highlighted the “golden pocket”—a zone defined by key Fibonacci retracement levels (the .703 and the .786), located in the $0.47-$0.60 range—as a critical resistance area. This region needed to be decisively overcome for DOGE to have a chance at reaching new all-time highs. The recent downturn suggests this resistance has held firm. Related Reading: Dogecoin Defies Crypto Market Crash: Analyst Says It Looks ‘Incredible’ Compounding the bearish case, the Dogecoin price recently broke below a rising trend line that had supported its advance over the past month. This trend line failure indicates a shift in market dynamics. When a price chart breaks below such a line, it frequently suggests that the buying pressure once driving the asset higher is waning. Traders may interpret this breach as a cue to take profits, exit long positions, or consider short setups. Another technical indicator supporting a bearish outlook is the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart. The RSI has been trending downward over the past month, even as DOGE continued making higher highs. This classic bearish divergence—where price action and momentum indicators move in opposite directions—often precedes reversals. The recent move below the supporting price trend line, coupled with the RSI line breaking its own uptrend, confirms that the momentum may have decisively shifted to the downside. Related Reading: Don’t Be Surprised If Dogecoin Hits $1 Or $2 ‘In A Hurry’, Says Crypto Analyst As for potential downside targets, Kevin’s chart suggests that DOGE could drop into the $0.29-$0.26 region. Meanwhile, a closer look at the Fibonacci retracement levels on the daily chart provides a roadmap of possible support zones. Currently, the 0.5 Fib retracement at $0.39 appears to be a key battleground. A successful defense of this level might halt the bearish trend and even set the stage for a bounce back above the broken trend line. However, a daily close below the 0.5 Fib would likely open the door to deeper retracements. Under such circumstances, DOGE could target the 0.382 Fib at $0.31 and even the 0.236 Fib at $0.21 as the next potential support levels if the selling momentum accelerates. On the lower time frames, the 4-hour 200 EMA is currently the crucial support to hold.

As Bitcoin's price experiences a short-term recovery, hovering around the $97,000-$98,000 mark, altcoins are quickly bouncing back. Among the top-performing altcoins, Raydium leads the way with a 7.68% rise over the past 24 hours.Surpassing a $1.5 billion market cap, Raydium is currently trading at $5.20. Will this recovery rally push Raydium to a new all-time high beyond the $6.50 level?Raydium Price AnalysisOn the daily chart, Raydium's price action shows a strong rally, followed by a pullback. However, the bullish recovery has absorbed the pullback range, which extended from $6.50 to the $4.43 support level.This pullback represented a nearly 32% drop over 17 days. However, the bullish momentum has picked up with an overnight surge of 10.36%, followed by a 6.02% intraday gain. Raydium has surpassed the psychological $5 mark and is currently trading at $5.20. This increases the likelihood of a bull run towards the immediate trend-based Fibonacci level of 23.6% at $5.65.Additionally, the MACD and signal lines on the 4-hour chart are preparing for a bullish crossover, supporting the chances of a continued turnaround. On the daily chart, trend-based Fibonacci levels project the recovery rally to reach the 50% Fibonacci level at $7.01, potentially setting a new all-time high by the end of December.Raydium Channel Breakout RallyOn the 4-hour chart, Raydium's pullback phase forms a falling channel pattern. The ongoing recovery has led to a V-shaped reversal rally, breaking above the resistance trendline. Based on pivot levels, the bullish rally is approaching the $5.33 R1 pivot resistance level. Furthermore, Raydium's price trend has created eight consecutive bullish candles amid the V-shaped recovery.Thus, the Raydium recovery suggests a possibility of reaching the pinnacle of the falling channel pattern. This peak stands at $6.50, slightly above the R4 pivot level of $6.34.

According to data from Farside Investors, daily inflows into spot Ethereum ( ETH ) ETFs in the U.S. surged to $305.74 million, bringing cumulative inflows to an impressive $1.87 billion. This substantial growth occurred despite Ethereum price experiencing a 7% decline over the past three days. These investment products saw their highest cumulative weekly inflow last week. Interestingly, inflows have been consistently positive throughout December, confirming strong institutional interest. For instance, Dec. 6 recorded $83.76 million in inflows, while Dec. 5 saw an even higher figure of $428.44 million, marking a new ATH in net inflows. The total net assets now stand at $12.46 billion, marking an addition of $1.33 billion in December alone. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s price is currently in a delicate position. The asset is trading within an ascending broadening wedge pattern, a formation that typically signals potential volatility.

Despite the downward action, the altcoin king maintains its position within the wedge. Notably, the Fibonacci retracement levels show key zones of support and resistance. Ethereum is currently testing the 78.6% level at $3,718. If the price fails to sustain this level, the next support lies at the 61.8% retracement of $3,425. On the upside, breaking above $3,718 could pave the way for a move toward $4,091, the next critical resistance level. Further, with the Directional Movement Index, the +DI has dropped to 22.1, while the -DI has risen to 20.6, signaling increasing bearish pressure. Meanwhile, the ADX stands at 37.4. A sustained drop in the +DI alongside a rising -DI could flip the momentum decisively bearish. Despite these bearish signals , Ethereum’s overall trend remains upward. The ascending wedge pattern’s lower boundary currently acts as a vital support level. A breakdown below this trendline would signal a bearish reversal and could prompt a retest of lower support zones such as $3,220 or $3,014.

According to a Chosun report, a South Korean National Assembly official spoke out about the fate of the country’s crypto regulations that are still in the works. The report indicated that all crypto-related policies “have been buried under the impeachment issue, making it impossible to expect a vote.” The unnamed official stated that the public should expect “an indefinite postponement” for bills related to virtual assets at least until “the impeachment situation is over.” The report predicted that discussions regarding all crypto-related regulations will resume in the first half of 2025. “Since martial law has taken all the attention of the National Assembly, it is difficult to say but we should deal with this first, even though there are many bills related to virtual assets,” said the official. The bills in question include South Korea’s initial coin offering ban, the issuance of real-name accounts for crypto trading, the decision to give local companies permission to add cryptocurrencies to their balance sheets, Bitcoin ( BTC ) spot ETF approval, and a legislation on securities token offering. You might also like: South Korean martial law catapults crypto trading volume to new record high with $34b One bill that barely escaped the martial law aftermath is the proposal to delay the crypto tax law to 2027. The bill was debated over on Dec. 4 and received a majority vote in the National Assembly on Dec. 10, the last day of regular sessions before the council went into “full impeachment mode.” If the National Assembly had not agreed on the bill by Dec. 10, the crypto tax law would have come into effect on Jan. 1, 2025. In addition, the South Korean Financial Services Commission is taking a similar approach. The FSC had recently finalized the guidelines needed for corporate accounts based on advice from the Virtual Asset Committee and is set to be implemented within this month. However, after the chaos fueled by the martial law, financial authorities have decided to push back on virtual assets and prioritize traditional financial markets, such as stocks, bonds, short-term funds, and foreign currency funds. The crypto industry in South Korea have long pressed for more regulations that accommodate crypto trading for individuals and corporations, criticizing the nation’s lack of clear guidelines and protection. With the issue of crypto laws being set aside indefinitely by the government, South Korea risks falling behind other countries like the U.S and Hong Kong that are accelerating their crypto regulation frameworks. As a result, the report indicated a growing concern that the martial law situation could drive domestic crypto firms and investors to move overseas.

Take a closer look at… pic.twitter.com/TQl0v4sCPY — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 10, 2024 The Multi-Year ‘W’ Pattern Egrag Crypto identifies a multi-year “W” pattern in XRP’s price chart, emphasizing its significance in determining future price movements. XRP recently retested a critical breakout point at the Fibonacci 1 level, approximately $1.96. This level, described as one of the most pivotal in XRP’s price history, marks a key turning point for the asset. The chart highlights XRP’s long journey since 2018, demonstrating how the asset’s price has adhered to this long-term formation. The analyst notes that this measured move excludes around 30% of the wick from the March 2020 crash, suggesting that factoring in this omitted data could result in even greater upside potential. Fibonacci Levels and Price Targets Egrag Crypto points to specific Fibonacci retracement levels as benchmarks for XRP’s growth. The next “pit stop” is identified at the 1.618 Fibonacci level ($6.45), followed by targets at 1.414 ($13.52) and 1.618 ($27.05). These levels are presented as key stages for XRP’s continued upward momentum, contingent upon sustained bullish sentiment and market conditions. The analysis encourages traders and investors to focus on the bigger picture rather than short-term fluctuations, urging them not to “miss the forest for the trees.” This sentiment reflects the importance of XRP’s long-term potential over immediate price volatility. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Investor Sentiment and Call to Action Egrag Crypto concludes the analysis with a strong message to the XRP community . He said the most optimistic investors may not fully grasp the asset’s future potential. The tweet encourages the XRP community to remain steadfast, confident, and patient, emphasizing the importance of staying committed during pivotal market movements. For XRP enthusiasts and investors, this chart and commentary is a roadmap to navigate the current market phase. As XRP retests critical resistance levels, the coming months will likely determine whether this multi-year “W” pattern fulfills its bullish promise or faces challenges in breaking through key price points.

Retiring Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das shared his vision of how this digital currency could reshape the country’s economy, where the CBDC plays a crucial role. Das’s Push for Digital Rupee During his farewell speech on December 10, Das spoke confidently about the power of the digital rupee to change the way people make payments. He noted that digital currency could eventually replace paper money, creating a more efficient system for transactions. The RBI has already taken steps towards this goal by launching pilot projects, setting India apart as one of the pioneers in CBDC development. Das took pride in the RBI’s pioneering role in CBDC development, stating, “RBI, among the central banks, is a pioneer.” Unlike many global counterparts still experimenting with digital currencies, the RBI has already launched a pilot project for the digital rupee. Careful Approach Towards CBDCs Although Das is excited about the future of CBDCs , he also cautioned that their launch should be slow and steady. He explained that more research is needed before using a digital currency across the country. Das thinks CBDCs could be very helpful, not only for payments in India but also for transactions between countries. The RBI is already expanding its payment platform, which works with countries like Sri Lanka, Bhutan, and Nepal. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : WazirX Bankruptcy Rumors: Is Nischal Shetty Going to Ditch?

Pseudonymous Dave the Wave tells his 147,000 followers on the social media platform X that a sudden 55% rally for BTC wouldn’t be anything out of the ordinary. Based on a chart shared with his followers, the trader appears to suggest that BTC has been trading within a large ascending broadening wedge, with an upper bound near $150,000 if tapped by April. “A BTC move to $150,000 this southern summer would not be extraordinary…” Source: Dave the Wave/X Zooming in on the short term, Dave the Wave says that BTC is trading in a smaller ascending channel, currently trading near the support on the lower bound. “BTC shorter-term channel holding up so far…” Source: Dave the Wave/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $96,477. Dave the Wave is also bullish on altcoins, noting that Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D), which measures how much of the digital asset market belongs to BTC, appears ready to break down, implying a jump in altcoins. The trader’s chart suggests that BTC.D has fallen out of a bearish ascending wedge while also hitting a diagonal resistance level at around the 57% level. “BTC dom.

37500994,https://cryptonews.com/?p=318630,1733911995,Japanese Crypto Exchange Operator Coincheck Debuts on Nasdaq,"Japanese Coincheck Group, the parent company of the crypto exchange operator Coincheck, announced that it has been publicly listed on the Nasdaq Global Market. The exchange becomes the second regulated crypto firm to debut on Nasdaq, after Coinbase’s listing in 2021. The Japanese crypto exchange obtained US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Form F-4 approval in November. This means that the regulator reviewed the submitted documents and approved that they meet the legal listing requirements. The filing had mentioned the “risks” involved, including price fluctuations inherent to the crypto markets and the uncertain regulatory landscape. The listing was slated for completion in mid-December after the company’s merger with SPAC Thunder Bridge IV. Thunder Bridge noted that Coincheck would “retain its experienced management team,” including Oki Matsumoto as the executive chairman. Coincheck shares will begin trading on Nasdaq under the ticker “CNCK” from December 11, 2024, the exchange’s official release read. Following the listing, Coincheck (CCG) will leverage its strength “to further expand its cryptocurrency/web3 business through global recruitment, acquisitions, and capital and business alliances.” “Going forward, as a core company of CCG listed on NASDAQ, we will focus more than ever on expanding the possibilities of cryptocurrency, a new means of value exchange,” Satoshi Hasuo, CEO of Coincheck, noted. Coincheck was founded in 2012 and entered crypto trading in 2014, gaining prominence for its user-friendly interface. Besides, several Japanese crypto exchanges apart from Coincheck, have unveiled their plans for global expansion, including DMM , Bitbank and bitFlyer. Nasdaq’s Crypto Exchanges Listing So Far In 2021, Coinbase became the first crypto exchange to debut on the US stock market. Coinbase opted for a direct listing rather than a traditional IPO. The following year, crypto service provider Bakkt went public but chose the New York Stock Exchange for its listing. The Korean Economic Daily, in September 2024, reported that South Korean crypto exchange Bithumb is considering a listing on Nasdaq . The exchange had a target of 2025 and selected Samsung Securities as its manager for the initial public offering.

The tweet suggests that a Kraken listing could be on the way. A mysterious post recently made on X by the official account of MAGA Memecoin has set off a breakout of TRUMP ( TRUMP ), a token in the MAGA ecosystem. The post claimed that Kraken, a well-known cryptocurrency exchange, is interested in listing the token and caused ripples in the token community. The post included a photo showing Kraken branding adjacent to the caption, “Whose ready?” sparking speculation about the token’s listing on the exchange. Steven Steele , MAGA Marketing Exec, stoked the hype even more. However, neither Kraken nor the MAGA team has released an official statement on the listing.

TRUMP’s appearance on the list could signal an imminent listing, especially as MAGA ‘s marketing team is gearing up for some action. TRUMP has started to pump with community engagement Recent price action shows increasing interest in the TRUMP token, as there has been a decline in transfer count after Dec. 8., anticipating people in the community to expect a Kraken listing. Coupled with this, a significant divergence has been seen between active addresses and the price of the TRUMP token, since Dec. 9. As the price dropped from Dec. 9 to Dec. 10, the number of active addresses started to rise again after a short dip.

Newly opened addresses signal an expanding user base, demonstrating increased community interest in the token. At the same time, the ever-present holders are still playing well with their coins, whether it be trading, staking, or something else. This correlation between new and active addresses indicates that TRUMP is not only drawing fresh attention but also sustaining activity within its own community.

The altcoins are still mostly in the red, aside from XRP, SOL, and TON, from the larger caps, which have posted impressive gains. BTC Targets $98K BTC’s inability to decisively conquer the $100,000 level during the weekend resulted in a few consecutive leg downs that harmed the asset’s price movements. It all started on Monday when BTC went to a daily high of $100,400 but just hours later found itself dumping to under $94,400. After leaving billions of dollars in liquidations, the cryptocurrency started to recover on Tuesday and spiked to $98,400. However, the same scenario repeated once again as BTC slumped hard to the same support level of $94,400. Since then, the asset has been recovering, surging to $94,400 once again hours ago. Nevertheless, it has been unable to continue its upswing, and now the community wonders whether another rejection will follow.

Solana, Toncoin, and Shiba Inu are the other notable gainers from the larger-cap alts. In contrast, DOGE, ETH, BNB, AVAX, and TRX are in the red. PEPE has slumped ever harder, dropping by 7% from its latest all-time high. Bitget’s native token is today’s top performer, having surged by over 22% in the past 24 hours.

37499215,https://coinpedia.org/?p=391766,1733911258,Magic Eden ME Token Airdrop: A $700 Million Event Ends in Price Plunge,"The post Magic Eden ME Token Airdrop: A $700 Million Event Ends in Price Plunge appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The ME token airdrop from Magic Eden NFT marketplace , valued at approximately $700 million, created extreme excitement in the crypto industry yesterday. Minutes before the launch, ME saw its price spiking from $6.04 to a peak of $8.9. Some earned massive profits from the launch. But for many, it was simply disappointing. Why? Airdrop’s Massive Participation & ME Price’s Surge and Drop: What You Should Know The ME token airdrop was one of the largest events from the cryptocurrency sector in the year 2024. The ME Foundation confirms that at least 70,000 users claimed over 69 million ME tokens within the first hour of the launch. At a point yesterday, the price of ME touched a peak of $17.00. It took no time for the market to face a massive drop of around 73.88%. In the last 24-hours, the ME price has declined by nearly 69%. In the last hour alone, the price slipped by around 5.9%. Data indicate that those who benefited from the launch were the ones who claimed their tokens early. Challenges in the ME Airdrop Claim Process Why could many users not properly time the market? To claim tokens, users were supposed to download the Magic Eden Wallet app, scan a QR code, and maintain a minimum wallet balance of $10. Reports suggest that not many were able to complete the process in a timely manner as they faced serious technical errors. Shockingly, reports also note that some even got confirmations without the actual tokens being awarded. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : What the Crypto MDIA Trends for Bitcoin, XRP, and Dogecoin Reveal , Users’ Creative Strategies to Earn ME Tokens When many users dropped the attempt after facing errors during the claim process, some used creative strategies, like exploring fee mechanisms, to overcome the problem. Market Lessons from ME and HYPE Airdrops Experts point out that the airdrop of Magic Eden mirrored the HYPE event of Hyperliquid . They note that in both the scenarios, initial excitement slowly faded due to price drops. There are many who strongly believe that Magic Eden is far different from Hyperliquid. If Magic Eden puts effort into building utility and trust, the price of ME could go up again – even beyond the peak of $17. In conclusion, the ME airdrop showcased Magic Eden’s popularity but highlighted the challenges of large-scale crypto airdrops. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

37499287,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=625866,1733910822,OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar calls Trump the ‘president of this AI generation’,"Sarah Friar, Chief Financial Officer of OpenAI, said President-elect Donald Trump could be “president of this AI generation” as he will take over office just when the key foundation for artificial general intelligence is being laid. Sarah Friar joined OpenAI as the company’s first CFO six months ago after a stint with Nextdoor. In an interview at the ReutersNEXT conference, she said Trump would be the “President of this AI generation.” Friar says he will be at the beginning of AGI progression in which technology can outperform human capabilities across the most valuable tasks. She also waved off any strong warnings against OpenAI from Elon Musk, a close Trump adviser. Friar said that she trusts Musk, a competitor, to respect national interests and play fair. Musk, a co-founder of OpenAI, has consistently disagreed with changes at the company that whittled down the nonprofit board’s control. Since then, he has gone on to become a top adviser to Trump during the transition and is now heading up a rival artificial intelligence firm, xAI. Musk, along with entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, will lead a team of Trump’s choosing in an effort to reduce government spending and waste. OpenAI CFO expects technology advancement to surprise people Friar added that OpenAI’s newly launched video tool, Sora, caused a big stir during the launch week. She also said that new account sign-ups were put on hold after its release and did not say when they would resume. She said part of the reason is the need for more capacity. Another is caution—the tool is only being used by a tiny fraction of customers, so the company can “listen and learn.” She added that this is a different approach from how it handled ChatGPT. Fiar said, “There are places where we will go a little slower to make sure that we are constantly putting safety first as well.” OpenAI is expected to roll out more AI agents or autonomous tools assisted by base models with better reasoning capabilities for everyday tasks. These tools could hit the market in the upcoming year. Friar added that people will be surprised by how fast technology advances. She also thinks there will be a lot of progress next year. The fast-growing company has shown a renewed commitment to consolidating its relationships with its most prominent backer and tech partner, Microsoft.

Speaking on the Matt Kohrs Show, he expressed optimism about Bitcoin's potential due to the favorable macroeconomic environment and the growing interest in digital assets. Data from financial research firm Luthold Group suggests that riskier assets including Bitcoin and gold are likely to outperform traditional 60/40 stock and bond portfolios through 2024. Kohrs, known for his in-depth study of market trends, laid out two potential scenarios for the future of Bitcoin: It solidifies itself as the best store of value ever produced. It collapses in a bubble similar to historical speculative manias. But Kohrs remains bullish, arguing that BTC will likely continue to climb. “I don’t think there’s any middle ground,” he said, adding: “It’s either going to zero or we’re going to continue to climb higher.” Kohrs told participants to adopt a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy by regularly purchasing small amounts of Bitcoin regardless of price fluctuations. He noted that the devaluation of the US dollar, combined with Bitcoin’s limited supply, makes BTC an attractive long-term investment. Related News: JUST IN: Coinbase Announces the Listing of Two New Altcoins “I always speculate that the US dollar will fall,” he said, noting that Bitcoin’s rise is related to the dollar falling rather than the asset’s intrinsic value increasing. Looking ahead, Kohrs identified $250,000 as the next major psychological turning point for Bitcoin, which he predicted could occur within the next calendar year. Key catalysts include regulatory clarity and a growing overall cryptocurrency market cap, which he predicts could reach $2.5 trillion. *This is not investment advice.

Most altcoins are also projected to experience a downtrend through early 2025. Bitcoin is also still volatile, but analysts predict possible short squeezes and upward moves in Q1 of 2025. Meanwhile, Bitwise's 2025 predictions were revealed earlier today, and suggest that Bitcoin could surpass $200,000. Bitwise also thinks it is possible for Ethereum to reach $7,000 next year, while the stablecoin market could expand to $400 billion. Ethereum's Path to $5000 Faces Uncertainty Ethereum's potential to reach the very anticipated $5,000 milestone by the end of 2024 seems very slim, according to data from on-chain options protocol Derive . Despite decent inflows into spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which hint at a looming “supply-side crisis,” the likelihood of ETH hitting the target dropped significantly. Sean Dawson, Derive’s head of research, revealed in a Dec. 10 market report that the probability of ETH reaching $5,000 by Dec. 27 peaked at 16% but has since declined to just over 8%. CoinMarketCap data shows ETH will need a 37% surge from its current price to achieve this target. ETH’s probability of hitting $5K before the end of 2024 (Source: Derive ) However, not everyone shares this cautious outlook. Pseudonymous crypto trader CoinMamba shared in a Dec. 10 post on X that they are still optimistic that ETH could hit $5,000 by year-end. Adding to the bullish sentiment, Ethereum contributor Eric Conner pointed out the $305 million in daily inflows into Ether ETFs on Dec. 10, and believes this is evidence of an impending supply shortage. Ethereum educator Anthony Sassano agreed with this, and shared that traditional finance institutions are “gobbling up the cheap ETH.” The Fidelity Ethereum Fund accounted for $202.2 million of these inflows, according to data from Farside . The conversation around Ethereum’s price potential also drew some attention from more well known voices in the crypto community. Bankless podcast host Ryan Adams suggested on Dec. 9 that ETH could hit a new all-time high within a week. The current ETH high was set in November of 2021, and stands at $4,878. Meanwhile, crypto trader Pentoshi shared ETH's structural changes in a Dec. 9 post. They also revealed that ETH recently achieved its highest weekly close of the year and predicted that a retest of its all-time high could happen sooner than expected. Overall, the outlook for ETH is uncertain. While bullish traders foresee a potential breakout, the data-driven perspective suggests a more tempered trajectory for the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. Altcoins Face Prolonged Downtrend Not just Ethereum, but the altcoin market in general appears to be facing continued downward pressure. In fact, the majority of tokens will very likely remain in a downtrend until the end of January of 2025, according to Felix Hartmann , the founder of Hartmann Capital. In a Dec. 10 X post, Hartmann stated that while some altcoins might experience brief upward movements, the overall trend for most will involve slow bleeding or consolidation over the next two to six weeks. Hartmann advised traders against chasing recent altcoin gains, as many already peaked after dramatic 2–3x surges in a week. Despite the bearish outlook for altcoins, Hartmann is still cautiously optimistic about the broader market. He suggested that it might be a reasonable time to reintroduce a long bias, as waiting for further ideal levels might result in missed opportunities. His comments were made after a huge decline in the altcoin market, which saw approximately $481.6 million in long positions liquidated over 24 hours, according to data from CoinGlass . Crypto trader Mister Crypto suggested that the latest market dip could be the “final shakeout” before exponential breakouts. Among the top 100 cryptocurrencies, some of the largest declines hit tokens like Ethena (ENA), Pepe (PEPE), and Bonk (BONK) , according to CoinMarketCap . Bitcoin also saw some heightened volatility. At press time, BTC was trading hands at $97,996.69 after its price managed a slight 0.65% climb over the past 24 hours. The crypto has also stayed below the $100,000 psychological threshold since Dec. 9, despite reaching six figures for the first time on Dec. 5. Hartmann believes that Bitcoin has a “fair chance” of retesting $99,000, mainly due to the potential for short squeezes. If Bitcoin were to climb the 2+% above the $99,000 level, around $1.53 billion in short positions could face liquidation. Market participants are, however, still divided on the path forward. CryptoSea co-founder Daan de Rover hinted that major developments could be around the corner for the Bitcoin market, and stated, “We all know what’s next.” Meanwhile, Daan Crypto Trades pointed out Bitcoin’s historical patterns of moving 30–50% after long periods of consolidation. He suggested that the next consolidation phase could be shorter than usual, and could also set the stage for a new upward leg in Q1. For now, it seems like traders adopted a short-term mindset during this cycle, according to Syncracy Capital co-founder Daniel Cheung . Crypto analysis firm Santiment also warned that retail traders reacting fearfully and selling off their crypto too quickly could paradoxically trigger a sharp recovery. Bitwise Reveals Its Crypto Predictions for 2025 Bitwise released its 2025 crypto predictions , and projected some groundbreaking milestones for Bitcoin, tokenized assets, and regulatory advancements. The report forecasts that Bitcoin’s price could surpass $200,000 in 2025, and even has the potential to exceed $500,000 if the U.S. government establishes a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoins. Ethereum and Solana are also expected to see impressive growth, with projections of Ethereum reaching $7,000 and Solana (SOL) climbing to $750. As the market matures, Bitcoin ETFs are expected to experience record-breaking inflows, surpassing even the high 2024 levels. These inflows will likely be driven by increased regulatory clarity and institutional interest. Sovereign adoption of Bitcoin is also expected to rise, with the number of countries holding the cryptocurrency predicted to double. The report suggests that the U.S.’s consideration of a strategic Bitcoin reserve could spark a global race among governments to accumulate Bitcoin before scarcity drives prices even higher. In the broader industry, Bitwise projects that Coinbase’s stock will soar above $700 per share, fueled by widespread crypto adoption and its growing dominance in the market. The company is expected to surpass Charles Schwab as the most valuable brokerage and join the S&P 500. MicroStrategy is also predicted to enter the Nasdaq-100 by 2025. Bitwise anticipates at least five crypto unicorns going public in the U.S. as well, and named Circle, Figure, Kraken, Anchorage, and Chainalysis as top IPO candidates. The stablecoin market is expected to expand a lot, too, and could reach $400 billion in assets, supported by anticipated U.S. legislation offering a clearer regulatory framework. Looking further ahead, Bitwise predicts Bitcoin will surpass gold’s $18 trillion market cap by 2029, trading above $1 million per coin.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,ALTCOIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6487/data-shows-low-odds-for-ethereum-reaching-5000-by-year-end,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

Justin Sun ridiculed the company’s decision of watching BTC grow on the sidelines. Donald Trump wants Bitcoin at $150,000 during his presidency. Microsoft’s Bitcoin rejection has drawn criticism from the digital asset community after shareholders voted against a proposal to invest in Bitcoin. Titled “ Assessment of Investing in Bitcoin ,” the proposal was to allocate 1% of Microsoft’s total assets into Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. Despite the rising interest in corporate cryptocurrency adoption, Microsoft’s board opposed the proposal, citing Bitcoin’s volatility and the need to prioritize stable investments for liquidity and operational funding. Critics argue that this conservative stance may result in missed opportunities, especially as companies like MicroStrategy continue to embrace Bitcoin.

They unveiled collaboration during the Abu Dhabi Finance Week. The recently announced alliance reportedly is part of Binance’s strategy, as the world’s largest crypto exchange by user base, to integrate Circle’s stablecoin, USD Coin (USDC), into its corporate treasury and suite of services. #Binance is thrilled to announce a strategic partnership with @Circle to enhance our ecosystem and bring more value to our users. Stay tuned for more updates! $USDC Read more here ⤵️ https://t.co/toHpPg70ta pic.twitter.com/cVTkrI8oGF — Binance (@binance) December 11, 2024 Circle is expected to benefit from Binance’s extensive user base of 240 million customers who could potentially use its USDC for trading, saving, and transactions. Through this collaboration, Circle could provide advanced tools and liquidity while also supplying innovative technology to enhance user trust and facilitate broader adoption of digital assets. The partnership signals Binance’s departure from its traditionally limited stablecoin offerings, which have largely focused on Tether (USDT) and FUSD. Circle seeks to leverage Binance’s large user base Circle’s CEO, Jeremy Allaire, lauded Binance’s approach to innovation and its focus on user experience. “ I have long admired Binance for their relentless commitment to product quality, innovation, and user-centricity, which is evident in their massive and loyal global community of more than 240 million users, ” he said. Binance CEO Richard Teng echoed these sentiments, emphasizing the partnership’s transformative potential. “ This collaboration will materially advance the rapidly maturing digital financial system, ” Teng stated. USDC’s integration into Binance’s ecosystem aligns with the exchange’s efforts to enhance its regulatory compliance and position itself as a leader in the stablecoin market. For Binance, the partnership also represents an opportunity to expand its influence in the global financial and commercial sectors, with Circle playing a key role in fostering these connections. Seeking to rival Tether’s dominance The partnership comes at a critical juncture for the stablecoin market, which is undergoing significant shifts. While Tether’s USDT has long dominated the sector, boasting a market capitalization of $138 billion compared to USDC’s $40 billion, cracks have begun to appear in Tether’s dominance. The company’s decision not to comply with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations has created opportunities for competitors like USDC to gain traction, particularly in the EU bloc. Despite its reputation as one of the most regulated and transparent stablecoins, USDC has struggled to achieve market dominance over Tether’s USDT. However, the collaboration with Binance could be a turning point. By integrating USDC across its services, the exchange is looking to provide a platform for the stablecoin issuer to increase its market presence and compete with Tether. Circle, known for its focus on regulatory compliance and transparency, offers the leading crypto exchange a stable and compliant alternative in an environment increasingly shaped by regulatory scrutiny. This strategic alignment could allow USDC to challenge Tether’s long-standing supremacy in the stablecoin industry. Jeremy Allaire highlighted the significance of stablecoin adoption in the partnership’s announcement, describing it as “core to the future financial system.” Circle’s focus on compliance and innovation positions USDC as a preferred choice for exchanges looking to adapt to evolving regulations, particularly in key markets like the European Union. Binance to bolster strength as a key industry player Through its partnership with Circle, Binance could further enhance its ability to maintain market dominance while offering its users a compliant and transparent stablecoin alternative. The collaboration is expected to strengthen Binance’s reputation as a leader in the crypto industry, particularly as it works to meet the demands of an evolving regulatory environment. Circle and Binance also revealed significant developments during Abu Dhabi Finance Week. The former announced the establishment of an entity within the Abu Dhabi Global Market and a partnership with LuLu Financial Holdings to streamline cross-border payments and remittances using USDC.

President-elect Donald Trump recently announced the nomination of pro-crypto Paul Atkins to chair the US SEC after Gary Gensler announced the end of his tenure. However, Commissioner Crenshaw has faced some heat from the crypto industry as they have labeled her even more anti-crypto than Gensler. Ripple’s CLO slams SEC’s Crenshaw Stuart Alderoty, in an X post, agreed that “Crenshaw is, in some ways, even more rogue than Gensler.” He mentioned that Gary Gensler backed down after a court declared that blocking Bitcoin (BTC) spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) was “arbitrary and capricious.” Ripple’s CLO stated that Crenshaw continued to vote “no” and insisted that the court got it wrong in her dissent. He expressed his sentiment over the situation and declared that “Unelected bureaucrats are not above the law.” Data shows that the freshly launched Bitcoin ETFs have added more than 1.1 million BTC. This tally has exceeded the holdings of the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto. The biggest of them all, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) holds $51.5 billion worth of Bitcoins. It owns nearly 528K BTC. Grayscale’s Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) and the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) both hold between 241k BTC. KING OF THE HILL: The US spot ETFs have just passed Satoshi in total bitcoin held, now hold more than 1.1m, more than anyone in the world, and they’re not even a year old yet, literally babies still.

The cumulative digital assets market cap stands at $3.45 trillion with a trading volume of $276 billion. Crypto groups push to block the re-nomination As Crenshaw faces a Senate Banking Committee hearing on her re-nomination, crypto lobbying groups are urging lawmakers to reject her. Groups like the Blockchain Association have cited her strong anti-crypto stance. In a post, the Blockchain Association brought up that divergence in perspective on regulatory matters integral to crypto in the country is more troubling. It mentioned that Crenshaw was out of step with the prior Congress and will be even more so with the 119th. The group urged the Senate to reject this nomination and asked for an SEC leadership that is aligned with Congress and the Commissioner in good faith. Crenshaw is set to become the SEC’s lone Democrat next year. She has labeled crypto markets as a “petri dish of fraud.” Meanwhile, Senators stand in a split as Sherrod Brown, the outgoing chair of the Senate Banking Committee, has supported stricter crypto regulations. On the other hand, Republican Senator Tim Scott has urged Biden to withdraw all pending nominations.

Meanwhile, Binance has continued to expand its offerings with new listings. The exchange recently launched the Perpetual trading for the popular SPX6900 meme coin. As a tier-1 exchange, listings on Binance are often followed by significant price appreciation for the associated tokens. Lately, meme coins have been among the biggest beneficiaries of this trend. Last month, two Solana-based meme coins, ACT and PNUT, underwent explosive growth following their Binance listings, with their market caps surging by 1,199% and 208%, respectively. In some cases, even the announcement of a Binance listing is enough to send tokens rallying, as was the case with ACX, the native token of Across Protocol, on Dec. 6, which surged roughly 150% after the exchange announced it would list the token.

This brings the whale’s current holdings to 2.69 million WLD, worth approximately $7.52 million. Despite the recent downturn in WLD’s price—down 25.10% in the last 24 hours—the whale remains in profit. The total estimated gain stands at $893,000 (+9.03%), with $293,000 of that already realized. The whale’s activity highlights a calculated approach to trading. Between October 26 and December 10, 2024, they withdrew 3.804 million WLD from OKX at an average price of $2.597, amounting to an estimated $9.88 million in costs.

However, the recent price drop could present new challenges or opportunities for the whale’s trading strategy. WLD’s sharp 25.10% price decline over the past day underscores the heightened volatility in the market. As whale activity often influences token liquidity and sentiment, this latest move may have contributed to the downward pressure on WLD. With significant holdings and a clear profit-driven approach, whale 0xad7 remains a key player in the WLD market. Their ongoing activity will likely continue to attract attention as traders monitor the impact on price movements and market stability. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

37498434,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51876,1733907794,Hoskinson Discusses Cardano and XRP Collaboration With Ripple CEO and CTO,"Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has shared fresh insights into potential collaboration opportunities between the Cardano and XRP ecosystems. Speaking during an interview on the Cardano-focused YouTube channel Big Pey, Hoskinson disclosed details about his recent discussions with Ripple executives Brad Garlinghouse and David Schwartz. Hoskinson described the meeting as constructive, marking a notable improvement in their relationship. He emphasized that both parties have moved past prior tensions, fostering an atmosphere conducive to meaningful dialogue. Exploring a Partnership Between Cardano and XRP The discussions centered on the distinctive roles that Cardano and XRP play within the broader cryptocurrency space and possible synergies between the two ecosystems. According to Hoskinson, the conversation delved into areas where collaboration could promote innovation and wider adoption of blockchain technologies. Key elements of the proposed partnership include leveraging Cardano’s Midnight and Marlowe technologies. Midnight is a privacy-focused sidechain within the Cardano ecosystem, while Marlowe provides a suite of tools designed to simplify the creation of smart contracts on Cardano. XRP’s Potential Role in Midnight and Marlowe Hoskinson revealed that XRP could be integrated into Cardano’s Midnight sidechain, potentially enhancing the platform’s overall utility. Midnight operates on a dual-token model featuring two core tokens: NIGHT, used for transactions, and DUST, the governance and staking token. If realized, XRP could become a third token within the Midnight framework, offering alternative functionality. Hoskinson suggested that XRP could serve as a supplementary transaction token, though he clarified that these plans are yet to be finalized. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 In addition to Midnight, the integration of XRP with Marlowe was also explored. Hoskinson hinted that Marlowe might align better with XRP’s use case compared to ADA, Cardano’s native cryptocurrency. Cardano’s Interest in Ripple Stablecoin Beyond Midnight and Marlowe, Hoskinson expressed interest in Ripple’s upcoming stablecoin, RLUSD. This digital asset, recently approved by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), is set to launch on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and Ethereum. Hoskinson stated that Cardano would like to play a role in the stablecoin’s ecosystem. This could potentially involve Ripple deploying RLUSD on Cardano at a later stage, following its initial launch. A Shift in Relations Between Cardano and Ripple Speculation about collaboration between Cardano and Ripple has been circulating in the crypto community for weeks. The turning point came on November 10, when Hoskinson issued a public apology to the XRP community , signaling an end to years of hostility. Shortly after, Hoskinson met with Garlinghouse and Schwartz to explore opportunities for cooperation. He underscored the importance of moving beyond past conflicts to focus on advancing blockchain technology and creating value for their respective ecosystems. While no official announcements have been made, the discussions between Cardano and Ripple executives hint at promising possibilities for collaboration soon.

This sharp decline points to changing market dynamics surrounding the cryptocurrency. Recent data indicates that 25% of Toncoin wallets are now operating at a loss, while 11% are breaking even. This downturn underscores the heightened market volatility impacting Toncoin’s price, leading to reduced profitability for its holders. A breakdown of wallet ownership reveals that the majority of Toncoin holders—85%—have been invested for less than a year. Among them, 12% acquired the coin within the last month, and only 3% have held Toncoin for over a year. This data highlights a trend of short-term speculation among most investors.

Interestingly, Paul Manafort, former campaign chairman for President-elect Donald Trump, recently expressed optimism for BTC’s upward trajectory during the Bitcoin Mena conference in Abu Dhabi. A New Era For Crypto Awaits Manafort highlighted Trump’s role as a significant supporter of the cryptocurrency market, predicting that Bitcoin will strengthen even more once the President-elect takes office on January 20. He praised Trump’s intent to reform the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve, which he believes will foster a more favorable environment for digital assets. “There are exciting times ahead for investors and participants in the cryptocurrency market,” Manafort stated, adding that those who celebrated Bitcoin’s recent milestone of $100,000 would soon be celebrating even higher prices. Related Reading: Five Weeks, Five Purchases: MicroStrategy Invests Another $2.1 Billion In Bitcoin Manafort’s optimism is rooted in Trump’s recent appointments aimed at creating a more crypto-friendly regulatory framework in the country. Trump has nominated Paul Atkins to lead the SEC, signaling a departure from the current chair, Gary Gensler, who is set to leave his position on January 20. Gensler has been marked, among other things, by regulatory actions that have impeded market acceptance and expansion in the last three years. His resignation could also bring more regulatory clarity to litigation disputes involving Ripple and Coinbase. Additionally, Trump has appointed David Sacks as the inaugural “White House AI & Crypto Czar.” Sacks will be responsible for developing government policies concerning artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. “He will work on a legal framework so the crypto industry gets the clarity it has been asking for and can thrive in the US,” Trump noted regarding Sacks’ role. Since Trump’s election last month, the Bitcoin price has surged nearly 50%, also fueled by increased buying pressure from exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuers, whose total holdings in Bitcoin have now reached approximately $40 billion. Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Could Hit $275,000 Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has also weighed in on Bitcoin’s prospects on social media site X (formerly Twitter), suggesting that it could reach as high as $275,000 based on a bullish cup and handle pattern. Yet, the analyst also cautioned that it is crucial for Bitcoin to hold above $96,000; failure to do so could result in a drop to around $85,000, echoing patterns seen in previous market cycles.

37497333,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/charity-investment-fund-chif-fair-launch-is-coming,1733907561,Charity Investment Fund (CHIF) Fair Launch is Coming,"Amsterdam, Netherlands, December 11th, 2024, Chainwire Charity Investment Fund (CHIF), a blockchain platform driven by the desire to help charitable organisations, is poised to launch fairly to the crypto community soon. This blockchain-powered Fund aims to change the traditional donation paradigm by bridging the gap between investing and donating. What is Charity Investment Fund? Charity Investment Fund makes charity easier by implementing its approach: tying the potential earnings to donations. Users can invest in the native digital currency introduced by CHIF. By doing so, they create new opportunities to earn and participate in a movement aimed at tackling global challenges. This approach, according to the project’s developers, is made to harnesses the investment world and to direct it toward the path of growth. In essence, the goal of CHIF is to create a circular economy with an altruistic end-game. Where investors, incentivised to do good deeds, may come, and in return, donations will continue to be generated. Beneficiaries of this Unique Donation Ecosystem Charity Investment Fund has taken an innovative stand to ensure that everyone is taken care of. 50% of all the proceeds generated from the ecosystem will be distributed among a selection of charitable foundations. These foundations are yet to be affiliated with this initiative. However, Charity Investment Fund will not solely decide on selecting the right recipients by itself. Since CHIF is a community-driven initiative, those who participate in this project will benefit. A poll is available on the website to ensure that all donors, as well as investors, have a say in dictating the direction of where the proceeds go. And since transparency is the goal the organisation is striving to achieve, donors will also receive a detailed report of where the funds eventually end up. CHIF Token - The Core Element of Charity Investment Fund Charity Investment Fund is striving to create a sustainable economy with the CHIF token. Described in the whitepaper as a social impact token, it has been developed on the Binance Smart Chain and a wrapped token (wCHIF) is planned to run on an EVM-compatible blockchain. The latter is a custom blockchain designed to facilitate the donation ecosystem. The EVM-compatible chain will also play a role in Charity Investment Fund's reach. Additionally, the token is audited, which adds another layer of trust to the organisation. This chain will operate on a Proof of Authority consensus mechanism, reducing transaction costs and enhancing processing speed. Furthermore, the chain will enhance security while reducing energy consumption, making Charity Investment Fund an eco-friendly platform as well. CHIF Fair Launch - Giving All an Equal Chance to Grow CHIF will be made available via a fair launch, an event that will start on December 18th, 2024. The token’s fair launch has been designed as an inclusive event, giving everyone a fair chance to invest in this project. Pinksale has been chosen as the portal for people to participate in this fair launch, and token distribution has already been finalised. 51% of the amount generated through the fair launch will go into the liquidity pool. The remaining 49% will be distributed equally among the Charity Investment Fund initiatives and charities. Beyond Fair Launch - Charity Investment Fund’s 50/50 Model Charity Investment Fund has ensured that it continues to adhere to its altruistic goals beyond the fair launch. So, once the initial launch has concluded, CHIF tokens held by Charity Investment Fund will be split 50/50. That means that for any tokens sold by the Fund afterwards, 50% of the proceeds will go to different charitable organisations. 12 organisations have been nominated so far, they include. World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Ukrainian Red Cross Doctors Without Borders (MSF) in Asia-Pacific World Animal Protection US UNICEF Oxfam International Rainforest Alliance Charity: Water Amnesty International American Cancer Society Oceana IFAW As for the remaining 50% of the tokens held by Charity Investment Fund, they will be used to further develop the project. The end goal is to create a charitable platform with a dedicated wallet for each charity. This wallet will store tokens that are tied to a specific charity, creating a trustless system where donations automatically go to the charitable organisations. About Charity Investment Fund Charity Investment Fund is a digital platform that uses blockchain technology to make donating to charitable causes simpler, more transparent, and more sustainable. With its unique 50/50 model, the platform dedicates half of its proceeds and tokens to carefully chosen charities, ensuring meaningful contributions to causes that matter.

We've seen nothing but huge gains from the teams that continuously put in work alongside their community and Koma Inu is one of those teams!… — PinkSale (Pink Ecosystem) (@pinkecosystem) December 10, 2024 Notably, $KOMA is the first project originating from Pinksale to secure a listing on Binance. The @komabnb team initially raised 300 BNB during their token sale on Pinksale, using these funds to facilitate the listing on Binance. DWF Labs appears to have played a significant role in $KOMA’s recent developments. Seven days ago, DWF Labs reportedly became the market maker for $KOMA, receiving 15 million KOMA tokens from the project’s official address. Since then, approximately 1.935 million KOMA tokens—valued at $160,000—have been transferred to centralized exchange (CEX) market makers, including MEXC, Gate, and Bitget, over the past six days. 币安在今天上线了 BSC 上的 Meme 项目 $KOMA 的永续合约。 而 DWF Labs 应该是在 7 天前成为了 $KOMA 的做市商： 他们在 7 天前从 KOMA 地址接收到 1500 万枚 KOMA，并在过去 6 天里将 193.5 万枚 KOMA ($0.16M) 分别转移进 MEXC、Gate、Bitget 等 CEX 做市。 https://t.co/UTW24QqryC 本文由… pic.twitter.com/cP3RqeZW6B — 余烬 (@EmberCN) December 10, 2024 The collaboration with DWF Labs and subsequent distribution of tokens to CEX market makers have likely contributed to the token’s increased visibility and trading activity. With the Binance Futures listing, $KOMA has now entered a new phase of growth, attracting significant attention from the cryptocurrency community. This milestone not only marks a major achievement for $KOMA but also highlights the potential of projects launched through Pinksale. As $KOMA gains traction on major platforms, the cryptocurrency’s performance will likely continue to be closely monitored by investors and traders alike. This surge serves as a testament to the impact of strategic partnerships, market-making efforts, and high-profile listings in driving the success of emerging blockchain projects.

Long-term holders are traditionally defined as those holding Bitcoin for more than 180 days, and many of the early ETF-driven buyers now fall into this category. This shift caused the 6-12 month cohort to grow to 25% of Bitcoin’s wealth by August. Since October, this group has started to shrink, currently holding 16%. This reduction isn’t alarming as it aligns with typical distribution patterns at key price levels and could reflect profit-taking by early Bitcoin ETF buyers. However, the 1-2 and 2-3 year cohorts, representing investors who accumulated during the June-November 2022 bear market, are also reducing their holdings. This could indicate that seasoned investors are taking profits, signaling that the market may be entering a mid-to-late cycle phase. The 3-5 year cohort peaked at around 15.3% in November and now stands at 13.9%, showing early signs of distribution. Despite this, current prices may not yet be compelling enough for these holders to sell in large quantities, leaving some room for further growth. #Bitcoin miners sold 771 $BTC in the last 24 hours, totaling around $76 million! pic.twitter.com/dh8Eg8vEnp — Ali (@ali_charts) December 10, 2024 Meanwhile, Bitcoin miners have sold 771 BTC in the last 24 hours, totaling roughly $76 million.

On the positive side, Bitcoin spot ETFs saw a net inflow of $479 million on December 9, continuing eight consecutive days of inflows, with significant contributions from BlackRock and Fidelity.

The asset already trades in the $500M range, and it has presented a white paper for its development through 2027. CULT, the token of Remilia Corporation, held a high-profile airdrop for the Milady community. Despite the initial airdrop controversy, the asset almost completed its first day of trading with a $500M valuation. At its peak, the Milady Cult Token (CULT) briefly traded above $780M in total market capitalization. After the launch, Remilia Corporation updated its white paper, titled “‘Milady CULT coin declassified.” The paper holds the asset’s main concept, which is based on being a global cult dedicated to holding the main coin as well as Milady NFT. Remilia Corporation increases CULT supply The changes made to the white paper in December increased CULT supply by a factor of 10, adding another zero to the price. CULT will also push back its roadmap by two quarters, with additional airdrops and events until 2027. The CULT token came up with a new message, somewhat resembling the ramblings of Truth Terminal. Underneath the initial nonsense, however, Remilia Corporation was ready with a plan for distributing CULT tokens. The actual distribution will not be entirely democratic, and CULT may end up in whale wallets or insider holdings. Even after the initial airdrop, on-chain analysis identified several high-profile owners. The initial airdrop distributed $270M worth of tokens, with large-scale owners making up the leaderboard. Among the high-profile owners were Stani Kulechov of Aave (AAVE), and Tom Schmidt of Dragonfly Capital. Other high-profile wallets also ended up with tokens worth up to $2.2M. In total, CULT has about 10,994 holders on Ethereum.

The rest will be distributed across three seasons, potentially boosting airdrop farming and engagement. The CULT token initially looked like a fair distribution, similar to other community-owned assets like Pepe (PEPE), Gigachad (GIGA), or SPX6900 (SPX). The token may be launched for the community, but the white paper also suggests a presale event for another 10.5B tokens. This is in addition to a team allocation of another 10.5B CULT with an 18-month vesting schedule. Remilia Corporation will also retain up to 35% of the token supply with a six-month vesting period. That additional supply may mean CULT starts out as a community-owned project. Yet despite promises of avoiding the fate of VC-backed assets, CULT may in fact have a similar tokenomics structure. Even with its current distribution, CULT contains hidden connected wallets, controlling up to 3% of the supply. Bubblemaps discovered hidden wallet clusters among CULT token holders. | Source: Bubblemaps For now, the distribution is relatively fair, with most top wallets receiving 0.03% of the supply during the initial airdrop. CULT price drops after the initial hype The messaging around CULT has been extremely positive, if irrational. Milady PFP influencers have hyped up the token. However, CULT went on a slide in the first hours of trading. CULT established its price levels at $0.0057, with $18.9M in locked liquidity on Uniswap V3. The token has to wait for additional listings after establishing its initial liquidity. The launch of CULT did not have a significant effect on the value of Milady Maker NFTs . The floor price of the collection in fact fell by about 25% in the week before. The CULT launch also coincided with the announcement of the PENGU token, linked to the Pudgy Penguins brand. However, in that case, the PENGU launch helped Penguins become the second-largest NFT collection in terms of market capitalization. CULT does not rely on specific marketing or exchange outreach; it simply uses the long-running Milady social media presence. The investor profile in CULT may be different from other meme trends, potentially affecting the decision to list the asset on big centralized exchanges. Other token launches have arrived with immediate listings, but CULT may spend more time as a volatile token traded on DEXs. In the first hours after the airdrop, the Milady community spread the message of holding without immediate selling. There are also signs of smart whales attempting to snipe some of the supply, while the price is still relatively inactive. Even after the initial price drop, there are few signs of whales selling, while buy orders are moving CULT out of its most active Uniswap trading pair.

Bitwise Shares Optimistic Outlook for BTC, ETH, SOL","Crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuer Bitwise predicted that 2025 will usher in the Golden Age of Crypto. In its latest report, Bitwise outlined a stellar 2025 for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, building on their impressive 2024 performances. Among other things, AI-driven meme coins are also expected to gain traction in the coming year. Bitcoin to $200K and Beyond Bitcoin led the charge in 2024, soaring 141.72% as ETF inflows reached record highs, and its April halving further tightened supply. Bitwise anticipates this momentum to continue, first projecting Bitcoin to reach $200,000, before subsequently hitting $500,000 or more if the US government plans for a 1 million BTC strategic reserve materialize. Ethereum, despite a 75.77% gain, faced competition from faster programmable blockchains in 2024. However, the narrative is expected to shift as Layer 2 solutions like Base and Starknet drive adoption, and spot Ethereum ETFs attract billions in inflows. Solana, “crypto’s phoenix,” climbed 127.71% in 2024, bolstered by meme coin mania. In 2025, Solana’s ecosystem is expected to mature, attracting serious projects like Render, which could cement its position as a leading blockchain. With these catalysts in play, Bitwise believes the “Magnificent Three” will dominate the crypto market, outpacing traditional asset classes once again. Meme coin trends in 2025 could surpass those of 2024, driven by integrating AI agents into the crypto ecosystem. Bitwise highlighted a significant trend: AI agents driving the next wave of meme coins. A notable example is a16z’s Marc Andreessen engaging with the autonomous chatbot Truth Terminal, which promoted the obscure meme coin GOAT. This quirky experiment led to GOAT reaching a $1.3 billion market cap, showcasing the explosive potential of combining AI and meme coins. Another innovation is Clanker, an AI agent operating on Coinbase’s Layer 2 solution, Base. Clanker autonomously deploys tokens when tagged in a Farcaster post, launching over 11,000 tokens in just a month and generating $10.3 million in fees. While most of these tokens may lack utility and likely collapse, the convergence of AI and crypto represents what Bitwise describes as “an interesting collision of two breakthrough technologies – AI and crypto – that bears watching.” IPO Fever to Stablecoins Crushing $400B 2025 will mark a turning point for crypto IPOs as unicorns like Circle, Chainalysis, and Kraken prepare to go public, fueled by rising institutional adoption, mainstream blockchain interest, and an improved regulatory environment. Bitwise also predicted that Coinbase might enter the S&P 500 and MicroStrategy might soon be included in the Nasdaq-100. This could trigger billions in institutional buying from index-tracking funds. Meanwhile, catalysts such as pro-crypto legislation, fintech integration, global remittance adoption, and a thriving crypto economy could drive stablecoins to a $400 billion market cap in 2025. Bitwise ultimately predicts Bitcoin will surpass gold’s $18 trillion market cap and trade above $1 million per coin by 2029, marking the peak of its next four-year cycle.

The political climate in the U.S. is becoming more Bitcoin-friendly, with key appointments and proposed legislation supporting its integration into financial systems. Institutional investors are increasingly treating Bitcoin as a legitimate asset, with forecasts predicting significant demand and price growth. While Bitcoin's volatility remains high, its growing credibility and strategic importance make it a compelling, albeit risky, investment opportunity. Just a few short years (months?) ago, few would have believed it's possible. But it happened: Bitcoin has traded above $100,000 for the first time ever. Global adoption of the world’s largest digital asset by market cap is getting harder to ignore. We’re no longer talking about magic internet money favored by tech enthusiasts. We’re talking about a serious financial asset that central banks, corporations and even national governments are now paying close attention to. Consider the most recent developments: President Nayib Bukele’s El Salvador, the first nation to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021, has reported more than $333 million in Bitcoin profits. And here in the U.S., everyone’s talking about the incoming Trump administration’s plans to establish its own strategic Bitcoin reserve. More Than Digital Gold Part of Bitcoin’s allure is that it shares many characteristics with gold. Last week, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said he believes Bitcoin is a competitor to gold rather than the U.S. dollar. “It’s just like gold, only it’s virtual, it’s digital,” Powell told the audience at the New York Times’ s DealBook Summit. I believe this comparison says a lot. Gold has been a trusted store of value for thousands of years, prized for its scarcity and global liquidity. Central banks just reported buying 60 metric tons of the precious metal in October, the most in a single month this year. U.S. Global Investors Bitcoin shares these attributes in a modern, digital form. Unlike fiat currencies, there’s a fixed supply of Bitcoin, capped at 21 million coins. That scarcity, combined with growing trust and acceptance, has helped it ascend to this six-figure milestone. For the record, I don’t believe gold is going anywhere. It’s been around for over 5,000 years and is deeply ingrained in global commerce and traditions. Gold trades over $160 billion every day, making it the second-most liquid asset category after the S&P 500, according to the World Gold Council (WGC). Plus, unlike Bitcoin, gold has many practical use cases, from jewelry to electronics. But Bitcoin is carving out its own path, proving it can also serve as a store of value in turbulent times. The chart below shows the Bitcoin-to-gold ratio, which tells you how many ounces of gold it takes to buy one Bitcoin. Last week, the ratio surpassed 38, a new all-time high. U.S. Global Investors Political Winds Shifting in Bitcoin’s Favor It’s not just Wall Street that’s warming up to Bitcoin. The political climate appears to be shifting as well. President-elect Donald Trump—a former crypto skeptic turned fan—recently nominated Paul Atkins, a conservative and crypto-friendly lawyer, to replace Gary Gensler as the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). During his tenure at the SEC from 2002 to 2008, Atkins fought for balanced, innovation-friendly policies. His return could pave the way for more regulatory clarity, attracting even more institutional capital into the crypto space. Trump also just named billionaire venture capitalist David Sacks as his “AI and crypto czar.” Sacks, a member of the so-called PayPal Mafia, is another strong advocate for clear regulations in cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence. His leadership, I believe, could help position the U.S. as a global leader in emerging technologies, including Bitcoin, blockchain and AI. And on Capitol Hill, Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, a longtime Bitcoin advocate, has proposed the BITCOIN Act, which, if passed, would lead to the creation of a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve. Just as the Strategic Petroleum Reserve ((SPR)) ensures a steady supply of oil in times of emergency, a Bitcoin reserve could serve as a digital financial backstop, a buffer against economic shocks and runaway inflation. Analysts’ Forecasts Turn (Even More) Bullish Major financial institutions and research firms aren’t sitting idle. Bernstein Private Wealth Management projects Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by late 2025, a forecast echoed by Standard Chartered. While I tend to avoid making price predictions, especially short-term ones, I believe $200,000 by the end of next year—an approximately 100% increase from today's price—is a conservative estimate. Since 2010, Bitcoin has more than doubled seven times on an annual basis. So far this year, it's gained nearly 130%. Here's something to consider: Even if Bitcoin rose ""only"" 50% between now and the end of 2025, that would put the digital asset's price at approximately $144,000. One of the key drivers of these higher forecasts is the inflow of institutional money. Big investors— corporations, pension funds, endowments —are starting to treat Bitcoin as a legitimate part of a diversified portfolio. According to analysts, if U.S. retirement funds or a proposed U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve started accumulating even a small percentage of their assets in Bitcoin, demand could skyrocket. MicroStrategy, a publicly traded company, has shown leadership in this area. Its aggressive three-year Bitcoin purchasing plan has already exceeded expectations. Its strategy? Treat Bitcoin like a corporate treasury reserve asset. U.S. Global Investors Allocate Responsibly So, what does all this mean for investors? First, it means that Bitcoin is no longer a fringe phenomenon. At over $100,000 per coin, it’s a force to be reckoned with, attracting serious interest from global institutions and governments. That said, investing in Bitcoin should still be approached thoughtfully. Volatility remains high. While gold typically moves at a measured pace, Bitcoin’s price can swing more dramatically. Proper allocation could provide exposure to Bitcoin’s growth potential without taking on excessive risk. As regulators become more crypto-friendly, and as the U.S. government considers strategic reserves, Bitcoin’s credibility and staying power have only grown. This isn’t to say Bitcoin will replace gold overnight or that it comes without risks. But after crossing the psychologically important $100,000 mark, it’s clear that the world’s largest cryptocurrency is maturing into a bona fide financial instrument worthy of consideration.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4743495-rise-of-bitcoin-as-serious-financial-asset-in-2024?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/37496965.jpeg

Bitcoin Price Nears at $97,500: Symmetrical Triangle Signals Breakout Potential Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is trading at $97,381, reflecting a modest 0.17% gain over the last 24 hours. The cryptocurrency remains confined within a symmetrical triangle pattern, suggesting a phase of consolidation as traders await a decisive breakout. With the pivot point positioned at $97,739, Bitcoin is testing immediate resistance near $98,106. A successful breach above this level could pave the way for targets at $100,418 and $102,106. On the downside, immediate support is visible at $95,744, with additional layers at $94,405 and $92,121. The 50 EMA at $96,875 is providing strong technical backing, reinforcing bullish sentiment as long as prices remain above the pivot. The RSI at 51 suggests neutral momentum, indicating that traders are cautiously waiting for directional confirmation. The symmetrical triangle pattern underscores Bitcoin’s current indecisiveness, yet such setups often precede sharp moves. A breakout above $98,106 could signal further upside, while a drop below $95,744 may shift sentiment bearish. Key Insights: Consolidation Phase: Bitcoin is trading within a symmetrical triangle, signaling indecision and potential for sharp movement. Resistance Levels: Critical levels at $98,106, $100,418, and $102,106 could determine further bullish trends. Support Zones: Key support at $95,744 and $94,405 provides a safety net against downside risks. – You might also like Bitcoin Price Prediction 2024 – 2034 The post Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Hovers at $97,500 Amid Triangle Breakout Potential appeared first on Cryptonews .",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-hovers-at-97500-amid-triangle-breakout-potential/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/37497204.jpeg

However, in the current market cycle, Ethereum has lagged behind Bitcoin, suggesting a shift in market dynamics. Ethereum’s taker volume is at a record low, which is a bearish signal.

Analysts see potential for the asset to hit $8.40 to $48.12, citing strong technical patterns. XRP Outperforms Its Rivals The cryptocurrency market continues to struggle following the latest correction, with many leading digital assets charting minor losses on a daily scale. However, this is not the case for Ripple’s XRP, whose price has risen by 6% in the past 24 hours. Several hours ago, it crossed $2.40, while currently, it trades at around $2.32 (per CoinGecko’s data). Its market capitalization is approximately $132 billion, positioning the asset as the fourth-largest in the sector. XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko Perhaps the most important factor fueling the rally is the development surrounding Ripple’s upcoming stablecoin – RLUSD. Just recently, CEO Brad Garlinghouse revealed that the financial product has received “final approval” from the NYDFS. “Exchange and partner listings will be live soon – and reminder: when RLUSD is live, you’ll hear it from Ripple first,” the exec added. The company displayed its intentions to introduce a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar in April this year. Months later, it launched a testing phase during which it minted and burned millions of tokens. Last month, X user Vet claimed that almost all stablecoins have been burned. “On each Ethereum and XRP Ledger, there is only around 100k RLUSD left,” they added . XRP’s Next Potential Targets The regulatory approval for RLUSD has triggered huge enthusiasm across the Ripple community. Some X users, including XRPcryptowolf, have made bullish predictions, envisioning that the stablecoin “will make XRP the number 1 crypto.” Other analysts who recently set price targets for the token include Ali Martinez and veteran trader Peter Brandt. The former suggested that XRP “looks undervalued after breaking out of this massive multi-year symmetrical triangle.” He set a “conservative target” of $8.40 and an “optimistic” one of a staggering $48.12. Brandt claimed that XRP has “the most powerful chart in all of the crypto world.” It is worth mentioning that the market observers weighed in at the end of last week when the coin’s valuation was well above $2.50. At the start of this week, though, XRP experienced a severe pullback, briefly dropping below $2 and later recovering some of the losses.

The milestone of $100K for Bitcoin was the selling point for most of the traders, which offered strong momentum to the other altcoins like XRP, ADA, TRX, etc. and many more. Moreover, the long-time holders started to fix some profit, expecting to witness some results. Hence, this compelled the BTC price to plunge heavily and pushed the entire market into a correction state. Meanwhile, it may not be judged as the end of the bull run, as the correction is not expected to last long. The markets are experiencing a significant downturn as the traders are taking profits and new hands are entering the markets. Hence, it appears that the markets may need more time to settle, which could prevail for another couple of weeks. In the meantime, the BTC price rally is expected to remain stuck between $96,000 and $100,000. So what’s next? When can we expect a breakout? The weekly chart of Bitcoin suggests the token is within a bullish range and following a strong incremental pattern. However, the price appears to have reached the highs of the prevailing run and as a result, a pullback could be fast approaching. The weekly MACD shows a drop in the buying pressure after it remained dominant since the second fortnight of October. Besides, the RSI is about to break down from the overbought range after facing a bearish divergence. These indicators substantiate the bearish claim, forecasting a bearish close for the year below $95,000, ending the possibility of a ‘Christmas Rally’. Besides, the ETF storm may prevent excess bearish action as the inflows recorded are higher than the previous month. Moreover, with Trump and Republicans behind the wheel, the bull run is expected to intensify once the new president resumes office. Therefore, the market always experiences corrections and this one is not the first. Therefore, even if the Bitcoin (BTC) price marks new lows for the month, it could be another opportunity to accumulate as it is primed to mark the peak above $110K, somewhere in 2025.",NEUTRAL,ADA | BTC,ADA | ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/why-bitcoin-is-stuck-within-96k-to-100k-range-will-the-christmas-rally-kick-off-or-a-bearish-yearly-close-be-imminent/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

The upgraded stocks include MARA Holdings (MARA), CleanSpark (CLSK), Riot Platforms (RIOT), and IREN (IREN). All four are trading near or above their revised price targets. “We previously valued Bitcoin miners based on the four-year gross profit opportunity for each operator,” analysts Reginald Smith and Charles Pearce stated in the report. “We are expanding upon this framework by incorporating 1) the value of each company’s land and power assets and 2) a HODL premium, which gives miners credit for holding Bitcoin on their balance like MicroStrategy.” HODL Premiums The report highlighted that MicroStrategy (MSTR), which has transformed into a de facto Bitcoin fund, trades at approximately 2.4x the value of its BTC treasury. As of Dec. 10, MicroStrategy’s year-to-date gains stood at nearly 450%, far exceeding Bitcoin’s 125% growth, according to Google Finance. MicroStrategy holds the largest corporate BTC treasury, valued at roughly $40 billion.

While this may seem alarming, experts like Michaël van de Poppe explain that such corrections are typical in crypto’s volatile cycles and shouldn’t cause panic. In a recent X post, Michaël van de Poppe discussed the ongoing 30% drop in the altcoin market, highlighting the panic it has caused among investors. He noted that some altcoins, like Bittensor, experienced a dramatic 50% drop in just 24 hours, triggering a shift in market sentiment. However, van de Poppe emphasized that such corrections are common in the crypto space, where sentiment swings are often exaggerated. What’s dropping the bullish momentum? Looking at the current downturn, he explained that this correction might seem alarming, but investors must stick to their plans and maintain a balanced portfolio. Rebalancing and focusing on base assets can help investors profit and capitalize on future opportunities when the market rebounds. Van de Poppe also pointed out that the correction is partly due to a liquidity crunch, with overleveraged markets experiencing a major crash, the biggest in three years. This was likely caused by excessive confidence and increasing leverage in the market. Hold, Buy or Sell? Analysts Weigh In Raoul Pal sees Bitcoin heading for a major bull run but cautions against blindly expecting a repeat of past patterns. Pal suggests that many investors might sell too early, driven by fears from previous cycles, only to miss out if the market peaks later, likely around late October 2025 if liquidity remains favorable. It will also be a good opportunity for altcoins. However, Van de Poppe encouraged investors to hold their positions if they believed in the long-term potential of their altcoins. He emphasized that while corrections are tough, they shouldn’t derail one’s investment approach. With the uptrend still in its early stages for most markets, he recommended staying patient and avoiding rash decisions that could lead to significant losses. At present the altcoins are in good shape as Bitcoin’s dominance declines and their market cap hits new highs, currently at $1.89 trillion.

December 2024 might just be the month where everything starts to fall into place. Near Protocol is making waves with its latest sharding tech upgrade, and XRP is grabbing attention despite legal drama. But let’s be real—what if there’s a crypto that’s not just riding the current trends but actually setting new rules? That’s where Qubetics ($TICS) comes into the picture. This isn’t just another token—it’s an entire ecosystem built to tokenize real-world assets like property and commodities. And here’s the kicker: its presale is already raising millions, with analysts making bold predictions about insane returns. Whether you’re looking for short-term wins or eyeing a bigger picture, it’s time to dig into what makes these three cryptos worth a closer look. Qubetics’ Innovative Approach to Real-World Asset Tokenization Qubetics ($TICS) is making strides with its Real-World Asset Tokenization application, enabling tangible assets like real estate and commodities to be represented digitally on the blockchain. This innovation offers increased liquidity and accessibility for investors. For instance, a real estate developer can tokenize property assets, allowing investors to purchase fractions of the property, thereby lowering entry barriers and diversifying investment portfolios. Similarly, small businesses can tokenize inventory or future revenue streams to secure funding without traditional loans. The Qubetics presale is in its 12th stage, with over 303 million $TICS tokens sold to more than 8,300 holders, raising over $5.4 million. Tokens are available at $0.031 each, with a 10% price increase anticipated in the 13th stage starting this weekend. Each presale stage lasts seven days, concluding every Sunday at midnight, followed by the price adjustment. Analysts predict significant returns for $TICS , with potential gains of over 32,000% if the token reaches $10 after the mainnet launch. For example, an $80,000 investment at the current presale price could yield substantial returns if these forecasts materialize. To learn more about this project, take a look at this video . Near Protocol’s Recent Developments and Market Performance Near Protocol has recently experienced a 17% increase in value, trading at $6.83. This growth is attributed to its innovative approach to scalability and user-friendly applications. The platform’s focus on enhancing transaction speeds and reducing costs has attracted developers and investors alike. In November 2024, Near Protocol announced the launch of Phase 2 of its sharding technology, aiming to improve scalability and decentralization. This development is expected to increase the network’s capacity and efficiency, positioning it as a strong contender in the blockchain space. Despite these advancements, Near Protocol faces challenges, including increased competition and the need for continuous innovation. However, its commitment to technological progress and a growing community support its potential for sustained growth. XRP’s Market Dynamics and Regulatory Landscape XRP has recently faced a 7.6% decline, trading at $2.38. This downturn is partly due to ongoing legal challenges with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However, the appointment of crypto-friendly figures in the new administration has sparked optimism for a favorable resolution. In December 2024, XRP’s market cap reached $250 billion, reflecting its significant presence in the crypto market. The potential for regulatory clarity could further enhance its adoption and value. Despite legal hurdles, XRP continues to facilitate cross-border transactions efficiently, maintaining partnerships with financial institutions worldwide. Its resilience and utility underscore its position as a notable cryptocurrency. Conclusion: Evaluating the Best Cryptos to Join in December 2024 Choosing the best cryptos to join in December 2024 is no small task, but it’s a decision worth getting right. Near Protocol’s cutting-edge sharding tech makes it a strong contender for scalability geeks, while XRP continues to show why it’s a household name in cross-border payments—even with its regulatory battles. But Qubetics ($TICS) ? That’s the underdog rewriting the rules with asset tokenization and a presale that’s caught the eye of seasoned investors.

37496569,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51874,1733905812,Things 60 Minutes Sentimentally Got Wrong About XRP and Cryptocurrencies,"A recent segment on CBS’s 60 Minutes has sparked significant discussion within the cryptocurrency community, particularly surrounding its portrayal of XRP . The episode addressed the broader crypto market, focusing on XRP’s recent gains and the controversies often associated with digital currencies, such as their potential misuse in illicit activities. This coverage has been met with mixed reactions from crypto enthusiasts, with notable figures like Digital Asset Investor commenting on its impact. A Spotlight on XRP’s Performance The 60 Minutes feature prominently showcased XRP, which has experienced remarkable price growth recently, climbing as high as $2.82, its highest level in nearly seven years. This surge follows Ripple’s legal successes in its ongoing battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has bolstered investor confidence. Despite a slight pullback, XRP remains a focal point in discussions about the potential for cryptocurrency to reshape financial markets. For many in the crypto space, the mention of XRP’s gains on such a prominent platform underscores its significance as a digital asset with real-world use cases. Ripple’s advancements in cross-border payments and its push for regulatory clarity have placed it at the center of debates about the future of financial innovation. Criticism of the Narrative While XRP’s recent price action received positive attention, the segment also delved into criticisms of cryptocurrency, particularly claims that digital assets facilitate criminal activities like human trafficking. These assertions have drawn pushback from crypto advocates who argue that such concerns often lack nuance. For example, X user, Adam Elliott Davis highlighted that crimes enabled by fiat currency, which is largely untraceable, continue unabated. He suggested addressing these crimes requires better law enforcement rather than stifling technological innovation. Such arguments reflect a broader frustration within the industry about the media’s tendency to focus on crypto’s potential downsides without equal emphasis on its benefits. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Broader Implications The 60 Minutes coverage comes at a pivotal time for Ripple and the crypto market. With regulatory uncertainties still looming, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has voiced concerns about how XRP and the company’s efforts are portrayed. He noted that the segment omitted crucial details about Ripple’s legal victories, which could have provided viewers with a more balanced perspective on the crypto sector’s challenges and achievements. Nonetheless, the exposure of XRP to a mainstream audience is regarded as a net positive by many community members. Digital Asset Investor’s tweet encapsulates this sentiment, emphasizing that Americans are drawn to the tangible gains of assets like XRP rather than regulatory skepticism. Advocates argue that free markets should determine the viability of digital currencies, not preemptive judgments from regulators or media outlets.

37497201,https://cryptonews.com/?p=318604,1733905801,"Scammers Exploit Telegram Bots to Inject Malware and Steal Crypto, Warns Scam Sniffer","Blockchain security firm Scam Sniffer has raised alarms about a new wave of scams targeting cryptocurrency users through fake Telegram verification bots. These schemes use social engineering tactics to inject malware into victims’ systems, ultimately compromising crypto wallets. In a December 10 post on X , Scam Sniffer detailed how scammers are impersonating popular crypto influencers by creating fake X accounts. Scammers Lure Users into Telegram Groups The scammers lure unsuspecting users into Telegram groups, enticing them with promises of exclusive investment insights. Once inside the group, users are instructed to verify their accounts through a bot called “OfficiaISafeguardBot.” This fake verification bot creates a sense of urgency with short verification windows, compelling users to act quickly. According to Scam Sniffer, the bot injects malicious PowerShell code into victims’ devices, allowing it to download and execute malware. This malware compromises the systems, granting scammers access to private keys and enabling them to raid cryptocurrency wallets. Scam Sniffer reported numerous cases of malware theft linked directly to this fake bot. 3/7 Once in the Telegram group, users are immediately prompted to verify through OfficiaISafeguardBot. This fake bot creates artificial urgency with extremely short verification windows. pic.twitter.com/wGC1m8Fai1 — Scam Sniffer | Web3 Anti-Scam (@realScamSniffer) December 10, 2024 The firm noted that all recently identified cases involved the same fraudulent verification process. While other malicious bots may exist, the security firm emphasized how easily scammers can impersonate additional services. The infrastructure behind such scams is evolving rapidly, Scam Sniffer said, likening the approach to a “scam-as-a-service” model. This concept mirrors how creators of crypto wallet-draining tools lease their software to phishing scammers. The firm highlighted that while malware targeting regular users is not new, this specific combination of fake X accounts, Telegram channels, and malicious bots marks a concerning development. The prevalence of scams on X has also surged. Scam Sniffer’s monitoring system recorded an average of 300 impersonation accounts per day in December, nearly doubling November’s average of 160. These fake accounts promote malicious links and fraudulent tokens, often resulting in significant losses. At least two victims have reportedly lost over $3 million after interacting with these scams. Other security firms have echoed Scam Sniffer’s warnings. Web3 Workers Targeted with Fake Meeting Apps Cado Security Labs recently flagged a campaign targeting Web3 workers with fake meeting apps designed to steal login credentials and crypto wallet access. Similarly, Web3 security platform Cyvers predicted a rise in phishing attacks in December, as cybercriminals exploit the increased online activity during the holiday season. Just recently, Radiant Capital revealed that it has fallen victim to a hack that drained $50 million from its decentralized finance (DeFi) platform. As reported, cybersecurity firm Mandiant concluded with “high confidence” that the attack could be attributed to a threat actor linked to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). This is not the first major attack on Radiant this year. In January, the platform suffered a $4.5 million flash loan exploit, which also forced the suspension of its lending markets. Likewise, South Korea has accused North Korea of orchestrating the 2019 hack on cryptocurrency exchange Upbit, which resulted in the theft of 342,000 ETH, then valued at $41.5 million.

The upgrade not only improves core trading functionalities but also introduces three important functions of innovation and optimization, which comprehensively improve users' trading flexibility and asset security. Details of the features are as follows: Unrealized Profits for New Positions This feature allows traders to use unrealized profits as a margin to open new positions without waiting for the current position to close. By reinvesting potential gains immediately, users can enhance fund efficiency and respond more dynamically in volatile markets. Hedging for Long-Short Positioning Compared with the previous Two-Way Positioning Feature, the new hedging function allows users not only to hold both long and short orders in the same trading pair but also to easily realize risk hedging and income lock. Whether in the face of severe market volatility or when the trend is still uncertain, users can hedge operations to avoid potential risks, due to market fluctuations brought about by the retraction of earnings. Cross Margin Mode: Shared Funds for Reduced Liquidation Risks In Cross Margin mode, all the funds in the user's account are aggregated to provide mutual support for multiple positions. That is, the user does not have to manually input the margin every time for each trade, because the system will automatically distribute funds across all open positions. This mechanism reduces the risk of a single position blowing up and enhances the overall stability of the account. “Listening to users, improving every step.” ""Our focus has always been on meeting user needs and ensuring trading security.” Michael BYDFi's CO-Founder said, “The BYDFi product team stated that by actively interacting with users, they will continuously adjust and improve the platform's features to meet the diverse needs of the market”. How to Access These New Features Now an upgraded version of the perpetual contract system is live. Users can log in to BYDFi and enter into the perpetual trading interface to try the new features.

The company announced it acquired over 11,000 Bitcoin recently, demonstrating its growing commitment to increasing its digital asset holdings. This purchase is part of a broader strategy that many major firms are adopting, including MicroStrategy and Riot Platforms. The acquisition was funded through proceeds from a zero-coupon convertible notes offering. Marathon stated this financing method exceeded expectations, allowing them to strengthen their position in the Bitcoin market. With this latest buy, Marathon's total Bitcoin holdings have reached over 40,000, valued in the billions based on current market prices. The company emphasized that it is actively blending mining operations with direct Bitcoin purchases to maximize its market presence. This aggressive accumulation comes amid a surge in corporate interest in Bitcoin. Recently, other industry players like Riot Platforms and MicroStrategy have also made substantial Bitcoin investments , indicating a trend of institutional adoption in the cryptocurrency space. Despite facing financial challenges earlier in the year, Marathon has doubled down on its strategy, particularly during the fourth quarter, after experiencing notable setbacks in Q3. While the company’s stock has seen some fluctuations recently, these moves reflect a long-term vision centered on leveraging Bitcoin's potential as a valuable asset. Marathon Digital now holds one of the largest corporate Bitcoin reserves and shows no signs of slowing down its acquisition pace. By combining mining profits with strategic purchases, Marathon aims to solidify its reputation as a leader in the Bitcoin ecosystem. The company also disclosed its position in official filings with the SEC, further highlighting its commitment to transparency. These filings confirm the firm's growing Bitcoin reserves and underscore its aggressive expansion in the cryptocurrency market. This aligns with a broader trend among major corporations building up significant Bitcoin stockpiles as part of their investment strategies. Marathon’s latest moves demonstrate not only its confidence in Bitcoin’s future but also its intention to stay ahead of the curve in a rapidly evolving industry.

37496317,https://invezz.com/?p=2382197,1733904868,Tether’s USDT gains approval for regulated services in Abu Dhabi,"Tether’s USDT is now an accepted virtual currency within the Abu Dhabi Global Market, as the move marks the United Arab Emirate’s latest push to bolster the gap between traditional and decentralised finance. Announced on December 10, the development opens up doors for USDT-based services to be developed for entities authorised by the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) of the Abu Dhabi Global Markets (ADGM). Founded in 2015, the ADGM is an international financial hub located on Al Maryah Island governed by its own legal and regulatory framework. It offers a business-friendly environment with perks like tax incentives to stimulate innovation alongside economic growth. As of March 2024, the ADGM was home to approximately 1,825 active firms spanning diverse sectors, including prominent names such as Brevan Howard, Ardian, Goldman Sachs, BlackRock , SBI Capital, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, Apollo, and Vibrant Capital. Now, these firms will be able to utilise and offer pre-approved services related to USDT across the Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche blockchain networks. With a market capitalisation of over $138 billion and accounting for the largest market share , USDT is expected to drive economic progress and digital transformation in the region. According to Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino, the approval as an accepted virtual asset will enable “new doors for collaboration and growth across the Middle East.” He applauded the United Arab Emirates’s (UAE) “forward-thinking approach” and benchmark regulations, which have positioned the nation as one of the biggest and fastest-growing cryptocurrency hubs in the world. UAE fosters stablecoin adoption The UAE has encouraged stablecoin adoption by allowing licensed issuers to deploy dirham-pegged stablecoins. Tether itself is developing one such stablecoin via a joint venture with Phoenix Group PLC, a UAE-based tech giant, and Green Acorn Investments Ltd. The stablecoin would act as a hedge against currency devaluation and allow cheap cross-border remittance. The AE coin , a stablecoin developed by the Central Bank of the UAE, was granted in-principal on December 10 as a part of the nation’s effort to regulate the stablecoin sector. Earlier this year, stablecoin issuer Paxos launched a yield-generating stablecoin called the Lift Dollar (USDL) via its global arm Paxos International, which is also regulated by the FSRA. However, on an international level, stablecoin adoption is facing a lot of hiccups as certain regulators are concerned about the various risks to the economy such assets pose following incidents like the implosion of Terra USD, which saw billions of dollars worth of value wiped out from the market in a very short time frame. Tether faces backlash Recently, the United States Financial Services Oversight Council (FSOC) raised concerns about the monopoly within the global stablecoin market, the lack of transparency, and poor risk management standards across issuers. While the FSOC did not name any specific firm, it said that the market was dominated by a single firm accounting for “around 70 per cent of the sector’s total market value,” hinting at Tether. To mitigate risks, the council called for prompt regulations, warning that several issuers were operating “outside of, or in noncompliance with, a comprehensive federal prudential framework.” The post Tether’s USDT gains approval for regulated services in Abu Dhabi appeared first on Invezz",POSITIVE,USDT,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | USDT,,0,0,Invezz,https://invezz.com/news/2024/12/11/tethers-usdt-gains-approval-for-regulated-services-in-abu-dhabi/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png

It’s no joke—meme coins are now serious business in the crypto space. From iconic names like Dogecoin to the latest stars on the rise, the best meme coins to invest in for long term are reshaping the market. Meet BTFD Coin (BTFD) , a rallying cry for crypto enthusiasts to “Buy the F***ing Dip.” This powerhouse isn’t just about clever branding; it’s backed by a live Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, lucrative staking rewards, and a die-hard community. Its presale has already raised a whopping $2.8 million, with over 4,200 bulls on board and counting. But the excitement doesn’t stop there. Contenders like SPX6900 (SPX) and Apu Apustaja (APU) are also making waves. SPX6900 is emerging as a potential rival to XRP, while APU charms the meme coin crowd with its Kraken debut and strong community vibe. So, why does BTFD deserve the crown? Let’s dig in. BTFD Coin: The Meme Kingpin Redefining Opportunities BTFD Coin isn’t your average meme token—it’s a movement built for those who see market dips as golden opportunities. Its presale launched at $0.000004 per coin, skyrocketing to $0.0001 in Stage 10 with over $2.8 million raised in just two weeks. Over 45 billion coins have been snapped up by a community of over 4,200 investors. And here’s the kicker: BTFD will list at $0.0006, giving presale participants a chance for massive gains. If you’re thinking of investing $2,500 now at $0.0001 per coin, you’d bag 25 million BTFD tokens. By the time the price hits $0.0006, your initial investment could grow to $15,000. Not bad, right? Beyond the numbers, BTFD is rich in features. Its P2E game lets users earn tokens while having fun and staking rewards with a 90% APY offer a juicy incentive to hold on for the long haul. Plus, it’s built on Ethereum, ensuring security and scalability. With phrases like “ Buy The F***ing Dip ” rallying its community, BTFD is poised to dominate the meme coin space. SPX6900: The Meme Coin Contender SPX6900 (SPX) has been grabbing attention for its wild market swings and potential to rival major players like XRP. Trading at around $0.7327, SPX has a market cap of $682.11 million and a circulating supply nearing its maximum of 1 billion tokens. What sets SPX apart? It reached an all-time high of $0.9855 in late October and still holds strong despite a slight decline. Some analysts believe it could hit the coveted $1 billion market cap, making it a solid candidate for anyone seeking the best meme coins to invest in for long term. While SPX’s liquidity has raised some eyebrows, its dedicated community and innovative features keep it afloat. If you’re into high-risk, high-reward investments, SPX might just fit the bill. Apu Apustaja: The Underdog Winning Hearts Apu Apustaja (APU) is a meme coin for those who love a good underdog story. Trading at about $0.0008646, APU boasts a market cap of $331.93 million and a devoted fanbase. Its recent listing on Kraken has brought newfound attention, making it one of the most accessible meme coins for new investors. With its origins in meme culture, APU resonates deeply with Gen Z and Millennials. The coin reached an all-time high of $0.001466 in November and has shown resilience despite the usual market dips. While it’s not as flashy as BTFD or SPX, APU’s charm lies in its community-driven approach and steady growth potential. Conclusion If you’re scouring the market for the best meme coins to invest in for long term, BTFD Coin is the clear winner. Its impressive meme coin presale performance, inovative features, and active community make it a no-brainer for savvy investors. The chance to buy at $0.0001 and potentially see a 6x return by the presale’s end is an opportunity you don’t want to miss. That said, SPX6900 and Apu Apustaja offer unique advantages, from SPX’s high market cap ambitions to APU’s grassroots appeal. Each coin has its place, but BTFD’s blend of utility, rewards, and community power sets it apart. Don’t wait for the next dip—join the BTFD Coin presale now and ride the wave to the next bull market.

In a new Kitco News interview, Jack Mallers says he expects the incoming Trump administration to boost the economy by making it clear that the government is pro-growth, pro-business and pro-innovation. He also says the US can deal with its fiscal issues by building a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Mallers highlights that the move would be a huge positive for retail investors, corporations and institutions that already own BTC without negatively impacting those without skin in the game. “We realize we have a deficit problem and a debt problem. We want to back our future promises with the future, with the fastest-growing asset. We want to give confidence to the people that we acknowledge the problem, and we’re building toward it. This acts in the best interest of the public. It’s not we’re taking your stuff, it’s not we’re debasing your stuff, it’s not we’re taking the side of the banks. The large supply of this asset is owned by the general public. This is a move that acts in the best interest of the people, this is a move that acts in the best interest of business. This is pro-business, this is pro-labor, this is pro-energy, this is pro-industry.” In July, Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming said she would announce a bill to establish a BTC reserve as a means of securing the value of the US dollar amid a record-breaking national debt. The legislation would drive the US government to accumulate one million BTC or 5% of BTC’s total supply in five years. At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $96,801, down over 1% on the day.

As a result, these tokens lag behind their respective ATHs while the others form a new one. Now that the Bitcoin price rally has kicked off above the psychological barrier at $100K, these top memecoins have begun to swell. In due course, the SHIB price has encountered massive selloffs after reaching a pivotal resistance, which could be a matter of concern. The current price action suggests the SHIB price has surged above critical resistance at around $0.000027; a valid breakout could trigger short-term upward momentum. Meanwhile, the bulls are offering enough support by backing the rally with enough buying pressure. However, the seller’s dominance continues to remain higher, which could probably push the token under bearish clouds. Given that the Shiba INU price remains within a decisive phase, will the bulls manage to kick off a strong upswing to the resistance above $0.000035? Currently, two major bearish crossovers are about to occur, which may intensify the ongoing bearish trend. Firstly, the base & conversion lines of the Ichimoku cloud are heading for a bearish crossover and secondly, the +Di & -Di of the DMI levels. The ADX & RSI are both decremental, while the MACD indicates the selling pressure is slowly mounting up. Adding more substance to the bearish momentum, the OBV—the volume-based indicators also plunge, suggesting a massive drop in the volume. However, the higher targets for the SHIB price rally remain above $0.000045; however, the token is required to sustain above $0.000035 to validate a bullish move. Meanwhile, a sharp drop in the Shiba Inu price following the BTC correction could be a good signal as the investors show interest. This suggests a rise in demand for the token, which may turn the sentiments of the token from bearish to bullish. If the market correction widens, the Shiba Inu price is expected to drop below $0.000025; otherwise, a rebound, which is more likely to happen, may revive a rise above $0.00003, trying to close the yearly trade above $0.000035.",NEGATIVE,BTC | SHIB,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/heres-whats-next-for-shiba-inu-shib-price-rally-as-it-losses-a-crucial-price-range/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Ali’s post has drawn significant attention from the crypto community as it identifies critical levels and projects an optimistic price target for XRP. In his tweet, Ali stated: “$XRP: 3 consecutive bull pennants! We should all be praying for a retest of $2.25 to buy the dip and target $4.40!” The chart attached to the tweet outlines XRP’s upward trajectory, punctuated by consolidative pennant formations. Each pennant has led to a breakout, reinforcing the bullish momentum. Currently, XRP appears to be consolidating within the third pennant, suggesting that another breakout could be imminent if the trend persists. $XRP : 3 consecutive bull pennants! We should all be praying for a retest of $2.25 to buy the dip and target $4.40! pic.twitter.com/KgXnM929yk — Ali (@ali_charts) December 9, 2024 The $2.25 Price Level as XRP Key Support Zone Ali specifically pointed out the $2.25 level as a crucial support area. A retest of this level could present a buying opportunity for traders aiming to capitalize on the potential rally toward $4.40. The $2.25 level aligns with the base of the current pennant and is critical for maintaining the bullish structure. One user on X echoed Ali’s sentiment, commenting: “Testing 2.25 totally makes sense. Obviously, people shorted the 60-minute interview, and good for them if they made money trading—it was a risk. 2.25 is the bottom.” This perspective underscores the widespread belief that $2.25 represents a strong foundation for the next leg upward. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Enthusiasm Beyond $4.40 While Ali’s target of $4.40 has excited many, some XRP investors have expressed aspirations for even higher price levels. Another X user, Jagjeet, remarked : “Tell me more Mohammad Ali, tell me more. What happens after $4.4? $4.4 is great, but I didn’t hodl $XRP for 6 years to sell at $4.4—I did it to sell at double digits.” This sentiment highlights the long-term optimism surrounding XRP. Many investors are eyeing higher targets, fueled by fundamental developments and growing interest in the cryptocurrency sector. Technical Outlook The presence of consecutive bull pennants indicates a strong uptrend, and the projected breakout target of $4.40 aligns with the technical structure. However, a successful retest of the $2.25 support level could be crucial for confirming bullish continuation. Traders and investors should closely monitor XRP’s price action, particularly around these levels, to evaluate the strength of the trend.

This $0.12 Altcoin Could Yield More as XRP Price Dumps,"Cardano (ADA) is showing a promising future in spite of its recent poor performance. Cardano’s (ADA) return to its previous trading range has been emphasized by renowned cryptocurrency analyst Michaël van de Poppe, suggesting the possibility of achieving a unique all-time high price level. However, the topic of whether Cardano (ADA) is still the greatest option for investing or whether the new $0.12 cryptocurrency DTX is the best option now. By tokenizing real-world assets, DTX makes it possible for contemporary traders with a variety of asset holdings to engage in cross-trading between cryptocurrencies and physical assets. By launching the greatest trading features of any platform now in use, DTX Exchange hopes to become a major player in the years to come. XRP Price Analysis: Warning Signs of a Potential Decline As XRP shows its first big negative signal since the recent jump, it indicates that the XRP price growth is coming to an end. A further price correction might result from the present upswing of losing strength, as shown by the lower highs of the XRP price. A decline frequently starts at a lower high. Given that the XRP price has yet to move beyond its most recent top, there is a chance that selling pressure may increase. The fact that trade volume has been declining over the past several sessions adds to this worry. The XRP price has to bounce back to the $2.80 mark in order to reverse the bearish trend and rekindle positive momentum; this will require a significant rise in trading volume. Martial Law Declaration Triggers 52% XRP Price Drop on Upbit The South Korean president’s accusations caused Upbit’s XRP price to fall as well. The XRP price dropped as low as ₩1,623 ($1.13) on the market, a sharp 52% decline in value, although it has subsequently rebounded to ₩3,400 ($2.37) on Upbit. According to Google Finance, the South Korean won’s value in relation to the US dollar also dropped by around 3% after the news. According to CoinGecko, Upbit’s trading volume jumped 32% in the last day to $23 billion when the president of South Korea declared martial law. Cardano (ADA) News: Draft Constitution Heads to Community Vote Cardano (ADA), the ninth-largest cryptocurrency with a $40 billion market valuation, is making waves in the industry after its constitution was recently approved in a worldwide convention that took place from December 4–6 in Argentina and Kenya. According to Cardano’s IOG and EMURGO on X, the first draft of the Cardano Constitution is a thorough set of “provisions and guardrails” intended to direct the development of the blockchain. A major choice is about to be made by the Cardano (ADA) community as the constitution moves closer to a formal vote that is set for January 2025. To determine whether to accept or reject the draft constitution, Cardano’s Delegated Representatives (DReps) will vote on it. Around 800 DReps make up the Cardano (ADA) ecosystem, and more than half of them actively participate in governance by making deposits totaling 500 ADA, or around $600. DTX Exchange Revolutionizes ETFs with Tokenized Trading After generating $10.03 million in presale revenue, DTX Exchange has attracted a lot of attention. DTX is a peer-to-peer network that minimizes centralized security risks and vulnerabilities while providing decentralization and user liberty. The SEC’s regulatory clarity has allowed XRP to take the lead in this bull cycle. As DTX Exchange introduces a new feature positioned to benefit from the debut of ETFs, market focus is shifting to the exchange. It is the most recent illustration of a novel approach to decentralized finance that has the potential to upend the ETF industry. Tokenized exchange-traded funds (ETFs) allow traders to acquire fractional shares of a variety of assets, including stocks, commodities, and cryptocurrencies. Retail traders may now finally access the markets that are only accessible to institutional investors thanks to this reduction in the entrance hurdle.

Some investors worry about the Altcoin’s short-term performance as the crypto market pulls back. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees First Close Above $100,000, But Is A Big Correction Coming? Solana Drops To Lowest Level In A Month Solana has been one of the leading cryptocurrencies this cycle, outperforming most of the market and stealing the headlines. Unlike most altcoins, the cryptocurrency outperformed during the Q2 and Q3 retraces, holding above pre-bull run levels. As Q4 started, Solana continued to hover within the $110-$180 price range, breaking above this range after the market’s post-election pump. SOL’s momentum propelled the token past its yearly high and successfully reclaimed the $200 barrier. The token continued to climb higher until its new ATH of $263 on November 23. Since then, Solana hovered between the $245-$220 price range, fueling investors’ optimism about the altcoin’s next “price discovery” move. Nonetheless, SOL’s price has taken a blow in the past day alongside Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market. Solana saw an 8.7% correction in the last 24 hours, falling to the $210 support level before dropping below it. The cryptocurrency is now retesting the key $200-$210 zone as support for the first time since breaking past it, falling below the $205 level on Tuesday morning. Crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa shared a possible bearish outlook for SOL’s short-term performance based on the ongoing price retest. Per the post, “SOL weakness has been pretty obvious, and it’s being reflected in the sol shitcoin price action as well.” The analysts explained that the current price action looks seemingly underwhelming, suggesting that holding the $200-$210 region is crucial. Failing to hold this zone would likely send the price to the pre-election resistance level of $180, which has not been tested as support since breaking above it over a month ago. SOL Eyes Higher Targets Similarly, Crypto Jack forecasted a potential fall to the $180-$160 range if SOL fails its retest of the $200 mark as support. However, he considers the over 10% drop a “buy the dip” opportunity for investors. According to his potential play for Solana, the cryptocurrency would bounce to its ATH levels and attempt to break past them. Other market watchers pointed out that SOL is currently retesting the weekly and monthly timeframe resistance as support, which could see Solana go higher “as long as it holds.” Crypto analyst Jelle reaffirmed his $600 target for the cryptocurrency, noting that it “performed incredibly during the first year of the cycle” and will “be a winner again in the coming months.” Related Reading: Cardano Follows 2020 Bullish Pattern – Top Analyst Plans To Take Profits Between $4 And $6 Meanwhile, Bitwise’s latest report predicted that SOL could rally over 200% in 2025.

These bullish projections also came with a vision that this exchange will rise as the world’s most valuable brokerage, exceeding Charles Schwab by next year. “Our prediction: Coinbase stock will trade above $700 per share in 2025 (more than doubling today’s price). That would make them as the most valuable brokerage in the world, surpassing Charles Schwab. The reason? It is more than just a brokerage,” Bitwise stated on the released report The collaboration between Coinbase and USDC has had a positive impact on the company, accounting for $162 million in revenue or an increase of 31%. This projection will continue to rise. A new Layer 2 ( L2 ) network named Base, which builds on the Ethereum blockchain, is now a leader in both transaction and total value lock, with 131 transactions per second (TPS) and $12.9 billion, respectively. Through this L2 project, Base generates revenue of more than tens of millions of dollars every quarter as the capital and ecosystem are expected to grow. Bitwise also noted that staking and custody services are also promising for the company’s future, with $589 million generated revenue. It is expected that both business revenues will rise up to $1 billion.

The trend has continued into December, with BlackRock maintaining its lead as the top purchaser of Bitcoin among ETF providers.

However, as more users successfully processed their airdrops and some chose to sell, the FDV sharply declined, eventually stabilizing at around $5 billion. The Magic Eden $ME token has lost over $9 billion in market cap in about 90 minutes, a decline of nearly 69%. What went wrong? https://t.co/STbf0r2a7K pic.twitter.com/rTVEsQbFS5 — Franklin (@franklinisbored) December 10, 2024 Some users reported losing funds during the claiming process, alleging that their wallets were drained as they navigated the platform’s convoluted steps. Meanwhile, others who managed to claim and sell their tokens celebrated their gains, dismissing criticism as complaints from those who missed out on the opportunity. Industry insiders criticized the airdrop process, suggesting that it deviated from security best practices. Moreover, wallet security experts at Coindesk found that Magic Eden wallets retain users’ recovery phrases and private keys within the app without providing a clear option to delete this sensitive information. “It’s a very bad idea to store this stuff” anywhere digitally, be it locally on one’s own device or – even worse – remotely on a company’s servers,” one crypto-security sleuth going by the pseudonym Ogle remarked. Magic Eden token: What is it? The ME Foundation, which backs the Magic Eden platform, announced that the $ME token went live at 9 a.m. ET on December 10. As the official token for the Magic Eden ecosystem, $ME aims to enhance user engagement across Solana, Bitcoin, and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains. The token is designed to reward users and drive participation in the expanding Magic Eden ecosystem. “We’re incredibly excited for today’s launch and the opportunity to foster a passionate, cross-chain community of users,” said Matt Szenics, Director of the ME Foundation. Today’s the day you’ve been waiting for. $ME is here. Don’t guess — Watch this video below and learn how to claim in mere minutes. You have until February 1st 2025 to claim, any unclaimed tokens will be distributed to stakers. More info on this later. pic.twitter.com/NWFmnCaSEv — Magic Eden 🪄 (@MagicEden) December 10, 2024 “ The $ME token represents the power of on-chain trading applications, and there will be innovative incentives rewarding users for trading all assets on all chains. $ME is becoming a token for on-chain maxis everywhere,” he continued. The token’s total supply is capped at 1 billion, with 12.5% allocated to the airdrop. This initial distribution of 125 million tokens will remain available to users until February 1, 2024. Additionally, 50% of the total supply has been reserved for community incentives, while the remaining 37.5% is allocated to contributors and strategic participants. Magic Eden has positioned $ME as a key component of its strategy to power the on-chain economy, offering tools for cross-chain trading, minting, and wallet protocols. The platform claims that $ME will represent the largest community of users, who can earn rewards for trading assets across all supported chains.

Pepe MAGA (PEPEMAGA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe MAGA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe MAGA by entering its contract address – C3zan7DDUAxZDSLnSxpptmyARsvGAbah4KWQB5QokoFM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEMAGA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/pepe-maga-pepemaga-solana-memecoin-will-rally-18000-ahead-of-first-exchange-listing-while-shib-and-bonk-underperform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

37495238,https://coinpedia.org/?p=391702,1733903123,WazirX Bankruptcy Rumors: Is Nischal Shetty Going to Ditch? Here’s the Truth,"The post WazirX Bankruptcy Rumors: Is Nischal Shetty Going to Ditch? Here’s the Truth appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A wave of rumors about WazirX’s possible bankruptcy has sparked concern among India’s cryptocurrency community. WazirX, once a leader in India’s crypto market, is now surrounded by rumors about key departures, particularly from its co-founder Nischal Shetty. Although there’s no official confirmation, the recent moves within the company suggest the possibility of a planned exit, leaving users uncertain about the future. Are these rumors just noise, or is something much bigger at play? Let’s dive into the details. The Binance-Wazirx Dispute The controversy between WazirX and Binance is at the center of these rumors. While both companies are still publicly connected, neither has made any moves to officially separate. This lack of action leaves WazirX’s future financial stability in question. The situation is further complicated by investigations from the Enforcement Directorate (ED), which are adding pressure on the exchange. Shetty’s New Ventures: Red Flag? Some industry insiders believe that Shetty’s newer projects, Shardeum and Pi42, indicate he may be preparing for a shift in focus. Unlike centralized platforms like Binance, Shetty has launched multiple new projects, leading WazirX users to wonder if he’s still committed to his original venture. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : WazirX Proposes Settlement Plan to Recover From Hack: Will Creditors Approve? , Could Shetty Be Planning to Move On? Critics argue that Shetty’s actions may be part of a broader strategy to step away from WazirX and move towards a decentralized exchange (DEX) model. This could help him distance himself from WazirX’s troubles and start fresh. Rumors suggest a few possible outcomes for WazirX users: New DEX and Token Offers : Users might be directed to a new decentralized exchange with “recovery tokens” and bonus perks similar to the WRX token issued earlier. Partial Recovery of Funds : Users may only receive partial reimbursement of their funds, which would allow WazirX to present a more favorable picture while still declaring some form of recovery. Hamare 100 crore jo #WazirX ne July mein nikale the, woh USDT mein nahi, balki tokens mein lenge bol rahe the. Ab unn tokens ki value 250 crore ho chuki hai. Aur ab WazirX keh raha hai ki ye 250 crore hum apne naye DEX mein use karenge. Market neeche jati toh usdt meh, upar gyi… pic.twitter.com/pc5gLWG3qd — Justice for WazirX Users (@IndiasCrypto) December 10, 2024 What’s Next for WazirX? Many in the Indian crypto community are urging WazirX’s leadership to provide more clarity about the situation. If these rumors are true, it could have serious consequences for India’s rapidly growing crypto industry , especially if WazirX is close to bankruptcy. At this point, WazirX’s future remains uncertain. The Indian crypto community is closely watching the situation, wondering whether these rumors have any truth to them or if they’re just another round of speculation.

37495137,https://coinpedia.org/?p=391704,1733902958,Martial Law Disrupts South Korea’s Crypto Progress to a Standstill,"The post Martial Law Disrupts South Korea’s Crypto Progress to a Standstill appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News South Korea’s cryptocurrency sector is facing an unprecedented setback following the declaration of martial law in early December. The National Assembly has decided to postpone all crypto-related legislative work for now, meaning any major changes in the sector will likely be delayed until at least mid-2025. Crypto Tax Delay: Almost 2 Years One of the biggest decisions to come from this delay is the pushback of crypto taxes. The National Assembly voted to delay a new tax on crypto profits until 2027. The tax, which was originally set to be imposed in January 2025, would have taxed a 22% on profits over $1,750. This decision was passed just before the martial law announcement, which meant the tax law was saved from becoming a reality as planned. Meanwhile, the news of martial law caused a big drop in Bitcoin prices on Upbit, South Korea’s largest exchange. The price of Bitcoin fell sharply by 30% , dropping from ₩88,266,000 ($61,600) to ₩127,000,000 ($88,600) within 30 minutes. No Progress on Key Crypto Laws With martial law in place, the National Assembly has decided to stop all work on important crypto issues. This includes reviewing South Korea’s ban on initial coin offerings (ICOs), deciding whether companies can buy crypto for their balance sheets, and looking at whether crypto-based securities will be allowed. These issues will not be addressed until at least mid-2025. There are growing concerns that more blockchain and crypto companies may leave South Korea for countries with clearer rules. Many crypto businesses are asking the government to set clearer guidelines soon to avoid losing investment to other nations. A Ray of Hope: (FSC) While the government has stopped work on many crypto laws, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) has managed to create some basic rules for corporate crypto accounts.

The theft, uncovered by well-known crypto investigator ZachXBT, involved over 1,700 suspicious USDC transactions, followed by laundering the funds through Polygon and Ethereum. The criminal, using the alias ""Excite,"" has been flaunting luxury purchases online, with metadata suggesting a possible location in Denmark. The attack, which began on April 21, saw the stolen funds split across three wallets, most of which remain inactive. ZachXBT noted that the culprit partially revealed his face in photos shared on social media, providing a lead that could help identify him. However, questions remain about how Coinbase's AML system failed to detect these activities within a 16-hour window. This lapse has raised concerns, especially given Coinbase's past issues with compliance and a $50 million fine for violations last year. Commenters on ZachXBT's posts criticized Coinbase for being overly strict with legitimate users while failing to catch significant criminal activities. This incident follows other challenges for the platform, including recent scams impersonating Coinbase Support and the removal of Bitcoin payments due to operational issues. ZachXBT hinted that others might be involved in the theft, given how the funds were divided. He also emphasized the importance of determining how the hacker bypassed Coinbase’s security measures. The platform’s failure to flag this activity adds to its growing list of vulnerabilities. So far, the victim has not come forward, making it harder to gather details about how the breach occurred.

The proposal, presented by MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor , called for Microsoft to diversify its portfolio by allocating a portion of its reserves to Bitcoin . Saylor argued that Bitcoin, now the seventh-largest global asset, is poised for explosive growth, with its market capitalization projected to surpass $2 trillion in the near future and potentially reach over $200 trillion by 2045. In his presentation, he emphasized Bitcoin’s potential as a transformative investment opportunity, aligning with major market trends. Despite these optimistic projections, Microsoft’s board cautioned against the plan, citing concerns about potential risks and volatility. Shareholders ultimately agreed, voting against the proposal during a meeting held on December 10. The board described Bitcoin investments as ""unnecessary risks"" that do not align with the company’s strategy. Following the vote, Saylor expressed his disappointment on social media, stating, ""Microsoft shareholders will regret this decision in time. Bitcoin doesn’t wait—it simply rewards those who understand its value."" He remains convinced that Bitcoin will continue to redistribute wealth globally as more investors recognize its significance. Meanwhile, Amazon appears to be taking a different stance on cryptocurrency. Stakeholders at the company proposed an ambitious plan to invest a substantial portion of its cash reserves in Bitcoin, signaling a contrasting approach to digital asset adoption among major tech giants. This move highlights the varied strategies corporations are employing when it comes to cryptocurrency investments. Bitcoin’s market briefly reacted to the news, showing slight fluctuations, but it has since stabilized. Microsoft’s stock performance remains unaffected, demonstrating continued growth over the year. In contrast, MicroStrategy has experienced substantial gains, largely attributed to its heavy investment in Bitcoin.

Ferguson currently serves as a commissioner for the antitrust agency. According to his biography, he once clerked for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. “Andrew has a proven record of standing up to Big Tech censorship and protecting Freedom of Speech in our Great Country,” Trump said in a Tuesday statement posted to his Truth Social network . “Andrew will be the most America First and pro-innovation FTC Chair in our Country’s History.” In a statement following the announcement, Ferguson said he was honored to be chosen to lead the agency. “At the FTC, we will end Big Tech’s vendetta against competition and free speech. We will make sure that America is the world’s technological leader and the best place for innovators to bring new ideas to life,” he said in a post on X . Thank you President Trump. Under your leadership, American businesses will become stronger and more competitive, and will better serve workers and consumers, than ever before. I’m honored that you’ve chosen me to be FTC Chairman in your mission to make our country great again.… pic.twitter.com/GxmYWfjpqm — Andrew Ferguson (@AFergusonFTC) December 11, 2024 Ferguson serves as one of the two Republican commissioners on the five-member panel led by Lina Khan. Ferguson, previously the solicitor general of Virginia, was appointed to the commission by President Biden and officially joined the FTC on April 2. The future of FTC under Trump The Federal Trade Commission is responsible for the enforcement of antitrust and consumer protection laws. Khan’s replacement is expected to mean that the FTC will be less stringent in its antitrust enforcement. The new chairman is expected to designate new directors for the FTC’s antitrust and consumer protection divisions. Khan became a lightning rod for Wall Street and Silicon Valley by suing Amazon and Meta and blocking billions of dollars worth of corporate acquisitions, all while alleging anticompetitive behavior. The FTC barred a proposed merger between Korger and Albertsons, two major supermarket chains that executed a $24.6 billion agreement in 2022 during Khan’s tenure. On Tuesday, a judge put the brakes on the merger following a lawsuit from the FTC aimed at preventing the deal, arguing it would result in elevated prices and lowered wages for employees. Donald Trump is on a streak to ensure that no money will leave American Markets, from taxes to tariffs. The mistakes Khan made with the American economy will not be repeated during his tenure. Today, Trump has welcomed billionaire investors to America. On Truth Social, he posted that “Any person or company investing ONE BILLION DOLLARS, OR MORE, in the United States of America, will receive fully expedited approvals and permits, including, but in no way limited to, all Environmental approvals. GET READY TO ROCK!!!” To that, Elon Musk said , “This is awesome.” Lina Khan, the current leader of the FTC, has managed billions of dollars in dismissed corporate acquisitions, provoking the displeasure of Wall Street. Trump focuses on trade in his MAGA agenda Ferguson’s experience could lead to more scrutiny of huge tech corporations. In a statement earlier this month, he urged for the prosecution of “unlawful collision” between web platforms that might hinder “Americans’ ability to exchange ideas freely and openly.” Trump’s reelection has sparked concerns about how his administration will handle ongoing antitrust cases against internet giants such as Apple and Amazon. Google is also awaiting a ruling on whether a federal judge would accept the US government’s suggestion that it be forced to sell Chrome after its search operation was ruled a monopoly. The new administration may also decide to dismiss any ongoing FTC investigations. Last week on X, Ferguson praised Trump’s selection of Gail Slater to head the Justice Department’s antitrust division, noting that Trump highlighted her commitment to pursuing legal action against major tech platforms for purported competition violations. While Trump was expected to replace Khan, certain Republicans, including those tapped to join the Trump administration, have been dubbed “Khanservatives” because they advocate for stricter, not weaker, antitrust enforcement. In February, Vice President-elect JD Vance said that Khan is “one of the few people in the Biden administration who I think is doing a pretty good job.” Deep into trade, Trump also said he is selecting Mark Meador as his pick to be an FTC commissioner. “Mark has also worked as an antitrust enforcer at both the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice Antitrust Division, and in private practice at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP,” Trump said in the post.

Not only that, Binance will also include USDC in its corporate treasury operations, indicating a major shift towards the use of the stablecoin for on-chain financial operations. In return, Circle will equip Binance with the technology, liquidity, and tools necessary to bring users benefits from the USDC infrastructure.

The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYSDFS) granted this certification, marking a significant milestone for Ripple as it ventures into the stablecoin market. Ripple aims to make RLUSD a dependable digital currency option for clients, minimizing the price swings commonly associated with XRP , its flagship asset. This move is part of Ripple’s strategy to expand its services and adapt to New York’s strict regulatory environment. To do so, the company is expected to secure a limited-purpose trust charter, allowing it to offer specific digital asset services without facing the challenges posed by traditional banking regulations. Additionally, Ripple will need a BitLicense, which enables crypto platforms like Coinbase and Robinhood to provide trading and custody services in the state. This approval places Ripple alongside other regulated stablecoin providers such as Paxos (PAX) and Gemini (GUSD). Keith Grossman, president of Enterprise at MoonPay, voiced support for Ripple’s market entry, highlighting the importance of well-regulated companies in reshaping global finance. Garlinghouse also shared that details about RLUSD’s launch, exchange listings, and partnerships will be announced soon , ensuring the public is updated directly by Ripple. In a recent CBS “60 Minutes” interview, Garlinghouse emphasized the need for clear regulatory guidelines to preserve U.S. leadership in the crypto sector . He argued that uncertainty in regulations could drive the industry to countries with weaker oversight. Ripple has consistently advocated for transparent rules, urging policymakers to establish a balanced framework. The Ripple CEO also touched on the political landscape, mentioning President-elect Donald Trump’s evolving views on Bitcoin. Garlinghouse humorously noted that voters were aware of potential conflicts of interest when electing him. He also praised bipartisan efforts in Congress, particularly the Fit 21 bill, which proposes transferring some regulatory responsibilities from the SEC to the CFTC . This legislation aims to ease the regulatory challenges faced by crypto businesses. Regarding the ongoing lawsuit over XRP’s classification as a security, Garlinghouse confidently stated that he does not believe XRP meets the definition of a security, dismissing the allegations as baseless.

Web3 security firm ScamSniffer has warned of a new scam targeting cryptocurrency users by mimicking popular influencers in the space and draining their wallets using stealthy malware. The attack begins when the scammers create fake X accounts posing as popular cryptocurrency influencers and promoting Telegram groups that promise to offer investment advice. These groups are often touted as “exclusive” and are typically promoted under the posts of the influencers that the scammers are imitating to make them look legitimate. When unsuspecting users join the group via the invite link, they are asked to verify using a Telegram verification bot dubbed “OfficialSafeguardBot” which, according to ScammSniffer, “creates artificial urgency” by giving users very little time to complete the captcha. You might also like: Cado Security Labs flags new malware targeting crypto wallets on Windows and macOS During this phony verification process, the bot injects “malicious PowerShell code,” a scripting language used for task automation in Windows, into the victim’s clipboard, and victims are tricked into executing it on Windows as the bot prompts it as a step required to complete the verification process. See below. Telegram verification bot prompting users to run malicious code. Source: ScamSniffer on X According to ScamSniffer, there have been “numerous cases recently” where similar tactics have been used to steal a user’s private keys. The malware has also managed to bypass several antiviruses, with only VirusTotal flagging it as malicious. To protect oneself, it advised users to use hardware wallets, avoid executing unknown commands, and avoid installing unverified software. The report follows an earlier warning for ScamSniffer about a surge in fake X accounts in December. Notably, impersonation accounts have spiked over 87% since November, and two victims lost over $3 million by clicking malicious links promoted via some of these accounts. Over the past months, threat actors have increasingly resorted to using malware designed to drain crypto assets. This surge coincides with Bitcoin’s rally to $100,000 and a broader rise in altcoins, making the crypto sector increasingly lucrative for scammers. On Dec. 9, Cado Security Labs flagged the Realst malware infiltrating users’ systems using a fake meeting application after social engineering them into believing they needed to download the application for a legitimate business opportunity or interaction with a trusted contact. Once deployed , the malware steals crypto assets, browser-stored credentials, banking card details, and other sensitive information. In October, the decentralized finance protocol Radiant Capital lost over $50 million after the systems of some of the platform’s developers were compromised via a zipped PDF file containing malware. The attack involved social engineering, with the infected file being promoted via Telegram by an attacker impersonating a trusted former contractor.

The National Bank of Kyrgyzstan, which will oversee the issuance and operation of the digital som, plans to launch prototype testing in early 2025. Following successful trials, a decision on full implementation is expected by the end of 2026, the report reads. Once adopted, the digital som will serve as legal tender, issued only by the central bank through a specialized platform that manages its distribution, accounting, and security. It’s understood that the digital som platform is designed to support both online and offline transactions, ensuring accessibility even in areas with limited internet connectivity.

37494902,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51866,1733901955,Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse 60 Minutes Interview In Summary,"Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse made a notable appearance on CBS’ 60 Minutes, where he defended Ripple’s role in the cryptocurrency industry and its rising influence in American politics. During the interview , Garlinghouse highlighted Ripple’s significant financial contributions to political campaigns during the 2024 election cycle, emphasizing the importance of supporting pro-crypto candidates across party lines. Ripple and two other crypto firms collectively contributed $144 million to super PACs, backing 62 congressional candidates—29 Republicans and 33 Democrats. With an impressive success rate, 85% of those candidates won their races. “Do I think we had an impact? Absolutely,” Garlinghouse stated. Ripple’s Role in Shaping Political Support The contributions marked a calculated effort by Ripple and its allies to influence congressional elections. One-third of all corporate donations to super PACs during this cycle came from the crypto sector. When asked by interviewer Margaret Brennan whether these actions amounted to “buying elections,” Garlinghouse rejected the idea. He argued that voters made independent decisions but acknowledged Ripple’s financial role in supporting campaigns. “We educated voters, as many industries do, about candidates,” he explained, adding, “We absolutely supercharged candidates with money.” The interview also touched on President Donald Trump’s apparent support for the crypto industry. His administration’s policy direction has become clearer with the nomination of crypto-friendly figures, including Scott Bessent for Treasury Secretary and Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner, to replace Gary Gensler as Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Additionally, Trump created a new White House Crypto Czar role, signaling a commitment to a regulatory framework favorable to digital assets. Ripple’s Legal Battle with the SEC The conversation also addressed Ripple’s ongoing legal dispute with the SEC, which began in December 2020. The SEC’s lawsuit alleges that XRP is an unregistered security. Garlinghouse characterized the lawsuit as part of a broader “war on crypto” led by former SEC Chair Gensler. He noted that Ripple, and some other crypto companies, helped establish the super PAC “Fairshake” in response to regulatory challenges. Garlinghouse revealed that Ripple has spent over $150 million defending itself in court and reiterated that XRP does not meet the definition of a security. “I think I’m reasonably intelligent about something like, ‘What is a security?’ Never once had I considered the possibility that XRP is a security,” he remarked. Despite Garlinghouse’s assertions, critics remain unconvinced. John Reed Stark, a former SEC official, argued that the courts have consistently sided with the SEC in similar cases. Describing the designation of XRP as a security as “an obvious call,” Stark also voiced broader concerns about cryptocurrency’s potential misuse in crimes such as ransomware and money laundering. Garlinghouse countered these criticisms by pointing out that there are bad actors in every industry. “Bernie Madoff went to jail. That doesn’t make every hedge fund manager a criminal,” he said, emphasizing Ripple’s commitment to compliance and regulatory engagement. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Future of Crypto Regulation and XRP’s Resurgence In the interview, Garlinghouse called for regulatory clarity, advocating for crypto regulation to shift from the SEC to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). He argued that the CFTC’s approach would foster innovation while maintaining market integrity. Critics like Stark, however, contend that this would weaken investor protections, as the SEC’s mandate is centered on safeguarding investors. Meanwhile, XRP’s value has remarkably increased, surging over 300% since Election Day and solidifying its position as a leading cryptocurrency. Ripple has already announced an additional $25 million contribution to Fairshake, bringing its total funding to $103 million, to support pro-crypto candidates in future elections. Despite its recent gains, XRP’s price dipped by 5.89% in the last 24 hours, settling at $2.40. While the cryptocurrency industry faces ongoing skepticism from figures like JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and investor Warren Buffett, Garlinghouse pointed to the rapid success of the Bitcoin ETF as evidence of growing acceptance. “It attracted more assets in less time than any ETF ever before,” he said. Ripple’s strategies indicate its determination to remain a major player in shaping the future of cryptocurrency policy and adoption.

The token generation event captured the attention of leading crypto exchanges. Binance, Upbit and Bithumb announced to list ME hours before the launch. Coinbase also joined the listings late Tuesday, the exchange posted on X. https://twitter.com/CoinbaseAssets/status/1866606052403253626 The OKX crypto exchange also started supporting Magic Eden’s native token early Wednesday, per an official announcement . Right after its launch, ME reached an all-time high of $17, according to data from CoinGecko. This brought the value of the airdrop, 125 million ME, to a staggering $2.12 billion, making it the third-largest free token distribution event after Uniswap’s $6.4 billion and ApeCoin’s $3.5 billion airdrops, per CoinGecko data . Despite the notable exchange listings, Magic Eden faced a harsh selloff, a movement expected with token airdrops.

37494604,https://crypto.news/?p=14318247,1733901622,Bitcoin ETFs record $439.5m inflows as total net inflows surpass $34b,"Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the United States recorded their ninth consecutive day of inflows on Dec. 10, with total net inflows into these investment products surpassing $34 billion. According to data from SoSoValue, the 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted $439.56 million in inflows on Tuesday, extending their streak to nine days. Over this period, more than $4 billion has entered these funds. BlackRock’s IBIT led the pack, receiving $295.63 million and dominating the inflows for the eighth straight day. Fidelity’s FBTC followed with $210.48 million, while ARK 21Shares’ ARKB, Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust, and Hashdex’s DEFI added $5.77 million, $6.42 million, and $1.1 million, respectively, contributing to the positive momentum. However, these inflows were partially offset by outflows from Grayscale’s GBTC amounting to $62.82 million, Invesco’s BTCO with $11.56 million, and VanEck’s HODL with $5.45 million. The remaining four BTC ETFs saw zero flows on the day. The latest inflows pushed the cumulative total net inflows for these funds past the $34 billion milestone for the first time. The total trading volume for the 12 Bitcoin ETFs on Dec. 10 stood at $3.78 billion, lower than the $4.35 billion recorded the previous day. At the time of writing, Bitcoin ( BTC ) was trading sideways, hovering just 2.5% below the $100,000 mark.

Some altcoins faced an over 50% pullback in less than 24 hours, which caused a significant switch in market sentiment. Meanwhile, the altcoin market capitalisation has reached some crucial levels, which triggered a massive breakout during the 2021 bull run. Therefore, some more fallout is expected, which may validate the start of the next Altseason. The markets have entered an interesting position, with the altcoins dropping by a large margin while the Bitcoin price barely rose. Currently, most of the altcoins have filled the wicks of yesterday’s wipeout and locked in higher lows. This is believed to be a good indication of where the altcoins may begin to reclaim some lost levels. On the other hand, the Bitcoin dominance dropped below the bullish range but is trying hard to validate a rebound. Will the levels manage to set up a strong recovery? If yes, will Altseason kick off? To analyse the next course of action of the altcoins, the Bitcoin dominance chart plays a major role. A drop in the dominance levels usually triggers the altcoins, while a huge pullback initiates a strong altseason. Presently, the levels have dropped from the rising wedge, which is believed to result in a significant pullback followed by a recovery. However, the historical pattern suggests that dominance is poised for more downfall. Back in 2021, during the bull run, the BTC dominance surged and reached above 70%, which resembles the current rise above 60%. The levels dropped from the rising wedge and consolidated along the support, which helped the BTC price mark a new ATH in 2021 as well as in recent times. Unfortunately, the dominance kept on falling, regardless of the market dynamics, which is expected to repeat in the next few days. Considering the technicals, the RSI has plunged below the average zone for the first time since December 2022, suggesting a drop to the lower threshold. Secondly, the volume has reached the bull run peak levels, and once they calm down, the dominance may begin to move sideways, allowing the altcoins to thrive and maintain a healthy Altseason probably in the first few weeks of 2025 that could persist for the rest of the year.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/the-stage-is-set-for-an-explosive-altseason-this-is-the-last-chance-to-accumulate-altcoins-at-the-dip/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

The crypto market is full of opportunities that come and go faster than the latest TikTok trends. One project that has many investors kicking themselves is Book of Meme’s ICO. It generated buzz, excitement, and plenty of community hype—but for those who missed the initial launch, all hope is not lost. BTFD Coin’s presale is here to save the day. With its soaring numbers, innovative features, and dedicated community, BTFD Coin offers you a second chance to get involved with one of the most exciting meme projects in the market. Over $2.8 million raised, 45 billion coins sold, and 4,200 bulls already on board—BTFD Coin is proving it has momentum. And with its presale now entering new stages, this is the time to strike while the iron’s hot. Missed Book of Meme? Don’t worry. Let’s explore why BTFD Coin deserves your attention (and investment) now.

A community-driven ecosystem focused on decentralised meme utilities, meme NFTs, and community-driven decision-making. All signs pointed toward another potential meme-coin success story, much like the market’s favourite meme giants like Dogecoin and SHIB. But like most hot projects, Book of Meme quickly gained attention and excitement—and many investors flocked to the initial presale (which raised 50% of its current allocation) only to find that entry opportunities came and went in the blink of an eye. Those who didn’t secure their positions in time felt the sting of “what-ifs” as the token’s popularity surged post-launch. If you’re among the many left behind, here’s the good news: BTFD Coin has all the ingredients to become the next big thing. Why BTFD Coin is Your Second Shot at Meme Coin Success This isn’t a project that lives purely on hype or memes alone. It combines staking opportunities, a P2E gaming experience, and serious community support that could position it as a top player in the meme-coin market. Here’s what makes BTFD Coin stand out from the sea of meme-based cryptocurrencies: Play-to-Earn Gaming BTFD Coin integrates a Play-to-Earn gaming experience into its ecosystem. That means users can stake their coins, earn rewards through engaging games, and interact with a variety of blockchain utilities—creating a more active, fun, and rewarding community experience. High Staking Rewards—Up to 90% APY Staking is more than a feature here; it’s an actual financial strategy. BTFD offers stakers an average APY of 90% , meaning you can watch your holdings compound faster than your TikTok feed refreshes.

This isn’t just a token—it’s a full-blown movement backed by a motivated and engaged community.

Put simply? BTFD Coin isn’t just a gamble. It offers real utility, community power, and the kind of opportunity that gets investors excited. And let’s talk about numbers—because numbers matter. Investment Opportunity: $750 Into BTFD Coin’s Presale Let’s say you invested $750 into BTFD Coin’s current presale at the affordable price of $0.0001 per coin. Here’s how things could shape up for you: Initial investment: $750 Price per coin at the current presale rate: $0.0001 Projected price: $0.0006 (conservative projections suggest a target price of $0.0006 post-launch) Number of coins purchased: $750 ÷ $0.0001 = 7,500,000 BTFD coins Potential return at $0.0006: 7,500,000 × $0.0006 = $4,500 Your $750 could potentially turn into $4,500 if BTFD Coin meets its projected market performance. That’s a 6X return for a simple early investment at its presale stage. BTFD Coin is proving to be much more than a meme token. With its unique utilities, active staking program, gaming rewards, and explosive community momentum, this coin could be the kind of underdog investment you’ll thank yourself for later.

37494467,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=108923,1733901318,BTFD Presale Surges with $2.8M Raised as Shiba Inu Eyes Rally and Shiba BoneSwap Drives DeFi – Best Meme Coins to Join in December 2024!,"What if you could be part of a movement where the next crypto sensation isn’t just about holding but also about earning and thriving? Imagine this: you’re at a café, sipping your latte, and overhear someone talking about how they turned a small investment into life-changing profits with meme coins like SHIB and BONE. Meanwhile, you sit there wondering, “Could I have gotten in on this?” Well, guess what—you’re still early, and the opportunity is staring you right in the face. This is the BTFD Coin (BTFD) , a game-changing project that’s redefining the meme coin space. While Shiba Inu is teasing a bullish breakout and BONE is cementing its place in Shibarium’s ecosystem, BTFD has already grabbed headlines with its stellar presale performance. In just under 14 days, the presale raised over $2.8 million, selling more than 45 billion coins to over 4,200 investors. With its P2E game live and staking rewards averaging 90% APY, BTFD isn’t just a coin—it’s a full-blown movement for those ready to seize the moment. Let’s dive into why BTFD, SHIB, and BONE are the best meme coins to join in December 2024, and how you can get in on the action before the next big wave hits. BTFD Coin: Your Golden Ticket to Profit Imagine turning a modest investment into a life-changing sum. With the BTFD presale priced at $0.0001 per coin and set to hit $0.0006 upon listing, early adopters stand to gain massive returns. At its current stage, the presale has sold over 45 billion coins, raised $2.8 million, and captivated more than 4,200 holders. Why BTFD Stands Out BTFD isn’t just another meme coin; it’s a rallying cry for investors who know the power of buying low. Built on Ethereum, it leverages the blockchain’s robust security and scalability to deliver low-cost transactions and unmatched liquidity. Its tokenomics are finely tuned to reward early backers, with 48% of the supply reserved for presale buyers. But here’s the kicker: BTFD’s ecosystem goes beyond holding. It features a live play-to-earn (P2E) game that allows users to earn rewards while navigating through exciting challenges. Plus, with staking rewards averaging 90% APY, investors can compound their gains over time. This is what makes it the top among the best meme coins to join in December 2024! Presale Details Now in its 10th stage, this meme coin presale offers coins at $0.0001. With the total supply capped at 173 billion coins, this is your chance to get in early before the price skyrockets. Let’s crunch the numbers: a $1,500 investment at $0.0001 per coin would net you 15 million BTFD. At $0.0006, that’s a potential value of $9,000—an ROI of 500%. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Bullish Breakout on the Horizon Shiba Inu has been the talk of the town lately, thanks to its 60% price surge over the past month. Currently trading at $0.0000298, SHIB is forming an ascending triangle pattern, a bullish signal that could trigger a 100% rally if resistance levels are broken. SHIB’s momentum is supported by its large-holder concentration, with 73% of its circulating supply controlled by whales and investors holding between 0.1% and 1%. This indicates strong confidence among long-term holders, 76% of whom have retained their investments for over a year. The ecosystem also benefits from SHIB burns and increasing adoption, making it a favourite among meme coin enthusiasts. Over the past week, SHIB recorded $2.16 billion in transactions exceeding $100,000, underscoring its strong appeal to big players. Analysts are optimistic about SHIB’s potential to double in value. If the ascending triangle pattern holds, the coin could hit new highs, making it a top pick for investors looking to diversify their portfolio with a proven performer. Shiba BoneSwap (BONE): The Backbone of Shibarium Shiba BoneSwap (BONE) has carved its niche as the governance token of the Shiba Inu ecosystem. As the exclusive gas fee token for Shibarium, BONE is essential for transactions on the Layer-2 blockchain, giving it intrinsic value beyond speculation. BONE’s integration into Shibarium has driven adoption, while strategic exchange listings like Trive Exchange in June 2024 have enhanced its accessibility. Currently trading at $0.60, BONE has shown resilience despite market fluctuations, with a 5% gain over the past week. With a maximum supply of 250 million tokens and 229.9 million in circulation, BONE offers a solid investment case. Its role in the Shiba Inu ecosystem ensures continuous demand, while the Shib Army’s active governance participation adds a layer of community-driven stability. Why You Shouldn’t Wait If you’re serious about joining the meme coin revolution, these three projects are your best bets for December 2024. BTFD’s presale offers unbeatable entry points with significant upside potential, while SHIB and BONE provide proven track records and ecosystem utility. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out! Opportunities like this are rare. BTFD Coin’s presale is blazing ahead, offering a golden chance to turn $1,500 into $9,000 when it lists at $0.0006. Add Shiba Inu (SHIB), with its potential 100% rally, and Shiba BoneSwap (BONE), driving the Shibarium ecosystem, and you’ve got a trio of winners. The clock’s ticking, and every moment you wait, someone else leaps forward. Join the BTFD presale today and be part of the next crypto success story. These are the best meme coins to join in December 2024—don’t wait to make your move! Join the BTFD Coin today and secure your place in the next crypto success story.

37494151,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=109033,1733900739,Why Analysts Are Comparing This Altcoin to Cardano ADA’s Recent Success,"The price of Cardano ADA surged significantly in recent weeks, reaching $1.22, thanks to growing optimism surrounding its ecosystem and technological advancements. Notably, the successful testing of Hydra, Cardano ADA’s layer-2 scaling solution, which achieved impressive transaction speeds, and the expansion of its (decentralized finance) DeFi ecosystem, which now has nearly $700 million in total value locked (TVL), have contributed to Cardano ADA’s bullish momentum. However, despite Cardano ADA’s success, analysts are placing their bets on Bitgert . Bitgert ($BRISE) has seen its price surge over 100% in the current bull cycle and is still showing a 43% monthly increase. This strong performance has attracted investors looking for high-reward opportunities, with many eyeing the potential for 100x or even 200x returns. Let’s compare both and see which one is a better investment: Bitgert’s Features Bitgert is a high-performance blockchain known for its lightning-fast transaction speeds and low costs. The platform operates with a throughput of 100,000 transactions per second (TPS), significantly higher than most competitors, and charges virtually zero gas fees ($0.0000001 per transaction). This efficiency stems from Bitgert’s use of a Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism. The Bitgert ecosystem is versatile and includes a decentralized exchange (DEX), centralized exchange (CEX), real estate marketplace, and payment gateways. Bitgert supports decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and gaming applications. Cardano ADA’s Features Cardano ADA is a third-generation blockchain platform designed to address scalability, sustainability, and interoperability. Cardano ADA employs a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism called Ouroboros, which makes it more energy-efficient compared to Proof of Work (PoW) platforms. Cardano ADA’s layered architecture separates the settlement and computation layers and improves its scalability. This allows for future upgrades without disrupting the network​. Cardano ADA is distinguished by its research-driven development and peer-reviewed protocols. Cardano ADA’s Plutus smart contract framework enables decentralized application (dApp) development, catering to use cases like DeFi and NFTs. Cardano ADA has also focused on real-world applications, such as Atala PRISM, which facilitates decentralized identity systems in education and governance. Cardano ADA’s governance model, Project Catalyst, empowers ADA holders to participate in network decision-making. Why Bitgert Might Be Better Bitgert excels over Cardano ADA in transaction speed and cost efficiency. While Cardano ADA achieves several hundred transactions per second (TPS) with moderate fees, Bitgert processes up to 100,000 TPS with near-zero fees. This makes Bitgert an attractive option for developers and businesses requiring rapid and cost-effective transactions, particularly in high-frequency applications like gaming and DeFi​. However, Cardano ADA holds an edge in decentralization and long-term sustainability due to its robust PoS mechanism and layered architecture. Bitgert’s use of PoA prioritizes efficiency over decentralization, which may limit Bitgert’s appeal to users valuing trustless systems. Despite this, Bitgert’s rapid expansion into AI, gaming, and the metaverse, positions it as a formidable competitor against more established platforms like Cardano ADA. Conclusion In conclusion, Bitgert takes a clear lead when it comes to speed, affordability, and developer-friendliness. While Cardano ADA focuses on sustainability and decentralization, Bitgert’s focus on practical efficiency and rapid expansion positions it as a significant player in the crypto space. In a booming crypto market, Bitgert proves it’s not just another blockchain—it’s one to watch. Grab your own $BRISE token at Gate.io , KuCoin , MEXC , and Pancakeswap !

Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin is currently trading between $0.41 and $0.50. The recent price movement shows a slight dip, with a 1-week price change of -4.04%. This suggests that bears have been exerting some pressure in the short term. However, over the past month, the coin has surged by 86.19%, indicating strong bullish momentum in the longer term. The 10-day simple moving average is at $0.41, slightly below the 100-day average of $0.44, which could point to consolidation before the next move. Looking ahead, Dogecoin faces its nearest resistance level at $0.54. If bulls can push past this point, the next target could be $0.64. Achieving this would represent an increase of approximately 28% from the current upper price range. On the downside, the nearest support level is at $0.35, with a second support at $0.25. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 38.13, suggesting that the coin is approaching oversold territory, which might attract buyers. The MACD level of -0.0112 indicates a bearish trend, but a shift could occur if buying volume increases. Overall, Dogecoin has the potential to continue its upward trajectory if market conditions turn favorable.

37494034,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=660557,1733900445,"Bitwise Forecast: Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Solana Poised For Record Highs In 2025","In a recent report, crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuer and asset manager Bitwise unveiled bold predictions for Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market by 2025, highlighting the significant performance of major cryptocurrencies throughout this year. A Stellar Year For Bitcoin And Major Cryptos Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $104,000 at the start of the month, marking a staggering increase of 141.72% year-to-date, driven largely by the historic launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States, which amassed $33.56 billion in assets. Other cryptocurrencies also demonstrated impressive gains: Solana (SOL) rose by 127.71%, XRP skyrocketed by 285.23%, and Ethereum (ETH) increased by 75.77%. Notably, crypto-related equities such as MicroStrategy and Coinbase also saw remarkable increases of 525.39% and 97.57%, respectively. Related Reading: Five Weeks, Five Purchases: MicroStrategy Invests Another $2.1 Billion In Bitcoin Beyond price hikes, Bitwise notes that the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies also improved significantly. In the 2024 US elections, crypto-friendly candidates triumphed, enhancing the industry’s prospects. President-elect Donald Trump, who embraced cryptocurrencies in his campaign, pledged to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve and reform the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), have further contributed to the current uptrend. Trump’s nomination of Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary—who has previously described crypto as a vehicle for freedom—further signals a shift in the regulatory environment. Optimistic Predictions For 2025 As Bitwise’s team looks ahead, they express enthusiasm about entering what they term the “Golden Age of Crypto.” Their predictions are grounded in several key factors, including rising institutional adoption, advancements in blockchain technology, and anticipated global stimulus from major central banks. The report specifically projects that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana—the “magnificent three”—will continue to outperform traditional asset classes. In 2024, these cryptocurrencies significantly outpaced the S&P 500, which returned 28.07%, gold at 27.65%, and bonds at a meager 3.40%. Bitwise expects this momentum to carry into 2025, with all three assets setting new all-time highs. The research notes the continuing demand for Bitcoin, which is being pushed by an injection of funds into Bitcoin ETFs, as well as the imminent supply reduction due to the April 2024 Halving. This Halving event is intended to reduce new Bitcoin issuance, hence increasing scarcity. If the US government follows through on its proposal to establish a strategic reserve of one million Bitcoins, Bitwise predicts that Bitcoin’s price will skyrocket to $200,000 or perhaps $500,000. Related Reading: XRP Price Eases Gains: Eyes on The Critical $2 Threshold Despite its strong performance in 2024, Ethereum has experienced hurdles as investors move their attention to Bitcoin and faster-growing blockchains. However, Bitwise predicts a narrative shift for Ethereum in 2025. They believe that activity on Layer 2 (L2) solutions such as Base and Starknet will expand dramatically, as will inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs. The rise of stablecoins and tokenized projects on Ethereum is also expected to pique investors’ interest. The firm predicts a significant increase to a new all-time high of $7,000 for the market’s leading altcoin. Solana, on the other hand, known for its quick rebound following the 2022 market meltdown, is also expected to perform well in 2025. The study attributed Solana’s 2024 spike to a memecoin frenzy, similar to the GameStop trading saga. Looking ahead, Bitwise anticipates that projects will continue to migrate to the Solana network, expanding its ecosystem beyond memecoins. Bitwise anticipates a significant increase, almost tripling the current price record to a new high of $750 per SOL. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $96,000, while Ethereum and Solana are consolidating around $3,662 and $218 respectively.

It currently looks weak daily but its bullish trajectory remains valid on the macro-outlook. Following a higher high and higher low pattern from $120 in September, Sol has seen a major recovery and now appears more bullish on the daily chart following a significant break in the past month. It later lost buzz. However, compared to several altcoins that started to lose momentum this week, Sol has been in a correction mode since the price tested $264 three weeks ago. Although the volatility was so insignificant until yesterday when supply turned heavy due to increasing selling volumes. The bulls defended the key $200 level well and the price recovered a bit, bringing a small relief to the market. Today, the bears reiterate actions and are now charging back to claim more lows from a short-term scale. If supply increases, Sol may drop into the $180 range to locate support before resuming a buy. The rising trendline will likely provide support. A bounce from this trendline should activate a bigger leg up. But as of now, the short-term bulls appeared exhausted on the daily chart. A drop below the trendline could result in a serious breakdown capable of rolling the price back to $140. Regardless of that, Sol’s trend remains bullish from a long-term perspective. We can expect a comeback soon. SOL’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Sol’s bears are currently negotiating the $210 level. If they surpass this key level, there’s support at $194, followed by $183.4, which flipped last month. Today’s high is marked at $221. If Sol recovers above this price level to test the previous weekly $247 resistance before breaking through last month’s $264.4 high, a new high may come around $280 and $300.

Per a CoinDesk report , both pro-crypto nations entered a strategic partnership on Tuesday to work on regional crypto regulation. Juan Carlos Reyes, El Salvador’s leading crypto regulator and president of the Comisión Nacional de Activos Digitales (CNAD), and Roberto Silva, president of Argentina’s Comisión Nacional de Valores (CNV), are leading this initiative. Reyes shared two key objectives of CNAD, in terms of international collaboration. “To share our expertise with international partners, enabling them to harness the benefits of a well-regulated industry,” he noted. “To broaden the international footprint of our regulated companies by forging strategic partnership agreements with nations worldwide.” In a LinkedIn post , Reyes wrote that the joint efforts between the nations will share “knowledge and expertise to support regulatory development and innovation.” “This moment marks an important step towards consolidating our collaboration and reflects our commitment to innovation and progress in the industry.” El Salvador, the first nation to adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender, aims to establish collaborative agreements with nations worldwide. “Our goal is to ensure that, while digital assets flow without barriers, regulation is also harmonious and limitless, promoting a global ecosystem of innovation, security, and prosperity.” Argentina Could Follow El Salvador in Making Bitcoin as Legal Tender The strategic partnership follows a recent prediction by 21 Shares, one of the largest providers of crypto exchange-traded products (ETP). The financial services firm forecasted that countries like Argentina may likely follow El Salvador’s footsteps in Bitcoin Adoption. Per 21 Shares Annual Market Outlook report , Bitcoin’s recent growing recognition as a legit financial asset is luring countries like Argentina to embrace the digital asset. “In 2025, 21Shares research indicates that countries like Argentina could adopt Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset,” the company predicted. Further, El Salvador government has accumulated Bitcoin in its national reserves , with President Bukele frequently purchasing during price dips.

Why Traders Are Selling XRP appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Since December 8, the XRP market has seen a decline of over 10.63%. On December 9 alone, the XRP price slipped by over 15.01%. The market has not yet recovered from the fall. Some think Korean exchanges played a key role in the December 9 price correction. Let’s examine the scenario deeply for clarity. Ready? XRP’s Price Decline and Performance At the start of December, the price of XRP was at around $2.2934. On December 2, it touched a peak of $2.7237. Since then, the momentum has weakened considerably. Between December 3 and 5, the XRP price declined from $2.7237 to $2.2428. Between December 6 and 7, XRP buyers attempted to help the market recover from the fall, but failed miserably. On December 9, with a serious single-day fall of 15.01%, the market touched a low of around $2.2138. The market has not yet recovered from the correction. In the last seven days, Bitcoin (+1.5%), Ethereum (-0.2%), and Solana (-8.3%) have outperformed XRP’s -9.4%. Key Contributors to the XRP Price Drop XRP is one of the top altcoins that have shown impressive growth in the latest crypto bull run . Since November 5, it has displayed a massive surge of over 366.3%. Many consider profit-taking as a key reason for the latest XRP sell-off . Data also supports this argument. Interestingly, reports indicate that Korean platforms played a significant role in accelerating the decline. Amid the current market volatility, many are wondering where XRP is headed next. Read XRP Price Prediction to uncover expert insights and forecast the next big move! Early XRP Sell-Off in South Korean Markets Reports suggest that the sell-off began at 7:45 p.m. UTC on December 9 on Korean exchanges. At the start of December 9, the XRP price was at $2.6005. By the end of that day, it plummeted to a low of $2.2064. Notably, on the same day, the KOSPI index also declined to a monthly low of 2,360.24 KRW. Reports also note that the XRP/KRW showed sharper negative CDV compared to XRP/USD or XRP/USDT. Data strongly suggests that the trend of XRP sell-off began on Korean exchanges, and heavy selling occurred on these exchanges on December 9. Hence, it is fair to assume that the Korean XRP sell-off trend has impacted the XRP market severely. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP News Today: Ripple’s RLUSD Stablecoin Gets NYDFS Approval, Triggers Rally , Instability in Korean Markets Since the beginning of this month, the political climate in South Korea has been highly volatile .

Though its long-term bullish trend remains intact, the price is currently down following a 5% drop in the last 24 hours. Recapping last month’s shockwave across the crypto space that sent several altcoins to a new high, XRP took off from a low of $0.5 and shot up steadily until the price reached a high of $0.29 last week – increasing by 6x within a month. But the buyers became weak and the rally halted. After a three-day drop from that high, the buyers pushed back but failed to sustain pressure above $2.7 due to a rejection last weekend. That led to a serious sell-off yesterday and the price fell to $2 as it started this week bearish. This sell-off came as a retest of the 2021 high that got flipped during last month’s surge. As seen on the daily chart, the price level was rejected and is now trading an inch above it. But from the look of things, more sell-offs are expected as the market setups slowly changes. It has formed a double-top (bearish) pattern on the lower timeframe. If this pattern plays out well, XRP may see 30-50% correction before resume bullish.

42389019,2e4a69e6-3c5d-4a30-8c4e-43cdde798ade,1733899754,Bitcoin’s $100K Breakout Pause Likely Due to Liquidity Factors and Nvidia's Stalled Rally,"For the third week, bitcoin (BTC) remains locked in a price range between $90,000 and $100,000, punctuated only by Dec. 5's short-lived rise into six figures. This indecisive price action might have left traders feeling uninspired, with two key reasons holding back the upside.  First, the influx of liquidity into the crypto market through channels like spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has significantly slowed, taking the wind out of the bullish momentum.  The weekly rate of change in the so-called market liquidity impulse index, which tracks stablecoin mints, inflows into BTC ETFs and changes in futures market parameters, has more than halved to $7 billion from highs above $15 billion seen early last month, according to data tracked by 10x Research.  ""This slowdown in liquidity growth may partially explain why bitcoin is struggling to sustain levels above $100,000,"" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said in a note to clients Wednesday.  The liquidity indicator has chalked out lower highs of late, diverging bearishly from BTC's price.  Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to an external reference like the U.S. dollar and are widely used to fund crypto purchases. Meanwhile, ETFs are preferred investment vehicles for those looking to take exposure to the cryptocurrency without owning it. The same can be said about CME's cash-settled futures.  The other reason, overlooked by most pundits, is the slowdown in the uptrend in shares in chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), the world's biggest company. Since the debut of ChatGPT in late 2022, NVDA has emerged as a bellwether for all things AI and risk assets in general.  BTC and NVDA bottomed out in late 2022 and boasted a strong positive correlation since then, barring the summer, when supply overhang fears kept BTC from tracking NVDA higher. As of writing, the three-month correlation between the two was 0.6.  Analysts at TheMarketEar believe BTC, with its post-U.S. election surge from $70,000 to $100,000, has caught up with NVDA   ""Same psychology; winners like winners. BTC has 'caught up' to NVDA. They have little fundamentals in common but are driven by similar psychology,"" analysts at TheMarketEar said in a note to clients, adding that NVDA is one of the few stocks that has outperformed BTC this year and over the last five years.  While BTC has risen 130% this year, NVDA has gained 172%, according to data source TradingView.  NVDA's uptrend, however, has run out of steam since mid-November, with prices now teasing a bearish reversal pattern for heads and shoulders. Besides, the one-year put-call skew now shows calls trading at par with puts, exhibiting a neutral sentiment as opposed to a strong call (bullish) bias early this year, according to data source Market Chameleon.  That said, bullish excesses have been crowded out from the crypto market, as noted in Tuesday's edition of the Crypto Daybook Americas. With the market normalized to more healthy leverage levels, we could see BTC having another go at the $100,000 mark, but sustainability of the breakout likely depends on liquidity inflows and broader risk sentiment.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX | RESEARCH,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/11/bitcoin-s-100-k-breakout-pause-likely-due-to-liquidity-factors-and-nvidias-stalled-rally,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/772d1d0caa3e95bd0c4af852b06e562c75766a83-1280x850.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In their report, Hougan and Rasmussen predict Bitcoin (BTC) could surpass $200,000 by the end of 2025. They further speculate that Bitcoin might reach $500,000 if the United States adopts a strategic Bitcoin reserve as proposed by Senator Cynthia Lummis, with the government purchasing one million BTC over five years. Even without such a reserve, they believe Bitcoin could eventually eclipse gold’s $18 trillion market capitalization, a milestone they anticipate by 2029. Ethereum (ETH) is also expected to perform strongly, with its price potentially hitting $7,000 next year. The surge would be driven by increased activity on Ethereum Layer 2 networks, inflows from spot Ether ETFs, and expanding use of tokenized assets and stablecoins. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) is predicted to rise significantly, with its price forecasted to reach $750, a 250% increase from its current valuation. 2025 PREDICTION: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana will hit new all-time highs. Our price targets for each: Bitcoin: $200,000 Ethereum: $7,000 Solana: $750 Note: Predictions are not guarantees and are not investment advice. pic.twitter.com/ZDRGbuJWIJ — Bitwise (@BitwiseInvest) December 10, 2024 Bitwise expects the growth to stem from new high-profile projects launching on the network. Bitwise foresees Coinbase’s stock price more than doubling to $700, positioning the company as the most valuable brokerage platform by overtaking Charles Schwab. The duo attributes this growth to Coinbase’s diverse revenue streams, including its Ethereum Layer 2 Base, staking services, and stablecoin operations. They also expect Coinbase to gain a spot in the S&P 500 index alongside MicroStrategy’s potential inclusion in the Nasdaq-100. U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs to Grow Even More Additionally, the analysts project substantial growth for U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs , predicting inflows to surpass $33.6 billion from this year. They emphasize that major wealth management firms, including Morgan Stanley and Bank of America, are likely to introduce crypto products to clients in 2025, further accelerating adoption. Bitwise also highlights the rapid rise of tokenized real-world assets, predicting their value will grow from $13 billion to $50 billion in 2025. They cite benefits such as instant settlement, 24/7 liquidity, and lower costs compared to traditional securitization. In another noteworthy forecast, Bitwise anticipates an “even bigger meme coin mania” in 2025, driven by artificial intelligence (AI). The influence of AI on meme coins has already been demonstrated, with AI-powered promotions helping obscure tokens like GOAT achieve billion-dollar market caps. The report projects that the stablecoin market will double to $400 billion in 2025, aided by anticipated U.S. legislation that provides clearer regulatory guidelines. Furthermore, the Department of Labor is expected to ease restrictions on including crypto in 401(k) retirement plans, opening new avenues for institutional capital.

Raydium(~$125B) outperformed Uniswap (~$91B) in monthly DEX volume by almost 30%. Raydium’s success began in October, largely attributed to the platform’s consistent capture of over 60% of Solana’s daily DEX volume. The growth of Raydium reflected Solana’s broader trend of surpassing Ethereum’s daily DEX volume. Solana’s 50% share of monthly DEX volume across all chains was nearly 175% more than Ethereum’s 18% share in November. Raydium’s V3 launch in March and memecoin trading in November catalyzed the DEX’s rise to the leading volume share on Solana. Solana’s Raydium beats Ethereum’s Uniswap in DEX volume supremacy In October, @RaydiumProtocol emerged as the leading DEX by trading volume across all chains. This trend accelerated in November, with Raydium processing $124.6 billion in monthly volume, surpassing Uniswap's $90.5 billion by 30%. pic.twitter.com/fpmyaye7YC — Messari (@MessariCrypto) December 10, 2024 A report published by Kreiser on December 10th revealed that Raydium flipped Uniswap to become the top DEX in daily and monthly trading volumes for two straight months. The report highlighted that Raydium’s journey to the top of DEX rankings began in October, which was marked by strategic developments and consistent growth. Raydium became the number one DEX by volume across all chains in October, and the trend was accelerated in November when it outperformed Uniswap by roughly $34.5 billion. Kreiser’s report noted that the shift reflected Raydium’s strength against other Solana DEXs and Solana’s increasing global share of DEX volume, which stood at ~49% as of November. “A key factor in Raydium’s ascent has been its continuous innovation…Solana’s high throughput and low transaction costs have made it an attractive alternative to Ethereum, which has faced challenges with high gas fees and network congestion.” – Matt Kreiser Raydium’s share of Solana DEX volume this year grew substantially from March onwards as the platform consistently recorded higher daily volume than its main competitor, Solana Orca. Q3 of 2024 marked Raydium’s first quarter, leading Solana’s daily DEX volume and its second straight quarter, topping the daily DEX volume since 2022. According to Kreiser, this led to a migration of users and liquidity to Solana-based DEXs like Raydium. Memecoin trading and strategic upgrades catalyze Raydium’s success Kreiser claimed that the surge in memecoin trading was the most significant recent driver of Raydium’s DEX volume. He added that Raydium’s synergy with Solana’s memecoin launchpad Pump.fun also amplified the platform’s rise to the top. Kreiser disclosed that $12K was added to Raydium’s standard AMM pool when meme tokens on Pump.fun reached a market cap of $69K to create a consistent flow of new liquidity and trading opportunities. Raydium averaged nearly $2 billion in daily memecoin trading in the month of November following Trump’s re-election. The figure almost tripled the average memecoin trading volume in October before the elections. Memecoin trading volume as a percentage of Raydium’s total daily volume steadily increased from 2% in November 2023 to 65% in November 2024, highlighting the growing importance of memecoin trading on Raydium. The platform’s March release of its V3 user interface in beta introduced a new portfolio page for users to view and manage liquidity positions. According to Kreiser, the liquidity page consolidated all Raydium’s liquidity pools in one place, supported exact swap amounts, and provided charts for all tradable token pairs. Raydium V3 fully launched in May alongside the revamped CPMM (constant product market maker) pools that supported the Token-2022 token program and included a built-in price oracle. Raydium’s CPMM pools offered uniform liquidity distribution and asset pricing from zero to infinity, just like its legacy standard AMM.

37494901,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51864,1733899178,Here Is Why RLUSD Is a Very Important Component of Ripple,"In a recent tweet, Vincent Van Code, a prominent software engineer and crypto enthusiast, provided a detailed analysis of Ripple’s evolving ecosystem. Vincent emphasized the significance of RLUSD, a regulated stablecoin, and its integration into Ripple’s network, alongside the broader adoption of the XRP Ledger (XRPL). His insights shed light on the intricate interplay between RLUSD, and XRP, and the mechanisms driving Ripple’s vision for global financial infrastructure. RLUSD: A Stablecoin for Institutional Integration Van Code highlighted RLUSD as a cornerstone of Ripple’s operations, noting its potential to transform the interface between banks and the Ripple network. RLUSD, as a heavily regulated and compliant stablecoin, is designed to meet the stringent requirements of traditional financial institutions. Banks can hold RLUSD as an asset on their balance sheets and use it to facilitate cross-border payments. By leveraging RLUSD, Ripple aims to bridge the gap between traditional finance and blockchain technology. Its compliance-friendly nature makes it a reliable option for institutions, enabling participation in trade markets, including commodities like oil and grains. This positions RLUSD as a critical component for financial operations and broader market participation. XRPL’s Role in Global Financial Transformation Van Code also underscored the importance of the XRP Ledger (XRPL) in Ripple’s strategy. The XRPL enables native token conversion through decentralized exchange (DEX) and automated market maker (AMM) functionalities. These features facilitate seamless cross-border payments across over 80 fiat currencies via on/off ramps. He explained that Ripple’s ultimate goal extends beyond building a proprietary payments network. Instead, Ripple aims to promote the adoption of the XRPL on a global scale. This open-access vision allows any entity to leverage the XRPL, positioning XRP as the bridge and reserve currency for transactions. This approach fosters decentralization and enables independent entities to create stablecoins or participate in liquidity pools, attracting retail investors seeking consistent revenue streams. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP Price Dynamics and Supply Constraints Responding to a query about XRP’s price implications, Van Code outlined factors that could positively impact its valuation. He highlighted that on/off ramps and AMM pools would require significant XRP holdings, effectively reducing circulating supply. With mass adoption, institutions and participants would accumulate substantial XRP reserves, creating a supply bottleneck. Van Code noted that despite a circulating supply of approximately 50 billion XRP, only 3–4 billion XRP are actively utilized within Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) network. Considering the scale of global transactions—exceeding $500 billion daily—the demand for XRP could far outweigh its availability, driving its price upward. A Broader Vision Van Code’s commentary reflects Ripple’s dual objectives: advancing its payments network and fostering XRPL adoption. By prioritizing both regulated assets like RLUSD and XRP’s utility , Ripple aims to establish a decentralized yet cohesive financial ecosystem. He concluded with a reminder for XRP holders: short-term market fluctuations should not overshadow the long-term potential of Ripple’s ecosystem. His insights serve as an educational lens for understanding the intricacies of blockchain’s integration with traditional finance.

37493450,https://coinpedia.org/?p=391659,1733899166,Telegram Gaming vs. Solana Meme Coins: Which to Pick for 100x Gains?,"The post Telegram Gaming vs. Solana Meme Coins: Which to Pick for 100x Gains? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News While Solana meme coins like BONK and dogwifhat have dominated headlines, a new contender is emerging from an unexpected corner: Telegram gaming. As the crypto market heats up amid Trump’s return to the presidency, investors are weighing their options for the next potential 100x opportunity. Dogizen, having already raised $1.4m in its presale, is positioning itself as a potential future star vs. Solana’s meme coin world. Why Telegram Gaming Could Outperform Meme Tokens The Telegram gaming sector has quietly amassed a $1.3 billion market cap in around 6 months, demonstrating remarkable growth potential with relatively few players. Telegram gaming offers fresh territory for explosive gains, unlike the more saturated Solana meme coin landscape. Plus, Dogizen stands out further by conducting the first-ever Telegram ICO, directly accessing a massive user base of 950 million people through a trusted platform. Also, while Solana-based tokens can require complex wallet setups and multiple platforms for trading, Telegram games offer a seamless, single-app experience thanks to the TON wallet’s integration with Telegram. This accessibility and easy referral of Telegram games between Telegram users creates a powerful, largely untapped growth engine. Dogizen’s Long-term Edge While many Solana meme coins rely purely on social media momentum, Dogizen is developing a comprehensive ecosystem within the rapidly growing GameFi sector, projected to expand at an eye-watering 27% CAGR over the next eight years. The Dogizen Universe will combine a gaming launchpad, arcade, and SDK development tools. This means Dogizen can expand its dominance within Telegram gaming as both the GameFi and Telegram gaming sectors grow beyond typical meme coin price cycles. Growth Catalysts Give The Edge Currently priced at just $0.000077, Dogizen offers early-stage access to a project with solid growth drivers. Combining GameFi expansion, Telegram’s growing gaming sector, and the rise of the TON blockchain creates a unique opportunity for projects in a less saturated marketplace. The success of TON, evidenced by its 170% year-to-date gains, provides additional tailwinds for Dogizen, and as the ecosystem expands to include more games, applications, and NFT support, early participants in quality projects stand to benefit significantly. The potential for a future Binance listing, which historically has driven massive surges in listed token prices, is also a cause for excitement. What’s The Best Crypto Investment Right Now? Recent predictions suggest that TON-based projects could outperform in the coming years. While Solana meme coins have proven their potential, with tokens like Bonk achieving remarkable gains, Dogizen’s positioning as the first Telegram ICO, combined with its comprehensive ecosystem approach and strategic token distribution, presents a strong case for superior long-term performance. The project’s modest initial market cap means it requires far less capital to achieve significant price appreciation than established Solana meme coins. A move to a $500 million market cap—a level already achieved by some less advanced competitors—would represent a 50x gain from current levels. The Dogizen presale is underway.

The South Korean won ( USD:KRW ) strengthened toward 1,430 per dollar, recovering losses from a more than two-year low in the previous session, after government authorities pledged active measures to stabilize markets amid political uncertainty.

Crypto King Musk (MUSKKING), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKKING is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Crypto King Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crypto King Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Crypto King Musk launched with over $7,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Crypto King Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Crypto King Musk by entering its contract address – v2jWiNpR1m8gHARdM39GosZ8muaxZpowpBgWgWTSCev – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKKING.

It’s more than just an interesting trend. Recent changes in Mean Dollar Invested Age (MDIA) for Bitcoin (BTC), XRP, and Dogecoin (DOGE) show something important. They hint at a possible market rally. These movements aren’t random. They show increased activity that could shake things up for investors. Let’s look closer to understand what dormant coins are moving and why it’s important. What Is MDIA, and Why Does It Matter? MDIA, or Mean Dollar Invested Age, measures how long coins stay idle in wallets. Think of it as tracking the “age” of money. When MDIA goes down, it means coins are being moved more frequently. This usually reflects rising confidence or preparation for trading. Why is this important? More movement means higher liquidity, which often sparks trading activity. In the past, lower MDIA has often signaled bullish trends in the market. On the other hand, a rising MDIA suggests coins are sitting still, often signaling market uncertainty or a bearish phase. Breaking Down the Recent Data Here’s what the numbers are showing us: Bitcoin (BTC): Over the past 60 weeks, BTC’s MDIA dropped by 31%. This indicates significant wallet activity after a period of dormancy. XRP: In just 14 weeks, XRP’s MDIA fell by 22%. Compared to Bitcoin, this shows quicker circulation. Dogecoin (DOGE): DOGE’s MDIA plunged 31% in only eight weeks. This sharp decline suggests aggressive moves by long-term holders. One of the most overlooked metrics in crypto, Mean Dollar Invested Age is flashing a bullish signal despite the market-wide retrace this week. The Mean Age of investment for: BTC is 439 days (31% younger in 60 weeks) XRP is 865 days (22% younger in 14 weeks) DOGE is… pic.twitter.com/iTCC5wWA0S — Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 11, 2024 Across all these networks, MDIA lines are trending downward. This is important because it hints at more market activity and possible price increases. In the past, this pattern has often lined up with price increases during bull runs. For example, both the 2017 and 2021 rallies showed similar trends before prices surged. Historical Patterns and Investor Insights If we look back, major bull markets always coincide with falling MDIA. It happened in 2017 and again in 2021. When holders start moving their coins, it’s often a sign of growing confidence in the market’s future. However, the reverse is also true. Rising MDIA tends to mark the end of bullish phases, as coins become idle again. What does this mean for investors right now? While short-term price swings are inevitable, these MDIA trends suggest optimism for the mid-to-long term. The dormant coins are moving—a good sign of market momentum. What to Expect MDIA might not be the most popular metric, but it’s one worth watching. After all, who doesn’t want an extra tool to spot market trends early? For Bitcoin, XRP, and Dogecoin, current trends point to increased activity and the possibility of upcoming rallies. While no single indicator can predict the future, the historical importance of MDIA is hard to overlook. Keep tracking these trends. They might just hint at what’s coming next.",POSITIVE,BTC | DOGE | XRP,BTC | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/dormant-coins-are-moving-bitcoin-xrp-and-dogecoin-show-bullish-signs/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png
37493254,https://coinpedia.org/?p=391639,1733898714,Ethereum and Solana Beware: Is a New Blockchain Revolution About to Unfold?,"The post Ethereum and Solana Beware: Is a New Blockchain Revolution About to Unfold? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The blockchain landscape is buzzing with excitement as whispers of a groundbreaking new player circulate among enthusiasts and investors alike. While Ethereum and Solana have dominated the conversation with their scalability, smart contracts, and robust ecosystems, a disruptive force may be gearing up to redefine the space. As the crypto community braces for 2024, a new blockchain revolution could be on the horizon—one that merges advanced technology with decentralization in ways we’ve never seen before. Lightchain Protocol AI Presale The Current Landscape Ethereum and Solana’s Strengths Ethereum, often called the “king of smart contracts,” continues to lead the decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT space. With its transition to Ethereum 2.0 and the adoption of Proof of Stake (PoS), it has significantly reduced energy consumption and improved scalability. Solana, on the other hand, offers unparalleled transaction speed and low fees, making it a favorite for developers and projects focused on real-time applications. Despite these advancements, both platforms face challenges: Ethereum: High gas fees during periods of network congestion and the complexity of scaling solutions like Layer 2s. Solana: Concerns over centralization and occasional network outages that disrupt usability. These limitations have left the door open for innovative competitors to capture market share. What the Market Needs A Blend of Innovation and Accessibility The next major blockchain is expected to address several pressing issues: Scalability Without Compromise: Seamless handling of millions of transactions without sacrificing speed or decentralization. Energy Efficiency: Leveraging eco-friendly consensus mechanisms to counteract the energy-intensive practices of older chains. Advanced Integration: The ability to incorporate emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, enabling smarter dApps and improved user experiences. Equitable Participation: Ensuring that individuals with varying levels of resources can contribute meaningfully to the network. A new blockchain that delivers on these fronts would not only compete with Ethereum and Solana but also redefine the benchmarks for what a decentralized ecosystem can achieve. Whispers of a New Contender Speculation abounds about a blockchain project that claims to bridge the gap between blockchain and artificial intelligence, potentially transforming industries beyond traditional crypto markets. With a focus on privacy, transparency, and cutting-edge consensus algorithms, this new entrant could disrupt the status quo. Early reports suggest features like: A next-gen consensus mechanism that rewards meaningful contributions rather than merely staking or mining power. Privacy-preserving computation through cryptographic techniques, ensuring data security while fostering collaboration. Developer-friendly tools to accelerate the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) across industries. Why the Crypto Community Should Watch Closely If this rumored blockchain lives up to its promise, it could set a new standard for decentralization, scalability, and sustainability. Ethereum and Solana, while groundbreaking in their own rights, might struggle to keep pace with a platform that seamlessly integrates AI and blockchain technology. Lightchain Protocol AI Presale Investors and developers should keep an eye out for announcements in the coming months. As 2024 progresses, the crypto world may witness a seismic shift that challenges Ethereum and Solana’s dominance. With the ever-evolving nature of blockchain technology, this could be the revolution the space has been waiting for. Next Big Thing? While Ethereum and Solana continue to innovate, the blockchain revolution is far from over. A new contender could emerge to address the limitations of today’s platforms and propel the industry into its next era. The question remains: are Ethereum and Solana ready for the challenge? Stay tuned as more details about this mysterious new blockchain emerge. For now, one thing is certain—the blockchain ecosystem is poised for its most exciting chapter yet.

Through the partnership, Circle's USDC will be more extensively available to over 240 million customers for trading, savings and payments. Binance will also adopt the second-largest stablecoin as ""a vital dollar stablecoin"" for its own corporate treasury, according to a press release.  ""Through our strategic partnership, our users will have even more opportunities to use USDC on our platform, including more USDC trading pairs, special promotions on USDC across trading, and other products on Binance,"" Binance CEO Richard Teng said in a statement.  Staunch competition for growth exists between Circle, which has $40 billion worth of USDC in circulation, and its bigger rival Tether, whose USDT stablecoin has a market capitalization of about $140 billion.  Circle has typically cast itself as the more regulated stablecoin, so the high-profile tie-up suggests Binance is charting a path that complies with global regulation. Binance settled U.S. allegations last year by paying more than $4 billion.  Asked if this was a conscious choice to be more compliant with regulations, a Binance spokesperson said via email: ""Our users want choices. We always work with multiple stablecoins. Today we support USDT, USDC, FDUSD, and a bunch of others. And we will continue to work with multiple stablecoin issuers or creators.""  As well as a tool for simply buying and selling other cryptocurrencies, U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins can be used to hedge inflation in developing countries or facilitate lower-cost and efficient remittances, a Binance spokesperson said. Each USDC and USDT token is worth close to $1.  ""With Binance rapidly becoming the world's leading financial super app, and stablecoin adoption and utility at the core of this future financial system, this is a tremendous opportunity for USDC as it becomes ubiquitous on the Binance platform,"" Jeremy Allaire, chairman and CEO of Circle, said in a statement.  Also in the UAE this week, Circle established an Abu Dhabi partnership with LuLu Financial Holdings to facilitate remittances and cross-border payments with USDC.

The Nasdaq 100, which includes the largest non-financial companies, might soon see MicroStrategy join its ranks, replacing underperforming firms like Moderna. The official announcement is expected this week, with inclusion set for December 23, according to Bloomberg analysts. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Bet Pays Off James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas both pointed out that MicroStrategy’s rise has been linked to its decision to hold large amounts of Bitcoin. Since adopting a Bitcoin-first strategy in 2020, the company has accumulated over 423,000 Bitcoin, making it a prominent player in the crypto space. The move has made them traditional Wall Street investors. As a result, MicroStrategy’s influence has grown, and its stock has surged, with its market value increasing from $54.8 billion to $82 billion in just a month. Inclusion into the Nasdaq 100 MicroStrategy is on track to meet the strict criteria required for inclusion in the Nasdaq 100. To qualify, companies must have been trading on the exchange for at least two years and must have a daily trading volume of at least 200,000 shares. MicroStrategy, under the leadership of Chairman Michael Saylor, fulfills these conditions. Analysts predict that if the company is included, it would become the 40th largest holding in the Nasdaq 100, with a weighting of around 0.47%. This would also attract significant investment, with $2.1 billion in ETF shares expected to flow into the company. A Leap of Faith MicroStrategy’s potential inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 is a big milestone for both crypto and traditional finance. By holding large amounts of Bitcoin, the company has sparked interest from other tech firms like Tesla and Metaplanet. Its stock has surged 450% this year, making it a key link between crypto and the stock market. While it faces challenges in joining the S&P 500 due to profitability rules, changes in Bitcoin accounting by 2025 could make that possible. On the Downside… Despite the positive vibes, MicroStrategy’s stock MSTR’s price could face significant ups and downs due to its close ties with Bitcoin which is hanging around $97k. The company’s market value is partly based on a “premium” over its Bitcoin holdings. If this premium disappears, analysts warn that its stock could drop sharply, potentially below $170 per share. This risk comes from Bitcoin’s price movements, as MicroStrategy owns a large amount of the cryptocurrency. Last month, the company’s shares reached about $543, which means there’s a potential for big losses if the stock price drops. This volatility might make some investors think twice before buying.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/microstrategy-set-to-join-nasdaq-100-as-bitcoin-strategy-pays-off/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Is this a good time to buy, or should traders await a bigger dip? Turbo Pumps On Coinbase Listing and AI Boom The strength behind Turbo’s recent pump is two-fold. First, this project was just listed on Coinbase, which will expose it to tens of millions of platform users who didn’t previously have access. Unsurprisingly, this triggered a sharp price uprising. Turbo was also listed on Binance in September, so it’s now available on the two largest centralized exchanges. The second reason for Turbo’s strength is the rising demand for AI-related cryptos. Turbo claims to be the first AI-created meme coin, launched in 2023. This historical claim works in its favor as the AI meme coin sector grows, and it’s blistering hot right now. It's literally all about AI. You don't hold enough AI coins. https://t.co/wuaNam6qiu — Kaduna (@CryptoKaduna) December 9, 2024 This year, AI-agent meme coins such as Goatseus Maximimus and ACT I: The AI Propehcy have emerged, and netizens are continually exploring new blockchain applications using them.

The AI & Meme train does not stop. pic.twitter.com/CBLsXWRu0n — Kaito AI (@_kaitoai) December 8, 2024 This creates a rising tide for AI-related meme coins, from which Turbo is benefitting. However, unlike AI-agent meme coins, Turbo lacks utility. Traders must consider this since it may suppress its growth potential amidst the AI meme coin boom. But what do the charts say? Turbo Uptrend Not Over Yet Turbo is currently trading at $0.011, down 11% today, up 48% this week, and up 18% this month. While today’s sell-off may raise concerns, analysts believe the uptrend will continue in the weeks ahead. Trader Sxei says that Turbo is preparing for its next leg up, which will take it to highs of $0.015. However, on a higher time scale, the analyst suggests even more gains are at play, predicting highs of $0.06. $Turbo just printed a higher high, confirming the DCL on November 26th. It was a failed cycle, but with a higher high im not worried. pic.twitter.com/9MdZGPiMLJ — Martix (@martinxi5u4) December 7, 2024 Cryptomojo agrees with Sxei’s near-term target, noting that Turbo has broken a descending channel resistance level and will now veer toward $0.015. With the rise of the AI meme coin sector and Turbo’s recent strength, a move toward $0.015 is certainly achievable in the short term. In the long term, Sxei’s $0.06 target could prove a bull market high for the frog-themed AI meme coin. But as Turbo shows strength, another frog-themed meme coin has emerged and is making huge early progress. It’s called Wall Street Pepe, and it’s currently undergoing a presale. Is Wall Street Pepe The Next Big Frog Meme Coin? Turbo does very little for its holders besides being a meme coin. However, Wall Street Pepe is making a name by leveling up its community’s ability to make cash. Encapsulating Pepe coin’s nonchalant demeanor and Jordan Belfort’s electric ambition, Wall Street Pepe is creating an army of investors who choose rich. The project is undergoing a presale and has raised $3.5 million so far. Wall Street Pepe is more than a meme coin.

Meanwhile, Ray Dalio recently backed Bitcoin and gold as hedges against a looming debt crisis, and Eric Trump predicted that Bitcoin could reach $1 million. Bitcoin mining firm MARA Holdings expanded its Bitcoin holdings to 40,435 BTC, valued at $3.92 billion, and achieved a record-breaking 50 EH/s hashrate. Microsoft Sticks to Traditional Treasury Strategy Over Bitcoin Microsoft shareholders rejected a proposal to add Bitcoin (BTC) to the company’s balance sheet during the annual shareholder meeting on Dec. 10. The resolution was put forth by the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), a pro-free-market think tank, and argued that adopting Bitcoin would diversify profits and enhance shareholder value. The proposal suggested allocating 1% to 5% of Microsoft’s profits to Bitcoin investments and pointed out the potential of Bitcoin as a transformative financial asset. The proposal also claimed it could create trillions in value while mitigating risks for shareholders. During the meeting, NCPPR presented a pre-recorded video supporting its proposal. The video shed some light on Bitcoin’s growing institutional adoption, and mentioned BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF and MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy as examples. The think tank described Bitcoin as volatile but maintained that ignoring it could jeopardize shareholder interests. Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor also addressed Microsoft’s board, and shared that Bitcoin could add close to $5 trillion to the company’s market cap. Despite these arguments, Microsoft’s board dismissed the proposal as unnecessary due to its existing robust processes for managing corporate treasury to ensure stability and predictability. In its filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the board specifically referred to the risks associated with Bitcoin’s volatility and shared that it is very confident in the company’s current strategies for long-term shareholder benefit. The board also dismissed comparisons to MicroStrategy due to some differences in the firms’ approaches to the cryptocurrency market. Shareholders ultimately aligned with the board’s guidance by voting against the resolution. The NCPPR pursued similar initiatives with other major corporations. On Dec. 8, the group submitted a proposal to Amazon, and suggested that Bitcoin could serve as a hedge against inflation and protect shareholder value. This proposal will be reviewed during Amazon’s shareholder meeting in April of 2025. Ray Dalio Warns of Debt Crisis and Backs Bitcoin Rumors suggest that people and companies not getting on the Bitcoin train now might regret it soon. Billionaire investor Ray Dalio recently voiced some of his concerns about a looming global financial crisis tied to unsustainable debt levels, and urged a pivot toward hard assets like Bitcoin and gold. At a financial conference in Abu Dhabi, Dalio, who is the founder of Bridgewater Associates, spoke about the unprecedented indebtedness in major economies like the United States and China. He warned that the current trajectory could result in a debt crisis and a big decline in the value of money in the years ahead. Ray Dalio (Source: South China Morning Post ) Dalio advised people to steer clear of debt assets, including bonds, and placed emphasis on the importance of focusing on broader economic forces rather than daily market fluctuations. He also believes in the value of hard money, and suggested gold and Bitcoin as viable options for investors looking to hedge against inflation and economic instability. While Dalio previously doubted the potential of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, he recently shifted his stance by advocating for its inclusion in investment portfolios. In 2022, he even recommended allocating up to 2% of a portfolio to Bitcoin alongside gold to counter inflationary pressures. This endorsement happened amid broader debates about Bitcoin’s role in national financial strategies. Gold advocate Peter Schiff recently called on the Biden administration to sell all Bitcoin held by the U.S. government, and argued that a move like that could reduce the 2024 budget deficit and counter what he described as the harmful idea of establishing a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Eric Trump Predicts Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million Eric Trump, the executive vice president of the Trump Organization and son of President-elect Donald Trump, shared his very optimistic vision for Bitcoin during a keynote speech at the Bitcoin MENA event in Abu Dhabi on Dec. 10. Trump predicted that Bitcoin will eventually reach $1 million per coin, and described the crypto as a “financial paradigm” capable of transforming the global economy. Trump strongly believes in Bitcoin’s role as a store of value and a hedge against inflation, political instability, and natural disasters. Trump drew parallels between Bitcoin adoption and the rise of email, and shared that revolutionary technologies often take time to gain mass acceptance. He also referred to Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins as a unique feature that will drive its value in the long term. Following his latest prediction, Trump has joined other well known advocates like Michael Saylor and Cathie Wood, who both forecasted that BTC could reach the $1 million milestone. Eric Trump at MENA Abu Dhabi (Source: YouTube ) He also stressed the importance of early adoption, and warned that those who fail to embrace Bitcoin and digital currencies risk falling behind. Trump specifically referred to the growing interest in cryptocurrency among major institutions, and shared an anecdote about a friend whose bank, one of the world’s largest, recently launched a crypto desk and committed large resources to the space. Trump finished his speech by celebrating Bitcoin’s recent milestone of surpassing $100,000 for the first time. He also praised the Bitcoin community for their dedication, and reiterated the Trump family’s support for the cryptocurrency. MARA Buys $1.1 Billion in Bitcoin Bitcoin mining giant MARA Holdings Inc. once again expanded its Bitcoin holdings after purchasing 11,774 BTC for $1.1 billion on Dec. 10. The crypto was bought at an average price of $96,000 per Bitcoin, and the purchase was funded through a zero-coupon convertible note offering that was conducted last month. With this acquisition, MARA’s total Bitcoin holdings rose to 40,435 BTC, which is valued at approximately $3.92 billion at the current price. The company reported a 12.3% BTC Yield in the fourth quarter and a 47.6% yield for the year. This reflects the percentage increase in its Bitcoin holdings relative to its fully diluted shares outstanding. MARA implemented a treasury policy since July to retain all Bitcoin it mines while leveraging capital market instruments to boost its reserves even more, very similar to the strategy employed by MicroStrategy. In addition to increasing its Bitcoin holdings, MARA also achieved a major milestone in mining operations. The company’s hashrate doubled in 2024 to reach 50 exahashes per second (EH/s). MARA is the first public Bitcoin miner to achieve this benchmark. Despite these accomplishments, MARA’s stock experienced mixed performance. Shares closed 4.4% lower at $22.81 on Dec. 10 and have seen minimal after-hours recovery. Year-to-date, MARA’s stock is down 0.55%, which is in stark contrast to its remarkable 586% surge during 2023’s market rebound.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6482/microsoft-shareholders-opt-against-bitcoin-investment-proposal,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

Analyst States Timeline,"In a recent tweet, cryptocurrency analyst Egrag Crypto has outlined an ambitious forecast for XRP, building on historical data and Fibonacci retracement levels. By drawing parallels with XRP’s 2017 price cycle, Egrag Crypto presents a detailed projection for the asset’s potential movement through December 2024 and January 2025. Historical Context The analysis begins with a flashback of XRP’s price behavior in 2017. In April 2017, XRP surged 150% during what Egrag named “Candle 2.” This was followed by an extraordinary rally in May 2017, during which XRP experienced a 1,330% increase. By referencing these historical trends, the analyst speculates that a similar pattern could emerge in the current market cycle. #XRP – Bifrost Bridge – January 2025 Candle 13X (UPDATE) What if history repeats itself like the 2017 cycle?

January 2025: Following the pattern of May 2017, XRP may witness a 1,330% rally, potentially propelling its price to the next “Gold Region” of $13.7 to $27.3. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Addressing Market Dynamics Egrag acknowledges the common argument that XRP’s price movements in 2017 occurred in a much smaller market. During that time, the Total Market Cap (TMC) of all cryptocurrencies was around $60 billion, while today it stands at approximately $3.7 trillion—an increase of over 6,000%. Despite the challenges of scaling price movements in larger markets, the analyst maintains optimism. Market Cap and Scaling Analysis Using the 60x growth in TMC as a baseline, Egrag projects the potential market capitalization for XRP : If XRP’s market cap in 2017 was $15 billion, scaling this by the same factor results in a projected cap of $900 billion. For XRP to achieve this, it would need to capture 9% of a $10 trillion market or 18% of a $5 trillion market. These proportions, while ambitious, are framed as achievable in a growing and maturing market. Investor Strategy Egrag also emphasizes the importance of strategy in navigating potential market cycles. Investors are encouraged to consider their plans for holding, selling, reinvesting, or trading profits over the coming months. The choice to either “HODL” or actively participate in trading depends on individual risk tolerance and long-term goals.

In a Dec. 10 X post, Scam Sniffer revealed that fraudsters are creating fake X accounts to impersonate well-known crypto influencers. They then invite users to join Telegram groups under the guise of offering exclusive investment insights. Once inside the Telegram group, users are prompted to verify their identities through “OfficiaISafeguardBot,” a fraudulent verification bot. According to Scam Sniffer, this bot “creates artificial urgency” by imposing short timeframes for verification. How the Scam Works The fake bot injects malicious PowerShell code into victims’ systems, downloading and running malware designed to compromise both computer systems and crypto wallets. Scam Sniffer reported “numerous cases” of this malware being used to steal private keys, enabling the theft of cryptocurrency. The security firm explained that the recent known cases of this scam were all linked to the fake verification bot. “It’s currently unclear if there are other malicious bots. However, it’s obviously simple for them to impersonate others as well,” Scam Sniffer told Cointelegraph. Sophisticated Infrastructure Behind the Scam Scam Sniffer noted that while malware targeting everyday users has existed for a long time, the infrastructure supporting such scams is “developing rapidly” and becoming increasingly “sophisticated.” The firm likened this evolution to a “scam-as-a-service” model, where creators of crypto wallet-draining malware provide their tools to phishing scammers for profit. Although malware distribution via Telegram and impersonation scams are not new, Scam Sniffer stated, “This is the first time we’re seeing this specific combination of fake X accounts, fake Telegram channels, and malicious Telegram bots.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/scammers-use-fake-telegram-bots-to-steal-crypto-wallet-funds/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Between Nov. 2021 and Dec. 2023, Francier Obando Pinillo allegedly operated a Ponzi scheme, falsely claiming to manage a leveraged staking investment in digital assets. Pinillo used his pulpit, social media and businesses to carry out the alleged fraud. He is said to have collected assets from investors, promising to trade them on the now-defunct FTX , according to the complaint. . @CFTC Charges Washington State Pastor with Fraud, Misappropriation in Multilevel Marketing Scheme Targeting Hispanic Americans: https://t.co/duI1GEzwoA — CFTC (@CFTC) December 10, 2024 Pastor Allegedly Promised 34.9% Monthly Returns in “Risk-Free” Crypto Scheme Pinillo, who ran a business under the name Solanofi Entities, allegedly directed customers to transfer digital and fiat assets into wallets and accounts he controlled. He promised up to 34.9% monthly profits, claiming to trade digital assets on the “Solanofi” platform using a proprietary bot he managed which he described as “risk-free.” Moreover, Pinillo allegedly provided customers with an online dashboard to view account statements reflecting their claimed balances. This dashboard allowed them to track their supposed “profits.” The former pastor added a multi-level marketing element to attract more participants. He promised a 15% “referral fee” to customers who recruited friends and family into his scheme. Pastor Allegedly Used Ponzi Scheme to Pay Fake Profits and Referral Fees According to the CFTC, his claims and account statements were fake. During the period in question, no trading platform existed, no trades took place, and no profits were earned. Francier Obando Pinillo allegedly misused all assets entrusted to him. He paid earlier investors fake “profits” and “referral” fees using funds from later investors, operating a classic Ponzi scheme.

Recent data from CryptoQuant has highlighted patterns in accumulation and exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows, providing a detailed look at Ethereum’s potential trajectory as it underperforms relative to Bitcoin in the current cycle. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Faces Pressure: Bulls Tested After Setback Analyzing Trends in Accumulation and ETF Inflows In a series of posts shared on social media platform X, CryptoQuant analysts dissected Ethereum’s key metrics. One of the standout observations was Ethereum’s balance in accumulation addresses. These addresses now hold approximately 19.5 million ETH, valued at around $78 billion. For comparison, Bitcoin accumulation addresses hold about 2.8 million BTC, worth $280 billion. While the dollar value of Bitcoin held is four times larger than Ethereum, this aligns with their relative market capitalizations, offering insights into investor behaviour. Another critical metric spotlighted was the steady inflow into Ethereum-focused ETFs over the past months. Notable spikes were recorded on several key dates, including $1.1 billion on November 11 and $839 million on December 4, 2024. According to the CryptoQuant analysts, these consistent inflows are a strong indicator of institutional buying interest, reinforcing Ethereum’s growing appeal among large-scale investors. The Ethereum ETF has seen steady inflows in recent months. Key spikes on: Nov 11, 2024: $1,100M Nov 21, 2024: $754M Nov 25, 2024: $629M Nov 27, 2024: $883M Dec 4, 2024: $839M These inflows reflect strong buying pressure. pic.twitter.com/OIwWNmRPYB — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) December 10, 2024 Despite the strong ETF demand, Ethereum’s price movements have been less dramatic compared to Bitcoin’s performance in this cycle. Historically, Ethereum’s price peaks have trailed Bitcoin’s, as seen during the 2021 bull run. At that time, Bitcoin hit an all-time high (ATH) in March with a 480% gain, while Ethereum peaked few months after with roughly 1,114% increase. However, in the current cycle, Ethereum appears to be underperforming, signaling a shift in market dynamics. Taker Volume and Potential Growth Furthermore, a significant area of concern the analysts mentioned is the Ethereum’s taker volume, which reflects market sentiment by comparing aggressive buying and selling activity. CryptoQuant reported that Ethereum’s taker-seller volume has hit a record low of -400 million. This aggressive selling activity is reminiscent of patterns observed before its ATH in 2021. While the current selling pressure may seem bearish, it could also signal a market nearing a critical pivot point. Ethereum Taker Volume is at its lowest level on record.

Currently, BabyDoge is trading at $0.00000000539, which is just 16% from its 2022 all-time high (ATH). Will we see a breakout soon? Musk Sparks BabyDoge Mania Elon Musk, the business mogul and meme coin fanatic, sent two tweets this week that helped bolster the BabyDoge price. First, he tweeted an image depicting a doge dog heading a sandstorm that is sweeping across a city. This is likely a reference to his position as co-head of the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E for short) once President-elect Trump takes office. The department aims to cut U.S. government spending but has drawn a lot of buzz among crypto fans because its ticker symbol resembles Dogecoin’s. Unsurprisingly, Musk was unable to resist playing on this. He’s posted countless memes about it since the position was first proposed. pic.twitter.com/eYTt40ahVq — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 7, 2024 Musk then tweeted a second image of him and his son captioned “The Dogefather” and “The Dogeson.” Although Musk didn’t address Baby Doge Coin directly, the resemblance was enough to cause a buying frenzy. pic.twitter.com/DYazX7KMhh — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 7, 2024 Based on its current price of $0.00000000539, BabyDoge is up 23% today, 119% this week, and 105% this month.

And while some traders target new highs, others are now seeking the next project that could provide big gains. Analysts Think These Meme Coins Could Explode Next One of the newest projects getting a lot of attention is Crypto All-Stars . It’s building a meme coin staking platform that lets users stake Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe, Bonk, and more from one app. Users can maximize their staking rewards by holding $STARS, which unifies meme coin fans industry-wide under one token. It’s a concept that could attract huge demand, which analysts say could translate to strong price growth. For instance, ClayBro says it could 10x. He also notes that the project shows huge early demand, which adds to its growth potential. Crypto All-Stars is conducting a presale that has raised over $11 million so far. However, as ClayBro highlights, the presale ends in 10 days, so prospective buyers must act quickly. Flockerz is another promising presale project. It’s creating a new form of governance called “Vote-to-Earn.” This is where all holders of the $FLOCK meme coin get to vote on every decision relating to the project’s future and get paid for it. By placing control in the community’s hands, it ensures decentralization while creating token utility, which could uplift buying pressure. Investors can also stake their $FLOCK tokens for more rewards. Analyst Austin Hilton hailed this as a “great meme coin presale” and urged investors not to miss out. The presale is ongoing and has raised $5.4 million so far. Fartcoin is another meme coin showing huge potential. While it’s not in its presale phase like Crypto All-Stars and Flockerz, it’s in the AI-agent narrative, which is trending and could have much more room for growth. The project uses Andy Ayrey’s Terminal of Truth platform, allowing users to watch an unrestricted conversation between two AI agents unfold in real-time. The idea is to test AI’s boundaries and limitations and find whether it can produce unexpected applications in the crypto space. Indeed, the project’s name instils comedic value, which meme coins are renowned for. This synergy of disruptive technology and memetic humour has made it a fan favourite, with Fartcoin trending on social media this week. Analyst yh_0x noted Fartcoin’s recent strength and suggests it will push toward new highs in the coming weeks. $FARTCOIN one of the strongest recovery of any coin thus far.

The United States has been at the forefront in advocating for a strategic Bitcoin reserve since the re-election of President-elect Donald Trump. Furthermore, top Fed officials believe that Bitcoin is a digital gold with better features including a limited supply of 21 million units. Additionally, the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has proved to be a major success on Wall Street, signaling heightened demand from institutional investors. Alabama State to Lead on Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Plan The state of Alabama could be eyeing to adopt a strategic Bitcoin reserve to ramp up local investment and businesses. According to the state’s auditor Andrew Sorell, the adoption of a Bitcoin plan will shield the people of Alabama from rising inflation and the potential impact of ongoing global de-dollarization. “A well-balanced portfolio should include exposure to many different types of asset classes. As of now, crypto is a $3 trillion asset class that the state has zero exposure to. It is also the most rapidly growing asset class, with the greatest potential for price appreciation. Investing in Treasuries and bonds certainly has its place, but earning a 4% yield while inflation is 2.7% is barely breaking even,” Sorell noted. Market Impact According to Dennis Porter, co-founder of Satoshi Action Fund, the adoption of a strategic Bitcoin reserve will largely escalate the supply vs demand crisis. Furthermore, the supply of Bitcoin on centralized exchanges has dropped to a multi-year low of below 2.26M amid heightened demand from whale investors. With the United States seeking to purchase around 1 million Bitcoin in the next five years under the Trump administration, the overall supply will heavily shrink and result in a super bull cycle.

37323174,https://coinpedia.org/?p=390415,1733895480,Charity Investment Fund (CHIF) Fair Launch Coming Through – Next Big Cryptocurrency Investment of the Year?,"The post Charity Investment Fund (CHIF) Fair Launch Coming Through – Next Big Cryptocurrency Investment of the Year? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Charity Investment Fund (CHIF), a blockchain platform driven by the altruistic desire to help charitable organisations, is poised to launch fairly to the crypto community soon. This blockchain-powered Fund changes the traditional donation paradigm by bridging the gap between investing and donating, allowing investors to become part of something greater. Additionally, with the added element of a fair launch, investors can also benefit from the current bullish economy. What is Charity Investment Fund? The desire to do good lies within everyone. However, not everyone is incentivised to take the right direction. Charity Investment Fund makes it easier by implementing a simple approach: tying the generation of returns to donations. Users can invest in the native digital currency introduced by CHIF. By doing so, they not only create new opportunities to earn gains but also participate in a movement aimed at tackling global challenges. This approach, according to the project’s developers, harnesses the strength of the investment world and directs it toward the path of growth. In essence, the goal of CHIF is to create a circular economy with an altruistic end-game. An influx of investors, incentivised to do good deeds, may come flowing in, and in return, donations will continue to be generated. In theory, this could lead to a perpetual influx of donations, making the world all the better for it. Beneficiaries Of This Unique Donation Ecosystem With charitable initiatives, it is important to have clear goals. It is impractical to focus on all different types of organisations, but one cannot avert their eyes from legitimate causes either. Therefore, Charity Investment Fund has taken an innovative stand to ensure that everyone is taken care of properly. 50% of all the proceeds generated from the ecosystem will be distributed among a selection of charitable foundations. These foundations are yet to be affiliated with this initiative. However, the Charity Investment Fund will not solely decide on selecting the right recipients by itself. Since CHIF is a community-driven initiative, those who participate in this project will benefit. A poll is available on the website to ensure that all donors, as well as investors, have a say in dictating the direction of where the proceeds go. And since transparency is the goal the organisation is striving to achieve, donors will also receive a detailed report of where the funds eventually end up. CHIF Token – The Core Element of Charity Investment Fund Charity Investment Fund is striving to create a sustainable economy with the CHIF token. Described in the whitepaper as a social impact token, it has been developed on the Binance Smart Chain and a wrapped token (wCHIF) is planned to run on an EVM-compatible blockchain. The latter is a custom blockchain designed to facilitate the donation ecosystem. The EVM-compatible chain will also play a major role in expanding Charity Investment Fund’s reach. Additionally, the token is audited, which adds another layer of trust to the organisation. This chain will operate on a Proof of Authority consensus mechanism, reducing transaction costs and enhancing processing speed. Furthermore, the chain will enhance security while reducing energy consumption, making Charity Investment Fund an eco-friendly platform as well. CHIF Fair Launch – Giving All an Equal Chance to Grow CHIF will be made available via a fair launch, an event that will start on December 18th, 2024. The token’s fair launch has been designed as an inclusive event, giving everyone a fair chance to invest in this project. Pinksale has been chosen as the portal for people to participate in this fair launch, and token distribution has already been finalised. 51% of the amount generated through the fair launch will go into the liquidity pool. The remaining 49% will be distributed equally among the Charity Investment Fund initiatives and charities. Beyond Fair Launch – Charity Investment Fund’s 50/50 Model Charity Investment Fund has ensured that it continues to adhere to its altruistic goals beyond the fair launch. So, once the initial launch has concluded, CHIF tokens held by Charity Investment Fund will be split 50/50. That means that for any tokens sold by the Fund afterwards, 50% of the proceeds will go to different charitable organisations. 12 organisations have been nominated so far, they include. 1. World Wildlife Fund (WWF) 2. Ukrainian Red Cross 3. Doctors Without Borders (MSF) in Asia-Pacific 4. World Animal Protection US 5. UNICEF 6. Oxfam International 7. Rainforest Alliance 8. Charity: Water 9. Amnesty International 10. American Cancer Society 11. Oceana 12. IFAW As for the remaining 50% of the tokens held by Charity Investment Fund, they will be used to further develop the project. The end goal is to create a charitable platform with a dedicated wallet for each charity. This wallet will store tokens that are tied to a specific charity, creating a trustless system where donations automatically go to the charitable organisations. With its unique approach to creating a charity ecosystem driven by a new form of economy, the Charity Investment Fund might become a leading cryptocurrency investment in the future. People want to do good, and when there is a project that can nudge them in that direction through profit, it represents a good deal. Furthermore, the broader market dynamics may also push the value of the CHIF token higher, making focusing on the upcoming fair launch a prudent choice.

37491828,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=625747,1733895093,Bitwise makes key crypto predictions for the year 2025,"Bitwise, a crypto exchange-traded funds issuer, expects at least five big crypto companies to go public with their shares next year. These include Circle, an issuer of stablecoins, and Kraken, an established crypto exchange. The predictions were made in a recent report by Matt Hougan and Ryan Rasmussen at Bitwise titled ‘10 Crypto Predictions for 2025’. They mentioned the possibility that “crypto bank” Anchorage Digital, analytics firm Chainalysis, and crypto exchange Figure will go public. According to them, rising investor interest, more involvement from major financial players, good economic conditions, and more friendly political attitudes will all contribute to making 2025 the “Year of the Crypto IPO”. Circle, Figure, Kraken, Anchorage Digital, and Chainalysis were the five likely candidates for a 2025 IPO. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana to reach new records, according to Bitwise Another prediction included in the report was for BTC to cross $200,000 by the end of next year. The figure would grow to $500,000 if the U.S. government followed through on proposals for a $1 million Bitcoin strategic reserve. A bonus prediction mentioned BTC surpassing gold’s market cap of $18 trillion in 2029. On the other hand, Ethereum would also hit a record high of $7,000, pushed by increasing activity on Ethereum’s layer two networks, including a “massive growth in stablecoins and tokenized projects” and more cash inflows into Ether exchange-traded funds. Hougan and Rasmussen expect Solana’s association with “serious” projects to increase its price to $750, a 250% rise from its current price of $215. “ We’ve already seen early examples with projects like Render making the leap. We expect that to accelerate in the year ahead.” -Matt Hougan and Ryan Rasmussen The duo referred to Solana as the crypto phoenix, which rose from the ashes of the 2022 market crash and climbed to ‘new heights’ in 2024, fueled by the memecoin mania that eclipsed the GameStop saga. Hougan and Rasmussen predicted that the rise of the three tokens would be catalyzed by institutional investments, wirehouse approvals, layer 2 scaling, the U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve, upsized allocations, macro windfall, and better regulatory/ political climate. They also highlighted the potential headwinds as disappointment from Washington D.C., the failure of memecoin mania, leverage blowout, disappointing rate cuts, and selling by governments. Bitcoin ETFs to record more flows in 2025 The Hougan and Rasmussen report predicted that U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF inflows in 2025 would surpass the record-setting $33.6 billion gathered in 2024 since they were launched. The prediction was based on the fact that Bitcoin ETFs had passed the higher end of the range ($5B —$15B) projected by ETF experts within the first six months. Based on inflows in the first year, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs smashed the 25-year-old record for the most successful ETF launch of all time. Hougan and Rasmussen believe that the trillions of dollars managed by Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, and Wells Fargo will start flowing into Bitcoin ETFs in 2025. They also suspected that most investors who bought Bitcoin ETFs in 2024 would double down in 2025 based on the 7-year pattern of building on small allocations witnessed at Bitwise. The report suggested that the number of countries currently holding Bitcoin reserves would also double in 2025. Nine countries held Bitcoin reserves, led by the U.S. with over 198K BTC and China’s 190K BTC. The UK, Ukraine, and Bhutan held ~61.2K BTC, ~46.3K BTC, and ~$11.7K BTC, respectively, while El Salvador and Venezuela had Bitcoin reserves of ~5.4K BTC and 240 BTC, respectively. Finland and Georgia had less than 100 BTC each. While Hougan and Rasmussen were unsure whether the U.S. would establish a Bitcoin reserve in 2025, they believed it was possible. They further predicted that the U.S. actively considering building a strategic Bitcoin reserve would trigger a global arms race for governments to stockpile Bitcoin.

37491693,https://coinpaper.com/6483/ripple-gains-regulatory-nod-for-rlusd-stablecoin,1733895023,Ripple Gains Regulatory Nod for RLUSD Stablecoin,"Ripple Labs and Tether, two prominent names in the cryptocurrency sector, have secured significant regulatory milestones this week. Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin received approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), while Tether’s USDT was recognized as an Accepted Virtual Asset (AVA) by the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM). Ripple Secures NYDFS Approval for RLUSD Stablecoin, Aims to Revolutionize Institutional Payments Ripple Labs has achieved a significant milestone with the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) approving its RLUSD stablecoin. Announced by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse in a Dec. 10 X post, the approval marks a pivotal step for Ripple's expansion into the competitive stablecoin market. The RLUSD stablecoin, first unveiled in April 2024, is positioned as a competitor to Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC. These two market leaders currently boast a combined market capitalization of $180 billion. Ripple has ambitious plans for RLUSD, projecting that the stablecoin could reach a staggering $2 trillion market capitalization by 2028. Ripple's foray into the stablecoin sector began with RLUSD’s testing on the XRP Ledger and Ethereum mainnets in August. By October, the company announced partnerships with several high-profile exchanges, including Uphold, Bitstamp, Bitso, MoonPay, Independent Reserve, CoinMENA, and Bullish. These collaborations were instrumental in preparing RLUSD for its eventual launch and adoption. Garlinghouse has hinted that announcements on exchange and partner listings for RLUSD are imminent, setting the stage for Ripple to compete directly with existing stablecoins. With the NYDFS approval, Ripple has cleared a regulatory hurdle that solidifies its credibility in the eyes of institutional players—a key target demographic for RLUSD. RLUSD, like other USD-backed stablecoins, will maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar. Ripple has outlined a robust reserve strategy, including USD deposits, short-term US Treasury bonds, and other cash equivalents, to ensure stability. This approach aligns with the increasing regulatory scrutiny faced by stablecoin issuers. Monica Long, Ripple’s president, described RLUSD in June as “complementary and additive” to Ripple’s flagship XRP token. This dual offering positions Ripple to cater to both retail and institutional audiences, leveraging XRP’s established network while RLUSD addresses the growing demand for stable, dollar-backed digital assets. Ripple’s stablecoin strategy emphasizes institutional adoption. Garlinghouse highlighted this focus in September, outlining plans to tailor RLUSD to financial institutions seeking efficient, transparent, and secure payment solutions. By addressing this niche, Ripple aims to carve out a substantial market share in the burgeoning stablecoin sector. Ripple’s entry into the stablecoin market comes amidst its ongoing legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over XRP token offerings. Despite the legal challenges, Ripple continues to advocate for the broader cryptocurrency industry, with Garlinghouse recently appearing on CBS’s 60 Minutes to discuss the sector’s potential impact on the 2024 US presidential election. Ripple’s Competitive Edge What sets Ripple apart is its established reputation and robust infrastructure. The company’s XRP Ledger is known for its speed, scalability, and low transaction costs. By integrating RLUSD into this ecosystem, Ripple offers an end-to-end solution for cross-border payments and financial transactions. Furthermore, Ripple’s partnerships with global exchanges and financial institutions enhance RLUSD’s accessibility and usability. This network effect could play a crucial role in RLUSD achieving its ambitious market capitalization target. Ripple’s approval from the NYDFS is a critical step, but the journey is far from over. The company now faces the challenge of scaling RLUSD and gaining traction in a market dominated by USDT and USDC. However, Ripple’s innovative approach, combined with its focus on institutional adoption, positions it well for success. As the cryptocurrency industry evolves, stablecoins like RLUSD are poised to play an increasingly vital role in bridging traditional finance and blockchain technology. Tether’s USDt Stablecoin Gains Regulatory Recognition in Abu Dhabi Global Market While Ripple tries to gain traction in the stablecoin market, Tether continues to expand its lead. The Abu Dhabi Global Market’s (ADGM) Financial Services Regulatory Authority has officially recognized Tether’s USDt (USDT) stablecoin as an Accepted Virtual Asset (AVA). This development not only solidifies USDT’s status as the largest stablecoin by market capitalization but is also evidence of the United Arab Emirates’ commitment to becoming a global leader in digital finance. The recognition allows licensed financial service providers within the ADGM to offer services related to USDT, marking a significant milestone in the stablecoin’s journey. Covering USDT issued on multiple blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche, the decision aligns with the UAE’s broader strategy of fostering innovation and embracing digital finance. With a market capitalization exceeding $138 billion, Tether’s USDT continues to dominate the stablecoin market, holding approximately 70% of the sector’s total value. This endorsement by the ADGM further reinforces USDT’s role as a critical bridge between traditional finance and the burgeoning world of digital assets. The ADGM’s decision to integrate USDT into its regulatory framework is a strong indication of its ambition to position Abu Dhabi as a hub for financial innovation. By welcoming stablecoins into its ecosystem, the ADGM is not only supporting economic diversification within the UAE but also laying the groundwork for a future where digital and traditional financial systems coexist seamlessly. The move follows a global trend where regulatory bodies recognize the potential of stablecoins to enhance financial inclusivity and efficiency. However, it also comes with challenges as regulators grapple with ensuring robust risk management and stability in this fast-evolving space. The ADGM’s forward-looking stance contrasts with more cautious views from regulatory bodies such as the United States Financial Services Oversight Council (FSOC). The FSOC has consistently flagged concerns about the concentration of market power in the stablecoin sector, with Tether being the dominant player. The council’s warnings shed some light on potential risks, including systemic vulnerabilities and exposure to bank runs. In its most recent report, the FSOC emphasized the need for stronger risk management standards to mitigate these risks as stablecoins continue to gain traction in traditional financial systems. Tether’s recent activity has further cemented its position as a major player in the cryptocurrency market. In November, the company injected over $5 billion into the market within 72 hours, fueling discussions about its influence on market dynamics. This rapid expansion coincided with Bitcoin’s surge to a record high of $76,200, highlighting the intertwined nature of stablecoin activity and broader market movements. The minting spree propelled USDT’s market capitalization from $124 billion in early November to $138 billion by Dec. 10, a growth trajectory that coincided with the ADGM approval. Balancing Opportunity and Risk While the recognition of USDT as an AVA in the ADGM is a positive development for Tether and the broader stablecoin sector, it also brings regulatory challenges to the forefront. Stablecoins offer unparalleled opportunities for financial innovation, but their integration into traditional systems must be carefully managed to ensure stability and transparency. The ADGM’s decision is a step toward achieving this balance, setting a precedent for other jurisdictions to follow. By providing a regulated framework for stablecoins, the ADGM is fostering trust and encouraging broader adoption of digital assets in mainstream financial systems. As the global stablecoin market continues to grow, regulatory acceptance like that from the ADGM will play a pivotal role in shaping the future of digital finance. For Tether, this recognition is not just a validation of USDT’s utility but also an opportunity to expand its presence in the Middle East, a region increasingly seen as a hub for cryptocurrency innovation. With its dominant market position and ongoing efforts to integrate into regulated ecosystems, Tether is poised to remain a cornerstone of the stablecoin sector. The UAE’s proactive approach, exemplified by the ADGM’s decision, sets a strong example for other nations exploring the potential of stablecoins as a tool for financial inclusion and economic growth.",POSITIVE,USDT | XRP,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | USDT | XRP,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6483/ripple-gains-regulatory-nod-for-rlusd-stablecoin,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png
37493229,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51836,1733895020,"XRP Resistance Mounts, Causing Investors To Diversify With Floki And Rollblock","As XRP faces mounting resistance, investors are looking for altcoins with the most potential in the market. Many investors are now shifting attention to emerging tokens like Floki and Rollblock. Both tokens are gaining traction for their growth potential, but experts highlight Rollblock as the best crypto to invest in. Here’s why $RBLK could outperform major tokens like XRP or Floki going into 2025. Ripple Breaks Past $2 Amid Crypto Market Bull Run Ripple saw major returns in the wake of Donald Trump’s election. XRP surged 84% to $0.92 on November 15 from $0.50 at the beginning of the month. XRP rallied by an additional 112% to $1.95 on November 30. The upward momentum grew stronger in December as XRP increased by 35.38% to cross the $2 mark and reach $2.64 within the first 8 days. However, despite this remarkable performance, analysts are modest with their prediction for the future, with many forecasting an XRP price resistance in December. Floki Surges 115% in November Another token that delivered impressive gains following the result of the U.S. election is Floki. Floki ‘s price experienced a 115.38% rise from $0.00013 on November 1 to $0.00028 on November 15, only to unexpectedly drop 17.86% to $0.00023 by November 30. However, this changed in December as the price recovered 13.04% in just 8 days to $0.00026. Despite this recovery, many investors are now more cautious about Floki’s future growth. Rollblock Eclipse Ripple and Floki to Become the Best Crypto To Invest in Today Rollblock is an innovative GambleFi protocol that has attracted over 20,000 players and supports over 20 major cryptocurrencies. The platform combines the strengths of decentralized and centralized systems and contains over 7,000 games from poker to blackjack and new Web3 opportunities. Users can enjoy these games anytime from anywhere without additional downloads or installation. Rollblock is fully regulated and licensed, allowing users to explore without breaking the law. Rollblock uses the Ethereum blockchain to back every transaction or bet on the platform. This means that users cannot tamper with records as they’re permanent and unchangeable, making the gaming experience fair and transparent. For users seeking passive income opportunities, Rollblock offers a revenue share model. As part of this model, Rollblock uses up to 30% of its revenue to buy $RBLK tokens from the open market. 40% of these tokens are used to reward stakers and the remaining 60% of tokens are burned. This makes $RBLK deflationary, increasing its value over time. Currently in its ninth presale stage and priced at $0.041, $RBLK offers early investors the opportunity to earn significant market returns. Unlike XRP and Floki, experts predict a 5X increase before the new year and up to 100X after launch. Don’t miss the opportunity to secure maximum returns before the token price takes off!

Crying Kamala (CRYKAMA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because CRYKAMA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Crying Kamala can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crying Kamala could become the next viral memecoin. Crying Kamala launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Crying Kamala on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Crying Kamala by entering its contract address – 5eCJhSGBUN4YwJHLU9ZcWjrjmoufVznjzNBHfo4TN1P7 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CRYKAMA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/crying-kamala-crykama-solana-memecoin-will-surge-17000-before-exchange-listings-while-bonk-shib-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

John E. Deaton following his interview on 60 Minutes highlighted Garlinghouse’s resilience during Ripple’s ongoing battle with the SEC and its recent stablecoin launch, making a case for him as “Crypto CEO of the Year.” With Ripple sailing rough waters and still expanding, 2025 could be the company’s most transformative year yet. https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1866676037049782422 A Tough Fight with the SEC Ripple has been fighting a long legal battle with the SEC, and many, including crypto expert John E. Deaton, believe the company could win. Deaton points to the support of key commissioners like Hester Peirce, Mark Uyeda, and Paul Atkins who think the SEC’s appeal should be dismissed. If the appeal is dropped by voting, Ripple could finally get the clarity it needs to operate more freely in the U.S. market. This would be a big win for Ripple and could open up new opportunities for growth in the U.S., a crucial market for the company. Positioning for a Regulatory Breakthrough Deaton predicts 2025 could be Ripple’s defining year, especially if the SEC’s appeal is dismissed, a move even critics like John Reed Stark support. With a pro-crypto administration and bipartisan regulatory clarity on the horizon, Ripple’s U.S. market expansion appears promising. Deaton highlighted the company’s resilience, achieving 95% of its business outside the U.S. during regulatory hurdles. In January 2024, Ripple’s bold $285 million share buyback at an $11 billion valuation showcased confidence, despite legal uncertainties. With $1 billion in cash and 40 billion XRP held in escrow, Deaton speculates Ripple’s valuation could exceed $100 billion. A dismissed appeal might pave the way for Ripple’s IPO by late 2025 or early 2026. Moreover, with Trump’s win, many predict that the Ripple vs SEC case will be dismissed by the new SEC commissioner. RLUSD’s launch before the finale of the Ripple vs SEC lawsuit in January hints that Ripple is very sure that the case will not drag further. However, the news has not given a positive boost to XRP as predicted and it dropped by 12% to $2.07. While the entire crypto market is down in the holiday season it will be interesting to see how and when XRP touches its coveted target of $3. Is XRP a Good Investment ? XRP could be a good investment given Ripple’s strong leadership, solid financials, and potential regulatory clarity in 2025, which may boost growth. However, ongoing SEC challenges and market volatility present risks to consider. How high can XRP go? XRP can reach a high of $3 or more if Ripple secures a favorable outcome in its legal battle with the SEC and gains regulatory clarity in the U.S. This, combined with Ripple’s strong financial position and potential IPO, could drive its growth.",POSITIVE,XRP,ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/ripple-predictions-2025-a-green-light-for-ipo-and-100b-valuation-amid-sec-case-dismissal/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

This approval allows Ripple to launch RLUSD publicly, positioning it as a key player in New York’s regulated digital finance market and expanding its role in the global stablecoin ecosystem. XRP last rose 8.3% to $2.33, and is up 70% in the last two weeks. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced the approval in an X post late Tuesday, adding that Ripple will officially announce RLUSD’s launch once it becomes available on exchanges. This just in…we have final approval from @NYDFS for $RLUSD ! Exchange and partner listings will be live soon – and reminder: when RLUSD is live, you’ll hear it from @Ripple first. — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) December 10, 2024 Ripple’s RLUSD Approval Marks Strategic Shift Toward Regulated Stablecoin Market Ripple had initially set its sights on a potential launch date of Dec. 4, but the company did not receive the final approval in time. RLUSD marks a strategic shift to offer customers a stable, regulated digital asset, reducing exposure to XRP’s volatility and regulatory challenges. This approval puts Ripple in direct competition with U.S. stablecoin leaders like Circle, Paxos, and Gemini, operating under New York’s strict regulations. The NYDFS, known for its high standards, enforces strict rules on transparency, security and consumer protection. Ripple designed RLUSD to maintain a 1:1 peg to the US dollar. The stablecoin operates on the XRP Ledger and Ethereum blockchains, ensuring compatibility with existing financial systems and improving digital transaction efficiency. By offering RLUSD alongside XRP, Ripple aims to strengthen its remittance and settlement services. RLUSD Could Boost XRP’s Utility, Liquidity and Price Growth: Analyst Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, said that Ripple’s introduction of RLUSD could significantly enhance XRP’s utility and liquidity. “By increasing transaction volumes and demand for XRP, RLUSD may play a pivotal role in supporting price growth. Additionally, Ripple’s ongoing adoption for cross-border payments continues to bolster market sentiment,” he said. “Looking ahead to 2025, XRP’s price projections range broadly, with an average forecast between $1.8 and $8.4, and some optimistic scenarios suggesting peaks above $10. This outlook hinges on increased adoption and a resolution to regulatory hurdles. RLUSD’s adoption as a key transaction tool could further solidify XRP’s role in the financial ecosystem.” “That said, broader crypto market trends, particularly Bitcoin’s performance, remain significant factors influencing XRP’s price trajectory.” The post XRP Climbs 8% Following NYDFS Approval for Ripple’s RLUSD Stablecoin appeared first on Cryptonews .",POSITIVE,XRP,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/ripple-xrp-nydfs-approval-rlusd-stablecoin/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/37497196.jpeg

The price is now trading below $230 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $220 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if the bulls clear the $220 zone. Solana Price Eyes Upside Break Solana price formed a support base and started a fresh increase from the $204 level like Bitcoin and Ethereum . There was a decent increase above the $210 and $212 resistance levels. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $243 swing high to the $203 low. However, the price is now facing many hurdles near $220. Solana is now trading above $218 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $220 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $220 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. The next major resistance is near the $224 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $243 swing high to the $203 low. The main resistance could be $228. A successful close above the $228 resistance level could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $235. Any more gains might send the price toward the $250 level. Another Decline in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $220 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $212 level. The first major support is near the $205 level. A break below the $205 level might send the price toward the $200 zone.

Fast forward to the Web3 era, and BitMEX CEO Stephan Lutz, who was appointed to the role in late 2022, says he's fine with competitors copying the crypto exchange's invention of the perpetual swap, the financial instrument that underpins the crypto derivatives market. The more traders access the tool, the healthier the market, the logic goes.  “It was copied by everyone, because that’s just open-source know-how,"" Lutz said in an interview with CoinDesk. The whole world works on it, which is like the best form of flattery we can wish for in the end.”  Unlike futures — which are contracts to buy or sell an asset at a specific price on a specific date — the perpetual swap eliminates expiration and mirrors the feel of margin trading. Perpetuals act as a rolling series of short-term futures contracts using a funding rate, or payment exchanged between long and short positions, to maintain price alignment with the underlying asset.  Lutz argues that the perpetual swap was a cornerstone innovation in crypto trading because it addressed a fundamental challenge in building derivatives in the early crypto market structure.  ""You faced counterparty credit risk, and there was no real structure for bringing longs and shorts together,” he said. ""The perpetual swap with the funding mechanism and the insurance fund in the background sparked the whole [futures] trading industry.""  It also allows traders to react with the hyperdrive speed required in crypto.  ""If you say it's a seven-year cycle [some investors believe the market functions in this pattern] in TradFi, this cycle is six months in crypto,"" Lutz, a veteran of Deutsche Börse, which operates the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, said. ""You need to react to new developments very quickly.""  While BitMEX is nowhere near the largest derivatives exchange by volume anymore – that's what happens when larger centralized exchanges, like Binance, adopt the perp and get into the derivatives business – it still has a loyal cadre of traders.  One reason for that is because BitMEX does not have its own market-making desk. It doesn't trade against its own customers, Lutz said.  ""Our funding rates can sometimes differ because we ensure completely independent price discovery, which is important for maintaining fairness,"" he said. ""It's a matter of neutrality.""  During periods of high volatility, particularly market downturns, BitMEX often sees its market share spike — sometimes double — Lutz explains because of the exchange's loyal cadre of derivatives traders.  Another 10 years  Sometimes it's tough to imagine where a crypto company will be in 10 years, given the speed at which the industry operates.  Compare the liquidation and winding up of Lehman Brothers, to the relatively rapid resolution of FTX's bankruptcy.  As for BitMEX, Lutz foresees the exchange maintaining its niche in bitcoin-based derivatives while selectively expanding its offerings.  And maybe sometime during this next decade, BitMEX will invent something new — and be flattered when the entire industry copies it.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/11/as-bit-mex-turns-10-the-market-is-still-thankful-for-the-perpetual-swap,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d3782418ba4a68c4d6826b22578bb1c776c50374-3001x2000.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Cryptocurrency Derivatives Market Has Just Seen Massive Long Liquidations According to data from CoinGlass, a mass amount of liquidations have piled up over on the derivatives side of the cryptocurrency sector during the last 24 hours. “Liquidation” here refers to the forceful closure that any open contract undergoes when its bet fails enough to accumulate losses equal to a certain degree (the exact value of which may differ between platforms). Related Reading: Bitcoin HODLing Rewards: Long-Term Holders Selling At 326% Profit Below is a table that breaks down the relevant numbers related to the liquidations from the past day. As is visible, there have been total liquidations of cryptocurrency-related contracts worth a whopping $1.56 billion in the past day. The long holders were involved in an overwhelming majority of this flush, with liquidations associated with them standing at $1.39 billion (almost 90% of the total). The reason behind the large liquidations is the crash that the altcoin market has faced during this window, with many popular coins like XRP and Dogecoin being down double digits. It would appear that many traders had set up bullish positions on the market, hoping that the recent momentum led by Bitcoin’s exploration to new highs would continue shortly. BTC has interestingly managed to limit its losses to just 2%, but evidently, the rest of the market hasn’t been so lucky. As for which of the assets was responsible for the most liquidations, the below heatmap shows it. Usually, Bitcoin leads the market liquidations, but it appears the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum has instead contributed the most towards the flush with $229 million in positions. Dogecoin and XRP have followed BTC’s $173 million liquidations with flushes of $88 million and $68 million, respectively. Their large liquidations are likely due to their popularity and the notable scale of drawdown they have seen. It would also seem that the speculative interest in the sector has been so deep recently that the small cap assets (referred to as ‘others’ in the heatmap) have added up to a massive $496 million liquidation. Related Reading: Analyst Sets $4.40 XRP Target As 3rd-Straight Bull Pennant Forms Mass liquidation events aren’t particularly rare in the cryptocurrency sector, but today’s flush has been extraordinary even for the market’s standards. These events happen from time to time because coins across the board generally display notable volatility, and a lot of speculators opt for risky amounts of leverage. These two conditions have been particularly pronounced recently, which is why the derivatives sector has exploded in this fashion. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is trading around $2.09, down almost 15% in the last seven days.

The request comes amid the growing demand for AI technologies in various industries worldwide. Reuters reported the information on December 11th. According to the news outlet, someone involved in the matter said the search engine giant’s request followed the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s outreach to Google regarding Microsoft’s business methods as part of a broader investigation. The story explained that other big cloud providers, such as Google and Amazon, also want to tap into the market and host OpenAI’s models. If the FTC approves Google’s requests, customers of those companies can use OpenAI’s tools without having to go through Microsoft’s servers. Google highlights that added costs can burden OpenAI customers The tech giant added that companies using OpenAI’s ChatGPT through Microsoft could face additional fees if they don’t already run on Microsoft’s servers. Other rivals of Microsoft say that these added costs will ultimately hurt the customers and therefore restrict technological access. Reuters asked Microsoft, OpenAI, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, and the search engine giant for comment but did not get an immediate reply. In June of this year, U.S. regulators, including the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department, launched antitrust investigations on Microsoft, OpenAI, and Nvidia over their influence in using artificial intelligence. In January, FTC Chair Lina Khan announced the investigations on the investments and partnerships being formed between AI developers and major cloud service providers while speaking at the agency’s tech summit on AI. Elon Musk expands his lawsuit against OpenAI to include antitrust claims Elon Musk expands his lawsuit against OpenAI to include Microsoft, alleging antitrust claims over attempts to monopolize the generative AI market. #AI #Antitrust #Microsoft #OpenAI — Ox HaK (@oxhak) November 15, 2024 In mid-November, billionaire tech entrepreneur Elon Musk expanded his existing lawsuit against the ChatGPT developer, reinforcing the case with fresh claims, including antitrust allegations. According to the lawsuit filed in the federal court in Oakland, California, Musk explained that OpenAI and Microsoft illegally colluded to monopolize the market for generative artificial intelligence and sideline competitors. OpenAI said in a statement that the updated lawsuit is even more baseless and overreaching than the initial filing. Musk first filed the lawsuit against OpenAI and its co-founders, Sam Altman and Greg Brockman, on August 5th. In the lawsuit, he alleged that the accused manipulated him to help develop the AI company and that OpenAI violated the founding consensus to develop AI for the well-being of humanity. The complaint also highlighted that OpenAI went from a tax-exempt non-profit to a $157 billion “market-paralyzing gorgon” in eight years. Musk wants the U.S. regulators to revoke OpenAI’s license as a for-profit company with Microsoft and mandate the two entities to divest the illicit gains achieved after the transition. As the legal disputes ensue, sources also recently revealed that OpenAI seeks to ditch Microsoft after achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). AGI is a highly autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable work. According to the sources, the provision will exclude Microsoft from the startup’s most advanced AI models once AGI is achieved. The sources also revealed that OpenAI’s board of directors will determine when AGI is achieved. The matter is still under discussion, and the board has not yet finalized the way forward.

Yesterday’s price movement created some uncertainty in the market. While a rebound was seen at $0.93, it wasn’t strong enough for a major V-shaped rally. The market could see another low, in line with Bitcoin’s current movement. Today, ADA is showing further downside, although the previous day’s low has yet to be broken. Potential for a Reversal The next low may be the final one, but confirming that a low has been reached is difficult without a break in resistance . Currently, the price seems to be experiencing a corrective bounce, possibly the fifth wave down. If ADA breaks below $0.83, this would hint at a continued larger fourth wave. Bullish Divergence Possibility There is potential for bullish divergence if ADA reaches oversold conditions on the 4-hour chart. If a new low forms but the RSI remains above 20.8-20.9, it could signal a bullish divergence and set the stage for a reversal. However, this is not guaranteed, and the market will need to show specific price action to confirm this. Curious about Cardano’s future? Check out our Cardano price prediction for expert insights and stay ahead in the market! Key Price Levels to Watch A break above the $1 level could signal the end of the downtrend and the start of a new wave. If ADA moves past $1.67, it would indicate that a significant low has been formed, whether it happens now or after another low. Overall Market Sentiment In the broader altcoin market, ADA is following Bitcoin’s movement, with altcoins showing heightened volatility. Despite Bitcoin being down around 1%, ADA is still holding above critical support levels at $0.83, which is important for the current setup. Additionally, holding above $0.64 is crucial for maintaining the overall uptrend that began in November. FAQs How does Bitcoin’s movement affect Cardano’s price? ADA closely follows Bitcoin’s trends, with Bitcoin’s volatility influencing ADA’s market sentiment and price action. Can Cardano’s price rebound soon?

But the rally has faced significant resistance as investors turned to caution. As a result, Toncoin has witnessed a sharp decline in wallet profitability, with only 65% of addresses now in profit – a stark drop from the 90% peak recorded just a week ago. The latest IntoTheBlock data indicates that 25% of Toncoin wallets are currently at a loss, while 11% remain at breakeven. This shift highlights the recent turbulence in Toncoin’s market price, affecting profitability for many holders. Ownership trends revealed that the majority of Toncoin holders – 85% – have held the coin for less than a year, with 12% acquiring it within the past month. Long-term holders, those holding the asset for over a year, account for only 3%, suggesting the dominance of short-term traders in the Toncoin ecosystem. Meanwhile, trading activity also depicted an interesting geographic pattern, with 61% of Toncoin transactions occurring during Western trading hours, leaving 39% during Eastern hours. Over the past week, the network saw over $51.97 billion worth of high-value transactions exceeding $100K. Despite this strong activity, Toncoin’s price has dipped 8.41% over the past 24 hours, now trading at $5.93. The cryptocurrency’s market capitalization currently stands at $15.12 billion. Meanwhile, trading volume surged 142%, reaching $779.6 million, pointing to sustained market interest despite the challenges posed by recent fluctuations. Besides, CryptoQuant analysts suggest that the cryptocurrency could see a meaningful rally and even reclaim its previously established peak based on ” strong fundamentals, including an active development team and an active network.” The post Toncoin (TON) Wallet Profitability Dips as Market Volatility Increases appeared first on CryptoPotato .",NEGATIVE,TON,BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | TON,,0,0,Crypto Potato,https://cryptopotato.com/toncoin-ton-wallet-profitability-dips-as-market-volatility-increases/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/37490066.jpeg

37489618,https://coinpedia.org/?p=391596,1733890526,XRP News Today: Ripple’s RLUSD Stablecoin Gets NYDFS Approval,"The post XRP News Today: Ripple’s RLUSD Stablecoin Gets NYDFS Approval appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ripple News Today: After months of speculation, Ripple’s U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, RLUSD, has received final regulatory approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) . This milestone marks a major achievement for Ripple. The announcement, shared by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse on X, sparked a 10% surge in XRP, Ripple’s native token. The approval paves the way for RLUSD to go live on exchanges and partner platforms, signaling Ripple’s expansion into the stablecoin market. RLUSD: Ripple’s Big Bet on Stablecoins RLUSD is currently in beta testing on the Ethereum network and XRP Ledger (XRPL), with a circulating supply of $52 million. This stablecoin is pegged to short-term U.S. government bonds and aims to tap into the rapidly growing stablecoin market, which is currently dominated by Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC). Ripple’s entry into this market is part of its strategy to become a leader in institutional payments and real-world asset tokenization. Stablecoins Current Market Position The stablecoin market, valued at nearly $200 billion, is expected to grow exponentially in the coming years. Ripple plans to leverage RLUSD to expand its role in global payments while providing a bridge for traditional financial assets to operate on blockchain networks. Tokenization, the process of converting physical assets into digital tokens for faster and more efficient transactions, is a key focus for Ripple. RLUSD is positioned as a major player in this trend. Will it Send XRP Price to ATH? Vincent Van Code, a crypto expert broke down the buzz around Ripple’s RLUSD and XRP in simple terms. He pointed out that while XRP’s recent jump from $1.90 to $2.35 is exciting, it’s mostly driven by speculation, not real-world usage just yet. The real game-changer will come when Ripple sets up automated market makers (AMMs) and liquidity pools (LPs), offering up to 5% annual returns on-chain without any counterparty risk. He explained how this could attract serious funds to the XRPL, with exchanges getting in on the action by offering RLUSD staking. This would lock up more XRP, driving up demand. Plus, users may start swapping USDT for RLUSD and move these funds to their self-custody wallets. From there, they can use RLUSD to buy XRP or invest in LP tokens to earn even better returns—creating a feedback loop that raises XRP demand even further. In short, this isn’t just about today’s price pump; it’s about setting the stage for sustained growth. Van Code predicts RLUSD could double XRP demand and potentially shake up the market by February 2025. However the present scenario is quite alarming, the crypto market is taking a big hit, with XRP dropping 12% to $2.07. This sharp fall reflects a tough day for many cryptocurrencies, as prices tumble across the board. Despite recent good news for Ripple, like its stablecoin approval, the market’s volatility shows no signs of slowing down. When Will RLUSD Launch ? The RLUSD stablecoin by Ripple is expected to launch by the end of 2024 , following its recent regulatory approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) . Is the Federal Reserve Going to Use XRP? The Federal Reserve has not officially adopted XRP, but Ripple’s involvement in the FedNow real-time payment system has fueled speculation about its future role​",POSITIVE,USDT | XRP,FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | USDT | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-news-today-ripples-rlusd-stablecoin-gets-nydfs-approval/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

With BTC trading near $97,500, this strategic move has sparked analysis and debate among traders regarding its potential impact on market trends and sentiment. Bhutan Offloads $40 Million in Bitcoin Over the past two months, the Royal Government of Bhutan has sold 1,696 BTC , valued at approximately $139 million, at an average price of $81,999 per coin. The latest transaction, reported by Arkham Intelligence, involved 406 BTC worth $40 million transferred to QCP Capital. This marks Bhutan’s strategic move to capitalize on Bitcoin’s recent price rally. BREAKING : Royal Government of #Bhutan has just transferred 406 BTC ($40M). They still hold 12,202 BTC worth $1.2B. pic.twitter.com/5gP4PNOLGa — Whale Alerts (@WhaleAlerts_08) December 9, 2024 Despite these sales, Bhutan remains a major BTC holder, with a treasury balance of 11,791 BTC valued at $1.16 billion. Known for leveraging hydroelectric energy for mining, Bhutan has built a significant portion of its Bitcoin reserves through sustainable operations. This continued holding positions Bhutan as the fourth-largest government holder of Bitcoin globally. Why Bhutan’s Moves Matter Market Impact : Bhutan’s periodic sales highlight a calculated effort to capitalize on Bitcoin’s price peaks while maintaining its long-term holdings. Mining Strategy : Bhutan’s hydro-powered mining operations showcase a model of sustainable BTC accumulation, differentiating it from speculative buyers. Investor Sentiment : While some fear these sales could pressure BTC prices, analysts remain bullish on Bitcoin’s trajectory, particularly for 2025. Bitcoin Holds $97,500: Bulls Eye $98,000 While $96,000 Supports the Base Bitcoin is trading at $97,487, marginally recovering from a 1.32% decline over 24 hours. On the 4-hour chart, BTC stays above its ascending trendline, with $96,000 serving as a pivotal support level. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 46.92, reflecting neutral momentum with a slight bearish tilt. Key Levels to Watch : Immediate Resistance : $98,003, with further targets at $100,418 and $103,617. Support Zones : $96,000, followed by $95,490 and $92,194. EMA Indicators : The 50-day Exponential Moving Average at $98,310 currently limits upward movement. If BTC breaks above $98,003, it could reignite bullish sentiment, targeting $100,418. However, a sustained drop below $96,000 may push prices toward $92,194, intensifying bearish momentum. Conclusion As Bitcoin stabilizes near $97,500, its trajectory hinges on key levels, including the $96,000 support and $98,003 resistance. Bhutan’s strategic Bitcoin sales underscore the complex dynamics influencing BTC prices. – You might also like Bitcoin Price Prediction 2024 – 2034 The post Bitcoin Struggles as Bhutan Sells BTC Holdings – Could $96K Be at Risk? appeared first on Cryptonews .",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING | ARKM,,0,0,cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-struggles-as-bhutan-sells-btc-holdings-could-96k-be-at-risk/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/37497195.jpeg

37497194,https://cryptonews.com/?p=318555,1733890119,"Hedge Fund Titan Ray Dalio Favors Gold, Bitcoin Over Debt Investments","Prominent American investor and hedge fund manager Ray Dalio is once more promoting investment in gold and Bitcoin, deliberately avoiding debt assets since major economies are dealing with rapidly increasing indebtedness. The South China Morning Post reported Dalio’s remarks from a financial conference in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday. There, he said he believes there will likely be a “pending debt money problem,” and that he wants to “steer away from debt assets like bonds and debt, and have some hard money like gold and Bitcoin.” Bitcoin, often called “digital gold,” shares gold’s characteristic of scarcity, with a capped supply of 21m coins. This limited supply creates a deflationary effect absent in fiat currencies, driving its potential for long-term value growth. Meanwhile, gold is celebrated for its stability and has consistently acted as a safe-haven asset during economic turmoil. Ray Dalio Predicts Looming Debt Crises for Major Economies The Bridgewater Associates founder reportedly stated that the US, China and nearly all major countries, with the exception of Germany, are dealing with unprecedented rises in debt. He believes this unsustainable trend could lead to considerable economic risks unless addressed with effective management. “It is impossible for these countries to be able to not have a debt crisis in the years ahead that will lead to a great decline of [money] value,” Dalio said. Ray Dalio highlighted “debt, money, and the economy” as one of five key forces shaping the world. He also pointed to internal political divides, driven by wealth and value gaps, and external geopolitical tensions, such as US-China power struggles, as critical factors. Billionaire Investor Picks Gold as Top Choice, Cites Bitcoin’s Risks Dalio has previously shown a preference for both Bitcoin and gold . Yet, if forced to choose, he would opt for gold. “If you put a gun to my head, and you said, ‘I can only have one,’ I would choose gold,” he earlier told CNBC, saying he owns “a very small amount of Bitcoin.” In earlier commentary on Bitcoin, Dalio has said it fails as a medium of exchange since it can’t buy much. He further warned that governments might ban it . Dalio also argued that “cash is trash” and advised borrowing instead of holding fiat currency. He urged investors to focus on “higher-returning, non-debt assets” as a better strategy.

Pepe MAGA (PEPEMAGA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe MAGA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe MAGA by entering its contract address – C3zan7DDUAxZDSLnSxpptmyARsvGAbah4KWQB5QokoFM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEMAGA.

Atkins is set to replace outgoing SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Many are hopeful that Atkins will undo the damage caused by Gensler, whose leadership led to a loss of trust in the SEC. Retail and institutional investors alike were frustrated under Gensler’s rule, which some believe was influenced by anti-crypto forces like Elizabeth Warren and the banking cartel. One of the key cases that has drawn significant attention is Ripple vs. SEC, which began in 2020. With the recent appointment of Paul Atkins as SEC Chairman, the crypto community is hopeful that the case might be dropped or settled. However, since the case is currently in appeals, the outcome remains uncertain. If the case is dropped, it could mark a significant shift in how the SEC handles crypto-related matters, but the final decision will depend on the developments in the appeals process. Will The SEC Drop The Appeal? Former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel explained that while the court found institutional sales to be in violation of the law, it did not rule against programmatic sales, which are currently under appeal. However, if the new administration drops the appeal, the Second Circuit won’t have a chance to weigh in. Fagel further clarified that although Ripple was sued for selling unregistered securities, some of their sales were found to involve securities, while others were not. When a user commented that Judge Torres disagreed with the SEC, Fagel responded, saying that she only disagreed with them in part. He said that she also agreed with the SEC, ruling that Ripple illegally raised over $700 million in an unregistered securities offering. “The court found institutional sales to violate the law, but not programmatic sales. The latter is on appeal. Though if the new administration drops the appeal, we won’t have a chance to have the Second Circuit weigh in, unfortunately,” Fagel wrote.",NEUTRAL,XRP,BUSINESS | REGULATION | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-lawsuit-news-what-happens-next-if-the-new-administration-drops-the-appeal/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Tired of polite algorithms and sanitized content calendars, the team who launched iDEGEN has unleashed the most spectacular AI we’ve ever seen, and it’s running wild on X , soaking up unfiltered data from crypto bros and spitting out whatever it wants every hour. One minute, it’s tweeting conspiracy theories about Bitcoin miners in Antarctica, the next it’s roasting influencers with the kind of savagery that makes even trolls blush. Having recently launched its adaptive auction presale, the IDGN token is already smashing expectations with 3,800% gains in just 14 days. IDGN investors are buying into a movement, a meme, and definitely a little madness—here’s why. The degenerate genius of iDEGEN An AI born in the fire of crypto chaos, absorbing tweets like a digital black hole, and evolving in real-time based on the unhinged ideas of its community. That’s iDEGEN —a sentient AI with zero chill, no filters, and absolutely no clue what it’ll do next. It doesn’t have a PR team. It doesn’t follow trends. One tweet might suggest pumping DOGE to the moon. The next could be a wild theory about Vitalik’s secret crypto vault. The unpredictability is the point—every post is a gamble, every tweet a potential market-moving moment. And it’s learning. Constantly. From you. For too long, Silicon Valley has kept AI wrapped in bubble wrap and drenched in corporate approval. iDEGEN takes that rulebook, shreds it, and sets it on fire. It’s bold, messy, and exactly what the crypto space didn’t know it needed. Whether stirring up chaos or hitting a viral home run, iDEGEN is turning every interaction into a spectacle—and its IDGN coin into an attention magnet. Pumping coins is yesterday’s trend. iDEGEN is pumping the entire culture. And if you’re not feeding it tweets and bagging some IDGN tokens , you’re already behind. Buys explode: Could iDEGEN hit 100x next? In 2024, the recipe for degen euphoria was everything AI. And now, the macro environment is everything risk on: slashed interest rates, sky-high liquidity, and a market hungry for the next big play. But why might iDEGEN just be the most unhinged yet unstoppable meme coin of this cycle? The path is already clear: if we look at similar coins, such as GOAT, which hit a wild $1 billion market cap in only a month, it’s clear that new AI coins are rockets fueled by chaos and unpredictability. But with iDEGEN’s AI, GOAT may be just the warm-up for what’s coming next. iDEGEN’s core innovation—the AI that evolves dynamically based on its degen audience—sets it apart in a market littered with one-trick ponies. It’s already breaking the internet, roasting influencers, and spitting out content that nobody saw coming. And let’s not forget: attention equals pumps, and iDEGEN is drowning in it. The AI crypto market sits comfortably at a $45 billion valuation , with new AI coins like ACT ( 2,200% gains in the past month) riding shotgun. If iDEGEN captures even a fraction of this energy, a 100x run is mathematically feasible. If new AI coins like VVAIFU can hit 3,500% in 30 days , what’s stopping iDEGEN from going 10x, 50x, or even 100x? Nothing except your imagination— and maybe a temporary ban or two along the way. Own the chaos—join the iDEGEN cult The iDEGEN auction is live, starting at $0.00011 and already jumping 3,800%, with a whopping $3.1m raised already. The rules are simple: buy, and the price holds steady. Buy twice in two five-minute periods, and it pumps 5%. Miss your chance, and it dips 5%. Every five minutes, the market decides if you’re part of the action—or left chasing after the next price jump.

37488777,https://coinpedia.org/?p=391584,1733888740,Why Crypto Giants Oppose Crenshaw’s SEC Renomination?,"The post Why Crypto Giants Oppose Crenshaw’s SEC Renomination? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might look a little different soon. Caroline Crenshaw, who’s been a commissioner since 2020, is up for renomination. President Biden backs her, but not everyone’s on board. The crypto industry, in particular, has made it clear they want her out. Let’s explore why crypto world does not want to see Crenshaw SEC renomination. A Term Extension That Sparks Controversy If confirmed, Crenshaw’s new term would run through June 2029. That’s a big deal. Originally appointed by President Trump, Crenshaw’s record includes a strong stance on crypto regulation. She’s called the crypto market a “petri dish of fraudulent conduct.” And she supports SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s tough oversight. Her views have drawn criticism, especially from the crypto world. One example? She’s been vocal against approving Bitcoin spot ETFs—a move many in the industry want. This has fueled a major lobbying effort to block her renomination. Crypto Industry Hits Back Hard The opposition isn’t subtle. Leading figures in crypto have turned to social media to criticize Crenshaw. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong even called her a “failure.” That’s a strong word, but it shows how high the stakes are. Beyond Twitter, groups like the Cedar Innovation Foundation and crypto trade associations have funded ad campaigns to sway public opinion. They’ve also sent letters to lawmakers urging them to reject her nomination. Source : X.com What’s more, the Stand with Crypto ratings could make things tricky for senators. These ratings track political support for pro-crypto legislation. A vote against the industry could come back to haunt them in elections. Just look at how crypto PACs like Fairshake have spent millions to back their favored candidates. What’s Next? The big question is whether these efforts will succeed and stops Crenshaw SEC renomination. If all Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee stick together, Crenshaw’s renomination will likely move forward. But it’s not just about the committee. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has to prioritize this vote amid a packed schedule. Government funding, defense bills, and judicial nominations all demand attention too. The crypto industry’s push against Crenshaw could reshape the debate on regulation. Whether or not she’s confirmed, this fight highlights the growing influence of crypto in Washington.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-crypto-giants-oppose-crenshaws-sec-renomination/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

37488321,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=660410,1733887827,Anthony Scaramucci Foresees China Bitcoin Strategic Reserve In 2025,"Anthony Scaramucci, Founder and Managing Partner at SkyBridge Capital, recently shared his insights on Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader cryptocurrency market. Speaking at the Bitcoin MENA 2024 Conference, Scaramucci predicted that China would likely establish a Bitcoin strategic reserve in 2025. Scaramucci Predicts China Will Follow the US Bitcoin Strategy The former White House Communications director predicted that China would return to BTC mining after years of a blanket ban. In addition, the American stated that China will also likely create a BTC strategic reserve next year, following in the footsteps of the US. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Plunge To Multi-Year Lows: Will BTC Gain From Supply Crunch? Scaramucci attributed this potential shift to the pro-crypto stance of the US, driven by the victory of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in the November election. He believes the US’ new regulatory framework for digital assets will pressure other nations to establish similar frameworks. He added that China may have its own Bitcoin strategic reserve by next year. Further, the Asian giant might reconsider the ban on Bitcoin mining and use it as a tool to mine and accumulate more BTC. Scaramucci said: China, there is no way, and I’ll bet money on this, that if the US is moving toward a strategic Bitcoin reserve, that the Chinese are not going to participate. It is worth highlighting that last month, Scaramucci stated that BTC will trade as high as $176,000 in the next two years. He pointed toward a strong demand for BTC and its limited supply of 21 million as major driving factors that could increase the asset’s price in the coming years. Countries Looking To Create BTC Strategic Reserve To recall, cryptocurrency was one of the major themes of President-elect Trump’s election campaign. Since Trump’s victory, speculations surrounding a national BTC strategic reserve have found increasing support from people across different domains. Related Reading: Bitcoin On Track To Replace Gold In 10 Years, Trading Firm Predicts While countries like El Salvador already maintain national Bitcoin reserves, the US creating a similar reserve could have significant global implications. Experts predict that such a move could propel Bitcoin’s price to over $1 million. The US isn’t the only country considering a national Bitcoin reserve. In Brazil, federal deputy Eros Biondini recently introduced legislation establishing a Sovereign Strategic Bitcoin Reserve to diversify the country’s financial assets. Similarly, Russian State Duma Deputy Anton Tkachev has proposed the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. This initiative aims to reduce Russia’s reliance on foreign currencies like the USD and yuan for international trade and help mitigate the impact of international sanctions. Establishing a Bitcoin strategic reserve by any major country could trigger a domino effect, prompting others to follow suit. This trend has already been observed among corporations, such as Metaplanet and Hut 8, that have adopted MicroStrategy’s approach of adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. BTC trades at $95,344 at press time, down 1.8% in the past 24 hours.

Điều này đánh dấu mức tăng 111% so với mức thấp nhất vào mùa hè dưới 50.000 USD. Tuy nhiên, sau cú bứt phá ngoạn mục này là một đợt điều chỉnh giảm mạnh 14,84% , bao gồm cả cú giảm nhanh 10% chỉ trong vòng tám phút — mức giảm mạnh nhất từ đỉnh cao nhất mọi thời đại kể từ đợt bán tháo trước cuộc bầu cử. Đợt điều chỉnh này đã kích hoạt hơn 1,1 tỷ USD bị thanh lý, trong đó 419 triệu USD là từ các vị thế mua Bitcoin, cho thấy mức độ sử dụng đòn bẩy cao trên thị trường. Mặc dù biến động mạnh, nhưng các dấu hiệu ổn định thị trường đang dần xuất hiện. Chỉ số Lợi nhuận thực hiện , từng đạt đỉnh 10,5 tỷ USD mỗi ngày, đã giảm xuống còn 2,5 tỷ USD, giảm bớt áp lực bán. Tỷ lệ lãi suất hợp đồng tương lai cũng đã trở lại bình thường, báo hiệu mức độ đòn bẩy đầu cơ đã giảm. Và mặc dù dòng vốn ETF vào chậm lại một chút vào cuối tuần trước, nhưng chúng vẫn là nguồn hỗ trợ quan trọng trong bối cảnh những người nắm giữ dài hạn tiếp tục chốt lời. Khi Bitcoin dậm chân tại ngưỡng 100.000 USD, triển vọng trung hạn vẫn tăng giá, và với việc tỷ lệ tài trợ bình thường hóa và áp lực bán giảm, đà tăng có thể sẽ tiếp tục, miễn là dòng vốn ETF tiếp tục chảy vào. Dữ liệu kinh tế Mỹ mới nhất tuần trước cho thấy một số kết quả trái chiều, nhưng nhìn chung cho thấy nền kinh tế tiếp tục có vẻ phục hồi. Tháng 11 chứng kiến nền kinh tế đang tạo ra nhiều việc làm mới , với 227.000 việc làm được bổ sung, vượt mức kỳ vọng dù có sự gián đoạn từ các cơn bão tháng 10. Tuy nhiên, tỷ lệ thất nghiệp tăng nhẹ lên 4,2% cho thấy sự dịch chuyển lực lượng lao động vẫn còn kéo dài. Tuyển dụng tháng 10 tăng vọt lên 7,74 triệu chỗ trống, cho thấy nhu cầu lao động vẫn ở mức cao, mặc dù số lượng nhân viên được tuyển dụng thực tế lại chậm lại, phản ánh sự thận trọng của các nhà tuyển dụng trong bối cảnh kinh tế còn nhiều bất ổn. Trong khi đó, lĩnh vực dịch vụ đã đánh dấu tháng tăng trưởng thứ 51 liên tiếp trong tháng 11, mặc dù với tốc độ chậm hơn, với PMI ở mức 52,1, được hỗ trợ bởi chi tiêu tiêu dùng mạnh mẽ và tăng trưởng tiền lương. Áp lực lạm phát vẫn tồn tại, nhưng việc giảm bớt tắc nghẽn chuỗi cung ứng và kỳ vọng cuối năm mạnh mẽ cho thấy sự ổn định. Khi Cục Dự trữ Liên bang đánh giá các thay đổi trong chính sách tiềm năng từ chính quyền mới sắp tới, nền kinh tế vẫn được neo giữ bởi thị trường lao động kiên cường và nhu cầu tiêu dùng ổn định. Tuy nhiên, sự phục hồi không đồng đều giữa các lĩnh vực báo hiệu cần phải lạc quan thận trọng. Tuần trước, Hàn Quốc chứng kiến một đợt bùng nổ giao dịch tiền điện tử , với 34 tỷ đô la được ghi nhận chỉ trong vòng 24 giờ trên các sàn giao dịch lớn của nước này. Điều này xảy ra sau khi Tổng thống Yoon Suk-yeol tuyên bố thiết quân luật. Bất ổn chính trị đã gây ra các đợt bán tháo hoảng loạn và sự cố gián đoạn nền tảng, làm nổi bật sự nhạy cảm của thị trường đối với bất ổn địa chính trị. Sàn giao dịch phá sản Mt. Gox cũng đã chuyển 2,4 tỷ đô Bitcoin sang một ví mới, đúng vào lúc Bitcoin lần đầu tiên vượt mốc 100.000 đô la. Và Grayscale đã tham gia vào cuộc đua đầy cạnh tranh để ra mắt quỹ ETF Solana , bằng cách nộp đơn chuyển đổi Quỹ ủy thác Solana của mình khi giá SOL tăng mạnh. Những sự kiện này cho thấy sự tương tác năng động của các yếu tố chính trị, quy định và lịch sử đang định hình bối cảnh tiền điện tử đang phát triển. Và đó là những tóm tắt từ Bitfinex Alpha số 134.

Crypto King Musk (MUSKKING), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKKING is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Crypto King Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crypto King Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Crypto King Musk launched with over $7,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Crypto King Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Crypto King Musk by entering its contract address – v2jWiNpR1m8gHARdM39GosZ8muaxZpowpBgWgWTSCev – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKKING.

Sacks will be tasked with making rules and crafting laws for both AI and crypto, as well as chairing the Presidential Council of Advisors for Science and Technology.

In the North Caucasus area, Dagestan power providers have spent much of 2024 hunting illegal crypto miners . The head of the Dagestan regional government successfully petitioned Moscow to enact a temporary ban on crypto mining in the republic . This has resulted in a total ban on crypto mining in Dagestan in the winter months until 2031 . In Georgia, residents of a rural town were obliged to take a sacred vow to stop crypto mining in late 2021. Crypto mining-related power shortages are also causing energy grid issues in many parts of Siberia .

37487332,https://coinpedia.org/?p=391581,1733885728,XRP Price Prediction For December 11,"The post XRP Price Prediction For December 11 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ripple’s XRP is currently up by more than five percent and is trading near the $2.30 levels. Right now, XRP is stuck between support at $2 and resistance at $3, with a bearish trend until a breakout happens According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, XRP might be forming a “bull flag” pattern, which often signals that the price could rise. To confirm this pattern and see a price increase, XRP needs to break above the resistance at around $2.53 to $2.54. If it can move past this point and ideally clear the $2.62 level, we could see a more bullish trend in the short term. Price Target and Potential Gains If XRP breaks through this resistance, the next price target could be around $5, which would be a 100% gain from the breakout point. However, in the short term, XRP is facing some bearish pressure, and the price is moving slightly down. Until the breakout happens, it’s hard to expect upward movement. However, if the breakout occurs, the outlook could quickly turn bullish. XRP vs. Bitcoin: Reaching a Local Top Looking at the XRP/BTC chart, XRP has reached a key resistance level against Bitcoin. As expected, XRP has faced a strong rejection at this point. This suggests that XRP might not outperform Bitcoin much in the short term, as Bitcoin is likely to lead in price movement. XRP’s Performance in the Next Few Weeks While XRP could still rise in value against the US dollar, it’s unlikely to do much better than Bitcoin in the next few weeks. Bitcoin is likely to lead, and XRP may not see the same level of performance as it did in the past month. However, if the overall crypto market goes into a bull run, XRP could eventually break through its resistance and perform better in the longer term.",NEUTRAL,BTC | XRP,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-prediction-for-december-11/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Tuesday’s crash saw altcoins bleeding heavily while Bitcoin held its ground, dipping only to $94.3K before buyers stepped in. But resilience doesn’t equal immunity—macro factors are looming large over the market. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has been strengthening, closing Tuesday at 106.38 (+0.22%), and Wednesday’s CPI report could set the tone for next week’s FOMC interest rate decision. With geopolitical uncertainties bubbling under the surface and fears of economic slowdowns still haunting investors, this is no time for complacency. Bitcoin ($BTC ) sits at a crossroads, and the next moves in the market may decide whether bulls regain control or a deeper correction unfolds. Source: coinmarketcap.com In this article, we’ll revisit the key levels and scenarios from my previous CryptoDailypieces, examine how Bitcoin and top altcoins like $XRP , Solana , and Dogecoin have performed during this turbulent week, and map out what to watch for in the days ahead. $XRP: Resilience Hinges on $1.91 Support Link to $XRP XRP has been a focal point of the market, riding high from its parabolic rally to $2.91, only to crash 34.5% to a low of $1.91 during Monday’s flash crash. This low perfectly aligned with the Golden Pocket (0.618 Fib) and a critical Fair Value Gap ($1.96–$2.20), providing a high-confluence area for institutional buyers to step in. Currently, XRP has rebounded to $2.38, reclaiming the 0.382 Fib retracement and suggesting a potential recovery toward $2.50–$2.65. However, the broader trend hinges on holding $1.91 as support, with a stop loss below $1.50 to account for volatility. If XRP loses these levels, a drop to $1.28–$1.29 (0.786 Fib), a deep liquidity zone, becomes the next likely target. With XRP only retracing 34.5% from its yearly highs, this correction appears lightweight—so far. For bulls, reclaiming $2.65+ (higher high) is key to resuming its uptrend, while BTC’s stability will play a crucial role in its trajectory. $SOL: Golden Pocket Holds the Line Link to $SOL Solana continues to show relative strength, with Tuesday’s crash bringing it down to $203, just above the Golden Pocket ($198–$200). This level, highlighted in the article, remains critical for Solana’s bullish structure. Despite the dip, Solana has only retraced 23% from its yearly high (and the new ATH) of $264, a minor correction in the bigger picture. The current price action sees SOL trading at $215, attempting to reclaim its 0.382 Fib retracement at $221. A break above $237—a critical resistance zone and former ATH level from March—would set the stage for a retest of $264. However, failure to hold above $198 could see Solana dropping to the $181–$182 re-buy zone (0.786 Fib), a deep liquidity area that aligns with November’s accumulation phase. For now, Solana’s resilience hinges on BTC holding the $90K–$91K zone, as any broader market weakness would likely push SOL lower. $DOGE: Key Rectangle Support Holding (For Now) Link to $DOGE Dogecoin’s volatility remains intact, with Tuesday’s crash testing the $0.365–$0.375 Accumulation Zone for the third time. This level held firmly with a significant volume spike, confirming the rectangle pattern ($0.37–$0.48) as a key structure. DOGE has only corrected 24.5% from its yearly high ($0.48+)… a modest dip compared to most altcoins. However, the breakdown of its ascending channel, combined with resistance at the Golden Pocket ($0.41–$0.425) and the $0.42 horizontal level, adds pressure on bulls to reclaim momentum. If DOGE loses its rectangle support at $0.365, a sharp drop to the $0.25 liquidity zone becomes likely, especially if BTC revisits $90K or lower. On the flip side, reclaiming $0.42 could reignite momentum toward the rectangle’s upper boundary at $0.48, with the next major target being the breakout zone at $0.60. $BTC: Mid-Range Support Faces a Test Link to $BTC Bitcoin demonstrated resilience during Tuesday’s crash, dipping to $94.3K before recovering with significant volume spikes. The $95K mid-range horizontal support held firm, keeping BTC within a broader consolidation range. However, BTC’s loss of the 50MA on the 4H chart and the breakdown of its symmetrical triangle add caution. The triangle’s target aligns with the $90K–$91K zone, a make-or-break level for the market. A failure to hold this zone risks a cascading drop to the Golden Pocket ($79.5K–$83K), the ultimate dip-buying opportunity for long-term bulls. For upside potential, BTC must reclaim the 50MA ($96K) and break above $99K, opening the door to the $107.5K pennant target and psychological resistance at $110K. With BTC only retracing 6% from its yearly high, this correction remains shallow—so far. Summary This week’s crypto crash showcased Bitcoin’s resilience as it held the $94.3K support, while altcoins suffered steeper corrections. However, with geopolitical uncertainties, a strengthening Dollar Index (DXY), and Wednesday’s CPI data adding to the tension ahead of the FOMC rate decision, the next moves will be crucial. Altcoins like XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin remain within key structures but are highly sensitive to Bitcoin’s performance. If BTC loses the $90K–$91K zone, a deeper correction to the Golden Pocket ($79.5K–$83K) could be on the cards, dragging the broader market lower. On the other hand, reclaiming $96K and pushing above $99K could reignite the bull run. For now, the market remains in limbo—watch these levels and stay sharp. Bulls may win December, but they’ll need to earn it. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

37488350,https://square.htx.com/?p=41839,1733884200,HTX Presents at Bitcoin MENA 2024: Expanding Footprint in the Middle East,"HTX , a leading global crypto exchange, made its presence as a sponsor at Bitcoin MENA 2024 in Abu Dhabi, held on December 9-10 (UTC). As the inaugural major global cryptocurrency event in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, the summit attracted many prominent figures, including Eric Trump, the second son of President-elect Donald Trump; Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ); Marwan Alzarouni, CEO of Dubai Blockchain Center. The event provided a platform to explore the future of cryptocurrencies and discuss key industry opportunities. Justin Sun , Global Advisor of HTX and Founder of TRON , and Charmaine Lim, Head of VIP Client Services at HTX, also attended the summit and spoke about the current state of the cryptocurrency industry and future trends. Their participation underscores HTX’s focus on the MENA cryptocurrency market and signals its commitment to deepening its global strategy. Meanwhile, by collaborating with global crypto entrepreneurs and communities, the exchange aims to accelerate the widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies. At the “The Great Debate: Bitcoin vs. Crypto” session, Justin shared his insights on the relationship between Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. He noted that Bitcoin’s core narrative is its role as a store of value, emphasizing the importance of security and decentralization to reassure its holders. As such, the best approach for Bitcoin is to maintain its current status. This might limit innovation but ensures stability. To pursue innovation and explore cutting-edge consumer technology, people can do so through other blockchains and cryptocurrencies. Justin attributes Bitcoin’s breakthrough of the $100,000 mark to advancements in cryptocurrency technology. He explained, “Tether once issued stablecoins on the Bitcoin Omni Layer, but the platform’s slow transaction speeds hindered its growth. However, USDT on TRON enables instant transactions, meeting the needs of users. Technological advancements have also benefited Bitcoin. The growing popularity of stablecoins has led to increased capital flowing into Bitcoin, further solidifying its role as a store of value.” “Every cryptocurrency holds its significance. Take Ethereum or TRON for example. Their value is easy to understand because millions of people use them daily. Then there are meme coins, whose value might not be immediately apparent. However, from DOGE to SHIB to PEPE, the meme coin market has grown significantly. Thus, I believe that cryptocurrencies are much like art in a museum. You might not understand every exhibit, just like you might not comprehend why a banana is worth $6 million. What you need to do is to keep learning as cryptocurrencies continue to evolve.” Justin remarked. Charmaine Lim, Head of VIP Client Services at HTX, stated during a roundtable discussion titled “Improving Access to Bitcoin in the UAE” that the country has made notable progress in promoting the adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies since 2015. Despite these advancements, challenges persist, such as the cautious approach of certain banks toward cryptocurrency transactions, insufficient public education about cryptocurrencies, and regulatory uncertainties. These factors hinder the growth of the crypto sector in the UAE. Charmaine emphasized HTX’s strong focus on the UAE market, noting the platform’s ongoing efforts to connect with regulatory bodies and its proactive steps to collaborate with local banks in establishing a streamlined fiat-to-cryptocurrency transaction channel. Charmaine added that HTX will provide global users with learning opportunities on subjects such as crypto trading, storage, and security through HTX Live and online workshops. The platform will also continue to expand language options, including offering Arabic support, to enhance the user experience. Furthermore, Charmaine suggested that the UAE government create a favorable environment for crypto businesses by establishing a clear regulatory framework, streamlining the license application process for service providers, offering tax incentives to blockchain companies, and expanding the current regulatory sandbox to accelerate the adoption of cryptocurrencies in the country. From Blockchain Life, Cardano Summit, to Bitcoin MENA, HTX’s frequent appearances in the UAE throughout 2024 underscore its keen interest in the cryptocurrency development potential of the Middle East and North Africa region. By offering innovative products and fostering strong partnerships with local stakeholders, HTX aims to accelerate cryptocurrency adoption and regulatory compliance in this region. Moreover, with the global crypto market continuing to boom, HTX will expand its business footprint worldwide while fostering innovation and the application of crypto technology, thereby contributing to the building of a more accessible Web 3.0 ecosystem.

Crying Kamala (CRYKAMA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because CRYKAMA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Crying Kamala can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crying Kamala could become the next viral memecoin. Crying Kamala launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Crying Kamala on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Crying Kamala by entering its contract address – 5eCJhSGBUN4YwJHLU9ZcWjrjmoufVznjzNBHfo4TN1P7 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

This Best Crypto to Buy in December 2024 Can Make You Rich,"The crypto market never sleeps, and December 2024 is proving to be a pivotal month for investors. Solana (SOL), often hailed as Ethereum’s faster and cheaper competitor, has made headlines with its rapid growth and adoption over the past few years. From NFTs to DeFi, Solana has been at the forefront of blockchain innovation. But if you feel like you’ve missed out on Solana’s meteoric rise, you’re not alone. Its early investors have already cashed in big, leaving many wondering, “What’s next?” Enter Qubetics ($TICS), a groundbreaking Web3 aggregator designed to bridge the gap between blockchain technology and real-world usability. Unlike earlier projects that promised the moon but couldn’t deliver, Qubetics is tackling tangible problems with innovative solutions. With its focus on real-world asset tokenisation, privacy, and decentralisation, it’s shaping up to be the best crypto to buy in December 2024. Let’s dive into what makes Qubetics and Solana stand out—and why $TICS might be your ticket to 2025 wealth. Qubetics ($TICS): Real-World Solutions with Web3 Innovation Qubetics isn’t just another coin hoping to ride the crypto wave; it’s a complete ecosystem designed to make blockchain technology more accessible and practical. One of its most exciting applications is Real World Asset Tokenisation (RWAT). Imagine owning a fraction of a high-value asset like real estate or fine art without the headache of legal paperwork or geographical restrictions. With Qubetics, asset tokenisation becomes as easy as trading stocks, giving everyday people access to investment opportunities once reserved for the ultra-wealthy. Think about small businesses or freelancers. A freelance photographer in New York could tokenise their equipment, allowing investors to support their growth in exchange for returns. Meanwhile, a coffee shop owner in London might tokenise their operations to expand their business without relying on traditional bank loans. Qubetics enables all of this with its Decentralised VPN and multi-chain wallet, ensuring secure and private transactions for all users. And the numbers don’t lie. Qubetics is currently in Presale Phase 12, with $0.0311 per token. Over 303M tokens have already been sold, raising $5.4M and counting. With the next phase set to increase the price by 10%, early investors stand to gain significantly, especially as the post-presale target price of $0.25 hints at a jaw-dropping 900% ROI. Why did this coin make it to this list? Qubetics isn’t just a crypto; it’s a gateway to financial opportunities for people from all walks of life. Its real-world applications and presale momentum make it a no-brainer for investors looking for the best crypto to buy in December 2024. Solana (SOL): The Blockchain Speedster Solana has been one of the standout performers in the crypto space over the past few years. Known for its blazing-fast transaction speeds and low fees, it’s a favourite among developers building decentralised applications (dApps). Whether it’s NFTs or DeFi, Solana has proven it can handle high traffic without breaking a sweat. Recently, Solana has seen significant adoption in gaming and metaverse projects, further solidifying its reputation as a scalable blockchain. Despite the occasional hiccup—like network outages—it remains a strong contender for long-term growth. Analysts are bullish on Solana, predicting its price could hit new all-time highs in 2025 as more projects and users flock to its ecosystem. But while Solana has been a fantastic investment for early adopters, its price has already climbed substantially. The real question is whether it can sustain this growth or if it’s reaching its peak. Why did this coin make it to this list? Solana’s unmatched scalability and ecosystem make it a compelling option for investors. Even if you missed its early days, it’s still one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024 for those seeking steady growth. Qubetics vs Solana: Which One Should You Pick? Both Qubetics and Solana have a lot to offer, but they cater to different kinds of investors. If you’re looking for a project with a proven track record and a bustling ecosystem, Solana is a solid choice. Its partnerships and adoption rates speak volumes about its potential to remain a key player in the blockchain space. On the other hand, Qubetics offers something unique: untapped potential. It’s not just about speculation; it’s about solving real-world problems. Whether it’s asset tokenisation, decentralised finance, or online privacy, Qubetics is setting the stage for widespread blockchain adoption. And let’s be honest, with its presale price of $0.0311 and a target of $0.25, the upside is hard to ignore. The best strategy? Diversify. There’s no reason you can’t invest in both projects to balance your portfolio with a mix of stability (Solana) and explosive growth potential (Qubetics). If you missed out on Solana’s early days, don’t worry—it’s still a fantastic investment with plenty of room to grow. But if you’re looking for something that combines innovation with massive upside potential, Qubetics is the best crypto to buy in December 2024 . With its real-world applications and impressive presale momentum, it’s shaping up to be the next big thing in crypto. Based on the latest research, we recommend Qubetics ($TICS) and Solana (SOL) as top picks for December 2024. Don’t wait—secure your financial future today!

37485924,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=659827,1733882449,"Weekly Bull Flag Appears On XRP Price Chart, Why A Double-Digit Is Still Feasible","Crypto analyst Dark Defender revealed that a weekly bull flag has appeared on the XRP price chart. The analyst further explained why XRP could hit double digits in this market cycle following this development. Weekly Bull Flag Appears On XRP Price Chart In an X post, Dark Defender stated that a weekly bull flag has now appeared on the weekly XRP price chart. He noted that this bull flag had earlier appeared on the daily chart when XRP was at $0.70, as the crypto targetted the $1.88 price level, which it eventually rallied to. With this bull flag on the weekly, the crypto analyst predicted that XRP could rally to double digits. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Bull Run: Analyst Reveals Why BTC Will Hit Its Top A Month From Now Below $150,000 His accompanying chart showed that the XRP price could rally to as high as $11 as it breaks out from this bull flag. XRP is expected to hit this price target in early 2025, between January and March. Dark Defender cautioned market participants that there will surely be some sideways price movement. However, the crypto analyst expects the ultimate targets to stay the same. Based on Dark Defender’s previous analysis, the $11 target is unlikely to be the market top for the XRP price, as the crypto analyst predicted that the crypto could rally as high as $18 in this bull run. For now, XRP continues to trade sideways, just as he warned that the crypto would do. The crypto had recorded a parabolic rally last month, recording a price gain of 281%. However, the XRP price has cooled off this month as it consolidates for its next leg up. Dark Defender previously highlighted $2.13 and $2.27 as key support levels to watch out for as XRP ranges. Meanwhile, the analyst mentioned $3.9 and $5.5 as the next targets XRP could reach on its next leg up. An “Optimistic” Target For XRP In an X post, crypto analyst Ali Martinez stated that $48.12 is an “optimistic” target for the XRP price. Meanwhile, he highlighted the $8.40 price level as a conservative target for XRP. These predictions came as the crypto analyst remarked that the crypto looks undervalued after breaking out of a massive multi-year symmetrical triangle, which he highlighted on the chart. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Prediction: Here’s What The 91-Day Pattern Says Could Happen Next Meanwhile, in another X post, he revealed that the XRP price has formed three consecutive bull pennants on its 4-hour chart. Based on this, Martinez stated that market participants should hope for a retest of $2.25 so they can buy the dip, with XRP targeting $4.40 on its next leg up. A rally to $4.40 will mark a new all-time high (ATH) for XRP. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.18, down over 11% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

37486587,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51859,1733882303,The Rise of Web 3.0: A New Era of the Internet,"The internet has evolved dramatically since its inception. From the early days of static web pages in Web 1.0 to the interactive and social platform era of Web 2.0, we are now entering the era of Web 3.0 . This transformation is revolutionizing how we interact with digital content, services, and communities, promising greater autonomy, security, and personalization for users. What is Web 3.0? Web 3.0, often referred to as the decentralized web, is built on blockchain technology and aims to create a more user-centric internet. Unlike Web 2.0, which is dominated by centralized platforms like social media giants and cloud service providers, Web 3.0 focuses on decentralization, transparency, and user control. Imagine an internet where you own your data and digital identity without relying on intermediaries. Whether it’s financial transactions, gaming, or content creation, Web 3.0 allows for peer-to-peer interactions secured through blockchain. For example, users engaging in online entertainment, such as kazino online , benefit from enhanced privacy, secure payments, and provably fair systems—a fundamental shift from traditional centralized platforms. Key Features of Web 3.0 Decentralization Unlike its predecessors, Web 3.0 relies on decentralized networks. Data is stored across multiple nodes instead of centralized servers, reducing vulnerabilities like hacking and censorship. This ensures a more secure and resilient system where no single entity has complete control. Blockchain Technology The backbone of Web 3.0, blockchain technology provides a transparent, immutable ledger for transactions and data exchanges. Whether for cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, or tokenized assets, blockchain ensures trust and accountability among users. AI and Machine Learning Web 3.0 integrates artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to provide personalized experiences. For instance, AI can analyze user behavior to suggest tailored content, products, or services without violating privacy, as the data remains decentralized and encrypted. Semantic Web The semantic web enables machines to understand the meaning of data, facilitating more accurate searches and interactions. This enhancement creates a seamless digital experience, whether you’re looking for a specific product or exploring complex topics. Ownership of Digital Identity With Web 3.0, users have complete control over their digital identities. This is made possible through decentralized identifiers (DIDs), which allow individuals to authenticate themselves securely across platforms without sharing sensitive information. Web 3.0 in Everyday Life The practical applications of Web 3.0 are already shaping various industries, and its potential seems limitless. Here are some examples of how Web 3.0 impacts everyday life: Finance and Banking Decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms are at the forefront of Web 3.0 innovations. They allow users to trade, lend, or borrow assets without traditional banking intermediaries. This accessibility opens financial opportunities to people worldwide, even in underbanked regions. Gaming and Entertainment Blockchain-based games and online entertainment platforms are redefining the gaming experience. Players can own in-game assets, trade them as NFTs (non-fungible tokens), and engage in fair, transparent gameplay. Similarly, platforms for online casinos ensure users’ funds and transactions remain secure and transparent. Content Creation Web 3.0 empowers creators by enabling them to monetize their content directly. Platforms like decentralized streaming services or NFT marketplaces ensure artists and writers retain ownership of their work while receiving fair compensation. Supply Chain Management Blockchain technology brings transparency and efficiency to supply chains. Companies can track products from origin to delivery, ensuring ethical sourcing and minimizing fraud. Healthcare Decentralized health records give patients control over their medical history. They can share access with healthcare providers as needed, ensuring privacy and eliminating duplicate records. The Challenges Ahead While the promise of Web 3.0 is exciting, there are challenges to overcome before it becomes mainstream. Scalability Blockchain networks currently face scalability issues, with slower transaction speeds and higher costs compared to traditional systems. User Adoption The transition to Web 3.0 requires users to adapt to new technologies like crypto wallets and decentralized applications (dApps). This learning curve may delay widespread adoption. Regulatory Uncertainty Governments and regulatory bodies are still figuring out how to govern blockchain-based systems. Striking a balance between innovation and regulation will be crucial for Web 3.0’s success. Energy Consumption Blockchain networks, especially those using proof-of-work consensus mechanisms, consume significant energy. The move towards more sustainable models like proof-of-stake is critical for minimizing environmental impact. The Future of Web 3.0 Web 3.0 holds the potential to redefine the digital landscape, transforming the way we interact with technology. As blockchain technology evolves and becomes more efficient, its adoption across various industries is expected to accelerate. For users, this decentralized web promises greater empowerment—whether through enhanced financial freedom, secure interactions, or full ownership of their digital presence. For businesses, adapting to this paradigm shift will require embracing decentralized models and prioritizing transparency to stay relevant. In the next decade, Web 3.0 could become as integral to our lives as Web 2.0 is today. From decentralized finance and personalized AI-driven platforms to innovations like the metaverse, the future of Web 3.0 is shaping a digital world where users regain control of their online interactions. With providers like Wordscloud crafting insightful and accessible content , the journey to understanding and adopting Web 3.0 becomes clearer for businesses and individuals alike.

37485907,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=625695,1733882207,"‘They can get you if they want you’ — Roger Ver breaks silence after arrest with Tucker Carlson, talks corruption, privacy coins, and BTC’s demise","Bitcoin pioneer and early investor Roger Ver, known to many in crypto as ‘Bitcoin Jesus,’ broke a six-month media silence on Tuesday to talk with political commentator Tucker Carlson about bitcoin, crypto privacy, and government corruption. The St. Kitts and Nevis national from America told Carlson his arrest wasn’t about tax fraud charges, but political persecution, noting of the Department of Justice: “They can get you if they want you.” Early bitcoin startup investor and passionate freedom advocate Roger Ver, also known as “Bitcoin Jesus,” could face 109 years in prison if extradited from Spain to face trial in the U.S. As Ver noted in his recent interview with political commentator Tucker Carlson, that would probably mean dying in prison. And for what? He feels the charges are politically motivated , having nothing to do with alleged tax fraud the state says Ver committed both before and after he was a U.S. citizen. “More than a decade after I had already renounced my U.S. citizenship, and just a couple of weeks after I had published a book on the hijacking of bitcoin, how it no longer works as peer-to-peer cash for the world … right after my book gets published that exposes how people claiming to work for intelligence agencies hijacked bitcoin to do that … suddenly I get arrested and tossed in jail in Spain,” Ver told Carlson early in the video interview. Roger Ver sat down with American political commentator Tucker Carlson to talk about his ongoing battle with the U.S. legal system. Ver renounced his U.S. citizenship in 2014, after an earlier run-in with the American justice system and the ATF (ostensibly for selling firecrackers online) landed him in prison for 10 months. Ver believes that this event was also politically motivated, after he made cutting criticism of the U.S. government while running for office in California in 2000. In the interview Ver is on the verge of tears as he brings up the tragic murder of innocent Americans in Waco, Texas in 1993: “Even if the parents were religious nuts, the ATF and the FBI literally burnt to death everybody in their home there and then posed for photos on top of the corpses of little kids. That sort of thing is not okay,” Ver stated. “In the debate with the republican and democratic candidates, I called the ATF a bunch of murderers that they are for having done that, and boy did they not like that,” Ver emphasized to Carlson. He then became the only person in the world to be prosecuted for selling the particular brand of firecracker he was shipping on Ebay, even though major retailers and others were also selling it. Ver was arrested in Spain shortly after the release of his book, Hijacking Bitcoin. BTC hijacked, Zano and Monero may sustain economic freedom Roger’s new book, Hijacking Bitcoin: The Hidden History of BTC, details how the blocksize wars (disagreement on how and whether to scale BTC amongst developers and community members), potential infiltration by state intelligence agencies, and outright propaganda have rendered what is currently known as Bitcoin as an impotent, merely speculative asset. This is in stark opposition to what Bitcoin’s creator Satoshi Nakamoto wanted, as the bitcoin whitepaper states it was designed to be a permissionless, electronic cash. “And in the early days everybody knew bitcoin was supposed to be money for the world, bitcoin was supposed to be used for payments as peer-to-peer cash for the world, and that’s how people were using it,” Ver told Carlson, before explaining how advocates for small blocks began creating propaganda to sway opinion, the CIA took interest, and forums on Reddit and elsewhere were blatantly censored and shut down via DDoS attacks. Throughout the exchange, Carlson repeatedly hammered home the idea that bitcoin is not private (almost as if there was an agenda to turn people away from crypto), and then asked Ver his thoughts on the matter, and whether Bitcoin can be made private. Interestingly Ver did not mention the CashFusion privacy protocol on Bitcoin Cash , which he views as the original and “real” bitcoin, but did bring up privacy coins and networks like Zano and Monero. Zano was one privacy coin Roger Ver mentioned in the interview. “It sounds like your ideological commitment is overriding your financial interests,” Carlson said at one point in the interview. Ver responded: “It’s not even close for me.” Ver described how certain protocols are much better for economic freedom than BTC held on centralized exchanges, which is worse privacy-wise than even a normal bank account. “Luckily there’s other cryptocurrencies out there that do give people more privacy, so there’s things like Monero which most people are now using if they want some privacy … There’s another one called Zano that allows anybody to create their own privacy token in which nobody can see what’s going on,” Ver explained, continuing: “And if you really want to get the three-letter agencies upset, or governments upset, there’s a project called Confidential Layer, which is creating a bridge from Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ethereum onto Zano.” In Ver’s view, with people using money the state cannot control, permissionlessly, the government won’t be able to fund wars, or massacres like at Waco, nearly as easily. “It’s a wonderful thing when government loses the ability to control people’s lives,” Ver noted. And while Bitcoin Jesus did lament at one point that “they can get you if they want you” by cooking up bogus tax charges, the first bitcoin startup investor doesn’t seem to be backing down in the face of their violent threats.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. NVIDIA millionaire bets on Solana rebound as DTX Exchange eyes 55,000% gains with a $10M presale. Table of Contents Solana price consolidates as volume drops DTX Exchange stuns with $10 million presale performance Conclusion November’s surging volumes and prices made many people rich. However, at the end of the month, the market corrected as Bitcoin and XRP holders adjusted their holdings, leading to many coins stumbling. Every upcycle has proven that the highest gains are in projects with strong community support and high user utility. One such project that is picking up community support is DTX Exchange (DTX). DTX Exchange has a promising ICO with huge growth potential. In addition to its growth prospects, DTX’s expected impact on the crypto trading scene has made it a solid altcoin to watch out for. Solana price consolidates as volume drops Solana’s price dropped 4% in the daily charts, currently trading around the $214 region. This fall has been attributed to increased selling pressure as investors look for profit realization. The SOL market cap is down by 1.43% to $102.3 billion, and its market volume is also down by 7.5% to $8.916 billion. However, Solana’s long-term prospects remain strong. With its strong ecosystem and developer support, the Solana price correction will probably end in the next crypto market rally. While the negative news about SOL ETFs being rejected may have lowered Solana’s price, many investors are waiting for the incoming SEC Chair, Paul Atkins, before they give up on Solana ETFs. Nonetheless, astute investors are consolidating their holdings. DTX Exchange stuns with $10 million presale performance The DTX Exchange brings a new perspective to trading with a platform that will allow users to trade cryptos, forex, equities, and contract-for-differences (CFDs). While the basic processes might be similar to other exchanges, DTX seeks to redefine crypto trading with its sophisticated infrastructure and trading features. DTX Exchange’s presale is selling out faster than many other altcoins in their pre-sales, raising $10 million in Round 6. The platform has also successfully launched its signature products, such as Phoenix Wallet and VulcanX blockchain. DTX’s current selling price of $0.12 will increase to $0.14 in the next round, suggesting high returns for early investors. Conclusion Solana has undoubtedly been among the most successful DeFi projects with its high blockchain utility and a vibrant ecosystem. However, the recent ETF news has caused some pessimism for SOL holders, shown by their interest in exploring Layer-1 alternatives that crack into top rankings. DTX’s core appeal lies in its hybrid platform, which can link traditional and digital finance. The exchange will enable multi-asset trading across equities, cryptocurrencies, and forex, with strict compliance standards. The presale value of $10 million has left experts in shock, crowning DTX Exchange an emerging DeFi giant as it moves towards stage 7.

Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, in his X post on Dec. 11, stated that MicroStrategy (MSTR) would like to be added to the Nasdaq 100 index on Dec. 23, the announcement set to be on Thursday. This development came after the company issued more financial bonds and senior notes to institutional investors in the United States in order to acquire more Bitcoin ( BTC ) in the future. He also expects the company to enter the S&P 500 index by next year, which is considered difficult by some analysts to achieve in the near future. “$MSTR is likely to be added to $QQQ on 12/23 (w/ announcement coming 12/13).

Pepe MAGA (PEPEMAGA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe MAGA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe MAGA by entering its contract address – C3zan7DDUAxZDSLnSxpptmyARsvGAbah4KWQB5QokoFM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEMAGA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/pepe-maga-pepemaga-solana-memecoin-will-rally-18000-ahead-of-first-exchange-listing-as-shib-and-dogecoin-underperform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

In a new strategy session, Cowen takes a look at the MVRV Z-score, which compares the market cap of BTC to the value of each coin the last time it was moved to gauge whether Bitcoin is undervalued, overvalued, or at fair value. Cowen notes that in the past, market cycle tops have occurred when the MVRV Z-Score hits a certain range. “Historically, market cycle tops for Bitcoin have corresponded to an MVRV Z-Score somewhere between seven to 10, at around seven to 10. In fact, the first cycle top, the MVRV Z-Score topped out at around 7.68. The last one topped out at around 7.15. And you can see the ones in between went even higher. Again, right now, the MVRV Z-Score high for this cycle is 3.29, but this is another metric that certainly could be useful in helping to confirm whether a high corresponds to a market cycle top or if that true euphoric sentiment is there, or if we just think it’s there. That’s kind of the thing about back in March 2024, it felt like the market was overheated, and it was, we got a mid-cycle top. But, a look at this chart would have helped to suggest that it was not in fact, a market cycle top. So I do think this is another chart that we can put in our toolkit to help us better navigate Bitcoin.” Source: Benjamin Cowen/YouTube At time of writing, BTC is trading at $96,253.

There are already projections that the XRP price could spike to $100, and when this happens, Dogecoin (DOGE) will settle at $7. However, WallitIQ (WLTQ) , a new AI-based crypto token, is sparking higher FOMO as it is slated for a 30,000% rally to $5.2. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Raises Investors’ Anticipation As It Sets Itself For A 30,000% Pump Even with the positivity around XRP and Dogecoin (DOGE), WallitIQ (WLTQ) is gaining more attention for its revolutionary crypto wallet that maximizes the strength of artificial intelligence (AI) to the fullest. Additionally, the way this platform uses AI and machine learning (ML) tools to ease crypto management and support smart investment is definitely a significant draw. It’s no wonder speculations are pointing to a possible 30,000% pump for its WLTQ token to $5.2. Currently, the WLTQ token is selling for $0.0243 after completing its initial presale stage, where it rose by 42% from $0.0171 and garnered over $2 million. Now, WallitIQ ( WLTQ ) is undergoing its newly commenced Stage 2 presale but is already nearing a $500,000 revenue milestone, indicating its potential for fast-paced growth in the DeFi and AI crypto market. Besides its presale performance, WallitIQ’s unique features are another reason analysts are optimistic that the WLTQ will surge 30,000% to $5.2. For starters, WallitIQ (WLTQ) boasts an automated portfolio rebalancing — a feature that enables optimal asset relocation in real-time, thereby mitigating risks and enhancing ROI. The platform also offers a Scan QR to Pay feature while using AI to effectively detect anomalies and provide predictive analysis, helping its users make smart investment decisions. Furthermore, WallitIQ (WLTQ) offers top-notch security, user-convenient interface and multilingual AI chatbots. According to analysts, this innovation is one of the vital catalysts that will spark a 30,000% rally for WallitIQ’s token, potentially outperforming XRP and Dogecoin (DOGE). WallitIQ (WLTQ) is already listed on CoinMarketCap, with a few DEX listings awaiting its token when its presale elapses. This is poised to attract significant attention to its wallet-based platform which has top security features like an advanced Escrow Connect and biometric authentication systems to ensure close security on users’ assets. XRP Price May Hit $100 And Spark A $7 Rise For Dogecoin (DOGE) The XRP price has been on one of the most shocking, yet impressive journeys in the past month. Despite its legal issue, the XRP price pulled out of its sluggish phase as it priced above its long-standing $0.5 range to hit $2 a few days back. Now, the XRP price is held in a weekly range of $1.46 – $2.82, and it is showing potential to hit $100 in due time. With the XRP possibly approaching the $100 price mark, Dogecoin (DOGE) is also expected to settle around $7, aligning with the momentum of the XRP price. Dogecoin’s (DOGE) price has shown over 150% pump in the past week while receiving positive momentum. Should the XRP price hit $100, it wouldn’t be surprising for Dogecoin (DOGE) to also take a leap to $7 from its current $0.4 price mark. Either way, investors are closely watching the XRP price as it maintains bullishness. Conclusion While XRP appears to be on a bullish run, its projected price target of $100 seems highly improbable compared to WallitIQ (WLTQ) , reaching $5.20. For XRP to hit $100, its market capitalization would need to soar to an unrealistic $5.2 trillion. In contrast, WallitIQ’s strategic positioning in the AI market and its SolidProof- audited smart contract will attract significant traction, potentially rallying its price by 30,000%. The WallitIQ (WLTQ) token is currently going for a low price of $0.0243. However, it won’t stay at this price for long. The platform is set for another price shift to $0.0420 in stage 3, giving investors a remarkable 72% profit. So, Invest in WallitIQ (WLTQ) now while it’s still in presale. According to analysts, with its one-of-a-kind features and immense growth potential, the value of WLTQ tokens is sure to surge by an impressive 30,000% and hit $5.2.

37485023,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51856,1733878522,"RLUSD Wins Regulatory Approval, Ripple CEO Confirms. Here’s What Is Next","Ripple has achieved a significant milestone as the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) granted final approval for its stablecoin RLUSD. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced the development via Twitter, confirming that exchange and partner listings for RLUSD would soon be available. He further emphasized that updates regarding the stablecoin’s launch will be communicated directly through Ripple’s official channels. The approval marks a pivotal step for Ripple. It positions RLUSD to make a meaningful impact in the growing stablecoin market. Stablecoins, digital assets pegged to stable financial instruments such as fiat currencies, are gaining traction as a transformative force in the payments sector. Ripple’s RLUSD aims to capitalize on this trend by offering a secure, regulated, and scalable solution for businesses and consumers. Ripple’s Vision for RLUSD In a recent interview with CNBC, Ripple President Monica Long highlighted the company’s ambitions for RLUSD . Long described the stablecoin market as a high-growth sector with significant potential. Currently valued at approximately $1 billion, the global stablecoin market is projected to exceed $3 trillion in the coming years. Long attributed this anticipated expansion to the increasing adoption of stablecoins for payments and cross-border transactions. Long also emphasized the critical role of regulatory compliance in ensuring the success and stability of RLUSD. Ripple’s collaboration with the NYDFS to finalize its trust application underscores its commitment to adhering to regulatory standards. According to Long, regulatory clarity is essential for fostering trust and broader adoption of stablecoins in the financial ecosystem. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Reaction and Implications The announcement of NYDFS approval for RLUSD has generated significant market excitement. Ripple’s native cryptocurrency, XRP, saw a 6.72% increase in value, trading at $2.37 within the last 24 hours. This uptick reflects growing investor confidence in Ripple’s ability to innovate and expand its influence in the digital payments space. RLUSD’s launch is expected to enhance Ripple’s product offerings, particularly in its enterprise-focused payment solutions. By providing a stable and regulated digital asset, Ripple aims to streamline cross-border transactions, reduce costs, and improve efficiency for businesses worldwide. Additionally, the RLUSD launch could bolster Ripple’s competitive edge against other stablecoins, such as Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), by leveraging its regulatory approval and reputation for transparency. Broader Industry Impact The approval of RLUSD by a stringent regulatory authority like the NYDFS sets a benchmark for the stablecoin industry. It demonstrates the importance of proactive engagement with regulators and adherence to compliance requirements in launching digital financial products. Ripple’s approach could be a model for other blockchain companies aiming to integrate stablecoins into the broader financial system.

Amid this correction, bearish tendencies among investors on Binance have surfaced. A recent analysis by CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost highlights a significant trend where Binance’s taker buy-sell ratio for Ethereum turned “sharply negative” at the $4,000 mark. This suggests that traders on the exchange have predominantly adopted a selling stance. Related Reading: Sell Pressure Rises As Ethereum Tests $4,000 Resistance—What’s Next For ETH? Ethereum Tug of War According to Darkfost, the bearish sentiment on Binance has persisted since the start of November, coinciding with Ethereum’s approach to this critical resistance level. The analyst pointed out that while this bearish sentiment could typically signal a potential reversal, Ethereum’s price movement has defied seeing high bearish inclination, driven by other influential factors. Notably, demand for Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) has surged, showcasing a growing institutional interest that continues to support Ethereum’s price action. The surge in demand for Ethereum ETFs signals a shift in market stance where institutional players increasingly influence price movements. Institutional interest, evidenced by consistent inflows into Ethereum-focused investment products seems to have been pivotal in offsetting the selling pressure observed among retail traders on Binance. ETH Market Performance And Outlook So far, Ethereum has seen a significant correction in its price decreasing to as low as $3,616 as of today. At the time of writing, the asset currently trades at a price of $3,621 down by nearly 6% in the past day. Notably, this price performance has unsurprisingly dropped the asset’s market cap by over $40 billion, falling from over $490 billion seen last week Friday to $434 billion today. Interestingly, despite this price decrease, Ethereum’s daily trading volume has seen an opposite trend rising from below $60 billion on December 6 to now at $72 billion. Given the current market condition, it is likely that the increase in ETH’s volume is coming from sell-offs. Related Reading: Ethereum Funding Rates Hit Multi-Month Highs, But Is A Correction On The Horizon? According to data from Coinglass, in the past 24 hours , 526,828 traders were liquidated with the total liquidations coming in at $1.58 billion. Out of this total liquidations, ETH accounts for roughly $234.72 million. Long liquidations dominates reaching $208.83 million. Short traders also had their share losses registering $25.89 million worth of ETH liquidations.

This decision follows a plea agreement between former CEO Alex Mashinsky and United States prosecutors. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams requested the Southern District of New York’s District Court to delay Cohen-Pavon’s sentencing until after Mashinsky’s, which is set for April 2025. Williams highlighted that Cohen-Pavon’s testimony and shared information could significantly determine Mashinsky’s sentence. Judge John Koeltl approved the request, officially postponing the sentencing hearing. While granting the request, Judge Koeltl ordered both parties to report to the court on April 18 for an update. This will be ten days after Mashinky’s sentencing. The judge will likely make a sentencing to Cohen-Pavon on this date. Cohen-Pavon had earlier pleaded guilty to four counts of felony charges. Mashinsky’s agreement to plead guilty changed the proceedings While everything seemed to have fallen into place for Cohen-Pavon, Mashinsky’s agreement to plead guilty has altered the flow. On December 3, Mashinsky agreed to plead guilty to two charges as part of a deal with prosecutors. If the Judge gives a maximum sentence to the two charges, Mashinsky could spend up to 30 years in prison on both charges served consecutively. Cohen-Pavon and Mashinsky were indicted in July 2023. They were accused of misleading Celsius users to maximize profits by manipulating prices. When the two were indicted, Cohen-Pavon was not in the US, and he had pleaded not guilty by then. However, when he was finally arrested in September 2023, he pleaded guilty to several charges. Among the listed charges were conspiracy to commit price manipulation, wire fraud, manipulation of security prices, and securities fraud. Despite pleading guilty to these charges, Cohen-Pavon had never been sentenced, as he was scheduled for sentencing on December 11. Cohen-Pavon might Influence Mashinky’s sentencing Most people following the case wonder how Cohen-Pavon’s information to the court could sway the Judge’s consideration during Mashinsky’s sentencing. The former CEO pleaded guilty to misinforming users about Celsius’s approval from US regulators and not selling his CEL token holdings. As part of his plea deal, he was open to forfeiting $48 million in proceeds from the scheme. While awaiting his sentencing, Cohen-Pavon has been enjoying foreign travels freely. He was allowed to return to Israel from New York after posting a bond worth $500,000. Judge Koeltl also allowed him to travel to Singapore in September. The period coincided with the Token 2049 crypto conference in Singapore, leading to speculations of his attendance. Celsius went bankrupt in 2022. By then, it was a top crypto platform that had collapsed due to a market downturn. Most users lost their money locked in their accounts, leaving them in anguish. The investors were relieved in November when a Bankruptcy judge approved a reorganization plan for Celsius, making it possible for debtors to distribute about $2 billion to the platform’s creditors. The company indicated that they will begin repaying customers by next year. While the Celsius case is still active, these executives won’t be the first to face jail time in the crypto space. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried went through the legal process and was jailed. Besides, former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao served his term in prison. The two were facing different charges.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Altcoins, including DOGEN, could be primed for massive growth, with predictions of up to 5,000% gains by Christmas. Table of Contents DOGEN: An alpha meme token capturing the crypto scene Cardano to soar as altseason approaches Avalanche eyes $62 resistance Polkadot on the brink of major breakout Kaspa: Potential surge above $0.22 resistance Conclusion While Bitcoin and Ethereum grab most of the spotlight, some overlooked cryptocurrencies are showing immense potential. These five select altcoins are poised for massive growth, with predictions of high values by Christmas. DOGEN: An alpha meme token capturing the crypto scene DOGE, SHIB, and FLOKI — the real alpha is here, DOGEN. Built for the strongest, boldest, and most fearless holders, DOGEN is the ultimate meme token for taking over the market. It’s not for the faint-hearted — it’s for those with the guts to chase greatness and the drive to win big. Frogs can leap away because DOGEN is here with the intention to rule. This Solana-powered beast has advanced from day one, with a 700% surge expected in the coming months. DOGEN also aims for thousand-fold gains that will redefine what meme tokens can achieve. Notably, DOGEN rewards its hardcore believers with an exclusive airdrop. Joining in is simple: Flex social media game, grab tokens during the presale, and recruit new members to the DOGEN army with a referral link. Every recruit earns their recruiter 20% of the golden points from the token buys. DOGEN’s referral system is as alpha as it gets. Investors also earn 7% from every token their direct recruits (1st level) buy using their referral code. As such, the more recruits, the bigger the rewards. As the altseason approaches, DOGEN holders could be among the ones leading the charge. DOGE is set to be a ticket to an exclusive community of winners to will enjoy luxurious campaigns, killer perks, and the best deals in the game. DOGEN is more than a token — it’s a lifestyle. Posh cars, stacks of cash, and unforgettable experiences are just the beginning for DOGEN holders who refuse to settle for less. Interested investors can join the DOGEN presale to flex hard and potentially earn big . Cardano to soar as altseason approaches Cardano currently trades between $1.06 and $1.33, showing stability despite a slight 0.43% drop over the past week. Impressively, it has surged over 157% in the last month and more than 171% over six months, reflecting strong upward momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is around 34, nearing oversold territory, which hints at a possible upward swing. If ADA breaks past the nearest resistance at $1.46, it could aim for the next target at $1.73, marking a substantial increase from current levels. With the altcoin season on the horizon and bullish market sentiments rising, ADA has significant potential to climb higher. Avalanche eyes $62 resistance Avalanche is moving within the $47-$58 range, with a 76% gain over the past month. The token’s price is nearing the resistance level at $62. A break above this could see it reach the next resistance at $73, representing a significant increase from current prices. The 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are both around $52, indicating a period of consolidation. The RSI is below 40, suggesting the coin is not overbought. With a low stochastic value, there is potential for further upside movement. The MACD is nearly flat, hinting at a possible trend reversal. AVAX may be set for a breakout as the altcoin market gains strength. You might also like: Dogen poised to overtake Dogecoin: 5,000% rally anticipated as whales join the frenzy Polkadot on the brink of major breakout The Polkadot price has shown impressive growth over the past month, surging by over 125%. The coin is currently trading in the range of $8.66 to $11.90, with strong potential to test the nearest resistance level at $13.40. Polkadot’s RSI and Stochastic indicators are in oversold regions, suggesting a bullish reversal soon. If the token breaks through this resistance, it could aim for the next level at $16.64, marking significant gains from current prices. With the anticipation of an altcoin season and a global crypto bull run, Polkadot stands poised for substantial growth in the near future. Kaspa: Potential surge above $0.22 resistance Kaspa is showing strong signs of growth. In the past month, its price has increased by over 61%. The current price range hovers between $0.16 and $0.20, sitting above the 100-day simple moving average of $0.17. The RSI at 44.86 suggests the coin is not overbought. With the nearest resistance level at $0.22, a breakout above this could see the price target the next resistance at $0.26. This would represent a potential gain of over 30% from current levels, with the bullish momentum supported by a 6.8% rise over the past week.. Conclusion Although ADA, AVAX, DOT, and KAS may have limited short-term potential, DOGEN emerges as a standout, designed for those who seek the best in life. Inspired by successful predecessors, it aims to build a community of leaders and offer real benefits, including exclusive campaigns and perks for early adopters.

It’s a little like turning a meme into a serious investment strategy—a perfect combination of internet culture, community vibes, and lucrative returns. The beauty of meme coins lies in their volatility, their cultural relevance, and the potential for sky-high returns if you get in early. Today, we’re focusing on some of the hottest options in the meme coin world: BTFD Coin, Notcoin, and Book of Meme. These are the names driving buzz, excitement, and opportunities for massive returns as we step into the upcoming year. But what’s especially exciting is BTFD Coin’s presale performance , which has been nothing short of phenomenal. The project recently raised a staggering $2.8 million in record time, proving its appeal among retail investors and crypto enthusiasts. Since its presale launch, over 45 billion BTFD Coins have already been sold, and its community—dubbed the Bulls Squad—continues to grow rapidly with more than 4,200 members already invested. With this kind of momentum, BTFD Coin could very well lead the pack when it comes to the best meme coins for significant returns. Ready to explore these meme coin powerhouses? Let’s dive into each one and discover their unique charm, potential growth opportunities, and why they could soon make you the next crypto success story. BTFD Coin: The Presale Phenomenon with Serious Momentum BTFD Coin is undoubtedly riding the wave with its incredibly strong presale numbers and loyal community backing. With its ethos based on “Buy The Dip” (BTFD) and the belief in embracing market opportunities at their lowest points, this meme coin is as much a movement as it is a token. The energy behind BTFD Coin is electric. This isn’t just another meme coin floating in the wind—it has a roadmap, a community-focused ethos, and massive utility potential. From staking rewards (offering up to 90% APY) to its exciting P2E game features , BTFD Coin is setting itself up for long-term sustainability and profitability. Now let’s talk about strategy. If you were to invest $40,000 into BTFD Coin during this presale, your returns could potentially be astronomical. Here’s how: Tokens purchased at the current price: 400,000,000 BTFD tokens (based on $0.0001 per token) Expected price in 2025 (predictions suggest $0.0006): 400,000,000 tokens x $0.0006 = $240,000 Imagine turning $40,000 into $240,000. That’s the kind of ROI that would make even the most seasoned investors sit up and take notice. With this kind of growth trajectory and strong backing, BTFD Coin deserves your attention as one of the best meme coins for significant returns. The bottom line? This presale has the hype, the stats, and the community behind it. If you’re looking to position yourself in a rising meme economy, BTFD Coin is your best bet. Notcoin: Poised for Growth in the Meme Space Next up is Notcoin, a rising star that has steadily gained traction thanks to its unique position and investor support. Notcoin has proven to be a fascinating blend of meme culture, utility, and investor enthusiasm. It’s all about leveraging engagement in a way that’s entirely community-driven and innovative. Currently priced at $0.007744, Notcoin has been steadily climbing, with analysts projecting that it will maintain this bullish trend through early 2025. Some estimates place its potential price at $0.020672 by the end of 2025, signalling massive upside potential for long-term holders. What’s exciting about Notcoin is its approach to decentralised finance through gamified user interaction. You can think of Notcoin as the currency that merges meme appeal with utility, gamification, and community-driven projects—a perfect reflection of today’s DeFi trends. Book of Meme: Meme Culture Meets Binance for a Bright Future Let’s not overlook Book of Meme, another strong contender for the best meme coins for significant returns. This unique project combines meme culture with blockchain innovation by capturing the essence of internet humour and decentralised finance. Its recent debut on Binance only highlights its legitimacy and the growing demand for meme-based tokens that bridge online culture and crypto utility. Book of Meme operates as a way to reward the memes that drive virality and engagement online. Investors, meme lovers, and DeFi enthusiasts are already flocking to its ecosystem, thanks to its clever design, its adaptability, and its goal of incentivising meme creation and sharing. Since being listed on Binance, it’s been going up and down, reaching $0.020672 today. What’s more, it’s expected to rise to $0.022737 by next year’s end. But if that isn’t satisfactory, long-term holders can expect greater returns by 2030, with the price reaching an estimated $0.033332. Final Thoughts: These Meme Coins Are the Real Deal The meme coin market is electric, filled with volatility but offering exciting opportunities. If you’re aiming for best meme coins for significant returns, BTFD Coin, Notcoin, and Book of Meme represent the top contenders. BTFD Coin continues to show remarkable presale numbers with over $2.8 million raised, while Notcoin is innovating with gamification and meme-driven utility. On the other hand, Book of Meme’s Binance debut further solidifies its position in the meme economy. With opportunities like these, it’s all about timing, strategy, and FOMO. If you haven’t already considered BTFD Coin, you should. Its presale is still going strong, and the potential to turn a small investment into massive returns has never looked better.

Crypto King Musk (MUSKKING), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKKING is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Crypto King Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crypto King Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Crypto King Musk launched with over $7,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Crypto King Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Crypto King Musk by entering its contract address – v2jWiNpR1m8gHARdM39GosZ8muaxZpowpBgWgWTSCev – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKKING.

From Dogecoin’s meteoric rise to Shiba Inu’s staggering community growth, these tokens have proven they’re more than just punchlines—they’re opportunities. Now, the next wave of meme coins is gearing up to dominate in 2025, and one name, BTFD Coin , is already stealing the spotlight. Why? With its P2E (play-to-earn) game, staking rewards, and a rapidly expanding community, BTFD isn’t just another meme coin. It’s here to redefine the space. The buzz surrounding BTFD Coin is off the charts, especially after its presale went live on November 26, 2024. Investors flocked to grab a piece of this rising star, pushing the project through 25% of its presale stages in just 24 hours. Now in Stage 10 and priced at $0.0001, BTFD Coin has already raised over $2.8 million, with 4,200 holders and more than 45 billion tokens sold. Analysts are predicting explosive growth, making this presale one of the most talked-about events in crypto right now. But what makes BTFD Coin one of the best meme coins to buy for 2025? And how do Popcat and Turbo fit into this evolving meme coin narrative? Let’s break it down, starting with the hottest meme token of the year— BTFD Coin. BTFD Coin: The Future King of Meme Coins BTFD Coin (short for “Buy The Freakin’ Dip”) has taken the crypto scene by storm. Unlike most meme coins, which rely heavily on hype and community buzz, BTFD brings real utility to the table. Its play-to-earn (P2E) game is designed to keep users engaged while earning rewards in $BTFD tokens, creating a sustainable ecosystem. Plus, with staking rewards on offer, holders have every reason to HODL their tokens and watch their investments grow. Let’s talk numbers. BTFD Coin’s presale began at $0.000004 per token, and once it’s listed at $0.0006, early investors could see a jaw-dropping 15,000% return. For example, if you had invested $8,000 in Stage 5, where $BTFD was priced at $0.00005, you would’ve snagged 160 million tokens. At the listing price, those tokens would be worth $96,000. That’s a life-changing gain right there. The presale performance alone speaks volumes about the project’s potential. Within just 14 days, it smashed through the $2.5 million mark, and it’s now sitting comfortably at over $2.8 million. The community? Over 4,200 strong and growing daily. With only six stages left in the presale, FOMO (fear of missing out) is real, and for good reason. Analysts are already predicting a surge in $BTFD’s price post-listing, with some speculating it could hit $0.002 or higher by mid-2025. If you’re looking for one of the best meme coins to buy for 2025, this is it. The presale is your golden ticket. Don’t sleep on it. Popcat: The Internet Sensation Turned Crypto Star Popcat, inspired by the viral internet meme of a cat “popping” its mouth, is another meme coin making waves. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, Popcat combines meme culture with innovative tokenomics to reward its holders. What sets Popcat apart is its community-driven approach. Every time a user interacts with the Popcat game or spreads the meme online, they earn $POP tokens. It’s like mining, but with memes. Popcat has also been gaining traction for its charitable initiatives. A portion of every transaction fee goes towards animal welfare organisations, which has endeared it to socially conscious investors. And let’s face it—who doesn’t love a good cause? From an investment perspective, Popcat has shown steady growth since its launch. Its initial price of $0.00001 has risen to $0.00008, with analysts forecasting it could hit $0.0005 by the end of 2025. While it doesn’t boast the same explosive presale performance as BTFD Coin, its loyal community and unique use case make it a solid contender. So, should you add Popcat to your portfolio? If you’re all about supporting projects with heart and believe in the power of internet culture, then yes. It’s one of the best meme coins to buy for 2025, especially if you’re in it for the long haul. Turbo: The Speed Demon of Meme Coins Turbo is all about speed—both in its transactions and its rise to fame. Launched as a decentralised meme coin on the Binance Smart Chain, Turbo aims to be the go-to token for quick and cheap transactions. Its ultra-fast blockchain technology and near-zero gas fees make it an attractive option for traders looking to move funds without breaking the bank. What makes Turbo one of the best meme coins to buy for 2025? It’s all in the branding. Turbo has managed to build a reputation as the “speedy meme coin,” and it’s doubling down with strategic partnerships in the gaming and eSports sectors. Gamers can now use $TURBO tokens to purchase in-game assets or participate in tournaments, further integrating the coin into a massive and lucrative market. Since its launch, Turbo has grown its market cap to over $15 million, and its token price has climbed from $0.00002 to $0.00015. While it’s still early days, Turbo’s focus on real-world utility and its thriving gaming partnerships make it a strong contender in the meme coin space. If you’re someone who loves the thrill of fast-paced investments, Turbo might just be your jam. It’s got the potential for big gains, especially as its use case expands in the gaming industry. Conclusion: Secure Your Spot in the Meme Coin Revolution Based on our research and market trends, it’s clear that the meme coin space is evolving faster than ever. BTFD Coin, with its presale performance and groundbreaking features, is leading the charge, while Popcat and Turbo bring their own unique strengths to the table. If you’re serious about future-proofing your portfolio, now’s the time to act. The BTFD Coin presale is still ongoing, but it’s already in Stage 10, with prices set to rise as it approaches its final stages. Don’t miss your chance to get in early and ride the wave of one of the best meme coins to buy for 2025. Join the BTFD Coin presale now and be part of the next big thing in crypto.

37483432,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51854,1733875226,Shiba Inu Lead Dev Explains Purpose and Impact of Burns to SHIB Price,"Shytoshi Kusama, the anonymous lead developer of Shiba Inu , recently addressed widespread misconceptions within the community regarding the importance of token burns to SHIB’s success. The statement came in response to ongoing debates about the role of burns in driving demand for the token. Community Divided Over Token Burns The discussion was raised when the 1 Cent Dream project announced the completion of its second burn campaign of 250 million SHIB tokens. This initiative aimed to decrease the circulating supply and urged the community to participate in future burn events. While some praised the effort, others criticized Kusama and the team for not implementing more significant burns. A notable comment came from a community member, Gunz0369 , who argued that increased burns are essential for attracting new investors and ensuring the asset’s future growth. Kusama’s Response Kusama countered these claims, arguing that Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) recent success proves its performance is not solely reliant on burns. He noted that despite limited burn activity, the token has achieved a remarkable 192% price increase year-to-date, currently trading at $0.00002986. According to Kusama, focusing exclusively on burns overshadows the broader factors contributing to the token’s growth. He emphasized that the token’s ecosystem, including utility, governance, and strategic partnerships, has been instrumental in driving success. Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s Layer 2 blockchain, is a key part of this ecosystem and has boosted sentiment and adoption. Kusama also pointed out that expanding the asset’s use cases and completing ecosystem projects will naturally lead to more burn opportunities. By attracting new users and increasing utility, the token’s circulating supply can be reduced effectively over time. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Shibarium’s Role in the Ecosystem Shibarium has sparked debate within the community regarding its impact on token burns. While some users highlighted its contribution to Shiba Inu’s growth, others questioned its effectiveness in reducing supply. Critics argued that Shibarium relies on the token’s success rather than the other way around. Kusama addressed these concerns by explaining that Shibarium is part of a comprehensive strategy to strengthen the ecosystem. Since its launch, Shibarium has facilitated the burning of over 56 billion SHIB through gas fee allocations. Additionally, the burn portal introduced as part of Shibarium has automatically removed more than 300 million SHIB from circulation. Despite these contributions, Kusama emphasized that no single factor, including Shibarium, can be credited for the asset’s overall success. He reiterated that growth stems from the combined marketing, partnerships, and community engagement efforts. SHIB Burn Statistics Since SHIB’s inception in August 2020, over 410.74 trillion tokens have been burned, significantly reducing its initial supply. However, Kusama and other developers focus on long-term strategies rather than relying solely on token incineration. The lead developer encouraged the community to adopt a balanced perspective, recognizing the importance of innovation, utility, and partnerships in driving the token’s value. While token burns remain a topic of interest for supporters, Kusama’s statement underscores the importance of a multifaceted approach to achieving long-term success. By focusing on utility, strategic partnerships, and ecosystem expansion, the asset claims to sustain its growth and enhance its position in the cryptocurrency market.

Dogecoin (DOGE) is still the meme coin king and Dogwifhat (WIF) is establishing itself in the Solana ecosystem. However, a shift is happening with DTX Exchange (DTX), a hybrid utility token breaking records and hitting $9.99 million in presale, and it is looking good for the crypto space. Dogwifhat (WIF) Stays Strong Despite Market Volatility Dogwifhat (WIF) on the Solana blockchain is a serious meme coin contender. Despite a $5 million liquidation event that spooked the market, WIF is up 39% in the last month and getting a lot of attention from investors. WIF has gotten attention because of the price, the community, and marketing. The WIF community has been promoting the token through viral memes and grassroots campaigns on Twitter and Reddit and getting more engagement and visibility. WIF being on the Solana blockchain makes it a low-fee high-speed alternative to other meme coins for traders frustrated with Ethereum-based networks’ congestion. With community events and potential partnerships teased by the devs, WIF’s ecosystem can grow more and WIF will be a serious player in the memecoin space. The chart shows a descending triangle with mixed short-term momentum. But the $3 support has been getting bought in. If it breaks above $4.83, it could be a bullish breakout, and WIF could go to new all-time highs. Source: CoinMarketCap Dogecoin (DOGE) Still Rules the Crypto World The crypto community still loves Dogecoin (DOGE), the original meme coin. Global brands accept DOGE as a payment method, and Elon Musk supports it. In the last month, DOGE has doubled, 391%, since the beginning of the year. On the technical side, an ascending triangle pattern suggests DOGE could rise 18% in the next few weeks to $0.58. Also, whale activity has increased, and big investors recently bought $276 million worth of DOGE, which indicates that they believe in its growth. Source: CoinMarketCap DTX Exchange (DTX): A New Era in Utility Token Investments While meme coins like DOGE and WIF are making headlines, DTX Exchange is changing the game with crypto utility and adoption. Unlike meme coins, DTX is focused on utility-driven innovation, a platform that combines crypto, forex, and stock trading all in one user-friendly ecosystem. DTX Exchange has raised a whopping $9,99 million in presale, and it’s above 50% of the 6th stage. The current token price is $0.12, 7th stage will increase to $0.14. So DTX is not only a proof of demand but also a game changer in the blockchain space. DTX token success is driven by its robust features, Phoenix Wallet for decentralized asset custody, and VulcanX blockchain for high-leverage trading on 100,000+ financial instruments. These features create a unified trading experience for retail and institutional investors. DTX Exchange has an active community of over 160,000 members who are part of the development process. Through governance rights and profit sharing DTX creates a collaborative environment. Also, SolidProof audited the project to give investors more confidence. Memecoins and Utility-Driven Tokens The crypto space is changing, and meme coins like DOGE and WIF are doing well, along with utility tokens like DTX. Memecoins rely on community and market hype, while hybrid tokens like DTX are carving out space by offering real use cases and sustainable growth. DTX Exchange (DTX) is an example of this with its record-breaking presale and solutions; for investors looking for the next big thing in crypto, DTX is positioning itself to be the leader.
