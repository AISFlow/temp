Today $1 equals 45,000,000,000,000,000 bolivars -although it has been devalued to look like 4,5 VES-, a cipher too large to comprehend, much like the general panorama. The basic food basket is calculated over $300 a month, but the minimum wage is roughly $7, and last year many doctors were making as much a $15 a month. Financial Times published a report where they describe the methods used by the interim president to bypass the Maduro regime&apos;s tight grip that would not allow citizens to receive any type of external aid. As Gideon Long&apos;s report remembers, the U.S. sanctions on Venezuela had made the situation worse for its citizens with the state funds frozen in U.S bank accounts, but the politicians who oppose the government -with Guaidó recognized by Washington as Venezuela&apos;s legitimate president- found leverage in that by managing to access the accounts after convincing the US Treasury of doing so. But how would they get the money to the health carers&apos; hands if the government was extremely against it?

The hacker used a compromised API key that was created without the knowledge or authorization of Badger engineers to periodically inject the malicious code that affected a subset of its customers.  The hacker ultimately stole $130 million in funds, but approximately $9 million of that was recoverable since those funds were transferred by the hacker but not yet withdrawn from Badger’s vaults.  Badger has since patched the Cloudflare exploit, updated Cloudfare’s account password and deleted or freshened API keys where possible.

The case had dragged on for about a year and finally came to an end with this judgment. This time, Wright did not appeal the judgment as the computer scientist believed it to be fair. Furthermore, Wright said that the judgment on the part of the court solidifies his claim to be the original Bitcoin creator, which is something the computer scientist has claimed for a long time. Wright was ordered to pay the $100 million to the heirs of David Kleiman who claimed the late computer scientist&apos;s estate was entitled to half of the 1.1 million BTC mined by Satoshi Nakamoto.

The bitcoins contained in this wallet are worth an estimated $70 billion, of which Kleiman&apos;s heirs claimed to be entitled to half of this.

42396366,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT2rEr,1639176461,Market Wrap: US Inflation at 39-Year High Fails to Buoy Bitcoin,"Bitcoin’s price swung from gains to losses and back to gains on Friday after a key U.S. inflation report showed consumer prices rose in November at their fastest pace in 39 years.  The market fluctuations left bitcoin on track for its fourth straight weekly decline, and the starry-eyed forecasts of $100,000 by year end – or even a return to last month’s all-time high of around $69,000 – are now looking far less likely.  Crypto traders had been waiting for the release of the U.S. consumer price index early Friday, because many investors see bitcoin as a potentially useful hedge against inflation. The CPI report showed that the index for all items rose 6.8% in the 12 months through November, the highest level since May 1982, when it was 6.9%. The cost-of-living increase was in line with the average forecast of economists in a Reuters survey and was higher than October’s 6.2% increase.  Bitcoin climbed past $50,000 after the 8:30 a.m. ET (13:40 UTC) report, but quickly ceded those gains to trade in the red as analysts leapt to the logical conclusion – that the high inflation rate might provide ample motivation for the Federal Reserve to decide to accelerate its withdrawal of monetary stimulus at its meeting next week – the last scheduled gathering of 2021 for the U.S. central bank’s monetary policy committee.  “If financial markets grow nervous, the Fed may have an aggressive tightening cycle, and the first thing that gets sold is your top-performing assets and that would be cryptos for many traders,” Edward Moya, a senior markets analyst at the foreign-exchange brokerage Oanda, told CoinDesk’s Lyllah Ledesma.  By later in the day, though, bitcoin had turned up along with traditional markets as traders noted that the inflation number wasn’t as high as some economists had warned.  Latest Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $48,383, +1.3%  Ether (ETH): $4,046, -2.0%  S&P 500: +1.0%  Gold: $1,782, +0.4%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.489%  With bitcoin down for four straight weeks, crypto market analysts are starting to discount the likelihood of a powerful end-of-year rally similar to the 2020 moonshot.  “We may not see heavy risk taking by institutional investors in the last weeks of December for tactical reasons,” research analysts for Coinbase Institutional wrote Friday in a weekly newsletter. “As a result, cryptocurrencies may be range-bound for the remainder of December in our view.”  Traders of the Constitution  Crypto traders betting on the recently famous ConstitutionDAO’s PEOPLE tokens recorded over $9 million in liquidations on Friday, data from analytics tool Coinglass shows.  The plunge followed a broader decline in crypto markets that saw large-cap altcoins like solana, terra and uniswap fall by as much as 9% as of Friday morning.  Some 17,000 participants in the ConstitutionDAO raised $40 million in November to purchase a copy of the U.S. Constitution – in what was one of the largest such collective efforts involving cryptocurrencies.  The collective lost out to Ken Griffin – the founder of the Citadel hedge fund who snapped up the piece with a winning bid of $43 million, reportedly because his son told him to. ConstitutionDAO participants were later refunded their donated funds in the form of PEOPLE.  PEOPLE has no utility and offers no governance rights to holders. But that didn’t stop crypto traders from pushing the token to a market cap of $839 million, according to CoinMarketCap. And the trading frenzy is leading to losses, CoinDesk’s Shaurya Malwa reported.

42394340,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvc8Yf,1639176363,Why Is Bitcoin Dropping if It’s an ‘Inflation Hedge’?,"This morning, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released updated numbers for its inflation-tracking Consumer Price Index (CPI), showing U.S. inflation has hit a 6.8% annualized rate. That adds up to the highest year-over-year inflation rate since 1982, which is decidedly not great. Among other implications, the number is another nail in the coffin of U.S. President Joe Biden’s “Build Back Better” social spending package.  And asset markets? Wall Street had already priced in 6.7% inflation, so the Dow Jones Industrial Average has been pretty much stable as of this writing. Gold saw a modest but noticeable morning bump, while gold futures have seen a choppy but decent runup over the last six months as inflation fears gestated.  Bitcoin, meanwhile, was flat to down this morning, and down more than 25% over the past 30 days. That contradicts one of the most widely cited selling points of bitcoin – that it’s an “inflation hedge,” a place to put your money when fiat is losing real-world value.  So what gives? Why isn’t bitcoin rallying as inflation in the world’s biggest economy touches 40-year highs?  Here’s the secret that your average YouTube crypto shillfluencer will pretty much never spill: The idea that bitcoin is an inflation hedge is purely speculative. It’s compelling, and it may become true in the future, and it may be a rational reason to speculate on bitcoin right now. But it’s not a mechanism that actually functions in the present day.  It certainly seems very structurally plausible that it eventually will if bitcoin adoption continues on its current path. If enough companies, economies and individuals transfer a lot of their wealth into bitcoin, its price will become more stable, making its steady and tight issuance policy much more appealing, and reducing the risk of rotating into it when inflation is running hot.  That’s how some people use gold, which is why bitcoin is sometimes referred to as “digital gold.” Investor and CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter recently pointed out that if bitcoin were to gain adoption similar to gold, it would mean growing 10x from where we are now. That seems like a quite likely future scenario to me.  But that’s not where we are now. Currently bitcoin prices are unstable for a number of reasons that have no direct tie to inflation, and if recent price moves are any indication, those forces remain considerably more powerful than the “digital gold” narrative.  First and foremost, bitcoin has been on a nearly two-year bull run. The simple mathematics of reversion to the mean and/or the emotional gravity of profit taking made a pullback inevitable. That’s especially true because bitcoin is still quite clearly a speculative asset – its current total valuation of nearly $1 trillion (wow) is based not on current adoption, but on scenarios of future growth. Any speculative asset is particularly vulnerable to uncertainty: Tesla stock, which is now largely a bet on Elon Musk inventing general artificial intelligence, is off roughly as much as bitcoin over the last 30 days.  That points to anxiety over the strength of the real economy, most of it focused outside the U.S. China in particular is beginning to show signs of a looming unwind, which would have serious impacts around the globe. But debt and other forms of leverage (even excluding leverage buried in stock prices) are at record levels basically everywhere.  So things are choppy and could go in a lot of different directions without much notice. A major downward shock would knock a lot of wind out of future-oriented assets, and some investors are de-risking to be on the safe side.  Relative to bitcoin’s inflation thesis, the scenario demonstrates the most inconvenient truth of economics and finance: that it’s very hard to definitively prove why nearly anything happens. There’s almost never a chance for a “controlled experiment,” a situation where only one variable changes at a time, allowing its specific impact to be fully observed. The clearest way to really affirm bitcoin’s role as an inflation hedge would be if nearly nothing but inflation was going on, and that’s just not a situation we’re ever going to see in the real world.  Instead, on any economic or financial question, there are nearly always a large number of moving parts – including elements even professionals may be completely unaware of. Predicting the future depends on picking the right moving parts to focus on. For bitcoin, at least for now, inflation doesn’t seem to be the story the markets are listening to.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,David Z.

PEOPLE has no utility and offers no governance rights to holders. But this hasn’t stopped crypto natives from trading up the token to a fully diluted market cap of $839 million as per CoinMarketCap. And the trading frenzy is leading to losses.  PEOPLE traded as high as $0.15 on crypto exchange OKEx on Friday morning, dropping to as low as $0.09 in mid-London hours before seeing aggressive buying at that price level and recovering to $0.11 at press time.  People trading PEOPLE  The move, however, saw traders lose over $9 million on PEOPLE’s futures product – a financial instrument offered by OKEx that allows traders to bet on prices of the token without holding the physical asset.  Interestingly, both longs and shorts took a hit. Of the approximately $9 million in total liquidations, $4.99 million occurred on “long” positions – or the trades betting on upward price movements on PEOPLE, while the remaining $4.1 million worth occurred on “short” positions, meaning those betting on declining prices of the token.  Liquidations are said to occur when exchanges automatically close out a trading position after asset prices reach a certain value, leading to the initial capital put up by traders getting forfeited. The trade is then said to be “liquidated.”  Liquidations occur predominantly on bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum’s ether (ETH), the most-traded cryptocurrencies, followed by large-cap cryptos like Solana’s SOL and Terra’s LUNA. But Friday saw the PEOPLE tokens – a relative newcomer to such lists – rack up the most losses for traders compared to other altcoins.  How did PEOPLE come into existence?  The Ethereum-based PEOPLE tokens were distributed as a refund mechanism to contributors of ConstitutionDAO, an iconic decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) – a nominally leaderless online investment or organizational collective formed to reach a common goal, in this case, that of purchasing the Constitution.  Participants could either claim or redeem at the equivalent of 1 ether (about $4,200 as per CoinGecko at press time) worth of PEOPLE. The tokens have no intrinsic value, but that didn’t stop a nearly 12,000% price appreciation of the tokens since a low of $0.0009 on Nov. 21.  Meanwhile, ConstitutionDAO has reached a dead end and “has now run its course” as per a note on the project’s website.

42396363,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT2rBu,1639176307,2 Prominent Bitcoin Core Contributors Step Away From Their Roles,"Veteran open-source Bitcoin developer John Newbery announced on Friday he will take a step back from his work, continuing a series of departures involving Bitcoin Core, an implementation of Bitcoin’s software that keeps the global currency running.  Newbery tweeted that he’s taking a break “for some time.” He has left his role as a director of Brink, the independent organization for funding Bitcoin’s developer community that he launched last year. Newbery has also handed over the reins at the Bitcoin Optech newsletter and management of Bitcoin Core’s PR (pull requests).  Bitcoin Core connects to the blockchain and keeps things running, with open-source developers contributing research, peer review, testing and documentation. A small group of project maintainers can directly access Bitcoin’s code.  On Thursday, Bitcoin Core maintainer Samuel Dobson announced he was stepping down to focus on the end of his Ph.D. program. Dobson was a maintainer of the project’s crypto wallet and contributed to the security of the protocol.  Dobson’s departure followed the October exit of Bitcoin Core code maintainer Jonas Schnelli, who cited the stress of increasing legal risks for developers. According to Bitcointalk.org, the maintainers with commit access to Bitcoin’s code currently numbers just three people: Wladimir J. van der Laan, Marco Falke and Michael Ford. There are also two people with commit access who are not maintainers – Pieter Wuille and Hennadii Stepanov. And while there are many Core developers and contributors working on Bitcoin’s code, only maintainers and those with commit access are able to merge new code with the existing Bitcoin Core code.  And earlier this year, van der Laan, who’s listed as a lead maintainer, announced he was taking more of a “background role” on the project to help decentralize it.  When reached by email, Dobson said he felt all the recent departures from the core development team were “just coincidence.”  “There are a lot of regular contributors and people are always coming and going,” Dobson wrote. “I guess it is just a season for some change.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/12/10/2-prominent-bitcoin-core-contributors-step-away-from-their-roles,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d4497bbf5a828091fe39db9e38b092701aee4aeb-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

CoinDesk 20 data shows the cryptocurrency declined 1.5% to $47,900 in the past 24 hours, with prices down 2.25% for the week.  The U.S. consumer price index (CPI) report scheduled for release at 13:30 UTC is forecast to show the cost of living in the world’s largest economy increased at an annualized 6.8% in November, following October’s 6.2% print, according to FXStreet.  “We expect headline inflation to push towards the 7% level, and to fall close to consensus expectations (currently at 6.8%),” ING analysts said in a blog post.  The data is likely to inject volatility into the crypto market, trader and analyst Alex Kruger tweeted.  That’s what happened last month.

A somewhat similar action might unfold later Friday if the data beats estimates, paving the way for the Fed to accelerate the taper in December and forcing markets to price in a higher probability of an early interest rate hike. As of now, money markets see a roughly 40% probability of the Fed raising rates by 25 basis points to a 0.25%-0.5% window in March 2022.  The continued uptick in the two-year Treasury yield, which is more sensitive to inflation expectations and rate-hike bets than the 10-year yield, suggests the market is pricing in faster Fed rate increases before the release. The two-year yield has risen to 0.73%, the highest since March 2020.  A weaker-than-expected report may provide some relief to asset prices, although it could be temporary. That’s because, according to ING, “inflation would need to drop quite sharply before the market can reasonably price out the Fed tightening cycle in 2022.”  The data has become increasingly important, with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell recently saying it is probably time to retire the word “transitory” when describing inflation. Furthermore, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) urged the Fed to tighten policy amid mounting inflation concerns.  These developments have perhaps challenged the popular narrative that the central bank may refrain from doing anything that will destabilize the market even at the cost of high inflation.  Bitcoin and tech cycle  Bitcoin’s vulnerability to rate-rise concerns likely stems from its appeal as an evolving technology. Historically, the cryptocurrency has closely tracked movements in tech stocks, which are sensitive to monetary policy tightening.  The above chart provided by Ilan Solot, a global market strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman, shows a strong correlation between the tech cycle, as measured by the ratio of the Nasdaq index to the S&P 500, and bitcoin.  A rising ratio, shown by the red line, means tech stocks are outperforming the broader equity market, typically a boom time for bitcoin and crypto markets.  “Like any financial asset, crypto will suffer from broad market moves. But in particular, crypto (proxied by bitcoin) this year seems to do better during periods when tech is outperforming,” Solot said in an email. “We can see this using a ratio of Nasdaq/S&P 500. This correlation may be driven by some overlap of the investor base, or simply because both assets tend to be higher beta.” Beta is a measure of the extent to which an asset moves in line with the broader market.  “But whatever the case, we suspect this correlation will loosen eventually, especially for non-BTC cryptocurrencies,” Solot said.  For now, however, bitcoin’s fortunes appear tied to tech stocks, which have begun underperforming the broader market amid strengthening bets on a Fed rate increase.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/10/bitcoin-under-pressure-two-year-treasury-yield-rises-to-21-month-high-as-us-inflation-report-looms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3ac69c650cb88efaebdacd1888525aae0d75d9d4-1000x665.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42396357,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT2r6z,1639176248,US Inflation Jumps to 39-Year High of 6.8% in November; Bitcoin Falls,"The U.S. Labor Department’s Consumer Price Index (CPI), closely tracked by bitcoin traders due to the cryptocurrency’s use by some investors as a hedge against inflation, has risen to its highest since the early 1980s.  The CPI for all items rose 6.8% in the 12 months through November, the highest since May 1982, when it was 6.9%. The cost-of-living increase was in line with the average forecast of economists in a Reuters survey, but it marked a sharp increase from October’s 6.2% print.  Stripping away the volatile food and energy component, the CPI core reading for November was 4.9%, more than double the Federal Reserve’s stated target of 2%.  Bitcoin rose 2% in the minutes after the CPI data was released, trading around $50,000. But within the a few hours, the price had dropped to below the $48,000 level.  Crypto traders may see the high inflation rate as additional motivation for the Federal Reserve to accelerate its withdrawal of monetary stimulus. At a meeting last month, the U.S. central bank announced plans to start tapering its $120 billion-a-month of bond purchases – a form of stimulus, funded by money printing, designed to help markets and the economy heal from the impact of the coronavirus.  Next week, the Fed is expected to double the pace of the tapering to wind down the bond purchases by March, sooner than the current trajectory of mid-2022. Less monetary stimulus might be bad for bitcoin, since the cryptocurrency’s price has been buoyed in the past couple years by bets that trillions of dollars of money printing by the Fed would stoke inflation.  “We are expecting more sideways trading as eyes shift towards central bank meeting next week,” said Lennard Neo, analyst at Stack Funds.  CPI Report  After the release of the October CPI data, bitcoin shot up by almost $3,000 to quickly hit a new all-time high of $68,950. But within a few hours, the move reversed completely, and prices fell as more traders shifted to focus on the logical consequence of faster inflation: monetary-policy tightening by the Federal Reserve that might crimp demand for riskier assets from stocks to cryptocurrencies.  The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is currently trading around $47,400, down 31% from the all-time high reached in early November, when the last inflation report was released. Bitcoin is still up 64% on the year.  “Today’s inflation figures were marginally less than many were fearing, but the reality is that if you’re being paid less than 7% more than you were this time last year, your purchasing power is diminishing,” said Jason Deane, crypto analyst at Quantum Economics.  He said that “The Fed has no real tools left to try and fight it and is effectively strapped into the ride with the rest of us.”  Looking ahead, Deane expects to see a rapid upward movement in gold, major indices and bitcoin.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/10/us-inflation-rate-surges-to-68-in-november-a-4-decade-high-bitcoin-jumps,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ee0b5493ef2c2c792d30fdc9d922663b98da56a2-733x557.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Its completion brought the gift of music to a world that has known nothing more than the pastoral sounds of virtual harvest.  The tower is the result of a recent partnership between DeFi Land and Audius, a music streaming platform built on the Ethereum and Solana blockchains.  The upgrade allows users to stream any of the millions of songs in the Audius library while playing the game, and comes just in time for DeFi Land’s public launch, which is expected to be announced in the coming weeks.  DeFi Land, whose gameplay teaches gamers the concepts of decentralized finance through farming simulation, raised a $4.1 million funding round in September led by Animoca Brands and Alameda Research.  The partnership is Audius’ latest push to bring its tokenized music model to the mainstream. The service is modeled more after SoundCloud than Apple Music or Spotify, allowing users to upload their own music monetized through tokens instead of royalties.  Audius raised a $5 million funding round in September led by mainstream staples Katy Perry, Pusha T and The Chainsmokers.  “With DeFi Land, we’re sharing a new way to become involved in decentralized finance, a fresh take on the space,” DeFi Land founder DFL Erwin said in a press release. “Integrations like these are very valuable for mass adoption because they offer a unique user experience for easier and friendlier participation, and we look forward to seeing what comes next.”",POSITIVE,없음,ETH | SOL | SPONSORED,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/12/10/audius-is-building-a-radio-station-in-the-metaverse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/025d5c2c9287b6ef24df610286043daf5aa02474-2206x1152.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394330,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvc7yl,1639174704,How ‘Intelligent’ NFTs Raise Some Red Flags,"NFTs are on a clear collision course with artificial intelligence, which will in theory unlock all sorts of new utilities, including AI-driven avatars that can hold conversations.  However, because few people understand how this type of AI works, it’s alarmingly easy to hoodwink buyers. Recently, a handful of so-called smart or intelligent non-fungible token projects have begun minting digital nothingburgers, marketing them as groundbreaking “AI,” gaining endorsements from influential investors and breaking resale records. Soon, the market will be flooded with “AI NFTs,” the vast majority of which are absolutely, positively, NGMI (not going to make it).  Lauren Kunze is the CEO of Pandorabots, a leading chatbot platform that powers conversational AI applications for developers and global brands, and its subsidiary ICONIQ, which creates embodied AI like Kuki, a socialbot that has exchanged over a billion messages with 25 million human fans.  Here are five red flags to watch for:  1) It’s a cheap deepfake.  If you’ve yet to see a deepfake-powered moving portrait, the first time feels like some serious Harry Potter magic come to life. But this seeming wizardry is actually quite accessible to mere muggles through numerous free apps (e.g., TokkingHeads, MyHeritage, Wombo) that let you turn any image into deepfake content based on a source video. So if you are creating or already own NFTs and you want to make them move, you can do it yourself on the cheap. Anything beyond minimal movement like blinking or breathing may break the illusion due to inevitable incongruities between the image and its underlying source video. Thus, if you see a moving NFT that isn’t moving much, it’s almost certainly using off-the-shelf deepfake software, and not some special secret AI sauce.  These cheap deepfakes are being used to advertise things like portraits of historical figures which, when plugged into GPT-3, could converse with you in real time. The thing is, running a real-time conversation with an AI requires a 3D CG model. So if you stumble upon a deepfake advertised as capable of conversing in realtime, alarm bells should sound because deepfakes don’t really run autonomously. Rather, they rely on superimposing someone’s face on an actor in a video during post production (for example, Zuck on Trey Parker or Tom Cruise on a talented TikTok impersonator), or during a video call (say, Deep Elon Zoom-bombing using free software like Avatarify).  2) It uses GPT-3 or has other third-party dependencies.  The Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) language model is amazing at generating words and images in the style of a specific person or genre given enough examples. Giant, generative language models – apart from being slow to reply and so expensive to train that GPT-3, trained pre-COVID, remains unaware the virus exists – are trained on the public internet, which is a bit akin to drinking from a public toilet. Human beings are also typically toilet-mouthed monsters when talking to software (and each other) on the internet, but even the human players of a GPT-3-powered role play game were disturbed when the algorithm inserted children into sexual scenarios. That is why OpenAI takes great care to highly restrict chatbot use cases – and why any NFT project purporting to use GPT-3, especially to power add-on “personalities,” should raise eyebrows.  After years in limited beta with a long waitlist, OpenAI just announced that its GPT-3 API is now generally available to developers. (Until and unless Microsoft – which funded and apparently exclusively licensed GPT-3 – closes “Open” AI.) So far, some upstarts with early access have been using GPT-3 to create and sell unique “personalities” for your NFT. But now that the API is truly open to all, the reality is that anyone can generate a GPT-3 powered “personality” by feeding it a few example texts. Whether OpenAI allows your particular use case to remain live is another story. Last summer, the Chronicle published a heartbreaking tale about a man who used a GPT-3 powered service to bring his dead fiancé back to life based on their texts. Months later, in a heart-rending twist, OpenAI shuttered the service without warning for violating its stringent terms; Joshua’s fiancé Jessica essentially died twice. GPT-3 NFTs are liable to meet the same fate.NFTs are ultimately about verified ownership. If your chatty “AI” NFT depends on third-party services that the seller neither owns, develops, nor controls, what exactly do you actually own?  3) AI is “on the roadmap” (and all over the marketing materials).  While GPT-3 usage or any third-party dependency is reason for serious pause, “AI” in a project’s marketing materials or roadmap without any evidence of its existence in the actual product is a red flag. AI is not an ingredient anyone can simply add into the mix provided more resources and more time. Still, given the recent buzz surrounding some AI NFT projects, people are now prefacing projects with “AI” almost as fast as they are appending “metaverse” to everything.  4) The team has no AI background  When in doubt, a project’s team page is typically illuminating as to whether it has a prayer of accomplishing an ambitious AI roadmap. Zero AI expertise = huge red flag.  Even teams with AI know-how often struggle to deliver. For example, Little Sophia, a miniature of the uncanny humanoid Sophia Robot that has raised multiple rounds of crowdfunding since 2019, with a perpetually retreating ship date (December 2022 as of this writing) and increasingly irate, disillusioned backers. Sophia, who made headlines in May for selling an NFT that erroneously claimed to be the first digital art by a non-human, and whose creators have stated is “basically alive,” is a big part of the AI hype problem. (The NFT auctioned for $688,888 was in fact made in collaboration with a real human artist, and is decades-predated by AI digital artists like Harold Cohen’s Aaron).  Sadly, when it comes to the general public, these marketing gimmicks, including granting Sophia Saudi Arabian citizenship, actually seem to work. In 2017, an offshoot of the team behind Sophia raised $36 million in less than a minute in an Initial Coin Offering to build “Artificial General Intelligence” or decentralized “AGI” on the blockchain. Last I checked, they – along with the tech giants and top AI researchers – have yet to solve AGI. The moral of the story: even if the team has AI experience, they may still fall short, and if their primary background is in initial coin offerings, marketing, or other get-rich-quick schemes, it may be time to run for the hills.  5) A rose by another name smells … like a tulip.  Speaking of marketing, that guy who invented the analog pet rock was a genius. (Also a millionaire, after selling over a million pet rocks at four bucks a pop.) The rocks were just rocks, with a cute pun-filled care and feeding manual (spoiler alert: they required none) packaged in a cardboard box. But calling them a “pet” sparked a fad on par with Beanie Babies or, dare I say, Bored Apes. To wit, the “first iNFT, “which sold at auction at Sotheby’s for nearly half a million dollars, is in fact just a chatbot attached to an avatar: technology that, while less ancient than rocks, has been around since the 1960s. Which is perfectly fine, so long as buyers know that what they are buying is, in fact, just an embodied chatbot by another name.  Regardless of the packaging, chatbot powered avatars – ahem – AI NFTs are a promising “new” category (much like the metaverse is having a “second life”). NFTs stand to revolutionize digital ownership and put money where it rightfully belongs: back in the hands of creators. But even if the industry overcomes other hurdles like its high carbon footprint, we are only going to make it to mainstream adoption if we collectively call out scams and noise so that quality work can shine.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,Lauren Kunze,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/12/10/how-intelligent-nfts-raise-some-red-flags,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9a586a8ad7b37b09cd65c8d2a35200952fb790dc-612x408.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42422870,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0qYvh,1639172871,"After Major Crypto Sell-Off, Why Did DeFi Stay So Sticky?","According to the data, decentralized finance (DeFi) users might not be that degenerate after all.  Amid the dozens of introductory posts and explainers on DeFi from mainstream media outlets over the past year, a general consensus has emerged: While promising, DeFi is currently primarily utilized to speculate on crypto prices, using tools like lending platforms as a form of leverage.  Indeed, this line of thinking has been trotted out in The New York Times, Bloomberg and CNBC, among dozens of others. Likewise, Twitter traders wear the badge “degen,” short for “degenerate,” with pride, adding to a consensus that the field is a wild west of gamblers and speculators.  A look under the hood shows the majority of depositors are playing it safe, however – sometimes even safer than meatspace finance. DeFi is a wide swath of smart-contract-based applications that serve bank-like functions on the internet using decentralized blockchain tools.  Read more: Bitcoin Drops $9K in an Hour on Spot Market Selling; El Salvador Again Buys the Dip  Last weekend, a pullback across crypto markets ravaged spot prices and wiped out leveraged traders on centralized exchanges. Bitcoin (BTC) fell as far as $42,000 from $57,000 before a relief bounce, while ether (ETH) plummeted as low as $3,500 from $4,600.  DeFi’s closely watched total value locked (TVL) figure remained comparatively unchanged, however, dropping from $270 billion to just $260 billion, and maintaining a range the sector has held since November.  In interviews with CoinDesk, a number of industry experts said the outperformance is in part attributable to DeFi users being more cautious than some would expect – and, if DeFi were ever to experience prolonged outflows, that relative conservatism would be to blame.  Leverage vs. income  For derivatives traders on centralized exchanges, last week’s dip was one of the most violent in history.  As CoinDesk reported, price action early in the week washed out over $187 million of positions. Futures open interest (OI) in particular dropped nearly 25%, wiping out $5.4 billion in OI from a $22 billion total.  Read more: Bitcoin Drops 5%, Slipping Below $50K on Leverage Washouts  Given that leverage traders and derivatives speculators were so thoroughly routed on centralized exchanges, it would be easy to assume that DeFi would suffer a similar pullback.  On-chain data, however, tells a different story.  Liquidations across DeFi’s top lending platforms, including Aave, Compound and Maker, topped just over $66 million in the trough of the pullback, according to a Dune Analytics dashboard – a tiny fraction of the space’s current $280 billion in TVL. Additionally, the liquidations account for just .01% of Aave, Compound and Maker’s combined $42.37 billion in TVL.  Ashwath Balakrishnan, director of research at investment and research firm Delphi Digital, said that part of the reason why is that DeFi loans are often even less leveraged than real-world ones.  “The loans that you see on Aave and Compound, they’re a lot more prudent than the ones you’d see even at a bank mortgage,” Balakrishnan said. “At a bank you can get a mortgage for a loan-to-value of anywhere between 60%-80% depending on your credit score. But if you look at Aave and Compound, the larger loans that go through the loan to value is between 10% and 15% to 50%. That’s playing it super safe.”  Additionally, he said that tracking users borrowing stablecoins shows the majority of loans aren’t being used to trade, but instead to provide liquidity to protocols like Curve.  “I would disagree with the notion that a lot of it is being used to margin trade or that the leverage is unhealthy,” he added.  Daniel Khoo, a researcher for analytics platform Nansen, likewise noted that during the drawdown inflows to platforms like Beta Finance and Lido’s stETH showed that DeFi yield farmers continued to work the fields in spite of market action.  Khoo told CoinDesk in an interview that DeFi TVL might outperform spot prices in part because they simply provide attractive income opportunities difficult to find in other financial products.  “The ability to earn a good yield, risk-adjusted, causes capital to be more sticky and thus TVL to be more resilient. This is often compared to parking capital in 0% interest rate savings accounts or even bonds (which might or might not have a better risk-reward ratio),” he said.  Continued outperformance  While this analysis challenges the prevailing narrative that DeFi is primarily used for leverage and speculation, experts say a prolonged drawdown in spot prices could eventually lead to a flight from DeFi and a severe reduction in TVL.  According to the pseudonymous founder of data website DeFi Llama, 0xNGMI, DeFi’s deposits have built-in resiliency due to dollar-pegged stablecoins, and users favor battle-tested smart contracts that are seen as less risky.  “There’s a tendency for crypto natives to keep their assets in crypto so if a bear market comes and most people shift their portfolios to stables, you’ll end up with a bunch of money in the hands of people comfortable with smart contracts and of which a portion of them will keep it in DeFi,” 0xNGMI said.  However, a large portion of the yield in DeFi relies on froth: depositors to Uniswap liquidity pools, for instance, make money on trade volume, and froth increases their returns.  According to pseudonymous eGirl Capital contributor CL207, eventually the returns could drift low enough that perceived smart contract risk – the fear that a platform might be hacked or exploited – will outweigh the returns, and a prolonged dip could “nuke” DeFi as users seek income elsewhere.  “I called [DeFi TVL] like some sorta alternative OI because it is direct data to show there is $ participating in some sorta play, where risk is higher than normal,” CL told CoinDesk in a Twitter message. “Futures [are] higher risk than spot, yield farming on chain [is] higher risk than just lending USDC out on FTX. Similar logic.”  It remains to be seen how acute a drawdown in TVL could be, but DeFi Llama’s 0xNGMI believes that deposits could prove sticky.  “TVL is highly correlated with time-weighted froth, and APRs will be crushed in bear, but I don’t think TVL will be reversed because there’s a barrier to adoption that only needs to be crossed once,” he said.  He compared the phenomena to depositors learning how to “bridge” to other chains over the summer – while Polygon, one of the first sidechains with a real ecosystem, took time to build up steam, Avalanche expanded rapidly as users were accustomed to bridging from Ethereum.  “I believe that also applies to putting your money on smart contracts,” he added.  Ultimately, however, these risk-reward calculations on the part of depositors are far different from the ones made by leverage or derivative traders, and DeFi’s TVL chart reflects that.  “I think this notion of DeFi as a haven of leverage is false, and it’s provably false,” said Delphi Digital’s Balakrishnan. “If you ignore the narratives from the detractors and actually look at the data, you’ll see it yourself.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/12/10/after-major-crypto-sell-off-why-did-defi-stay-so-sticky,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6627c984f4f20d47e50c3da3cc78fb933130699a-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411139,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gj7Sqd,1639172419,The Two Miami Art Weeks,"Near the doors to the Miami Airport Convention Center – by a parked Ferrari studded with kitten stickers, just across from a pavilion known as the “Metaverse Dome” – a man was trying to put ice cream on the blockchain. Jaunty and pimpled, he sat beside a truck that appeared to be giving away free samples.  Only the samples weren’t free, exactly. I could have one, explained the young promoter, if I opted to join the Discord server for Creemees, a collection of 9,999 NFTs (or non-fungible tokens) resembling individual cones. When I showed him that I’d done it, he handed me a Bomb Pop.  “Welcome to the community,” he said. I tapped on “leave server.”  Shilling is the heart and soul of the NFT economy, a place where something as simple as accepting a free popsicle is inevitably reframed as an endorsement of a speculative financial asset. Spend enough time there and you’ll end up shilling, too.  The occasion for this particular gambit was DCentral, a crypto conference timed to Miami Art Week – a balmy new landing for the blockchain invasion.  Most of the festivities centered around Art Basel itself, now a metonym for the entire cluster of events, along with Untitled Art Fair, Scope, NADA Miami, and many more shows concentrated in and around Miami Beach. This was where you’d find the paintings, the ceramics, the meticulously assembled romans photos. You might call it the “traditional art” side of this year’s Miami Art week.  The other, perhaps less inhibited side had to do with the arrival of NFTs, the crypto-backed mechanisms for “owning” files on the internet. They’ve been around, in tech circles, but it’s only in the past year that they’ve begun to collide with the traditional art world in a significant way.  Christie’s was the first major auction house to capitalize on the craze, thanks in large part to the efforts of a tattooed curator named Noah Davis. When the digital artist Beeple sold an NFT for $69 million at the storied auction house this past March, everyone else started to get it, too.  On Friday, when the website ArtReview released its annual “Power 100″ list of the most influential figures in art, it was the ERC-721 – one of the oldest and most dominant flavors of NFT – that claimed the top spot, beating out the likes of Fred Moten, Kara Walker, David Zwirner and Larry Gogosian.  “It’s hard to predict the long-term upset this bit of code will cause,” reads a celebratory blurb on the site. “But in 2021, all the old assumptions of the art market and art culture have been thrown into chaotic, creative uncertainty.”  That uncertainty was on full display in Miami, as a cabal of crypto believers descended on the city for an array of tech fairs in the days leading up to the major art shows.  Crypto people tend to love conferences (there seems to be a new one every week), and this may be doubly true for NFT people. The DCentral conference consisted of panels (mostly droning advertisements and promotional speeches, along with a few talks involving journalists) and a massive, mazelike “crypto fair,” complete with real-world NFT galleries and booths for companies. Fluorescents hummed; the smell of pizza grease was inescapable. Standing next to me in line for the bathroom, an attendee compared it (favorably, I think) to an oil and gas trade show.  Also in attendance was Hard Rock Nick, a stout, peculiarly bearded man, whose depraved viral videos about modern dating made him something of a niche meme a few years ago. He was there representing a DeFi company called Pangolin. “I need to flex,” he told me, holding a comically large Louis Vuitton wallet just a few inches from my face.  The panels at DCentral were reminiscent of those at NFT.NYC, the crypto conference I’d attended just four weeks earlier, in that they were mostly characterized by a kind of corporate technobabble. Web 3 investors and metaverse adherents pelted the audience with buzzwords. Finance would be disrupted, they said. Art was already being destabilized, even democratized. Attendees silently nodded along.  The week’s other major crypto conference, NFT BZL, drew from a similar psychic reservoir. The venue, FTX Arena (recently renamed for crypto billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange), was bathed in a discomfiting blacklight. Just outside, a DJ blasted a combination of trance and house music into the humid downtown air. I traced the perimeter collecting free t-shirts.  Despite all the talk of inclusion, there wasn’t a lot of sympathy for the uninitiated. The experience was more “have fun staying poor” than “WAGMI.”  The irony of “WAGMI” – today’s reigning crypto meme, short for “we’re all gonna make it” – is that it’s come to stand for something profoundly alienating. The implication is that we are all going to make it. That is, we few warriors for financial inclusion, we knights errant with our JPEG banners. The “frens” on the inside. People muttered about the silliness of “environmental FUD,” the idea that crypto is somehow bad for the environment. If you don’t get it, you don’t get it; no point addressing the detractors. LFG!  A highlight was seeing Jeff Marsilio, the CEO of a crypto company called Niftys, acknowledge that tension explicitly. “[People] are going on Twitter and seeing lots of people bragging about all the money that they’re making,” he said. “That turns people off, man. Nobody wants to hear about the money that you’re making.”  It’s difficult to imagine the unconvinced being swayed by the blindingly expensive NFTs plastered on the attendees themselves. One collector told me he commissioned custom NFT patches (among them a CryptoPunk, a Bored Ape, and a Cool Cat) from a “tiny atelier in Paris” through a site called NFT-A-Porter.  Another trader, known online as @swagdolphinn, told me he had a shirt made of his cool cat: #6100 in the limited series of 9,999. “It’s the first cat I got,” he said of the NFT on his shirt. “I love it. It represents me. It represents everything about me. I don’t think I could ever sell it.”  After a few handfuls of Planters trail mix and a glass of complementary prosecco, I headed to an NFT talk at Untitled Art Fair, on South Beach, hosted by curators and artists from the traditional art world. Turnout was low, and skepticism was high. The interdisciplinary artist Ori Carino spoke about the line between populist crypto “collectibles” and what collectors might consider “art.” Many NFT collectors will readily cop to that distinction (how many members of the Bored Ape Yacht Club are in it for the art?) and yet there was a hint of defensiveness in Carino’s voice, as if pre-emptively countering the objections of any NFT cynics in the crowd.  And while the art side of the week remained mostly distinct from the crypto side, those boundaries started to blur at night, when everyone started chasing parties – suddenly, it no longer seemed to matter who was hosting. Soho Beach House was a communal hotspot; there was a “Coinbase Yacht” in the Museum Park Marina, which was more of a floating cocktail lounge than an active vessel; younger crowds found their way to the comparatively trendy environs of Mac’s Club Deuce and Twist, in Miami Beach.  On Wednesday night, at an event co-sponsored by this website, Pitbull gave a rousing five-minute speech analogizing the city of Miami to a “pineapple” before disappearing into the crowd, while in the lobby of the Beachcomber Hotel, guests staged impromptu photo shoots amid rows of physical NFT screens. Erykah Badu and Azealia Banks performed that night, too, at an outdoor party for the crypto social club Friends with Benefits. The show was technically reserved for holders of $FWB, the group’s governance token, but outsiders seemed to find their way in anyway. Here, the tech crowd mingled with bona fide celebrities (newly minted Bored Ape fan Diplo among them), brandishing plastic cups of undiluted tequila.  That sense of the collective – the thrill of finally being together in person, unmediated by Twitter DMs and Discord channels – was palpable at Zoratopia, a day-long event sponsored by the NFT company Zora, and led by a group of Black artists and influencers with experience in the space. Latashá Alcindor, a rapper and crypto advocate, played the role of the MC, curating the meditative “sound bath” that opened the morning, and wrangling a loose collective of organizers, developers and collectors for a group discussion on the pleasures and pitfalls of a blockchain-backed metaverse.  Zoratopia was partly a reaction to NFT.NYC, which Alcindor has described as feeling somewhat hostile, even racist. Near the end of that week, Alcindor said that a performance of hers was shut down after just one song, by a music director who claimed it was too “aggressive” (the venue, New York’s Public hotel, did not respond to a request for comment).  Friday was a rare moment of respite – an unexpected ending to the breathless hype cycle set in motion earlier in the week.  Back at NFT BZL, COVID protocols had been nonexistent; conference-goers milled about in WAGMI merch and hats that read “PRIVACY” and “$NFTZ.” On my way out I passed a group of uniformed middle schoolers, presumably on a field trip, slowly making their way toward the merch stands outside the main stage. I wondered what they’d buy there.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Will Gottsegen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/12/10/the-two-miami-art-weeks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/87ce2e067355636791ed19771f122a03c2dd0b17-3024x2268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420825,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYlB7,1639170231,What Would a Mutual Aid DAO Look Like?,"Though it’s not exactly a new idea, the phrase “mutual aid” first came to prominence last year, after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. It tends to connote small, loosely organized collectives working to support communities from within – the kinds of local support systems that can be crucial during tough times.  Pact is a New York-based organization looking to facilitate these systems with a subscription-based curatorial framework. Make a recurring donation to Pact, and it will give the money to a different mutual aid group each month. It started up last year as a response to the pandemic and was officially incorporated this summer.  Now, Pact is trying to bolster those donations with a fundraiser on the crypto-backed publishing platform Mirror. It’s selling three batches of NFTs (non-fungible tokens) at different price points, which will offer access to eventual workshops and events, and give buyers an early preview of an online “community platform” that’s still being developed. In about two weeks, Pact has raised 3.81 ETH, or about $15,000, for its handpicked rotation of mutual aid groups.  “Most people, when they think about donating, they can only name two or three ‘mega nonprofits’ like ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union) or Planned Parenthood,” Pact founder Marisa Rando said. “We really wanted to connect people – or, people really wanted to be connected – to the organizations in their backyard.”  Rando, a content strategist at the payments company Block (formerly Square), explained that while she’s still skeptical about much of crypto, she’s fascinated by DAOs, or decentralized autonomous organizations – a kind of online community built around tokens. Joining a DAO involves purchasing a certain number of tokens, which work like voting shares in a company; at least until regulators decide to handle things differently, DAOs are like online companies you don’t actually have to incorporate: Everyone involved has a real stake in what’s been built.  Pact’s Mirror crowdfund will eventually form the basis of PactDAO, a community for people looking to engage with mutual aid in New York City.  “We’re trying to create this collaboration on a massive scale, so that more people in New York can be organizing and contributing funds,” Rando said. “Right now, our current technology stack just doesn’t really allow the kind of democracy and scale that we want to create – the Mirror fund was a way to get that vision out into the world.”  Where most DAOs just give out governance tokens in proportion to what you put in (e.g. 100 tokens for .1 ETH, or 1,000 tokens for 1 ETH), PactDAO plans to assign tokens according to nonfinancial participation, too. Joining in on community events might earn you a greater share of tokens. It’s a kind of cooperative structure; the largest donors won’t automatically get the most say in how the DAO develops, and the most active organizers can be rewarded. “Pact is not like other social clubs,” reads a slogan on the group’s Mirror landing page. “We’ll call it a socialist club.”  Since the current version of Mirror doesn’t allow for this distribution model, contributors to Pact’s crypto crowdfund will still get a certain amount of $PACT tokens according to what they put in. Rando is stressing that these are “just for fun” – there are no plans to establish a liquidity pool for secondary market trading.  And although PactDAO and Pact’s accompanying tech platform are still being built, the organization already has a track record of funneling money to grassroots organizations that need it most. In the early days of the pandemic, when Rando was experimenting with potential fundraising models for Pact, she collected and divvied up the donations herself.  “I created this website for people to fill out this form for where they wanted money to go, and they would give me money,” she said. “I was making donations on their behalf, and putting their name on the receipt and forwarding emails. I was just, like, this really manual middleman.”  That is to say, Rando has done the work. She’s also aware of the challenges: The kinds of left-leaning donors she’s looking to target might be put off by Ethereum’s environmental impact, or its potential to replicate existing capitalistic systems. The Mirror crowdfund is geared toward people looking to give much more, too – the NFTs start at over $400 in ETH, not including fees.  That’s why, despite the buzz around the ETH crowdfund, Pact is still very much taking U.S. dollars. You can still make a $3 monthly donation on the group’s website; crypto is just one part of a broader vision.  “We don’t want to create a silo of tech people determining mutual aid,” Rando said. “That’s definitely the opposite of where we want to be.”",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Will Gottsegen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/12/10/what-would-a-mutual-aid-dao-look-like,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d3ca08ce44e056bb8c8aa896090edcec47e40f34-5760x3840.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Remember when Dennis Rodman promoted Potcoin in North Korea and DJ Khaled endorsed Centra’s ICO? This year, celebrities also jumped the bandwagon, but in a somewhat more wholesome way, promoting the emergent world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). This also drew jeers, but the impact of celebrities in moving mainstream audiences to crypto was undeniable. Musicians like 3LAU made the case for NFTs, while hotel heiress Paris Hilton was a surprisingly eloquent advocate for crypto.

But it was that sale, made in Ethereum’s currency ETH, that brought the sub-sector to public consciousness. Winkelmann was a successful artist before NFTs, having worked with several mainstream brands and artists, but the auction of “EVERYDAYS: THE FIRST 5000 DAYS,” a collage of his previous 13-years of work, has made him one of the most successful artists to date (behind only Leonardo da Vinci and Jeff Koons in terms of highest grossing sales). Beeple answered a few questions from CoinDesk. Here is an edited version of the interview:  The Complete List: CoinDesk’s Most Influential 2021  How do you make sense of this year?

Oooo that’s a tough question, but I think I’d have to go with that NFT I sold for $69M. ;)  Name one big plan for 2022 (NFTs or otherwise).  I plan to continue to try to bring as many people to this space as possible and educate them about NFTs and digital art. We are still very, very early and most people do not understand what is happening. I want to show the immense potential this technology has.  How is crypto going to change the world by 2030?  I think we are going to continue to see more and more adoption and full integration of Web 3 into many different facets of the internet.

42411137,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gj7SdP,1639167369,Most Influential 2021: Matt Hall and John Watkinson,"This year, everyone from Jimmy Fallon to Jay-Z decided to express themselves on social media using cartoon Apes and pixelated heads as avatars. This “profile picture” (or PFP) craze was part of an overall explosion in non-fungible token (NFTs). CryptoPunks, an early NFT project, was one of 2021′s biggest winners. Only 10,000 unique tokens were ever minted – each corresponding to a portrait of a punky-looking guy, gal, zombie, alien or ape – created through an art generator on the Ethereum blockchain. It sounds silly, but some of these tokens have sold for millions of dollars. (Though the highest priced sale to date – $530 million – was more of a publicity stunt.)  The project was started by a team of two Canadian software developers, Matt Hall and John Watkinson, who call themselves “creative technologists.” And many of the attributes they blended into CryptoPunks can be found throughout the NFT scene – any project, like Bored Apes or Pudgy Penguins, that has a limited mint of 10,000 tokens owes them a debt of gratitude. CryptoPunks is now a part of Ethereum’s aesthetics, and its intellectual property belongs to Larva Labs, the company Hall and Watkinson founded.  This year, Larva Labs unveiled two new NFT projects, Meebits and Autoglyphs. Together with the punks, those projects are being represented by major Hollywood powerhouse, United Talent Agency.

42411128,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gj7S9e,1639167362,Most Influential 2021: Robert Leshner,"Good morning. Robert Leshner has built one of the essential cornerstones of decentralized finance (DeFi) with Compound, a lending protocol. This year, Compound Treasury launched, providing a pathway for non-crypto financial institutions to earn yields in the rapidly expanding “institutional DeFi” sub-sector. That’s important. As are the series of investments Leshner has made in fledging DeFi projects through a “scout” fund he co-founded, Robot Ventures. He’s right at the center of decentralized finance, helping both large and small players get started. But you might say his affect and personality are just as influential.  In late September, when a bug was introduced into the autonomous Compound protocol, which then erroneously disbursed $80 million worth of COMP to some users, Leshner handled the situation poorly – at first. He seemed to threaten users with Federal action when asking that they return the funds. This caused some confusion and consternation. Realizing this, Leshner quickly apologized, owned up to his “bone-headed” statement made in haste and exhibited a type of leadership that’s rare in crypto with the resolve to admit fault. Leshner may not be a philosopher-king, but in calling the decision whether to reimburse Compound a “moral dilemma,” he showed that humans still have an important role to play in DeFi, even if robots run the code.  Here is what Leshner expects for Compound in 2022: “Compound Labs plans to grow Compound Treasury into a primary bridge between traditional financial markets and DeFi, and release new research/products for the Compound community to use, modify and adopt.”  The Complete List: CoinDesk’s Most Influential 2021  CORRECTION (DEC. 12, 5:40 UTC): Updates language that suggested Compound was hacked and around Leshner’s statement at the time.",POSITIVE,COMP,BLOCKCHAIN | COMP | MARKET | REGULATION,CoinDesk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/12/10/most-influential-2021-robert-leshner,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/09ca36b296f6108a5f2e139eca0fd60dadfaf219-560x560.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411143,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gj7Stw,1639163733,Most Influential 2021: Do Kwon,"Do Kwon, the 29-year-old founder of Terraform Labs, was running late. Being subpoenaed by a hired hand of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) didn’t help – not that he knew what was coming. Due to appear on stage at any minute at Mainnet 2021, a major cryptocurrency conference in New York City, a process server slipped him a manilla folder, which he accepted unthinkingly, he said. He threw it in his backpack, got on stage and forgot about it.  He still hasn’t read the document, now in his lawyer’s possession, Kwon told CoinDesk in an interview in November. “I didn’t read the press release, but it seemed like they were talking about MIR or something like that,” he said, with practiced nonchalance. He’s referring to the mirror token (MIR), an asset he helped design that’s used on the platform of that same name.  This article is part of CoinDesk’s Most Influential 2021 list. Jake the Degen’s portrait of Do Kwon is currently up for private auction, with a portion of the proceeds going to the Chicago Community Bond Fund through The Giving Block.  The Mirror Protocol, indeed the project in the SEC’s sights, makes it easy to create and trade synthetic versions of other assets – like highly regulated U.S. stocks – without restriction. The SEC is investigating whether Mirror falls afoul of the law for just that reason: enabling the sale of unregistered securities. It’s a serious offense, but hardly rare in crypto.  “When I’m trying to launch things, my primary area of interest isn’t what the state would appreciate,” Kwon said. A Korean national, who spent years in Canada and graduated with a bachelor’s degree in computer science from Stanford University in California, Kwon is committed to the global aspirations of cryptocurrency. He’s rarely clear about his political leanings, but likes the practical and material effects crypto can bring about.  Mirror is just a small part of a constellation of apps forming around Terra, a base layer blockchain Kwon’s team is building out. Like other expansive crypto projects, the so-named Terranauts’ lodestar is to improve financial access – bar none – using open platforms.  But Terra is different in that it’s a fully-fledged, self-contained (yet open-source) alternative financial ecosystem shipped almost entirely by Terraform Labs. In the world of decentralized finance (DeFi), there are alternative banks, credit systems, insurers and the like. Terra has all that too, just built around its unique financial instrument called UST, a stablecoin that maintains a peg to the U.S. dollar using an algorithm (as opposed to other stablecoins that maintain reserves corresponding to the tokens).  By all accounts, Terraform Labs has done the improbable. Stablecoins, a cornerstone of the emergent crypto economy, are a type of digital asset that retains the open-access ethos of bitcoin, without the volatility, in theory. But in seeking to do away with price fluctuations, most stablecoins today are managed by corporations or consortia, like Tether or Circle, with the ability to censor and reverse transactions. Terra takes a decentralized approach, which has seemed to pay off where many other “algorithmic stablecoins” have crashed and burned.  Jake the Degen’s portrait of Do Kwon is currently up for private auction, with a portion of the proceeds going to the Chicago Community Bond Fund through The Giving Block.  A fully open financial system needs to start with fully censorship-resistant money, Kwon said. So far it’s paid off: UST is now the fifth-largest stablecoin and growing. Because it doesn’t require fiat-backing, Terra is also able to easily spin out tokens that track major currencies like euros and Japanese yen. But even in crypto, greenbacks rule. Apart from crypto-to-crypto trading, most economic activity in the subsector is quoted in U.S. dollars. And so UST is Terra’s largest coin. When I started researching this story, UST was worth some $6 billion. Less than a month later it’s above $8 billion. Money is a technology, Kwon said, and it could be improved.  “We think that decentralized stablecoins should replace tether,” Kwon said, referring to the current market leader. But a decentralized stablecoin has implications for the world outside crypto – and the project’s success requires playing fast and loose with current laws and norms, he said. “What we do pay attention to are things like, ‘is what we’re doing something that is net positive to users of financial applications? is this more helpful to the formation of, let’s say, fair markets?’” Kwon said.  Read more: Olympus DAO Might Be the Future of Money (or It Might Be a Ponzi)  Those are questions that once may have been the sole remit of securities regulators, whose purpose is to maintain the integrity of markets, to answer. But we live in the crypto age, where people like Kwon can have their say. When anyone can build and ship a protocol that, once released, has a legitimate shot at taking on a life of its own among a group of contributors – who are motivated to use and maintain a bit of code that literally prints money – do the regulators still matter?  The SEC, under new management, is taking a more aggressive stance against the crypto industry this year. Chairman Gary Gensler has said that the majority of crypto tokens are likely securities, and therefore the agency’s responsibility. He’s also invited founders of crypto firms to discuss their platforms and ambitions – a process that Terra has engaged in.  As part of its subpoena, the financial watchdog demands that Kwon and Terraform turn over documents and provide testimony related to a platform that, by design, doesn’t collect customer information or set limits around who can access it. In an hours-long, in-person meeting before any paperwork was filed, federal agents allegedly asked for data about who owns MIR tokens and who uses Mirror.  “We don’t have that information,” Kwon said. He added that the agency was confusing Mirror with a traditional company, rather than a free software project. “I don’t think people believe us,” he said. The agency said Kwon has deliberately stymied their inquiry.  “We have limited visibility into, like, what exactly they’re thinking here,” Kwon said. This isn’t just dismissive swagger. Last month, he and Terraform sued the SEC for “failure to follow its own rules,” their lawsuit read, when serving Kwon at the highly trafficked crypto conference held at a Times Square hotel. Although Terra’s subpoena is mostly focused on procedural issues – never calling into question the long arm of U.S. law, just how clumsy it can be – Kwon seems prepared to make a larger statement.  “If we really are fighting for a revolution, I think for people at the vanguard it is incumbent on us to make sure that we speak out, make sure that the views of the industry are heard,” Kwon said. The experience working with and now resisting the SEC has been edifying (even if Kwon claims not to have read their paperwork), if only because it has made him realize the gravity behind Terra.  Real solutions  The son of a pharmaceutical and medical equipment distributor, Kwon grew up traveling the world. He was a “nerd,” as a teenager, but “not nerdy,” he said. He liked reading, especially theoretical works, but didn’t get to “The Fountainhead” or “Atlas Shrugged” until college, when he roomed with the president of the Ayn Rand Society. He’s smart. He takes cues from other Silicon Valley visionaries, and mostly wears black t-shirts. After five years at Stanford, he took a software engineering job at Microsoft. He quickly got bored.  His first company, Anyfi, was founded in 2016 to solve a “real problem.” It used a mesh network to relay bandwidth to those without internet access. Kwon raised $1 million in grants from angel investors and the South Korean government. It was through experimenting with this distributed network that he first started learning about cryptocurrency. In 2017, seeing the crypto market explode in value without actually providing “real use,” he decided to mend the gap.  Together with a college friend Nicholas Platias, Kwon wrote an initial white paper for a decentralized payments system that would make sense to an average person. The idea was to have a stable currency, pegged to fiat, that could be used by anyone, anywhere on or offline. It’s the type of project that could have gone nowhere – a flash of brilliance, or desperation, from a two-man team living off ramen and jumping from Airbnb to Airbnb in Seoul, South Korea – had it not been for a fortunate encounter with Daniel Shin.  Shin, a co-founder of Ticket Monster, is a legendary figure in the Korean tech scene. His e-commerce site was founded in 2010 with just a 5 million won annual budget, and quickly grew into one of the nation’s largest internet companies. By the time he met Kwon, his career was in its second act. He had sold Ticket Monster, and was looking for the next wave of Korean tech businesses to advise and invest in.  Read More: LUNA Hits All-Time High as Terra Community Passes Popular Burn Proposal  He saw in Kwon a kindred spirit. Just as Kwon became disillusioned by the world of big tech, Shin had direct experience with how the online-payments space is filled with rent-seekers, or those whose minor technological innovations are underdone by profit-seeking. A decentralized solution would not only be fairer, but more useful.  Terraform Labs incorporated in early 2018 to oversee the development of a new e-commerce platform called Chai. Unlike many payments apps, like Stripe, Chai would be built from the ground up using cryptocurrency infrastructure. Initially focused on the Asian market, it was a product created with the world in mind: being able to accept payment in any fiat money, convert to stablecoins and pay out vendors in the local currency. Terraform chose not to make money from transactions using its UST stablecoin, instead relying on outside funding to build something like a “digital commons,” Kwon said.  For consumers, Chai functions like a neo-bank, able to plug into their existing accounts – including debit and credit cards, digital wallets, wires and PayPal – to make online shopping easier. For merchants it is a quicker, cheaper settlement layer. Crucially, neither side needs to know they’re interacting with a blockchain. “What’s so striking about Chai is its ability to bring people into the Web 3 economy without them knowing it,” tech writer and former venture capitalist Mario Gabriele wrote in his SubStack The Generalist.  Jake the Degen’s portrait of Do Kwon is currently up for private auction, with a portion of the proceeds going to the Chicago Community Bond Fund through The Giving Block.  Shin’s tech contacts helped Terra find an impressive roster of early clients. When the company was looking to raise capital, they were able to point to 15 established Asian e-commerce businesses actually using the tool. They signed up hospitals and delivery services and started marketing their “solution” as “Alipay on the blockchain,” referencing the dominant payments app in China built by Alibaba. By the end of the year, the team raised $32 million from leading cryptocurrency exchanges Binance, OKEx and Huobi and TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington, among others.  Chai has since spun out from Terraform Labs, an early example of the quasi startup incubator’s ability to code projects and release them into the world. It has thousands of merchant users, including Korea-based arms of Nike and Philip Morris. In 2020, it even raised its own venture funding independent of Terraform, in a round led by Hanwha Investment & Securities with participation from SoftBank Ventures Asia.  Kwon said he retains an advisory role in Chai, but isn’t involved day-to-day in the company. It’s a remarkable departure from just three years ago, when Chai was almost a singular vision. At a CNBC business conference in 2018, Kwon spoke about the payments app using language familiar to any tech founder, discussing “the next country,” “next hospital” it would “integrate” with. “Korea runs on Terra,” he said, because Koreans were using Chai.  Over time, he said, he’s become “more and more scoped out,” less focused on single products than an overall economy that works for more than just one company. “From a decentralization perspective, we [at Terraform] try to build as quickly as possible. But to the confusion of many observers, we don’t take an ownership stake,” Kwon said.  “It gives you a lot of freedom in terms of what you can build if you don’t plan to own these things,” he said.  Better money?  Mirror, the Robinhood-like synthetics-trading tool under SEC investigation, launched as the new year was beginning. It came just months after Terraform collaborated with Cosmos, Web3 Foundation and Solana on Anchor, a sort of savings platform. Throughout 2021, Terraform has kept pace with this development schedule, pushing out a new platform or upgrade every few months. Every tool is a way to make UST a “superior form” of money, Kwon said.  “It just offers a fundamentally better experience that other money is lacking right now,” Kwon said. U.S. dollars may be an effective medium of exchange and a store of value, but in the fiat financial system it’s hard to find returns. There are limits around what you can do with your dollars, and inflation is bleeding a hole in your wallet.  UST’s value comes from the applications that are built around it. Terraform is incentivizing adoption of its stablecoin by building a suite of use cases. There’s Anchor, the bank-like platform, which offers users 20% returns on their savings. It’s open source, so other crypto wallets can add “savings-as-a-service” to their products. At launch, Kwon compared it to Alipay, which saw success by providing users a better savings rate if they held cash in their mobile app. People come for the high yield and stay because UST is more usable money.  But there’s also Prism, a type of yield generator for interest rate swaps; Ozone, an insurance product for the Terra ecosystem to protect against risks of novel DeFi systems; and Astroport, a decentralized exchange like Uniswap for Terra. Then Mirror, which gives people 24/7 access to “one of the most attractive investments” – U.S. equities. Instead of buying Alibaba shares directly, you take on exposure through mBABA.

I’ll say that, right?” Kwon said. “There are pros and cons of taking an industry that was fairly regulated and opening that up to be freely tradable. You basically remove those like checks and balances and barriers.” While this might open the door to nefarious actors, like insider traders looking to cash in on nonpublic news without divulging their identity, Mirror – and its sister applications – allow people in “Malaysia that can’t travel to Kuala Lumpur” to access essential financial services. “So, ups and downs,” Kwon said.  Most of these tools connect to one another – creating a full-service financial system. But Terraform has also worked to bridge its tools to the surrounding crypto ecosystem. A recent update called “Columbus-5″ will help bridge these tools to other blockchains. While the Mars Protocol, built alongside Delphi Labs, IDEO CoLab and others, promises an “interchain lending platform.” A recent $150 million capital injunction for protocol development from Arrington Capital, Galaxy Digital and Hashed means more playthings are coming down the pike.  It’s a development schedule that has earned Kwon some comparisons to autocratic leaders like Steve Jobs. On Twitter he’s sometimes seen directing his employees to push out a product over the weekend. Some criticize him for performativity, aping the techno-utopian, pro-markets Silicon Valley founder style. “If by capitalist you mean somebody that has access to lots of capital and uses it to gain strategic games then I would say, you know, almost by accident, I have lots of capital,” Kwon responded.  The aim is to have Terra become the dominant smart contract blockchain, and have its tools implemented wherever “there happens to be developer and user activity.” That means tools need to be built. But Kwon thinks this strategy can only go so far. He thinks of Terraform Labs as “a transient aberration.” Eventually the plan is to transition into a DAO-like model, or a decentralized autonomous organization, where users have control.  That’s a hard jump to make, but not impossible. And Terraform Labs does build things with that eventuality in mind. Kwon said platforms like Mirror and Anchor, which have individual governance tokens, are “fair launched,” meaning Terraform doesn’t keep “equity or ownership” in them. “We’ve built an ecosystem that was, you know, built by us but not necessarily owned by us,” he said.  Decentralize or bust  Obviously there are risks to Kwon’s strategy. The money at the center of the Terra universe – an algorithmic stablecoin – could fly out of orbit. It’s happened to plenty of other currencies that try to maintain stability without centralized control. So far, its two-token model, which uses a free-floating asset called luna that is either burned or minted to nudge UST back towards equilibrium, seems to work.  Then there are the regulatory risks. Mirror is being called into question, but Kwon admits “the state” probably isn’t too thrilled about the idea of a decentralized dollar. The catch being, if Terra works like he wants it to, there would be nothing governments or corporations can do. Terra is already integrated within one of Korea’s largest payments apps, Chai, and could become systemically important elsewhere.  For all the vim and vigor, Kwon is still realistic. “If you’re trying to build, you know, networks and systems at scale, having to deal with regulators is, you know, just the reality,” he said. “Regulatory pressure is, yes, an inconvenience. But it helps us determine what actually makes sense and what doesn’t.”  He thinks back to the 2018 initial coin offering (ICO) boom that brought him into the industry. Most of those projects were centralized institutions masquerading as protocols. “It was quite terrible,” he said. To the extent that regulation helps flush these actors out, leaving only the resilient, the truly distributed, state financial actors are “worthwhile.” They can have their say.  “Centralized entities are bound to fail at some point,” Kwon said. Terraform Labs had an impressive 2021, but it remains an open question whether it can move on to its next phase and truly let its tools exist on their own. If that happens, then a subpoena really isn’t anything to pay attention to.

The Puell Multiple confirms that miners don&apos;t want to sell at the current price level. Bitcoin Miner Reserves Grow To Highest Value For The Year As pointed out by a CryptoQuant post, BTC miner reserve has been going up as miners seem to be waiting before selling. There are two indicators of relevance here. The first is the &apos;miner reserve,&apos; which is a metric that simply measures the amount of Bitcoin that miners are currently holding in their wallets. An uptrend of this indicator implies miners are accumulating their coins rather than selling. On the contrary, a downtrend would suggest miners might be dumping their Bitcoin. The other indicator is the famous &apos;Puell Multiple,&apos; a metric that tells us how profitable miners would be compared to the last year if they sold all their mined coins today. The Puell Multiple&apos;s value is calculated by taking the ratio between the daily value of issued coins and the 365-day moving average of it.

42394347,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvc93R,1639159296,What Intellectuals Still Don’t Get About Crypto,"“Yes, Web3 is a bunch of bullshit. The problem is, compared to what?”  That subhead to Matt Stoller’s newsletter this week set me off even more than the headline, which read, “Cryptocurrencies: a Necessary Scam?”  To be clear, my issue isn’t with the all-too-common grammatical slip in the comparative. (Hint: Matt, please review Shakespeare and the difference between “compare to” and “compare with.”)  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  No, what got me was the “yes” in Stoller’s statement. It was a wink to the intellectual elite, as if to say, “Don’t worry, it’s okay to acknowledge that those crazies in the crypto community, while possibly well-meaning in their critique of broken political-economic order, are, yes, Kool Aid-drinking cultists.”  It was especially galling because I’d been scheduled to join Stoller on Peter McCormack’s “What Bitcoin Did” podcast this past weekend, with a format that Stoller suggested we describe as “convince Matt Stoller.” Scheduling conflicts meant I couldn’t make it. I guess he remains unconvinced.  It also stung because I’m a big fan of Stoller, a leading light in the so-called Hipster Antitrust movement who is closely aligned with Lina Khan, chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission. Stoller’s book Goliath is a must read on why we must confront monopoly power to protect democracy and long-term prosperity. In so many other respects, his worldview aligns with mine. He’s a believer in free, open, competitive markets and, most importantly, that it’s necessary to prevent excessively powerful gatekeepers from manipulating and distorting those markets. In an age when dominating internet platforms have forged an insidiously destructive system of surveillance capitalism, Stoller’s writings – found in his BIG blog/newsletter – have done much to focus our attention on why society needs to act on this, now more than ever.  Where we clearly disagree is on whether cryptocurrencies and blockchain are a viable mechanism in the digital age for executing on that.  The story until now  Why do thoughtful, intelligent people like Matt Stoller have such a blind spot to crypto? On the surface, it might be because, like me, they find the money-grabbing excess of crypto speculation kind of gauche and annoying, a bit beneath us.  But, stepping back. I’d say it’s because even though they express interest in reforming our financial system, their minds are trapped – as we all are to differing degrees – in the meta-story of our system of money and power, the one that holds it all together. They fight from within that framework, not from outside of it, because they can’t imagine any other way.  Nearly all of what constitutes our system of governance – our agreed-upon mechanism for setting the rules of conduct and forging the trust needed to engage in exchanges of value – is a product of our collective imagination: religions, nation-states, corporations, money itself.  According to Israeli historian Yuval Harari, our ability to imagine such concepts, to collectively tell these “stories,” is what made civilization possible. They are necessary fictions, but fictions nonetheless. Before we can analyze whether cryptocurrencies constitute “real” value or not, we must first acknowledge that reality.  Not doing so is where Stoller sells himself short. In describing – and thereby dismissing – cryptocurrencies as “a social movement based on the belief that markings in a ledger on the internet have intrinsic value,” he loses sight of how that exact same description can be applied to all money.  As we’ve discussed in prior editions of this column, the essence of money doesn’t lie in the thing we use to represent it – the gold coin, the banknote, the wampum – but in its function as a record-keeping device, the means by which society keeps track of everyone’s debit and credits and by which our debts to each other are cleared. Money is, quite literally, “markings in a ledger” – albeit one that now integrates bank account entries with the physical transfer of tokenized “counting tools” (coins and banknotes).  Also, we should note that in its currency form, money has no intrinsic value. Yet to function, it requires collective belief in its indisputable “value.” Because that unquestioned belief is necessary for it to fulfill its core record-keeping function, all money can quite reasonably be described as a “social movement.”  The challenge  It’s difficult to acknowledge that our existing systems of money and governance are socially constructed imaginings. It forces us to put a metaphorical asterisk next to concepts we otherwise take for granted as given realities. And until recently, there hasn’t been a compelling reason to question the dominant governance paradigm. For the past few centuries, the global economy has operated, unquestioned, within a framework of centralized institutions such as nation-state governments, media outlets and companies.  It’s hard for any competitor to that system to challenge something so entrenched as money or the nation-state. Such a change is almost unfathomably monumental. But governance paradigms do shift – think of the French Revolution or the U.S Declaration of Independence.  For any newly imagined competitor to those systems to claim legitimacy requires a serious challenge to the foundation of that belief system, a shift that renders the existing paradigm out of touch, and the new one – be it crypto or something else – as a viable alternative. For something as entrenched as money or the nation-state, such changes are rare. They are monumental by nature.  Yet that’s precisely what has happened. Over the past three decades, there has been a shock to our prevailing governance systems, mostly due to digital technology and new means of human interconnectivity.  Many in the intellectual class may not have noticed the change, or at least haven’t recognized how fundamental it is. And no doubt many would think it presumptuous for a mob of crypto fanatics to claim they alone have seen it. Regardless, the paradigm has most definitely shifted.  First, the internet  The change came, gradually, in two phases.  First, there was the arrival of the internet, which broke down the hierarchies determining who gets to produce, broadcast and receive information. It also allowed people to organize independently of geography. The idea of what constitutes a “community” or who gets to lead it was upended.  Well before crypto fanatics started crowing about “decentralization,” the internet was already decentralizing a vital part of modern civilization. That has fueled what former Central Intelligence Agency analyst Martin Gurri has described as the “revolt of the public,” a backlash against the elites behind the centralized institutions that dominated our global governance system throughout the 20th century.  Meanwhile, as the internet widened societal access to information and gave more and more people the capacity to produce and distribute information, it forged an entirely new, highly valuable commodity: the data we accumulate throughout our digital lives as we interact with those ever-expanding information access points. That created an opportunity for a few centralized internet platforms to become even more powerful than the institutions of the pre-internet era. They used network effects to their advantage, fostering dependencies on their services and gathering monopoly power of that data.  The problem was that in this flatter, democratized information exchange system, there was no governance model commensurate with its decentralized structure. There was no way to prove identities or to keep track of transactions (either of money or of data, that newly valuable commodity) in ways that all parties could trust. So we defaulted to the same old centralized structures we’d always relied upon.  Yet in the borderless world of the internet, everything was ill-defined. Where do the boundaries lie for jurisdictions, copyright, property, identity, etc.? There was no way for people to trustfully interact with each other on a purely peer-to-peer basis online. That left a breach into which stepped the likes of Amazon, Facebook and Google et al. to act as our intermediating gatekeepers. It thrust us into the worst-of-all-worlds solution of surveillance capitalism.  Then, crypto  Then along comes the other element of the paradigm shift: a brand new governance system for keeping track of data exchanges (of which money is just a subset), without requiring people to trust an adjudicating third-party ledger keeper to record and validate those transactions. It started with Bitcoin and then encompassed a variety of blockchain solutions within what has since become known as “crypto.” Now, we have a decentralized system for the internet of value to marry the decentralized internet of information..  Together, these changes make for a radical new way of both conducting and governing human interactions. They are no panacea to the domination of Big Tech, but they at least offer the potential for a new, Web 3 model of existence for our current age. They offer a vision of self-sovereign individuals in the digital realm.  At the very least, they demand that we question existing narratives.  I still might not be able to “convince Matt Stoller,” but perhaps if he and his ilk were more open-minded about why these new governance models are important, they might see less of a “bunch of bullshit” and more promise.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | WALLET,Michael J.

42411140,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gj7SnK,1639147948,Most Influential: Katie Haun,"After the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack, mainstream commentators wagged their fingers at bitcoin. Fortunately for the cryptocurrency community, it had a ready and credible defender in former prosecutor Katie Haun.  The Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) partner appeared as a voice of reason in the pages of The New York Times, explaining that crypto is helpful in ransomware investigations: It allowed law enforcement to retrieve the money extorted by Colonial Pipeline’s attackers unusually fast.  This article is part of CoinDesk’s “Most Influential 2021″ series. You can bid on the NFT of Katie Haun by Sasha Katz at SuperRare here. 20% of the sale will go to the charity Too Young to Wed.  “It is unprecedented that the Justice Department would be able to recover the proceeds from international criminal activity so quickly. That timeline is usually years, if ever,” Haun told the Gray Lady.  For such advocacy, not to mention her kingmaker role as co-chair of a16z’s new $2.2 billion crypto venture fund, Haun has secured a spot among CoinDesk’s Most Influential people in crypto for 2022. Her pedigree and gravitas are likely to become ever-more important in the year ahead as a showdown brews between regulators (not least of all U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler) and the industry’s biggest stakeholders (among whom a16z ranks prominently).  Haun’s career arc speaks to the gradual mainstreaming and legitimization of digital currencies. As a federal prosecutor, she investigated some of the darkest chapters of early cryptocurrency history, including the misconduct of federal agents handling the Silk Road case, the looting of Mt. Gox and the criminal case against BTC-e.  After 11 years at the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), she leveraged what she’d learned, joining crypto exchange Coinbase as a board member in 2017 and a16z as a general partner the following year.  Now Haun is helping to pump wads of cash into a selection of crypto startups. Launched in June 2021, a16z’s fund focuses on projects building crypto infrastructure and scalability tools, the “picks and shovels” of the space, as well as novel and popular fields of crypto like decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and gaming, Haun told The Times in June.  Far from harboring any cypherpunk dreams, Haun said that crypto is “desperate for regulators to say what the rules are.” While that may not be true of everyone in the field – there are still plenty who ignore or defy the law – it definitely describes startups that have become as big as mainstream financial companies can get, such as Coinbase, which went public this year. (Haun’s shares in the exchange were at one point reportedly worth $150 million.)  For such companies, Haun might be viewed as the quintessential convert: Unlike many of her peers in the U.S. regulatory and law enforcement agencies, she was quick to understand crypto and to see its promising future. (It’s no coincidence that a16z added former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) member Brian Quintenz and SEC veteran William Hinman to round out its regulatory team.)  Haun has continued to exercise her policy chops, co-authoring a proposed regulatory framework for stablecoins with two a16z colleagues, part of a broader push by the firm in 2021 to shape the crypto agenda in Washington.  ‘Never lost a case’  In retrospect, Haun’s first crypto-related assignment as an attorney at the DOJ was an impossible task.  It was 2012, and U.S. government agencies were just starting to grasp the technology. “My boss came in and said, ‘How would you like to prosecute this other new thing called bitcoin?’ I had never heard about it at the time,” she recalled in Jeff John Roberts’ book “Kings of Crypto.”  The potential “culprit” in her file, code named F-N-U L-N-U (“first name unknown, last name unknown”), was initially supposed to turn into some shadow puppet master who invented bitcoin to provide a money-laundering tool to the criminals of the world. Yet at the end, Haun concluded that bitcoin itself was not a crime.  “It’s like you would prosecute cash. It wasn’t something you could do,” she recalled.  Instead of loathing crypto, she started loving it for the transparency provided by the blockchain, or public ledger. Cryptocurrency transactions leave “digital breadcrumbs,” like no other money laundering tools, even bank wires, she told TechCrunch earlier this year. This allows investigators to follow the stolen or extorted money right from the crime scene to where they meet the fiat money world, often pointing at actual criminals cashing out.  View the SuperRare auction here.  The days when Haun was determining if she could “prosecute bitcoin” were also the earliest days of Coinbase. Back then, Haun paid a visit to the fledgling startup – years later, she would join its board, and that would lead to the latest turn in her career – becoming a partner at a16z.  When another a16z partner, Chris Dixon, met her thanks to both of them being on the Coinbase board, he saw her as a good fit for the venture capital firm and introduced her to co-founder Ben Horowitz.  Horowitz recalled to CNBC how he phoned Haun’s former supervisor at the DOJ and heard: “This woman has never lost a case – she takes more cases than anybody, and she takes the hardest cases. There’s nobody like Katie here.”  So now, instead of probing criminal activity, she’s investigating the best ways to put money into crypto, legally and for profit.  True believer  Unlike many crypto advocates, Haun sounds convincing when speaking of her faith in the future of concepts that are sometimes viewed as no more than a fleeting hype. This may be because she has been so consistent in her own crypto discovery journey, so her evolution from a prosecutor to a startup patron to a venture capital investor looks organic.  When she was a prosecutor, after Haun had to educate herself on the nature of crypto, she started educating her peers, launching training seminars on cryptocurrencies for the U.S. Treasury, IRS and other government agencies. Between leaving the government and joining the private sector, she ended up teaching a class on crypto and cybercrime at Stanford Graduate School of Business.  Beyond the hype, she believes there is a serious adoption-boosting side to things like NFTs. “It’s about this new business model for creators and bringing entirely new audiences to crypto, entirely new types like creators, sports fans and media types,” she said in The Times interview.  Another thing Haun (and a16z, through her) might be signalling about the future institutional adoption of crypto is that big money is warming up to token sales – again. However, unlike the initial coin offering (ICO) craze of 2017, now is the time for a meticulous approach, she told TechCrunch, adding that the majority of a16z’s funds are now deployed in crypto projects’ tokens.  Haun is leading a16z’s fund with fellow partners Chris Dixon, Arianna Simpson and Ali Yahya. To win Haun’s vote for an investment, these are some of the questions founders need to answer well:  “Has the team set aside enough tokens for the community? Once the protocol is live, what does that look like? Are they going to airdrop tokens? What’s their go-to-market strategy? Are they incentivizing early employees with tokens?”  Sounds like the expression “token economics” gains more weight when she uses it. And according to her, a16z is as serious as it can be about those tokens it buys.  As she said in another interview with TechCrunch: “We’re 7- to 10-year patient investors; we’re not running a crypto hedge fund.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/12/10/most-influential-katie-haun,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2eedba7a6d8a962adc23994a4a693fd45a3731bb-1440x1088.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The regulator wants to establish rules on how crypto trading should be conducted, according to a Bloomberg report Friday.  “What we want to be able to do is to intervene when we think that what is provided to potential customers are products that they don’t understand that are potentially highly risky,” FCSA commissioner Unathi Kamlana said.  The regulations, which will be unveiled early in 2022, are being brought forward in response to two major scams that defrauded investors of significant sums earlier this year.  In June, the founders of crypto investment firm Africrypt disappeared with around $3.6 billion of bitcoin. This followed the Mirror Trading International (MTI) scam that defrauded investors of some $589 million.  The FCSA is also aiming for its framework to address how crypto interacts with traditional finance products and balance sheets and the threat they may pose to financial stability.  Kamlana urged would-be crypto investors to “wait to see” how the Reserve Bank progresses on its work on a central bank digital currency.

42396362,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT2rAv,1639142630,Crypto’s Carbon Footprint Could Hinder Adoption: Deutsche Bank,"In the past three years bitcoin’s market cap has grown to more than $1 trillion from $70 billion, and its “annual global energy consumption increased nearly four times, to over 200 terawatt hours (TWh),” according to a research report by Deutsche Bank on the crypto industry’s sustainability issues.  While bitcoin’s environmental impact was hardly mentioned at the recent COP26 climate conference, it remains a key issue for crypto users, the bank said.  “Mining just one bitcoin consumes a larger carbon footprint than nearly 2 billion Visa transactions” and just one bitcoin transaction could power the average U.S. household for 61 days, analyst Marion Laboure wrote in the Dec. 9 note.  “Crypto’s carbon footprint could hinder adoption,” the bank said, noting that as of July 64% of sovereign-wealth funds had a policy covering environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues.  Private sector companies have also pledged to become carbon neutral, Deutsche Bank observed. In the public sector, 197 have signed up to the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit rising global temperatures to 2°C by cutting greenhouse-gas emissions. The bank cites one study that predicts bitcoin mining alone could lead to an increase of that amount in just three decades.  Due to the carbon footprint of mining operations, some governments and regulators, such as the Chinese, are taking action, the report said. But as the market value of cryptocurrencies expands “people will find a way to mine, trade and use cryptocurrencies, especially in an unregulated market.”  The bank sees a number of ways to approach the “decarbonization of cryptocurrencies,” including a move to renewable energy sources; disincentivizing carbon-fueled mining; a switch to proof-of-stake protocols from proof-of-work; or by pre-mining tokens.  At the moment, 76% of bitcoin’s global energy consumption comes from non-renewable sources like coal, the note said.

The IMF called for a “comprehensive, consistent and coordinated” approach in order to harness the benefits of crypto’s underlying technology while mitigating some of its risks, in a blog published on Thursday.  This will prove a “daunting task,” the IMF said. “But if we start now, we can achieve the policy goal of maintaining financial stability while benefiting from the benefits that the underlying technological innovations bring.”  According to the IMF, regulating crypto at a global level should have three core elements:  “Crypto-asset service providers that deliver critical functions should be licensed or authorized. These would include storage, transfer, settlement and custody of reserves and assets, among others, similar to existing rules for financial service providers.”  “Requirements should be tailored to the main use cases of crypto assets and stablecoins. For example, services and products for investments should have requirements similar to those of securities brokers and dealers, overseen by the securities regulator. Services and products for payments should have requirements similar to those of bank deposits, overseen by the central bank or the payments oversight authority.”  “Authorities should provide clear requirements on regulated financial institutions concerning their exposure to and engagement with crypto.”  Last month, the IMF warned of the increasing use of crypto in the developing world – something it referred to as “cryptoization” – which could destabilize economies and hamper central banks’ monetary policy.

The unstoppable cross-chain cloud computing protocol that allows users to deploy full-stack applications, decentralized apps (dApps), blockchain privatenets, and mainnet nodes, found a way to combine two of the hottest crypto topics: NFTs and DeCloud. The Node NFT Innovation NFTs have been the talk of the town for a while now in the crypto world. Their use cases are expanding from being digital collectible art to a crucial part of DeFi. But StackOS has conjured up an innovation that allows them to use NFTs to propel the cause of decentralization further into the mainstream. Nodes are an integral part of decentralization. They allow individuals to participate in decentralization and make it more powerful. But so far, in most projects, launching nodes has been a huge task that usually requires certain technical ability and a fair amount of capital. With the StackOS Node NFTs, all you need is $200 and a computer with an internet connection. You can now mint a Node NFT and immediately be a part of their decentralization network without any technical knowledge. A Node NFT will allow you to create a slot for a node that a cluster operator can use. The way StackOS operates is that there are multiple cluster operators around the world.

Polkadot (DOT) was trading at $27 during Asian trading hours, down 7% from Thursday’s peak of $30.16. Solana (SOL) fell 6.6% to $178, while terra (LUNA) traded at $69.43, down 8% from Thursday’s $76.72 high.  The solana price drop was partly driven by a congestion problem on the Solana network on Thursday that caused its transaction-processing speed to slow down, CoinDesk reported.  Some expect solana’s decline to continue until a major support level is reached. “SOL/USD is heading toward the $145 daily support level,” said Phil Gunwhy, chief marketing officer at Solana-based lending platform Blockasset. “There is not much substantial support along the way until that mark, only the $155.5 daily level which does not look overly convincing in terms of its potential motive force.”  Meanwhile, fundamentals remain strong for large-cap altcoins polkadot and terra, which is the native token of the Luna network. Polkadot’s much-awaited “parachain” feature went live last month, allowing investors and the community to lock up DOT tokens in an auction for the tokens of other blockchains that build atop the main Polkadot blockchain.  As for Luna, according to data from tracking tool DeFi Llama, decentralized finance (DeFi) apps have locked up over $13 billion worth of LUNA and other Terra-based assets like UST on the Luna blockchain. The tokens’ fundamentals were further strengthened by a token-burning mechanism that went live in November.  Meme coins see smaller declines than layer 1 blockchains  Meme coins like dogecoin and shiba inu saw relatively smaller declines. Dogecoin fell 3.7% and shiba inu dropped 4%. Meanwhile, coins associated with Ethereum competitors Algorand and Cardano fell 4.8% and 6.2% respectively. Avalanche, the token for another layer 1 network, fell 3.4% at press time.  The tokens of popular Ethereum mainstays like decentralized exchange Uniswap (UNI) and metaverse game Axie Infinity (AXS) were among the other big losers during Asian trading hours, dropping as much 9% from Thursday highs.  The declines were primarily technically driven and followed those of bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, which fell to a low of $47,440 from Thursday’s high of $50,910.  Global risk assets like bitcoin declined on Thursday morning shortly after rating agency Fitch downgraded Evergrande, a Chinese real estate conglomerate with an estimated $300 billion in obligations. Fitch said Evergrande had defaulted and wouldn’t repay its investors, sparking fears of an imminent sell-off in other markets.

Trading volume in the bitcoin-Turkish lira currency pair on crypto exchange Binance totaled $918 million in November, less than a fifth the level of the shiba inu-lira value of $5.26 billion and tether-lira’s $5.58 billion.  “The data shows despite the instability faced by the lira, local traders are still attracted to the exceptional returns associated with coins such as SHIB,” Strahinja Savic, head of data and analytics at Toronto-based crypto platform FRNT Financial, said in an email.  CoinDesk reached out to BTCTurk, one of a handful of local exchanges offering lira-BTC trades for comment, but has not received a response.  In November, the lira crashed nearly 40% against the dollar after the central bank cut interest rates even as inflation topped 20% and the U.S. Federal Reserve began tapering its liquidity-boosting, asset-purchase program. The currency has depreciated 87% this year and is on track to register its ninth straight annual drop.  “The official inflation figure is 21%, but at the ground level, it is more like 50%,” Sabri Aygun, a textile professional and crypto investor from Istanbul, told CoinDesk in a WhatsApp chat.  Demand for almost everything priced in the local currency, including gold, picks up in such situations.  “Turkish citizens’ priority is gold and dollar,” Aygun said. “They also buy cheap crypto coins like SHIB, VET, XRP because BTC is expensive.”  SHIB, with its massive supply of 1 quadrillion tokens, is exceptionally cheap compared with major coins. SHIB/TRY was trading near 0.00049 liras on Binance at press time while BTC/TRY was changing hands at 686,580 liras.  While crypto payments are banned in Turkey, owning crypto is legal. However, the growing popularity of tether and other cryptocurrencies may draw regulatory ire, as increased capital flight through these non-banking channels could add to the lira’s pain.  The attraction of cheap altcoins isn’t limited to Turkey. Retail investors in India and elsewhere are looking to SHIB and other smaller coins as leverage plays on bitcoin. Shiba inu, the self-proclaimed dogecoin killer, has rallied nearly 380% in dollar terms this quarter. Meanwhile, bitcoin has gained just 8%, according to TradingView.  According to FRNT’s Savic, traders in Turkey could be using tether as a proxy for dollar exposure. Tether, the world’s largest stablecoin by market value, is supposedly backed by a basket of reserves and holds a 1:1 peg to the dollar. It’s widely considered a digital representation of the dollar that can be moved freely across exchanges and national borders, bypassing traditional banking channels.  “I hold USDT because sending USDT is fast and cheap across different exchanges, also swapping between spot and futures,” said Ercan Bozoglu, a crypto investor from Turkey who is based in the Netherlands. “Turks are mainly on cheap alternative cryptocurrencies, so they take profit at 2x and redraw (less fee cost).”  Aygun said the young generation is more interested in crypto than gold and USD, but is financially dependent on family, a fact confirmed by another local trader who said, “my father won’t let me buy crypto.”",NEUTRAL,BTC | SHIB | USDT,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | SHIB | USDT,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/10/tether-shib-compete-with-bitcoin-in-inflation-ridden-turkey-as-lira-tumbles,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d7c87d7a4f94d068d98ffa661197e02399dcd3a-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Since flocks of miners from China and beyond soaked up Kazakhstan’s spare energy capacity, the government has been dealing with severe electricity shortages.  The government proposed a limit to the development of new mines of a total of 100 megawatts (MW) nationwide in October, setting an upper boundary for the potential of crypto mining growth in Kazakhstan.  Read more: Kazakhstan’s Crypto Miners Face New Regulations After Contributing to Power Shortages  Kazakh miner Didar Bekbauov of Xive said his company is planning to visit the U.S. next year to look into developing mines there.  To deal with electricity rationing, mining platform BitFuFu simply turned off its machines in Kazakhstan, left them there, and is setting up new ones in the U.S.  Bekbauov said that he thinks the regulatory environment in some U.S. states is conducive to his business and that it is unlikely his company will be subject to the treatment it had received from Kazakh authorities.  Rusinovich said that Russia’s excess capacity and diverse energy sources are a great opportunity for miners. He said that there is some geopolitical risk associated with doing business there, but that miners who follow the right procedures and establish themselves are unlikely to face unfair treatment from the government.  Broken promises  Kazakhstan’s national grid operator Kegoc (Kazakhstan Electricity Grid Operating Co.) started rationing power to mines in September. One tactic several miners mentioned was that Kegoc would shut power off to crypto mines during peak demand hours so that cities could have adequate electricity.  After protests from the industry, the minister of energy said in November that the government wouldn’t cut power to legally operating mines.  But the government quickly broke that promise. Industry sources estimate that between 200 MW and 500 MW of lawfully operating mines had their power cut off, including some of Kazakhstan’s most established operations.  Later in November, Bekbauov shut down a 2,500-rig mine in southern Kazakhstan that was operating legally because of insufficient electricity, he told CoinDesk.  Despite the regulatory limitations, not all Kazakh miners have abandoned hope. Some think that if failing power plants come back online, Kegoc’s electricity rationing policy will improve. Others hope that if they develop their own renewable energy capacity, they will be able to start to grow again.

Rainmaker Guild Ltd. on Thursday said it raised $6.5 million in a seed funding round that was anchored by Alameda Research, Animoca Brands and CoinFund as venture capital firms rush in to fund what they hope will be the next Axie Infinity, a blockchain-based video game that has been a hit.  Few have been able to replicate Axie’s success this year. Rainmaker Games is betting on becoming a central P2E gateway by wooing players, training them for the big time and then connecting them with guilds.  Seed investors are taking 4% of all RAIN tokens. That would give Rainmaker Games, which hasn’t launched yet, a market cap of around $162 million. Play-to-earn games such as Axie, which requires an expensive non-fungible token to access, can command multibillion-dollar market caps.  A flood of first-time players keeps raising the floor price of those NFTs, giving rise to “guilds” that buy the NFTs and share access with their users. Rainmaker started as a guild, according to CEO Will Deane. It’s now angling to be something closer to a talent agency and training gym.  “We’re gonna help you train and level up to get guild-verified or game-verified,” Deane said in a call. Lower-tier first-timers will start out doing tasks that “go through the motions” until they improve to a point where they can start playing to earn.  “If you score on the low percentile, then you get to go to our training center and level up. As you level up you become more appetizing to guilds and games,” he said. Strong gamers will climb into prime positions for guild recruitment.  Players will eventually be able to sell or loan their NFTs on a Rainmaker marketplace, according to the project’s profile on Polkastarter.",POSITIVE,없음,AXS | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/12/10/play-to-earn-platform-rainmaker-nabs-65m-seed-round,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dc791cc20da6cffdd8689453d450740cbf892954-4229x2819.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396378,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT2vNe,1639096318,"Solana Validators, Engineers Grapple With Blockchain Slowdown on Public Call","Solana’s superfast blockchain slowed to a relative crawl Thursday morning due to a mysterious congestion event that spurred debates about centralization, communication and transparency at the ecosystem’s critical stakeholder, Solana Labs.  Those tensions were on display midday after validators, peeved by slowdowns to Solana’s claimed Nasdaq-like speed, joined an impromptu roundtable. The problem was simple: A network that usually processes more than 2,000 transactions per second was stumbling along at speeds below 500. (Ethereum processes around 15 transactions per second.)  The issues had been mostly resolved by Thursday evening, but not before about 35 community members attended a public video chat, including a CoinDesk reporter and at least two Solana Labs engineers.  Solana’s 1,000-plus validators are the computing power behind a nearly $12 billion ecosystem of lending, trading and other decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. Only a handful of them came to Thursday’s call. They weren’t happy.  The 50-minute conversation started with tough questions – Could Solana benefit from a centralized observation system? – ended with a surreal one – Can the next breakpoint be staged on yachts in the Mediterranean? – and left unanswered what exactly would happen next.  Read more: Solana Throws a Three-Day Party for Itself  “All of the apps running on top of Solana are the customers of the validators, right?” Brian Long, who operates the data site Validators.app and who convened the call, told the roundtable. “It’s just super urgent that we get this sorted out.”  Failing to do so could stunt the growth of a burgeoning financial system.  Daffy Durairaj, co-founder of popular Solana-based trading service Mango Markets, said Solana’s past outages have been pain points for the decentralized exchange’s outreach efforts.  “I’m trying to bring in these market-makers and traders and whatnot,” he said. “They just lose a lot of confidence when the nodes go down, and then they don’t know why.”  Past problems  Solana suffered an 18-hour outage in September that was resolved only after a hard restart. Thursday’s event, which was not an outage, was nowhere near as severe.  Still, it provided some validators a chance to air grievances to Solana Labs engineers.  They asked why the startup that has been critical to Solana’s development and that continues to be an omnipresent force in its growth remained so tight-lipped about the goings-on of an ecosystem that is supposed to be decentralized.  “We see the GitHub changes,” said the pseudonymous Zantetsu of the validator Shinobi Systems, who commanded much of Thursday’s conversation. “But, man, it just feels like a big black hole.”  Dan Albert, executive director of the Solana Foundation, denied that the project keeps unflattering information under wraps. But he acknowledged a “conservative stance” toward sharing sensitive details that Solana’s critics could spin against the network.  “The tech is hard, and I want you guys, really invested community members, to continue to feel ownership and feel like you’re being engaged by the developers and those who are working behind the scenes,” Albert said.  Read more: Grayscale Launches New Trust Dedicated to Solana  Behind the scenes, there’s “a fair bit of chaos,” Will Hickey, one of Solana Labs’ newest engineers, said on the call.  “My impression in my first three weeks is that there’s a fair bit of chaos,” Hickey said. “The amount of chaos that you might expect within a startup, but maybe an amount of chaos that’s a bit scary, given how much the Solana ecosystem has grown in the last year.”  Lingering questions  Although there was no clear reason for the slowdown, which had mostly resolved by Thursday evening, a handful of voices seemed comfortable with at least experimenting with a new layer of centralization that would aim to give Solana Labs more insight into the network.  Hickey polled the room on an “observability system.” He acknowledged such a system would be centralized by design. He said it could help the engineers pinpoint problems and prepare patches faster.  The room was skeptical but not to a fault. It would have to be a voluntary system, Zantestu said. Validators.app’s Long agreed. Solana Labs couldn’t mandate such a system without pushback.  “The crazy thing is we need them as a part of this effort, though, right? They have the insight to help us figure out where we’re going to pull the metrics from. They have the skill required to actually write the code without effing it up. And so we’ll have to pull them in at some point,” Long said.
