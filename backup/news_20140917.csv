42397941,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEiVP,1410989747,Koinify Raises $1 Million for Smart Corporation Crowdfunding Platform,"Koinify has raised $1 million to further develop its decentralized application crowdfunding platform.  The platform will enable the creation of smart corporations – also known as decentralized autonomous corporations (DACs) – and decentralized applications (DApps). Upon launch, investors will be able to use Koinify to buy tokens associated with various projects using bitcoin.  The round included participants such as IDG Capital Partners, Brock Pierce's AngelList syndicate and zPark Ventures. With the new round completed, the company has raised roughly $1.4m to date, including seed funding from Sequoia China.  Tom Ding, CEO and founder of Koinify, said that the money will be used to both develop the platform and promote the broader concept of decentralized companies and applications.  Ding commented:  “The extra funding will primarily be used to continue development of a secure and extremely user friendly funding platform, as well as to evangelize decentralized application development.”  Pierce, whose AngelList syndicate recently topped $1m in investor funding, lauded both the company's leader and its concept. Ding has notably worked as a product manager for eBay and as an online marketing specialist for Alibaba.  “Right model. Right time,” Pierce added.  Funding channels decentralized  Koinify seeks to provide the financial backbone for one of the more nascent areas of the bitcoin economy, namely decentralized platforms and entities that, according to some, constitute crypto 2.0.  Decentralized projects can use the platform to raise funds, allowing developers to circumvent an environment ill-suited for startups that lack wealthy backers or industry connections.  Yet, beyond financial considerations, Koinify wants to provide an ecosystem for decentralized entities to access funding and build a whole new economic infrastructure from the ground up.  As Ding noted:  “We have always been looking for really ambitious and radical ideas to disrupt the inefficient legacy system. The block chain and smart contract technology allows developers to essentially replace the classic hundred year old corporate monopoly with lines of code.”  Koinify’s upcoming platform is one side of the broader decentralized crowdfunding movement. Other platforms, including Bitcoin Core developer Mike Hearn’s Lighthouse, focus on bitcoin-centric projects that are short on funding.

42397937,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEiRT,1410988214,Banking Crackdown Dominates Day One of Isle of Man Bitcoin Conference,"Crypto Valley Summit, a two-day conference aimed at launching the Isle of Man as a prime location for bitcoin businesses, kicked off today in the wake of news that threatened to undermine its central goal.  Just one day before the conference of more than 200 attendees began, a firm providing banking facilities to bitcoin businesses on the island announced it would close those accounts under pressure from its partner banks.  Still, the event was opened resiliently by the Isle of Man's Lieutenant Governor, Adam Woodhttps://www.gov.im/about-the-government/offices/cabinet-office/external-relations/crown-services/biography-of-lieutenant-governor/, who extolled the island's ability to take advantage of a rising interest in digital currencies.  Wood said:  ""The rapid development of digital currencies is leaving legislators and regulators playing catch-up. This is where the Isle of Man's small size works to its advantage. It's agile and we can make an appropriate response in record time.""  Banking woes  A panel on banking garnered the most attention, as R Paul Davis, the most visible digital currency proponent on the island, decried the banks' decision to cut ties with domestic bitcoin businesses.  Davis addressed the crowd and this most recent news head on, saying:  ""HSBC closed CTS' corporate accounts because it objected to bitcoin transactions flowing through it.""  Davis went on to state that banks like Barclays were invited to speak at the event, but demurred following ""national discussions"". Davis also announced that a merchant services firm based in the US called Instabill would pick up the slack from CTS' account closures.  He added:  ""[Instabill] would be able to fairly quickly replace everything CTS is offering with the exception of UK Faster Payments. I have warned [Instabill's CEO] that his only real danger is being killed in the rush.""  Davis also offered his predictions on which banks would recognise the opportunity in digital currencies, and which would fall behind, asserting that Spanish megabank Santander would be first to capitalise on cryptocurrency given its exposure to Latin American markets where remittances and online payments are in demand.  He said banks like HSBC and Barclays, which have faced recent sanctions from regulators, would be last.  Regulatory issues  The regulatory panel, which included David Hodgson, deputy director for authorisations at the island's financial regulator, the Financial Supervision Commission, was largely positive on the development of digital currencies on the island.  ""My view is that where the Isle of Man government has decided to place itself, bringing in the AML [anti-money laundering] regulations is appropriate,"" Hodgson said, referring to the island's requirement that digital currency firms have to register with the FSC for AML oversight.  John Spellman, the island's director of financial services, likened digital currencies at present to earlier payment systems, which met with initial resistance before widespread adoption.  Drawing comparison to debit cards, Spellman said:  ""The idea of validating yourself with a PIN was bizarre. I see digital currencies as being in the same place.""  Gaming and crowdfunding  Simon Dixon  , of Bank to the Future, talked up the Isle of Man's potential to become a prime location for bitcoin firms on a panel he shared with Max Keiser, host of the television programme The Keiser Report.  Dixon threw jabs at London and rival offshore jurisdiction Jersey:  ""This is the ideal jurisdiction to disrupt the [banking] market. The jurisdiction that will win is not London [... and] despite the fact that Jersey reactionarily came along after the Isle of Man, it is a banking island, I think there will be a lot of politics involved with a new form of finance.""  The Isle of Man has a large online gambling industry, comprising about 10% of its gross domestic product. Firms like online poker giant Pokerstars are based on the island.  Panellists on the session on gaming and cryptocurrencies welcomed the greater adoption of digital currency globally, with one panellist noting that cryptocurrencies could potentially offer greater profit margins to gaming operators.  On the sidelines, investor Brock Pierce, who is a co-founder of Isle of Man-based GoCoin, was effusive in his praise for the event.  Pierce's remarks captured the optimism of the event:  ""It's so refreshing hearing from government officials and regulators who are positive about digital currencies. The Isle of Man is the centre of the bitcoin universe now.""

42397933,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEiMY,1410986112,Medical Marijuana Dispensary Becomes Canada’s First to Accept Bitcoin,"Mega Chill has become the first medical marijuana dispensary in Canada to accept bitcoin.  Since the formal announcement this September, Mega Chill has seen an overwhelmingly positive response from the community, both from patients familiar with bitcoin and customers who had never heard of the digital currency.  The relationship between bitcoin and the marijuana industry is long-standing due to bitcoin's ability to offer an alternative to the traditional banking system and its still-prevalent use in online dark markets.  In the case of Mega Chill, however, the decision had less to do with sidestepping potential money problems and more to do with the growing popularity of bitcoin as a payment method. CoinDesk spoke with co-owner Matt Jung, who cited the public’s curiosity and enthusiasm for digital currency as the reason his business decided to accept bitcoin.  Jung said customers have begun using bitcoin regularly since Mega Chill started accepting it, telling CoinDesk:  “It’s been really good for our patients. One girl who comes in gets paid in bitcoin, so it’s perfect for her.”  Notably, the company manages its own bitcoin wallet rather than using a payments processor.  Ideal bitcoin merchant  For some, Mega Chill represents the ideal merchant for bitcoin – a business that is a relative newcomer to the technology but still sees the benefits of accepting it.  Jung told CoinDesk that Mega Chill, like other small businesses, is responding to grassroots support for the technology. He added his belief that bitcoin is an easy-to-use payment method and that the public ledger makes record-keeping simple as well.  Jung explained:  “It’s an interesting new step to take – a new emerging technology. It’s always good to have another payment method, to have more options for everybody.”  He added that from a financial management standpoint, bitcoin has helped reduced some of the friction Mega Chill facesas a marijuana business, including the hurdles it experienced when dealing with either card issuers or banking institutions.  “It eliminates a lot of the complications of dealing with the banks and dealing with the credit card companies,” Jung said.  Marijuana and digital currency  Some observers have pointed to bitcoin as potential boon for businesses in the marijuana space. Several altcoins exist, like potcoin and cannabiscoin, that seek to apply block chain technology to a marijuana-specific digital currency.  In some ways, the regulatory environment for bitcoin mirrors the situation currently facing the marijuana industry. Some of the associated risks and challenges, including restricted access to banking partners and a regulatory framework subject to change by federal regulators, are shared by both communities.  Still, US-based bitcoin merchant processors have been reluctant to support the marijuana industry. BitPay, for example, will not work with any of the industry's merchants given that the drug is illegal under federal law.  Ultimately, it may be business-by-business integrations like Mega Chill’s that help bitcoin proliferate in an industry in need of financial tools. Beyond the dispensary, the co-owners of Mega Chill plan on accepting bitcoin at the pizzeria next door, Mega ILL Pizzeria, once it reopens for business later this year.

42397940,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEiUQ,1410983106,"Coinbase Launches Toshi, a Free Bitcoin API for Developers","Coinbase has released Toshi, a free API toolkit for bitcoin app developers that runs on a full bitcoin node backed by a SQL database.  With the initial launch, Coinbase joins a growing number of bitcoin companies seeking to provide friendly APIs for app developers, including the Boost VC-backed BlockCypher, Barry Silbert-funded Chain and newly capitalized Gem.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong framed his company's latest offering as a boon for developers who will be able to build web applications and businesses on a free, hosted version of Toshi.  Armstrong told CoinDesk:  ""[Toshi] essentially gives away the technology behind Chain, BlockCypher, etc for free.""  BlockCypher, CEX.io, Chain and Gem are all notably offering similar services to developers free of charge, though Chain and Gem have indicated that they intend to charge enterprise customers for their products at scale.  This sector of the digital currency startup space has been increasingly active in recent days, with Gem closing a $2m seed round today, and CEX.io releasing the beta version of its PlugChain API just yesterday.  Building on bitcoin's core  Described as a complete implementation of the Bitcoin protocol, Toshi enables developers to better retrieve information about the latest blocks, network transactions and particular addresses on the network through access to Toshi API endpoints.  The implementation is written in Ruby and backed by PostgreSQL, factors which Coinbase suggests make it best for building web applications or analyzing block chain data. The company asserts that Toshi requires more storage space than Bitcoin Core, but that, as a result, it runs richer queries.  However, the website suggests that Toshi is still not ready for use in production.  The service's official GitHub reads:  ""It is currently in beta, and not recommended for production use until it has received sufficient testing from the bitcoin community.""  For more details on Toshi and its capabilities, visit GitHubhttps://github.com/coinbase/toshi/.  Investor approval  Noted VC entrepreneur and Coinbase investor Fred Wilson took to his personal blog to commend Coinbase on the launch of Toshi, citing it as a valuable tool for developers who face real challenges building solutions on Bitcoin Core.  Wilson framed Toshi as a way for Coinbase to extend its two years of expertise working with Bitcoin Core to younger developers, writing:  ""They are now making all of that technology available to developers who want to build bitcoin applications but don’t want to get knee deep in the Bitcoin Core.""  Further, Wilson acknowledged the increasing activity in the bitcoin development space, adding:  ""I think making bitcoin easier for developers is a big thing and I’m pleased to see Coinbase doing exactly that.""

42397924,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEiFf,1410979207,Instabill Extends Banking Lifeline to Isle of Man Bitcoin Startups,"Instabill has announced that it will offer merchant and banking accounts to companies working in the Isle of Man's digital currency industry.  The news comes just one day after Capital Treasury Services, a company that connects digital currency companies to banks on the Isle of Man, moved broadly to close the accounts of clients dealing in cryptocurrency, under pressure from partner banks.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Instabill founder Jason Field said his firm will be able to offer stable banking relationships to digital currency firms because it works with banks in various jurisdictions.  Field told CoinDesk:  ""We work with banks located in Europe, Asia and North America. We are not just working with one acquiring bank or operating out of one jurisdiction.""  Field would not say which banks his firm works with, but did say he has discussed the possibility of opening accounts for bitcoin businesses with Instabill's current banking providers.  ""We have had multiple discussions with our acquiring banks, they understand the business and they are interested in entering and facilitating processing solutions,"" he said.  The announcement coincides with Field's visit to the Crypto Valley Summit, a two-day confab on the Isle of Man that was meant to call attention to the Crown dependancy's favorable policies to the industry as well as the wide support from the bitcoin industry the island has received.  Startup launch scuppered  Despite the emergence of a new banking option, the conference threatened to be overshadowed by the news that CTS was cutting off banking facilities for the cryptocurrency firms currently based on the island.  One startup that recently incorporated on the island with an account with CTS is AltXE, which aims to become a payment processor for merchants along the lines of BitPay and Coinbase. Its co-founders Chris Wood and James Carter, had planned to launch the service at the conference, but hours before it was due to start, they were notified by CTS that that it would be closing bitcoin-related accounts in two weeks.  Carter said:  ""The plan was to tell people about [the startup] today. But CTS pulled out and it has really been disappointing. We spent [eight months] talking to various jurisdictions.""  Carter and Wood, based in Manchester, say they will be exploring the option of using Instabill now that their business can't proceed with CTS. They will delay their startup's launch, as well.  Terms of service  Instabill is a New Hampshire-based company that offers merchant account services to high-risk companies. This includes setting up credit card processing facilities for its customers, including debt collectors, dating websites and travel agencies.  A representative from Instabill told CoinDesk that the price of its service varies by industry, but that there's an initial $499 set-up fee due on approval for new accounts. To accept payments, digital currency merchants would need to pay a 3%–4% discount rate, plus approximately 35 cents per transaction.  Instabill allows merchants to accept major credit cards including China Union Pay, MasterCard and Visa, and its payment gateway supports 160 currencies.  Additionally, 10% of payment processing revenues are placed in a rolling reserve fund for the first six months. Customers then receive this 10% back each month beginning on month seven of the service. Instabill indicates that, while not a feature of many US banks, this money is necessary to cover contingencies, such as chargebacks and refunds.  Details aside, Field says digital currency firms on the island are rushing to find out what he can offer them:  ""We've already had half a dozen companies approach us in the last half hour. They're all digital currency businesses.""  Correction: A previous version of this article stated that digital currency merchants would need to pay 6% discount rate, plus 50 cents per transaction in Instabill service fees.

42397935,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEiOW,1410973679,How Bitcoin's Banking Crunch is Holding Back US Startups,"Following its May launch, QuickCoin captured attention with its novel integration of Facebook's ubiquitous social media platform and simple bitcoin wallet technology – and the wider tech world took notice.  Soon, the self-funded company began to capitalize on its momentum, and on 11th August, QuickCoin had the first of its seed round capital wired to its corporate bank account at Wells Fargo. The celebration, however, was short-lived.  As CEO Nathan Lands told CoinDesk:  ""Everything seemed fine, when all of a sudden I started noticing that some of our bills were bouncing because the debit card was being declined.""  Lands alleges that weeks of uncertainty ensued, and that in the end, QuickCoin's bank account was closed. Lands claims he was never issued a formal letter regarding account closure, although CoinDesk did confirm that transactions made via QuickCoin's account were denied.  The result is that ultimately, the San Francisco-based company was forced to explore other options, including looking offshore, for its banking needs. QuickCoin claims it now has a working solution in place for its banking needs and that its team is making plans for the longer term.  Wells Fargo would not comment on QuickCoin's case, citing confidentiality.  Lands, however, asserts that his story is not unique, framing it as indicative of a broad failure in the US banking system to accommodate the bitcoin industry and companies like his own that want to support domestic businesses.  What may be most interesting about Lands' case, however, is what he learned when he went searching for answers to his banking issues.  Behind closed doors  In emails provided to CoinDesk, Lands gave evidence that some of the ecosystem's most notable investors acknowledge in private that US startups are facing severe difficulties gaining access to banking partnerships, and that few solutions to this problem exist.  One prominent bitcoin company founder suggested that QuickCoin should ""burn through a couple smaller banks"" before finding a stable partnership.  He advised Lands:  ""[Don't] tell them what you do until they find out, which buys you a few months.""  The CEO, who wished to remain unnamed, said he would be willing to assist QuickCoin, but that the help would not be free.  ""Banks are all shutting off bitcoin companies. If I can find one, will let you know,"" another investor wrote.  Industry-wide issue  CoinDesk reached out to a number of the investors and businesses to discuss Lands' experience and the wider issue, with all acknowledging its existence. Further, there was widespread agreement on the situation – that few banks are willing to work with bitcoin companies and that, for a time being, a small stable of big-name VCs are key to striking partnerships.  The result, according to Coinsetter CEO Jaron Lukasiewicz, is that bitcoin startups are increasingly divided into the ""haves and have nots"".  He told CoinDesk:  ""With banks, there are three camps. One is banks who are completely not open to bitcoin, that's the majority. Then you have a small tier of fairly well-known banks that are not working with bitcoin companies, but they reach out and say 'We'll get there', and that's pending licensing. Then, there are a very small number of banks that will bank a company like ours.""  Investor Bill Tai, who has backed bitcoin mining startup BitFury, told CoinDesk he believes there is a broad bias against bitcoin companies.  ""Most of the major banks have set policy to suspend operations with bitcoin-related companies until they understand it all better,"" he said.  The VC advantage  Statements from the ecosystem's most prominent investors suggest that they understand their value in the market, but that the current situation poses challenges for their firms.  For example, Bitcoin Foundation board member Brock Pierce's AngelList syndicate had pledged to invest in 12 bitcoin startups in 2014, but has to date invested in just two. He provided anecdotal evidence of just how rare stable banking is for startups, telling CoinDesk:  ""If someone comes to me and says 'We have a banking relationships, we have ACH facilities', my immediate reaction would be I'm interested in it, because it's so difficult.""  Vinny Lingham, bitcoin enthusiast and CEO of mobile gift card provider Gyft, explained that, in his personal view, the current environment favors bitcoin companies backed by leading VC firms.  The result is that Lingham framed the current bitcoin ecosystem as anti-competitive. Companies like Circle, Coinbase and Xapo that can raise the requisite funds to establish relationships, he said, can now push out smaller entrepreneurs, a sentiment echoed by Tai.  Further, Lands' personal story provides evidence of this bias. In the weeks that followed his firm's account closure, Lands claims he met with several banks and credit unions, all of which denied QuickCoin services.  ""Most of them would ask us 'Who is your VC?', as if this was a requirement to have a bank account,"" said Lands, who is backed by a group of smaller investors.  Problems go beyond bitcoin  Members of bitcoin's investment community took a more realistic view of the situation, framing the frustrations of smaller startups as an understandable, and necessary, part of the ecosystem's larger growth.  SecondMarket chairman Barry Silbert, who has invested in more than 30 bitcoin companies personally and through his venture fund Bitcoin Opportunity Corp, expressed his wish that more bitcoin companies could get access to banking. However, he acknowledged that the ecosystem has developed a ""Tale of Two Cities situation"" where startups with name-brand investors are securing banking partnerships.  Silbert, however, chooses to focus on the positive implications of this development, telling CoinDesk:  ""I'd rather see the banks get really comfortable with a subset of companies first and building their own process and knowledge to manage that relationship and then expand from there, versus them not banking anybody.""  Pierce, too, suggested that far from controversial, these decisions make economic sense for banks.  ""We get excited about our $1m revenue numbers, but from a bank's perspective, it's a miniscule amount of business. I'm not surprised they're moving slowly,"" he said.  Silbert and Pierce both asserted that companies with less risky business models were also becoming favored in the US. These include products and services built on top of the block chain infrastructure and that don't handle customer money.  Lukasiewicz suggested, however, that this bias only extends to certain types of money, mainly smaller transactions from consumers, adding:  ""A lot of banks want to work with business-to-business transactions. When it comes to consumer-facing transactions, our bank has basically said we're not interested in that business.""  Bank reluctance tied to regulation  Many of the experts CoinDesk spoke to, particularly more experienced VCs, were quick to caution that banks are in the process of learning about bitcoin. They noted that, while many aren't yet involved in the ecosystem, they are aware of the increasing number of merchants active in the space, as well as the potential, long-term business bitcoin could bring.  Wells Fargo told CoinDesk it is ""learning more about virtual currencies and the potential rewards and risks.""  Still, other commentators framed the banking industry's reluctance as due to regulatory factors.  Public statements  by at least one smaller bank, Washington-based Peninsula Credit Union, support this notion, illustrating the considerations a wide number of smaller US banks may be making when approached by bitcoin businesses.  CEO Jim Morrell affirmed to CoinDesk that his company will not accept bitcoin businesses, because his firm doesn't work with any MSBs due to the extensive guidance his company would have to follow and the risk it would incur.  ""It's not the concern about doing more work. That's where the decision-making comes down, is this an area we want to pursue right now? At this point, we don't have the strategic direction from our board to do that,"" he said.  Finding refuge overseas  Though recent news stories suggest otherwise, there is a broad perception that bitcoin businesses are better off banking abroad.  Pierce painted European countries as more favorable to bitcoin businesses, citing his past experience.  Silbert added that, while he is confident in the emerging market businesses he's invested in, some of those startups worry about their long-term ability to do business.  ""A number of them have one relationship and only one relationship. They're certainly always concerned about the risk that one day they're going to get a phone call and they're going to lose that relationship.""  Further, Silbert suggested that any advantage bitcoin companies have abroad may only be temporary.  ""I would expect that some of these companies have banking relationships where the higher-ups of that bank either don't know that they have companies playing in the bitcoin space, or even don't know what bitcoin is, and frankly, that's what happened in the US,"" he added.  Time and persistence  Despite the challenges US bitcoin startups are facing, VCs agree that bitcoin's banking situation in the US remains a short-term problem.  Pierce is optimistic, concluding that persistence is the only path forward:  ""If you go talk to hundreds of banks, you'll find banks that will experiment with you. A lot of guys, when you knock on 10 doors, you give up.""  Lukasiewicz echoed those sentiments, noting that his company's funding and banking partnerships are a product of his own hard work and good fortune.  He suggested that, in retrospect, the trial by endurance he faced was successful at ensuring only the strongest companies survived. He recalled:  ""Every step of the way somebody's been telling me someone's going to make a big announcement. I've heard this for so long. You meet them at the conferences, they come in and they start trying to raise funds and they can't do it, then they realize how difficult the banking situation is, then they say 'This is really hard let's go on to the next thing'.""  Silbert believes this bottleneck won't last much longer. He highlighted how the major banks and investors he speaks with are increasingly positive about bitcoin, and went so far as to describe a future scenario where banks will compete to be the most bitcoin-friendly business.  However, the question remains, when will this interest translate into action and how many entrepreneurs will be deterred along the way?  Lingham said:  ""In the short term, the hurdle is very high, medium term the level will drop, and long term [the banks will] all accept bitcoin because they have to. How long is the short term? I don't know.""

42397925,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEiHd,1410962987,Roger Ver Launches Anonymous Bitcoin Bounty Service,"Bitcoin magnate Roger Ver has launched a new site designed to help catch criminals by offering anonymous cryptocurrency bounties.  Bitcoin Bounty Hunter  is built around a simple premise – the site lists bounties offered for information leading to the apprehension of individuals suspected of crimes.  “BitcoinBountyHunter.com represents the first step into a new era for law enforcement and the protection of individual rights,” said Ver.  The site allows anyone in any part of the world to contribute funds that would go towards individual bounties to help law enforcement arrest perpetrators of various crimes. For the time being, though, the bounties are limited to bitcoin-related crimes, but the concept could be used to put a price leading to any criminal’s arrest.  Three bounties were listed at press time and all three are related to bitcoin theft. There is a 37 BTC bounty for the hacker who tried to hack Ver and bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto, while 2 BTC bounties are offered for the arrest of the Mt Gox and Bitcoinica hackers.  Ver added:  ""I’m actually pretty optimistic that this may bring out some information that people don’t already know. It will be interesting regardless.""  Anonymity preserved  Ver explained that bitcoin allows people to anonymously donate or collect bounties, and described the factors that make this approach unique:  “Most interestingly of all, now law enforcement officers can directly and anonymously collect bounties for actually doing their jobs.”  The site allows anyone to contribute bitcoins to the community pool, post new bounties anonymously and, of course, claim a bounty.  He said the site is just the first step in a more ambitious plan to create a completely decentralised system that would not depend upon a single website.  Not for vigilantes  Bitcoin Bounty Hunter does not encourage vigilantism and the site has a number of policies designed to ensure that the letter of the law is followed.  Ver continued that the site is for people prepared to do the hard investigative work other bodies may not have the incentive to pursue. He said:  ""I tried to make it clear that the bounties are only awarded in the case of traditional law enforcement making an arrest that leads to a conviction. My intent is not to inspire people to engage in their own vigilante justice.""  The site accepts bounties for persons who committed crimes “in which there is a victim” and demands proof that a crime has indeed been committed. Evidence is submitted using a zero-knowledge proof of the evidence via proofofexistence.com.  Bounties are only paid out after the crime is reported to the proper authorities and the suspect is arrested and convicted. After the conviction, the site can be contacted with evidence that the criminal was arrested and convicted using information offered by the user.  The site’s FAQ section states:  “Once there has been a conviction, contact us with with the evidence you submitted to proofofexistence.com.

42397920,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEiDh,1410956463,Bitcoin API Developer Gem Raises $2 Million in Seed Funding,"Bitcoin API developer Gem has announced the completion of a $2m seed funding round led by First Round Capital and Tekton Ventures.  The firm's first major investment round was also supported by RRE Ventures, Mesa+, Amplify.LA, Idealab, Baroda Ventures, Crypto Currency Partners, QED Associates, Bitcoin Shop Inc and angel investor James Joaquin.  The California-based startup says the money will help accelerate growth of its new API, which was announced earlier this month at TechCrunch Disrupt San Francisco.  With the investment news, Gem also announced the appointment of former PayPal executive Ken Miller as its new chief operating officer.  Poised as a 'game changer'  Howard Morgan, partner at First Round Capital, said the company feels that Gem is positioned to become a leader as bitcoin disrupts the banking and payments industries.  “Gem’s approach to the bitcoin world, building a previously non-existent security platform for developers and others to integrate into any solution, was game-changing to us for the industry,” said Morgan.  RRE Ventures co-founder Jim Robinson described Gem’s API as the sort of disruptive innovation that has been lacking in the payments industry for a long time.  “This is a team with strong security chops building key bitcoin infrastructure,” he said.  Gem CEO Micah Winkelspecht explained that there is more to the deal than mere funding:  “Each investor has contributed not just their capital and vast network access, but also deep strategic advice. With this funding, our team is well-positioned to continue building the world’s most highly scalable and security-focused API, and continue to add key talent to the team.”  Winkelspecht said there are currently over 16,500 bitcoin apps in development on GitHub and the company’s goal is to help developers focus on their overall product rather than the underlying bitcoin protocol, cryptography and security.  Built for speed  Taking these aspects of bitcoin app development out of the equation should streamline the process, speeding up development and cutting costs.  Winkelspecht said the company is excited to receive this early stage funding, as it will help the firm become the all-in-one platform for bitcoin app development. He added that Gem enjoys “tremendous backing” from bitcoin developers.  “The potential for an all-in-one bitcoin development platform and the rise of new and exciting bitcoin apps opens the door to new, innovative ways of managing not only bitcoin funds securely, but eventually any digital asset, and that was a technical and financial services revolution I wanted to help drive,” said Ken Miller, the company’s newly appointed COO.  Miller stressed that the future of the bitcoin ecosystem depends on developers and said he believes Gem will be key to that process:  “Gem’s platform will allow them to drive mainstream user adoption of Bitcoin with the next generation of great apps, using a highly secure solution from us that requires literally less than 10 lines of code. It’s going to change the game.”  Competition in API segment intensifies  Development on the bitcoin API front has intensified in recent months and three solutions are now vying for the title of bitcoin’s premier API.  Chain announced that it is developing a bitcoin API earlier this year. The startup said its goal was to eliminate the “heavy lifting” for bitcoin app developers by offering a comprehensive API that would reduce the amount of effort and resources needed for app development.  So far, the company has managed to raise $13.7m in funding and it is backed by investors such as Barry Silbert, Pantera Capital and Homebrew.  CEX.io joined the bitcoin API race this week, with the announcement of its free PlugChain API, which is currently in beta. The team told CoinDesk that the current version was developed in a matter of weeks.

42397930,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEiLZ,1410955334,Former MercadoLibre Director Joins Bitcoin Startup Moneero,"Moneero has announced that Rodrigo Benzaquen, the former R&D director of Latin American e-commerce giant MercadoLibre, has officially joined its board of directors.  The announcement is the latest milestone for Uruguay-based bitcoin service provider Moneero, which exited stealth mode in July.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Moneero co-founder Steven Morell framed the announcement as a sign that his company is ready to move past its development stage to bring its wallet product, social apps and developer services to more consumers across Latin America and the world.  Morell told CoinDesk:  ""We need somebody who has the experience from 14–15 years with MercadoLibre, starting in the garage and building up an online empire that made it to Wall Street. Having Rodrigo means a decade and a half of experience running a multinational operation.""  Launched in 1999, MercadoLibre – the 'eBay of Latin America' – provides an e-commerce platform for consumers in 13 Latin American countries, and generates $7.3bn in annual merchandise sales. Notably, eBay itself is the firm's largest investor, owning roughly one-fifth of the company's total public stock.  In addition to his experience at MercadoLibre, Benzaquen most recently worked as an IT specialist at KaszeK Ventures, a major Buenos Aires-based capital fund that raised a $135m fund in February with support from Horsley Bridge Partners and Sequoia Heritage.  Early bitcoin adopter  Benzaquen also used the announcement to voice his support for both Moneero and the wider digital currency industry, describing himself as an ""early adopter"" of the technology and explaining that he first discovered bitcoin in 2011 during his tenure working for MercadoLibre in Silicon Valley.  The e-commerce veteran has been the most outspoken about his passion for bitcoin on his official blog, where he has reviewed bitcoin wallets and mining rigs, and even posted a presentation, cryptically titled ""Bitcoin 101 for MELI"". The heading suggests that the slideshow may have even been shown to a wider audience at his former company, which uses the stock symbol 'MELI' on NASDAQ.  In statements, Benzaquen was equally vocal about his support for his new company, saying:  ""Moneero is a very promising startup in the bitcoin field and I am sure this is going to be a great work with this exceptional team.”  Morell indicated that Benzaquen will work full time at Moneero following the announcement.  Moneero's next steps  With its formal launch and the latest addition to its board behind it, Morell indicated that Moneero will move on to a new set of challenges, namely building its customer support, addressing legal matters, forming strategic partnerships and building market share.  Morell explained:  ""Over the last year and half, we've been focused on the pipes and screws on which all we can provide now is built. What will happen in the next months to come is that we go into operation.""  Moneero intends to focus its efforts on four core products, its social, bitcoin-sending apps; its proprietary bitcoin ATMs; its SMS bitcoin wallet; and its investor trading engine.  For more of Morell's thoughts on how his startup may fare in the still nascent South American bitcoin market and the wider challenges he and his peers face, read our most recent report.

42397928,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEiJb,1410945589,Louisiana State Republican Party Now Accepts Bitcoin,"The Republican Party of Louisiana (LAGOP) is now accepting contributions in bitcoin via its official website.  Only New York state has made the same move within the Republican Party, as have the Libertarian Party of Louisiana and the Libertarian Party of Texas. The news follows guidance from the US Federal Election Commission (FEC) determining that political campaigns and political action committees (PACs) can accept bitcoin as a form of in-kind donation under current federal election laws.  Speaking to CoinDesk, LAGOP executive director Jason Doré said other states may soon follow suit as their party leaders learn more about bitcoin.  Doré told CoinDesk:  “I think the rise of bitcoin's popularity and use is forcing many public officials to learn about it. Still, many elected officials are not aware of it. If the bitcoin community embraces the use of bitcoin to support and oppose political campaigns, the role of bitcoin will only grow.”  For the initiative, the Louisiana GOP also partnered with bitcoin fundraising consultancy and services provider BitPolitic, which helped prepare LAGOP to accept bitcoin payments. In turn, BitPolitic takes a percentage of all bitcoin donations, keeping the funds in bitcoin to fuel its business.  BitPolitic provides consulting services to political candidates, campaigns and organizations that want to learn about bitcoin technology and incorporate it into the political system.  The LAGOP is using bitcoin payment processor BitPay to accept donations.  Fears over regulation  Doré said the move by the LAGOP was partly motivated by finding better ways to reach and engage its supporters, but that bitcoin also already embodies many conservative principles, such as embracing innovation and the free market, and opposing inflationary monetary policy.  Unfortunately, Democrats may be likely to target bitcoin for regulation, he said, calling for conservatives to “actively fight attempts to impose crippling regulations on the bitcoin community”.  “We know that the leadership of the Democrat Party has rarely met a regulation and a tax it doesn't like. We see how Democrat-controlled cities have opposed innovative transportation companies like Uber and Lyft in favor of government monopolies.”  Doré juxtaposed left-leaning attitudes on government taxes and regulation against the inflow of libertarians and conservatives that have publicly embraced bitcoin.  Most of the bitcoin-embracing political candidates on this year’s midterm election ballot are running on the Libertarian ticket.  California Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom, Colorado Congressman Jared Polis and California Congressional candidate Christina Gagnier are among the few Democrats that accept the digital currency for campaign donations. Although Polis in particular has been an outspoken advocate of the digital currency.  A list of some of the major US political candidates that accept bitcoin can be found here.  The view on the New York BitLicense  In the interview, Doré also took aim at the BitLicense regulations proposed by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), which he categorized as demonstrative of New York’s liberal bureaucracy.  Doré said:  “Those who seek to tax and regulate everything they can will certainly be looking to do the same to bitcoin […] These types of regulations are meant to strangle the growing bitcoin community while it is still in its infancy.”  Further, he insinuated that the LAGOP will seek to ensure that Louisiana does not take similar steps that could threaten bitcoin and its innovative potential.  Doré concluded: “In Louisiana, we will continue to take a different approach than our friends in New York by working to create an environment where innovators flourish.”  Disclaimer: CoinDesk founder Shakil Khan is an investor in BitPay.  Correction: A previous version of this article stated that the LAGOP, not the NYGOP, is the first major state-level executive committee to turn to bitcoin payments for monetary support.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Tanaya Macheel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/09/17/louisiana-state-republican-party-now-accepts-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c00b6b57b072641363875a6ede1c09837c63782b-736x397.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397929,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEiKa,1410912862,DigitalBTC Partners With Cryptsy for Mining Platform Launch,"DigitalBTC and Cryptsy are building a new platform called digitalX Mintsy that will offer both tradable mining contracts and mining infrastructure, enabling users to mine with their own equipment as well as the hashing power they purchase.  As part of the deal, Cryptsy will invest $250,000 in the Australia-based bitcoin mining services provider. The project will open for registration tomorrow.  Mintsy  will offer mining products and services on a range of digital currency hashing algorithms, including SHA-256 and crypt. Further, it will release its first products during the fourth quarter of this year.  Cryptsy CEO Paul Vernon told CoinDesk that the goal of the new platform is to offer the trading community a broad range of investment services. At the same time, Mintsy is aimed to provide more affordable access to hashing power, factoring the cost of electricity and labor expenses into the listing price.  Vernon explained:  “The price you pay is the price you pay – there’s no extra cost as you go. You don’t have to pay for extra power – you’ve already paid for the power. It’s not something you have to continuously calculate in your earnings to see how much you make. All of that’s upfront.”  Cryptsy  and digitalBTC announced that, in order to help spur enrollment, Mintsy will hold a bitcoin raffle worth $5,000.  Interconnected platforms  Like other applications of this approach to selling mining contracts, Mintsy will make available 1 petahash worth of so-called 'hashfracs', each of which represent 100TH/s. There will also be 'litefracs' and 'xfracs' available, representing litecoin and an as-yet-undecided algorithm, respectively.  Mintsy will also feature mining pools for both bitcoin and a number of other altcoins, including a multi-pool function. This, Vernon explained, was to provide the site’s users with a wider array of mining resources and allow people to mine with their own equipment as well.  Vernon told CoinDesk that the goal is to align the coin offerings on the exchange and mining platforms, saying:  “There’ll be quite a few [coins available]. Basically, everything you see on Cryptsy that is mineable should probably be mineable on Mintsy as well.”  There will also be a degree of interconnectivity between Mintsy and Cryptsy. Similar to the relationship between CEX.io and GHash, users will be able to transfer balances between the two platforms.  Commodification of hash power continues  An increasing number of companies in the exchange and mining industries are offering tradable contracts as the model has emerged as an alternative to traditional cloud mining agreements.  This week, Bitfinex announced the launch of a beta tranche of tradable mining contracts. Cryptsy itself is no stranger to tradable hashes. Earlier this year, the exchange began offeringhttps://www.cryptsy.com/currencies/view/139 an asset that allowed owners to earn daily dividends.  Despite the rising popularity of commodified hashing power, there are still major players in the space that offer more traditional mining contracts.  KnCMiner  recently launched a cloud hashing initiative at its Norway-based data center. At the time, the company asserted that hosted solutions are becoming a more attractive option for miners, a sentiment that has been increasingly echoed by businesses that offer both tradable and traditional mining contracts.
