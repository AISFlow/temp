42427032,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyf3h,1471994862,Big Banks Band Together to Launch 'Settlement Coin',"Four banks have reportedly partnered on a blockchain project aimed at creating a means to clear and settle transactions worldwide.  BNY Mellon, Deutsche Bank, Santander and UBS – the latter of which first disclosed its work on a so-called ""settlement coin"" last year – are hoping to launch a commercial-grade blockchain system by 2018, according to The Financial Times. The banks are working with blockchain startup Clearmatics, based in London.  A formal announcement will reportedly be made tomorrow, FT's Martin Arnold reports.  He explained in the article:  ""The utility settlement coin, based on a solution developed by Clearmatics Technologies, aims to let financial institutions pay for securities, such as bonds and equities, without waiting for traditional money transfers to be completed. Instead they would use digital coins that are directly convertible into cash at central banks, cutting the time and cost of post-trade settlement and clearing.""  The banks involved have spent much of the past two years working on various applications for the technology, and all four are members of the R3 distributed ledger consortium.  CoinDesk will continue monitoring this developing story.

42427027,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyeth,1471988056,Bitfury Research Shines Light on Bitcoin Privacy Weaknesses,"A new Bitfury white paper aims to advance the study of how bitcoins sent using certain privacy-enhancing techniques could be traced back to participants.  Released today, ""Shared Send Untangling in Bitcoin"" explores how bitcoins in this type of transaction can be ""untangled"", or sorted, into their original value flows. Shared send transactions originate when users organize into groups, by way of an intermediary, in order to obfuscate how funds may be moving between wallets.  ""We establish a theoretical approach to shared send transaction analysis, which formulates the transaction untangling problem in terms of the graph theory. We also describe several practically important modifications to the untangling problem,"" the paper states.  Of note are its implications for CoinJoin and CoinSwap, algorithms that mix transactions inputs and outputs, and that were seen as advances in bringing privacy to the open, public blockchain that records bitcoin transactions.  The research is also the latest by Bitfury that demonstrates its willingness to expand beyond bitcoin mining, following a report in July that sought to solve challenges related to the Lightning Network, an in-development bitcoin micropayments platform.  According to the company, the findings will serve to inform the ""Bitfury Crystal Blockchain"", a forthcoming web service for blockchain investigation and analysis.  A spokesperson for the startup said:  ""We are looking to solve hard technical problems that we can commercialize. What we’re doing with this project is something that we think we can monetize.""  The work comes at a time when blockchain analytics tools are increasingly in demand from financial institutions seeking to interact with industry businesses.  Startups like Chainalysis, Elliptic and Skry, for instance, have all so far moved to capitalize on demand from industries and governments, though Bitfury would be the best capitalized firm to enter the market.  The research does not explore ""shared coin services"", tools that send bitcoins to an intermediary and in which the process of sending and receiving an intended transaction is divided into several transactions.  Transaction definitions  As part of this effort, Bitfury's researchers spend much of the report seeking to define shared send transactions, a process that involved categorizing transactions observed on the blockchain in a way that provided more nuance to the interactions studied.  The white paper divides transactions into four types, the most basic of which are wallet-to-wallet transactions and separable transactions, or those that can be split into ""subsets"" of money flows.  Ambiguous transactions (those observed to have at least two separate money flows) and intractable transactions (those whose category cannot be determined) are among the more complex and potentially challenging from a compliance perspective.  ""People who aren't involved in this transaction can’t say which people sent the money,"" a researcher explained.  In total, Bitfury said it analyzed 10 million bitcoin transactions that took place between 27th May and 11th July of this year, finding that just 2.5% were ‘intractable’.  ""Shared send transactions constitute approximately 13.5% of all studied bitcoin transactions. Of these, about 82% are simple transactions, ~9.6% are separable, and ~6.3% are ambiguous,"" the report reads.  In comments, researchers involved with the project noted that intractable transactions don’t technically exist, as should there be a proper analysis, it could always be sorted into one of the three classes.  'Nefarious actors'  Long term, the Bitfury team wasn’t shy about stating that the tool is intended for use by firms that want to ensure they are transacting in a compliant manner.  ""Ultimately we’re seeking to make the blockchain more secure by ensuring it's used for good purposes, not nefarious actors,"" a spokesperson said.  The paper, however, cautioned that shared send transactions aren’t necessarily the result of a mixing service meant to hide illicit actions, and that hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets, those that derive keys from a single seed, can be sorted into this category.  ""In this paper, we think of the problem and ask, ‘What kind of transactions are there?'"" a researcher said.  Representatives of the company said the paper should be thought of as Bitfury’s ""first step"" in advancing work in this part of the field, but that more research in this area is likely.

42427024,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyelh,1471979706,US Nuclear Research Lab Developing Bitcoin Analysis Tool,"A federally funded research lab run by Lockheed Martin is developing a bitcoin analytics tool for the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  The project, first detailed in a 19th August newsletter published by Sandia National Laboratories, marks a continuation of previously detailed efforts at the DHS. The project is being funded by the DHS Science and Technology Directorate, which late last year issued a call for blockchain research.  Thus far, the bitcoin project appears to be in the early stages – Sandia has reportedly created a set of ""requirements"" for an analysis tool and is moving to develop a user interface to enable additional tests.  Andrew Cox, an R&D analyst for Sandia, said during an interview published in the newsletter that the tool would be best utilized as part of a broader investigatory effort involving multiple angles.  He remarked:  ""To be successful, the reality is it’s going to take different types of algorithms and additional types of investigative techniques including good old-fashioned police work. They’re all going to have to be combined.""  He went on to argue that such tools would actually encourage broader bitcoin adoption  ""In many ways, figuring out how to effectively combat illicit bitcoin commerce and reduce its perception as a tool of criminals can encourage more people and companies to adopt bitcoin for legitimate purposes,"" he said.  Founded in the late 1940s, Sandia's traces its lineage back to the Manhattan project and the invention of the atomic bomb. Today, its primary focus is developing technology for nuclear weapons, though the laboratory also works on broader defense and energy projects under the purview of the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA).  Though still in development, the tools are similar to those already available to the market today.  Startups like Chainalysis, Skry and Elliptic have all moved to capitalize on demand from law enforcement for blockchain forensics tools – much to the chagrin of privacy advocates in the bitcoin space. The rise of ransomware has further fueled interest in these capabilities.

42427003,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyadh,1471974379,Bank of Japan: Blockchain Could Alter Financial Services,"The way financial services are designed could evolve with the development of blockchain technology and distributed ledgers, the governor of Japan's central bank said this week.  The new remarks from Haruhiko Kuroda, governor of the Bank of Japan, were issued at an event held at the institution's FinTech Center, itself established this year as part of an effort to study financial tech.  He cited artificial intelligence and blockchain as advances that could alter the face of financial services.  Kuroda said:  ""Given that the development of financial services has been supported by ledgers as the basic infrastructure for information, the dramatic changes in how ledgers are kept may have the potential of significantly changing the structure of financial services.""  Kuroda's remarks on the technology echoed those of deputy governor Hiroshi Nakato, who said in May that central banks should keep a close eye on developments around digital currencies and blockchain.  In his speech, Kuroda indicated that the Bank of Japan wants to take a leading role in financial technology research, a process that could ultimately impact how the central bank operates.  ""The Bank of Japan is ready to lead research and analysis on FinTech, in view of the possibility that the Bank itself may apply FinTech technologies to its operations in the future,"" he said.  The statements come amid rising interest and investment in blockchain and distributed ledgers domestically. Recent news articles have gone so far as to note a shortage of talent facing the Japanese market, though this trend can also been observed more broadly.

42427008,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyaph,1471964784,South African Central Bank 'Open' to Blockchain and Cryptocurrency,"South Africa’s central bank is “open” to cryptocurrencies and blockchain, according to new statements from its governor.  In a speech today at a cybersecurity conference held in Johannesburg, governor Lesetja Kganyago indicated that the South African Reserve Bank is exploring the technology and interested in innovations that may stem from its development.  Kganyago, who has served as governor of the central bank since 2014, suggested that the Reserve Bank would look for possible uses that would help the institution ""execute our mandate more effectively and efficiently"".  Kganyago told attendees:  ""As a central bank, we are open to innovations despite the different opinions of regulators on matters such as cryptocurrencies. We are willing to consider the merits and risks of blockchain technology and other distributed ledgers.""  The remarks suggest a greater degree of interest on the part of the central bank in the technology, coming less than two years after it released a position paper on digital currencies.  At the time, the bank warned local consumers about the perceived risks of using digital currencies from an anti-money laundering and cyberfraud perspective. However, it noted that it ""does not oversee, supervise or regulate the VC landscape"".  Private institutions in South Africa, on the other hand, have made significant overtures to explore, test and deploy the technology.  A number of domestic banks have been involved in tests using ethereum, and startups working in the country have explored use cases like crowdfunded energy.

42427010,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyath,1471954597,Digital Asset to Open Source Smart Contract Language,"Digital Asset Holdings has announced it intends to open-source DAML, the smart contracting language it acquired from startup Elevence earlier this year.  Though no date has been set for the transition, the Blythe Masters-led blockchain startup credited its bid to ""advance industry adoption"" of the tech as the impetus for the move.  However, Digital Asset said work needs to be done to increase DAML's functionality and documentation so that it is ready for use outside the startup.  The company wrote:  ""By making DAML more widely available, we intend to enable clients, partners and other vendors to develop, modify and extend DAML Libraries for use with the Digital Asset Platform or other platforms, fostering a vibrant ecosystem of vendors and solutions.""  Elsewhere, Digital Asset Holdings hinted at the collapse of The DAO, a smart contract created using ethereum's Solidity language, in assertions that available tools are not adequate for business or industry needs.  The move comes amid a larger drive by financial institutions and startups to explore and develop new smart contracting languages.  In August  , Barclays revealed it is working with University College London on a smart contracting language, while startups like Legalese have won grants to continue development of new alternatives.
