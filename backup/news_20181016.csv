42429840,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1afh,1539729009,"Stablecoins All Want to Be $1, But They're Not Worth the Same","The market is starting to differentiate between stablecoins, even though these cryptocurrencies are all designed to trade 1-to-1 with fiat.  Several U.S. dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies are now trading either significantly higher or significantly lower than the greenback, reflecting investors' perceptions of their relative risk.  Given that stablecoins are typically used as on-ramps for investors looking to purchase bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, these premiums and discounts mean that customers may not be paying bitcoin's ""sticker price,"" as listed on a given exchange or data platform.  The new, more discriminating valuations began Monday morning, when the best-known stablecoin, tether (USDT), broke its peg, falling to a low of roughly $0.87. And while the price stabilized closer to $1 over the next day or so, its market capitalization dropped significantly, indicating that tethers are being taken out of circulation.  Indeed, based on data compiled through CoinMarketCap, the market sees USDT as the riskiest stablecoin at present, paying less than a dollar for each token. At press time, the token was trading for about $0.98.  This discount may reflect longstanding doubts that the issuing company, known as Tether, has enough dollars in reserve to fully back its tokens; the company, which has close ties to the crypto exchange Bitfinex, has long said it is fully reserved but has been unable to get an audit.  On the flip side, the Gemini Dollar (GUSD), backed by the Winklevoss brothers' Gemini exchange, saw its price climb, hitting an all-time high of $1.19 per token, though by press time it fell back to $1.04.  Other major stablecoins – the USD//Coin (USDC) issued by Circle, the TrueUSD (TUSD) issued by TrustToken and the Paxos Standard Dollar (PAX) issued by Paxos – are similarly trading just above $1, though none of these three reached GUSD's highs.  In particular, the contrast between GUSD and PAX's prices is further highlighted by the volume of each token in circulation: while Paxos announced Monday night that more than 50 million tokens have been issued, the supply of GUSD appears to be far lower.  Purchasing power  As a result of the new risk premiums, how much an investor pays for one bitcoin is fluctuating depending on which stablecoin they are using. At one point on Tuesday, purchasing one bitcoin in USDT was roughly $700 more expensive than purchasing one bitcoin in GUSD.  To further illustrate the impact on investors: If an investor were to buy $6,017.93 worth of GUSD, they would then be able to purchase 1 bitcoin. In comparison, a bitcoin would cost $6,419.72 if bought in TUSD, $6,438.74 in USDC, $6,448.70 in PAX or $6,709.16 in USDT, as of 18:00 UTC.  In contrast, bitcoin costs $6,585.52 if bought directly with the U.S. dollar, according to CoinMarketCap.  Put another way, bitcoin is more expensive when bought with USDT than it is with any other dollar-pegged stablecoin on this list.  Conversely, bitcoin is the cheapest when bought with GUSD, indicating that the crypto market overall has more confidence in this month-old stablecoin than in tether, the one that's been around the longest.

The exchange announced Tuesday that coinbase.com, Android and iOS app users would be able to trade, buy, sell or store ZRX, after initially announcing that Coinbase Pro would support the token on October 11. ZRX is the first ERC-20 token to be listed by the exchange.  At the time, the exchange said it would list the token on retail platforms at a later date.  However, not all Coinbase customers will have access to the token immediately: in a blog post, Coinbase Consumer president and general manager Dan Romero wrote that the token ""will not initially be available for residents of the United Kingdom or the state of New York.""  As a result, this listing appears to be the first to abide by Coinbase's recently-announced revamped asset listing process. The exchange told CoinDesk last month that new assets would be added on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis, allowing it to support a greater number of assets more quickly than it was otherwise able to.  ""We are also investing in new tools to help people understand and explore cryptocurrencies,"" Romero wrote Tuesday. To that end, the exchange's website now includes an informational resource page for the 0x token, as well as a more general educational page on cryptocurrencies in general.  The price of ZRX/USD jumped 17 percent in the hour after Coinbase announced it would be added to its retail platform, reaching a daily high of $0.89 according to data from the Binance exchange. ZRX reached a similar price of $0.91 on October 11 following the previous listing announcement from Coinbase Pro.  Sam Ouimet contributed reporting.

42429842,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1alh,1539710105,Winklevoss-Backed Stablecoin Soars Above $1 as Tether's Market Cap Plunges,"A second stablecoin has broken its peg with the U.S. dollar – except this one's soaring well above a buck, not tanking below it.  According to data from CoinMarketCap, the Gemini exchange-issued Gemini dollar (GUSD) saw its price hit an all-time high of $1.19 Tuesday after first breaking its dollar peg on Monday, when it shot up to $1.14. At press time, the token was trading at $1.18.  The GUSD was released in early September, when the exchange, founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, announced it had secured approval from the New York Department of Financial Services to list and issue the dollar-pegged token.  At the time, a press release stated the token would be ""strictly pegged"" to the dollar, as previously reported. Like other stablecoins, the GUSD's purpose is to provide liquidity for traders who wish to avoid delays when buying cryptocurrencies caused by having to directly convert actual dollars.  The news comes a day after tether (USDT), the world's best-known stablecoin, broke its peg in the opposite direction, falling to an 18-month low of $0.869, as previously reported by CoinDesk.  While tether regained its peg over the course of the day (trading at about $0.98 as of press time), its market capitalization has plunged, indicating the total supply of tokens has declined. According to CoinMarketCap, roughly 2.26 billion USDT tokens remain in circulation, out of a roughly 3 billion total supply.  In contrast, there were about 2.67 billion tokens in circulation on October 14, two days ago, and 2.8 billion a week prior on October 7.  The decline in the token's market capitalization reflects this dwindling number of tokens in circulation: at press time the total market cap was roughly $2.2 billion, having dropped from $2.4 billion in about 10 hours. Tether's market cap was $2.8 billion on October 7, matching the circulating supply at the time.  Perhaps most notably, CoinMarketCap data indicates that tethers are being taken out of circulation at regular intervals, as shown by the steep drops in the blue line representing USDT's market cap.  When reached for comment, Bitfinex communications director Kasper Rasmussen explained that ""the supply of USDT decreases upon redemption.""  He added:  ""Hypothetically, when the supply of USDT on Bitfinex surpasses a certain level required for maintaining operations (i.e. a seamless flow of deposits and withdrawals), a batch of USDT would be sent from Bitfinex to Tether for redemption against fiat USD. This subsequently lowers the circulating supply of USDT whilst the fiat USD previously held by Tether goes to the redeeming party.""  Gemini did not respond to a request for comment by press time.

Furthermore, blockchain startup SUKU, headed by a group of former Deloitte employees, launched a supply chain platform built on the ethereum and quorum blockchains, also in September.  Notably, a majority of shipping executives seem to be increasingly focused on blockchain. A recent survey by INTTRA, an ocean carrier network, found that over 53 percent of the 130 execs polled said they were interested in the technology.

42429832,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1aRh,1539700242,Australian State Eyes Blockchain Upgrade for Property Transactions,"As part of a plan to put all property transactions into the digital realm, a department of Australia's New South Wales (NSW) government is turning to blockchain technology.  With the state having ordered the digitization of all property transactions from July 1, 2019, NSW Land Registry Services – the operator of land titling and registry operations in the state – is launching a proof-of-concept (PoC) trial to gauge if blockchain is the best way to go, according to local news outlet CIO.  For the technical side of the effort, the agency is partnering with Sweden-based ChromaWay to conduct the PoC on its blockchain platform, with completion expected by early next year.  Currently, the report states, all land transactions are recorded manually and are written into public registers. Once the digitization process is complete, that will no longer be the case and paper contracts will no longer be valid.  Ultimately, if the PoC proves successful, all conveyancing data in NSW may end up on a register built with ChromaWay's open-source technology, though such a shift to Land Registry Services' operations would require regulatory approval first.  Touting the potential for blockchain to replace paper processes, ChromaWay said in the article that, using blockchain systems, information remains ""secure and immutable, while also being accessible and searchable.""  The startup continued:  ""It will provide a more complete and comprehensive view of land rights, restrictions, and responsibilities, which will streamline decision-making for government and land sector actors, provide increased information transparency, and reduce data duplication.""  The NSW government is currently looking at other use cases for blockchain. Last month, it announced a digitization program for driver license holders in the state, which is expected to roll out in 2019. Blockchain would underpin the initiative, securing data in a distributed fashion.  ChromaWay, too, is involved in a number of other notable projects, having provided technology and assistance for Sweden's land registry authority in a similar pilot effort, as reported by CoinDesk in June. The Indian state of Andhra Pradesh has also partnered with the firm on its land registry trial, announced in October 2017.

The exchange will then review the account – which may take up to 48 hours, it warns – and approved users will be provided details (""specific to the individual's transaction"") as to how to send the fiat currency.  It also adds that deposits must be a minimum of $10,000 (a seemingly pre-existing condition) and will be processed in six–10 days.  In a comment responding to unspecified ""attacks,"" Bitfinex said:  ""We believe this system to be significantly more durable in the face of sustained attacks by our competition and their supporters.

42429835,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1aXh,1539691187,The Crypto Protocol Trying to Unite Every Exchange Order Book,"Imagine the liquidity of every crypto exchange, but in one giant pool – one all-seeing order book that listed every conceivable bid and ask for any asset.  That's the promise of a new startup announcing its equity seed round Tuesday exclusively with CoinDesk. Led by Polychain Capital, with participation by Dragonfly Capital Partners and Chapter One, the Paradigm Foundation has raised $1 million to build a decentralized order book open to anyone that wants to trade crypto.  It's all part of a plan Paradigm's CEO, Liam Kovatch, calls the company's mission ""to create open, borderless, and efficient global markets.""  Co-founded with Henry Harder at Columbia, the two co-founders are on leave from the university while they build out the product, which should have a beta to show by the end of the year.  The small round was oversubscribed, the founders say. ""The decision to cap at $1 million was strategic. At a high level, 0x raised $775,000 for their seed and we wanted to follow a similar route in regards to being capital efficient and lean,"" Kovatch told CoinDesk.  Decentralized exchanges have been slowly taking root in the market, but they don't have nearly the liquidity centralized exchanges do. That is, when someone wants to make a sell order, it's very likely there won't be anyone to buy. They lack what's called ""order book depth.""  ""To this day, individual financial relayers (like ones building on the 0x or Dharma protocols) have had to not only bootstrap a completely new set of users, but also their own liquidity,"" Niraj Pant from Polychain said in a statement.  For traders, one order book that shows every possible counterparty on earth is an enticing proposition. It's the difference between the pre-internet world of travel agents and the present world of finding airplane tickets through, say, Kayak, which plugs into everyone's deals.  Though as Kovatch pointed out, Paradigm takes it slightly further than a Web 2.0 site like Kayak can, because it's built on the decentralized web. Rather than curating all the offers, Paradigm actually has them all listed on one platform.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Paradigm simply provides the 'location' for vendors to find customers and customers to find vendors.""  A competitive pool  In a sense, then, Paradigm is a bet that the walls between the big crypto exchanges will inevitably fall.  That's the view of Dragonfly Capital, which recently announced its first $100 million crypto fund, with backing from venture leaders, including Chris Dixon (a16z), Olaf Carlson-Wee (Polychain) and Salil Deshpande (Bain Capital Ventures).  Dragonfly specifically aims to capitalize on crypto's growth in Asia, and it firmly believes that Paradigm is building necessary tooling ahead of trends already underway there.  ""What is remarkable about crypto and crypto companies is how willing they are to disrupt themselves,"" Alex Pack, Dragonfly's managing director, told CoinDesk.  Dragonfly already has relationships with large exchanges. ""Many of them are working on internal DEXs [decentralized exchanges]. They are doing radical experiments with their core business all the time,"" he said.  It's just a matter of time before they start to open up to join a platform like Paradigm. ""There is plenty of room for centralized entities in a paradigm world,"" Pack said, rattling off examples like order matching, market making, automated trading engines and more.  ""Binance has said that they want to become completely decentralized,"" Kovatch noted. Still, he's cautious about predicting the evolution will happen quickly. ""The liquidity network that we're creating needs to be large enough to incentivize that movement,"" he granted.  But Paradigm has the advantage of not needing to build all that out themselves. As new companies build up on platforms like 0x, they have a reason to plug into Paradigm. And users don't have to be companies.  ""We allow anybody – you don't have to be a reputable exchange – to advertise liquidity,"" Kovatch said. It will take some coding to do it, but regular people can put their offers on the same book as the giants.  Not everyone will want to do that, so companies will be able to compete on user experience and features.  What they won't be able to compete on is fees. Trading fees should evaporate in short order once the shift starts, Kovatch predicts, saying: ""I don't think multi-dollar trading fees are going to really exist.""  A different paradigm  For now, though, decentralized exchanges run too slow.  Trustlessness has tradeoffs. Users trust regular exchanges so settlement can be really fast. All the ""ownership"" is virtual anyway. No one has the private key to their accounts on centralized exchanges. They just have balances on a spreadsheet.  This allows centralized exchanges to nail down transactions much faster than decentralized ones can, which need to wait for block confirmation times.  ""When you go on something like Radar Relay, you'll be able to watch order book changes,"" Kovatch explained to CoinDesk. ""It's ridiculous to think you can mark movements with a pen.""  On Binance, the order book is changing thousands of times a second, he said. It's just on another level of liquidity.  To catch up, Paradigm is working on solving that speed problem. Their protocol can be thought of as a sidechain, one that's lightweight and buily specifically for its use case. ""It is completely independent of ethereum,"" Kovatch said.  Making Paradigm ""competitively performant"" is, he said, ""something we're still working on to this day and we will be working on for a considerable period of time.""  Kovatch concluded:  ""The decentralized finance community is one of the strongest use cases – if not the killer app – for ethereum.""

42429844,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1ahh,1539687613,Bitcoin Price Is Defending One Key Support for the Fifth Month Running,"Bitcoin (BTC) is defending a key long-term price floor as it recovers from Friday's three-week lows near $6,200.  After a strong bearish move last Thursday, the leading cryptocurrency looked set to pierce the 21-day exponential moving average (EMA), which has been serving as a strong support since June.  However, yesterday's rally to over $6,800 ensured that the crucial EMA support remains intact. At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,730 on Bitfinex, having clocked a high of $7,788 yesterday. Meanwhile, the 21-month EMA is located at $6,160.  The argument that the bear market has likely run its course remains valid as long as prices are trading above the 21-month EMA.  However, while the solid bounce from the area around the crucial EMA support is encouraging, a bullish reversal is still not confirmed, as discussed yesterday.  Monthly chart  As seen in the chart above, the bears are struggling to penetrate the 21-month EMA for the fifth month running.  It's also worth noting that each time the bears fail to force prices below 21-day EMA, they end up raising the probability of a bullish reversal.  Weekly chart  BTC's repeated failure to keep gains above the 10-week EMA over the last four weeks has established the technical indicator as the key resistance to beat for the bulls.  As of writing, BTC is trading above that mark (currently at $6,671) on Bitfinex, however, only a weekly close on Sunday (UTC time) above moving average would confirm a continuation of the rally from mid-September lows.  If the cryptocurrency finds acceptance above $7,000 in the next day or two, though, a breakout would be confirmed.  View  Sellers continue to have a tough time pushing prices below the 21-day EMA support.  A sustained break (weekly or monthly close) below the 21-day EMA would signal a revival of the sell-off from the record high of $20,000 hit last December.  A bullish reversal would be confirmed if prices pass September highs above $7,400.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

In an announcement Tuesday, the Singapore-based exchange – currently, the fourth-largest by trading volume – said it will open deposits and withdrawals for TrustToken's TUSD, Circle's USDC, and two regulator-approved stablecoins: the Gemini exchange's GUSD and Paxos' PAX, on Oct. 19.  Huobi is also the fourth-largest trading platform for the trading of U.S dollar-pegged stablecoin tether (USDT), with $231 million-worth changing hands in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data.  A spokesperson for Huobi told CoinDesk that its existing support for USDT will continue as usual.  Livio Weng, VP of Huobi Group, said:  ""Tether is one of the biggest stablecoins in the market, and realistically it will take some time before other stablecoins can catch up. We currently have no plans to restrict trading, deposits, or withdrawals in regards to Tether. However, in the interest of providing users with more choice, we are also in the process of listing several new stable coins.""  The exchange added that, since the total capitalization of the stablecoin market is still relatively small and not suitable for large-scale trading, it is also seeking institutional investors and over-the-counter traders to sign up as market makers.  The news comes a day after USDT saw a crash in price to 18-month lows amid concerns over whether its developer holds enough dollars to fully back the assets.  Tether later issued a statement claiming that all of its USDT in circulation are ""sufficiently backed by U.S. dollars and that assets have always exceeded liabilities.""

42429841,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1ajh,1539676816,Do These Indicators Suggest a Bitcoin Price Rally Early in 2019?,"Bitcoin (BTC), the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has enjoyed a staggering price increase in excess of 150,000 percent since it was first listed on exchanges back in July 2010.  Since then, the cryptocurrency has also experienced multiple bull runs, bear runs (the longest of which consumed much of 2014 and 2015) and stronger media attention year on year.  From a technical perspective, the relationship BTC has with traditional charting patterns is occasionally counter-intuitive to what one would normally expect.  Take, for example, the descending triangle which is typically bearish in nature.  While it does contain the prospect for breaking either way, the repeated failed (bearish) descending triangle breakdowns over the course of bitcoin's life cycle, leaves an unanswered question, are we viewing these patterns the wrong way? And if so what makes this year different?  The case for bitcoin's bullish breakout  Weekly chart  Bitcoin's relationship with the 200-day moving average (DMA) and descending triangle pattern has been significant.  Descending triangles are measured by connecting a series of lower highs, usually angled at 45 degrees and breaking down left to right thus creating a primary trendline. The secondary baseline connects two or more of the lowest lows in a series to form the horizontal 'floor'.  What you end up with is a descending triangle pattern that demonstrates a gradual loss of confidence in the asset you are looking at.  When the patterns and indicators are combined on bitcoin's weekly chart they show a consistent counter-play to their traditional bearish norms. As can be seen, price generally breaks bullish from the formation instead of continuing to lower supports as it normally should.  The only other time bitcoin broke down from the descending triangle was back in March 2014. Post-breakdown, the bulls managed a short-term rally before being rejected by the 200-DMA, which held price under for 1.2 years.  It's clear that the price of bitcoin being under the 200 DMA firmly establishes the market as bearish, and this time around is no exception. That said, history would suggest an upside break of the current descending triangle may be on the cards soon, and that could initiate a move above the DMA as a sign of a larger trend reversal.  While it does offer insights into the relationship bitcoin has with the 200-DMA, it is key to remember that the patterns also vary in scope and size, which is usually telling of the price action that follows.  So, based off the previous 1.2 year bear run, it's possible bitcoin could turn bullish by early next year, especially if all fundamentals are taken into account, as suggested by CNBC cryptotrader, Ran Nuener.  The case for bitcoin's bearish breakdowns  On the flipside, bitcoin has been staring down a bear market for the last 7 months and has dropped below the significant 200-DMA beginning Feb. 5.  Traditional patterns such as descending triangles are still worth viewing in bearish terms since the onset rush from 2017/18 was unprecedented and the subsequent sell-off that followed has seen bitcoin drop 67 percent to date from its all-time-high in December 2017.  Daily chart  As stated earlier, price falling below the 200 DMA has proven to be a sign the market has officially turned bearish.  A bearish trend combined with a bearish price pattern, the descending triangle, creates an ideal technical set up for further depreciation even though bitcoin tends to negate the bear view.  If price does break down as it technically should, there is a prior resistance and support zone in the $4,900 to $5,400 that may once again offer support to the falling price.  If price breaks up as it historically should, the nearby lower highs need to be surpassed on the higher time frames in order to prove a bearish to bullish trend change is in order. The first lower high that price needs to find acceptance above is near $6,850 (differs among exchanges dealing in USDT), while the next is closer to $7,400.  View  Bitcoin has ignored the bearish implications of the descending triangle in the past, so there is merit in considering a bullish resolution.  Beginning in 2012, prices dropped below the 200-DMA (including 2018) twice. The prior bear market lasted 1.2 years, leaving some to speculate a possible ending in sight for the current retracement in price from the all-time-highs seen late last year.  A weekly close below the triangle would likely provide confirmation to bearish continuation and set the stage for a prolonged bear market.  Only finding acceptance above the 200 DMA and the descending triangle would revive bullish market settings  Disclosure: The authors hold USDT at the time of writing.

Dorothy Jean Chang, vice president of marketing and communications for Paxos, announced in a tweet on Monday that in the month since the company rolled out PAX on Sept. 10, it had issued $36 million-worth of the stablecoin in exchange for U.S. dollar deposits.  ""And now… we are over $50M already,"" the spokesperson added, hinting more than $14 million-worth of PAX could have been issued in just the past several days.  CoinDesk reported last month that Paxos launched PAX as one of the first stablecoins that was approved and backed by regulators, namely, the New York Department of Financial Services, in Paxos' case.  In addition, Withum, an independent auditing firm that inspects Paxos' U.S dollar reserve on a monthly basis, released an audit report on Sept. 28, which indicated that the firm held about $14 million, backing the roughly 14 million PAX it had issued.  Paxos said in an announcement on Monday that the growth so far has been driven by adoption by several larger cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance and OKEx, which announced their moves to list PAX for trading on their platforms.  The news also comes at a time when the cryptocurrency market has seen controversy surrounding USDT – the U.S. dollar-pegged crypto launched by Tether – which tanked to its 18-month low on Monday to around $0.95, as CoinDesk reported.  And at one point on the same day, Binance, the world's largest trading platform by volume, halted USDT withdrawals during what it called a period of heightened activity.

42429829,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1aLh,1539658533,Ethereum's Next Blockchain Upgrade Faces Delay After Testing Failure,"Repercussions are being felt in the ethereum development ecosystem after an initial test of the platform's forthcoming software upgrade, Constantinople, failed to deliver expected results.  A system-wide change initially earmarked to go live in 2018, the code release, meant to introduce five improvements and alter the economics of the $20 billion blockchain, may now be delayed following a failure of Saturday's activation on the test network Ropsten, developers told CoinDesk on Monday.  After a meeting of ethereum's open-source developer team last Friday, in which it was suggested that Constantinople could be implemented as early as November, Saturday's failed activation revealed unexpected issues in the code. Namely, a bug was discovered by security lead for the Ethereum Foundation Martin Holst Swende, one which caused two different iterations of the same software upgrade to run on testnet.  Though a patch to fix the identified bug has since been issued, independent ethereum developer Lane Rettig explained to CoinDesk Monday that investigations into the events of Constantinople testnet release are ongoing.  Rettig said:  ""We should take our time to understand what went wrong and how to avoid issues like this in the future - not just the low-level code issue but all of the related issues (the mining issue, communication issues over the weekend, how it wasn't caught by the tests, etc.) There's a lot of forensics still to be done.""  Rettig also affirmed that plans for Constantinople's release could be delayed as a result, asserting: ""If an upgrade causes a fork on the testnet, we should put the mainnet release on hold for some minimum period of time.""  While a fixed date for implementation of Constantinople has yet to be set, Griff Green, ethereum community lead and founder of blockchain-based nonprofit Giveth, set mainnet activation for sometime in 2019.  ""I would expect it to get delayed to 2019, the blockchain doesn't take holidays, but developers do,"" Green said. ""If I were to make a wager on a prediction market I would put my ETH on late January, early February.""  Ethereum core developers have agreed to collectively regroup this coming Friday over a live-streamed call that will find them discussing plans in light of the failed test implementation.  'Never fork on weekends'  To recap the events of Saturday, rollout of Constantinople was planned to proceed on ethereum's main test network at block number 4,230,000, however, miners failed to upgrade their software in accordance with the timed launch.  As it occurred ""much earlier than expected on a Saturday,"" Schoedon said many developers ""[were] not available and not even aware"" of the change. Schoedon added his takeaway from the events: ""Never fork on weekends.""  This proved to be an issue, as for the hard fork to progress smoothly, all participating ""nodes"" or computers run by miners and users, needed to upgrade near-simultaneously to the same software.  Following an open call from ethereum developers on social media to move the test forward, the network underwent a second chain split as a result of discrepancies in Constantinople code between two major ethereum clients, Geth and Parity. (As background, ethereum clients are the individuals and businesses running nodes to support the ethereum network.)  Speaking to CoinDesk, Brian Venturo, a miner actively contributing to the Ropsten testnet, explained:  ""It looks like the consensus failure was driven by changes to the SSTORE opcode in EIP-1283 that were implemented differently between Parity and Geth.""  Part of the Constantinople upgrade features new code under ethereum improvement proposal (EIP) 1283 that will change the way smart contracts are stored on ethereum and reduce the cost to smart contract developers of updating stored contracts.  However, the iteration of EIP 1283 as designed in the Constantinople code released by Parity featured refund mechanisms that caused a ""noticeable disagreement regarding [Ropsten] block 4,230,605"" and the cost for the deployment of this smart contract, as highlighted in the official notes by ethereum core developers.  Upon discovering the discrepancies in Constantinople code, ethereum core developers agreed to patch Parity's code to align with code supported by Geth and attempt another re-sync to the correct Ropsten chain.  Part of the Plan  Still, some see the failed test as a positive for development overall.  Seeing the attempted rollout of Constantinople on Ropsten this past Saturday as having achieved its intended purpose, Rettig tweeted out on Sunday:  ""We broke Ropsten, but it's a testnet, and it will be fixed, and this is precisely the point of releasing to a testnet first. It's really fun, exciting, and reassuring to see this process play out as designed.""  He also later added in email to CoinDesk Monday that he now had ""more confidence than ever that the right things are happening, in the right order, to keep [ethereum] mainnet running and secure.""  Other core developers appear to agree with the sentiment shared by Rettig, with the security lead at the Ethereum Foundation writing in a public Gitter channel that Saturday was ""evidently a good test,"" adding that the temporary forked state of Ropsten was nothing to ""lose any sleep over.""  Ethereum core developer, Alexey Akhunov, also wrote in the same channel that while ""smooth processes are good for efficiency...they can [instill] a false sense of security,"" adding that, ""breakages...make people more alert.""  Moving forward, the plan for all ethereum developers as explained by release manager for Parity, Afri Schoedon, is to implement bug fixes for relevant clients and ""bring them all together on the Geth Ropsten chain again.""  He added that ""once this is done, hopefully around Devcon, we can continue testing Constantinople on Ropsten...and eventually agree on a main network fork date.""  Schoeden affirmed that he too thinks the most likely outcome will be a release date in the new year.  Schoedon told CoinDesk:  ""I see January 2019 as realistic fork date, but only if the clients will be patched, all tests are ready (and pass), and [there] are no further issues discovered on Ropsten.""
