Commercial Bank of Qatar said this week that it had completed the trial focused on real-time, bank-to-bank payments in a bid to cut costs. The bank is developing future iterations of the system, which would require the approval of the Qatari central bank and other trade partners.  The idea, according to the bank, is to use the tech to develop payment corridors in regions like the Philippines, Egypt and the UAE, among others.  CEO Joseph Abraham said in a statement:  ""Blockchain has huge potential to change the financial services sector and we are proud to be the pioneers in leading this change in Qatar by introducing yet another new technology to provide the best client experience for all our customers.""  Next on the agenda is trade finance applications.  According to the bank, future tests will focus on utilizing the tech to manage trade finance transactions between relevant parties. However, Commercial Bank gave no indication as to when that trial would begin.

42379422,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87l3L,1491854463,UK Finance Watchdog: No Need to Rewrite Rules for DLT,"A top UK finance watchdog said today that it has no immediate plans to alter its regulatory approach in light of blockchain adoption.  By way of a new discussion paper, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is seeking comments from industry stakeholders and observers in order to ""explore where the balance of risk and opportunities may lie in relation to [distributed ledger technology]"".  The agency – which operates a so-called regulatory “sandbox” that includes a number of companies working with the tech – said in the paper:  ""At this stage we do not see a clear need to consider changes to our regulatory framework for DLT solutions to be implemented. Instead we want to explore emerging business models, and how their potential risks and opportunities operate in the context of our regulatory framework.""  Elsewhere in the paper, the FCA said that it wanted to adopt a ""neutral"" stance in regards to the technology, looking to police the companies that utilize it instead. Early last year, an FCA official said that the agency wanted to give the ecosystem of developers and companies working with blockchain ""space,"" citing the early stages of development.  That said, it’s not out of the question that the FCA could look to rework is approach to regulating the market in light of future potential adoption. This work, too, could be impacted by international regulatory work being conducted between the FCA and other organizations of its kind.

42379427,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87l77,1491849964,Indian Narcotics Agent Accused of Stealing Seized Bitcoins,"Reports are emerging that an agent for an Indian law enforcement agency has been arrested for stealing bitcoins tied to a drug bust.  According to the Times of India, an officer for the Indian Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) is alleged to helped steal more than 400 bitcoins originally confiscated during a 2015 seizure. Specifically, investigator Satyendra Kumar Singh is said to have been accused of unfreezing those funds at the behest of one of those arrested.  The media source claimed that it was the first such case in India – though the cryptocurrency world is no stranger to rogue agents siphoning bitcoins obtained during criminal investigations.  The NCB reportedly alleged that Singh consulted with Deepak Manguikya, one of the accused drug dealers, after he was released on bail in 2016. In July 2016, Singh then helped Manguikya forge documents which would allow for the unfreezing of the accounts where the bitcoins were stored. After being unfrozen, the accounts were emptied and liquidated with Singh allegedly receiving 50% of the proceeds.  Officials noticed the missing coins while working on a report regarding the status of the seized funds. Subsequently, the NCB moved to suspend and arrest Singh, and an investigation into his role in the heist is said to be ongoing.

As reported by Reuters, Fidelity is the first asset manager to join the Initiative for CryptoCurrencies and Contracts (IC3), launched several years ago with funding from the US National Science Foundation. The firm's technology-focused arm, Fidelity Labs, will join the team which includes Cornell University, University of California at Berkeley, IBM Corp and Intel Corp.  Hadley Stern, SVP for Fidelity Labs, told Reuters:  ""What IC3 brings is that academic computer science legacy that can help us explore how this technology can be applied.""  Fidelity's entry into the IC3 project follows years of growing interest on both the bitcoin and blockchain fronts.  In February  , the firm submitted a patent application outlining its so-called ""SOCOACT"" technology, which among other applications could find use as a means to deploy blockchain-based elections.

The disclosure came in a Hong Kong legislative document published by the Legislative Council Panel on Financial Affair this week and dated 18th April.  According to the note, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), which acts as the region's central bank and finance regulator, is working with Hong Kong Interbank Clearing Limited (a clearinghouse in which it has an ownership stake), several undisclosed banks and distributed ledger startup R3 on the initiative.  The document explained:  ""The first phase of the research, which explores the feasibility of [central bank-issued digital currency] in performing domestic inter-bank payments, inter-corporate payment in the wholesale market and delivery versus payment (DvP) debt securities settlement, is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of this year. Subject to the findings of the first phase, HKMA will map out the next steps.""  That the HKMA would pursue this line of inquiry is perhaps unsurprising. A growing number of central banks worldwide, including those from Canada, Singapore and the UK, have launched similar initiatives in recent months. The HKMA recently revealed that it had completed a trade finance project alongside a group of banks and R3.  The HKMA is expected to complete the proof-of-concept by the end of this year, after which further steps may be taken toward developing the digital currency project.  The institution is also planning to publish more of its internal research in the months ahead, with a new white paper expected to be released next quarter.

42379432,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87lEf,1491832516,Porsche Seeks Blockchain Companies for Startup Competition,"German automaker Porsche is looking to explore blockchain technology.  According to a company release, Porsche quietly unveiled a startup competition last week aimed at attracting firms that work with the tech as part of a bid to weigh potential applications.  It's the first time Porsche has made public its interest in the technology.  The automaker is offering €25,000 in prize money as well as a three-month stint at SpinLab, a Leipzig-based accelerator it backs. Applications for the contest are due by 15th May.  The company said in a statement:  ""Porsche aims to obtain external input on the disruptive potential of the blockchain transaction system by collaborating with the start-up scene. The central question is to what extent the application of this technology in the value creation chain of the company makes sense. Moreover, other forms of potential long-term collaboration will be investigated.""  Porsche isn't the first automaker to start exploring the tech for possible uses.  In February, Daimler AG announced that it was joining the Hyperledger project. At the time, the company said that, in its view, blockchain is ""a promising technology, not fully mature yet, but continuously growing"".

42379426,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87l5r,1491829236,"Mirai, The Infamous Internet of Things Army, Can Now Mine Bitcoin","Remember that Internet of Things botnet? The one known for temporarily shutting down a number of the world's largest websites last autumn?  Well, a newer version has been detected, but as well as being able to issue DDoS attacks and the like, it's equipped to mine bitcoin.  In the digital age, it's possible for hackers to infect and take control of insecure Internet of Things (IoT) devices, say, toasters, cameras or other web-connected devices. They can then bundle them together into a botnet, using their combined capacity to shoot spam at websites or internet structures, slowing them down or sending them offline.  That's what happened in a series of attacks in the fall, using the malware dubbed Mirai.  The software was open-sourced soon after – much to the dismay of security engineers – and, since then, different strains iterating on the first version of the botnet have cropped up with added abilities.  One strain, known as ELF Linux/Mirai, has now been detected mining bitcoin for a few days, according to research from IBM X-Force, the Big Blue's cybersecurity research wing. It seems some unknown hacker (or hackers) is experimenting with using the power accumulated from IoT devices to mine the digital currency and possibly make some cash.  This could be an omen for future IoT botnet use cases, argued Dave McMillen, IBM Managed Security Services senior threat researcher and author of the report.  McMillen told CoinDesk:  ""This ELF/Mirai variant could be appealing to others in the future due to the potentially large volume of devices that could be involved.""  The researcher noted, however, that, the botnet didn't appear to successfully mine any bitcoin. The security team see it more like a peek at a down-the-road possibility.  Mining 'blip'  So, what happened, and how did IBM spot the mining component of the botnet?  McMillen explained, saying:  ""We detected a spike in command injection activity in our IBM X-Force monitored client environment data that prompted deeper investigation.""  The security team saw traffic related to an ELF 64-bit binary file., which the report describes as beginning as a ""blip"", which grew in volume by 50%, but had fizzled out by day eight.  The team ""dissected"" the binary to discover that the Linux version of the malware is similar to the more typical Windows version.  ""It was detected as a slave miner by multiple tools, however we are still investigating other properties of the variant,"" McMillen added.  While there are now many variants of the botnet, ELF Linux/Mirai has extra abilities in that it can execute 'SQL injection' (a notorious way to take control of databases) and execute so called 'brute force' attacks.  But, the Linux version has an extra add-on – the bitcoin miner component (which you can see online here).  Future threat?  IBM speculates in the report that the botnet creators may be looking for a way to make bitcoin mining with compromised IoT devices a lucrative venture.  ""Realizing the power of Mirai to infect thousands of machines at a time, there is a possibility that the bitcoin miners could work together in tandem as one large miner consortium. We haven't yet determined that capability, but found it to be an interesting yet concerning possibility,"" a blog post explains, adding:  ""One scenario could be that while the Mirai bots are idle and awaiting further instructions, they could be leveraged to go into mining mode.""  Although this idea is admittedly speculative, the report points to the fact that bitcoin has been used for other cybercrimes – such with ransomware, which encrypts all of a user's computer data with a demand for payment – because it's decentralized and is perceived as a more privacy-enhancing currency.  The tech can have more beneficial uses cases, though. For example, one company recently revealed aims to build a bitcoin botnet to help secure IoT devices, combining the cryptocurrency with technology also has the potential for less beneficial online activities.  Simple defense  So, how can users protect their internet-connected toasters from being enlisted as a bitcoin mining slave?  The Mirai malware exploits a surprisingly simple attack vector.  The problem is that many IoT devices come with pre-installed passwords. And, since many users never change them, all an attacker needs to do is find the default password to 'hack' into the devices.  McMillen’s advice is for users to change those passwords. Though, he said that he hopes that IoT companies are beginning to tackle the problem, too.  He concluded:  ""Manufacturers could be looking for ways to manage these credentials more securely, perhaps by prompting a forced change or randomizing the default logins.""

42379429,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87l9d,1491826503,Who Needs VC? Ethereum and the JOBS Act Could Change Investing,"Finance is already on the verge of being disrupted, thanks to blockchain platforms like ethereum.  But now that regulatory easing brought on by the JOBS Act in the US is starting to play a role, venture capital itself could be the next industry to undergo radical change in the face of new, blockchain-based business models.  Already, San Francisco-based VC firm, Blockchain Capital, is on the verge of offering a tokenized security to accredited investors.  But, based on details of the investment opportunity released last week, it now appears co-founder Brock Pierce stopped short of what he believes is the full potential of the offering.  First revealed in March, the firm's venture fund is designed to let initial investors trade tokenized shares on exchanges long before more traditional venture capital shares typically mature.  Built in compliance with SEC regulations, and established under Singapore's blockchain-friendly legislation, the tokenized securities have the potential to lower the threshold for investors that want a slice of startup risk and reward, while making liquid assets that are typically locked down for years.  But there is a catch: of the estimated 8.5 million accredited investors in the US, only a small portion will legally be allowed to participate, as a result of SEC restrictions, and only about 8.25% of US households qualify as accredited investors in the first place.  To truly tap into the full potential of the model, Pierce said entrepreneurs would have to do something he himself was unable to do – legally open up securitized tokens to non-accredited investors.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Pierce said:  ""That’s the only one other nuance that you can bolt on. The trade-offs are more cost [and] a greater degree of disclosure, but the benefit is non-accredited investors. It allows you to make a true retail offering to the world.""  A new kind of company  Pierce believes an explosion of venture capital could be freed up by following just a few steps that integrate cutting-edge regulation with blockchain tech.  To give an idea of how much money could be opened up, while there was only about $100m raised last year from so-called independent coin offerings (ICOs), there was $132bn raised from independent public offerings (IPOs).  However, it is at the intersection of these worlds, where crowdfunding meets blockchain, that the true power of the technology could still be waiting to be tapped.  ""I have a problem with the traditional venture capital model,"" said Pierce, arguing that it creates a ""club"" of people with access to deal flow.  He added:  ""I don't think that's what’s good for the world in the long term.""  No 'Crypto-Valley'  While some of the potential impact on venture capital remains untapped, the building blocks are already being tested by Blockchain Capital's Digital Liquid Venture Fund.  For starters, Pierce argues the entity – in this case a fund – has to be set up in Singapore.  While the Zug region of Switzerland known as 'Crypto-Valley' has been home to many ICOs, Pierce said that jurisdiction is a poor choice for several reasons.  First, Switzerland doesn’t usually allow foreign law firms to operate in the country. Secondly, the so-called 'use coins' like ether that also help power blockchain applications, aren't typically defined as securities.  Pierce also expressed concerns over the nature of the regulations themselves. While he is concerned that Switzerland's permissions could be changed ""in a day"", he expects Singapore’s controls will be around for the long haul.  ""Switzerland is an island, and it's not an interoperable island,"" Pierce said. ""Singapore actually has real stuff on the books and it's designed for any token.""  Sweet spot  Whereas ""location, location, location"" is frequently bandied about as the most important building block for a young company, this new breed of venture capital firms is a bit more complicated.  Previously, companies like Kickstarter and Indiegogo allowed ""backers"" to donate money to projects they liked in exchange for ""rewards"", such as a free T-shirt or dinner with the founders.  But Blockchain Capital's partner in the launch of its securitized ICO, blockchain investment bank Argon Group, further narrowed the opportunity for upstart venture capital firms using the JOBS Act, signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2012.  Whereas Blockchain Capital followed the more traditional framework of issuing securities to accredited investors under SEC Regulation D, the CEO of Argon Group, Stan Miroshnik, explained to CoinDesk that the JOBS Act could let non-accredited investors participate in crowdsales in exchange for actual stock in a company.  The so-called 'regulation crowdfunding' provision allows for up to $1m a year to be crowdfunded in exchange for securities to be raised under strict conditions of disclosure.  The smallest salary earners are restricted to a $2,000 investment.  Miroshnik described the future impact such investment vehicles could have:  ""This is a new corporate finance tool, it’s a new funding tool, and venture capital firms are going to run into it on the funding side. But, also, as these companies mature down the road, they’re going to find things on the cap table, on the balance sheet.""  VC firms as middlemen  For now, Pierce said unaccredited investors will have to wait to get in on the potential rewards (and risk) of investing in startups in exchange for a security.  Following The DAO, a failed attempt to cut venture capitalists out of the picture altogether, bitcoin entrepreneur Charlie Shrem briefly launched an ethereum-based platform aimed at giving private equity investors a way to invest in startups, also in exchange for actual stock in the company.  However, that project was shelved earlier this year, marking the latest in a series of struggles to rethink venture capital on a blockchain. For his part, Pierce has embraced a more incremental approach.  On Friday, Blockchain Capital revealed the names of some of its earliest investors – well known members of the blockchain community including ConsenSys' Andrew Keys, Bloq's Matthew Roszak, and Civic's Vinny Lingham.  The intention is to increase the tokenized portion of his Fund III from about 20% of the total raise this time around to 50% in Fund IV. Further, the fund could completely switch over to a tokenized investment round by the fifth round.  Even as Pierce pushes deeper into tokenized securities, though, he said what he's able to do as a fund will likely always be limited.  With concerns over disclosure requirements that resemble that of public company, he explained that it’s unlikely his accredited investors will ever be open to participating in a fund that’s available to everyone.  Argon Group, meanwhile, has decided to focus mostly on helping companies raise a Series B of $6m or more, leaving a window of opportunity for upstart investors.  Pierce predicts that the model of merging US-based JOBS Act provisions with Singapore’s legal infrastructure could increase the number of ICOs from about 60 last year to 300 in 2017, and double that the year after.  With an estimated $32bn raised on crowdfunding platforms around the world, according to a recent report, Pierce expects there will eventually be entrepreneurs who will accomplish what he was unable to do.  ""The legal structure can be copied by anyone,"" he said, concluding:  ""We don’t own it. This is a gift.""

42379442,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87lPz,1491824114,Bitcoin Tops 3-Week High As Price Inches Upward,"In the face of continued division over its technical roadmap, the price of bitcoin has responded by creeping closer to all-time highs.  Following positive sessions over the weekend, the price of bitcoin hit a high of $1,219 to start Monday's session, reaching a total the market hadn't seen since late March. At press time, the price of bitcoin was trading at $1,216, slightly below that figure.  The three-week high observed is the highest figure since 16th March, when bitcoin hit a high of $1,260 amid a period of heavy volatility. (The day's low was $1,132, a differential of more than $100 for that day's trading).  Yet, indicators suggest it's not yet clear exactly which direction the bitcoin price is heading.  On Friday, for example, bitcoin faced heavy resistance at the $1,200 level and struggled to move upward. This was despite 80% of the market entering buy orders at 20:00 UTC, according to data from BFXdatahttps://www.bfxdata.com/orderbooks/btcusd, a service that tracks trading activity on Bitfinex.  Today, that indecision seems apparent once again, as 24-hour trades favored buy orders 61% to 39%, while 1-hour order book activity favored sellers 56% to 44%.  The price increase further comes amid a decline in exchange-traded bitcoin volume from peaks observed in the wake of a US regulator's decision to reject a retail investment product focused on the technology in mid-March.  Roughly 100,000 bitcoins have been traded in the last 24 hours, with Bitfinex, OKCoin and Kraken observing the most activity during this span.

42379441,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87lOj,1491822011,Vitalik Buterin Doubles Down on Ethereum Incentive Strategy,"On the first day of the Financial Cryptography and Data Security conference in Malta, an academic with a cryptography career spanning three decades ended his keynote with a caution.  Incentives should be used as a last resort, said MIT professor of engineering Silvio Micali, pointing to bitcoin and its industrial mining pools as an example of what can go wrong when people find ways to make money that nobody could have predicted.  But not everyone shares that view on incentives.  Fast forward to the Workshop on Trusted Smart Contracts at the tail end of the conference, and another keynote address.  This time, the speaker is someone with no formal background in cryptography. Yet, his success in creating one of the world’s largest blockchains, second only to bitcoin, is hard to ignore.  As he spoke to the audience, Vitalik Buterin, the creator of ethereum, argued that, not only do incentives play a key role in securing the blockchain, they are also the reason bitcoin soared to success when decades of previous attempts at peer-to-peer currency failed.  With that, he launched into a discussion on smart contracts and mechanism design that in some ways contrasted with, but in other ways built on, what Micali had said at the event.  Encouraging altruism  Simply put, mechanism design is a field at the crossroads of game theory and economics that looks at how incentives can be used to achieve favorable outcomes. In the blockchain world, that means getting people to play by the rules.  But, as anyone who has followed the discussions on consensus algorithms knows, this is an incredibly difficult thing to do.  It also underscores the onerous job ethereum is up against as it designs a proof-of-stake system to replace the existing proof-of-work protocol that underlies its own blockchain.  So, it is no surprise Buterin is thinking so much about mechanism design and its impact on the stability of blockchains, and particularly on his smart contracts platform, ethereum.  One way to look at mechanism design, Buterin said, is through a framework of what he called 'crypto-economics', a term he credits his colleague Vlad Zamfir for coining. Buterin went on to explain how cryptography and economic incentives come together to play a critical role in keeping a blockchain secure.  Cryptography, he explained, allows users to prove properties of messages in the past. For example, digital signatures allow you to authorize messages, hash chains let you prove one message came before another and zero-knowledge proofs preserve privacy.  Buterin told attendees:  ""You can use all of these [cryptographic] tools basically to prove things that happened in the past according to a certain set of rules.""  In contrast, economic incentives, he said, guarantee that the desired properties of a blockchain will continue into the future.  Further, the idea of combing cryptography with economic incentives was Satoshi Nakamoto's real stroke of genius, he said, and the reason why bitcoin has become so ""large and successful"".  Layers and gadgets  Buterin went on to describe the two ""layers"" of a blockchain: a bottom layer that consists of a consensus algorithm and an upper layer that includes things like smart contracts, gadgets and channels, like Lightning Network.  'Gadget' was another new term that Buterin defined as a “mechanism that gets used by other mechanisms”. One example of a gadget would be an oracle, which a smart contract uses to access information from the outside world.  As the ethereum creator explained, there are two ways to look at the smart contract layer: one way is to assume the bottom consensus layer works fine and view both layers as separate; another way is to analyze attacks on both layers simultaneously.  And, it is entirely possible, Buterin said, for an attack in the smart contract layer to permeate down to the consensus layer.  The rest of Buterin's talk focused on the various attacks that can happen at the smart contracts layer and how incentives work to secure the blockchain.  A means to an end?  But while incentives, as Buterin argued, may have led to bitcoin’s $20bn market cap, one has to wonder, if bitcoin’s success is also leading it to a kind of slow demise.  Arguably, incentives in bitcoin have led to a non-stop arms race and turned the issue of scaling into a civil war that threatens to split the community.  It is clear Buterin and his team are working hard to get away from mining by planning a switch to proof of stake. But the question that comes to mind is, does proof of work present the danger – or does that threat lie more inherently in incentives, as Micali pointed to?  Because, if incentives are the problem, ethereum may be veering from one path, only to venture down the dark corridor of another.  And, if incentives are not the problem, than Algorand, the proof-of-stake system that Micali is designing to have no incentives (if he can pull it off), may stagnate and never get off the ground.

42379434,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87lHB,1491818404,Why a Quiet Blockchain Consortium Could Soon Make Noise,"Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis, corporate finance and fund management, and a member of CoinDesk's product team.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom newsletter delivered every Sunday to our subscribers.  While high-profile consortiums such as Hyperledger and R3 are bulldozing along to big fanfare, a relatively small effort is quietly working on a project whose repercussions could soon be felt around the world.  Last year, a group of 10 asset managers and fund service providers based in Luxembourg created Fundchain, a sector consortium aimed at exploring the potential impact of blockchain technology on the fund management industry.  Although launched with little noise, its potential is huge.  Luxembourg currently has the second largest investment fund sector in the world behind the US, and a 65% market share in cross-border fund distribution.  What's more, asset management is set to reap the benefits of certain economic trends (a growing middle class in emerging markets needing outlets for their savings) and demographic shifts (an ageing population leading to growth in pension funds).  Regulatory boost  Amidst this backdrop, an upcoming piece of legislation is set to buffet the industry with a sweeping change that will produce upheaval and possibly contraction.  I'm talking about Mifid II. It's hard to overstate the impact these regulations will have on asset management.  Due to come into force in January 2018, Mifid II aims to increase transparency, enhancing investor protection and removing shady practices in pricing and allocation. Fund managers will be required to pay separately for research, financial advisers will no longer earn a commission and reporting requirements will multiply.  And that's just scratching the surface.  An independent report estimates the cost of complying with Mifid II to be more than £2.5bn. This is likely to bring about a sector shift, with many smaller firms not being able to bear the cost, and larger enterprises offsetting the increase elsewhere.  Even more worrying, a recent survey showed that most sector participants are not prepared for the changes.  Where blockchain fits  Although it will only affect funds domiciled in Europe (for now), the repercussions will be felt around the world.  Luxembourg is the seventh largest foreign holder of US treasury securities, and over 20% of funds listed in the country are promoted by US companies. Further, the duchy is the largest European domicile for Islamic funds and the continent's top renminbi (yuan) center.  So, here we have a highly regulated sector that has to overhaul a manually-intensive, inefficient and sometimes opaque system of managing documents, reporting information and transferring value.  At the same time, there is an urgent need to reduce operating costs across the board, to offset the loss of revenue and increased compliance expenses.  The ideal solution? A sector-wide system that can leverage transparency, reliability and connectivity. Plus, a way to share pricing and identity data without the risk of interference or centralized control.  The long game  This is where what Fundchain is doing gets interesting.  In December of last year, the consortium unveiled a proof-of-concept for a distributed ledger platform designed to smooth the operations of transfer agents, who act as intermediaries between investors and distributors on the one hand, and the fund managers and service providers on the other.  This week, the consortium revealed in an interview with CoinDesk that it is working on four other blockchain use cases, and aims to bring one of them to production by early next year.  While the full-scale substitution of current systems by a relatively new technology is unrealistic (and unwise, given the systemic importance of the transactions and the integrity), the need for an efficient and future-proof solution is obvious.  It’s not just about complying with new rules. It's about surviving.  Asset management accounts for over 50% of Luxembourg’s economy. Should the sector crack, so would the region, and the repercussions would be felt around the globe.  On the other hand, if Luxembourg’s fund managers, service providers and regulators manage to adapt and implement a new type of interaction, the sector could be poised to harness the financial trends that point to an even greater role for wealth management in the world economy.  All this from a tiny country that is home to a small, modest consortium doing something potentially very big.

42379431,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87lFv,1491814808,"DTCC Vice Chairman Calls for Single, Global Distributed Ledger","One of the most powerful people at the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) has aired a lofty vision for the future of blockchain and distributed ledger tech.  While he kept the door open to multiple directions going forward during a recent address to the US Treasury Department, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, he made clear his vision for a single, shared ledger that unites the global financial infrastructure.  Reading from a prepared speech at the third joint workshop, ""Setting Global Standards for Granular Data,"" DTCC vice chairman Larry Thompson described the potential benefits of moving every global derivatives user to a single distributed ledger network.  Thompson said:  ""All of us here have discussed how standardization across repositories and jurisdictions is a precursor to effective global data sharing. Agreeing to one common ledger could end the discussion.""  Already, the DTCC is making progress towards moving its own, significant, share of the global market to a blockchain solution, typically thought of as a sub-set of the distributed ledger technology Thompson mentioned.  As part of DTCC's own push into blockchain, the settlement platform is in the process of moving $11tn worth of its derivatives processing to a blockchain by next year.  Then, in February, the firm entered its second phase of a separate project with Digital Asset to potentially move the time-consuming process of its repo services to another blockchain.  While a single blockchain could potentially increase the network effects enjoyed by each participant, several solutions such as Interledger and Cosmos are seeking to simplify blockchain interoperability by helping create what is being referred to as the 'internet of blockchains'.  To give an idea of the potential influence Thompson's organization could have, the DTCC transacted $1.5qn worth of global transactions in 2015, according to its most recent annual report.  Further, Thompson reiterated the often cited statistic that the DTCC’s Trade Information Warehouse processes about 98% of credit derivatives around the world.  But with an estimated $20qn in the global OTC derivatives market, there's still a long way to go to achieve Thompson’s vision, and the going could be tough.  Speaking in Frankfurt, Germany, on 29th March, Thompson described collaboration among industry consortia in the field as ""considerable"". But he also noted that technology firms and vendors have been ""jockeying"" to position themselves as the technology provider of choice.  Thompson concluded by describing his vision for a connected, global, financial infrastructure if developers agree on a standard:  ""We are a long ways away from this outcome, but it can be realized. It would take disciplined coordination and a disciplined insistence on common standards to achieve.""
