42379564,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX88dOR,1498768243,Miners Boost Ethereum's Transaction Capacity With Gas Limit Increase,"Ethereum miners are raising the network's transaction capacity, a move that comes amid criticism about blockchain congestion.  Network data shows that the gas limit of ethereum's transaction blocks has been on the rise since earlier today. Gas is a kind of computation cost within ethereum, which users pay in order to issue transactions or perform other actions on the network. A higher gas limit means that more more actions could be performed per-block.  According to data on ethereum statistics provider Etherchainhttps://etherchain.org/charts/gasLimit, the increase started around 9:20 UTC, crossing the 5m mark just before 11:00 UTC. At press time, the network's limit is roughly 6.3m gas, representing a roughly 33% increase overall.  Complaints about congestion have come about in light of recent initial coin offerings, during which a higher-than-average amount of transactions leads to longer waiting times for inclusion in a block, have led to calls from some segments of the ethereum community for the gas limit to be increased. Both the cost of gas itself as well as where the limit ought to be set has implications for the network's functionality as well as its decentralization, as previously explored by CoinDesk.  Yet some miners were initially slow to adopt the raised gas limit despite calls for an increase, as a higher limit can increase the frequency of uncle blocks, or blocks that are mined but don't form the longest chain of transactions. Unlike bitcoin's orphaned blocks, ethereum's uncle blocks are compensated.  The gas limit increase comes as the ethereum network continues to see a rise in the total amount of transactions per-day. Data from Etherscan shows that on 26th June, the network saw 316,788 transactions, the most-ever recorded on the network.  Concurrently, the amount of gas spent on transactions has also continued to climb. Per Etherscan, 15.2bn gas was spent on transactions on 27th June. The highest amount recorded to date, 16.9bn, was reported on 22nd June.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Etherscan.

Set for July 18th, the US Federal Blockchain Forum is being organized by the General Services Administration (GSA) and the State Department.  The goal, according to an announcement post from DigitalGov University (a federal staff training group), is to develop a six-month plan for ""how agencies can collaborate to achieve our goals and support the creation of shared services for blockchain technology"".  Both the GSA and the State Department, among other parts of the US government, have made public their work with blockchain, with the former recently seeking price quotes on an integration of the tech into its contract award process. The State Department revealed that it formed an internal working group focused on blockchain earlier this month.  The event is a notable one for the prospects of public-sector applications of the tech, as the event's organizers hope to encourage officials that are attending to effectively start mapping out how blockchain could be applied for their specific purposes.  ""In order to participate in the forum, agency teams must submit a potential use case for Blockchain technology in your mission,"" the announcement reads.

42379558,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX88dKf,1498754412,Russia Wants Regulators to Research Blockchain Security Risks,"The Security Council of Russia wants to see more research conducted into the security risks of blockchain, according to a government statement published today.  The group, comprised of ministerial offices and agency heads related to national security, is chaired by Russian President Vladimir Putin. The statement, per a rough translation, indicates that the Russian government wants to resolve ""a number of significant...issues associated with information security"" as segments of the country's financial sector move toward adopting the tech.  The council's Interdepartmental Commission met to discuss the matter, though the exact timing of the meeting isn't immediately clear.  The announcement signifies the latest blockchain-related development within the highest echelon of Russia's government. Dmitry Medvedev, who serves as prime minister, has spoken positively about the tech and in March ordered several offices to begin researching public sector applications. Putin himself recently met ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin during a recent event.  Statements from Russia's Communications Ministry suggest that Russia could implement blockchain-related rules in the next two years, even though the country has yet to conclude a long-running effort to regulate bitcoin and other digital currencies.  Recent news reports indicate, however, that the digital currency rule-making process may be moving ahead.  Talking to Russia's international news agency RIA Novosti, Vadim Dengin of the State Duma, the lower house of the national parliament, said he believes hearings could begin soon on bills related to digital currency in spite of some internal resistance.

42400081,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzaqQ,1498750517,Arizona Bitcoin Trader Charged With Money Laundering,"A bitcoin trader and advocate in Arizona has been charged with operating an unlawful money transmission business.  Thomas Costanzo, who runs a bitcoin services website that offers sales for bitcoin mining equipment and ATMs, was arrested in late April and initially charged with the unlawful possession of a firearm, which resulted from a previous conviction.  A new superseding indictment, unsealed this week, reveals that the government is pressing charges against Costanzo related to his digital currency activities. Costanzo was accused of exchanged $166,000 with undercover agents between May 2015 and April 2017, funds that were ""represented by a law enforcement officer to be proceeds of specified unlawful activity"", according to the indictment.  Court documents show that another individual, Peter Steinmetz, is also being charged. Costanzo and Steinmetz were each charged for running an illegal money transmission business. Costanzo was additionally charged with money laundering and felony possession of a firearm.  In April, local and federal law enforcement officials raided Costanzo's residence and later had him held following an initial hearing. Police records published at the time showed that officials included bitcoin and digital currency-related items in their warrant, suggesting at the time that they might press for charges beyond the gun-related one.  The court case is the latest in the US to involve a bitcoin trader or seller who is charged with unlawful money transmission. In some of those instances, undercover investigators would purchase bitcoins from those targeted in the sting operations.

42400095,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzb2E,1498746909,Fidelity Charitable Has Raised $9 Million in Bitcoin So Far in 2017,"Fidelity Charitable, the donor fund connected to mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments, raised nearly $9m in bitcoin during the first half of this year, according to its annual report.  After raising $7m in bitcoin during 2016, Fidelity Charitable recently experienced a marked uptick in donations, bagging roughly $2m more than that figure in the last six months alone. The annual report further revealed that ""nearly $2bn"" has been committed by all funding methods since the start of the year.  ""This is more money given to charities over the first half of the year than ever before in the organization’s 26-year history,"" the organization said in the report.  The disclosure comes weeks after Fidelity's CEO took the stage at CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 blockchain conference to discuss the firm's deep interest in the technology, particularly in public blockchains and cryptocurrencies.  Fidelity's charity effort first began accepting bitcoin in late 2015, pitching the concept as a way to expand the possible donor pool by opening up to less traditional assets.

42400094,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzb1F,1498741205,Pot-Friendly Bitcoin Startup Raises $1.5 Million,"POSaBIT, a Seattle-based digital currency payments startup with a focus on serving legal cannabis outlets, has raised $1.5m in funding.  The round included participation from a number of Seattle-based angel investors, whose identities were not disclosed, as well as New York-based investment firm Digital Currency Group.  The funding will go to advancing POSaBIT's business development efforts, according to a statement. The startup also provided some details on adoption of its payments platform and sales in Washington state, which legalized marijuana in 2012.  ""Already, over 25 stores in the state of Washington have used the POSaBIT platform to provide secure and efficient payment solutions to their customers, and those stores have already processed more than $2m in sales via digital currency,"" the firm said.  In line with its mission, POSaBIT was among those to notably speak out earlier this year when legislators in the state of Washington considered banning local cannabis firms from accepting bitcoin.  Though that measure ultimately failed, POSaBIT's team argued that its approach to payments meant that store owners could be less dependent on cash – as they largely lack access to the banking system due to federal statutes – thus reducing the risk of theft.

42400087,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzavL,1498738240,Bitcoin Scaling Project Segwit2x to Release New Code Today,"Segwit2x, a controversial scaling proposal largely backed by the bitcoin network's enterprises and miners, is moving ahead in adherence with its previously announced timeline.  In an email yesterday, Bloq co-founder and Segwit2x lead developer Jeff Garzik confirmed to CoinDesk that new code is set to be released on Friday, following two weeks of alpha release testing. The release is said to address issues and comments on the initial version.  As such, the release is expected to mark a new phase for the proposal, which has been praised by some as a pragmatic solution to the network's perceived capacity issues and derided by others as a deal that misunderstands the nature of bitcoin development and the network's intended design.  Still, it has emerged as unique, given that it was able to bring together perhaps the largest contingent of companies and mining pools ever in support of a scaling proposal. Further, its support by a large majority of miners means, if released, the code could quickly gain the necessary backing from the network to activate the upgrade.  If development continues as planned, bitcoin’s long-requested scaling optimization SegWit could be activated before August, with a hard fork to double the block size slated for three months later. This change, though, also remains a matter of controversy and critique.  Testing phase  So far, little is publicly known about the testing process.  According to those involved, the last two weeks of development have been dedicated to testing, with the firms involved using a new testnet (""testnet5"") and a so-called faucet that spits out fake coins to test the system.  A notable change this week was that the team tweaked the details of the hard fork portion of the agreement for the time being  Companies involved in the project – including Abra, Bitfury, Blockchain, BTCC, OpenBazaar, Purse and Xapo – have been contributing to development and testing, though it’s still not public who's working on what.  From the SegWit2x GitHub site, it is apparent that developers have been testing the code. Purse CTO Christopher Jeffrey, for instance, identified and fixed some bugs during this two-week stage, while others flagged and put forth other ideas.  Some companies are playing a smaller role in the effort. For example, OpenBazaar's lead backend developer, Chris Pacia, said that he is the sole developer from the firm to contribute to the project. He explained that he created a testnet5 DNS seed (which helps new nodes connect to the test network) and has offered occasional feedback.  However, a few of the firms that pledged to assist in testing the code have been hesitant to reply to requests about their involvement. (Some critics have gone as far as to argue that the firms involved are ""corporatizing"" bitcoin, asserting that Segwit2x is a small group of companies in an invite-only Slack channel attempting to govern a decentralized online currency.)  Remaining questions  So, with the beta release almost here, what's next?  According to the schedule, mining pools are supposed to install the software on 14th July, which they can use to signal support for the upgrade after 21st July.  Last week mining pools representing 80% of the bitcoin hashrate agreed to run the code that could lock in SegWit before 31st July. After that, three months later, is the planned hard fork to boost the block size. Of concern, is that the fork could potentially result in a split into two competing tradeable bitcoin assets if not everyone agrees to upgrade their software to the change.  While this is the plan for later in the summer, bitcoin developer James Hilliard mentioned that the details of the 2MB hard fork portion are still up for debate.  ""It’s unclear what the details are,"" he told CoinDesk.  Hilliard, who's contributed code to Segwit2x that might help to avoid a split into two assets, is skeptical of the hard fork timeline, calling it ""unrealistic"" – a sentiment shared by other Bitcoin Core contributors, who nearly universally reject the SegWit2x project.  Developers have proposed various ways of doing the hard fork portion of the code, though Hilliard said it would be possible to wait and finish the code and logistics for increasing the block size parameter after SegWit activates.  As usual, users will have to wait and see how this will unfold, and for now, speculate on the possible outcomes and their impact.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which acted as organizer for the Segwit2x proposal, and has ownership stakes in Abra, Bloq, BTCC, Purse and Xapo.

42400089,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzaxJ,1498734002,Bitcoin Phishing Scheme Perpetrator Pleads Guilty in Connecticut Court,"A Connecticut resident pleaded guilty this week to fraud and money laundering offenses committed as part of an elaborate effort to steal cryptocurrency.  In Hartford Federal Court on Tuesday, 35-year-old Michael Richo of Wallingford, Connecticut, admitted to stealing $365,000 in bitcoin through a phishing scheme in which he posted fraudulent links designed to resemble popular dark market websites, according to a release from the US Department of Justice.    Prosecutors found he later used this information to monitor the bitcoin accounts and balances of victims. Richo admitted he stole over 10,000 usernames and passwords in such a method, using these to sell the victims' assets on bitcoin exchange platforms for US currency.      No details were provided as to the nature of the accounts that were compromised, and whether they were software wallets (in which the users controlled their funds) or hosted wallet services (where the bitcoins in question were maintained by a company).      Still, the guilty plea advances a case that began when Richo was arrested last October on charges of computer fraud, wire fraud and identity theft. Ultimately, he pleaded guilty to one count of money laundering and one count of device fraud – charges that carry a maximum sentence of 30 years of imprisonment.      Richo is scheduled to be sentenced in September.

42400103,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzb88,1498726886,Celebrity Investor Mark Cuban is About to Participate in His First ICO,"Mark Cuban doesn't seem worried that initial coin offerings (ICOs) might someday render investors redundant.  In fact, the ""Shark Tank"" VC is so open to the nascent blockchain use case, that he's joining the ranks of traditional investors who support the idea that their own portfolio companies could raise additional capital by selling cryptographic tokens.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Cuban portfolio company Unikrn is currently circulating an update to its investors about a forthcoming ICO intended to supplement the venture capital it has already raised.  Unlike other more tentative investors, which have shown a reluctance to participate directly in the actual token sales, Cuban said he will participate in the offering – a first for the owner of the Dallas Mavericks NBA franchise.  Cuban described his thinking to CoinDesk:  ""High risk. High reward.""  Natural progression  Founded in 2014, the Seattle-based Unikrn is an e-sports betting platform that has already raised $10m from investors also including Ashton Kutcher, Elisabeth Murdoch and 500 Startups, to let anyone in the world bet with ""Unikoins,"" the firm's own digital token, or with fiat money in Australia and the UK.  In the year since the token launched, Unikrn has transacted over 250 million unikoins, according to the company's founder, Rahul Sood, who tells CoinDesk the plan was always to switch the coin to a more secure cryptographic token.  The 1 billion new tokens – called UnikoinGold – that will eventually be minted will adhere to the ERC-20 ethereum standard and, based on a timeline in the investor update, the formal marketing of the token will begin no later than August. A launch of the live coin integrated with an underlying infrastructure and wallets is set to go live on 31st August.  An excerpt from the investor update revealed a breakdown of how shares of the tokens are expected to be allocated:  In addition to demonstrating the increasingly supportive stance taken by traditional investors toward ICOs, this latest development shows another trend of venture backed, non-cryptocurrency startups converting company tokens into cryptocurrency that can be exchanged more widely into ether and ultimately fiat.  Earlier this month, social network Kik announced its own ICO, a development that comes even though it has raised $120m in traditional venture capital.  But Cuban thinks tokens that would be used to fuel online gambling are especially well suited to be converted to cryptocurrency.  ""Growth in gambling is going to accelerate,"" Cuban told CoinDesk. ""Unikrn is better positioned than any other company to leverage that growth not only with their core business , but with blockchain.""  He concluded:  ""The ICO opportunity is a perfect fit.""
