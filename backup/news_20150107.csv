42426244,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJGMDh,1420670416,Bitcoin Broker LibertyX Raises $400k for Hiring Push,"LibertyX has raised more than $400,000 in funding from early-stage VC firm Project 11 as part of a seed round and its first public fundraising.  Previously operating under the name Liberty Teller, LibertyX formally rebranded this December. The name change coincided with a shift in the company’s services, from operating a small fleet of bitcoin ATMs in the greater Boston area to adding an in-person bitcoin buying network supported by 2,500 US merchants.  Co-founder Chris Yim explained that the capital will be used to grow the LibertyX team, which today consists of just three employees, while expanding its presence in the US.  Yim told CoinDesk:  ""We've bootstrapped everything to-date and I am proud of what we've accomplished with just the three of us. This round will allow us to add staff to help address the growth we are experiencing across the board.""  LibertyX has already put the funding to use since it was completed on 22nd December, hiring a dedicated CTO to the team. Yim said additional staff will be added in 2015.  The company is formally registered under the name Moon, and an SEC filing for the deal reveals the total funding received was $404,104.  With the move, LibertyX joins additional Project 11 portfolio companies including online catering company Phoodeez, location analytics company Locately and electronic tipping startup DigJar.  Capturing market interest  Operational for roughly one year, LibertyX has also arguably benefited from its early and timely entrance into the bitcoin market.  As Liberty Teller, for example, the group launched what is considered to be the second bitcoin ATM ever installed in the US in Boston’s South Station last February. A Lamassu model that debuted in a cigar bar in New Mexico, and was later removed, is believed to be the first.  Controversy aside, the group has remained relevant, strategically placing machines in high-profile locations near the tech-friendly campus of MIT at a time when bitcoin activity on the campus has been of international interest.  The company has also struck key partnerships both as a graduate of the MassChallenge startup accelerator and a partner of transaction processing specialist Qpay, which enables it to reach an extensive network of retail partners in its home market.  Opportunity for ATM operators  As LibertyX has quickly expanded beyond owning and operating four bitcoin ATMs, Yim expects that the move is a sign that other ATM owners may begin to announce more ambitious plans.  “Most operators today manage few machines where external funding is not necessary. But, I believe it's only a matter of time,” Yim said, alluding to new funding rounds that could occur in 2015.  Though he sees much opportunity in the space, Yim also suggested that this window of opportunity could be limited, as he predicted increased VC interest would coincide with a consolidation of market participants.  First introduced in late 2013, the bitcoin ATM sector experienced an impressive year of growth in 2014, expanding from just a few units to hundreds around the globe.  More data regarding bitcoin ATMs can be found in CoinDesk's ""State of Bitcoin 2015"" report.

42426249,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJGMNh,1420667719,Cubits Launch Aims to Accelerate Bitcoin Buying in Europe,"Cubits has launched a web application designed to speed up and simplify bitcoin transactions.  Notably, the London-based cryptocurrency startup allows customers to buy bitcoin in minutes, making it one of the fastest digital currency platforms in Europe, according to the company.  ""We want to speed up the process of getting bitcoin and making online payments fair and accessible, especially for merchants and charities that could really benefit from lower fees,"" said Andreas Lehrbaum, co-founder of Cubits and the co-founding chairman of Bitcoin Austria.  Focus on speed and accessibility  The first products based on the new platform are a consumer-focused wallet and a merchant payment system called Cubits Payhttps://cubits.com/merchant, which have been in beta since October last year.  The company said both products were designed with ease of use in mind, so the user interface is geared toward mainstream users as much as early adopters.  For security, Cubits indicated that customers' bitcoin funds are stored in offline cold storage and all transactions require multi-signature authentication.  Although much of the focus is on Europe, Cubits supports instant payment options and bank transfers in 17 different currencies, including euros, US dollars, British pounds, Turkish lira, Polish zloty and others. Support for additional currencies is also on the way.  Users can choose one of three different instant payment providers – SOFORT Banking, OnlineBankTransfers(OBT) or OKPay to buy bitcoin.  Julian Mautner, co-founder of Cubits, explained the process:  ""The user specifies an amount of fiat to be converted to bitcoin and finalizes the purchase via the selected payment provider. The payment provider interfaces directly with the users' online banking account and notifies Cubits about the payment. Bitcoin will then be credited to the user immediately. We have partnered with several banking institutions who support us with both SEPA and international payments.""  If the account is already funded, the exchange is instantaneous.  Free currency conversion for merchants  Cubits Pay was designed for merchants with a global audience, the firm says, allowing them to leverage bitcoin’s low transaction fees and offer an alternative to credit cards and other established payment options. The service offers free conversion into any supported fiat currency.  The platform features a number of plugins for a wide range of popular shopping cart systems, as well as free customer support. Tailored solutions for retailers interested in incorporating bitcoin payments are also available.  Cubits is privately funded by the company’s management team, David Julian Mautner, Tim Rehder, Andreas Lehrbaum and Benedikt Manigold, who have prior experience in IT, finance and startup ventures.  The team says it is committed to creating a “strong and secure bitcoin marketplace” and intends to use blockchain technology to take part in the transformation of international payments  The company has offices in London and Berlin. Cubits is registered in the UK as an IT payment service provider.  European exchanges race to cut transaction time  Speed is becoming a significant differentiator in the industry, especially in the European market. A number of exchanges have already introduced fast payment options, allowing customers to buy bitcoins faster than ever.  Last month Swedish bitcoin exchange Safello partnered with an unnamed British bank to offer faster transfers to UK-based customers. London-based exchange Yacuna also announced a new service, allowing UK customers to use SOFORT Banking for GBP deposits to its trading platform.  The only downside of using fast or near-instant services like SOFORT is the relatively high cost, as withdrawals and transfer fees tend to come at a premium. For example, Yacuna users can expect to pay a 4.90% fee on SOFORT deposits, along with a 3.00 GBP withdrawal fee.

42426250,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJGMPh,1420664801,GAW Miners and the Disappearing $20 Paycoin Floor,"GAW Miners' controversial plan to provide market support for the value of its bitcoin competitor has recently come under fire from customers, critics and community members.  At issue is that, in contrast to bitcoin's decentralized network, in which no companies or entities have overarching control of the market, paycoin could arguably be seen as a more centralized alternative.  In addition to managing the development of the decentralized paycoin currency, GAW Miners operates a paycoin brokerage (PayBase), an exchange for the currency (Coin-Swap) and a network of coin-generating wallets – an ecosystem that many suggest counters the decentralized spirit of the cryptocurrency movement.  Opponents claim that GAW Miners and its CEO, Josh Garza, reneged on promises to back the coin at $20 on the open market, as well as a broader commitment to provide a mechanism – the floor – that was meant to shield it from market speculation.  By contrast, GAW Miners argues that the plan to ensure customers can ""use your paycoins in PayBase at a $20 value” was attacked by groups opposed to the success of its project. GAW has since issued a statement on the subject of how the $20 valuation was reached.  Furor over the floor support and $20 value recently dominated the front pages of r/bitcoin and elicited comment from several notable figures in the industry.  Since then, the company has seen businesses like exchange service ShapeShift drop support for paycoin, while a growing chorus has called for Garza to cancel an appearance at the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami, Florida, of which it is a sponsor. Sensitive customer information was also exposed during a PayBase security failure on New Year’s Eve.  Complicating the situation has been the sometimes rabid anti-GAW sentiment that has pervaded bitcoin websites and forums. In turn, the company's backing by experienced inter-dealer broker Stuart Fraser, confirmed by the Wall Street Journal, casts doubt on accusations the company is a scam.  The debate  Underlying the debate is a lack of clarity among some in the community on whether GAW and Garza definitively committed to the floor and its $20 value, and if they did, how long such a price support mechanism was meant to be enacted.  Signs that GAW staff and representatives have edited, deleted or restricted access to content that could prove significant to the ongoing discussion have also complicated matters.  Ultimately, the plan to institute the floor was put aside after what the company described as uncontrollable paycoin sales volume and concerns that GAW could be held liable for manipulating the market should it become more involved with its actions in the market.  A review of posts from Hash Talk, as well as insights gleaned during a new interview with Garza, suggests that GAW actively used language that was likely to invoke the idea of both the floor and the $20 value when pitching the project.  By directing the development of the coin and establishing an online platform that conducts market operations across all exchanges, GAW sought to make known its strong presence in the market.  In the run-up to the launch of PayBase, Garza divulged market movements, indicated that so-called ""whales"" were about to enter the market, and used language that, while inconclusive but unquestionably energetic, is suggestive of the pump-and-dump culture that GAW said it sought to fight with paycoin's stability mechanism.  Forum posts suggest that GAW had reason to suspect that customers and observers were perhaps misunderstanding GAW's claims regarding its intentions in the market, as well as the relationships that would add value to its core products. However, the firm did not act to put the record straight.  The misconceptions extended past paycoin. The idea that retail giant Amazon may partner with GAW to accept paycoin for purchases in particular had been circulated by Hash Talk users, but according to Garza, GAW opted not to correct prior misconceptions about the anticipated partnership because “we thought it would add more issues to things, so we just ignored it and just moved forward"".  Garza explained:  “What was happening at that time behind the scenes, we bought a company at the time that made that announcement that had the relationships with those merchants to be able to allow us to technically or programmatically be able to fulfill those purchases.”  Garza's comments suggest that perhaps overenthusiastic community members could have also played a role in shaping the public discourse about its market movements.  “That was another miscalculation,” he continued. “I didn’t realize that people would continue to talk about it over and over and over and it would snowball into something much bigger than we intended it to be.”  GAW's original post on the subject of the floor could be seen as an indicator that it was aware that perception about the project was perhaps being distorted.  Origins of the floor  Garza told CoinDesk that GAW never explicitly committed to buying paycoins at $20 without question.  He suggested that assumptions about the floor mechanism spread among customers and acknowledged that GAW “should have done a better job of managing” customer expectations about the exact nature of the stability mechanism. Today's statements could be seen as a move to correct this.  Garza informally announced a public offering of what was then known as 'hashcoin' for a suggested price of around $20 in late October.  During this period, more details about the coin emerged and a development roadmap was released that included the $20 public offering price.  Plans for a coin adoption fund were also disclosed. According to the plan shared with customers prior to the launch of paycoin, the fund's purpose is to “provide a safe floor price”, as well as facilitate other projects like developing apps, building data centers and developing relationships with merchants.  The hashcoin ICO thread linked above is currently unavailable, but a pair of Hash Talk posts from 31st October include a number of customer questions that Garza answered on the subject.  On 28th November, a question-and-answer session hosted by Garza on Hash Talk focused on GAW's HashStaker service and involved another reference to both the market floor support and indications of a $20 value.  The floor in action  On 22nd December, Garza published a post on the company’s Hash Talk forum entitled 'Spread the Word' in which he referenced the much-discussed $20 floor he and his company have invoked both prior and since to the launch of paycoin.  In the post, Garza told users that the company was beginning to institute the floor:  The use of these measures was first disclosed on 22nd December, when Garza indicated that trading bots controlled by GAW were actively participating in the paycoin market on cryptocurrency exchange Cryptsy.  At 2:40 AM EST, Garza wrote:  In a post a half-hour later, Garza wrote that “my little bots are everywhere”, and at 3:22 AM EST corrected a user who said the market moves were related to recent announcements by the company:  “Just made another wall on cryptsy,” he wrote one minute later.  In a currently restricted post entitled “GAW is About to Move the Market”, Garza outlined the push in some detail:  That morning, Garza wrote that GAW would be using its resources to push the price higher than the $20 floor and suggested that the purpose of doing so was to avoid technical challenges.  When asked about disclosing the PayBase purchases to customers, Garza argued that leaving indications about the deployment of market-stabilizing mechanisms was ""appropriate"", telling CoinDesk:  “I think that if you’re going to go out and buy a significant amount of paycoins and you have a community that is invested in paycoins, it seems appropriate to let them know. There’s a good chance that that’s going to change the price because of how many you need to buy, it seems appropriate to let them know that before you do it, so they have the opportunity to purchase more or sell them if [they] want to.”  “We’re in the kind of a unique position because we’re aligned with the coin,” he continued. “Unlike BitPay or Coinbase, where the coin that they use in their system is independent of them.”  On the 22nd, Garza also pointed to the involvement of large investors with outsized influence in a marketplace owing to their significant buying power, telling Hash Talk users that undisclosed market movers were getting into the market.  “I just had all our 'whales' contacted,” he wrote. “They are moving in.”  Garza told CoinDesk that the whales constitute a network of individuals connected to GAW composed of those “significantly invested in paycoin”, noting:  “It’s a touchy situation, because we don’t want to get into a scenario where we’re making large purchases behind the veil without letting people know because if we do that, we think we could see a reason why a customer would have a problem with that.”  “Every time we’ve done a significant purchase, or a significant sale, we’ve let customers know about it,” he said.  On the 22nd, customers received an email from GAW's cloud mining platform, ZenCloud, which said that the current market conditions were “the last opportunity” before the market floor was expected to be put in place. That night, GAW announced it would delay the launch of PayBase.  In a post that, at the time of this writing, is unavailable for public viewing, Garza outlined the reasoning for the delay and emphasized the promise of the project, including a commitment to charge no fees at launch. He also suggested that the trading methods previously deployed would be temporarily slowed until the PayBase launch.  Garza told CoinDesk that early market activity using the trading bots was, at the time, a process to acquire paycoins prior to the launch of PayBase. Garza stood by the decision to both inform customers about the market deployment, and called the move by PayBase to end plans for a hard floor “a way to clarify our position”.  “We want to send a clear message that the value of paycoin ultimately needs to be driven from the utility and use of paycoin, versus doing one thing on one market versus another,” he said.  Twilight of the floor  On 30th December, Garza posted on Hash Talk that he would cease providing information on GAW’s actions in the paycoin market. However, he alluded to preplanned market support prior to the PayBase launch, writing:  The next day, PayBase beta invites were distributed to users. In a launch message posted by Garza, he stated that GAW had “moved the market” and was honoring the $20 price.  “As of this writing, we have moved the market to above $20 to create the floor, just like we said we would,” he wrote. “Should there be a rush on PayBase, we will hold the value of paycoin with our existing resources.”  In a post later that day, Garza outlined how plans to keep the floor at $20 were disrupted by high selling volume on the PayBase site, as well as a coordinated effort on the part of malicious actors to drive the price below the floor using previously accumulated paycoins, citing evidence collected by GAW staff.  Documents provided to CoinDesk by GAW point to posts by a Bitcoin Talk user bragging about past and planned market actions, as well as IRC comments outlining the potential for investors to sell in big numbers amid market highs.  Garza wrote  to customers at the time:  “I always said two things. We would buy paycoins at $20, or we would use our resources to manage to $20. They both mean the same thing. We will do everything in our power to make the price $20. And that's what we are doing.”  He disclosed that GAW had expended significant amounts of money during the process and implored customers to decide whether they supported the long-term vision of paycoin.  “I’ve made my choice,” he concluded.  Floor fallout  In the following days disagreements rose among customers of GAW, as well as observers in the cryptocurrency community, as to whether the company was turning its back on a commitment to keep the price at $20.  It was during this time that calls for Garza to drop out of his speaking slot at The North American Bitcoin Conference first arose, prompting organizer Moe Levin to ultimately arrange a question-and-answer session, which is set to take place during the Miami-based bitcoin conference.  On 3rd January, ShapeShift announced that it would be withdrawing support for paycoin. The exchange stated that GAW had failed to fulfil “a guarantee” to shore up the value at $20. The move followed calls from some community members to boycott exchanges that listed paycoin.  “People make business mistakes all the time, and it doesn't mean its a scam,” ShapeShift founder and CEO Beorn Gonthier told CoinDesk at the time. “But deleting former promises is unacceptable, and we couldn't in good conscience continue listing paycoin on ShapeShift.”  The growing fallout has also ensnared at least one exchange that previously saw significant paycoin volume. Coin-Swap, which according to a recent CryptoCoinsNews report was purchased by GAW, received requests from representatives of several altcoin communities to have their coins delisted from Coin-Swap.  Representatives from the blackcoin, dogecoin, litecoin and neoscoin communities cited concerns that GAW would use its ownership stake to influence the price of paycoin.

42426234,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJGLth,1420656129,Gold Dealer Amagi Metals Now Pays All Staff in Bitcoin,"Precious metals dealer Amagi Metals announced it is now paying its entire staff in bitcoin via payroll service provider Bitwage.  The move forms part of the company's plan to 'divorce' the US dollar by 2017, where it will stop accepting the fiat currency as payment method.  Amagi Metals  has worked with bitcoin for two years and, according to company data, 30-40% of its costumers currently pay with the digital currency.  Speaking to CoinDesk, CEO Stephen Macaskill said he wanted to find a company that could handle bitcoin payroll seamlessly and test it with his own paycheck. Later, he put the proposition to others at Amagi:  ""I made a comment about it at a staff meeting and was surprised, and excited, to find out that everyone was really eager to go full steam ahead with this. So we made this as a voluntary option, and everyone jumped on board immediately!""  Every employee at Amagi Metals has set a percentage of their paycheck, both big and small, that they wish to be paid in bitcoin. To demonstrate his support, Macaskill will personally be paid roughly $40,000 of his salary in bitcoin this year.  Despite the challenges posed by operating a business with bitcoin, Macaskill expects a higher degree of stability in the long run. He said:  ""Bitcoin volatility may have concerned me a year ago, but now there are so many different options to hedge bitcoin against fluctuations, that I'm not too concerned. I also think that if you're in it for the long run, it is inevitable that volatility will continue to drop as adoption grows.""  A popular paycheck  Many other bitcoin-friendly companies have already adapted to a bitcoin payroll. At wallet provider Blockchain for instance, all workers are paid in the digital currency. A survey from Bitwage last year revealed that 47% of bitcoin companies are open to paying their employees in the digital currency.  One of Amagi's competitors, Bullion Bitcoin, has been paying all of its employees' salaries in bitcoin since the company was set up in 2013. Founder Adam Cleary told CoinDesk he welcomes Amagi Metal and other businesses to the community:  “It helps to contribute to build the bitcoin ecosystem if people are willing to treat bitcoin as a currency in its own right and to accept it as a mean of payment.""  Bullion Bitcoin is an online exchange for physical gold bullion and bitcoin, and it deals with no fiat currencies. Cleary said that no employee has yet asked to have their salary paid in fiat money, and ended:  ""Our staff think it's cool. We all believe in bitcoin here.""

42426247,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJGMJh,1420650008,Coinbase Unveils iOS and Android App Redesign,"Coinbase has launched its redesigned Android and iOS mobile apps, allowing users to instantly buy and sell bitcoin in 19 countries.  The California-based bitcoin services provider indicates that both apps have been rebuilt ""from the ground up"" on the latest versions of both platforms.  In addition to the updated buy and sell functionality, Coinbase users can request bitcoin from other users using a bitcoin address, email or QR code; shop with merchants who accept bitcoin; and access their full Coinbase account and transaction history.  Further, Coinbase indicated that the apps come with enhanced security features, including Touch ID support for iOS and enhanced PIN lock functionality.  Coinbase’s iOS app currently has a user rating of three-and-a-half stars, while it’s Android app has garnered a higher, four-star score.  The redesigned apps come amid a flurry of app activity from leading US bitcoin companies, including BitPay and Circle. BitPay yesterday launched a Windows version of its multisig wallet app Copay, while Circle added near-field communication (NFC) functionality to its Android app.  Navigating the app  Users who log into the Coinbase app will first need to enter their Authy two-factor identification code, a feature no doubt familiar to desktop users.  From there, users are taken to a home screen that displays their wallet and vault balances. Select US customers may also be able to view their USD wallet balance, a new feature it rolled out to residents of 16 US states in December.  The wallet section displays the user's recent activity as well as their current balance in bitcoin and their local currency.  The Coinbase app is now available in Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the US.

42426251,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJGMRh,1420643933,State of Bitcoin 2015: Ecosystem Grows Despite Price Decline,"CoinDesk    CoinDesk is pleased to announce the latest quarterly State of Bitcoin report, featuring a 2014 Year in Review, an in-depth analysis of data and events from the fourth quarter of 2014 and a look ahead to what 2015 might bring.  Overall, 2014 could be characterized as a ‘Tale of Two Bitcoins’.  On the one hand, significant bitcoin venture investment continued and much progress was made in furthering adoption, particularly in bitcoin payment acceptance by big brand names such as Microsoft and Dell.  On the other hand, early on in 2014, the collapse of Mt Gox dealt a crippling blow to bitcoin’s extraordinary price momentum. Bitcoin’s price dropped 67% in 2014 from $951.39 to $309.87 (Slide 7) and so far in 2015 it has plunged a further 18%.  Overview  Sustained downward price pressure will likely result in consolidation amongst exchanges and other players sensitive to the price of bitcoin.  Trading and transaction volumes continue to increase  Total bitcoin trading volume on exchanges increased by more than 50% in both BTC and USD terms (Slide 8). While bitcoin may have been the worst performing currency in 2014, it also continues to be the most volatile currency, creating opportunities for speculators.  In the fourth quarter, monthly exchange volume surpassed the previous high in 2013, reaching a peak of around 17 million in November. Daily bitcoin transactions also passed 100,000 for the first time in the fourth quarter. However, questions linger over how significant a milestone this is, given uncertainty over how many of these transactions are bona fide economic activities.  All-time bitcoin startup VC investment crosses $400 million  The fourth quarter saw a record-setting $130m of new venture capital invested in bitcoin startups – nearly double the $64m raised in third quarter.  To date, a total of $433m has now been invested in bitcoin startups since 2012, with 77% of that total ($335m) coming in 2014 alone (Slide 10).  The 2014 publicly disclosed VC investment in bitcoin startups also equals three times more than the total investment VCs made in bitcoin startups in 2013.  The number of countries that received VC investment grew from 8 to 18 in 2014, with half of the new countries receiving VC investment in 2014 located in Europe.  Total VC investment in 2014 well exceeded the $250m invested in first-sequence Internet startups in 1995. Looking ahead to 2015, 83% respondents of CoinDesk's Bitcoin Thought Leader annual survey expect bitcoin VC investment in 2015 to surpass the level of investment made in 2014.  The informal Bitcoin Thought Leader survey was sent to a relatively small number of bitcoin community influentials. Respondees included Gil Luria, David Yermack, Izabella Kaminska, Jon Matonis, and others.  More commerce and consumer traction  In the fourth quarter, Microsoft became the largest retailer by far to begin accepting bitcoin for payment for Xbox games and mobile content (Slide 47).  CoinDesk is forecasting that the number of merchants accepting bitcoin will grow to over 140,000 at the end of 2015. However, the rate of growth in the number of bitcoin-accepting merchants slowed over the last quarter (Slide 46).  There were 1.4 million new bitcoin wallets created in Q4, representing 21% growth quarter-over-quarter. CoinDesk is forecasting 12 million total bitcoin wallets by the end of 2015 (Slide 49).  Technology  In the fourth quarter, bitcoin network difficulty declined for first time in two years (Slide 56).  As CoinDesk previously outlined, a drop in difficulty was anticipated given bitcoin’s depressed prices. With rumours circulating around one previously announced M&A deal in the mining sector running into trouble, we expect a further shakeout amongst bitcoin miners should prices remain low or decline further.  Security is the key concern in bitcoin development. Companies across the ecosystem are collaborating on security to improve customers’ confidence. For example, more than 5% of bitcoins are now secured with multisig technology.  Regulation and the big picture  The fourth quarter saw some regulatory clarity, with welcomed revisions to the New York 'BitLicense' and no new major regulatory setbacks for bitcoin.  The Bitcoin Thought Leaders survey revealed that international remittances are viewed as one of the most compelling bitcoin use cases for 2015. When factoring in average remittance fees, the revised Bitcoin Market Potential Index reveals that Sub-Saharan Africa is a very fertile region for bitcoin adoption (Slide 75).  At the same time, Africa is the region where bitcoin has to date received the least regulatory attention (Slide 76). However, very few bitcoin startups are based in Africa or pursuing the use of bitcoin there.

42426237,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJGLzh,1420629070,ICE3x Launches Nigeria's First Bitcoin Exchange,"South African bitcoin exchange ICE3X has launched bitcoin trading in Nigeria for the first time, opening up a potentially huge market for bitcoin in Africa's most populous country.  The company has formed an exclusive partnership with Nigerian payment processor VoguePay, allowing users to buy and sell bitcoins using the local currency, the naira, directly from existing VoguePay wallets.  ICE3X  is also planning to roll out merchant services allowing local businesses to accept bitcoin.  Breaking new ground  Speaking to CoinDesk, ICE3X (pronounced 'ice-cubed X') founder Gareth Grobler described Nigeria as ""virgin territory"" for bitcoin, with only a small number of traders and hobbyists involved so far.  ""The market, however, is potentially massive. VoguePay have spotted the opportunity bitcoin offers, seeing as one of the primary attributes of bitcoin is its security. Nigerian online consumers simply do not have the same access to goods and services from international vendors due to one simple thing – credit card fraud. Bitcoin solves that problem.""  Setting up in the country was ""pretty straightforward"", Grobler added, saying it was simply a matter of expanding the business and infrastructure ICE3X already operates in South Africa.    By building a more advanced online payment system in Africa, a VoguePay spokesperson said, the company will pave the way for young African entrepreneurs to foster better business relationships, making the online markets more accessible to millions of Africans.    VoguePay's executive and research teams are based in Canary Wharf, London, while its development, operations and professional services groups are located in Nigeria's largest city, Lagos.  Massive youth market  Nigeria has over 177 million people, 33.6 million of whom are in the 18–35 age bracket, making it home to one of the largest youth populations in the world. Depending on the statistical methods used, it is also considered Africa's largest economyhttps://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ni.html.  According to the Nigeria Communications Commission, in June 2013, the country had 48.1 million active Internet subscriptions through mobile phone networks, yet ICE3X says this space has been largely ignored by the digital currency advocates.  Setting up a bitcoin exchange may have been the easy part, though – Nigeria may have other hurdles to overcome if it is to participate in the global bitcoin economy.  It is the country that gave name to, and is synonymous with, the notorious '419 scam' phenomenon, which should be familiar to anyone who has ever used email.  Bitcoin may not be able to prevent such crimes from occurring, but it's important to remember 419 scams have operated just fine for decades in the fiat currency space without bitcoin's help.  Additional security measures enabled by bitcoin, such as multisig wallets and escrow accounts, could help overseas customers transact with legitimate Nigerian businesses with greater peace of mind.  That's exactly the problem bitcoin solves, Grobler said.  ""The idea is that, for example, a farmer in Nigeria can buy a tractor from a supplier in the USA, and both parties could benefit from the near instant, secure and transparent funding solutions underpinned by the bitcoin technology.""  Future impact  It is ""only natural"" for Nigeria to want to take part in these new opportunities, he continued, and is a market that simply cannot be ignored any longer.  This is true even if bitcoin is not quite ready for everyday use as money.  ""We have to be realistic though, bitcoin technology has yet to be packaged and applied correctly for it to be a mainstream alternative currency, but as an agnostic payment settlement mechanism within a larger framework it ticks all the boxes and could perhaps have a significant impact on shaping the Nigerian digital economy landscape.""  Building a solid customer base in Nigeria aligns with ICE3X's longer-term product development strategy to have a robust, well tested infrastructure from which to launch its solutions.  ICE3X ""cannot forsee"" entering any additional African markets at this stage, Grobler said, but does plan to launch a USD market later this month.

42426246,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJGMHh,1420624170,Roger Ver Denied US Visa to Attend Miami Bitcoin Conference,"Bitcoin entrepreneur Roger Ver has been effectively locked out of his native USA after this week being denied a non-immigrant visa for the third time.  Ver, who publicly gave up his US citizenship in 2014, was planning to speak at the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami from 16-18th January.  He tweeted the following message to his 18,800 followers:    While forcing me to pay taxes @USEmbassyBbdos tyrants won't allow me to attend #CES2015, #TNABC or anything in the US pic.twitter.com/8dl6qpPjUM      — Roger Ver (@rogerkver) January 6, 2015      Ver told CoinDesk that despite rejecting his application three times at $160 per application, officials have refused to examine documentation and evidence he provided to support his case.  While it is not possible to appeal against the decision, Ver is permitted to apply again from scratch.  Illegal immigrant concern  The official reason for rejection, as stated by the US embassy in Barbados, was that Ver could not demonstrate sufficiently that his ties to any country other than the US were strong enough for him to leave the US.  The rejection stated:  ""One of the most common elements within the various nonimmigrant visa requirements is for the applicant to demonstrate that they have a residence in a foreign country which they have no intention of abandoning ... You have not demonstrated that you have the ties that will compel you to return to your home country after your travel to the United States.""  Effectively, the Immigration Service is concerned that he may try to overstay his visa and become an illegal immigrant in his home country.    Embassy officials reportedly refused to even look at documentation regarding the business Ver started in Japan in 2006, or any of the other nine years worth of history he has with that country.      ""They wouldn’t even let me slide the documents regarding Japan through the slot in the window,"" he added.    Ver's parents, siblings and extended family all live in the US, including one uncle he says ""has stage-four cancer and the odds are very bad"".  Former US citizen  Famous for his libertarian/anarchist political views, Ver became a citizen of the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis, a small Caribbean nation, in February 2014 and handed in his US passport a month later.  A frequent attendee and guest speaker at bitcoin conferences worldwide, he makes a point of wearing a 'borders are imaginary lines' T-shirt when going through immigration at airports.  Asked whether his decision to renounce his US citizenship might have been a mistake in hindsight, he said:  ""I checked with lawyers very carefully before I renounced, and they clearly assured me that I will qualify for a visa to visit the USA. I would be fine with them denying my visa if it was for a valid reason, but they are either lying, ignorant, or stupid when they claim that I plan to secretly overstay my visa and live as an illegal immigrant in the USA.""  Ver initially left the US almost nine years ago, after serving a 10-month prison sentence and three years' probation for selling agricultural firecrackers online. Since then he has resided mainly in Japan, and has not visited the US for nearly a year.  Despite his record, Ver said he has not had difficulty gaining access to any other country, including the notoriously strict Japan.
