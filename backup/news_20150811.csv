42398564,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbaDDq,1439329207,"Bitcoin and Credit Cards Can Co-Exist, CardLinx CEO Says","While last week's Keynote 2015 conference saw the introduction of new voices to the conversation surrounding bitcoin and blockchain technology, none may have been heard louder and with more skepticism than CardLinx CEO Silvio Tavares.  Tavares used his forum at the conference to discuss his organization's focus on developing standards for promoting card-linking, a process by which the consumer data managed by payment companies is shared with merchants to target discounts and rewards. Founded in 2013, CardLinx boasts founding members including Bank of America, Facebook and Microsoft.  Given that the attendee base was composed of many from the bitcoin and blockchain industry, it may not be surprising that attendees greeted Tavares' positive appraisal of the credit card industry with skepticism. At the event, Tavares sought to attack the idea that credit cards aren't affordable and don't offer privacy, and further, that the payments industry isn't innovative.  In interview, Tavares expanded on this view further, asserting that contrary to their perception in bitcoin and blockchain circles, payments companies are innovating at a faster rate than ever, creating a higher hurdle for new technologies.  Tavares told CoinDesk:  ""If you think about payments and digital advertising, there's enormous innovation transforming how people find and pay for services and the business model for how traditional payments work. ... There's a huge amount of innovation in the space and that's both a challenge and opportunity for bitcoin.""  A former senior vice president at Visa and First Data, Tavares added that in this current environment dominated by payments innovation, being safer and cheaper hasn't been enough to propel the technology to the mainstream.  That's not to say that Tavares doesn't believe there will be applications for bitcoin in payments, it's just that he believes the technology is still searching for a niche.  ""I don't see bitcoin as replacing card payments anytime soon. I don't see bitcoin replacing card-linked capabilities anytime soon,"" he said. ""But, I think that technologies like bitcoin and credit cards can co-exist and complement one another.""  The comments follow increasing debate about the strength of bitcoin's value proposition to merchants following reports of declining adoption and a broader shift in interest toward the technology's applications as a distributed database.  Awareness a non-issue  One indication that the technology is still not ready for mass market as a payment method, Tavares said, is that adoption has been disproportionately low when compared to public interest.  ""You can hardly look at The Wall Street Journal, Businessweek or Harvard Business Review without reading an article about bitcoin. Bitcoin is everywhere, but yet we haven't seen consumer adoption,"" Tavares said.  Tavares indicated that, part of the issue, is that consumers perceive bitcoin as more difficult to use than other forms of payment. The assertion is backed by recent studies, like one in April that found bitcoin was perceived to be the ""most inconvenient"" payment method.  He went on to call ease of use and small merchant acceptance the biggest issues with bitcoin and its applications for payments, even though he acknowledged how integration has been added by companies such as PayPal, Shopify and Stripe.  ""At the end of the day, merchants want to accept as many payment methods as possible, but if it's hard for them to implement, it becomes a challenge,"" he said.  Trust and control  Tavares also framed bitcoin as a potential complement to payments industry practices like card linking, suggesting that, while this process relies on information sharing, the pseudonymity bitcoin offers isn't a roadblock to such use cases.  Rather, Tavares asserted that consumers want to control how they pay, so long as they're also able to share relevant information with select parties as well.  ""Consumers want to be able to control how they pay, but they also want to share this information with people who deliver value. I think consumers are not so focused on maintaining anonymity, they want to have anonymity with the right people,"" he continued. ""Consumers like privacy, but they don't want to live in cloaked world where no one knows who they are.""  Tavares suggested that card linking has struck this balance by enabling consumers to elect who they share data with in exchange for a quantifiable reward. However, he said he doesn't foresee a blockchain removing the role of trusted intermediaries, even in the exchange of data for rewards.  Time and education, he said, will need to play a role as other industries are just realizing one of the core innovations of the blockchain is its ability to reduce or eliminate trusted counterparties in the transaction process.  ""When you look at the blockchain as a counterparty, you're putting your faith in the wisdom of the crowd and that's not a very well established model yet,"" he said. ""People place their trust in institutions and companies and they're used to that because they see how that works.""  Innovating at scale  That said, he believes incumbent payments providers currently have two huge advantages in that they have capital and established user bases on which to test new ideas. Many of the challenges bitcoin and blockchain companies are working on, he said, are being attacked by firms with bigger budgets and more resources.  For example, when asked about the ongoing effort by Gyft to tokenize gift cards on a blockchain, he noted that there are other companies such as Raise seeking similar solutions for the same challenge – illiquidity in the gift card market.  ""It would be a mistake to think that the large companies are not already focused on those inefficiencies and investing heavily to solve them,"" he said. ""I do think there are going to be some opportunity for bitcoin as well, the key question is where is that going to be and where is it well suited to address challenges.""  More broadly, he noted that he believes bitcoin has already ""captivated"" the payments space, but that channeling this interest into business opportunities remains a roadblock.  ""There are a lot of great killer apps that are growing quite rapidly in the payments space,"" he continued. ""Given that we have 24 hours in a day, and you can only place your bets in a certain number of spaces, you want to base them in ones with acceptance.""  Promoting cooperation  Overall, Tavares said the goal of his speech at the Keynote event was not to antagonize, but rather to help a new generation of technology entrepreneurs learn how their space is being viewed by incumbents.  ""I wanted to share how much innovation there is in the traditional payments space, because I think that gives a perspective to bitcoin's value-add capabilities,"" he said.  Going forward, Tavares expressed an interest in having more bitcoin and blockchain companies join the CardLinx Association, given its broad interest in digital commerce.  Tavares believes that both technologies can thrive alongside each other given that, at the end of the day, both consumers and merchants are incentivized to use and accept as many payment methods as possible.  He concluded:  ""It's not just cards. This is really about digital commerce and how you can more effectively match merchants with consumers. That's why I'm very, very confident bitcoin can co-exist.""

42398556,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbaD6x,1439318097,GAW Miners Lawsuit Ends With $340k Default Judgement,"A Mississippi court has ruled in favor of a state electric utility in its case against defunct cryptocurrency mining company GAW Miners.  Mississippi Power Company (MPC) filed suit in April, alleging breach of contract after GAW Miners failed to pay for months of electrical provision as well as infrastructure installation. The utility initially sought $346,647.29 plus interest and court fees.  In a 10th August court order, US District Judge Keith Starrett granted MPC's request for default judgment. MPC is being represented by local law firm Balch & Bingham.  Starrett wrote:  ""Plaintiff, Mississippi Power Company, shall have and recover from defendant, GAW Miners, LLC, judgment in the sum of Three Hundred Forty-Six Thousand Six Hundred Forty-Seven and 29/100 Dollars ($346,647.29) together with interest on said sum at the legal rate per annum from the date of judgment until paid in full and for all of which let execution issue.""  GAW Miners and its CEO, Josh Garza, did not respond to the lawsuit, prompting the plaintiff to request a default judgment in June.  The company also failed to appear in a Connecticut civil case filed by two former GAW customers seeking to recoup losses related to its mining services and paycoin, an alternative cryptocurrency released by GAW late last year.  As a result, MPC said it will take action to collect on the judgement through continued litigation.  “GAW Miners failed to appear and respond to the lawsuit; therefore, Mississippi Power Company was awarded a judgment for all the damages it suffered. We will promptly pursue collection of the judgment through the judicial process,"" the company told CoinDesk.  Representatives for GAW Miners and Josh Garza did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

42398568,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbaDGn,1439313748,Bitcoin Remittance Startup 37coins Announces Closure,"Bitcoin remittance startup 37coins is closing its doors.  In a new blog post, the company said it was shutting down its service and its SMS-based wallet. However, users have until 30th December to withdraw their balances. More information about the withdrawal process can be found here.  The closure marks the end of a process that saw the startup take part in Plug and Play's bitcoin startup group. 37coins aimed to use low-cost cell phone technology as a means to enable cheap transactions, but according to the team, development ran into headwinds that ultimately proved insurmountable.  The post explained:  ""Despite the best of intentions, we were unable to deliver a quality product that showed product-market fit. We also found that SMS delivery between different carriers in countries outside the USA is unreliable. Lastly, our initial objective was not possible to achieve with the amount of capital raised.""  37coins also cited the growing focus of bitcoin projects that target the underbanked, and concluded by thanking those who had supported the project.  ""It has been a privilege getting to know all the bitcoin supporters around the world and to work together toward a fair and balanced financial system,"" the team wrote. ""Thank you for being such passionate supporters.""  37coins did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

42398569,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbaDHm,1439308992,PwC: Cryptocurrencies Will Create Technology-Driven Markets,"Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin will usher in a new wave of 'technology-driven markets', a new report from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) has claimed.  The 17-page primer, released by the firm's Financial Services Institute this month, says it is no longer a question of if cryptocurrencies will transform financial services, but when and how.  The report reads:  ""[Cryptocurrencies] have the potential to disrupt conventional market strategies, longstanding business practices, and established regulatory perspectives – all to the benefit of consumers and broader macroeconomic efficiency.""  PwC, a 'Big Four' advisory firm which operates in over 157 countries worldwide, has spent over two years monitoring the sector.  The report, Money is No Object: Understanding the Evolving Cryptocurrency Market, is one product of the 'cross-functional team' the firm assembled to evaluate the impact of cryptocurrency technology.  Others in the 'Big Four' have dedicated a number of resources to the emerging technology, with rival Deloitte revealing last month it was trialling blockchain systems in its client audits.  ""On the consulting side, I think we'll see the ecosystem adapt and change and move toward blockchain-based solutions,"" Deloitte's consulting principal Eric Piscini told CoinDesk at the time.  Growth spurt  While cryptocurrencies may threaten government control in the financial markets and revenue from transactions, PwC says, there are a number of opportunities too.  These include cheaper transfers and blockchain-based solutions for both the retail and financial services sectors.  The question of success, PwC says, will depend on how fast cryptocurrency markets – and startups – can grow.  ""As with most groundbreaking markets, the combination of ingenuity and speed to market is likely to distinguish the market leaders,"" the report reads.  It also identifies five market participants – consumers and merchants, developers, investors, financial institutions and regulators – that will create so-called 'credentialising moments' that will jolt cryptocurrencies further towards mainstream adoption.  Chief among these are consumers. While other stakeholders will help legitimise cryptocurrencies, ""[their] full potential ... may be realised only when the market makes the leap from the hands of investors into the hands of consumers,"" it reads.  Near-term challenges  Before adoption can happen, PwC outlines a number of near-term challenges that cryptocurrencies must overcome.  Bitcoin, for example, is simultaneously a currency, a financial asset and a technology protocol. Because of this, there is a danger the industry could 'splinter' in different directions, and fast, the report says.  This classification issue is also likely to discourage larger, risk-averse firms from using cryptocurrencies, as they will want to avoid violating SEC, CFTC or IRS regulations.  In conjunction with its report, PwC released the results of its survey of US consumers. Some 83% of respondents said they were 'slightly' or 'not at all' familiar with cryptocurrencies, while only 3% had used them in the last year.  This is in line with other surveys, which indicate cryptocurrencies are yet to appeal as a user-friendly service. In an poll on payment methods, 38% of respondents ranked bitcoin as more inconvenient than checks.  A Goldman Sachs report published in June found that over half of US Millennials would never use bitcoin.

42398570,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbaDEp,1439295346,BBVA: Blockchain Tech Could Replace Centralised Finance System,"Blockchain technology could be used to bypass today's centralised financial infrastructure entirely, according to a report by BBVA Research US.  The report, titled Blockchain Technology: The Ultimate Disruption in the Financial System notes that the application of blockchain technology would first be useful in the payments space, where it would eradicate the need for any intermediaries and significantly reduce costs for banks.  However, decentralised public ledgers could disrupt the financial system as a whole, adds the report. ""Given that the majority of financial assets such as bonds, equities, derivatives and loans are already electronic it may be possible that someday the entire system is replaced by a decentralised structure.""  Touching upon smart contracts, the report also noted how being able to register and trade assets on a decentralised register increases efficiency.  It adds:  ""In this environment, the current system where financial institutions record individual's accounts in a centralised fashion and the bank's reserves are stored by the central bank would be replaced by the 'Internet of money' or the 'Internet of finance' – a fully decentralised financial system.""  Challenges and risks  The possibility of a decentralised public ledger replacing the current centralised system, the report says, also comes with various risks and challenges.  Firstly, a decentralised system would have to offer the same or a higher level of trust and protection than the current centralised financial structure.  For this to happen, the report explains the decentralised system would have to concentrate a ""massive amount"" of computer power and in turn be able to cope with the huge energy consumption required to support it.  Furthermore, the decentralised system would also have to deal with legal and regulatory concerns, as well as with matters of national security, such as money laundering, fraud, tax evasion or terrorism.  The report notes that digital currencies could also suffer price volatility, which could have sizeable negative effects. ""These shocks could generate systemic risk and severe economic downturns ... in this scenario, monetary policy would not be able to respond effectively if it fails to boost demand among a large share of economic agents that use digital currencies.""  The risks aside, BBVA Compass believes blockchain technology has a bright future ahead. Its report concludes:  ""Therefore, the key question is not how, but when the disruption will become far-reaching. As other industries that have been transformed by new technologies and digitisation, blockchain technology could reshape the financial industry well beyond the payments system.""  BBVA and crypto  BBVA Research is the economic research department of BBVA Group, but this is not the first time the global Spanish banking group has entered the crypto arena.  BBVA Ventures, the private equity branch of BBVA, participated in Coinbase's $75m Series C funding round – the biggest investment in a bitcoin company at the time.  Just recently, BBVA's Open Talent competition – a global fintech startup competition – included nine crypto startups in its three regional finals.  BBVA Innovation Center also posted an online tutorial to inform consumers on the uses of digital currencies and give them a better idea of where these could be purchased.
