42431655,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4q9h,1585002103,Bitcoin and Gold: Evaluating Hard-Cap Currencies in Times of Financial Crisis,"How would a bitcoin economy react to coronavirus? For now, we don’t know. However, we can turn to a proxy for insight: gold.      Bitcoin’s (BTC) “digital gold” narrative has stuck well, namely because of the cryptocurrency’s low issuance supply schedule and a hard cap of 21 million bitcoins. In turn, theory on how a gold-based economy would react to an external shock such as the current global pandemic lends itself into a look at a future bitcoin economy.      As CoinDesk reported Monday, both bitcoin and gold rose on news of the U.S. Federal Reserve extending an indeterminate amount of aid to the private market. From a supply perspective, both assets sit still while the Fed feverishly tries to outpace COVID-19.      ""The Federal Reserve will continue to purchase Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning and effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions,"" the central bank said Monday.      With such a policy’s incumbent inflation concerns – where infinite supply depresses the value of the U.S. dollar – what would an alternative world look like? What would the macroeconomic story be in a world where bitcoin or gold was dominant as a means of exchange?    Gold during down times    For one, the value of a gold-based money would not artificially inflate, Mark Thornton, Austrian economist at the Ludwig von Mises Institute, told CoinDesk. (However, mainstream economists hold concerns that central bankers would have far fewer levers to pull in times of financial collapse.)      Like any market, gold’s value is determined jointly by supply and demand but has natural limits to the amount supplied in a given year. On average, the amount of gold mined per year hovers around 2 percent of gold’s total known supply.      Indeed, the price of gold has gone up in recent years mostly because gold is priced in dollar terms, Thornton said. As the amount of dollars on the market increases, so does gold’s price.      Additionally, gold – a safe-haven asset – acts as a hedge on inflation in financial crisis environments such as now. In the long run, bitcoin proponents such as Messari co-founder Dan McArdle believe BTC’s conservative features will bring it long-term value similar to that of gold.      For Austrian economists like Thornton, gold’s value comes down to economic theory first posited in ""Principles of Economics"" (1871) by Austrian school founder Carl Menger. To briefly summarize, Menger said everyone determines value subjectively while a society creates a price one can buy or sell on the open market.      Gold’s value is readily demonstrated by its continued use as a store of value, particularly during recessions or financial crises.      “The supply schedule for gold is relatively stable. The quantity of gold supplied is a response to the demand for gold and its price,” Thornton said.    A gold-based economy    But how would a gold-based economy differ from our current economy? A stable medium of exchange would force people to be more responsible with the money they have, Roy Sebag, co-founder of precious metal custodian Goldmoney, told CoinDesk in an email.      This responsibility would lead to two outcomes: A stable money supply would make it difficult to stack up large corporate debts, limiting the dangers of a 2008-style financial crisis. But it would also help distribute wealth across the economy more efficiently than current systems do, Sebag said.      First, Sebag said a fiat-based system that is known to inflate the currency to protect against business failings leads to companies taking out too much debt. (Think of commercial airlines buying back stock in heady times as opposed to investing in their services, what some might consider a moral hazard.) Sebag says his point can be readily seen on Capitol Hill today – where Congress is weighing a multitrillion-dollar stimulus package with protections for firms such as Boeing.      “Under a gold monetary standard, leveraging a balance sheet in any circumstance is a risky proposition,” Sebag said.      Instead, failures would be allowed to happen – but they would not become this colossal in the first place. “Failure happens often and resilience becomes the integral ingredient in defining prosperity,” Sebag said of what a gold-based system would look like.      See also: Bitcoin, Gold Spike as Fed Unveils Unlimited Coronavirus Stimulus Package      Second, if people were able to plan financially on long time horizons, then retirees would not be put in a precarious position every time the economy blows the top. Sebag goes as far as to claim the elderly would boost the economy during a recession as opposed to being crushed by it.      Indeed, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost over 30 percent since its peak in February 2019. Many people’s retirement plans are underwater.      A gold economy, Sebag said, would allow people to plan for the future with a key metric: the interest rate.      Historically, Sebag said the natural interest rate – meaning the cost of future money when not set by a government – sat around 5 percent. Compare this to the rate-by-decree coming out of the Federal Reserve and periodic percentage drops: It’s hard to plan for the future when you don’t know what your assets will be worth in six months.    Two extremes    A bitcoin economy is laughably far off from a mainstream perspective – even more so than a gold-based economy. Bitcoin’s market cap sits below $200 billion while the Dow hit as high as $8 trillion in December 2019. Gold’s current market cap is around $9 trillion.      Yet, a savings-based money like gold or bitcoin becomes more attractive as the Fed and Washington lawmakers push toward fiscal extremes.      “In a gold-based economy without interest rate manipulation, taxes and so forth, people would have much more savings and far less debt. But now, with the Fed and paper money inflation, we have very little savings and gargantuan debt,” Thornton said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | BTG,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/03/23/bitcoin-and-gold-evaluating-hard-cap-currencies-in-times-of-financial-crisis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/da869b6d20769064b581c36b54624fe52be0dfbb-1500x913.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431671,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4qbh,1584997550,House Stimulus Bills Envision 'Digital Dollar' to Ease Coronavirus Recession (Updated),"UPDATE (March 24, 14:20 UTC): A new version of the ""Take Responsibility for Workers and Families Act,"" shared late Monday, does not include the ""digital dollar"" section.      Proposed legislation meant to shore up the U.S. economy during the coronavirus pandemic includes a recommendation to create a digital dollar.      This virtual greenback would help individuals and families survive the shutdown of businesses and series of “shelter-in-place” orders which resulted in skyrocketing unemployment claims and a potential severe recession.      Under the draft bills shared last week, dubbed the “Take Responsibility for Workers and Families Act” and the “Financial Protections and Assistance for America’s Consumers, States, Businesses, and Vulnerable Populations Act,” the Federal Reserve – the nation's central bank – could use a “digital dollar” and digital wallets to send payments to “qualified individuals,” consisting of $1,000 for minors and $2,000 to legal adults.      Both bills employ identical language around the digital dollar suggestion.      “The term ‘digital dollar’ shall mean a balance expressed as a dollar value consisting of digital ledger entries that are recorded as liabilities in the accounts of any Federal Reserve bank; or an electronic unit of value, redeemable by an eligible financial institution (as determined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System),” the bills read.      The Fed would likewise be in charge of the digital wallets, maintaining them for recipients.      Neither bill indicates that the program would use a decentralized ledger or any sort of cryptocurrency project. However, digitizing the dollar in general is seen by many influential figures as a necessity for the U.S., with former Commodity Futures Trading Commission J. Christopher Giancarlo and economist Judy Shelton – who U.S. President Donald Trump has nominated to the Fed board – both claiming the nation may lose its financial hegemony if it fails to do so.      Fed member banks can also maintain something called a “pass-through digital dollar wallet,” according to the draft bills, and recipients would receive “a pro rata share of a pooled reserve balance” held by the member.      See also: The Overton Window Opens for a Digital Dollar      The bill follows Representative Rashida Tlaib's (D-Mich.) unveiling of the “Automatic BOOST to Communities Act,” which would provide any individual in the nation a pre-loaded debit card. The card would initially hold $2,000 and be given an additional $1,000 until one year after the COVID-19 pandemic is contained.      Under Tlaib’s bill, the U.S. Mint would issue two $1 trillion platinum coins, which the Fed would purchase using credit.      “The Treasury Secretary would ‘sweep’ the newly created reserve funds from the Mint’s account to the regular Treasury General Account,” the bill reads. These funds would then be disbursed to U.S. residents through the program.      “In the long term, the card infrastructure should be converted into a permanent, Treasury-administered digital public currency wallet system, to serve as a privacy-respecting ‘eCash’ complement to universal Fed Accounts and/or Postal Bank Accounts for All,” the bill reads.      See also: US Senate Floats ‘Digital Dollar’ Bill After House Scrubs Term From Coronavirus Relief Plan      The Democratic bills come as the Republican-led Senate remains in limbo over its own bill to stimulate the economy. Democrats have now blocked the Republican spending bill twice, arguing a $500 billion program grants the Treasury Department too much discretion and little transparency over how the funds would be disbursed to corporations.

Crypto asset performances to note on the day include bitcoin cash (BCH) up 13 percent, litecoin (LTC) in the green 7 percent and bitcoin SV (BSV) up 6 percent. The only asset down in the dumps on CoinDesk’s asset board today is Decred, down less than a percent.       The Fed's announcement of open-ended asset purchases plus $300 billion in emergency lending programs to stave off further economic downfall coincided with a boost in crypto and gold prices. The yellow metal is up 3 percent as of 20:30 UTC. However, the central bank's move wasn’t enough to stop the S&P 500’s continued downward slide. It was down 2 percent as of 20:30 UTC. The S&P 500 is at 2016 levels, erasing nearly four years of gains.      “It is increasingly likely that volatility and uncertainty associated with the coronavirus pandemic continue to increase in the near term across the global financial markets, as we have seen throughout March,” said Dan Zuller, partner at crypto research firm Vision Hill.      The U.S. is in the midst of an unprecedented economic halt, with no end in sight. The state of New York has been among those hit hardest, according to Centers for Disease Control data.      See also: Bitcoin: A Global Port in a Market Storm?      “As the Fed implements more programs to backstop the financial system, such as this morning's announcement of them buying corporate bonds and agency MBS [mortgage-backed securities], we will see the pressure ease on bitcoin and gold from the collateral selling/leverage unwind side,” said Siddhartha Jha, founder of Arbol, a blockchain-based weather insurance platform.       Cryptocurrency investors are keen to see what happens should possible endless money printing boost spending.      “The price to pay is inflation in the long run. Inflation expectations are popping and the long end of the treasuries (sic) curve is already pricing it in,” economist and trader Alex Kruger noted in a tweet.      It remains to be seen how government measures will affect inflation rates going forward, but it could make investors look towards alternative asset classes such as cryptocurrencies or gold. Yet, these assets still might not be what people want since a shock to the system can cause people to sell assets for cash to stuff in a mattress.      Jha, a former Wall Street analyst now focused on crypto with his startup Arbol, recalls the previous financial crisis vividly, and has a key insight of the days before crypto. “In 2008, as I was in the midst of the crisis at JPMorgan's interest rates desk, goId was expected to provide safety but collapsed around the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy,” he said.",POSITIVE,BCH | LTC,BCH | BUSINESS | FIAT | LTC | MARKET,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/23/investors-look-to-gold-crypto-after-fed-goes-on-qe-buying-spree,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2836fdf036815b18669f80760bce3081081ee394-1076x723.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

See also: In Fight Against Coronavirus, Governments Face Trade-Offs on Privacy      The reports caused alarm among privacy advocates who, while noting the need to address the public health crisis, worry about the companies that are being pulled in to help.      “During times of crisis, civil liberties are most at risk because the normal balance of safety versus privacy becomes tilted toward safety,” says Michele Gilman, a privacy lawyer and fellow at Data & Society, a think tank that studies the social impact of data-centric tech.      “A major concern is that new surveillance technologies deployed during the coronavirus crises will become the ‘new normal’ and permanently embedded in everyday life after the crisis passes. This can result in ongoing mass surveillance of the population without adequate transparency, accountability or fairness,” she said.      There is a precedent for this, and from not long ago. The 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 led to an expansion of surveillance cameras and networks across the U.S. and the Patriot Act, a federal law that removed legislative guardrails to government surveillance and decreased transparency, accelerating the National Security Agency’s intrusive and massive surveillance capabilities later revealed by whistleblower Edward Snowden. Despite the public backlash against the NSA’s practices, lawmakers have yet to de-authorize it.    “Ambiguous policies around what happens to the data collected after its intended use... rip away control and transparency for people.”    “Many of the directives implemented as part of the Patriot Act led to the abuses that were exposed by Snowden,” says Steven Waterhouse, the CEO and co-founder of Orchid Labs, a privacy focused VPN company. “What abuses will we learn about later, after this crisis has passed? What legislation will be rammed through the government during this time of crisis?”      Things that may now be considered mundane, such as an abundance of surveillance cameras, being subjected to full body screens at the airport and the idea that we are constantly being observed, weren’t always the case. Often, public crises provide opportunities for surveillance architecture to move forward and become normalized fixtures of society. and create commercial opportunities for tech companies to provide new and ever more intrusive ways of tracking individuals.      That’s the case with Clearview AI, a facial recognition startup that claims to have scraped billions of public images off the web and created software that can identify a face within seconds. It markets itself to law enforcement within the U.S. but also targeted authoritarian regimes around the world with records of human rights abuses as part of a rapid expansion plan, according to documents obtained by Buzzfeed News. The company has also overstated the effectiveness of its technology, claiming police departments solved cases after using it when that was not the case. The company now faces legal challenges from other companies, and state governments.      “Clearview has a pretty consistent pattern of not being forthcoming about information but also intentionally misleading their clients in my view,” says Clare Garvie, senior associate at the Georgetown University Law Center's Center on Privacy and Technology. “Whatever means the government implements or various state and local governments implement to combat the spread of this virus must be the least intrusive means possible. What Clearview AI is proposing is not the least intrusive means possible.”      Extensive research shows facial recognition is not equally accurate on everyone.      See also: Mass Surveillance Threatens Personal Privacy Amid Coronavirus      “Facial recognition is notoriously inaccurate for women and people of color,” says Gilman. “Given this, why would we adopt such technologies to battle coronavirus? Moreover, we need much more information on how these technologies are effective in battling a global pandemic.”      China has facial recognition systems that detect elevated temperature, while South Korea has tracked people using cell phone data and locations of financial transactions.      Palantir, meanwhile, has extensive contracts with law enforcement and has little to no transparency about its practices unless you’re a customer. In a rare user manual for law enforcement obtained by Vice in 2019, the program Palantir Gotham is said to be in use at law enforcement centers that target data sources including day care centers, email providers and traffic accidents for data that builds profiles of suspects, and their friends, family and business associates.      The company was co-founded by Peter Thiel, the liberatarian billionaire who was also an early investor in Facebook. Privacy advocates have reason to fear his motives. In a 2009 essay for the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank in Washington, D.C., Thiel wrote that “most importantly, I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.”    Public-Private    If privacy experts seem skeptical of companies like Clearview AI and Palantir, this is perhaps one reason why.      “Creating public-private partnerships to share sensitive data in times of crisis, such as a terrorism attack or a pandemic, brings short-term benefits but has an alarming impact on data privacy long after the emergency passes,” says Raullen Chai, CEO of IoTeX, a Silicon Valley company that develops privacy-protecting smart devices using blockchain.      “Ambiguous policies around what happens to the data collected after its intended use, as well as subjective triggers of ‘emergency-only’ practices, rip away control and transparency for people.”      Experts recognize the fundamental need to address immediate consequences of the coronavirus pandemic, but there is skepticism Clearview AI or Palantir would offer the required transparency and least intrusive approach.      Garvie worries about crisis profiteering. “It’s the use of fear to market surveillance tools,” says Garvie. “I just caution anyone considering contracting for these tools to make sure the decision is not being driven by the supplier, by the company, using the crisis to push through unnecessary surveillance mechanisms.”      Note: The description of Palantir's business has been updated.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/03/23/privacy-advocates-are-sounding-alarms-over-coronavirus-surveillance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/097365b354841bfc1b9d7e3cc98c8274eceb8673-1534x728.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431677,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4qjh,1584990900,Long-Festering DeFi Dapp Bug Still Not Fixed by Industry (Updated),"DeFi has an open security issue. A team of product designers for ZenGo, a noncustodial wallet company, found an exploit that can drain users’ funds from nearly all dapp wallets. While the security flaw has been known for two years, Ouriel Ohayon, CEO of ZenGo, is sounding the alarm, arguing the flaw poses a risk to users that has not been fully addressed.      The security issue, named BaDApprove, is not a code bug but a problem with how wallets interact with users and set transaction permissions by default.      Researching a number of high-profile wallets – including Metamask, Opera and imToken – Ohayon found that when users approve a specific transaction, they are also often approving all future transactions by default. This opens the doors for malicious decentralized applications to interact with user funds without their knowledge or consent, possibly pilfering entire ether (ETH) holdings.      See also: How Ethereum Applications Earn A+ Security Ratings      The bug is well documented, though Ohayon’s complaint rekindles a seminal conflict in crypto: Should crypto companies do what they can to protect users, or should crypto holders take full responsibility for their digital asset wealth?      The ZenGo team set up a dapp demonstration to alert users of this potential exploit. The video shows a user who sends a few FRTs (a testnet currency) to the “rogue swapping app” and permits it to withdraw said tokens and automate transactions. Then, the BaDApprove dapp drains the user’s entire balance.    Wallets should be showing this information front and center to users, and having alerts if it thinks something sketchy is going on.    “It’s like saying, ‘by doing this bank transfer you accept the recipient will receive full access to your bank account,’” Ohayon said over Telegram. The situation is aggravated by the fact that many wallets do not communicate to their users these permissions stand, even if users stop using the dapp.      Contacted by CoinDesk, Sunny Aggarwal, a research scientist at Tendermint and Cosmos, ran the simulation and also saw the consequences.      “Ethereum dapps, if they want to interact with your ERC20 tokens, first need to ask approval to be allowed to move up to some number of them,” Aggarwal said in a direct message. “What happened here is that the dapp asked to approve an extremely high amount of tokens, [without showing] how much is being approved.”      Aggarwal used the popular Metamask wallet, which he said only showed the transaction amount after he clicked ""Show More Details."" “And even then you'll see it displayed as 1.1579…………e+59,” or in scientific notation, “which is way too easy for someone to misread and accidentally think it's approving like ~1.15 tokens.”      “This is a failure on the part of the wallets,” he said. “Wallets should be showing this information front and center to users, and having alerts if it thinks something sketchy is going on.”    Known issue    What Ohayon and ZenGo have highlighted has been a known issue in the DeFi (decentralized finance) community for years. The larger question is why it hasn’t been fixed. To some in the dapp world, the answer is it isn’t so much a flaw or a bug as a non-good feature.      In September 2018, Jordan Randolph, a representative of Ethex, a decentralized exchange, outlined the problem in a Medium post. One-time approvals to move “a nearly infinite amount of tokens … can be convenient,” he wrote. “However, having a nearly infinite number of tokens approved means all of [your] token[s are] available to be transferred by the smart contract.”      The wallet preset comes down to a choice between convenience and security, he said. Randolph did not respond to a request for comment.      See also: OPINION: Thanks to Better UX, This Year Dapps Will Go Mainstream      “Dapps that only offer one option – the approval of a huge number of tokens – harbor a fatal security flaw.”      Over the past few weeks, ZenGo has raised the issue with a number of prominent wallets, often receiving pushback.      “This issue is a known risk and requires user interaction. We have already clearly notified the user when they are entering a third-party dapp. But we still thank you for your report,” an imToken representative told Tal Be'ery, ZenGo cofounder, over Twitter.      Reached by CoinDesk, Ben He, imToken CEO, said, “It's not a security exploit, it's a not-good convention to the whole Ethereum ecosystem that most of dapps/DeFi apps request unlimited allowance from users.”      To address the issue, the imToken dapp browser has two popup modals, he said. One is when a first-time user visits the dapp URL, and the second pops up asking for user consent before transacting.      “It's critical a user signs transactions cautiously and we see this is a proper and friendly reminder to the community,” he said, adding the company is “polishing our UI (user interface) to mitigate the concerns.”      Metamask presented a similar response when queried about unlimited permissions. “This is actually a secure feature that users regularly use responsibly. It is not some kind of bug or problem,” an individual from MetaMask's support line said.      “[T]here is not an inherent issue with the ERC-20 standard, but [it] is fundamental to allowing smart contracts to interoperate with tokens,” he said.      The firm has been proactive in adding safeguards, like popup messages that ask for confirmation to send funds and let users adjust the approved sum under advanced settings.      See also: The US Should Use Stablecoins for Emergency Coronavirus Payments      Additionally, according to the representative, Metamask has “plans to give the users even more control,” such as features making it easier to revoke this allowance.      Ohayon also cited Brave and Coinbase as displaying a “meaningful warning,” though this does not remove the risk that malicious actors can exploit dapp users.      “Some security compromises that might have been acceptable in the era when users were scarce and highly technical are not acceptable when DeFi goes mainstream, acquiring many non-technical users, and handling crypto tokens in the billions (USD),” Alex Manuskin, ZenGo researcher, wrote in a blog post.      He believes if crypto is ever to go mainstream, proper safeguards will have to be put in place to make sure new users are not exploited.      A similar issue was raised two weeks ago following the crypto flash, when the question of trading “circuit breakers” came up. For many, these precautions vie against the crypto ethos of decentralization and personal autonomy.      UPDATE: In response to ZenGo's research, imToken representative Philipp Seifert got in touch to say the firm will add push notifications for transactions and a way to edit allowances.

42431673,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4qfh,1584988750,Bitcoin: A Global Port in a Market Storm?,"Noelle Acheson is a veteran of company analysis and CoinDesk’s director of research. The opinions expressed in this article are the author’s own.      The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a weekly newsletter focused on institutional investment in crypto assets. Sign up for free here.      After the market storms of the past couple of weeks, we could all use some (relatively) good news. And it’s this: Storms bring destruction but also clarity.      As I write, bitcoin (BTC) is bouncing, but who knows what wild swings it will have gone through by the time this is published? So, bitcoin’s price is not where to look for clarity now. It’s more existential than that.      Out of the chaos of the last couple of weeks, in which everything moved together, a clearer distinction has emerged between asset classes.      Greater clarity itself may be good news, but what we’re seeing is not.      Let’s walk through the new fundamentals.    Come rain or shine    First, equities: Expected earnings are down across the board, possibly by a whopping amount. A couple of weeks ago, in the U.S. and Europe, business was humming along, albeit with trepidation. Now, bars and restaurants are closed in many population centers, events have been cancelled, shops are shut, planes are grounded…. The list of sectors impacted by the necessary virus precautions is long and alarming.      Next, government bonds: If there’s one thing the bond market hates, it’s inflation. The unwinding of globalization as a result of constricting supply chains will push up manufacturing costs which will feed through to prices. Liberally sprinkle money around the system in the hopes of stimulating spending, in a supply crisis, and you add to the inflationary pressure. Nominal yields on public debt are at historically low levels; inflation will push even more real yields into negative territory.    For those worried about inflation, bitcoin is even more resistant than gold.    As for corporate bonds, the sharp drop in earnings coupled with increasing costs could trigger a wave of defaults.      What about gold? The traditional safe haven will probably do well in the medium term as investors remember its anti-inflationary properties. Gold traditionally outperforms in low-rate environments – no shortage of those these days. Plus, its lack of income makes it less vulnerable to drops in economic activity.      And then there’s bitcoin. Its high volatility makes it unsuitable for many investors. But those who think gold makes sense in this world gone mad are most likely going to take a closer look, especially after the perspective-changing storm we’ve just weathered (with probably more to come). Even those skeptical of gold’s place in a diversified portfolio are bound to be curious about a digital alternative that solves for some of the metal’s weak points while revealing relationships with the broader economy that no other asset has.      Last week I wrote about how it’s not a safe haven. Here’s the thing: it doesn’t need to be.      See also: As This Crisis Worsens, Bitcoin Will Become a Safe Haven Again      For those worried about inflation, bitcoin is even more resistant than gold. Its hard cap and pre-programmed supply are immune to fluctuations in price. A sharp jump in the price of gold, however, is likely to bring more supply onto the market as production ramps up, and could even impact the estimated supply limit as alternative mining methods become profitable.      For those worried about a sharp economic slump, bitcoin is practically the only asset not directly impacted by macroeconomics. There’s no income to cut and no supply chains to hinder access. External factors such as energy costs and supply chains can impact miner economics, but bitcoin itself adjusts for shifts in the maintenance of its network. When miners close down, bitcoin becomes cheaper to mine, which eventually makes the enterprise profitable again.    Save it for a rainy day    What makes bitcoin even more of a unique asset class is it can be indirectly impacted by macroeconomics, in a big way. The impact will come from many vectors, but especially loose monetary policy, the currency markets, emerging economies and populist tendencies.      1) Loose monetary policy: With central banks around the world hitting the markets with whatever they can, money supply constraints have been thrown out the window. As this crisis unfolds, the amount of money that will enter the system to help out not only markets but also citizens and companies will dwarf what we saw in 2008. Back then, the markets were threatening to drive the economy into a wall, so reassuring them was paramount. Now the threat to the economy is driving markets into the wall. The usual tactics that assuage market panics aren’t going to stimulate demand that is reeling from mandated shutdowns, job losses and generalized fear.      Printing money could perhaps help if it actually gets into the hands of the consumers, but that will create inflationary pressure in an economy with no tools left to fight it. The usual anti-inflation weapon is raising interest rates – but doing that in a heavily indebted environment could trigger waves of corporate and even sovereign defaults.      Growing inflationary pressures and steady currency debasement will most likely increase interest in disinflationary assets such as bitcoin and gold that can also be used for payment in some circumstances.      2) Currency markets: Investors around the world are fleeing into dollars, pushing up its value relative to other currencies. This could help the U.S. consumer by making imports cheaper, if imports weren’t disrupted by supply chain constrictions. But with a stronger dollar, U.S. manufacturing will become uncompetitive, and foreign holders of dollar-denominated debt could get pushed into default. Other countries' import and debt service costs will skyrocket, weakening their currencies and pushing up the dollar even further.      The ballooning demand for dollars could lead to a currency liquidity crunch – the swap lines extended to foreign central banks in last Sunday’s Fed intervention were expanded even further on Thursday, a worrying sign that the initial measure wasn’t enough to relieve the strain on the FX markets.      See Also: Into the Unknown: No Limit on Fed Money Injections      Calls are growing for concerted action similar to the 1985 Plaza Accord, but getting economic powers to follow the lead of an “America First” government whose leader based much of his campaign on promises of a wall is going to be a much harder challenge than in the post-stagflation desperation of the late 20th century.  With fractures in the global currency order becoming increasingly apparent, economists and investors will be asking what the next monetary order will look like. Bitcoin may or may not be part of that solution but it is a new tool in the box.      3) Emerging economies: The sharp escalation of dollar-based prices, combined with a demand crunch, could push non-dollar economies into recession, which is likely to lead to social unrest. In some parts of the world, this could be met with swift retaliation or even regime change. The confiscatory bias of political parties navigating a power struggle could intensify interest in a liquid and semi-private store of value.      4) Populist tendencies: While more established democracies will deal with recessions and social unrest through negotiations and trade-offs, even they could veer towards populist tendencies. These will most likely take the form of additional support for overwrought health systems, as well as for citizens and companies hit hard by mandated shutdowns and resulting slump in demand.      To keep up the pretence of balanced budgets, this support is likely to be paid for through fiscal policy, which means tax increases. While bitcoin should never be used to avoid taxes (never, ok?), investors in some jurisdictions may feel that the risk of stiff penalties when caught is worth it.      But more importantly, fiscal measures are generally more lenient on capital gains than on high incomes, in the spirit of encouraging investment. This could push high-net-worth individuals towards assets with a high risk-return profile.    Chasing rainbows    In a market where everything goes up, the resulting dust can blur big-picture vision. After a drenching storm there is damage, but the dust is gone. Edges are sharper and colors are more vibrant. To stretch a metaphor even further, maybe the sun won’t be out for a while, but as we look anew at previously held assumptions, it is likely investors around the world will see in bitcoin attributes that until now have not been so important.      This is not investment advice, obviously, and all investors work under different risk-return parameters. It is a reminder that we should all question assumptions, get informed, ask different questions and think things through. And now is a better time to do that than ever before.

42431661,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4qJh,1584983580,Ruble's Drop Eases Pain of Lower Bitcoin Prices for Russia's Miners,"The global market meltdown has indirectly benefited Russia's bitcoin miners, even as the cryptocurrency's price tumbled along with other assets.      That's because the Russian national currency has rapidly lost value, dropping from 60 rubles to the dollar to 80 in two weeks. In addition to the coronavirus pandemic weighing on all markets, the ruble has also taken a hit from the price war started by Saudi Arabia, which slashed the price of oil, Russia’s main import, to its lowest level in three years.      With the ruble plunging, the average price in Russia for electricity, one of the biggest costs for miners, also dropped. In Siberia, Russia’s main region for mining, the average price for power available to local mining farms fell from 5 cents per megawatt per hour to 4.      At the same time, the price of bitcoin (BTC), while plunging itself, still is calculated in U.S. dollars, which makes the bear market a bit less painful for mining farms in Russia, several such outfits told CoinDesk.      In other words, with bitcoin trading around $6,200 Monday, if you sold bitcoin for rubles the price would be $6,200 times 80 rubles, not 60 rubles as it would have been two weeks ago. Thus, the hit to revenue is mitigated for miners that run their specialized computers from these farms.      “As the cryptocurrency price is bound to the U.S. dollar, the ruble’s fall is beneficial"" for miners, said Alexander Shashkov, the founder of Intelion Mining.      Igor Runets, CEO of the Bitriver mining facility in Bratsk, Russia, said he signed two new contracts with miners last week for a total of 24 megawatts per hour of electricity.      All expenses at the farm are in rubles, Runets says, so “with the ruble falling down, Russia is strengthening its position on the [mining] market.""  He’s also planning to leverage forward spread contracts for buying dollars at an agreed price in future, to hedge against the ruble possibly going up later. Bitriver is now in talks with one of the Russian banks about buying such contracts, Runets said.      “Dollar exchange rate does not affect the price of electricity. Salaries and other costs don’t rise that fast either,” said Zakhar Fedorov, the business development manager at Cryptoreactor, another mining farm in Bratsk. However, his farm hasn’t seen an inflow of new clients from abroad yet.      “We do have requests from the foreign miners, but no more than usual. Due to the bitcoin price crash and the hysteria around coronavirus, in such a situation many prefer to sit on cash,” Fedorov added.      Mining in Russia is mostly concentrated in Siberia, where low temperatures most of the year provide natural cooling and the electricity is cheaper than in other parts of the country due to the abundance of hydropower plants.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/23/rubles-drop-eases-pain-of-lower-bitcoin-prices-for-russias-miners,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f6c5e2d8e775007724f165c6855b1cad433f4436-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42431665,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4qRh,1584982865,"HODLpac Enlists Winklevoss Twins, Brian Armstrong in Bid to Influence Crypto Policy in Washington","A new political action committee (PAC) is hoping to push crypto-friendly public policy by providing financial support to Congressional candidates.      Founded by former Cato Institute staffer Tyler Whirty, HODLpac seeks to advocate for blockchain legislation by directing funds to different congressional candidates – but with a decentralized twist.      Donors may ultimately use Ethereum-based tokens to vote for which candidates should get their support, though initially voting will not tap any crypto tokens. The PAC will rely on We the Peeps, a fundraising platform built by Peeps Democracy, Whirty said.      According to Federal Election Commission filings, the PAC’s founding donors include a who’s who of crypto notables.      The documents list Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss of Gemini, Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong and Emilie Choi, Donald R. Wilson Jr of DRW, Polychain’s Olaf Carlson-Wee, Nathan McCauley of Anchorage and the Blockchain Association’s Kristin Smith.      Smith as well as Polychain President Joseph Eagan and Compound Finance lawyer Jake Chervinsky are listed as founding board members.      The PAC has raised $21,000 to date, according to federal filings, and about $4,600 has been spent on operating expenditures.      Right now, HODLpac doesn’t accept cryptocurrency donations, though Whirty said he expects to “in the near future.”    How it works    Essentially, if an individual donates to HODLpac, they receive an equivalent number of “votes.” However, the group will use quadratic voting in the actual implementation, meaning a donor can choose multiple recipients but each subsequent recipient receives a smaller share of that donor’s vote.      “This is a concept that's been used in the crypto space increasingly often,” Whirty said. “It's the idea that each traditional vote costs the square of that vote. So one vote costs one, two votes cost four, three costs nine and so on.”      HODLpac is using this type of voting mechanism partly because it allows donors to express “the degree of [their] preference"" rather than just simply a direction for their funds. It also helps ensure that individuals who donate larger amounts don’t have an outsize influence on where the donated funds go.      The PAC has been operational since January, Smith told CoinDesk, though it only went live Monday after securing its raft of founding donors.      “Getting the public policy right for crypto is critical to the success of the industry and the technology going forward,” she said. “For me, HODLpac is a new tool in the crypto policy making toolbox.”    Filling a void    Smith said a lot of groups already exist to help educate political leaders, including Coin Center and the Chamber of Digital Commerce as well her own organization, but to date there hasn’t been a sustained fundraising project.      The PAC hasn’t yet donated to any candidates, but Whirty said any donor whose contribution exceeded $250 would be able to nominate a potential recipient.      Example candidates who have championed crypto in Congress include Reps. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), Darren Soto (D-Fla.) and Warren Davidson (R-Ohio), he said.      HODLpac will also rank congressional representatives and candidates by how crypto-friendly their policies are, Whirty said.      “The initial community ballots will be seeded with some of those people but we do want this to be a kind of community-governed but also kind of curated effort,” Whirty said. “Those who are paying attention to crypto politics will be able to make suggestions and nominations.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/03/23/hodlpac-enlists-winklevoss-twins-brian-armstrong-in-bid-to-influence-crypto-policy-in-washington,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fd5cc8c1fbf614b4df9ed34f85e87362aebe82fa-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431666,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4qTh,1584982190,Into the Unknown: No Limit on Fed Money Injections,"The Federal Reserve pledged Monday to buy bonds in an unlimited quantity while allocating at least $300 billion to new emergency-lending programs. These measures are being taken as Wall Street reels from fresh predictions of a steep drop-off in economic output due to coronavirus-related lockdowns, business disruptions and job losses.       “The coronavirus pandemic is causing tremendous hardship across the United States and around the world,” the central bank said in a statement on its website. “Aggressive efforts must be taken across the public and private sectors to limit the losses to jobs and incomes and to promote a swift recovery once the disruptions abate.”      The expanded liquidity injections signaled the Fed’s willingness to go beyond even the already-dramatic steps taken in recent weeks to keep traditional Wall Street stock and bond markets from convulsing. In a previously unscheduled meeting on March 15, policymakers led by Chair Jerome Powell slashed short-term interest rates close to zero, just days after pledging to inject $1.5 trillion into the financial system via short-term loans to Wall Street dealers.       The latest announcement, made early in the U.S. day, came after overnight trading in Asian markets and futures contracts were indicating the S&P 500 Index was headed for another steep drop. Investor confidence was further eroded by U.S. lawmakers’ failure to reach agreement late Sunday over a proposed $1.8 trillion aid package.       Yet, even with the latest pledge of support from the Fed, the S&P 500 was down about 2.8 percent in early trading on Monday.       Bitcoin (BTC), viewed by some cryptocurrency investors as a hedge against the inflationary pressures from central bank money-printing, climbed 7.3 percent to a price of $6,272 as of 13:31 UTC (9:31 a.m. in New York). The move trimmed bitcoin’s year-to-date loss to 13 percent, less than half of the S&P 500’s 31 percent loss so far in 2020.     Using the 2008 playbook     With the new round of emergency-lending programs, the Fed has now undone nearly all of its efforts to “normalize” financing conditions following the unprecedented actions taken during the 2008 financial crisis. In that era, the Fed also cut rates close to zero and provided some $1.2 trillion of secret emergency financing to the world’s largest banks, on top of the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) bailout package approved by lawmakers.       In Monday’s statement, the Fed said new emergency-financing programs of up to $300 billion would support borrowing by employers, consumers and businesses. The Treasury Department will provide $30 billion of equity for the new programs, indicating taxpayers would take the first hit from any defaults before the central bank suffered any losses.      See also: Unlimited QE and Why Markets Can’t Price In COVID-19      The Fed also said it would start buying bonds backed by commercial mortgages as part of a previously announced pledge to purchase Treasury bonds and residential mortgage-backed securities.       Previously the central bank had allocated $700 billion to the asset purchases, but those purchases now will be made “in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning,” according to the statement.       And in keeping with Powell’s recent pledge to use emergency programs hatched during the 2008 financial crisis, the central bank rolled out a series of lending initiatives to support bonds backed by student loans, auto loans, credit card loans, small business loans and “certain other assets.”    New credit facilities    A new Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility, or PMCCF, will be set up to help finance new bond and loan issuances. A Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility will provide liquidity for outstanding corporate bonds.       “The PMCCF will allow companies access to credit so that they are better able to maintain business operations and capacity during the period of dislocations related to the pandemic,” the central bank said. The program will provide four-year loans, and borrowers may elect to defer interest and principal payments during the first six months, extendable at the Fed’s discretion.       A recently revived fund to support money-market mutual funds will now include bank certificates of deposit and a special type of instrument known as ""variable-rate demand notes"" used to provide financing to municipalities.       The Fed added that it would “soon” establish a Main Street Business Lending Program to support lending to small and medium-size businesses.       The Fed’s monetary-policy committee, consisting of presidential appointees and a selection of the top executives of the central bank’s regional branches, is set up as an independent government entity with so-called lender-of-last-resort powers. That means it has the wherewithal to provide freshly printed money to banks when other funding sources dry up.       The Fed committee typically meets in secret, with full transcripts of meetings released only years afterward. The structure gives the central bank leeway to act quickly to provide stimulus, though it also opens up policymakers to after-the-fact scrutiny and criticism — including suggestions large-scale money-printing might eventually stoke runaway inflation.       Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a separate statement he authorized the new Fed emergency-lending funds along with the expansion of the previously announced programs.       “This administration is working with the Federal Reserve and will continue to take aggressive action to address liquidity issues,” Mnuchin said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/23/into-the-unknown-no-limit-on-fed-money-injections,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0b7a2b027f3b713573a218548af04587fe3124e8-1500x993.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42431656,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4qDh,1584981750,Kik Backs Away From Jury Trial Request in SEC Fight Over $100M Token Sale,"The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Kik are pushing for a speedy resolution to their ongoing legal battle, with both claiming the other has provided insufficient evidence to support their case.      In a motion for summary judgment filed at the District Court for the Southern District of New York, the SEC claimed Kik had failed to provide any ""cognizable defense"" for why it had not registered its kin token sale – which raised a total of $100 million in 2017 – with the regulator.      The SEC claims Kik sold tokens to investors on the understanding they would see a return – a key legal characteristic of a securities offering – through expanding utility in a growing token ecosystem. In the filing, the regulator cites instances where CEO Ted Livingston suggested the kin price would likely increase in value.      The regulator also refutes Kik's claims that half its sale was exclusively for accredited investors, arguing that little effort was made to distinguish it from its public sale, with no restrictions on accredited investors selling newly-acquired kin tokens on the open market.      ""This is a straightforward case in which Kik’s investment scheme and violation of Section 5 are easily identified,"" reads the SEC's filing. Although the Ontario-based company claims it does not come under the SEC's jurisdiction, the regulator says it made itself liable by selling to U.S. citizens.      Established in 2009, the firm intended kin tokens to work as part of a token economy integrated into its messaging app. The company claimed it hadn't hosted an unregistered securities sale since the SEC first took action in early 2018. Relations between the two sides have deteriorated, with Kik claiming the SEC ""twisted facts"" about its token sale in 2019.      In its motion for summary judgment, Kik argues that, contrary to the SEC's allegations, it followed U.S. securities legislation to the letter. The firm says it hosted two sales: a pre-sale round for accredited investors to raise funds for developing the Kin ecosystem, and a second public sale to distribute tokens to users.      Kik claims to have filed a Form D notice for the pre-sale in September 2017, exempting it from registering the offering with the SEC. The company also argues its second sale, open to the public, was not a securities offering because Kik did not promise returns on investment or offer contractual obligations to investors.      See also: Kik Sells Messaging App, Reaffirms Kin Crypto Integration      Kin tokens were also intended to become a new form of currency that, by law, are explicitly not classified as securities. This, Kik says, is in line with what other U.S. regulatory bodies, including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS), have ruled in classifying cryptocurrencies as commodities.      By disregarding key aspects of the sale and the nature of the token, Kik says the SEC is stepping outside of its remit: ""The SEC asks this Court to bless an unprecedented and dramatic expansion of the SEC’s regulatory authority.""      As recently as January of this year, Kik had again been pushing for a jury trial to make its case that its initial coin offering was not, in fact, unlawful. Last summer, Livingston said the SEC complaint “presents a highly selective and grossly misleading picture of the facts and circumstances surrounding our 2017 pre-sale and token distribution event. We look forward to presenting the full story in court.”      Summary judgments are usually granted in cases where a judge deems the outcome to be a foregone conclusion and therefore not worth taking to full trial. However, it is common practice for defendants to file motions for summary judgments, even if the chance of success is relatively slim.      Both parties filed their motions for summary judgment last Friday.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | COMMODITY | REGULATION | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/03/23/kik-backs-away-from-jury-trial-request-in-sec-fight-over-100m-token-sale,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f3a0ff6795414960aa37af719c97b0d060d18d8e-2039x1530.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The latest to have apparently fallen at that hurdle is a group of Steem community members who recently opted to form a new blockchain over fears that Tron founder Justin Tron would seek to exert too much control of Steem's ecosystem.      The group, Hive.io, dubbed the new blockchain Hive, and it materialized via a hard fork of Steem last week. The plan is to reproduce all steem tokens with new hive tokens on a one-for-one basis. Sun's big pile of steems would not be copied over, leaving him with no power in the new chain's governance.      However, in choosing the Hive moniker, the project has stepped on the corporate toes of a blockchain firm branded with the same name.      HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd., a Canadian publicly listed mining firm based in Vancouver, published a notice Monday saying it has sent a cease-and-desist letter from its legal representatives to Hive.io, saying the new blockchain is tapping into its investment in building ""goodwill"" in the industry.      ""In response to multiple shareholder inquiries understandably confused by this Blockchain’s announcement, HIVE clarifies that it has no association with this Blockchain,"" the mining firm writes. ""HIVE believes this Blockchain’s use of 'Hive' and 'Hive Blockchain' is, intentionally or otherwise, confusing with the Company’s brand, which it has used globally over the Internet in relation to its connection with blockchain related goods and services including cryptocurrency.""

42431675,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4qhh,1584970859,"Bitcoin, Gold Spike as Fed Unveils Unlimited Coronavirus Stimulus Package","Bitcoin's (BTC) price shot up along with gold and stock futures after the U.S. Federal Reserve announced a quantitative easing package with no upper limit to support the economy amid the coronavirus crisis.      Immediately after the 12:00 UTC announcement, bitcoin jumped from $5,860 to $6,628 in an hour, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index. Gold, a classic safe-haven asset, rose from $1,494 to $1,524 over the same time frame.      The Fed's announcment indicates it is taking stronger actions, including open-ended asset purchases, to support the flow of credit to households and businesses.      ""The Federal Reserve will continue to purchase Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning and effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions,"" the central bank said.      Essentially, the Fed now stands ready to expand its bond purchases as required. The central bank's balance sheet hit a record $4.7 trillion last week.      Read more: Into the Unknown: No Limit on Fed Money Injections      With the Fed going all-in to support the economy, sentiment on Wall Street turned positive alongside the uptick in bitcoin and gold. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which were down nearly 900 points during the European hours, are now reporting a 400-point gain.      The foreign exchange market reacted to the Fed's new QE effort by offering the greenback. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against majors, fell from 102.80 to 101.70 following the central bank's announcement.      Bitcoin's move higher along with gold is likely to revive the safe-haven narrative but it will be interesting to see if the positive correlation persists.      Both gold and bitcoin have fallen sharply over the last two weeks, reviving memories of the 2008 crash when the yellow metal had declined by 30 percent from $1,030 to $680 from March to October before decoupling in November. Gold went on to hit record highs above $1,900 per ounce in September 2011.      ""History doesn't repeat itself but given the deluge of fiscal and monetary stimulus, incoming bitcoin bulls are hoping that it will rhyme,"" said crypto derivate research firm Skew Market in its daily update.

42383452,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vxkB,1584969327,SEC Charges Former State Senator Over Digital Asset 'Scam',"The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has pressed charges against a former state senator for his role in a $4.3 million token sale that promised outlandishly high returns.      The SEC confirmed Friday it had filed a complaint against David Schmidt, a former Republican state senator for Washington State, as well as two other people for their role promoting the sale of ""Meta 1 Coins.""      Filed in the Western District of Texas on March 16, the complaint accuses Robert Dunlap and Nicole Bowdler, as well as Schmidt, of violating antifraud and securities regulations when promising investors returns of nearly 225,000 percent. They also claimed the coin was risk-free and would never lose value.      The SEC said defendants made ""numerous false and misleading statements,"" including that Meta 1 Coin was backed by an art collection valued at $1 billion, or a gold deposit valued at $2 billion, that was regularly audited by an accounting firm.      ""The defendants made audacious claims about the Meta 1 Coin and would say almost anything to separate investors from their money,"" said David Peavler, the SEC's regional director at the Fort Worth Regional Office. “Investors should always look skeptically at promoters who claim that their investment cannot lose value or that investors will receive massive returns.”      See also: US Court Fines ICOBox $16M for Securities Violation in SEC Case      In total, Meta 1 Coin raised $4.3 million from around 150 investors, some based in the U.S. The digital assets were never distributed to investors, however. Some of the proceeds were funneled to a Chicago-based fund, Pramana Capital, as well as to another individual, Peter Shamoun. The SEC claims defendants used investors' money to fund lavish lifestyles, including the purchase of a $215,000 Ferrari.      Launched in 2018, Meta 1 Coin's website doesn't include a description of what the purpose of the coin is. Its Twitter page is filled with pictures and short clips of physical Meta 1 Coins, talking about the disruptive potential of blockchain technology.      Its terms of use also include some pretty weird statements, including:    ""The only participants of META 1 Coin Trust and the named websites are for Live Natural Man and Women, flesh-and-blood Almighty God-created private Humans sui juris sentient being; and an Ambassador of God Almighty Domiciled in the ARIZONA Republic and on religious sojourn through the UNITED STATES.""    See also: Steven Seagal Settles Token-Touting Charges With SEC Over 2018 ICO      Schmidt, a moderate Republican, was initially elected as a representative for Washington State back in 1994. After serving four terms, he became a state senator in 2002, before losing his re-election bid in 2006. Now based in Arizona, he works as a consultant, writer and radio program host, according to his LinkedIn page.      In 2012, Washington's electoral watchdog, the Public Disclosure Commission (PDC), fined Schmidt $10,000 for improperly using more than $41,000 in donations to reimburse himself for lost wages between 2003-2006, as well as mortgage repayments and personal travel costs.      Schmidt denied misusing campaign dollars, claiming in 2011 that campaign funding rules were ""very open to interpretation.""      Schmidt could not be reached for comment on the SEC complaint.      See also: SEC Proposal Could (Eventually) Unleash Security Token Sales      The SEC is seeking civil penalties and permanent injunctions against Schmidt and the other two defendants, as well as for investors to be refunded.

42383470,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vy5Z,1584963684,Bearish 'Death Cross' Price Patterns Loom for Both Bitcoin and US Stocks,"Both bitcoin and the U.S. stock markets are staring at a ""death cross"" – a widely tracked, bearish chart indicator – having suffered sharp losses over the last five weeks.      For bitcoin (BTC), the pattern is arising as the 50-day moving average (MA) moves to cross below the 200-day MA, likely in the next day or two. If confirmed, it would be the first death cross since Oct. 26, 2019, according to Bitstamp data.      Meanwhile, similar crosses are forming on Wall Street equity indices, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and the S&P 500.      The death cross is a long-term bear market signal, according to technical analysis theory. Despite the scary name, it's based on backward-looking moving average data and is the product of a recent notable price drop.      For example, the impending bitcoin death cross is preceded by the decline from $10,500 to $4,000 in the four weeks to March 13. The massive sell-off has caused the 50-day average to turn lower and drop to the 200-day average.    Bitcoin and Dow Jones crosses    Similarly, the Dow has tanked by more than 35 percent over the last five weeks and is likely to witness its death cross on Monday.      It should be noted that, as a lagging indicator, the death cross often traps sellers on the wrong side of the market, as seen on the historical bitcoin chart below.      As the averages closed in on the death cross on Oct. 25, 2019, the cryptocurrency picked up a strong bid and rose from $6,500 to $10,350 in less than 48 hours.      Another such cross, confirmed at the end of March 2018, was followed by a rise from $6,500 to $9,950.      That said, with the global markets still in panic mode courtesy of the coronavirus outbreak, the latest death cross may not turn out to be a contrary indicator. Amid fears of a recession, investors are treating bitcoin as a source of liquidity rather than a safe haven, as had been anticipated by many.      ""Another turbulent week can be expected for Asia markets as more countries lock down in the fight against COVID-19. The West is not looking too great either,"" Toby Wu, senior analyst at investment platform eToro, told CoinDesk.      Futures on the S&P 500 fell by 5 percent early Monday, triggering a limit down, while stocks in Asia cratered after the U.S. Senate failed to advance its coronavirus rescue package, bolstering recession fears. At press time, S&P 500 futures are down 3 percent and major European indices are flashing red.      As a result, bitcoin is likely to remain on the defensive. The top cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading at $5,840, representing a 6.57 percent drop on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.    Daily and 12-hour charts    Bitcoin is trading within the range of the big doji candle created on March 20 for the fourth straight day, a sign of indecision in the market place.      Acceptance under the candle low of $5,670 would imply an end to the corrective bounce from recent lows under $4,000 and shift risk in favor of a drop to $5,000.      That looks likely, as the 12-hour chart shows the cryptocurrency has dived out of an ascending channel.

42383467,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vy33,1584957600,The US Needs a Wartime Effort to Win the Coronavirus Battle,"Teddy Fusaro is the chief operating officer at Bitwise Asset Management, a cryptocurrency asset management firm in San Francisco. He has held management and leadership positions at alternative asset management companies for the past decade, and began his career at Goldman Sachs.      As America battles the invisible enemy of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), an exponentially growing silent killer, we find ourselves in a situation that is unprecedented in scale, in danger to our fellow citizens, and in the economic destruction and financial shock it is already causing.      To battle this invisible enemy we need to understand that we are facing three distinct threats. All three require different policy tools and coordinated actions, and those actions must be taken at ""wartime scale."" Each of the three require an unparalleled, full-scale, American war effort; without that effort, we will not win and will not emerge as the world’s superpower that we are today.      I believe America is equal to the task, and that this can prove to be our finest hour. But we must change now and do more, faster.      Also: How to Escape Contracts That Are Killing Your Company During Coronavirus      The three different threats – the three-headed monster we are battling – are intertwined and entangled, much as our modern world is.    Three crises    First, and most dire, is the public health crisis, which will infect and kill increasing numbers of Americans and overwhelm our hospital systems and medical care professionals, our heroes on the frontlines of this battle. It will be particularly deadly for our older and already-ill friends, neighbors and family. We have data from China (though questionable), South Korea, Italy, Iran, Europe and now the U.S. that gives a clear sense of what we are facing, and it can’t be ignored. In this war, our doctors, nurses and health care clinicians should be thought of as our soldiers marching to the front. We must do all that we can to arm them and protect them.      The second is an economic crisis, the severity and speed of which we have never seen, not even in the Great Depression during the 1930s. Goldman Sachs estimated that more than two million Americans would file for unemployment benefits last week. During the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, the highest weekly level was less than a quarter of that figure. Prior recessions have been slowdowns in economic activity relatively speaking. This is not that – it is a sudden halt. And it must be offset by an equal and opposite force.    The financial crisis must be stemmed so we have the circulatory system to fight the first two.    The third emergency is a financial crisis that has permeated the financial system as markets respond to the disruptions caused by the first two, with asset values declining rapidly and liquidity becoming discontinuous and disjointed in key arteries that allow for modern commerce. The financial crisis must be stemmed so we have the circulatory system to fight the first two.      Much as America failed to win the first battle of this war – through its inability to properly test for the virus at scale in the way that South Korea did – we are now running the risk of compounding our errors through the inability to diagnose the magnitude of each issue.      On the first issue, America simply does not have the option to back away from the quarantines, isolations and social distancing measures that have been rolled out over the past ten days. The only way to slow the spread of the virus and to protect those who will otherwise die from sickness is to reduce the number of those who become infected, and the only way we can do that is through quarantine, isolation and social distancing.      See also: The US Should Use Stablecoins for Emergency Coronavirus Payments      Otherwise, as we have seen in Italy and in Iran, the health care system will simply be overrun, like a cup held beneath a running faucet (some amount of this will happen in America already given our slow start, but we must do what we can to limit the loss of life). This not only kills more people – at a scale not seen since the Pandemic Flu of 1918. It also endangers our heroes, the doctors, nurses and medical professionals who will try to save as many lives as they can.    Green zones and red zones    America must close the borders of highly contagious clusters (New York, Washington state and likely others) to prevent those “red zones” (areas with high levels of infection) from exporting the virus to relatively healthy parts of the nation (“green zones”). Green zones (areas with relatively low community spread) can re-engage in economic activity substantially sooner than red zones, but if we continue to allow travel between regions, we won’t have any green zones to protect and no economic activity to turn back on. This is the technique that worked in Wuhan, China, where the virus is believed to have originated in the waning months of 2019.      We must aggressively and immediately – at never-before-seen scale – pour resources into testing, medical supply and equipment production, and the pursuit of the cure. Silicon Valley and corporate America are working on treatments and are champing at the bit to do more, faster. The Trump Administration should appoint a rapid-response tsar now to oversee engagement with our private sector and coordinate this part of the response.    The $6 trillion must be funded by expanding the federal deficit to levels not before considered acceptable.    Now is the time to immediately suspend regulation (“red tape”), and allow researchers and business to test solutions like never before. The government should directly fund new companies by taking equity stakes in startups that are building companies to solve these problems. The government can take these positions in startups by establishing a Sovereign Wealth Fund that can serve multiple other purposes as we defeat this three-headed-beast (more on that later).      Without testing we will not see our invisible enemy; without producing new medical equipment and supplies, we will not protect those on the front lines who need our support the most; and without a cure, we will not emerge on the other side. This is the time to invest in all at massive scale.    Economic medicine    The second issue, our severe economic crisis, is born from the first: the quarantines and shutdowns required to limit the spread of the disease are creating “economic sudden stops” the likes of which we have never seen. Economic activity has ground to a halt and will remain halted until we can increase testing to identify the sickness and find the “green zones” where activity can commence. Until then, economic life has ceased to exist.      As an example, consider the local neighborhood bar. The bar is closed, which means the bartender will no longer make her weekly wage. She needs money to eat and to pay rent and to buy basic medical treatments. Meanwhile, the bar owner has no income, so cannot pay rent to the landlord. The landlord may own multiple buildings but all those buildings are now closed, so cannot pay her mortgage.      Because the landlord cannot pay the mortgage, the lender will not get paid and must write down the value of the loan. The lender is interconnected to the rest of the system, which creates contagion in the financial markets. This is happening across America, in different forms, at an incredible rate, and we must respond at each level to support the individuals first and then the connected and related businesses, so they can survive and there is a job for the bartender to return to when we get through.      Here, America must fight the economic battle with all of the tools at its disposal, and those tools will come through fiscal policy designed by the White House and Treasury and passed legislatively through Congress. It must be the largest fiscal package we have ever seen. An economy worth roughly $23 trillion that is stopped for a quarter has approximately $6 trillion of activity that needs to be replaced.      Because of the unique features of this economic crisis, we must respond with unique tools. We cannot use the same tools we have used in the past, and we cannot underestimate the size of the looming disaster.      The $6 trillion must be funded by expanding the federal deficit to levels not before considered acceptable, or merely instructed the Treasury to mint new money under its existing legal authority. If Americans do not have cash, bread lines will form and social unrest will ensue.      See also: How Bitcoiners Can Protect Their Mental Health During the Coronavirus Crisis      We must first take care of those in our society who need help the most. In our example above, it isn’t just the bartender who needs money, fast, it’s the servers, the dishwashers, restaurant cleaners and all the others who keep the establishment running. All of them need money fast. We must get it to them and then ensure the landlord can pay the mortgage so the lender doesn’t fail.      Depending on our ability to pull out of the economic cycle, which may descend to Depression level depths if we do not act fast, we may need large-scale public works programs like President Franklin Roosevelt’s in the 1930s, which built much of our aging infrastructure that still exists today.    Financial containment    The third crisis that must be contained is the financial crisis. The Federal Reserve thus far is the American institution that has responded most exigently during this crisis. We should be proud of the actions the Fed has taken, but we should also understand it will need to do more. The American financial system, built around the dollar, is the circulatory system of not just one country but the world. If our system stops other economic activity will cease, and financial contagion will bleed over into the real economy, compounding the economic crisis and impairing our ability to resolve crisis one and two.      The financial system needs to survive so we can make it through this war, and so economic activity can commence in earnest once we get through to the other side. Financial failure must be held at bay, and the Fed has acted heroically over the past two weeks to stave off disaster. And despite what some think, it still does have more tools at its disposal. And eventually it will need to use them.      See also: DAOs, Hive, Hardware, DIY Sanitizer, VR, Personal Broadcasting: How Crypto Is Helping During the Coronavirus Crisis (Updated)      That includes open-ended quantitative easing of all asset types, outright purchases of municipal debt and negative interest rate policy. Those who are skeptical of this need look no further than the measures taken in the past decade by Japan’s central bank . The Fed must lend to the entire world to keep the existing global financial system alive. It has already done so by slashing rates, establishing commercial paper support facilities, increasing its repurchase programs, opening swap lines to foreign central banks and re-establishing quantitative easing. But it cannot act alone forever.      Unlike the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, when American banks were part of the problem, during this crisis American banks are part of the solution. They are well capitalized, well managed and ready for war. We must lean on them to get more money into our ailing corporations and continue to keep the system working. Easing Wall Street’s capital requirements, so institutions can lend more and take more risk is part of the solution. But we must also use them to get money from the Fed circulating in the system and to help establish equity stakes in firms that should be kept solvent until the storm is done. And the Fed must keep them liquid as they help to pull us through.    We cannot allow any large companies to fail, because the system in its fragile state cannot handle such additional shocks.    We’ll also need financial solutions for our ailing corporations. That will inevitably raise questions of moral hazard, who is held accountable for balance sheet management, compensation programs, stock buybacks and how taxpayers are made whole eventually. Those questions are important and should be answered, and they should be answered in ways that are more satisfying than they were after the Great Financial Crisis. But we cannot allow any large companies to fail, because the system in its fragile state cannot handle such additional shocks. Unlike the last crisis, this one was not caused by fraud, theft or mismanagement directly. It was caused by a novel pathogen that arrived in the world four months ago.      Establishing a U.S. sovereign wealth fund to buy assets and take stakes in companies that need immediate aid (particularly struggling airline, hotel, and travel companies – but this list will expand fast) could be part of the solution. It can buy assets others will not and create a financial juggernaut that can return massive financial gains to Americans over time. This will increase American financial strength when we exit the crisis, and is a sensible way for the government to take ownership stakes in public and private companies.    American ingenuity    Each of these proposals is obviously and clearly incomplete. But what is important is we understand the severity of the situation, the intertwined nature of all three problems and emphasize speed, size and a ""bias towards action"" to stem the crises before us.      The U.S. president should draft experts from the private sector into government service to administer these programs. Our best and brightest will happily serve but he would have the authority to effectively force participation through the Defense Production Act.      While America was slow to respond to the crisis we are now at risk of compounding that error, and the situation in each instance will get worse before it gets better even if we do act as fast as we can.      See also: Thousands of These Computers Were Mining Cryptocurrency. Now They’re Working on Coronavirus Research      But American ingenuity and strength can and must rise to the occasion. During World War II, life changed dramatically and in many ways as Americans at home supported the “war effort” – volunteering, participating in government-managed food and product rationing, submitting to price controls, entering public service to help in a variety of ways, and generally leaning into a national spirit of agreement, pride and will to win.      America still retains that winning spirit, and must channel it now to defeat this enemy. Instead of wallowing in defeat from loss in the first battle or fear that we may not emerge, we must make this our finest hour. As Roosevelt said in his inaugural address in 1933, “This great nation will endure as it has endured, will revive and will prosper. So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself – nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.”",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Teddy Fusaro,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/03/23/the-us-needs-a-wartime-effort-to-win-the-coronavirus-battle,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dd67ba58d19fcee197c071aeb75a94f001d5afad-1480x869.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383461,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vxrj,1584954000,Tezos Foundation Offloaded Millions of Dollars Worth of Bitcoin in 2019: Report,"The non-profit that holds funds raised in Tezos' $400 million initial coin offering (ICO) sold as many as 8,000 bitcoins (BTC) in 2019.      The share of the Tezos Foundation's portfolio made up of bitcoin fell from 61 percent in July to 47 percent as of the end of January, the non-profit disclosed in its biannual report, released Thursday. The value was reinvested into XTZ tokens and into other asset classes.      Per the report, the Tezos Foundation, which is based in Switzerland, held approximately $397.7 million worth of bitcoin on July 31, 2019. As bitcoin traded at the $10,000 mark, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index, the foundation held roughly 39,700 bitcoins.      As of Jan. 31, the foundation held 31,800 bitcoin, worth roughly $298.5 million based on a spot price of $9,400. That means the foundation sold as many as 8,000 bitcoins, which, even with the recent downturn in prices, would still be worth as much as $53 million today.      See also: Vertalo to Tokenize 22 Securities Worth $200M on Tezos Blockchain      The total value of the foundation's portfolio fell from $652 million on July 31 to $625 million by Jan. 31. It is managed by an asset-management strategy that is established and reviewed by the Tezos Foundation Council – the group that leads the organization – on a regular basis, according to the report.      Value was reinvested into other asset classes, including bonds, equities and fiat currencies.      The foundation also increased its tezos (XTZ) token exposure, upping the share from 15 percent to 23 percent. With the XTZ price increasing by nearly 40 percent in the six months between the reports, according to CoinGecko, the value of holdings went up by approximately $48.2 million.      Roman Schnider, CFO of the Tezos Foundation, told CoinDesk that although it considered bitcoin to be a ""key store of value,"" its asset strategy policy was to focus and pay for its long-term objectives ""without being distracted by short-term market moves.""      Investments into a stability fund – a diversified range of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and bonds – as well as fiat currencies, acted as risk management instruments that ensured ""operational effectiveness"" against crypto volatility, Schnider added.      Also read: Why Harvard Research on a Low-Profit Tezos Attack Matters for Proof-of-Stake      In Thursday's report, the Tezos Foundation said it had no plans to liquidate any of the XTZ allocated from the genesis block or generated from its own baking activities, a form of staking used to produce blocks and secure the tezos protocol.

42383459,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vxqT,1584942775,Why Polynomial Commitments Might Be a 'Breakthrough' for Ethereum 2.0,"The Ethereum community now has a roadmap, albeit a confusing one.      Dropped Wednesday, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin’s state of the network map helps contextualize the next five to 10 years for a global community of 20,000 developers while highlighting a key issue for the blockchain’s next version: scalability.      The Eth 2.0 research team is now leaning into a new concept called “polynomial commitments” to reduce the data used per computation on the network, according to a March 17 blog post by researcher Danny Ryan.      Dubbed “magic math” by Buterin, polynomial commitments are being eyed as a way to verify the state of the network at low computational cost, a key goal of the future network.      Still, Buterin’s map tags his magic math for network integration not until at least the third phase in the multi-year push to Eth 2.0.      “Polynomial commitments could be the major breakthrough we’ve been looking for,” Ryan said, specifically regarding the storage of account data in the next version of Ethereum.      The Ethereum Foundation did not respond to a request for comment by press time.    Magic math    Polynomial commitments are similar to the polynomials we all came to learn and love in elementary school: a math expression with both variables and coefficients (i.e., Y=2X).      But, again, this is magic math so it’s not quite so simple.      Buterin describes polynomial commitments as “a sort of ‘hash’ of some polynomial P(x) with the property that you can perform arithmetic checks on hashes.” The original paper on polynomial commitments, meanwhile, synthesizes the math scheme as “six algorithms” that show proof of an event occurring with as little computing data as possible.      “We suggest replacing Merkle trees by magic math called “polynomial commitments” to accumulate blockchain state,” Buterin said in the Ethereum Foundation blog post. “Benefits include reducing the size of stateless client witnesses (excluding contract code and state data) to near zero.”      (For the mathematically inclined, a three-part series on polynomial commitments hosted by Eth 2.0’s Justin Drake can be found below.)    The blockchain state    Blockchains record both the ins and outs users create when transacting. On the whole, blockchain accounting systems come in two kinds: the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model and the account-based model. Bitcoin uses the former while Ethereum uses the latter.      When a user wishes to spend bitcoin in the UTXO model, the transaction drags along with it the entire history of those coins, which is then checked by every peer on the network.      The account model, on the other hand, records only the transaction between the two peers while directing questions of the transaction's validity to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) in conjunction with a proof of the transaction. The EVM executes state changes – the current accounts and balances of the blockchain – on behalf of users.      Each block on Ethereum – which binds transactions into just that, a block – also contains a proof, a Merkle tree, which connects itself to the beginning of the network’s history. This proof contains the receipt of the state referenced above and is needed for the EVM to execute a transaction.      This last part has been a sticky issue for Ethereum, however.      Why? Merkle trees are data-efficient, yet not data-efficient enough for Eth 2.0’s ambitions. This is where the magic happens.      The current Merkle tree setup takes about 0.5 MB per transaction. Ryan estimates polynomial commitment schemes would reduce the weight of state proofs to between 0.001 and 0.01 MB. For a network that recently averages around 700,000 transactions per day, the savings in terms of data computation add up.      As such the idea of a stateless client has been in the works since at least October 2017 to reduce the amount of data used for ethereum’s big upgrade.      Multiple projects outside of Ethereum also lean on polynomial commitments in their own way, including Zcash’s zero-knowledge proof, Halo.      Buterin said his implementation of polynomial commitments remains one of many. Moreover, it’s still in the research phase.      “Although incredibly promising, some of this research and magic math is very new. We need to spend more time better understanding the complexities and tradeoffs, as well as just getting more eyes on this new and exciting technique,” Ryan concluded.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | ZEC | RESEARCH,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/03/23/why-polynomial-commitments-might-be-a-breakthrough-for-ethereum-20,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bfda30775d1514d278f2c08439c58452bce6ddfe-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383468,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vy1n,1584921905,Australian Share Market Reveals Potential Storm for US Equities While Bitcoin Falls,"The Australian share market fell sharply during its opening session of trading on Monday (AEST) after the country's Prime Minister announced drastic measures to curb the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).      Reeling from its worst week since the global financial crisis in 2008-2009, the benchmark S&P/ASX200 has fallen from Friday's close of 4,816 basis points to around 4,536, after Prime Minister Scott Morrison declared historic measures to curb the rise of COVID-19 from within the country.      On Sunday, March 22, Morrison ordered all pubs, clubs, churches and indoor sporting venues must close until further notice, while essential services such as grocery stores, gas stations and banks were to remain open. Australian schools will remain open for now. As of Sunday morning, the government reported 1,098 confirmed cases and seven deaths.      The new measures aim to limit the spread of the deadly virus that has sent developed economies into free fall in recent weeks, with the ASX responding with a 8.2 percent drop during the early Asian trading hours, revealing what could be in store this week for U.S. equities when they open Monday.      The chief investment officer at Orthogonal Trading, Joshua Green, said the downward pressure currently being experienced in the Aussie share market was the result of much of the same seen over last week's trade.      ""I think the ASX is being driven by global equities, which are being driven by a combination of momentum selling, panic selling and de-levering on the back of coronavirus fears,"" Green said.      ""The market clearly wants some sort of fiscal deal in the US which appears to be a struggle due to partisanship,"" he added.      Meanwhile in crypto, bitcoin (BTC) has fallen 5 percent on the day, from $6,200 to $5,894 with the rest of the market suffering a similar fate, signaling the potential for further bloodletting when U.S. equities markets open their doors for trading in the next 16 hours or so.      The total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies has fallen $10 billion over a 24-hour period, while major names such as ether (ETH), XRP and bitcoin cash (BCH) are down between 5 percent to 7 percent, respectively.",NEGATIVE,BCH | ETH | XRP,BCH | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/23/australian-share-market-reveals-potential-storm-for-us-equities-while-bitcoin-falls,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f5f1e7dc958d245aaaccd98332f35968e6fb16a9-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
