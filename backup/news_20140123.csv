42425345,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwBFh,1390519716,Pinterest Competitor Fancy Adds Bitcoin Payments,"New York-based social e-commerce platform Fancy, a website known as the ""Pinterest for shopping,"" is now accepting bitcoin.    The news was revealed in a 23rd January email from Fancy to its customers, which provided a basic introduction to bitcoin as well as simple directions on how bitcoin users can make bitcoin purchases    ""Bitcoin is a cutting-edge digital currency that can be converted into cash,"" the email explained. ""The checkout process works the same as you're used to. Simply select 'Pay with Bitcoin' as your payment method.""              Fancy also revealed that the option to pay with bitcoin is not yet available on its mobile app, but that such functionality would ""soon be available"".    Another online retailer adds bitcoin    The news comes on the heels of decisions by online computer supply giant Tiger Direct and adult entertainment provider Naughty America to integrate bitcoin payments on 23rd January.      This influx of new companies into the bitcoin ecosystem further provides support for comments made by Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne who suggested other large companies would seek to follow his lead on bitcoin or risk losing market share.      ""You'll see Amazon jump on board. You'll see other large companies - they have to because they cannot concede this whole section of the market to us,"" Byrne told The Associated Press earlier this week.    Impact    Founded in 2009, Fancy has received nearly $80m in venture capital to date, with its most recent Series C round adding $60m to that total. The company was even rumored to be sought after by Apple as a possible acquisition in 2012.      Fancy earns $3m each month and was valued at $600m as recently as July 2013, meaning it would be one of the larger businesses to begin accepting bitcoin to date.      Further, Fancy has a reputation for innovation in e-commerce. Founder Joseph Einhorn has been heralded for adding more user-friendly functionalities, such as image recognition in product comparisons and user-submitted inventory, to Fancy's website. However, while notable, such additions have yet to become widespread in e-commerce, a development that may suggest a lack of consumer interest in such shopping models.      Past investors in Fancy include American Express, Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes, General Catalyst Partners, Square founder Jack Dorsey and actor Will Smith.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/01/23/pinterest-competitor-fancy-adds-bitcoin-payments,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3246b4144594bbb1490e8a75fd9031aa19b3af0e-829x581.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425340,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwB3h,1390514507,Naughty America Joins Porn.com in Bitcoin Acceptance,"San Diego-based adult entertainment provider Naughty America, which operates a network of 30+ porn websites, is now accepting bitcoin payments.  With the decision, Naughty America joins Porn.com to become the latest major online adult entertainment brand to court the spending power and influence of the bitcoin community.  CEO and founder Andreas Hronopoulos spoke to CoinDesk about the announcement in an exclusive interview:  ""We're in the business of helping people find their fantasies, and our goal is to turn that fantasy into reality without reality getting in the way. For us, that applies to how you're going to process the transactions as well as the type of content that is available.""  Hronopoulos indicated that Naughty America first considered accepting bitcoin after discovering the virtual currency through mainstream news coverage of Silk Road. Six months later, Naughty America will follow the Sacramento Kings and The D and Golden Gate hotel-casinos in Las Vegas to leverage the services of Georgia-based payment processor BitPay.  Websites available on Naughty America's network include: My Friend's Hot Mom, Naughty Office, and My First Sex Teacher – among others.  Bitcoin will go 'industry-wide'  The announcement provides further evidence that Porn.com's decision to embrace alternative currency has marked a turning point in the adult entertainment industry. Hronopoulos is particularly bullish about bitcoin's potential to impact the adult entertainment market, as well as how quickly the industry will adopt bitcoin payments en masse.  ""I think it will become an industry-wide thing within 45 to 60 days ... Naughty America really sets the bar for where the industry heads.""  Of course, this migration could depend on whether Naughty America is able to replicate Porn.com's initial earnings. Porn.com's sales increased by 50% in the immediate aftermath of its bitcoin payment services going live, before settling to a 25% uptick over previous levels.  These strong numbers have resonated in an industry that is increasingly fighting against low- or no-cost competitors empowered by innovations that have allowed amateurs to more easily produce professional-grade pictures and videos.  The bitcoin community may very well have more income to offer the adult industry. Past research suggests that 96% of bitcoin users are male, and that nearly half (46%) are not in a committed relationship.  Opening up the International Market  Hronopoulos indicates that the chief benefit of bitcoin – in addition to fighting piracy – is its promise as an international draw, one that can allow the privacy and anonymity for global purchasers to become more comfortable buying adult entertainment.  ""In the United States, we can use our credit card to go out and buy things. We can go use our credit card to buy adult entertainment, we can use our checking account, all these different things. But, when it comes to these other countries ... look at India, they don't even have kissing in the movies. So, think about those countries and what could happen with something like bitcoin.""  Naughty America offers three-day and seven-day trial subscriptions, as well as monthly and yearly memberships. Alternatively, users can pay for content by credit or debit card, check or phone.  On the cutting edge  This isn't the first time that Naughty America has ventured into uncharted tech territory before its peers.  On 14th January, Naughty America revealed plans to invest in Ultra HD (UHD) content, the proposed successor to the current HD format that offers four times the pixel resolution. The company indicated it would charge UHD users $35 a month for 24 days of premium content, compared to the $25 fee for regular content.  Similarly, another recent Naughty America incentive saw the company begin accepting unwanted Best Buy, Macy's, Target and Walmart gift cards for subscription purchases. The incentive aimed to help Naughty America cash in on the estimated $2 billion in gift cards that go unused each year.  When asked about the potential concerns about accepting the sometimes volatile currency, Hronopoulos remained confident: ""If there are any problems in the beginning, we expect that they'll work out: the ball is rolling.""",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/01/23/naughty-america-joins-porncom-in-bitcoin-acceptance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/643778e02b886393ea3687220f2a7c2fbc1ce373-1000x849.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425316,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHw61h,1390512437,Witness List Revealed for New York Virtual Currency Hearings,"The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has announced the witness list for its upcoming hearings on virtual currencies to be held on 28th and 29th January in New York City.      Notable names from the virtual currency community that will be participating include principals of Winklevoss Capital Management, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss; Jeremy Allaire, the CEO and founder of Circle; Charles Lee, the founder of Litecoin; and Fred Ehrsam, co-founder of Coinbase.      Speaking to law enforcement concerns regarding bitcoin will be District Attorney of New York County Cyrus R. Vance Jr. and Deputy US Attorney for the Southern District of New York Richard B. Zabel, according to a release from Benjamin M. Lawsky, New York's Superintendent of Financial Services.      The news follows the NYDFS' launch of an ""ongoing fact-finding effort"" into virtual currencies in August. The NYDFS formally announced the hearings on 11 January, stating that the intent of the meeting was to ""review the interconnection between money transmission regulations and virtual currencies"" as well as discuss proposed BitLicenses for bitcoin businesses.      The event will be spread across two days and include five panels on topics related to everything from bitcoin investing to academic perspectives on virtual currency. The NYDFS indicated that further updates on witnesses as well as the timing of the speakers may be announced in the coming days.    28th January    Leading off the event on 28th January will be a panel addressing the investment opportunities posed by virtual currencies. Included in this speaker group will be Barry Silbert, founder and CEO of SecondMarket; Jeremy Liew, partner at Lightspeed Venture Capital; Fred Wilson, partner at Union Square Ventures; and Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.      In an interview with CoinDesk, Liew spoke about his addition to the panel and his hopes for meetings.      ""As an investor, one of the things we need quickly is regulatory clarity to ensure small companies don't fail,"" Liew told CoinDesk. ""NYDFS has been proactive about educating themselves and informing themselves and this is part of that process, and I'm happy to be involved.""              The afternoon portion of the event will focus on regulating the still rapidly evolving industry. In addition to Charles Lee, the panel will include Judie Rinearson, partner at Bryan Cave, and Carol Van Cleef partner at Patton Boggs, as well as another as-yet unannounced speaker.    29th January    This day's events will lead off with a panel on regulation given by New York's law enforcement representatives, Vance Jr. and Zabel. Panel 2 will feature Ehrsam and Allaire, as well as an unannounced representative from major online retailer Overstock, which announced its plans to accept bitcoin earlier this year.      Panel 3 will conclude the two-day event with an academic overview of virtual currencies. The panel will include Ed Felten of Princeton University and Susan Athey of Stanford University.    Impact  New York has been active not just on matters related virtual currency, but also in regulating both the tech and financial sectors. For example, in December, regulators moved to crack down on payday lenders and enact policies for mobile phone campaign donations.  As the first state to formally call hearings on virtual currency, New York will likely set the tone for other states with its decision-making, meaning any decisions stemming from the hearings could have widespread implications in lieu of formal federal directions.

42425318,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHw67h,1390506152,Australian Bus Commuters Can Soon Pay Fares With Bitcoin,"A team of mobile developers in Canberra, Australia, is aiming to be the first in the world to allow public transit users to pay for rides in bitcoin via its MyBus 2.0 app.  MyBus 2.0 is a timetable and route-planner app on Canberra's extensive bus network ACTION, which is also the city's primary public transit system. Developers Imagine Team Solutions announced the app now has more than 50,000 active users.  To celebrate that milestone, it turned its attention to ACTION's prepaid fare smartcard system, MyWay. MyWay automatically deducts the correct fare when a passenger touches the card against a reader upon entering and exiting the bus.  Bitcoin fans  Imagine Team's Zakaria Bouguettaya said the developers are ""strong supporters"" of bitcoin and would love to be the first in the world to offer it as a public transit payment solution. They have already developed a similar payment app for person-to-person transactions on iOS, and are putting the finishing touches to an Android version.    ""I personally love what bitcoin is all about, and so we tried to work backwards from use-cases that weren't about hedging and speculation,"" he said.      ""I catch buses as a primary method of travel, so we naturally went in that direction. We also saw a good fit into another app (QuicklyPay.it) we recently launched, where you can pay people in social situations (lunch, movie tickets, concerts, etc). Currently we use credit cards, but we've pushed out an update where you can pay someone using your bitcoins, and the recipients get cash.""    Currently, customers can add value to ACTION's MyWay cards online with a credit card, via bank direct debit, over the telephone or in person at selected shopfronts.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZePKV9kCF8&t=3m35s  Bouguettaya described the bitcoin integration in MyBus app and QuicklyPay.it as using a private wallet to accept incoming bitcoins, and then processing transactions almost immediately (or within 10 minutes) on the other end using a proprietary system Imagine Team built.  Should the bitcoin option become popular, it will probably turn to a more established payment processor like Australia's CoinJar.  Government town  Similar in many ways to Washington, DC (on which it was partly modeled), Canberra is a purpose-built national capital in its own non-state territory (the ACT) with a disproportionately large number of federal government employees compared to other cities in the country.  When Imagine Team posted its bitcoin intentions yesterday on a local internet forum, RiotACT, the response from other residents was generally cynical and negative.  The developers responded by citing high credit card fees paid by government-owned ACTION as the best reason to use bitcoin, and described price volatility problems as ""overhyped"".  ""Perhaps most obviously, there is no risk, only benefit,"" they wrote.  ""If you use bitcoin to recharge your MyWay card, who loses? It may not be an ideal currency, but we’re talking about recharging a MyWay card, not using it ubiquitously for everything ever. At the very least, it's another way to recharge your MyWay card.""

42425328,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHw6Ph,1390501833,The Implications of Bitcoin: Money Without Government,"One of my favorite things about bitcoin is how it's such an all-inclusive tent.  Bitcoin attracts political idealists from the right, political idealists from the left, Silicon Valley technologists, social science academics, philosophers, capitalists, socialists, and even apolitical speculators.  Alex Payne kicked off this latest round of analysis with his blog piece: ""Bitcoin, Magical Thinking, and Political Ideology"". A self-described programmer and secular humanist, Payne worked as an early engineer at Twitter building the service's developer platform and backend infrastructure.  Mostly, he criticizes Silicon Valley for its self-indulgent hyper-capitalism that lacks meaningful solutions to real-world problems. Oh yeah, and he specifically targets Chris Dixon, Andreeseen Horowitz, and their Coinbase investment.  Chris Dixon, Andreessen Horowitz's partner on the Coinbase board, promptly shot back in defense with ""Why I'm Interested in Bitcoin"" where he disavowed himself of any libertarian ideology or ""fantasies of a crypto-powered stateless future"" and instead highlighted bitcoin's technological promise in reforming the mismanaged financial system.  Personally, I prefer Marc Andreessen's recent tribute in The New York Times, ""Why Bitcoin Matters.""  The divide between ideology and technology as the driving purpose behind bitcoin permeates the bitcoin investment community and the Bitcoin Foundation's approach to public policy. Advocating and using a non-political monetary unit is a forceful political statement. Investing in a non-political monetary unit or its infrastructure companies is an equally powerful statement.  The bitcoin network cannot be separated from the bitcoin monetary unit and if the central bank, or the Federal Reserve in the United States, provided an important function, bitcoin would be unnecessary.  Carried through to its ultimate conclusion, the bitcoin unit competes with the government's unit in a modern version of Hayekian currency competition.  More importantly, bitcoin is money without government: just as one cannot separate the bitcoin network from the bitcoin monetary unit, one cannot separate the bitcoin network effect from its central banking implications.  Personal Journey  My personal journey towards bitcoin began in the mid-1990s when David Chaum's DigiCash company and technology debuted in America.  At that time, I was working in Silicon Valley at RSA Data Security's new spin-out company, Digital Certificates International, that later became VeriSign. The new SSL encryption in Netscape browsers relied on these digital certificates for authenticating and securing web servers.  With Chaum's DigiCash technology, for the first time ever, digital bearer features of physical cash could be emulated in software using cryptographic protocols.  This was pure genius and it hit me like a ton of bricks.  During the next two years, I started thinking through scenarios of monetizing equity mutual funds and real estate and how ideas like e-gold could be transformed into digital bearer instruments backed by gold, not just a ledger-based transfer system. I even published a research paper at the London School of Economics.  However, I quickly realized that the centralized nature of these two systems inherently gave them a limited life span due to a single point of 'failure' that could be used for suppression.  Predictably, the political pressures increased with DigiCash needing regulatory approval to operate as an issuing mint within a bank and then e-gold suffering a Department of Justice shutdown and asset seizure at the peak of its epic success.  My thoughts shifted to how precious metals and other commodities could be stored, assayed, and audited without revealing knowledge of their location. This proved to be a very difficult feat.  The Bitcoin Protocol Network Effect  In late 2008, five years ago, a developer named Satoshi Nakamoto devised a protocol which distributed trust across a decentralized peer-to-peer ledger and eliminated confiscation risk by replacing physical assets with a mathematical proof of work.  More than anything, it is these two features that would lead to bitcoin's real world success because the system now had the attribute of survivability. When angels and venture capitalists invest in bitcoin-related business models, they are investing in a survivable protocol – a protocol that will survive political institutions.  [post-quote]  Herein lies the dichotomy: how can VCs knowingly invest in a protocol that survives political institutions when it is those same political institutions that allow them to capitalise on their investments?  Money naturally operates like a virus and that makes digital bitcoin potently viral. It is viral cubed – money on the Internet with a network effect. A monetary unit does not stop expanding until it runs into artificially delineated boundaries or achieves widespread dominance.  It is naive to think that governments believe so much in competitive currencies that they would encourage and accept a digital monetary unit without a central issuer. Some smaller governments may believe in that, but only as a way to use it against certain other governments that currently have dominant monetary units.  What's more likely is bitcoin growth in the developed world constrained by regulatory endpoints, legislative taxing powers, and bans on merchants, but only up to a certain maximum market cap for bitcoin. Sure, we'll let it grow but not too much.  So what is that magical permissible level of adoption where going beyond that point jeopardizes central banking and monetary policy? Is it a $100 billion, $500 billion, $1 trillion market capitalization for bitcoin?  No one really knows, least of all the governments. A $1 trillion bitcoin economy may not be suppressible, but it definitely becomes a less friendly environment with respect to established political institutions.  I guess your viewpoint depends on what problem bitcoin is solving – high transaction fees and complex international remittances or the problem of central banking and the intertwining of money and state.  Fortunately, bitcoin solves for both. But, you can't have one without the other. You can't believe that central banks play an important and necessary role in society and also believe that bitcoin serves as a monetary solution.  I am pro venture capital. Building the bitcoin infrastructure around the world is important, but within certain jurisdictions it can also be a frustrating contradiction. The success of an investment depends less on the execution of a stellar management team and more on the degree of regulatory latitude. For venture capitalists, bitcoin is not like Facebook and Twitter where worldwide market saturation and dominance is the end game for the IPO home run.  Market saturation with bitcoin means that something else lost and it's not a competing cryptocurrency. Therefore, it will be imperative for venture capitalists to remain astute about the evolving political landscape and agile enough in timing their exits.  Andreessen stated in The New York Times article that he's with Ben and Milton when it comes to the promise of reliable digital currencies. However, Bernanke and Friedman were referring to digitized national units, not an alternative and independent numéraire.  The only plausible outcome may be jurisdictional competition. After World War II, wealth flowed to the US dollar as the world's reserve currency.  Now, real wealth flows from the West to the East in the form of gold bullion and claims to natural resources. In the cryptocurrency future, wealth will flow to the regions that facilitate and exploit bitcoin's massive potential for unleashing true economic growth.

42425326,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHw6Lh,1390497762,TigerDirect Becomes the Latest Retail Giant to Pounce on Bitcoin,"Another major online retailer has announced that it is now accepting bitcoin. This time it's TigerDirect.  The company revealed the news on Thursday to much fanfare on its site, with an educational guide to bitcoin and incentives for GPU card shoppers to ""Start Mining with AMD"". TigerDirect will use BitPay as its payment processor, becoming that company's largest client to date. Bitcoin will be accepted only for online purchases, not in physical stores.  TigerDirect's parent company, Systemax Inc. (which includes Canadian subsidiary TigerDirect.ca) is a Fortune 100 company with annual revenues of over $2bn and more than 3,000 employees.    “TigerDirect has always been on the forefront of alternative online payment methods and delivering the most convenient ways for our customers to shop,” said Steven Leeds, TigerDirect's Director of Corporate Marketing.      “With individuals building their own high-powered PCs with parts offered on our site to mine bitcoins, it’s a logical fit.”    Paige Freeman, BitPay's VP of Sales, added: ""We couldn't be more pleased to partner with such a forward thinking, customer-focused company as TigerDirect. Now that they are accepting bitcoin, there will be many others to follow in their footsteps.""  Getting serious  TigerDirect, like fellow electronics retailer Newegg, has been teasing bitcoin plans for a few months now. The time for teasing is over now, though – Overstock.com began taking bitcoin at the start of the year, a good six months ahead of schedule, surprising many who thought its CEO was merely thinking aloud. Payment processor Coinbase jumped on the case as soon as it heard the speculation, and worked without break to develop an implementation.  Online electronics retail in the US is reported to be worth $43.8bn a year. With TigerDirect now officially in the bitcoin camp, there will be greater pressure on Newegg to announce something more definite soon.  Bitcoinstore  , a smaller retailer which launched last February as a direct bitcoin-only challenger to the big online electronics retailers, tried to tip TigerDirect's hand when it posted a tweet on 30th November with a screenshot of its recent orders:    It's amazing just how fast our http://t.co/j3L9er1JMl orders pour in each day! #Bitcoin @amazon @Newegg @TigerDirect pic.twitter.com/AnNK2EzzBG      — Bitcoinstore (@Bitcoinstore) November 29, 2013    TigerDirect replied the same day:    How bad do you want it? #RT this and show us...GO! @Bitcoinstore #StayTuned mwahaha hahahah hah ha.      — TigerDirect (@TigerDirect) November 29, 2013    It was duly retweeted nearly 800 times.  On Christmas Day, a company representative replied to a user's bitcoin request on Facebook with another hint of something to come.  Here come the retailers  Until Overstock.com took the plunge, bitcoin had attracted far more attention from financial world entrepreneurs than Big Retail. Many had been curious, but seemed to be waiting for better payment (and legal) structures to exist before taking action. Eyes were mainly on technology and computer hardware specialist retailers, whose customers were considered more likely to be bitcoin users.  Shopify announced  it would introduce bitcoin payment options for its independent merchants in November. Overstock.com is an online retailer, but it deals mainly in household goods, so it was surprising to people unfamiliar with its CEO Patrick Byrne's anti-government currency beliefs when it announced a plan to accept bitcoin. Byrne named interchange and credit card fees as the chief reason for the business move.  MarketLine  research indicates online retail in the US alone was worth $200.4bn in revenues in 2012. The electronics segment is the most lucrative of all, its customers supplying 21.9% (or $43.8bn) of that total. Having experienced a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11% between 2008 and 2012 despite the economic hard times, online retail as an industry is projected to grow to $371.4bn by 2017.  Industry impact  Other online retailers are no doubt salivating at the thought of keeping more of that revenue in their own accounts, rather than handing it over to banks and credit card companies. They will also be watching closely to see how companies like Overstock.com and TigerDirect handle new consumer issues related to bitcoin, such as how to properly identify and resolve fraudulent purchases, and how such things can be proven.  It will also be a test for payment processors BitPay and Coinbase to address bitcoin's price volatility issues for retailers. But, these new companies coming online are in a new league, with annual revenues on a much larger scale.  The IRS will definitely be looking for its share, though it shouldn't be a problem with bitcoin income being converted instantly to dollars. Some in government, however, still bristle at the idea of large-scale adoption of a currency not under state control. There's no guarantee future retail adopters of different sizes will use one of the large processors, or bother to convert at all.  TigerDirect, headquartered in Miami, Florida, sells electronics online and through its retail outlets and B2B offices. It grew from a software retailer in 1989, absorbing both Circuit City and CompUSA along the way. Parent company Systemax Inc. controls a system of branded e-commerce websites, retail stores, relationship marketers and direct mail catalogs in North America and Europe. As well as TigerDirect, its brands include MISCO, WStore and Global Industrial.

42425325,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHw6Jh,1390493830,LA Satoshi Square Event Attracts Dogecoin Traders,"LA's third Satoshi Square was marked by an increase in media attention and an influx of first-time attendees seeking to better understand all types of cryptocurrency, not just bitcoin, event organizers say.      Held Tuesday 21st January from 18:30 to 20:00 [PST] at Grand Park, a 12-acre public space in the city's center, the event garnered roughly 50 visitors, as well as attention from the local KNBC news team.      Satoshi Squares, such as London's most recent inaugural event, were conceived as a way to initiate newcomers to bitcoin, while allowing an in-person trading platform for established users.      Perhaps most notable about this Satoshi Square is that the uptick in attendance was observed even though the event was competing against other tech gatherings attended by the area's long-time supporters.      Pinguino Kolb, the event's lead organizer and a member of local bitcoin advocacy group Spelunk.in, described the scene to CoinDesk:      ""Most people don't usually show up at the very beginning. Usually, you get there at 18:30 and there's maybe only six people sitting around, but this time a big crowd was there.            At this one, it was all brand-new people who had never been there before.""            Embracing altcoins    A potential contributor to the rise in attendance was the fact that this Satoshi Square was open to all those who wanted to trade altcoins for the first time. Kolb indicated that her group had shied away from inviting altcoin users in the past because the event's app did not support altcoin trades.      This time, however, organizers chose to forego the official Satoshi Square app developed by Josh Rossi and invite other cryptocurrency supporters.      Kolb suggested uncertainty over whether other Satoshi Squares were highlighting altcoin also held back this decision.    Attendance rises, trading falls    Kolb noted that because of the rise in first-time attendees, trading was down at the event compared to previous meetings. Instead of using the app, organizers adopted a less high-tech way for traders to signal each other, using physical flags to alert attendees when someone was looking to buy or sell.      The meetup comes six months after LA's first Satoshi Square event held on 12th June in Grand Park. The inaugural LA Satoshi Square spawned eight trades, with about 4.33 BTC changing hands, according to a Spelunk.in blog post.    Kolb said the group is looking to continue developing its community presence in both the bitcoin and altcoin communities at its next event on 18th February.

42425311,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHw5th,1390491981,Bitcloud: We Will Decentralise and Revolutionise the Internet,"One could hardly accuse Bitcloud's developers of lacking ambition. The small team wants to decentralise the Internet, and possibly even replace much of the Internet infrastructure we use today.  It's quite a goal, and to make it all come together the founders will need quite a few backers, but the concept is rather interesting to say the least. Instead of using processing power to move around digital currencies, Bitcloud wants to use a very similar method to provide Internet services.  Instead of mining cryptocoins, Bitcloud miners (if you can call them that) would allocate their hardware resources to other uses: providing storage, computing or routing. They would be rewarded for their efforts, depending on how much bandwidth or storage they contribute.  Cloudcoins and processor cycles  According to the Bitcloud white paperhttps://github.com/wetube/bitcloud/blob/master/bitcloud.org, the system would be underpinned by a digital currency dubbed ""Cloudcoins"". A key argument in almost every critique of bitcoin and other digital currencies is their lack of intrinsic value. However, it should not apply to cloudcoins: they might not be worth their weight in gold, but they would be backed by actual services provided by the miners.  The network would use a routing process similar to Tor's hidden services, and it would employ a “proof of bandwidth” to ensure only connected nodes generate money – thus avoiding any attempts to fool the network and flood it with useless connections. In essence, this approach would allow “miners” to make serious money, but only if they perform serious services.  To do that, they would need quite a bit of hardware, not just a couple of ASIC rigs running in the basement. However, this approach might attract some serious organisations and companies. For example, if a business has plenty of spare storage and computing power, it could contribute it to the network when its offices are fast asleep and its infrastructure isn't being utilised.  Long way to go  Although it is a very interesting concept, the group admits that there is still a lot of work ahead. The protocol has not been finalised yet, and they need more developers to sort everything out.  The team is still anonymous and according to the BBC, they acknowledge that they are only at the beginning of the project. One application proposed by the group is a decentralised version of YouTube, which could replace traditional video streaming services. Everyone who contributes storage and bandwidth would be compensated along with artists, who would make a buck or two from advertising.  Since it is all theoretical at this point, it is hard to say whether the concept will actually work at this point. Nevertheless, geeks should love it. As the tech industry is focusing on Cloud, SaaS and other services, there is clearly a market for such a network.  Oddly enough, we think environmentalists should like the idea, too. It would drastically improve efficiency, as otherwise unused hardware could be used to contribute to the network. What’s more – the network may be incredibly competitive, as it would reward participants with the latest hardware and the lowest operating costs.

Kay's stand, located on 34th street and 2nd avenue, sells typical newsstand fare, including: cigarettes, prepaid phone cards, magazines and snacks. Perhaps the most noteworthy aspect of the business, however, is that Kay accepts bitcoin, but does not take credit cards. He explained:      ""I think it's riskier dealing with credit card companies than it is with bitcoins. With credit card companies you have chargebacks, whereas with bitcoin you don't.""            [youtube id=""2pEqM0dgQsQ"" width=""620"" height=""360""]  Kay's bitcoin journey    In the video, Kay details his journey to becoming a newsstand owner, indicating that his parents owned a similar small business when he was young. Kay said he left a previous position to follow in the footsteps of his parents, noting that it's a job that he truly enjoys, even if it provides him less income.      The newsstand owner received positive feedback on reddit threads for his ability to understand and advocate for bitcoin. Particularly popular was Kay's prediction that the currency will become more widespread for its potential benefits to international travellers, as well as its security advantages.      ""It's much safer to carry around a phone than it is to carry around thousands of dollars in cash.""              In addition, Kay noted that he has become a bitcoin supporter because he no longer pays transaction fees or any statement fees for accepting payments.    An emerging bitcoin processor    The video was posted to the YouTube account of EasyBitz, a payment processor that provides local businesses with QR codes owners can display to accept payments. EasyBitz sends merchants text messages to confirm the transactions.      The company claims to have been featured in The Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal, however, web searches did not reveal any content on these sites containing the term ""EasyBitz"". StatsCrop.com indicates the site has been live for just two months.    Despite the company's underdeveloped Internet profile, Kay was outspoken about the company and the ease-of-use it provides: ""I get paid on the spot in real-time: no transactions fees, no processing fees [...] it's win-win, both on my part and the consumer's part.""

42425322,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHw6Fh,1390474855,Ethereum Launches ‘Cryptocurrency 2.0’ Network,"This Saturday, a group of cryptocurrency advocates will unveil a new system that they hope will rewrite the rules of cryptocurrency.  Officially titled Ethereum, creators are calling it ""Cryptocurrency 2.0"". It's a decentralized mining network and software development platform rolled into one, and it will allow people to create their own altcoins, among other things.  The project, which will be unveiled at the North American Bitcoin Conference, is the brainchild of Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Bitcoin Magazine, who has also been working on competing browser-based wallets Dark Wallet and KryptoKit. He wants new altcoins to be written for, and run on, Ethereum:  ""You would have no need for mining if you do it on top of Ethereum. That's the thing; Ethereum makes it dead easy to make a new crypto.""  Mining  The Ethereum network uses its own mining technology, Dagger. It utilises some of the concepts in the scrypt mining algorithm to keep the mining process even and fair.  Scrypt (which is used by altcoins like litecoin), was designed to be more friendly to CPUs (and unfriendly to ASIC miners), so that a core elite of powerful ASIC users didn't get an unfair advantage. Slowly, people are circumventing that protection, and developing powerful mining hardware for ASIC, so Dagger tweaks those concepts in an attempt to make things more democratic once again.  Dagger is an initial proof of concept, and the Ethereum team is considering a contest for the best possible ASIC-resistant proof of work. The developers are also looking into proof of stake, and they have developed a new PoS algorithm called Slasher. It solves many problems associated with older algorithms.  Contracts  So, Ethereum is a mining network, but it's also a kind of operating system, on which cryptocurrency 'apps' can run. People write those apps using a programming language designed by the Ethereum team. Then they publish it on the system, in the form of a 'contract'.  A contract is an automated agent on the Ethereum network, with an Ethereum address. It can receive and send transactions, and it stores the balances of those transactions.  If I create 'dancoin', and publish it as a contract on the system, and give you a dancoin address, then you can send me dan coin. Rather than sending it directly to me, though, you send a message to the dan coin contract's address. This message will contain my address, and a value. The contract – which is effectively an app, remember – processes the code, and stores the value.  Colored coins  This makes it possible to create sub-currencies backed by assets, anything from gold and other currencies, to digital property or even securities.  It opens up lots of possibilities, according to the white paper here. One of them is the creation of colored coins, which are altcoins marked with certain properties to reflect digital or physical assets (a stock, a derivative, a car, or a house). Ethereum will be able to overcome some basic shortcomings that have hindered the development of colored coins, says the paper.  Custom currencies are potentially extremely powerful in e-commerce, explains Buterin:  “Paypal dollars are a custom currency. Airmiles are a custom currency. Starbucks gift cards are a custom currency. The potential applications are unlimited.”  Financial derivatives  are another interesting option. They can be implemented in a few different ways and tied with various contracts. This makes complex transactions not only possible, but relatively simple and automated to a degree. One point to note: since there is no enforcement on the network, all financial contracts need to be fully collateralized.  Ethereum can also be used in identity and reputation systems, simply by designing the necessary contracts. It can also be employed in decentralized autonomous organizations, peer-to-peer betting and online gambling, prediction markets, on-chain stock markets or in the insurance industry.  One of the major uses of Ethereum will likely be standardised contracts that will employ specialised data feeds, allowing developers to peg currencies to other currencies, commodities or securities.  Although Ethereum designed to be much more than a currency, the network does feature its own currency, too, dubbed ether. Ether is rewarded to miners and it also serves as a mechanism for paying transaction fees and eliminating spam. It will be sold in an initial fundraiser, but from then on it will be mined, resulting in a permanent linear inflation model. There is no cap, says Buterin.  An operating system for cryptographic finance  So, how does the platform actually work under the bonnet? A contract can be found at its address on the Ethereum network, but what's sitting at that address? The contract's code is there, along with the current state of all its addresses, and the transactions they made in the current block.  But an address is a logical thing: where is this data actually stored? It's stored in every block mined on the Ethereum block chain. And a new block will be mined every minute.  [post-quote]  The most obvious worry is that this would create a massive block chain. Every full client will have a copy of the Ethereum block chain (although not smartphones). If that block chain includes lots of altcoin contracts, each with thousands of individual addresses, that's a lot of data.  Buterin says the team has avoided this using functional data structures. Ethereum stores all of its data as branches of a tree. Only small changes will occur on the tree from block to block, and the system will store the common data between versions of the tree in a highly compressed way.  Ethereum also dispenses bitcoin's input and output-based mechanism, instead just storing one object with a balance, per address.  Client P2P protocol, currency  The group is working on clients for Ethereum in at least three languages, Buterin says. Windows, OSX, Linux and likely web browsers and Android will be supported.  When asked how securities regulation might affect certain types of Ethereum contracts, Buterin explained that the most interesting legal challenges will revolve around decentralized autonomous corporations (DACs). The trouble with DACs is that nobody owns a traditional stake and the ownership is allocated by the Ethereum networks, or other decentralized application platforms. Buterin continued:  “Decentralization in general is a very new topic for regulatory agencies, and we've been seeing that all too plainly with Bitcoin. Some laws simply no longer apply, many other laws still do apply, and other laws fall into a murky middle where at least initially it will end up in a regulatory agency's discretion.”  He also pointed out that Ethereum plans to participate in the Consortium of Decentralized Applications (CODA).  Who's involved  The people associated with the project give it traction. Buterin is one of four core developers, all of whom will get a cut from the initial fundraiser.  One of these developers is Charles Hoskinson, founder of the Bitcoin Education Project, and now-departed co-founder of Invictus Innovations. Another is Anthony Di Iorio, founder of the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada, who is also founder of KryptoKit, which Buterin says will become an Ethereum wallet.  The team is also working closely with several other players. Humint, the branded coin project, are considering basing their platform on it, Buterin says. he says. The fourth core member of the team is Mihai Alisie is the creator of Bitcoin Magazine, where he works with Buterin.  Buterin has been a prominent member of the bitcoin community since 2011, and last year he quit university to pursue bitcoin opportunities full time. He also spent a lot of time working on colored coins and Mastercoin last year. However, he left when Mastercoin decided to work on top of Bitcoin.  “The projects were being significantly hampered from reaching their full potential. So I came up with the idea for Ethereum in November to fix these issues, and create a superior platform for these kinds of protocols to develop and grow on,” Buterin told CoinDesk. Hoskinson added:  ""Ethereum is a totally independent project that doesn't seek to compete with Invictus nor Mastercoin or Colored Coin. Think of these as applications and Ethereum as something a level lower like an operating dystem. We are Android, they are apps.""  Ron Gross, head of the Mastercoin Foundation, said he would publish his views on the initiative in the next few days on his blog.  Technical and legal challenges  Buterin likes to point out that Ethereum development at a bare minimum level is easy, since much of the work has already been done, allowing users to employ off-the-shelf clients.  “The challenge is making the client actually modular, scalable, and most importantly of all secure. That will be the bulk of our efforts over the next few months; continually refining the client, and at the same time continuing to tweak the protocol, so that we can create a cryptocurrency that can actually survive the challenges of real-world usage levels, and real-world attackers,” he said.  This isn't a direct attack on the bitcoin network, but there's no doubt that the group is trying to introduce a host of new features that aren't in the protocol. In fact, they're trying to re-engineer things at a far lower level, creating what the white paper calls the ""Lego of crypto-finance"".  Bitcoin's core developers seemed mostly bemused, although several of them rate Buterin highly.  ""Many altcoin experiments pop up seemingly almost daily. We can wait until the dust settles, and incorporate any highly desirable features into a future bitcoin revision,"" said Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin developer. He added that the Internet was ""the greatest test lab in the world.""

42425323,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHw6Hh,1390471541,US Authorities Reveal Bitcoin Black Market Sting Operation,"A 19-year-old Florida man has been arrested and charged with smuggling and possessing a deadly toxin. Authorities say he sold the illegal substance abrin (known as 'the most poisonous plant in the world') to law enforcement agents for bitcoin through Black Market Reloaded.    Investigators allege that LaBelle, Florida, resident Jesse William Koff had been stockpiling and selling abrin, a natural poison produced by plant seeds, since November 2013.  After months of planning, an undercover agent in New Jersey made the arrest on 18th January, The Associated Press reports.    Notably, subsequent reports detailed step-by-step, how authorities ensnared the website user. Furthermore, this news comes just days after a 25-year-old US citizen was arrested for selling a firearm to undercover law enforcement officials in The Netherlands through an unidentified online black market, suggesting that such websites are emerging as popular targets for US authorities.      Black Market Reloaded was one of a handful of black market websites that gained popularity following the demise of Silk Road. However, due in part to its predecessor's notoriety, its users may be under more scrutiny. New Jersey US Attorney Paul J Fishman confirmed the arrest:      ''He allegedly peddled the poison on a virtual black market of illegal and dangerous good, hidden in the shadow of a secretive computer network favored by cybercriminals. Had this been an actual sale to a real customer, the consequences could have been tragic.""            Orchestrating the sting    Philly.com provided a step-by-step overview of the arrest, noting that undercover Homeland Security personnel in Newark, New Jersey, began the sting by setting up a Black Market Reloaded user account and reaching out to Korff with questions related to abrin, which he was selling on the network.      In subsequent correspondences with the undercover agents, Korff allegedly incriminated himself by making informed statements about the poison as well as the best practices for its use:      ""Actually alcohol would probably be the best because you know they will drink all of it. And they will start to feel flu like symptoms in 48 hours, then it will progressively get worse until they die by the fourth day.""              Korff would later attempt to further calm the agents' fears about the quality of the product, authorities say: “I guarantee it will work ... if you drop the abrin in someone's drink Wednesday he will be dead Friday and there is no way to trace it after 24 hours of ingestion.""      On 31st December, Korff allegedly agreed to sell one dose of abrin for $1,500 in bitcoins. By 5th January, Korff had offered to include an additional dose at the reduced price of $1,000 in bitcoins and provided a bitcoin address for the law enforcement agents to send the funds.    Making the arrest    On 14th January, undercover officers set up surveillance at a rest stop to monitor the drop-off of candles said to contain the deadly poison. Law enforcement agents identified a Buick during the drop off and later traced the car to Korff's home, where he was kept under watch.      Korff was not arrested until he sent undercover officers photographs of the drop-off point as well as the items the buyers had requested to confirm the items had been delivered. Researchers then tested the items for traces of abrin and found ""a detectable amount"" of the substance.      Abrin is particularly deadly poison said to be 75 times more toxic than ricin, another more well-known toxin (as featured on the popular US drama Breaking Bad).      A 2011 medical review article published in the Journal of Bioterrorism & Biodefense described the potency of the poison:      ""Ricin and abrin are among the most lethal plant toxins known to humans. Even minute amounts, if effectively used, could cause considerable injury and mortality. Because of potency, stability, relative ease of production, and worldwide availability of their source plants, ricin and abrin are potential biological weapons.""            Previous arrests involving the controlled toxins have garnered those convicted 15 years in prison, which reports noted was the maximum sentence allowed under the charge.

42425317,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHw63h,1390460049,Leaked Emails From Google Suggest it is Considering Bitcoin Integration,"Last updated on 23rd January at 21:54 GMT      It never hurts to ask: That was the philosophy behind bitcoin advocate and bitcoin classifieds site CoinList.me developer Jarar Malik's decision to email the heads of the biggest tech powerhouses in the world - Apple, Amazon and Google - and inquire as to their stance on bitcoin this week.      This much can be seen in Malik's earnest emails to top tech leaders in which he says ""there's nothing extraordinary"" about himself, other than his willingness to go the extra mile to find out how these industry leaders view the emerging currency.      When none of the top brass answered, Malik says he remained undeterred, choosing to go ""down the ladder"" from Google CEO Larry Page to query Google vice president Vic Gundotra.      This time, Malik, to his own surprise, received a response: Gundotra referred him to Sridhar Ramaswamy, senior vice president of ads and commerce at Google, emails obtained by CoinDesk show.      ""We are paying attention to this issue,"" Gundotra said in the email.              Even more shocking to Malik was that Ramaswamy answered his inquiry promptly with what he considered game-changing news, that Google was exploring ways to incorporate bitcoin into its payments plans:        Elated about his findings, Malik took to Reddit to announce the emails in a post that quickly became a must-read for virtual currency buffs.      Just as quickly as news sources began to pick up on the story, however, Google moved to deny the reports:      ""As we continue to work on Google Wallet, we're grateful for a very wide range of suggestions. While we're keen to actively engage with Wallet users to help inform and shape the product, there's no change to our position: we have no current plans regarding Bitcoin,"" a Google spokesperson told CoinDesk.              The result is the bitcoin community is left with two possibilities: 1. Google is at least open to considering using bitcoin or 2. Google executives misstated their positions on bitcoin.    Malik reacts to the news    Google's public statements stunned Malik, who insists he did not doctor the emails and had no incentive to do so.      Malik noted that he spoke to Google representatives after they were made aware of his Reddit posts, and that they subsequently asked him to moderate a Google survey that would ask ""What would I want Google to do with bitcoin?""      ""Ariel Bardin, Vice President of Payments @ Google has asked me to facilitate a Google Moderator and pose the question 'What would I want Google to do with bitcoin?'. He's promised me he will personally review the results and pass it on,"" Malik wrote on reddit.              In emails to Malik obtained by CoinDesk, Bardin indicated that he was not able to comment on the company's plans for bitcoin.      When last checked, more than 4,500 people had given Google over 1,000 suggestions with 40,000 votes, including novel ideas like adding a bitcoin tip jar to YouTube, an addition that would incorporate aspects of YouTube's competitors like Patreon.    Google's response    Malik contends that the emails he received are real, and that Google is taking the possibility of working with bitcoin seriously. But, he believes the attention his posts received likely caused the company to revert back to its previously stated policies.      ""I think a couple things happened. He probably gets a thousand of emails a day from people bitching about how their email doesn't work and shit like that, he probably spoke off the cuff.            Those were his exact words, I didn't add anything. All I did was black out my name. That's why I was like what the fuck man, people can be nasty.""              Malik was further frustrated by Reddit users who allege that his intentions were to manipulate the price of bitcoin.      ""I can understand the natural inclination for people to call bullshit. I posted screenshots, and yeah, screenshots can be faked, but this one Google spokesman, they're just playing it safe.            If Google is not going to do something bitcoin related, or if they're going take an anti-bitcoin stance or come up with a rival product, certainly none of these guys would have responded to me.""              Google refused to comment on whether the emails were legitimate, however, the company did not denounce them either. Company representatives rather directed us to a CNBC story on bitcoin from last October, suggesting its stance on the virtual currency remains, publicly at least, unchanged.
