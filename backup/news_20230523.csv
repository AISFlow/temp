42420355,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpVGv,1684878742,Bitcoin Climbs Past $27.4K but Remains in Holding Pattern as Investors Continue U.S. Debt Limit Vigil,"Stocks dropped but bitcoin (BTC) continued its stodgy ways in Tuesday trading.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading near $27,200, up 1.1% over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin topped $27,400 shortly before European equity markets opened. For nearly two weeks, BTC has stood range-bound between $26,500 and $27,500 as investors fret over ongoing crypto regulatory issues that have sapped liquidity from markets and macroeconomic uncertainties, including the recent U.S. debt ceiling stalemate.  “After the market tumult of 2022, sideways movement has felt a lot better than downward movement,” Tim Frost, CEO of digital wealth platform Yield App, quipped in an email to CoinDesk, although he added that “it does feel like crypto markets are stagnating. Right now, we simply have existing liquidity moving around in different directions, with really only the crypto true believers and active traders still participating.”  Frost noted that the crypto market’s current capitalization of about $1.3 trillion has remained at a near standstill from a year ago. “There doesn’t yet seem to be a catalyst on the horizon that could move things in either direction,” Frost wrote. “The global macro picture remains uncertain, although more positive, with inflation falling in the US and potentially in the UK and EU in the coming months. Right now, though there’s not much shaking.”  The latest reading on U.S. inflation, based on the Consumer Price Index, came in below 5% for the first time since early 2021, although it remains well above the Federal Reserve's goal of 2%.  Ether (ETH) also remained in its two-week range, changing hands at $1,850, up roughly 1.6% over 24 hours. Most other major cryptos were in positive territory, albeit not by much, with APT and SOL, the native tokens of the Solana and Aptos smart contracts platforms, recently rising 3.8% and 2.1%, respectively. The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto markets performance, recently rose 1.1%.  Stocks fell amid debt limit anxieties, with the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite closing down 1.2% a day after reaching a 2023 high, and the S&P 500, which has a hefty tech component, and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) declining 1.1% and 0.6%, respectively.  Yields on 2- and 10-year Treasurys both reached near their highest levels since March before ticking downward slightly.  Crypto markets received a modest boon on Monday when a leaked document seen by CoinDesk showed a willingness by the European Commission willing to moderate an earlier tough stance on crypto and make it easier for commercial lenders to hold stablecoins and tokenized assets.  Meanwhile, in an email to CoinDesk, Strahinja Savic, head of data & analytics at Canada-based FRNT Financial, wrote that the correlation between the S&P 500 and bitcoin has been dropping since April to -0.23.  “This break in correlation between bitcoin and traditional assets has been a prevailing theme that seems to be continuing in 2023,” Savic wrote. “As some macro catalysts come to a head, like the debt ceiling debate or Fed rate policy, it will be interesting to watch how much bitcoin has decoupled from the broader market.”  Savic also noted that the percentage of bitcoin’s total supply “has remained unmoved for over a year, reaching a new record of 62.13%. “Bitcoin ‘hodlers’ remain committed to the asset at the moment,” he wrote.

42420366,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpVTJ,1684878540,Bitcoin HODLing Has Never Been More Popular,"Investors are hanging onto their bitcoin (BTC) longer than ever – HODLing in industry parlance – according to data from Glassnode.  The proportion of BTC that’s been held for at least a year has climbed to a record 68%, Glassnode data shows, while 55% of bitcoin has been held for at least two years and 40% for three years.  Many analysts consider it bullish when BTC sits dormant on grounds that investors are choosing to hold on rather than sell. The prevalence of buy-and-hold in crypto contrasts with the long-term shift in U.S. stocks, a market where investors now hold assets for dramatically less time than they used to.  Sean Farrell, head of digital assets research at FundStrat, said that being a long-term holder has tended to get more popular over time. The exception is when markets get frothy and investors who bought dips sell their older coins to eager buyers.  “The trend is bullish insofar it means that higher prices are ahead in this cycle and any reticence to sell from current HODLers could result in a mini-supply squeeze,” said Farrell.  He added that looking at long-term holder supply metrics is not necessarily useful for short-term price signals.  Long-Term-Holder Supply, which Glassnode deems as coins held for longer than 155 days, has also seen a new all-time high — reaching 14.46 million bitcoin. “This reflects coins acquired immediately after the FTX failure maturing into long term holder status,” said the report.  Glassnode’s Liveliness metric – which compares the relative balance between HODLing and spending behavior – also shows investors are hanging on. It has fallen to the lowest level since December 2020.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/23/bitcoin-hodling-has-never-been-more-popular,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d7923e3bc2b91d459e1ffc9fe6ef709b7a2f66e-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

12876778,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=534736,1684875646,Fantom (FTM) Secret Weapon: Could This Project Be The Next Big Thing In Crypto?,"Fantom (FTM) is a blockchain project that has gained attention in the crypto space for its unique features and potential. Despite a recent dip in key metrics such as Total Value Locked (TVL), the project has something special that many believe is worth attention. Related Reading: Avalanche Breaks $14 Price Level, Yet Remains Hinged On Crucial Resistance Is Fantom Poised To Disrupt The Crypto World? One of the most important metrics for any blockchain project is TVL, which represents the amount of money invested or held in the network. According to the data researcher for Dune Analytics under the pseudonym “OxFinish”, for Fantom, TVL saw a massive uptrend in the autumn of 2021 during the second Bitcoin run to an all-time high (ATH) but has since fallen to its lowest point in almost two years, currently sitting at approximately $292 million. Interestingly, the TVL correlates perfectly with Stablecoin Market Capitalization, the easiest thing to bridge between blockchains, as seen in the chart above. Moreover, according to Ox, FTM’s price is highly correlated with active users, as evidenced by the recent mini “Altcoin Season” surges in network activity when the price increases. Social dominance and USD transaction volume have also fallen, indicating a complex interdependence of key metrics within the ecosystem. The Rising Star Of Fantom’s DeFi Ecosystem Despite the above, Fantom has a vibrant ecosystem of projects building on it, with one decentralized exchange (DEX) standing out as the backbone of the network: SpookySwap. SpookySwap currently has over 22% of TVL dominance, with only GMX on Arb having a slightly higher percentage at approximately 24%. At one point, the TVL of SpookySwap was higher than the TVL of Avalanche. As an automated market maker (AMM), SpookySwap enables users to trade any ERC20 token on the Fantom network without needing an order book. Instead, the platform uses complex algorithms to determine the price of tokens based on supply and demand. This approach makes it easy for users to trade tokens quickly and efficiently while ensuring that prices remain stable. Furthermore, SpookySwap offers a range of features and benefits that make it attractive to users. It leverages the high speed and low transaction fees of the Fantom network to provide a seamless and efficient trading experience for users. Additionally, it offers a range of advanced features such as limit orders, liquidity provision incentives, and a range of trading pairs. Despite the departure of Andre Cronje, the Fantom creator, the Fantom ecosystem continues to grow and innovate, with SpookySwap leading the way. However, the rise of different Layer 2 (L2) solutions in the crypto space provides comparable benefits to Fantom, making attracting and retaining users more challenging. Related Reading: Is Cardano Poised for A Price Surge? A Look At Its Tight Consolidation However, according to Ox, Looking at the metrics and recent innovations, there is still plenty of potential for Fantom to rise in the next bull market. Although, it will require the project to continue to innovate and stay ahead of the curve to stand out in an increasingly crowded marketplace.

12875868,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=534724,1684872034,"Avalanche Breaks $14 Price Level, Yet Remains Hinged On Crucial Resistance","During the recent weekend, Avalanche (AVAX) witnessed a significant surge in selling pressure, resulting in a bearish breakout. As a consequence, the price of AVAX dipped close to a multi-month low of $13.8. However, on the 24-hour chart, the altcoin displayed a slight upward movement, showing some appreciation. On the other hand, the weekly chart depicted lacklustre performance for AVAX. The technical outlook for Avalanche remains bearish, as both demand and accumulation levels have remained low. The price action of AVAX has been influenced by the undecided nature of Bitcoin (BTC), which recently re-entered the $27,000 range. Related Reading: XRP Aims For $0.50, Hinges on Breaking Through This Price Level This has caused other altcoins, including AVAX, to exhibit uncertainty on their respective charts. The overhead resistance level for AVAX holds significant importance, as surpassing this level could trigger a rally for the altcoin. Conversely, if sellers exert further pressure, AVAX may break its consolidation and fall below its immediate support level, thereby strengthening the bearish sentiment. Broader market strength is necessary for AVAX to reclaim its overhead ceiling. The decline in the market capitalization of AVAX indicates a decrease in buying strength at the current time. Avalanche Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, AVAX was priced at $14.70. It is currently trading in close proximity to its immediate resistance level of $15. A breakthrough above $15 has the potential to propel the altcoin towards $15.80 and ultimately $16. The involvement of buyers in the market is crucial to generate demand and facilitate AVAX’s upward price movement. On the downside, if AVAX fails to sustain its current price level, it may find support at $14 before potentially trading below that level. The recent trading session showed a decline in the amount of AVAX traded, indicating the dominance of sellers in the market. Technical Analysis Throughout May and part of April, AVAX experienced consistently low buying pressure, reflecting a limited demand for the altcoin. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) was below the 40-mark, indicating that sellers had a greater presence than buyers at the time of writing. Furthermore, the AVAX price fell below the 20-Simple Moving Average (20-SMA) line, demonstrating that sellers were the driving force behind the price momentum in the market. A significant move above the $15 price level would help AVAX surpass the 20-SMA line, suggesting a potential shift in momentum and possibly attracting more buying interest. Although AVAX recently returned to the $14 price zone, there are no clear indications of buying strength according to technical indicators. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), provides insights into price momentum. It formed only one green histogram, which does not necessarily signify buy signals at this point. Related Reading: Litecoin Surpasses $90, But This Level Remains Crucial For The Altcoin The Bollinger Bands, which reflect price volatility and fluctuations, have remained wide, indicating that the possibility of price fluctuations cannot be ruled out in the upcoming trading sessions.

The lawsuit claims that Crusoe's technology infringes on Upstream Data founder Stephen Barbour's patent, and that Crusoe developed that technology in full knowledge of this. The Canadian miner is suing for damages and is asking the court to order Crusoe to stop the alleged intellectual property violation.  Crusoe is aware of the complaint and plans to ""vigorously defend itself,"" a company spokesperson said. The firm ""remains confident"" in its own ""intellectual property, which includes five issued patents,"" the spokesperson added.  Barbour applied for a natural gas bitcoin mining patent in February 2017, the same year when he founded his company, according to the lawsuit. Barbour's patent was accepted on Feb. 7, 2023.  ""Crusoe is a follower rather than a pioneer,"" read the Upstream Data complaint, claiming Crusoe developed its products years after Barbour.  Crypto miners like these two work on oil and natural gas wells where excess gas is released, or flared into the atmosphere, adding carbon dioxide equivalents, particularly methane. The miners instead set up power generators that burn that excess gas, extracting energy and using it to power bitcoin mining rigs.

42420365,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpVSH,1684869410,"CoinDesk Indices Trend Indicator Hints at Continued Downturn for Bitcoin, Ether","With one week remaining in May, bitcoin (BTC) is poised to post its first losing month of 2023, down 6.8% thus far. Ether (ETH) is flirting with the identical scenario although its month-to-date decline has been a more narrow 0.78%.  Meanwhile, CoinDesk Indices trend indicator for both assets is now signaling trouble for bullish investors.  The CoinDesk Indices trend indicator for bitcoin and ether (BTI and ETI respectively), shows both assets signaling “downtrend,” a departure from their status for the bulk of 2023. Prior backtests of the BTI and ETI show initial downtrend signals preceding subsequent declines of 47% and 60% between April and June 2022.  The downturns reflect the regulatory issues and macroeconomic uncertainties, including the ongoing U.S. debt ceiling impasse, that have spooked investors. Bitcoin and ether surged over the first four months.  The BTI and ETI trend indicators convey the direction and strength of momentum of each asset. Calculated daily, the indicators classify the assets as residing in one of five distinct categories, ranging from “Significant Downtrend to Significant Uptrend”.  A series of moving averages of different durations, and the extent to which shorter averages cross above or below the longer averages underpins the methodology for the indicator’s signals. The move into the downtrend category indicates that bitcoin and ether’s respective five-day moving averages have crossed below longer term averages and remain as such.  BTC and ETH trading volumes continue to be muted, with volumes on Binance falling below their 20-day moving averages for 11 and 17 consecutive days respectively.  The depressed trading volume comes in concert with 19.4% and 28% declines in BTC and ETH’s average true range. The flat trading ranges of both don’t offer much reason for optimism among investors hoping that bitcoin and ether continue their current four-month streak of gains.  With eight days remaining, bitcoin needs to rise approximately 7.5% to finish above the $29,300 level where it traded to begin May. For ether, a less ambitious 1% gain is needed.  Historically, May has been a relatively solid month for bitcoin and ether, with average daily returns of 0.195%, or approximately 1.4% weekly.

A Look At Its Tight Consolidation,"The Cardano price has consistently remained below the $0.38 zone for the past two weeks, indicating a strong presence of sellers in the market. Despite attempts by buyers to regain strength over the past month, their efforts have been feeble, unable to overcome the bearish sentiment. This persistent bearish price action has resulted in a notable breach of the crucial demand and support zone between $0.37 and $0.38.Over the last 24 hours, ADA has made a slight upward movement on its chart, but the progress has been limited. Similarly, on the weekly chart, ADA has not shown significant advancement. The technical outlook for ADA reflects bearish pressure and a lack of buying strength. Related Reading: Litecoin Surpasses $90, But This Level Remains Crucial For The Altcoin Demand and accumulation remain low as a consequence. Many altcoins have indicated minor price increases, with Bitcoin returning to the $27,000 price. ADA must maintain trading above its immediate support line to break out of its current narrow trading range. If ADA surpasses its overhead resistance, the altcoin could potentially experience a substantial rally in the following trading sessions. The decrease in ADA’s market capitalization suggests an increase in sellers outweighing buyers in the market. Cardano Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, the price of ADA was $0.37. The altcoin is currently experiencing tight price movement within a highly constricted range. Additionally, ADA is approaching a critical support level at $0.36. On the upside, there is an overhead resistance at $0.38. A successful breakthrough above this level could drive ADA’s price toward $0.40. However, if the price fails to sustain its current level, it could drop below $0.36. This would lead to a trading range near $0.34. The recent session showed a decrease in the amount of ADA traded, indicating a slow buying strength. Technical Analysis Throughout this month, ADA has struggled to generate substantial buying strength due to low demand. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits below the midpoint, signaling that selling pressure has prevailed in the market. Furthermore, the altcoin price has recently dropped below the 20-Simple Moving Average (20-SMA) line, indicating that sellers have been driving the price momentum. For ADA to experience a breakout, the price would need to attempt to rise above the 20-SMA line. While other technical indicators may not signal ADA bullishness, the one-day chart reveals some buy signals. The Moving Average Divergence Convergence (MACD) has shown green histograms, indicating a positive price action and momentum.

A bonus, as chronicled extensively in the many selfies posted on Twitter by attendees, is the chance to get face time with arguably one of the most famous known inventors the crypto industry has produced to date: Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.  “You're living literally with Vitalik and see him daily,” said Milica Vulic, who is creating online courses on zero-knowledge proofs. “Today, he was running, and just ran right past me.”  Sharing meals with Buterin is what many participants talk about when reflecting on their time in the Balkan town. “Vitalik and I had dinner … He orders this huge fish, cooked whole, with like salad,” said Patri Friedman, general partner at Pronomos Capital, who stayed at Zuzalu for a month. “That was epic.”  Participants are put up in the Chedi, a five-star hotel overlooking the blue Lustica Bay, or, as the hotel says, a “luxury escape.” If the Chedi won’t do, participants have the choice to rent an Airbnb in the Montenegrin hills; some opt to stay on a yacht or catamaran at bay.  It’s not clear how exactly people get invited to Zuzalu. CoinDesk tried multiple times to be connected with two of the organizers, but we were ultimately unsuccessful, even after the message was conveyed at one point that there were concerns over how the event might be portrayed.  Attendees were less shy about publicizing their inclusion. Twitter was inundated with the posts of visitors from places including China, Nigeria, Spain and Serbia.  Tom Howard, a crypto entrepreneur, investor and one of the people behind the website network0 – “We are focused on building a future where everyone has the ‘option to exit’ to their own self-sovereign system,” the website reads – wrote on Twitter on May 11 that Zuzalu is a “community-led experiment and thus undefined.”  “As a visitor, I found a blend of co-living and intentional community concepts,” Howard wrote. “Many in the community are health conscious, and thus organized group workouts, hikes, cold plunges, saunas, healthy eating, mental health & more.”  In an undated video posted online, a speaker, seated on a beanbag chair next to Buterin, describes daily “rituals that are starting to develop here,” including the surprisingly popular “cold plunges” at 8 a.m. and 1 p.m.  Water temperatures in the bay average in the 60s Fahrenheit in April and May (high teens in Celsius), according to the website SeaTemperature.info.  Tim Beiko, protocol support lead at the Ethereum Foundation, who attended Zuzalu for two weeks during the blockchain's Shapella upgrade, told CoinDesk that he participated in the cold plunges “almost every day, unless I had a meeting or something.”  “Some days there were like three people,” he said. “Some days there's like 20 people.”  The agenda included official business conference–style events, with many sessions taking place at the “Dome,” a structure built by volunteers specifically for the event, about 300 feet from the Chedi. Each week delved into a different theme, like zero-knowledge cryptography, and Web3, though other weeks were not crypto-specific, addressing themes like AI, network cities or longevity.  At night, the Dome hosted dance parties that turned into a club-like atmosphere. Friedman, who tore his ACL but didn’t want to miss out on the parties said, “I thought I wouldn't be able to dance. I love to dance, and I was in a wheelchair.”  “But I actually just went crazy in the wheelchair and came up with wheelchair dances. It was super fun,” Friedman said.  The community-driven atmosphere meant that not everything revolved around the structure.  “Some days, there’s like organized stuff at the Dome, and some days, I don't know, someone’s doing a cryptography tutorial in their apartment,” Beiko said.  Participants were encouraged to explore their own ideas and join in with “experiments” proposed by others, according to Hannah Hamilton, co-founder of Asymmetry Finance, which offers a digital token designed to give investors exposure to liquid staking derivatives.  “There’s like continuous glucose monitors and people are testing what happens to their glucose levels,” Hamilton told CoinDesk in an interview.  She updated her Twitter profile with a photo of herself speaking animatedly in a discussion circle with fellow attendees, including Buterin, who appears to be listening intently. She said she stayed at Zuzalu for a month, and she dialed into Zoom meetings as part of her regular Asymmetry gig.  Buterin didn’t respond to an email from CoinDesk requesting an interview about the gathering.  What set Zuzalu apart from other conference-type events is that it didn’t feel like it was an actual conference, according to participants. “You sort of hang out with people in a bunch of different settings,” said Beiko.  How to score an invite for next year's Zuzalu is still ambiguous. Some participants noted that the organizers are trying to evaluate how they can invite more people, or maybe hold it in a different region in the world that makes it more accessible for travel.  Those lucky enough to make it this year spoke glowingly of the company.  “Every single person here believes they can change the world,” said Hamilton.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/23/zuzalu-is-2-months-in-montenegro-with-crypto-elites-cold-plunges-vitalik-selfies,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e46bf5830f7af14f5c16a8fb977f6163dd7c6495-1920x1079.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420361,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpVN7,1684866955,Coliving Project Cabin Wants to Put Digital Nomads in Nature,"A woodsy, digital-native coliving project is trying to rethink the modern city – with just a touch of crypto governance.  The project, Cabin, escalated that effort Tuesday with plans for the first “network city,” a global alliance of self-governing neighborhoods accessible to “citizens'' who hold NFTs. Project backers say living in these neighborhoods will be cheaper, and more accessible, than the status quo.  A twist on Balaji Srinivasan’s idea of a “network state,” Cabin’s distributed city aims to mix blockchain-based membership with tiny homes and tight-knit communities. Its creator, Jon Hillis, thinks this blend can provide a potent formula to unleash the “fountain of human creativity” he thinks is getting stifled by modern cities.  Hillis says Cabin wants to solve the “loneliness” problem endemic to car-centric suburbanites and single-family homes. His answer is to amass a confederation of cabins in the woods and fill them with like-minded digital nomads and their friends.  These people have already started sorting themselves into online communities, especially in crypto. What Cabin is doing is providing a real-world setting for them to come together, work and live together.  Cabin is what’s known in crypto as a social DAO. Its members hold crypto assets – in Cabin’s case, a “citizenship” NFT as a sign of their participation; they weigh in on neighborhood composition and treasury management through votes denominated in their Cabin governance token.  Each residence is its own “neighborhood” unique from the others and also separately owned. While the ethos behind Cabin crosses all neighborhoods, the rules and regulations can differ from place to place based on their caretaker. Getting “neighborhood” status requires a property to accrue 1000 CABIN token votes in favor.  It's part of “polycentric governance,” says Hillis, who contrasted Cabin’s “governance games” with the sometimes messy and ineffective “up down” votes found in other DAOs.  “We're using these bottom-up polycentric governance structures where we are essentially playing games that are governance but don't necessarily look like governance. Like building on the token curated registry of the city directory – that's something that is actually fun to do.”  Blockchains and tokens provide the tools for Cabin to keep track of membership and impart “a marker of legitimacy” on neighborhoods in the network. They’re also likely to be the focus for many of the digital nomads willing to become citizens.  Hillis said Cabin has already handed out 300 citizenships to long-term members of the Cabin community who can now refer others into the group.  “The goal of citizenship is both to create a financially sustainable way for our community to continue to grow while simultaneously providing a value and vibe alignment check for people who want to co-live in Cabin neighborhoods,” Hillis said.",POSITIVE,없음,REGULATION,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/05/23/coliving-project-cabin-wants-to-put-digital-nomads-in-nature,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d26c23be9915fd5f8d70418949bbddf4a3a66863-3000x2000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42420358,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpVK1,1684866844,Consensus Survey: TradFi Investors Remain Bullish on Crypto’s Long-Term Prospects,"At last month’s Consensus 2023, CoinDesk hosted two invitation-only Investor Manager Roundtables, one designed specifically for institutional investors (35 pensions, single family offices, sovereign wealth funds, and endowments and foundations) and the other for asset allocators (50 fund of funds, asset managers, and pension consultants).  With the help of AIMA’s Michelle Noyes (thank you, Michelle), I presented the same 10 survey questions to both groups and recorded their responses in real time to get a sense of how these mostly TradFi investors are thinking about crypto. (About half of the managers were “crypto natives”).  Angelo Calvello, Ph.D., is co-founder of Rosetta Analytics, an investment manager that uses deep reinforcement learning to build and manage investment strategies for institutional investors.  The lede: So after the spectacular collapses of FTX and Celsius and the crypto bear market, how are institutions feeling about the future of digital assets? Astonishingly bullish, with almost 70% of institutional investors view crypto investing favorably, while over 95% of managers do so.  Another indication of the groups’ bullishness is their responses to, “When will we see large-scale institutional investments in crypto?” 32% of institutional investors said it is already here, with 16% saying they expect it in 1-3 years and 36% in 3-5 years. (Keep in mind this group self-identifies as long-term investors). Only 4% said large-scale institutional investment will never occur.  Managers were less bullish on the short-term prospects, probably because they have seen an immediate decline in AUM, with just 12% agreeing “it’s already here.” However, 46% expected such adoption in 1-3 years and 30% in 3-5 years. Unlike institutional investors, the managers could be talking their own book.  Read more: Angelo Calvello - 5 Ways TradFi Investors Are Rethinking Crypto in the Wake of FTX  The relative bullishness of both groups’ responses was surprising, given their single greatest concern was U.S. regulatory uncertainty (72% institutional investors and 76% managers). I would have expected both groups to be decidedly bearish or at best neutral on crypto investing and their outlook for crypto to have diminished, especially because the survey was administered after the Coinbase’s Wells Notice, SEC Chair Gensler’s April 18 testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, and the widely held view that this regulatory uncertainty is likely to continue for a while. A handful of institutional investors also expressed concern about cyber fraud and market manipulation, while several managers were concerned with subject complexity and volatility.  Almost 70% of institutional investors view crypto investing favorably, while over 95% of managers do so  Yet, their responses to “What event is most likely to be the catalyst for investing, or increase your investment, in crypto?” reveal a pent-up demand. Both groups selected “clarify the U.S. regulatory framework” as their number one catalyst (60% of institutional investors and 64% of managers). And, harkening back to my maiden CoinDesk op-ed in February, their second choice of a catalyst was “solid investment opportunities” (32% of institutional investors and 27% of managers). So, crypto still needs to put on big boy pants if it is to attract serious TradFi investments.  The events of 2022, including the FTX scandal, did little to change their sentiment toward crypto investing, but these events are causing many institutional investors to upgrade their due diligence processes. 85% of institutional investors admitted they would improve their due diligence by spending more time vetting deals (52%), demanding more transparency on deals (52%), and digging deeper into operational risks (48%). (This survey question allowed respondents to make multiple choices.)  Read more: Angelo Calvello - Why Financial Analysts Missed Silvergate’s Red Flags  Their enhancements reveal that they have learned from both Perhaps Ontario Teachers Pension Plan’s and CDPQ’s write-downs of their investments in FTX and Celsius that as fiduciaries their due diligence of crypto investments must be at least as rigorous as that used for TradFi investments.  Managers also ‌plan to change their diligence processes, spending more time vetting deals (36%), demanding more transparency (42%), and digging deeper into operational risks (36%). Yet, investors beware: 27% said they would make no changes, leading me to wonder how a manager could have such hubris given their target market’s responses and Sequoia’s (and other managers’) FTX experience.  Because much has been written in the past twelve months about BTC’s inherent investment benefits, we asked the groups the following (the groups’ percentage responses are in brackets): Do you believe BTC is....  A store of value (20% for institutional investors/43% for the other allocators)  A portfolio diversifier (28%/30%)  An inflation hedge (4/0)  A hedge against banking infrastructure (12%/15%)  A reserve currency (12%/6%)  A medium of exchange (16%/3%)  A venereal disease (a la Charlie Munger) (8%/3%).  Institutional investors cast votes for the predictable favorites, with most considering bitcoin a store of value and a portfolio diversifier and a handful viewing BTC as a hedge against banking infrastructure, a reserve currency, and a medium of exchange.  However, only 4% of the institutional investors and none of the managers considered BTC as an inflation hedge, rejecting the trope advanced by TradFi analysts, crypto insiders, and the media in 2021 and 2022. Who would have thought BTC as an inflation hedge would garner fewer votes than Charlie Munger’s metonymy?  For our final question, I asked, “What investment theme are you most excited about over the next 12 months?” And both groups’ responses were again bullish: institutional investors and managers selected the tokenization of funds and/or real assets as their top choice (52% and 52%). Surprisingly, at least to me, 20% of institutional investors and 24% of managers chose “long BTC/ETH,” while 16% of institutional investors selected “gaming.”  I’ll admit that this survey was less than scientific and skewed: the participants chose to attend Consensus and accepted invitations to these private sessions, so this is a self-selecting group Yet its overall bullishness bodes well for the crypto industry and crypto investing but with the proviso that the U.S. state and federal regulators reach a consensus that, borrowing a term from environmental policy wonks, is loud, long, and legal.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Angelo Calvello,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/05/23/consensus-survey-tradfi-investors-remain-bullish-on-cryptos-long-term-prospects,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/023d7641bdfea72773dd81d2089e3082f70da5f7-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Trends In Bitcoin Social Volume May Have Influenced The Price Recently As the on-chain analytics firm Santiment explained, BTC generally moves in the direction the crowd isn’t expecting. The relevant indicator is the “social volume,” which measures the total number of social media text documents discussing a given term or topic. The social media text documents here refer to a collection of social media posts collected by Santiment that have been sourced from various popular platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and Telegram. This indicator only checks whether a text document in this collection mentions the term at least once; posts with more than one mention of the topic are still given the same weight as a document that only does it once. To use this indicator for pinpointing discussions related to market sentiment, the analytics firm first found the social volume of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general. Then it filtered it for some specific terms that refer to the investors’ mentality. Related Reading: How Does Current Bitcoin Rally Compare With Historical Ones? Here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin social volume for negative and positive sentiments over the last week: The trend in the two market sentiments for BTC over the last few days | Source: Santiment on Twitter The terms used here to separate the discussions related to positive sentiment are buy, bullish, and bottom. Similarly, sell, top, and bearish are some of the terms that have been used for finding negative talks. In the graph, Santiment has marked the pattern that the social volumes of these sentiments followed during the past couple of days. On the 21st, following the decline in the asset’s price, the indicator’s value for the negative mentality observed a large spike. Related Reading: Former MicroStrategy CEO Says Bitcoin Rally Just Getting Started This means that social media discussions had gotten quite bearish when this price drop occurred. However, once this mentality shift happened, the cryptocurrency saw a local bottom formation. Over the next day, the coin saw some rise and broke back above the $27,000 level. While this rise was taking place, the sentiment again turned positive. By the time the price went above $27,000, though, the social volume of the greedy sentiment had reached pretty high values. Like when the negative sentiment had become overwhelming, the bottom had formed, a top occurred following this positive mentality spike. Historically, the Bitcoin market has generally always moved like this; whenever the sentiment becomes too unbalanced towards any particular side, the market tends to show moves opposite to this sentiment held by the majority. BTC Price Since Santiment posted its analysis and the flush in the positive sentiment, Bitcoin has again risen above the $27,000 mark. When writing, the coin is floating around $27,300, up 1% in the past week.

42420357,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpVIz,1684864040,Crypto's Open Source Ethos Yields Results,"Polkadot, the blockchain created by legendary coder Gavin Wood after he split from Ethereum, is getting a new privacy feature. The tool uses zero-knowledge proofs and soulbound tokens (yes, the things dreamt up by Vitalik Buterin) to help limit the amount of information crypto users share when they transact on-chain.  Meanwhile, a new interoperable NFT standard has launched on Cosmos.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  In particular, a layer 1 Polkadot blockchain called Manta Network has teamed up with the team behind the rollup-based scaling tool Linea to build a “zero-knowledge soulbound tokens” (zkSBT) that will allow users to selectively reveal their digital identities when interacting with apps (essentially shielding their on-chain transaction activity).  And the new Cosmos NFT standard – called ICS-721 in homage to Ethereum’s ERC 721 NFT standard – will unlock a type of non-fungible asset that can be traded across blockchains.  The stories mentioned aren’t really connected (different tech, different chains, different use cases), except in the sense that they’re part of the same broader trend in crypto: the winter is for hunkering down and building. Despite being a cliche, this is worth bringing up now and again because it reveals the level of ingenuity and cooperation across crypto.  There are other industries where information-sharing is the norm, and the “free and open source” movement has been going for decades, but it is in crypto that cross-pollination hit its stride.  Vitalik Buterin blogged about the idea of soulbound tokens – a kind of blockchain-based curriculum vitae that follows a person throughout their life keeping record of their achievements, which cannot be traded or sold – in mid-2022, offering the idea to anyone to play around with. Perhaps because of the Extremely Metal moniker, SBTs gained a lot of attention and inspired others to write about how such an asset would revolutionize society.  Obviously ideas are cheap (inspiration strikes when it wants, and no amount of money will summon it) – and it’s harder to build. That’s why seeing a real-life deployment of soulbound tokens is so interesting.  Perhaps because of the amount of money still sloshing around, perhaps because of the type of people the industry attracts, there is tremendous amount of technological experimentation that happens in the crypto industry.  Nowhere else is this more visible than in zero-knowledge (ZK) cryptography, which was essentially limited to a branch of academic research since the mid-80s when computer scientists Shafi Goldwasser, Charles Rackoff and Silvio Micali (yes, the Algorand guy) coined the term. Although the concept is simple enough – deploy a system that allows one party to prove to another that some statement is “true” without showing all his cards – crypto was really the first industry to put ZK-proofs into widespread commercial use. It’s now used to help scale Ethereum, protect wallets and now that new Polkadot-based tool.  Sure, maybe the honor really belongs to the pioneering advocates for open-source code, who saw what could be built with software and the pressure to commodify it and championed for researchers to share their findings and publish code under permissive copyright licenses. These are figures like Linux’s Linus Torvalds and O’Reilly’s Tim O'Reilly – figures who helped build the internet we know today.  And because so much of crypto is open source, the industry is also open to abuse. At the low-end level this essentially opens the door for spammers to fork projects endlessly to create meme coins. And at a scarier level, nation state actors including North Korea, which has turned abusing permissive blockchain tools into a major source of income.  But whether you’re a Bitcoiner who thinks Ethereum is good if only because it’s essentially a free research project into tech that may find its way onto Bitcoin, or a FOSS zealot like Richard Stallman who wrote the “GNU Manifesto,” making the case that giving users control over their own computers is a moral imperative there’s likely more good than harm that comes from open source code.  At a time when crypto is being hounded by regulators (at least in the U.S.), it’s worth highlighting some of the benefits of crypto. Just today, Ledger CEO Pascal Gauthier announced a roadmap to open-source more of the firm’s hardware wallet after pressure from the crypto community over its proprietary “Ledger Recover” software update.  See also: StarkWare to Open Source Its Ethereum Scaling System  Open-source increases transparency, and likely also spurs competition and cheaper prices. Tech companies need to drive innovation, if they want anyone to pay for a product that otherwise might be free. OpenAI the once non-profit dedicated to AI safety that’s now a glorified Microsoft plugin is a case in point: CEO Sam Altman has all but said the company has no moat against the proliferation of free and open AI alternatives (something Google execs actually did say).  Not everyone will be convinced by the benefits of “open collaboration.” And I could personally see the case for keeping some technological secrets under lock and key – like how to enrich nuclear weapons – and basic intellectual property protections.

Commingling was done almost every day in Binance's accounts at failed Silvergate Bank ( OTC:SICP ), Reuters reported citing three sources. While the amounts couldn't be verified, Reuters reviewed a bank record that showed Binance mixed $20M from a corporate account with $15M from an account that received customer funds in 2021. The claims indicate internal controls failed to ensure that customer funds were separate from company revenue, thereby putting client assets at risk, the report cited three former U.S. regulators as saying. Patrick Hillmann, Binance's chief strategy officer, slammed the report, saying the company has been public about its regulatory shortcomings in the past. ""This story is so weak that they had to put up front, 'Reuters found no evidence that Binance client monies were lost or taken', to protect themselves from a libel suit,"" he said . ""They then pinned 1K words of conspiracy theories (which we explained were false) with zero evidence other than a former insider."" Binance did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

42420364,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpVRF,1684861527,The Bitcoin Mining Debate Is Ignoring the People Most Affected,"THE TAKEAWAY:  New York-based crypto mining facility Greenidge Generation has found itself at the center of state and national debates about the impact mining firms have on the environment and their local communities.  In New York at least, this debate has led to legislation targeting companies like Greenidge.  While the rhetoric used by all sides in the larger bitcoin mining debate is often based on misinformation, in upstate New York environmentalists are actually influencing legislation with arguments that are full of inaccuracies.  But locals who live near the facility say they’ve been cut out of the conversation, and the broader debate ignores the role Greenidge plays in their lives.  DRESDEN, N.Y. — Last year, Gov. Kathy Hochul signed a two-year ban on new crypto mining facilities powered by carbon-based energy sources, such as gas power plants.  The landmark New York law came after months of debate about the impact bitcoin (BTC) mining was having in the state. Members of a local union and residents near Greenidge Generation, a power plant that mines bitcoin at the center of this debate, opposed the moratorium. Supporters of the bill argued the plant was responsible for spewing hot water into the glacial lake, killing thousands of fish and contributing to toxic algal blooms that were harmful to other aquatic life.  The bill's supporters, including New York Assemblywoman Anna Kelles, a Democrat who represents a number of towns south and east of Cayuga Lake, national environmental groups like Earthjustice and the Sierra Club and hyperlocal groups like the Seneca Lake Guardian, heralded its passage as a major victory. Now, they’re taking the fight national.  This year alone, Kelles has testified before the U.S. Senate's Environment and Public Works Subcommittee and the Pennsylvania House of Representatives' Environmental Resources and Energy Committee. Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), who chairs the Senate panel, called the hearing “one of the most informative hearings that Congress has had in a long time.”  “Facilities like Greenidge also negatively impact aquatic life, killing thousands of fish every year and increasing the risk of harmful algal bloom outbreaks that are toxic for both wildlife and humans,” Kelles said during the Senate hearing.  But there’s a big problem: Much of the rhetoric used by Kelles and her allies, while surely well-intentioned, isn’t true. Many of the statements made by environmentalists – for example, that Greenidge is causing the average temperature of Seneca Lake to rise, or causing harmful algal blooms, or emitting jet engine-loud noise – are easily disproved by state-collected data and in-person experience.  At the same time, lobbyists and advocates for the industry are breathlessly touting the potential benefits of bitcoin mining more and more, saying this sector of the crypto industry could boost investments in renewable or clean energy and bolster energy grids that otherwise would have no reason to be improved. The most fervent of these bitcoin advocates attack anyone who disagrees with them. This month, someone hacked Kelles’ Twitter account while she was testifying about bitcoin mining before lawmakers in Pennsylvania, and used her feed to promote pepecoin (PEPE), a meme coin that was enjoying its 15 minutes of fame.  These debates have become highly politicized, a near-intractable conflict between environmentalists and bitcoiners that is, on its face, an environmental debate and, at its core, a philosophical debate about value that the cryptocurrency industry provides to the world – and whether that value is worth shouldering a clear, and potentially heavy, environmental cost.  The debate around mining has thus far only picked at this philosophical conversation, without really getting into the nuances. Nor is CoinDesk making an attempt to answer the question of whether bitcoin mining is “worth it.”  New York, along with Texas, has become a hotspot for that debate, and Greenidge has become an unlikely poster child. Though other mining facilities, such as Riot Platforms’ center outside of Austin, Texas, have played bigger roles in the bitcoin mining debate, Greenidge occupies a prominent spot in discussions in Albany (New York’s capital city) and Washington, D.C.  It’s important to note that Greenidge occupies a unique role, and it’s difficult to directly compare these different facilities and how they affect the communities around them. Riot taps into an existing (sometimes shaky) energy grid, while Greenidge generates its own electricity. Other mining facilities, such as those in upstate Washington, might rely on a limited amount of power or use power paid for by the community as a collective, meaning the costs from an increase in usage get passed along to everyone regardless of how much power each individual may use. A county in Tennessee is suing a local mine in part due to the noise it generates, a complaint that some locals in Dresden say doesn’t apply to them.  The debate and media coverage around Greenidge have become part of a snowballing collection of misinformation that doesn’t take into account the reality on the ground in Dresden, New York.  Misinformation snowball  This misinformation snowball consists of both minor statements exaggerated in the national discourse and massive campaigns built on faulty assumptions.  For example, in July 2021, Abi Buddington – a local environmental activist with a house and land on Seneca Lake – told NBC that the lake was “so warm you feel like you’re in a hot tub.” Buddington’s remark was picked up by major outlets including Ars Technica and Business Insider.  Buddington later clarified that she meant not the lake itself, but the water near Greenidge’s discharge pipes (the facility uses water from the lake for cooling, as it has since it was built in 1937 as a coal-fired power plant) in Keuka Outlet.  And while Buddington was correct in asserting that Greenidge is putting warmer water back into the lake than it takes in, the water discharged is nowhere near the “hot tub” temperature or 108 degrees Fahrenheit activists and Kelles claim it is.  The average temperature difference between Greenidge’s water intake and its output is between 9 and 13 degrees – making it roughly 32 degrees below the level permitted by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, a Greenidge spokesperson said in response to CoinDesk’s inquiry. NBC News reported that 108 degrees is the maximum allowed temperature for water Greenidge puts back into the lake, contradicting Kelles’ claim that that was the actual temperature of the water discharge. The local activists at Seneca Lake Guardian accused Greenidge of strawmanning its critics, asserting that “no one ever said” Greenidge was discharging water at that temperature, but Kelles has said so often, including in a February 2022 press release.  Furthermore, the average temperature of Seneca Lake has remained generally consistent over the past few years, Vice News’ Motherboard reported, citing data from scientists at local Hobart and William Smith Colleges.  According to Motherboard’s investigation, the college has recorded a steady, annual 0.2 degrees Celsius rise in temperature for Seneca Lake since the mid-1990s, indicating the lake is warming slowly, but that rise has not been correlated with Greenidge’s operation.  Despite Buddington’s subsequent clarification, the ball was already rolling. In December 2021, less than six months after NBC’s article was published, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) sent a letter to Greenidge Generation’s CEO demanding information about the firm’s impact on climate change and the local environment. Her letter cited local residents’ concerns about “the temperature of water outflow.”  The water temperature misrepresentation is just one example of how an incredibly nuanced subject has become something of a political and emotional flashpoint for environmentalists and bitcoiners alike.  Complicating matters, bitcoin mining’s supporters have too-often chosen to combat misinformation with misinformation of their own or, at best, bad-faith trolling.  A recent video from Riot Platforms in response to a New York Times article about the pollution created by bitcoin mining facetiously claimed that “bitcoin mining has zero carbon emissions” based on indoor carbon dioxide testing at the Riot mining facility in Rockdale, Texas.  If taken at face value, that would obviously be a disingenuous statement. If it’s a joke, as Riot claimed after receiving online backlash, it wasn’t widely recognized as such and served mainly to incense the other side.  It is not a question that bitcoin mining is energy intensive. In 2020, the most recent year data is available from the New York Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC), Greenidge emitted a massive 288,440 tons of carbon dioxide into the air.  Some locals are OK with that, given the benefits the facility brings.  Steve Griffin, a native of New York’s Yates County and the CEO of the Finger Lakes Economic Development Center, a quasi-governmental organization tasked with growing the economy in Yates, said that despite Greenidge’s emissions, concerns that it’s harming local wildlife may be overblown.  ""We know the value and the importance of the lakes' worth and in our environment or climate. I mean, we're a big agricultural community, we know what the value is of the climate,” he said. “We wouldn't want to incentivize anything that was going to clearly negatively impact that.""  Other examples of the misinformation surrounding the Greenidge debate range from debates about how many employment opportunities it provides to the impact it has on the local electricity grid.  Local voices like Griffin’s have been largely drowned out amid the debate over Greenidge, and crypto mining more broadly.  Local voices  In mid-2022, CoinDesk reporters traveled to the Finger Lakes region to visit the small towns near Greenidge’s facility on Seneca Lake, and talked to local residents, businesses, town officials and union workers to learn how they viewed the refurbished power plant.  The visit was, according to the village of Dresden’s mayor, William Hall, unprecedented. Despite the media circus surrounding Greenidge, Hall said he’d never once been contacted by a reporter, lobbyist or politician about Greenidge. This includes both the bitcoin advocates using Greenidge as an example of a successful business and the critics saying it was harming the local environment.  When CoinDesk contacted Hall again in May 2023, his staff confirmed that no one had called or visited him to speak about Greenidge since our last visit.  “Nobody has ever come to talk to us about it,” Hall said. “We need people from somewhere to take an interest, to come talk to the people that are benefitting [from Greenidge’s presence], not the anti-[Greenidge] people that don’t even live here.”  In Hall’s telling, only the so-called “cottage people” – wealthy out-of-towners with lake houses or plans to retire on Seneca Lake – were upset about Greenidge’s presence. One of the “cottage people” Hall referenced was Buddington.  “We had a lady down on Arrowhead Beach that was very, very involved in the anti-[Greenidge] side,” Hall said. “[Buddington and her husband] are Rochester residents, eventually going to live here when they retire, which I understand. She told the press that the water in front of her cottage was bathwater warm. And that morning, someone had already checked the temperature and it was in the 40s.”  Buddington did not respond to a request for comment.  Most of the 300-odd residents of Dresden, Hall said, support the plant. They were familiar with its long-time presence on the lake, and grateful for the contributions its executives had made to the community, such as covering part of the cost of an expensive new CT scanner for the local hospital and a hydraulic “jaws of life” rescue system for the fire department, where the 75-year-old Hall is still a volunteer firefighter.  There were (literal) signs of Greenidge’s investment throughout Dresden. The company sponsored a local playground for children, as well as an electronic sign welcoming people to the village.  Many of the individuals CoinDesk spoke to, including local residents and business owners, agreed that Greenidge’s presence on the lake was good for the region – if they had an opinion on Greenidge at all.  Air permit denied  CoinDesk spoke to Hall less than two weeks after NYSDEC decided to deny Greenidge’s application to renew its Title V air permit – five-year permits required to operate facilities deemed as high polluters (Cornell University, for example, is another facility in the region with a Title V Air permit).  The decision came after a lengthy campaign against Greenidge by environmental groups, in which 4,000 letters were submitted to NYSDEC – 98% of which were anti-Greenidge.  Though Greenidge was operating within the limits set by its NYSDEC-granted permits, the Department claimed its decision to deny the renewal application was “based on the determination that the facility’s continued operation would be inconsistent or would interfere with the attainment of the Statewide greenhouse emission limits” established by the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA), an ambitious plan to reach zero net emissions by 2050.  “The very first hearing, they bussed people in here. You couldn’t move in the village. But they were not residents, they came from a long ways away.""  Three months before NYSDEC’s denial, however, Greenidge argued that it was already compliant with CLCPA guidelines and even proposed adding two new binding emissions limits to its renewed permits – to reduce permitted greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by the end of 2025, five years before the CLCPA’s first targets in 2030, and to become a zero-carbon-emitting power generation facility by 2035.  The issue, to Hall, felt so cut-and-dried in favor of Greenidge that the massive outcry against it came as a shock.  “Through this whole thing, the [pro-bitcoin] groups have been weak,” Hall said, noting that the environmentalists, on the other hand, have mounted a strong campaign.  “The very first hearing, they bussed people in here. You couldn’t move in the village. But they were not residents, they came from a long ways away,” Hall said.  “It upsets me to the point where I get …” Hall trailed off. “You look at some of these [environmental] groups that have been going for hundreds of years, with all kinds of money and political backing, and they come here into a little-bitty community, and this is what happens. They just overrun you.”  No good jobs  Hall and other local supporters of Greenidge don’t care much about bitcoin. What they do care about, however, are jobs.  To be clear, Greenidge – any bitcoin mining operation, really, despite arguments by many bitcoin miners – is not a major employer in the region. Running a bitcoin mining operation just doesn’t require that many people, and most of the jobs created are either temporary construction roles or low-wage positions like maintenance or security.  But, in upstate New York – a region once defined by a plethora of well-paid and unionized manufacturing jobs that have dried up – a job is a job. Many towns that were once filled with working-class families have withered as the plants that provided their residents’ jobs closed and moved overseas. The Finger Lakes region is no exception.  Griffin, of the development center, said Greenidge employs 54 people, paying roughly twice as much as the traditional manufacturing salaries in the area.  Griffin, who is also a basketball coach at the local high school, told CoinDesk that it was rewarding to see some of his students go to work for Greenidge after graduation.  “Kids I used to coach are now working near home, where you never would have expected that. Their parents sure wouldn’t have expected their kids to be able to live near them, making more money than they probably made out of college,” Griffin said. “It’s honestly everything from an economic development perspective you’d hope it to be.”  Mike Davis, the business manager of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 840, said Greenidge is an important source of work for union members, especially during slow winter months when construction normally slows down.  IBEW’s workers, Davis said, have good paying jobs – especially by local standards, where the major employer is the region’s $3 billion agri-tourism industry, which mainly provides low-paid and often part-time labor and hospitality jobs. A junior wireman, according to Davis, makes $38.95 per hour, with an additional $20 per hour in benefits.  In the summer months, Davis said Greenidge typically needed six to eight of the Union’s electrical workers at any one time, but that number was closer to 40 in the winter months – the company deliberately scheduled certain upgrades and similar operations for those winter months, Davis said, so as to keep these workers employed.  If Greenidge were to shutter its operation, Davis said, winters could be tough to find enough work to keep all his members paid.  “It would probably affect 10 to 15 families,” Davis said. “If there’s 15 less people working at Greenidge over the winter, there’s 15 less jobs in the area for me to send people to.”  IBEW, which has chapters all over the country, has been vocal in its resistance against Kelles’ push to pass the mining moratorium. The Union’s opposition was responsible for killing Kelles’ first attempt at passing the bill in a previous Assembly session, but was not enough to stop the bill from ultimately prevailing in Kelles’ second attempt.  Kelles did not return CoinDesk’s multiple requests for comment.  Mythbusting  It is understandable, perhaps, that lawmakers and local activists would be willing to sacrifice a few dozen union jobs to protect the environment surrounding Seneca Lake.  In their telling, Greenidge is a monstrosity, a gas-guzzling “cancer” that blights the otherwise serene, rolling hills surrounding the glacial lake, as Yvonne Taylor, vice president of Seneca Lake Guardian put it in a press release,  Activists like Taylor express anger that the power plant, built in 1937 but mothballed in 2011, was purchased by a Connecticut-based private-equity firm, converted to a natural gas–fired plant and brought back online – something they see as a step backward.  Easily disproved is Kelles’ assertion that the area surrounding Greenidge sounds like standing near a “jet engine on a tarmac.”  When CoinDesk visited the facility last summer – standing outside, because Greenidge, which has been notoriously tight-lipped with the press, did not respond to CoinDesk’s repeated requests to tour the facility – the only sounds to be heard were the soft whooshing of fans and bird calls.  Another major complaint from Taylor and activists like her is that the warm water Greenidge is putting back into Seneca Lake – the same process used by the facility since 1937 – is contributing to harmful algal blooms (HABs) on Seneca Lake. If true, that would be worrisome. HABs (essentially, explosions of algae) can be devastating to aquatic life.  This is a claim activists have repeated over and over and over again.  But here’s the rub: data shows that each of the Finger Lakes – not just Seneca Lake – has experienced HABs in recent years. There is not a power plant on any of the other lakes. The first reported cyanobacterial HAB on Seneca Lake was in 2015 – two years before the plant re-started and five years before it began mining bitcoin.  Furthermore, the State of New York commissioned a report on Seneca and Keuka lakes last August that found that phosphorus discharges are “considered the primary substance affecting water quality and the usability of the resource for both aquatic habitat and human uses.” Greenidge’s operation does not discharge phosphorus, a compound found in most fertilizers.  Bruce Murray has kept a fairly low profile in the debate. His winery, Boundary Breaks, sits on the east side of Seneca Lake and occupies 150 acres opposite Greenidge.  He told CoinDesk that in the last 25 years, there have been substantial changes in the aquatic condition of Seneca Lake. The salinity of the lake has risen (there are several salt mines in the area), the population of lake trout has decreased and invasive species of wildlife, like quagga mussels, have proliferated.  Activists have also repeatedly reiterated concerns that Greenidge’s intake pipes were responsible for sucking up fish, larvae and other aquatic critters and killing them. Greenidge spent $6 million constructing and installing wedge-wire fish screens in response to concerns.  CoinDesk tried to reach Taylor, calling and emailing several times to get Seneca Lake Guardian’s side of the story. When a reporter finally reached her by phone, Taylor was curt.  “We’re not interested in working with you, OK?” Taylor said, before hanging up.  ‘It’s very political’  The inaccuracy of local environmental groups’ claims bothers local supporters of Greenidge like Hall and Davis.  Davis told CoinDesk that most of his union members are locals whose families have lived in the area for generations, and many of them are avid hunters and fisherman.  “We’d be the first ones to step up and say ‘Hey, this is bad for the lake and we’re not interested in doing it anymore,’ but that’s just not the case,” Davis said. “Those algae blooms are on all the lakes, and there’s not power plants on all the lakes. Why are we not testing to find out why that is? Why are we just pointing the finger and saying it’s Greenidge?”  “[Kelles’s] region has been notoriously environmentally friendly,” Davis added. “She goes to her base, and that’s her base. It’s very political. It’s very divisive. And, unfortunately, most of the time, the information that’s out there is from a special interest group. But the real information, if you sit down and look at it, doesn’t add up.”  Griffin, too, expressed frustration with what he described as the “constant punching back-and-forth” between environmentalists and bitcoiners over Greenidge.  He speculated that the real issue for the anti-Greenidge camp was that bitcoin simply wasn’t relevant to their lives. When other data centers open up, Griffin said, there are ribbon cuttings.  Hall, the Dresden mayor, appeared to agree.  “There’s people that absolutely don’t understand it,” he said. “Someone’s told them the bad points, and you’ve got multiple people – we’ve got some here, locally – that it’s just jealousy. They didn’t get in on the ground floor, they’re not making any money, so no one else is gonna make any money. And there it is.”  Murray, the winery owner, told CoinDesk he understood the desire to make money and wasn’t opposed to energy usage in principle, but didn’t see the point of bitcoin.  “They can run thousands of mining machines there,” he said. “For what, is the question. For what?”  Grid issues  While bitcoin’s relevance may be debatable, the need for a consistent and reliable source of power is not. Meeting the state’s increasing energy demand, which is ballooning as more electric cars come online (electric vehicles are expected to gobble up 14% of New York’s total energy output by 2050), is not currently possible without fossil fuels.  The New York Independent System Operator (NYISO), which monitors the state’s power grid, said in its 2022 annual analysis that the grid is strained by the “deactivation of generation resources that provide critical reliability services to the grid.”  Griffin told CoinDesk that Greenidge is, first and foremost, a power generation plant.  “Their primary operating purpose is to generate power and send it to the grid when the grid needs it,” Griffin said. “Every day, power goes from that plant to the grid. Every single day.”  When the power isn’t needed, Griffin explained, Greenidge uses its excess capacity – which would otherwise be wasted – to power its bitcoin mining operation.  NYISO, the state’s independent entity which oversees its power generators, referred CoinDesk to its Gold Book annual report in response to a request for comment about how much electricity Greenidge provides to the state’s energy grid or what shuttering Greenidge might mean for it. A spokesperson told CoinDesk the entity did not have any data on how much of the energy generated goes to the grid, versus mining.  Before Greenidge began mining bitcoin, it sent an average of 186,878 megawatts (MW) of power to New York’s grid, according to data provided by a Greenidge spokesperson. After its bitcoin mining operation came online, the amount of power Greenidge was sending to the grid – excess power that was not consumed by bitcoin mining – was comparable, at a yearly average of 184,889 megawatts of power.  A review of Greenidge’s most recent quarterly filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission indicated it did indeed generate revenue from selling electricity to the NYISO, but only provided dollar figures and not the electricity mix itself. Bitcoin mining is more profitable than selling electricity to NYISO, based on these filings. According to both the filing and NYISO’s annual report, Greenidge reported a nameplate capacity of 106 MW per hour for 2022. That translates to an annual capacity of 928,560 MW, though Greenidge says it doesn't operate to that maximum capacity.  Davis, the IBEW director, told CoinDesk he’s sympathetic to desires to get away from natural gas as an electricity source.  “But right now, this is what your option is,” Davis said. “Because when your demand goes up, if the sun isn’t shining and the wind’s not blowing, you don’t have any power. You have to generate it somewhere.”  Real policy  Bitcoin mining has a real and tangible impact on the environment. That fact is not in question. In places where miners are tapping into an existing energy grid or source, they create demand that may not have been accounted for. In places where miners develop their own power generation facilities, they may drive greater use of fossil fuels.  Even miners who set up in locations with renewable energy sources could, again, lead to greater fossil fuel emissions if the renewable sources are insufficient to meet the new demand.  A Greenidge spokesperson declined to respond to specific questions about the company’s operations or impact on the local grid. In a statement attributed to Greenidge President Dale Irwin, the company said “the campaign run against Greenidge for years has been factually inaccurate and intentionally misleading. Those untruths masked as advocacy have unquestionably impacted policy decisions and it's unfortunate.”  “It truly didn’t become an issue until they started doing bitcoin mining. That was the trigger for when all of a sudden, all of the alarm came.”  The debate around bitcoin mining’s role in the U.S. ignores much of the nuance around these companies’ roles and conflates the different types of facilities. This wouldn’t be a problem, except these debates are driving real policies and policy outcomes in the U.S. without always hearing from those most directly affected, particularly in places like Dresden and other immediately adjacent villages like Torrey and Penn Yan.  “We’re direct beneficiaries of that plant,” Hall said. “The town of Torrey is a direct beneficiary. They get payment in lieu of taxes – the town, the county, the school district is a huge beneficiary. If the school district benefits from the tax money, it obviously benefits me and you as the homeowners.”  Griffin, of the development agency, said Greenidge generated $3 million in 2021 in the payments in lieu of taxes.  Though he acknowledged there are some residents who oppose the plant, Griffin said he knew “way more people” who supported Greenidge’s continued operation than who opposed it.  “In my day-to-day, I hear more positives about the plant operating than negatives. Far more,” Griffin said. “It truly didn’t become an issue until they started doing bitcoin mining. That was the trigger for when all of a sudden, all of the alarm came.”  He added: “We did it here, and it’s the end of the world. The opposition to this one, it’s confusing to me. And the only thing I can point to is that people are just not sure what bitcoin does for them.”  Nolen Hayes contributed reporting.

12873166,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=534670,1684861216,Here’s What The Metrics Say About Polygon’s (MATIC) Uptrend,"The price of Polygon (MATIC) and other notable crypto assets has been experiencing some volatility recently. The fluctuations present in the MATIC market can present traders and investors with profit-earning opportunities. Within the last seven days, the price has witnessed a significant increase of 3.25%, indicating strong momentum from the bulls. Analyzing The Polygon (MATIC) Bullish Momentum Polygon is the scaling solution for Ethereum and the network’s increasing adoption could increase its price as the demand grows over the long term. As of today, the price of Polygon (MATIC) is at $0.8861 in the last 24 hours, representing an increase of 1.64%. This price movement suggests a positive market sentiment and a growing demand for the asset. It also indicates that the bulls are in control of the market. Also, MATIC Dominance & Social sentiments are above 50%, indicating neutral pressure. Since both the market dominance and social sentiment are rising above 50%, it implies that MATIC has a positive sentiment among investors in the crypto market. The MATIC/USDT pair has formed a bullish flag pattern, suggesting a potential trend reversal and an end-to-downtrend movement. The breakout that occurred in the bullish flag pattern may be considered a confirmation of a trend reversal for traders and investors. As the asset trades between its support and resistance levels of $0.8399 & $0.9086, traders are watching these levels closely for possible breakouts. Related Reading: Shibarium Developers Say Each On-Chain Transaction Will Burn SHIB Tokens If MATIC breaks above the significant resistance level, it will trigger a bullish trend. The next support and resistance level will be at $0.5142 and 1.5799. However, if MATIC breaks below the $0.7536 support level, it could signal a bearish trend, and traders may look for selling opportunities. MATIC bears are currently trying to build momentum, but the bulls strongly hold their respective positions. This indicates a consolidation phase and a potential long-term uptrend if the bulls maintain this strong momentum. MATIC Technical Analysis Using Indicators The token has been on a downtrend since April 18, when the bears took control of the market. But recently, the asset has been showing signs of a potential trend reversal. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) trades above the signal line. This indicates a potential bullish trend in the market. Also, the histogram is above zero with strong green, confirming the bullish sentiment. Related Reading: Shiba Inu All Green Today – What’s The Energy Behind The Glow? Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) momentum oscillator has a reading of 42.35, suggesting neutral pressure from the bulls and bears. The market trades below the 50-Day and 200-Day Simple Moving Averages (SMA). This suggests a possible bearish movement. Nevertheless, the token bounced off a critical support level of $0.88 and may attempt to continue the bullish move.

42420359,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpVL3,1684857928,Binance Blasts 'Desperate' Reuters Report It Commingled Customer and Company Funds,"Binance is firing back at a Reuters special report from Tuesday that said the crypto exchange commingled customer funds with company revenue.  The report, citing unnamed ""former insiders,"" said the funds in question ""ran into billions of dollars"" and that ""commingling happened almost daily"" in accounts the exchange had at collapsed U.S. lender Silvergate Bank. It also said Reuters did not find evidence that clients' funds were ""lost or taken."" Reuters had previously reported that Binance had been able to access and transfer funds belonging to Binance.US in a Silvergate account, a claim neither Binance nor Binance.US refuted.  ""Commingling"" or the mixing of customer and company funds has become a bit of a dreaded buzz word in the crypto sphere since revelations following the fall of exchange giant FTX in November last year gave rise to concerns the practice may be widespread in the industry.  Binance itself has faced allegations of mixing funds when a Bloomberg report from January revealed the exchange had mistakenly kept collateral for certain crypto assets it issued in the same wallet as funds belonging to customers.  The fund flows Reuters described in Tuesday's report ""indicate a lack of internal controls to ensure customer funds were clearly identifiable and segregated from company revenues,"" according to three former U.S. regulators cited in the article, who also said the ""commingling"" obscured the whereabouts of customer funds.  But the exchange took aim at the Reuters report with Binance's Chief Communications Officer Patrick Hillmann calling it ""weak"" and full of ""conspiracy theories.""  ""Let me explain just how desperate a journalist @Reuters is to publish a negative story,"" Hillmann said before launching into a five-paragraph Twitter tirade following the publication of the article – which didn't outright deny the allegations made in the report.  Later, Hillmann wrote the exchange had addressed the issue ""on multiple occasions.""  ""We keep our user and corporate funds on completely separate ledgers... We know who their sources are and @Reuters will be embarrassed when it becomes public,"" Hillmann tweeted referring to the former insiders cited by the news outlet.  Hillmann also accused Reuters of ""xenophobia"" for mentioning Binance founder Changpeng Zhao's ethnicity ""without noting that he’s been Canadian since the age of 12.""  Following the publication of this article, Hillmann tweeted he ""very clearly refuted"" Reuters' claims in his initial response, adding the funds in question ""were Binance's corporate funds"" from the sale of BUSD stablecoins.  CoinDesk has reached out to Reuters for comment.

XRP stood out among the top 20 cryptocurrency assets, recording impressive weekly gains of over 8%. Although the daily chart displayed a relatively modest increase of more than 1%, it was enough to maintain the bullish momentum. The technical outlook for XRP revealed an improvement in buying strength, with demand and accumulation indicators reflecting a recovery on the daily chart. Related Reading: How Does Current Bitcoin Rally Compare With Historical Ones? However, the price movement of major altcoins remained uncertain as Bitcoin slipped back into the $26,000 price level. The future trajectory of XRP will depend on the performance of BTC in the upcoming trading sessions. Buyers will gain further strength if BTC exhibits improvement, leading to increased demand for XRP. Conversely, if demand fails to rise significantly, it could impede the growth of the XRP price. Another positive sign was the recovery of market capitalization, indicating increased demand and buying strength. XRP Price Analysis: One-Day Chart As of the time of writing, Ripple (XRP) was trading at $0.46. The altcoin demonstrated a significant breakthrough by surpassing the crucial resistance level of $0.44, increasing demand for the asset. Moving forward, the next obstacle for XRP lies at the overhead resistance of $0.48, which is expected to pose a tough challenge for the coin. However, if the altcoin manages to overcome this resistance level, it could potentially target the $0.50 mark. Conversely, a decline from the current price level would bring XRP down to $0.44, potentially even below the $0.42 price mark. The recent session witnessed a positive momentum for XRP, as indicated by the green volume bar of the altcoin traded. Technical Analysis Upon the price breakthrough above the $0.44 level, buyers swiftly entered the market, exhibiting a surge in demand for the altcoin. This heightened interest is further supported by the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which currently positions itself above the half-line, just below the 60-mark. This indicates that buying strength outweighs selling strength at the present moment, underlining the positive sentiment surrounding the altcoin. Furthermore, the asset’s price has risen above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, suggesting that buyers were driving the price momentum in the market. The increase in demand for the altcoin is reflected in the buy signals observed on the one-day chart for XRP. The Awesome Oscillator determines price direction and momentum. It generated small green signals closely tied to buy signals for the altcoin. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Struggles To Initiate A Breakout: Will It Defy Resistance And Rebound? This suggests a positive price action for the coin, highlighting the potential for further upward movement. Additionally, the Bollinger Bands, which measure price volatility and potential fluctuations, maintained a wide range. However, the parallel alignment of the bands indicates that the altcoin may trade within a relatively narrow range in the upcoming trading sessions.

42420362,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpVQD,1684857562,EU Banks Could Access Stablecoins More Easily Under Leaked Plans,"The European Commission wants to make it easier for commercial lenders to hold stablecoins and tokenized assets, after lawmakers pushed to discourage crypto holdings as part of a wider banking reform.  A leaked document seen by CoinDesk seeks to moderate the tough position taken by the European Parliament, which in January sought to anticipate global standards by saying banks should be required to issue one euro of capital for each euro of crypto they hold.  Lawmakers from the European Union (EU) have said they want to see the “prohibitive” restrictions to stop crypto turmoil from spilling over into the commercial banking system. Their plan includes giving crypto a 1,250% risk weight, implying a maximum possible capital requirement imposed on lenders who wish to hold digital assets.  The commission's proposal, undated but issued following an April 18 meeting among negotiators, is to bring that down to a 250% risk weight for any stablecoin whose value is tied to non-fiat assets such as gold.  Tokenized assets and stablecoins based on fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar would be treated the same as the underlying instrument, unless there’s an extra credit or market risk, the document added.  That’s in line with the bloc’s forthcoming Markets in Crypto Assets regulation, MiCA, set to take effect in July 2024, which will regulate stablecoin issuers and require them to hold appropriate reserves.  “Without a proper regulatory framework being in place to address the different types of risks faced by banks due to this new type of exposures, transmission channels between crypto-asset markets and financial markets might increase in type and size, leading to increased risks to financial stability and for individual banks,” said the commission document seen by CoinDesk.  Under the plan, supervisors would also need to check individual banks are correctly managing the risks of holding crypto such as cybersecurity, money laundering and valuation problems.  Other kinds of crypto such as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) would still have the maximum 1,250% risk weight, the document said – a degree of regulatory caution that has raised concerns from the traditional finance sector.  “The uncertainty and conservatism inhibits deal-making in the short term, much of which is to pilot, test and improve banks’ experience and understanding of this market in a controlled manner,” Sahir Akbar, managing director of prudential regulation at lobby group the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME), said of the commission's plans in a statement emailed to CoinDesk.  The document represents an improvement for tokenized assets and electronic money, added Akbar, citing areas that AFME had previously raised as a concern.  The proposals are intended to anticipate detailed crypto standards from the international Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which has already outlined a broadly similar plan. The commission said in the document that it will come up with a fuller, more permanent plan once the global standard setter has finalized its work after the end of 2023.  To pass into law, lawmakers have to hammer out an identical text with the EU’s member states, who meet in a body known as the Council, which has until now taken no formal position on the capital treatment of crypto. In practice, that takes place in a series of closed-door meetings among negotiators, mediated by the commission.  The document states that this is not a formal position of the commission, but it is likely to represent the view taken by officials during the talks. A spokesperson for the commission declined to comment on the leak.

42420363,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpVO9,1684857482,U.S. Is 'Losing' the Bitcoin Movement: Cathie Wood,"Cathie Wood, founder of investment manager ARK Invest, has said the U.S. is 'losing' the bitcoin movement owing to its regulatory system.  Speaking at Fortune's Most Powerful Next Gen conference last week, Wood described how the center of gravity of cryptocurrency is moving away from the U.S, using the example of crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) receiving licensing to operate in Bermuda while also looking to expand its presence in Singapore.  In the crypto world, ARK Invest is best known for its regular sizeable orders of COIN stock.  ""It would be nice if the U.S. were leading this movement, but we're losing it, and we're losing it because of our regulatory system,"" Wood said.  Frustration over the regulatory picture for crypto in the U.S. is largely directed at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over its insistence that the industry does not require any bespoke framework beyond existing securities laws, not to mention ongoing disputes with Coinbase and Ripple.  Cathie Wood also referenced last year's dramatic collapse of crypto exchange FTX, saying it ""proved the concept"" of bitcoin, as did this year's banking crisis in which Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate and Signature all went to the wall. Wood believes these crises underlined the dangers of centralization in financial systems, something to which bitcoin runs counter.  ""The reason it’s adopted is, first of all, many people like the idea of a decentralized, transparent, auditable monetary system.

42420349,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpV9h,1684857415,Sorare Carves Out Unique Entry Method for France Due to NFT Regulations,"Web3 fantasy sports company Sorare is introducing an alternate entry method for players based in France to abide by the country’s existing regulations, pending the implementation of a new regulatory framework surrounding in-game assets and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  Sorare has agreed to a temporary solution with the French National Gaming Authority (ANJ) that creates an optional alternative method of entry for players based in France. Sorare said in a blog post that the solution is short-term while they continue to develop their long-term roadmap amid ongoing regulatory discussions. The temporary solution is currently live for its flagship category Sorare: Football and will roll out for Sorare: MLB on May 26, 2023 and finally for Sorare: NBA in the fall.  The news comes after the French government announces plans for a bill that will more robustly regulate trading of in-game assets. However, the current framework does not support games such as Sorare, leading the company to find ways to abide by the rules in the meantime.  ""This development is part of Sorare’s roadmap to build an inclusive ecosystem uniting tens of millions of sports fans, and support its mission to bring these fans closer to the players, teams and leagues they love,"" a Sorare spokesperson told CoinDesk. ""It does not impact the structure of Sorare’s core game or competition, or its cards.”  While the new entry method will allow France-based players who don’t own NFTs to access Sorare tournaments, it comes with a set of restrictions. Players in France who choose to play with this alternative method need to have their phone number verified and to submit a proof of residence. After providing this, a team of randomly generated non-blockchain cards will be allocated to them and submitted into eligible competitions by Sorare. Users will not be able to simultaneously submit another team made up of NFT-based cards in the game week.  Sorare has previously faced pressures from French authorities to alter its rules due to gambling regulations within the country. In November, the French Gaming Authority released a statement asking for regulators to better analyze Web3 gaming, leading Sorare to open greater up free access to its game to appease the ANJ.

The token saw some relief as the U.S. debt-ceiling drama weighed on its price in recent days, rising 1.6% to $27.30K at 11:39 a.m. ET. Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) was also in the green, climbing 2.2% to $1.85K. Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission laid out new guidelines as part of the region's broader effort to become a crypto hub for the globe. Recall China banned crypto trading two years ago, and other countries, chiefly the U.S., have increasingly scrutinized the space after the collapse of crypto exchange FTX ( FTT-USD ). Under the new rules, the SFC will start accepting applications for virtual-asset platform licenses and enable such entities to provide services to retail investors, according to a report that detailed the conclusions of a consultation on retail participation. Licensed platforms should “comply with a range of robust investor protection measures covering onboarding, governance, disclosure and token due diligence and admission, before providing trading services to retail investors,” the SFC said in its conclusions.

The blacklisted wallets – which contained bitcoin, ether, Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC – belonged to an individual named Sang Man Kim, a 58-year-old North Korean citizen, OFAC alleged. The wallets were hosted by crypto exchange Binance.  That’s not to say Binance actively controlled the wallets – they appear to be automatically-generated wallet addresses hosted by the exchange that any user can sign up for. There have been no transactions to or from these addresses over the past year, according to blockchain data.  “The DPRK conducts malicious cyber activities and deploys information technology (IT) workers who fraudulently obtain employment to generate revenue, including in virtual currency, to support the Kim regime and its priorities, such as its unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs,” the OFAC press release said.  Binance had previously come under fire for allegedly facilitating bad actors’ efforts to circumvent sanctions. The exchange has since implemented stringent policies to purge North Korean actors from its platform, Binance Financial Crime Compliance Head Tigran Gambaryan told CoinDesk in April.  “We can confirm that Binance took action against accounts connected to these individuals over a year ago in compliance with lawfully served warrants,“ a spokesperson for Binance said in an email to CoinDesk. ""Binance has a policy of cooperation and compliance with all lawful information requests and legal inquiries from government, local regulatory, and law enforcement authorities pertaining to investigations, prosecutions, and forfeiture actions.”  North Korean-linked hackers have executed a number of sizable exploits in the digital assets industry.

12871453,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=534648,1684854026,Data Suggests Small Holders Will Drive Next Cardano (ADA) Rally,"Over the course of 2023, the movement of Cardano (ADA) has been more on the bullish side. Despite the reversal over the last few weeks, the bullish momentum has not completely died out. However, what is most interesting about this trend is the fact that the smaller investors seem to be the major driver behind it, not the large whales. Cardano Small Investors Continue To Accumulate Through the course of 2023, the smaller Cardano investors have been at the forefront of the ADA accumulation. This is seen from January through to May where their collective holdings have continued to rise. These investors holding between 1,000-10,000 coins and 10,000-100,000 coins have steadily grown their holdings over the last six months. Related Reading: Meme Coin Season May Be Over As PEPE, SHIB, DOGE, Continue Decline Where the whales were skewed toward selling than buying, these retail investors were heavily on the buy side. As a result, their collective holdings have grown from around 17% of the total supply to over 18.1%. As a result, these smaller wallets holding between 1,000-100,000 coins now account for 6.29 billion out of the 34.79 billion total supply. Their accumulation trend also coincides with the rise in the price of ADA over this time which is illustrated in the chart below. There were dips in their holdings where there was presumably some profit-taking. However, the general trend continued toward the upside, bringing their holdings to new highs. Small ADA holders increase holdings in six months | Source: Santiment During this time, the holdings of larger investors holding between 10,000,000-100,000,000 coins dropped drastically. This suggests that while the smaller holders were responsible for the price increase, larger holders were the culprits behind the price crash as their total holdings went from 12.1% of the total supply to 11.11% in April. What Will Trigger The Next ADA Rally? Currently, the price of ADA is still down, suggesting that investors are very wary about buying the token. However, if the accumulation trend among smaller wallets continues, there could be more upside to come. An added advantage of small wallets leading the accumulation trend is that it enables a broader distribution of the token, which helps to sustain bull rallies. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Falls Below Critical Support, Is It Time For You To Buy?

42420386,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpXpt,1684852080,Bitcoin Jumps to Key Price Resistance as Hong Kong Opens Crypto Trading for Retail Investors,"Bitcoin (BTC) rose to key price resistance early Tuesday as Hong Kong said retail investors could trade digital assets from June 1.  Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) announced that it would accept applications from exchanges to offer crypto trading to retail investors from June 1, adding that approved tokens need a 12-month track record and substantial market capitalization. The SFC said registered exchanges would be barred from providing stablecoin and interest-bearing instruments.  The announcement is consistent with long-held expectations that developments in Asia will catalyze the next crypto bull run and contrasts the lack of regularity in the West, particularly in the U.S.  Bitcoin picked up a bid during the Asian hours and rose more than 2% to $27,500, probing the former support-turned-resistance of the horizontal trendline connecting the first and second trough of the head-and-shoulders (H&S) pattern. The cryptocurrency fell below the trendline early this month, confirming the H&S breakdown and opening doors for a deeper slide toward $25,000.  ""This looks like a non-macro-related spot-based move, and the timing coincides with the news that Hong Kong will allow retail trading of BTC and ETH on licensed digital asset platforms as of June 1,"" Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, said in Tuesday's edition. ""This is not a total surprise – the ruling and the timing were largely expected. But confirmation matters more in a lacklustre market with headwinds coming from other vectors,"" Acheson added.  Per Acheson, Hong Kong's decision to green light crypto trading for retail investors does not mean there will be a flood of demand for cryptocurrencies, as local traders are probably already accessing the market through offshore venues. Nevertheless, the announcement is a ""a welcome reminder that the crypto adoption pool is likely to grow considerably over the next year and beyond,"" Acheson noted.  Bitcoin needs to clear the H&S trendline resistance and the 20-day simple moving average at $27,500 to confirm a bull revival, according to Canada-based digital assets liquidity provider Secure Digital Markets.  ""As long as prices remain below the neckline [horizontal trendline] of this [H&S] pattern as well as the 20-day moving average, we should expect further downside to $25,250 and posibly $24,000,"" wrote the analysts there.  Bitcoin's short-term outlook also depends on the ongoing U.S. debt ceiling drama and the dollar index's trajectory. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned that the government would run out of money in early June if a debt deal is not reached, opening doors for what many say would be a catastrophic default. Some analysts said a successful resolution of the debt ceiling drama might see the Treasury suck out liquidity from the market and put downward pressure on bitcoin.  Lastly, bond yields are rising in a sign of investors reassessing the possibility of the Federal Reserve continuing its rate hike campaign and keeping borrowing costs higher for longer.  The U.S. 10-year yield rose to more than a two-month high of 3.75% at press time, while the two-year jumped to 4.4%, the highest since March 13. Rising yields dent the appeal of risk assets like technology stocks and cryptocurrencies and zero-yielding assets like gold.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/23/bitcoin-jumps-to-key-price-resistance-as-hong-kong-opens-crypto-trading-for-retail-investors,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a00d696f4038b77a5a2e6dc639c19f5829dc620d-1620x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

12870667,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=534634,1684850453,Avalanche (AVAX) Trading Volume Skyrockets Amid Sustained Price Growth,"Avalanche (AVAX) is gaining today as it seeks to retain its gains in the last 24 hours. Its trading volume is up by over 18% today, possibly sustaining its price recovery attempt. Notably, AVAX entered the month of May with a bullish momentum trading at $16.66 on May 1, 2023. However, the bears have kept AVAX’s price at $14 since May 18. It now approaches the $15 price level seeking to rediscover its positive price form. The increased trading volume today implies that more activities are ongoing on the network. This surging interest in the network might help AVAX sustain its uptrend. A return to $21 remains likely for the asset in the long term. AVAX Price Moves AVAX is gaining today, forming a higher high on the daily chart. The bulls are intent on mounting a recovery rally. However, the bears are still active in the market. Related Reading: How Does Current Bitcoin Rally Compare With Historical Ones? Since AVAX still trades below its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), the asset will likely see a further price decline in the short and long term. The SMA’s display sell signals prompting traders to take short positions in the market today. However, some indicators are pointing to a price recovery for AVAX soon. For instance, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 38.53 and close to the oversold region. The RSI indicator mirrors the bearish trend that began on May 18, 2023, but the indicator is moving upwards, hinting at a potential trend reversal for the asset. Although the AVAX’s Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is just breaking above its signal line and showing convergence, its histogram bars display small green bars hinting at a potential trend reversal to the upside. A close look at the chart structure shows that AVAX entered a downtrend on April 19, 2023. But it found support on May 22, sparking hope for a price recovery. What’s Ahead For Avalanche? AVAX has found valuable support at the $14.29 price level, a pivot point for the asset. It is currently trading above its closest resistance level of $14.29. However, the bears are still active in the market, intent on keeping it below the next resistance level of $15.21. From historical price behavior, AVAX pivoted on the $14.29 support on March 11, 2023, rallying to $21.29 on April 18, with dips in between. It replayed the same action on May 22 and will likely rally again to the $21 price level in the longer time frame.

42420369,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpXaP,1684850400,Crypto Wallet Provider Ledger Delays Key-Recovery Service After Uproar,"Following harsh criticism from the crypto community, hardware wallet provider Ledger will delay releasing a key recovery feature.  In a letter to users, Ledger CEO Pascal Gauthier wrote that the firm won’t introduce the new feature before releasing the code for it. The company also scheduled a Twitter Spaces session for 12:30 p.m. EST on Tuesday to discuss the issue.  Last week, Ledger announced the service, called Ledger Recover, which will allow users to store encrypted backups of their seed phrases with a set of three custodians. Ledger owners will then be able to restore their private keys even if they lose or forget their seed phrases. The opt-in feature will require a know-your-customer (KYC) verification.  Ledger came under fire almost immediately from members of the cryptocurrency community, which criticized the idea of sharing seed phrases with anyone other than wallet owners. Multiple commentators wrote angry posts on Twitter, Reddit and other platforms, saying they felt betrayed by Ledger, which has previously said that Ledger wallet private keys would never leave a device.  Some critics also highlighted potential threats such as hacks of the custodians, data leaks from KYC providers and law enforcement taking control of Ledger users’ data. Others noted that the code for the Recover feature is not open-source, so there is no way to audit the safety of the proposed custody mechanism.  Unlike some competitors, Ledger does not publish all its code, but instead has its product tested by a team of selected security researchers.  Read more: Is Ledger’s New Bitcoin Key Recovery Feature Safe? Experts Have Doubts  The company learned a hard lesson, Gauthier said in his letter to users. Parts of the Ledger code have been open-sourced before, and more will follow soon, Gauthier said.  “We have made the decision to accelerate the open sourcing roadmap! We will include as much of the Ledger operating system as possible, starting with core components of the OS, and Ledger Recover, which won’t be released until this work is complete,” he wrote.  Gauthier also reiterated the idea that offering key recovery services is essential to onboard a new wave of crypto users, for which self-custody might feel too difficult.  “The majority of users in crypto today either don’t own their private keys and/or are putting their private keys at risk using less secure forms of self-custody, and hard-to-use forms of storing and securing their seed phrase,” the letter reads.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | REGULATION | WALLET,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/05/23/crypto-wallet-provider-ledger-postpones-release-of-key-recovery-service-after-public-criticism,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1832991e5486da4173136df93a81ff415ce9340b-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42420387,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpXqv,1684850400,"Multicoin Leads $2.3M FastLane VC Deal, Continuing Its Bet on MEV Infrastructure","Crypto-focused investment firm Multicoin Capital has led a $2.3 million seed funding round for FastLane Labs, a maximal extractable value (MEV) protocol for Polygon. The fundraise marks Multicoin’s third time backing infrastructure for MEV, a controversial way for validators to earn more money while ordering transactions into the blocks on a blockchain.  MEV is a way for miners or validators to profit from how a pending blockchain transaction is ordered or arranged before the transaction becomes a block. The method of earning MEV varies a bit depending on the chain, but it’s common for traders to focus on a high volume of attempts or spamming to maximize the profit potential.  Founded in March 2022, FastLane Labs provides an auction system that allows validators a chance to earn rewards without the need to spam the blockchain. Polygon validators earn their tips in the native MATIC token from traders who are competing for specific positions in the blocks. The auctions happen off-chain and externally to minimize redundant transactions on the network. FastLane stands apart from other Polygon MEV protocols by allowing validators to use their current Polygon clients to participate rather than downloading a new proprietary client, FastLane co-founder and CEO Alex Watts said in an interview with CoinDesk  Read more: What Is MEV, aka Maximal Extractable Value?  “We actually didn't originally intend to raise capital,"" said Watts. ""We were planning to sort of bootstrap the whole way ... Then we were approached by Multicoin Capital, and they actually pitched us a few ideas that we thought were really fascinating,"" he continued. ""We realized that by working with them, and by raising capital, we could actually become much larger than we had originally been planning.”  The talks with Multicoin started in late August of last year, when FastLane didn’t have a corporation or even a pitch deck to show investors, Watts said. The long fundraise period gave the FastLane legal team time to get the infrastructure in place. Other participants in the round included Polygon Ventures, Shima Capital, Delphi Ventures and Everstake Ventures, a41 Ventures and Symbolic Capital, the venture capital fund from Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal.  Multicoin Capital made its first MEV-related investment in Sept. 2021 leading the $17.4 million round for Eden Network, multi-chain infrastructure for reducing the negative impacts of MEV on a network. The firm then co-led a $10 million round last August for Jito Labs, an infrastructure provider focused on Solana-based MEV.  “As DeFi on Polygon continues to blossom we expect more MEV opportunities to emerge,"" said Shayon Sengupta, investment partner at Multicoin Capital, in a statement. ""Polygon FastLane today represents the best way to get exposure to DeFi activity within the Polygon ecosystem ... MEV protocols do more than create additional revenue streams for validators; they are now critical infrastructure that helps maintain the stability and usability of any given network.”  Update (UTC 16:30): Update corrects the third paragraph to note that traders can spam a network, not validators.",POSITIVE,MATIC,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MATIC | REGULATION,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/05/23/multicoin-leads-23m-fastlane-vc-deal-continuing-its-bet-on-mev-infrastructure,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8fad999e564e82e969508b31831199105dbb3c8f-5184x3888.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Other participants in the funding round included North Island Ventures, Seed Club Ventures, ID Theory, Road Capital, Curve Labs, gmjp.lol, Molecule, Gnosis DAO, The LAO, Orange DAO, Beaker DAO, Spaceship DAO, and former Coinbase chief technology officer Balaji Srinivasan, among others.  The fundraise announcement coincided with the launch of the PLEX software platform.  PLEX is the client that lets scientists interact with the Lab exchange. The service is launching with the ability to run only computational services, while physical laboratory services will be added in the future. LabDAO has containerized resource-intensive computational services to make it easier to run data.  The output can then be linked to non-fungible tokens (NFT) for scientists to prove ownership of their data.  “Over the last couple of years, artists were able to go directly into the NFT movement. They were able to create artwork and share that with their followers. Scientists are also creators – you could say to some extent that scientists are the original creator class. They should also be able to create artwork and share that with their followers,” Niklas Rindtorff, co-founder and CEO of the Openlab Association, said during an interview with CoinDesk.  “The problem though is that science is a bit more complex. Science is a team sport – very rarely do you have one scientist that’s able to take a project all the way through to completion on their own and create something new,” he continued. “That means you need to find mechanisms to collaborate as a scientist. What we identified early is a need for an exchange where scientists can trade laboratory and computation services.”  Openlab is a Swiss-based non-profit set up by the LabDAO team.  The decentralized autonomous organization structure of LabDAO isn’t fully in place yet. LabDAO is currently focused on building out the exchange and making sure it creates utility for scientists both inside and outside of academia, said Rindtorff. LabDAO wants to have the exchange in place so that when the DAO and affiliated token are ready, there’s something to govern and an active community.  Decentralized science (DeSci) is a small but growing sector in the crypto industry that has attracted a wide range of investors.

When investors send tokens to an exchange, it often suggests they plan to sell. Representatives for Sun didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.  Blockchain data by Arkham Intelligence show that a wallet linked to Justin Sun sent 6,802 MKR tokens to a Binance account through an intermediary wallet.  The spot market of MKR is thin and illiquid, meaning that a large sell order can significantly move the token price. A sell order for 525 MKR on the MKR/USDT pair on Binance, the most liquid market for the token, may cause a 2% price decline, according to Cryptowatch data.  MKR is the governance token of MakerDAO, one of the largest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and issuer of the $4.7 billion DAI stablecoin. The token has been changing hands at around $632 at press time, per CoinDesk data.  Sun’s transfer comes as MakerDAO undergoes a major overhaul of its governance structure – a process called Endgame. The restructuring, spearheaded by protocol founder Rune Christensen, involves breaking up the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) into smaller, self-governing entities called SubDAOs issuing their own tokens, upgrading and renaming its DAI stablecoin and MKR governance token and increasingly investing its vast reserves into real-world assets.  The Endgame plan, while approved by governance vote, also sparked backlash among the community members and investors in the protocol. A slew of delegates and developers have resigned from their roles through the past months. In March, crypto investing giant Paradigm Capital, one of the largest investors in the protocol, unloaded roughly $20 million of MKR, blockchain data by Arkham showed, with the tokens ending up on a Coinbase deposit address.",NEGATIVE,MKR,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MKR | BNB,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/23/justin-sun-moves-43m-of-makerdaos-tokens-to-binance-blockchain-data,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b338d7c93e4c1ac94e1eb6774d0b8c7a752e43d2-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to data from the Shiba Inu burn tracker, Shibburn, the Shiba Inu burn rate is currently up by 2,372% in the past 24 hours due to the burn from one single wallet. The burn has not only surged the SHIB burn rate but can also be attributed to the current spike in Shiba Inu which is up by more than 2% in the last 24 hours. Shiba Inu Burn Rate Surges According to data from Shibburn, over the past 24 hours, the Shiba Inu community has transferred roughly 1.24 billion SHIB to a designated “dead wallet,” forever removing these tokens from circulation. A single wallet burned approximately 1.23 billion SHIB tokens in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Shiba Inu All Green Today – What’s The Energy Behind The Glow?

Executed approximately 12 hours ago, this colossal burn event has now propelled Blaze Token’s number of burned SHIB to about 7.9 billion in total. While the recent burn event might have triggered a portion of excitement in the SHIB community, it is worth noting that more is still to come especially with the launch of the Shibarium. Shibarium is an underlying blockchain technology that plays a crucial role in facilitating the burn mechanism of Shiba Inu. According to the blockchain developers in a recent series of tweets, each transaction on the Shibarium network would result in a burn of the Shiba Inu (SHIB) token. SHIB Records Upward Momentum Following the significant burn, the SHIB token price has picked up an upward momentum in the past 24 hours. Over this period, SHIB has surged by more than 2%. The meme coin currently trades at $0.00000905 up from a low of $0.00000885 on Monday. SHIB’s market capitalization has also recorded a slight surge. Over the past 24 hours, more than $100 million has been added to SHIB’s market cap bringing the token total cap to roughly $5.3 billion while still ranking 16th among the largest cryptocurrency by market cap.

The meme coin’s 24-hour trading volume currently stands at $156 million, a drop from the volume high of $186 million seen earlier this morning. The price uptick from SHIB suggests that the market has responded favorably to the reduction in circulating supply. As supply decreases, the scarcity of SHIB tokens may contribute to increased demand and potential price appreciation in the long run.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Interest in staking ether, i.e., locking coins in the Ethereum network to earn passive yield, has surged since implementation of the Shapella, or Shanghai upgrade on April 12. Data tracked by Glassnode shows more than 4.4 million coins have been deposited into the staking contract since April 12, taking the total amount of staked tokens to 22.58 million. ""The surge in demand for staking probably originates from large ether holders, who prefer not to liquidate their holdings and instead seek to generate passive income,"" analysts at Bitfinex said in a weekly report shared with CoinDesk Tuesday.  Cryptocurrency exchange OKX is targeting France as a regional hub in Europe with plans to hire around 100 people there in the next three years. The Seychelles-based firm has filed an application to become registered as a Digital Asset Service Provider (DASP), looking to join 74 other companies that have so far won regulatory approval from that country's Financial Markets Authority. It plans to establish a ""substantial"" physical presence in France, said Tun Byun, the company's head of global government relations. France last year emerged as the destination of choice for Binance as a European Union hub following its DASP registration.  MicroStrategy (MSTR) represents an attractive alternative to Coinbase (COIN) for investors looking to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency sector, German investment bank Berenberg said in a report Monday. Investors who are very bearish on Coinbase shares and are inclined to short the stock should look at pairing it with a long position in MicroStrategy, the report said, noting that the correlation between the two stocks since Coinbase went public via a direct listing in April 2021 is 0.96. Berenberg says macro drivers of demand for bitcoin are bullish for MicroStrategy shares, and investor concerns over de-dollarization - or the weakening of the U.S. dollar’s dominance - have helped to put a more positive spotlight on bitcoin in recent months.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the market-implied probabilities for the benchmark U.S. interest rate over the coming months.  Investors do not foresee a notable decline in the interest rate anytime soon as policymakers continue to discount recession talks and favor a higher for longer stance.  Per crypto asset management firm Blofin, the low probability of rate cuts means the crypto market may remain under pressure and the situation may improve at the end of the year.

Both 30-Day & 365-Day Litecoin MVRV Ratios Are High Currently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, LTC traders are well above water at the moment. The “MVRV ratio” is an indicator that measures the ratio between the two main capitalization models for Litecoin: the market cap and the realized cap. The market cap here is the usual cap that calculates the total value of the asset by simply taking the value of each coin in the circulating supply the same as the current spot price. The realized cap, however, is a more special model as it assumes that the actual value of any coin in circulation is the price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain. Since this model aims to estimate a sort of “true value” for Litecoin, its comparison with the market cap (that is, the spot price) in the MVRV can tell us whether the asset’s price is fair or not right now. When the MVRV has a value greater than 1, it means the market cap is above the realized cap currently. During such times, the average investor is in a state of profit, so the incentive to sell for them increases. As such, the cryptocurrency could be considered overpriced in these conditions. Related Reading: How Does Current Bitcoin Rally Compare With Historical Ones? On the other hand, the indicator having a value lower than this threshold implies the average holder is in a loss, and hence, the asset may be undervalued currently. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 30-day and 365-day moving averages (MAs) of the Litecoin MVRV ratio over the last few months: Looks like the values of the metrics have been high in recent days | Source: Santiment As displayed in the above graph, both the 30-day and 365-day MAs of Litecoin MVRV have risen above the baseline with the recent surge in the price beyond the $90 level. This may mean that the cryptocurrency could have become slightly overpriced. Prior to this surge, when LTC had been visiting some lows, the 30-day version of the indicator had temporarily entered into the undervalued region. Coinciding with these values of the metric, the price formed its bottom and eventually built up towards the current surge. Related Reading: Former MicroStrategy CEO Says Bitcoin Rally Just Getting Started Back in April, the MVRV MAs showed a similar behavior as right now, as they touched relatively high values when the asset had rallied above the $100 mark. The rally stopped before long in those overvalued conditions, and the asset took a plunge. If a similar pattern as back then also follows with the current overpriced values of the indicator, then Litecoin may go on to observe a correction in the near future. In the long term, however, the outlook of the asset could still remain bullish, as the much-awaited halving event, where the cryptocurrency’s block rewards will be permanently cut in half, will take place in August, which is just around the corner now.

The original bill, currently being finalized in the wake of allegations made against an opposition party politician, had been scheduled for implementation in December but, in remarks to reporters, Yun Jae-ok said it should be amended to bring forward the enforcement date to within one or two months from now.  ""Given the current high level of public interest, especially regarding lawmakers, it's not appropriate to enforce the law six months later after the promulgation,"" Yun said, according to the report. Yun reportedly said he had asked the leader of the Public Administration Committee to propose a modified version of the law, on which a vote is scheduled for Friday.  Earlier this month, independent lawmaker Rep. Kim Nam-kuk, previously with the opposition Democratic Party of Korea, was reported to local prosecutors by South Korea's financial watchdog for a series of crypto transactions deemed suspicious. Kim, who had previously co-sponsored a provision to defer taxation on virtual digital assets, said he did not cash out his tokens and did not violate any laws.  Yun also alleged that Kim cashed 250 million won ($189,942) worth of coins in February and March last year, a far larger amount than the 4.4 million won ($3,342) that Kim had earlier said he cashed at the time, the report said.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has characterized most crypto tokens as unregistered securities, rendering them, and the platforms that enable the trading of these digital assets, as vulnerable to further regulatory actions, the note said. The commission and other regulators have been clear in classifying bitcoin (BTC) as a commodity rather than a security, the note added.  “We believe MicroStrategy, which features a unique business model focused on the acquisition and holding of bitcoins, represents an attractive alternative to Coinbase in the current environment,” analysts Mark Palmer and Hassan Saleem wrote.  Microstrategy currently holds 140,000 BTC worth around $3.8 billion at current prices.  Berenberg says macro drivers of demand for bitcoin are bullish for MicroStrategy shares, and investor concerns over de-dollarization - or the weakening of the U.S. dollar’s dominance - have helped to put a more positive spotlight on bitcoin in recent months.  Recent comments from SEC Commissioner Gary Gensler regarding Coinbase leave little doubt as to his view of the company’s noncompliance with securities laws and management’s “defiant tone” regarding the scrutiny it has received will potentially serve as an accelerant of the filing of any enforcement action, the analysts wrote.  “Coinbase’s revenues at risk in the event of an enforcement action are disproportionately profitable relative to its total revenue,” the report added.  The bank has a hold rating on Coinbase shares with a price target of $55. MicroStrategy is buy-rated with a $340 price target.

42420383,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpXor,1684837203,Hong Kong Securities Regulator to Accept License Applications for Crypto Exchanges Starting June 1,"Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) will begin accepting applications for crypto trading platform licenses on June 1, according to a Tuesday announcement.  The regulator has agreed to allow licensed virtual asset providers to serve retail investors, provided that operators assess understanding of the risks involved, according to a report on its consultation on policy recommendations released Tuesday. The SFC opened its initial policy recommendations to public feedback in February.  The regulator also proposed stablecoins, which are crypto pegged to the value of other assets, ""should not be admitted for retail trading"" until the jurisdiction's planned regulations for the asset class kick in.  The rulebook explicitly bans crypto ""gifts,"" designed to incentivize retail customers to invest – which likely includes airdrops.  The guidelines, some of which were changed based on public feedback, place the onus squarely on platform operators to conduct due diligence, stressing that being included in two acceptable indices is just the minimum criterion for being listed for trading.  Under the rules, crypto exchanges are to maintain at all times no less than 5,000,000 Hong Kong dollars ($640,00) in capital, and at the end of each month, submit the platform's available and required liquid capital, a summary of bank loans, advances, credit facilities as well as a profit and loss analysis to the SFC. Approved tokens on regulated exchanges need a 12 month ""track record,"" according to the rules.  The document also provides more detail on allowing retail investors to use trading platforms and on conducting due diligence on token listing. All tokens listed on exchanges will need to go through due diligence procedures before being listed on exchanges even if they are already listed on another platform. They will have to go through smart contract audits by independent assessors. Platform operators will not need to appoint independent external members to token review committees so long as they adequately deal with conflicts of interests, according to the conclusions.  The SFC will allow platforms to segregate client and its own assets through an escrow arrangement or via the licensed platform setting funds aside. Client virtual assets should be fully covered by each platform's compensation arrangement.  In response to suggestions that third-party custodians could be engaged to safe-keep client assets, the SFC replied that since there is no regulatory regime for custodians of virtual assets, allowing that would hinder their supervision and enforcement.  The SFC said it will consult a separate review on allowing derivatives, which it acknowledges are very important to institutional investors.  On implementing the Financial Action Task Force's (FATF) travel rule for sharing information on crypto transactions between financial institutions, the SFC said that when required information cannot be submitted to the beneficiary institution right away, it will accept submission as soon as practicable after the virtual asset transfer until January 1, 2024.  The guidelines also include clarifications on anti-money laundering requirements and criteria for fining platforms for breaching them.  The revised guidelines come into force on June 1.

Such a development would introduce a new level of uncertainty and potentially dampen investor sentiment. However, recent price movements have shown some encouraging signs for SHIB enthusiasts. On May 8, the SHIB price experienced a rebound precisely at the support line of the triangle, marking the first time this level had been reached since the beginning of the year.

Binance Is Not Liable In a ruling on May 22, Judge Amos dismissed the lawsuit that Gadasalli had brought forward in which she claimed that Binance aided the scammer steal $8 million in a scheme hatched on Tinder, a dating app. Binance filed for the case to be dismissed at the United States Easter District Court of Texas, saying the plaintiff had failed to state a claim. Moreover, Binance lawyers say there was a lack of personal jurisdiction and this request was made in June 2022. Related Reading: Ripple CTO Labels BEN Coin As Scam, Bitboy Reacts The ruling on May 22, Judge Amos said, complied with Federal rules that require a court to dismiss a claim should there be no personal jurisdiction over the defendant, in this case, Binance. In law, personal jurisdiction empowers the court to hear a case, regardless of the subject matter. And afterward, they can make a ruling. Despite Binance’s position that there is no personal jurisdiction, Gadasalli’s lawyers wanted the court to investigate the relationship between Binance and Binance US. Court filings show that Gadasalli had been scammed off $8 million after being “promised romance and financial prosperity” in a pig butchering scam. In a pig butchering scam, the victim engages in a well-orchestrated fraud where romance is used as bait for active investment in non-existent cryptocurrency schemes. Court data shows that the fraudulent scheme was devised by three defendants, Jerry Bulasa, Dong Lian, and Danyun Lin. Gadasalli met Bulasa on Tinder and believed she had struck a romantic connection. Eventually, the victim ended up “investing in the direction of Bulasa,” whom she thought was a “successful cryptocurrency investor.” Bulasa later informed Gadasalli that their crypto investment stood at $10 million, but she couldn’t withdraw any assets. This frustration and realization that she was down $8 million made her file a lawsuit against Bulasa and Binance. Lawsuits And Investigations, BNB Firm Binance has been a target of United States regulators in recent months. In March, the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) sued the exchange for allegedly operating a derivatives trading platform without registration, violating existing trading laws.

The bank says conversations with clients suggest that hedge funds are returning to token trading, “with momentum strategies likely benefitting to some extent from heightened volatility due to declining trading volumes.”  Momentum investing is when investors buy assets that are rising and sell them when they appear to have peaked, using volatility to identify buying opportunities in short-term uptrends and then selling when momentum appears to be waning.  Bank of America says it expects cryptocurrency trading volumes to remain subdued, with retail investors remaining on the sidelines.

And Michael Saylor, the former CEO of MicroStrategy, believes the cryptocurrency market is bottoming, and a Bitcoin rally is on the horizon. Regulation, Halving, And Ordinals Are Drivers In the interview, Saylor points out several tailwinds that may drive BTC to new 2023 highs. Specifically, he talks about regulations and how BTC is safe, considering the favorable classification from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), two of the top regulators in the country. Their officials classify Bitcoin as a commodity with utility and not an unregistered security. Saylor opines that other assets besides Bitcoin have a “black cloud hanging” over them and could be “regulated out of existence.” Consequently, he continued, capital will most likely flow from altcoins to BTC. I think the crypto tokens and securities will be regulated, perhaps out of existence. Bitcoin is the most secure network. It’s the most secure asset. Everything else has got a black cloud hanging over it. You will see a consistent flow of capital from the rest of the crypto ecosystem into Bitcoin. Related Reading: Prominent Crypto Trader Drops Shocking Bitcoin Price Prediction Besides regulation, he thinks the upcoming BTC halving event could propel prices higher. In 2024, the Bitcoin network will halve miner rewards from the current 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. This development will be a supply shock on the network, making BTC scarcer and more valuable. Though miner revenue might drop, past halving events have led to significant price gains. This pattern may be replicated next year. Even though Ordinals has been blamed for bloating the network, Saylor remains bullish about the service and that it will propel the digital asset toward new highs. Ordinals is a platform allowing users to attach files, such as texts and videos, to Satoshis, effectively storing them on-chain. A satoshi is the smallest unit of BTC. Bitcoin Bull Run Incoming Talking to CNBC, Saylor, a Bitcoin permabull, thinks the recent firmness of the coin could be the start of a bull run that could push it to new 2023 highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price At Key Juncture, What Could Trigger Strong Increase BTC has been consolidating, failing to convincingly close above the $28,000 resistance level. For the better part of May 2023, prices have been edging lower, moving from around the $31,000 level recorded in late April 2023. Since April, the coin has dropped by around 10%, falling to as low as $25,800 last week. Despite the recent contraction, Bitcoin remains within a bullish formation. Notably, bears have failed to reverse gains posted from mid-March to early April 2023.

42420372,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpXcT,1684829280,Number of Ether Staked Has Surged by 4.4 Million Since Shapella Upgrade,"Interest in staking ether (ETH), or locking coins in the Ethereum network to earn passive yield, has surged since Ethereum implemented the Shapella or Shanghai upgrade on April 12.  Data tracked by Glassnode show more than 4.4 million coins have been deposited into the staking contract since April 12, taking the tally to 22.58 million.  ""The surge in demand for staking probably originates from large Ether holders, who prefer not to liquidate their holdings and instead seek to generate passive income,"" analysts at Bitfinex said in a weekly report shared with CoinDesk Tuesday.  ""This trend is anticipated to persist, particularly considering that deflationary forces are expected to propel the price of Ether significantly,"" analysts added.  The staking demand has surged despite a waiting time of over one month, as previously reported. As of Tuesday, ether holders looking to become a validator on the network would have to wait for 36 days, according to data source wenmerge.com.  Currently, more than 50,000 perspective validators are in the queue. At press time, staking ether offers an annualized yield of 4% to 5%.  Validators are entities tasked with processing transactions and storing data on the blockchain and need to deposit at least 32 ETH.  Ether owners continue to establish themselves as network validators, enticed by an annual yield of around 4-5 percent through token staking.  Shapella de-risked staking  Staking, as a way of passive investing, began gathering traction after Ethereum's Beacon Chain went live in December 2020. But for three years, stakers were unable to withdraw locked coins at will, which exposed them to ether price gyrations.  The Shapella upgrade de-risked staking, allowing users to unlock their coins at will.  The recently enabled withdrawal flexibility in ETH staking, courtesy of the Shapella upgrade, mitigates its perceived risk for many investors,"" Bitfinex's analysts noted.

42420370,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpXbR,1684826742,International Securities Regulator IOSCO Proposes Policy Recommendations for Crypto,"The International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) opened up its policy recommendations for crypto and digital asset markets for public comment on Tuesday.  The 18 policy recommendations cover a range of issues such as market abuse, conflict of interest, client asset protection, disclosures and risks associated with crypto. The proposed recommendations mainly address ""widespread concerns regarding investor protection and market integrity"" within crypto markets, a statement to the press said.  Last year, the international policy forum that groups securities regulators in around 130 countries established a Fintech Task Force (FTF) to develop IOSCO’s regulatory agenda for both fintech and crypto. The FTF, chaired by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, is made up of 27 of 33 board member jurisdictions.  One of two working groups attached to the FTF, run by the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority, was set to publish recommendations for crypto assets this year, while another run by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) worked on decentralized finance (DeFi).  Global standard-setters have renewed their call for tougher crypto regulations following the collapse of stablecoin issuer Terra and crypto exchange FTX last year. The Financial Stability Board is set to publish recommendations for stablecoins later this year and coming global crypto rules will be based on a joint FSB and International Monetary Fund (IMF) synthesis paper.  International financial crimes watchdog FATF last week called on the Group of Seven (G-7) advanced economies to lead in implementing its recommended norms for preventing money laundering.  “As the G-7 Finance Ministers and Central Bank communiqué of 13 May has once again reminded us, the time has come to put an end to the regulatory uncertainty that characterizes crypto activities. Today’s consultation paper received unanimous support from the IOSCO Board and is the outcome of an intense period of regulatory risk analysis, information sharing and capacity building,"" Jean-Paul Servais, chairperson of IOSCO, said in a statement to the press.  Of the recommendations, the ones concerning conflict of interest and safety of client assets are the least surprising but may be most important, Servais said at a press briefing on Tuesday.  IOSCO recommends regulators who do not mandate division by activity to consider prohibiting crypto service providers ""from combining certain functions in a single legal entity or group of affiliated entities,"" as companies often engage in a range of activities such as operating exchanges, engaging in proprietary trading in the same markets, and keeping custody of clients' assets.  During Tuesday's briefing, IOSCO officials pointed to alleged conflicts of interest and mismanagement of client assets by collapsed crypto enterprise FTX as examples for why these measures are crucial for protecting consumers around the world. The report also cites recent allegations made by the SEC against Beaxy and Bittrex for failing to register as securities exchanges, and the case of Ishan Wahi – recently sentenced to two years in jail for revealing details of upcoming Coinbase listings to his brother – as motivation for stronger rules.  In response to a question on whether releasing policy recommendations legitimizes crypto, Servais said IOSCO deals with financial regulation, whereas treating crypto as, for instance, gambling – something a group of U.K. lawmakers recently proposed – is beyond the regulator's scope.  The consultation period on the recommendations closes on July 31.

Technical analysis shows a compelling case for Ethereum’s potential reversal toward the $1,900 mark. The coin has shown signs of finding support at its current levels, and with mounting buying pressure, a bullish trend could be on the horizon. As the crypto market continues to evolve, all eyes are now on Ethereum and its potential reversal. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Struggles To Initiate A Breakout: Will It Defy Resistance And Rebound? Decreasing Volatility, Trading Volume Indicate Potential Reversal For Ethereum Ethereum’s price charts reveal a notable decline in volatility, indicating a potential shift in market sentiment. Volatility, which measures the frequency and magnitude of price fluctuations, is on the decline, suggesting that the bearish sentiment surrounding Ethereum may be losing steam. This drop in volatility often precedes trend reversals and signifies a market that is maturing and finding consensus among investors. Accompanying the decreasing volatility, Ethereum has also experienced a decline in trading volume, a crucial indicator of market activity and investor interest. The reduced trading volume is significant as it signifies a decrease in selling pressure, creating an environment conducive to potential price spikes. For Ethereum, the diminishing trading volume sets the stage for a bullish reversal and hints at the possibility of an upward price surge. Source: Coingecko Amidst these positive indicators, Ethereum continues to ride the wave of success, with CoinGecko reporting an impressive price of $1,862, reflecting a remarkable 3.1% rally in the past 24 hours alone. Furthermore, the cryptocurrency demonstrates a promising seven-day increase of 2.8%, adding to its growing momentum. Source: CryptoQuant Mixed Signals: Staking Inflows Down Despite Ethereum’s positive price momentum and decreasing volatility, recent data from CryptoQuant reveals a decline in staking inflows. On Sunday, staking inflows stood at 93,952 ETH but dropped to 71,648 ETH on Monday. Although still higher compared to recent dips, the decrease in staking inflows suggests a potential shift in investor behavior. On the other hand, the total value staked continues to climb. This indicates that while the rate of increase has slowed down, there is still ongoing interest in staking Ethereum, potentially driven by the prospect of earning passive income through staking rewards. ETHUSD currently at $1,861 on the daily chart at TradingView.com Related Reading: These Top 5 Cryptos Are Seen Making Big Moves This Week Another aspect to consider is the withdrawal profile, which has presented mixed signals. Overnight, there was a notable spike in principal withdrawals, indicating a bearish sentiment. However, projections for the morning session suggest a more bullish outlook, with expectations of principal ETH withdrawals falling to below-normal levels. These withdrawal patterns contribute to the overall uncertainty surrounding Ethereum’s short-term market outlook. While staking inflows decrease and withdrawal activity remains inconsistent, investors and analysts are closely monitoring these indicators to gauge the direction of the market and the sentiment of Ethereum holders. -Featured image from WSJ",POSITIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum-bull-run-toward-1900/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

Crossover operates an execution-only platform, meaning customers need a credit sponsor to trade. Unlike centralized exchanges, customers cannot open an account and send money as there's no settlement option or exchange option, only execution.  The aim of the collaboration is to avoid conflicts of interest by decoupling trade execution from custody and brokerage, allowing institutions the ability to freely choose their own credit counterparties.  Brandon Mulvihill, co-founder and chief executive officer of Crossover said in an interview with CoinDesk that since the fall of crypto exchange FTX and the current hostility from U.S. regulators toward CEXs, TradFi institutions have been scared away and don’t want to face centralized exchanges bilaterally anymore.  “Institutions want to trade crypto the way they would with any other traditional asset class,” Mulvihill said.  Hidden Road customers will have access to CROSSx, Crossover’s execution only communication network (ECN), to execute cryptocurrency spot transactions, according to the press release. Hidden Road is the first firm to onboard with CROSSx, which Crossover launched in March.  Mulvihill said that there are currently 50 customers onboarding, with 60% of these from TradFi companies and the rest crypto native.  “We believe this significant removal of operational friction from the ecosystem will materially increase trading volumes and decrease the costs of trading,” Mulvihill said.

Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Aave allows users to lend and borrow tokens on several blockchains, such as Ethereum, Polygon and Avalanche. The extent of this sometimes causes compatibility bugs to arise, temporarily rendering parts of the platform inaccessible to users and leave funds stuck.  An upgrade last week to the “ReserveInterestRateStrategy” caused the issue, security firm BlockSec tweeted. Affected tokens include tether (USDT), bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and polygon (MATIC).  The ReserveInterestRateStrategy contract is a core contract in Aave that helps calculate and apply interest rates to borrowed loans.  “The root of the problem is that, for legacy reasons, the v2 version used on Aave v2 Polygon (and Avalanche) is slightly different from Aave v2 Ethereum, in regards to the interface used by the LendingPool to call the rate strategy of an asset,” Aave community member BDGLabs explained.  “The new interest rate strategies applied to those assets respect the interface of Aave v2 Ethereum, but not v2 Polygon, so when the LendingPool queries the strategy for the current rate, this call reverts, and so does the action “wrapping” it (e.g. deposit, borrow, etc),” the firm added.  A fix is already in place, voting on by community members and users can top up funds on the network, an Aave governance proposal shows.  Other versions of Aave on Polygon continue to work smoothly as of Tuesday.

The Seychelles-based firm has filed an application to become registered as a Digital Asset Service Provider (DASP). It plans to establish a ""substantial"" physical presence in France, the company's head of global government relations, Tim Byun, said.  It's not the only crypto exchange seeking a base in the European Union's second-largest economy. France last year emerged as the destination of choice for Binance as a European Union (EU) hub following its DASP registration. The world's largest crypto exchange had hired around 150 people for its Paris office by September, according to founder Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao.  ""We would aspire to hire 100 full-time employees within three years,"" Byun said in an interview. ""I think in the first year, we forecast [hiring] about 30 colleagues.""  Byun said he expects the registration process to take up to six months.  Registration involves checking that companies comply with money laundering standards and have reputable management. With the EU's Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation unanimously approved by the 27 member states earlier this month, going forward it should be easier for crypto firms who have obtained approval in one country to operate across the whole bloc.  The AMF suggested last month that existing registered firms in France could be fast-tracked to MiCA licensing, which includes tougher rules on governance, consumer protection and financial stability.

Blockchain explorer data shows the Puppynet testnet has processed more than 11 million transactions from almost 15 million wallets after its launch on March 11. Much of that activity came in the past week, with more than 400,000 transactions over a 24-hour period on May 21,  The upcoming layer 2 network Shibarium will soon join the ever-growing fray of Ethereum-based blockchains, such as Arbitrum and Optimism, looking to solve the problems of scalability, speed, and expense.  Layer 2 refers to a set of off-chain solutions (separate blockchains) built on top of layer 1s that reduce bottlenecks with scaling and data. These bundle multiple off-chain transactions into a single layer 1 transaction, which helps reduce the data load and fees.  Shiba Inu developers have previously said Shibarium would have a focus on metaverse and gaming applications, especially as the non-fungible token (NFT) sector is expected to heat up in the coming years, apart from Shibarium’s use as a cheap settlement for decentralized applications (dapps) built on the network.  The launch could contribute to strong fundamentals for Shiba Inu, formed in the previous bull market as a Shiba Inu-themed meme coin, that has since tried to position itself as a serious project with its own blockchain network and dApp ecosystem.  This move could further bolster the fundamentals of Shiba Inu’s three ecosystem tokens: shiba inu (SHIB), leash (LEASH) and bone (BONE), which together command over $5 billion in market capitalization.

The current price movement of the token suggests a drop in value might occur in the coming days. Defending this price point will be crucial to target $1.4 resistance in the coming days. SNX Powering synthetic assets on the blockchain, Synthetix’s governance token SNX continues to go against the market’s current movement. As of writing, the token is up an impressive 15% in a market where major cryptocurrencies lost value. Lyra, a new options market maker on the block, will also integrate Synthetix perpetuals in its Newport upgrade which will bring more attention to Synthetix. For investors, holding $2.334 will be important for future price actions. However, SNX’s correlation with Bitcoin might pose a problem in the short term. Despite this, $2.334 should be able to hold against any bearishness in the medium to long term. TRX The recent conclusion of Tron’s HackaTron Season 4 produced winners that will help develop DeFi and crypto as a whole. It gave TRX a boost away from the market’s current slippage. Coingecko data reveals that the token’s value has increased by 11% since last week. The token’s current trajectory places it as a prime target for the bears. After nearly a month of continuous gains, investors should be ready for a drop toward $0.06544 in the short term.

The price is now trading above $90 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is a key contracting triangle forming with resistance near $92.50 on the 4-hour chart of the LTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The price could rally toward the $100 and $105 levels. Litecoin Price Eyes Upside Break After a steady increase, Litecoin’s price struggled near the $95 resistance against the US Dollar. LTC price started a downside correction and traded below the $92 level. The price tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $5.26 swing low to the $95.00 high. However, the bulls seem to be protecting a downside break, unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum. Litecoin is now consolidating above the $90 level. It is trading above $90 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is also a key contracting triangle forming with resistance near $92.50 on the 4-hour chart of the LTC/USD pair. Source: LTCUSD on TradingView.com On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $93 zone. The next major resistance is near the $95 level. If there is a clear break above the $95 resistance, the price could start another strong increase. In the stated case, the price is likely to continue higher toward the $100 and $105 levels. Any more gains might send LTC’s price toward the $112 resistance zone. Fresh Decline in LTC? If Litecoin price fails to clear the $95 resistance level, there could be a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $91 level and the triangle lower trend line. The next major support is forming near the $85 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $5.26 swing low to the $95.00 high, below which there is a risk of a move toward the $80 support. Any further losses may perhaps send the price toward the $75 support.

Now, new items on his latest billing report suggest there is work underway to do just that.  Filings show that Ray spent 6.7 hours on items related to “2.0” which is thought to mean FTX 2.0, a reboot of the exchange.  To date, there is no evidence, aside from hypothetical statements, that there is a concrete plan to restart the exchange aside from internal sketches, though Ray has not ruled it out entirely.  “Everything is on the table,” Ray told the Journal in January. “If there is a path forward on that, then we will not only explore that, we’ll do it.”  In April, Andy Dietderich, FTX's lead attorney, suggested that the cryptocurrency exchange may potentially restart operations, an action that would require significant capital and might offer customers interest in the future exchange, though he stressed that this is one of many possibilities and decisions are far from final.  VC firm Tribe Capital has reportedly expressed interest in leading a funding round to restart the exchange.  However, industry insiders have casted doubts on the viability of such a plan due to persistent technical deficiencies, notably high latency, and software bugs, that plagued FTX from its inception and played a part in its financial collapse in 2022.  With all the work that would be required to bring fix FTX’s trading engine and other bugs, one could simply build a new exchange from the ground up – minus the baggage associated with the name.  FTX’s former token FTT is up 12% on the news, according to CoinGecko data.

A report from Shiba Inu’s token burn aggregator, Shibburn, indicates that the SHIB Army has significantly raised the burning rates within the past 24 hours. The data showed that the community destroyed 50.18 million SHIB tokens in 24 hours. SHIB Burn Rate Picks Up After Some Days Of Decline The SHIB burn rate surged 8,627% over the past 24 hours compared to the previous day. The burning process was completed through two transfers: the burn of 39,511,911 and 10,676,779 SHIB tokens. Cumulatively, the community moved about 3.09 billion SHIB tokens to the dead wallet within the past week. As of Saturday, May 20, the Shiba Inu burn rate for the week showed a surge of 666% for the past week. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Double Fractal Points To “Extended” Parabolic Rally Further, the Shiburn website shows the Shiba Inu community collectively destroyed 410,642,087,431,967 SHIB tokens. Currently, the meme coin has about 574,308,140,003,340 SHIB coins as its total circulating supply. Shibarium Token Burn Details Excites The SHIB Army The layer 2 solution network of Shiba Inu, Shibarium, has made tremendous progress while still in the beta-test phase. The Shiba Inu team, under the leadership of the pseudonymous Shytoshi Kusama, disclosed the SHIB burning mechanism on Shibarium. According to details, fees for all transactions completed on Shibarium are paid in BONE. The basic fees for all transactions are locked on a contract on the network, while the validators will get priority fees. The network will set aside a total of 30% of the fees for maintenance purposes. However, it will burn the remaining 70% of the fees. A Twitter user, SHIB INFORMER, shared a screenshot of Sharium’s interface of the network’s token burning mechanism. Related Reading: Why Bitcoin May Have Completed The “Perfect” Pullback Users can initiate a burning process if the locked BONE exceeds 10 BONE. The network will automatically convert the locked tokens to SHIB coins and transfer them to the protocol’s dead wallet. SHIB Price Gains, Increasing Whale Activities At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.00000890, indicating an increase of 1.46% over the past 24 hours. The value of SHIB saw a slight gain over the weekend after it fell from $0.00000873 to $0.00000871 on May 19. The meme coin has been trying to sustain its hold throughout the bearish wave on Sunday. Following Shiba Inu’s price gain during the weekend, data from analytics firm, IntoTheBlock revealed that more SHIB whales amassed the token. According to the data, investors grabbed over 26.2 trillion SHIB tokens over the past weeks. Also, some whales sold their Shiba Inu holdings, with a cumulative value of 300 billion SHIB coins disposed of. -Featured image from Pexels and chart from Tradingview.com",POSITIVE,SHIB,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ICO | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-burn-rate-spikes-after-a-few-stagnant-days/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/12862680.jpeg

The trader believes it could take one more price pullback for BTC to climb higher. Nonetheless, Brandt calls this price forecast a guess, adding that guessing is the best he can offer. Brandt told his followers to run and protect their assets from anyone dogmatic about his price analytics. “…If anyone is dogmatic about their brilliance, turn and run, protecting your wallet,” he wrote. Major BTC Price Breakout Could Be Imminent Bitcoin traded bearish in the last few days, with a 0.8% price decline over the past 24 hours. Though BTC closed May 21 with a slight price increase, the asset remains below the primary pivot point, trading at $27,132 at press time. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Double Fractal Points To “Extended” Parabolic Rally According to data by notable blockchain analytics firm, Glassnode, Bitcoin recorded a 3.4% price range in the last seven days. The data confirms the number one crypto asset is witnessing one of its tightest periods in the last three years. According to the analytic firm, the current price movement aligns with the bearish trading recorded in January 2023 and July 2020. These two intervals preceded large market moves, suggesting that high volatility is probably near, added Glassnode. This observation concurs with Brandt’s latest prediction, where he claims Bitcoin would thrust higher after one more shakeout. Meanwhile, Brandt isn’t the only analyst who thinks that a price breakout, after some pullbacks, is on the horizon. Crypto analyst Carl from the Moon had spotted a symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating consolidation. Carl highlighted a target of 25K or $29K, depending on the direction of the price breakout. Surging Bitcoin Transaction Fees Constitute A Lackluster To Potential Bull Runs Although technical indicators suggest a major price move for Bitcoin, Glassnode’s recent reports noted that the surging network fee drives the market lower. BTC transaction fees have skyrocketed as the Bitcoin network struggles with congestion due to massive unconfirmed transactions. According to reports, the network congestion was due to increased minting and transferring of Ordinal NFTs and BRC20 tokens. The network flooded with transactions, causing node overloads and an overwhelmingly large backlog of unconfirmed transactions. Related Reading: Why Bitcoin May Have Completed The “Perfect” Pullback This issue slowed down transaction speed and triggered a hike in transaction fees. It has equally repelled users from conducting Bitcoin transactions, reducing transfer volumes. As of May 20, the total transfer volume in the Bitcoin network had reduced to $2.73 billion per day. That’s a significantly lower throughput than the over 15 trillion recorded during the 2021 bull market. -Featured image from Pexels, Chart from TradingView",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/prominent-crypto-trader-drops-shocking-bitcoin-price-prediction/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/12861835.jpeg

42420376,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpXgb,1684801842,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Holds Steady Near $27K as Investors Weigh Debt Ceiling Developments,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin at $26.8K maintains its debt-ceiling holding pattern.  Insights: Crypto as a hedge? The citizens in two large, emerging countries and other major significant economies seem to be turning to digital assets as their currencies struggle.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $26,866, up 0.4%. BTC has hovered between $26,500 and $27,500 for almost two weeks, according to CoinDesk data, amid macroeconomic uncertainties, including concerns that U.S. President Joe Biden and House leadership would be unable to reach an agreement about raising the country’s debt limit.  “Crypto traders are not sure how Bitcoin will behave throughout the next several days of debt ceiling negotiations,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in a note.  Moya added: The risk of default is very small but if it were to happen, that could feel like an uppercut to risk appetite, which would send cryptos sharply lower. Bitcoin appears content to trade near the lower boundaries of its recent trading range between $26,500 and $30,000.”  Since 1960, the government has increased the debt limit 78 times, but the current, charged political environment has raised anxiety about the willingness of lawmakers to work together.  In a letter to Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen reiterated a May 15 warning that without an agreement, “the Treasury Department would be unable to satisfy all the government’s obligations by early June, and potentially as early as June 1.”  “We have learned from past debt limit impasses that waiting until the last minute to suspend or increase the debt limit can cause serious harm to business and consumer confidence, raise short-term borrowing costs for taxpayers, and negatively impact the credit rating of the United States,” Yellen added. “We have already seen Treasury’s borrowing boats increase substantially for securities maturing in June.”  Ether was recently changing hands at about $1,820, up 0.8%. The second largest crypto in market value has been similarly range-bound between $1,750 and $1,850 over the past two weeks. Other major cryptos were largely in the green, albeit paler shades, with TRX and AVAX, the tokens of smart contracts platform Tron and Avalanche, recently up 3.8% and 2.3%, respectively. The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto markets performance, recently rose 0.4%  Among major equity indexes, the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.5% to hit a 2023 high, while the S&P 500, which has a vital technology component, and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) ticked up 0.2% and 0.4%, respectively. Yields on Treasurys rose, and the price of gold sank slightly to $1,990, well below its near-record high early this month when investors were turning more to safe-haven assets.  Meanwhile, in an interview with CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” program Monday, Ahmed Ismail, CEO of quant-based liquidity aggregator Fluid, said that the retreat of market makers Jane Street and Jump Trading from crypto trading in the U.S. had spooked investors, decreasing an already dwindling supply of market liquidity.  “One of the very big problems that crypto suffers with is liquidity being massively fragmented, and events such as this only exacerbate the problem,” Ismail said. “So what we're seeing right now is there is not much activity because liquidity is even more fragmented, and markets are very inefficient. As a result, you will see I think we are seeing certain narratives coming back.  Ismail noted an increase in call options on crypto exchange Bybit, a signal of unrest about the debt ceiling and other macroeconomic uncertainties. “The narrative of people taking liquidity out because they’re afraid of what’s going to happen and the uncertainty around the debt ceiling, that’s certainly a huge problem in keeping (the) crypto crisis so narrow now.”  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Shiba Inu SHIB +3.4% Currency Avalanche AVAX +2.7% Smart Contract Platform Polygon MATIC +1.9% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Loopring LRC −0.5% Smart Contract Platform Terra LUNA −0.5% Smart Contract Platform Solana SOL −0.3% Smart Contract Platform  Insights  Crypto as Hedge  With the U.S. mired in political stasis while other regions build crypto frameworks, it’s worth looking at the evolution of, and outlook for, on-the-ground demand for crypto assets. This is getting more and more relevant as many large countries struggle with skyrocketing inflation, shaky currencies and autocratic control over financial access, and as populations become increasingly crypto-aware and a lack of trust in centralized institutions grows.  Last week, the government of Pakistan (the fifth largest country in the world in terms of population, with over 239 million inhabitants) was reported to have said that cryptocurrencies “will never be legalized” in Pakistan, in order to avoid FATF penalties.  Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.  This may sound on the surface like an overreaction to FATF’s crypto stance – last Thursday, the organization’s president published a letter titled “An end to the lawless crypto space” which urges crypto regulation rather than a total ban.  Then again, Pakistan has a somewhat tense relationship with the FATF, and just last October was taken off its “grey list” (which labels certain countries as having “deficiencies” in their AML controls, which in turn can lead to limited participation in global finance).  It’s also not hard to see the hand of the International Monetary Fund. Pakistan is currently in talks with the organization regarding a bailout package, although negotiations seem stalled and concern about the country’s political and economic issues is starting to affect neighboring nations. The IMF has not been shy about its unease with crypto markets, and a few months ago, reports surfaced that it had applied crypto-suppression conditions to negotiations with Argentina.
