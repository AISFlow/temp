42427233,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK11xh,1484169059,"As India Goes Cashless, its Central Bank Researches Blockchain","Could blockchain tech take India cashless?  As India's government pushes ahead with a controversial plan to move the country away from physical cash, a group of researchers backed by its central bank has called for an investigation into how blockchain could achieve that goal.  The Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology (IDRBT) was founded in the 1990s by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), and last week, it released its first major white paper focused on blockchain (which includes details of a test related to trade finance applications).  In addition to providing a broad overview of the tech’s mechanics and potential uses in the Indian banking sector, the white paper posits that the time is right to begin assessing how the rupee, India’s national currency, could be digitized through the use of a distributed ledger.  The Indian government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, sparked broad criticism for its move in early November to withdraw high-value banknotes of the Indian rupee, the country's currency. Modi would later double-down on his plan, calling for India to embrace digital money later that month, and the government went on to begin amending legislation to further those plans.  According to IDRBT, blockchain could help achieve that goal.  The full report highlights work being done by central banks in countries like Canada and the UK, among others.  The paper’s authors wrote:  “From a technological perspective, we feel that [blockchain] has matured enough and there is sufficient awareness among the stakeholders which makes this an appropriate time for initiating suitable efforts towards digitizing the Indian Rupee through [blockchain].”  Roadmap call  The authors also suggested other avenues for India’s broader banking sector to experiment with the tech.  To start, it recommends that banks consider standing up their own internal blockchain networks, both as a boon for training purposes as well as a way to see what, if any, benefits the tech could bring to their institutions.  ""Banks may setup a private blockchain for their internal purposes,"" the authors wrote. ""This not only helps them to train human resources in the technology, but also benefits by enabling efficient asset management [and] opportunities for cross-selling.""  From there, IDRBT goes on to say, banks could work cooperatively in the areas of AML/KYC, loan syndication and trade finance.  ""Further areas where BCT can be applied advantageously in BFSI sector would be supply chain finance, bill discounting, monitoring of consortium accounts, servicing of securities and mandate management system,"" the authors added.  Growing footprint in India  That the research group would call for broader use of blockchain within the Indian financial sector is perhaps unsurprising, given recent developments.  It was only last summer that the RBI itself called for domestic banks to pursue research into the tech, calling for institutions to work in conjunction with the IDRBT on possible applications.  ""Cloud-based computing, blockchain processing technologies and virtualization of IT systems are a few examples which hold potential for being used in a big way,” RBI deputy governor Rama Gandhi said during a speech in July. “Banks and IDRBT can work together to study these, test them out and adapt for best use.""  In mid-2015, officials from the central bank posited that while digital currencies could fuel money laundering efforts, they could also improve financial inclusion and reduce payments friction.  Since then, a number of financial institutions – as well as private sector stakeholders beyond the banking world – have moved explore use cases and develop products using the tech.

42427224,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK11jh,1484163908,The IRS is Catching Flack Again for Weak Bitcoin Guidance (This Time on IRAs),"US citizens who invest retirement money in bitcoin or other digital currencies could face unforeseen tax consequences as a result of IRS policies, a government report released this week argued.  Originally prepared in early December, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) published a report on Monday in which it argued that the IRS needs to do more to inform taxpayers about the potential liabilities they face when investing their individual retirement accounts (IRAs) in blockchain-based assets.  As the report states, US law offers a broad degree of leeway when it comes to the types of assets that people can invest in as part of an IRAs (ranging from precious metals to real estate). That said, IRS guidance as it exists today creates the risk that taxpayers may not be entirely aware of tax liabilities (or penalties) that may arise from these investments, the GAO argued.  The report's authors note:  ""Retirement accounts allowing such unconventional investments increase owners' responsibilities in ways they may not understand – and mistakes can trigger taxes and penalties. Moreover, account custodians may prematurely close an account or let valueless assets and fraud go undetected because they did not accurately determine the value of unconventional assets.""  In a way, the report's recommendations – with which the GAO said the IRS ""generally agreed"" – mirror criticisms highlighted in a separate report prepared by the inspector general of the US tax agency.  That report, published in November by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA), said the IRS is at risk of not catching potential tax cheats who use digital currencies to avoid reporting requirements. Tax professionals have also blasted the agency for failing to provide more in-depth guidance.  The IRS has since moved to expand its oversight of digital currency transactions, seeking information on users from digital currency exchange Coinbase as part of that push. (Though it has generated criticism here, too).  In total, more than 485,000 IRA accounts (worth an estimated $49.7bn) are invested in unconventional assets, the GAO said, relying on information gathered from 17 custodians.  However, it is unclear how many may be invested in bitcoin or digital currencies.

Bitcoin prices hit a low of $752.11 – $0.05 beneath the low reported on 2nd December, according to data from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). The figure represents a roughly 42% drop from the market high of $1,153.02 reported on 5th January.  Today saw prices drop below the $800 mark for the first time since 21st December as price volatility shows no sign of abating. Markets are reporting an average price of $768.05, BPI data shows, a drop of more than 15% from the day’s $904.79 opening price. At the time of report, bitcoin was trading at $771.39.  CNY-denominated markets  are down more than 12% for the day, hitting a low of ¥5,010.05. The current average price is ¥5,176.66, according to the BPI.  Some market observers cited ongoing regulatory developments out of China as a key driver behind the recent moves, including Petar Zivkovski, COO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub. It has been revealed in recent days that regulators in China, including officials from the country's central bank, have met with representatives from domestic bitcoin exchanges and is moving to monitor the industry more closely.  According to Zivkovski, some market stakeholders aren't taking the news well.  He told CoinDesk:  ""There's a lot of panic in the market right now due to the Chinese news. Many people are still long from prices high up and will be looking to get out at the sign of a bounce, which may put additional sell pressure on the market.""

42427231,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK11nh,1484154004,'Satoshi Roundtable' Brings Blockchain Bigwigs Back for Third Year,"An annual event traditionally aimed at giving cryptocurrency movers and shakers a chance to hash out industry problems (as well as relax) has opened wide its doors to the larger financial community.  In a post detailing the third annual Satoshi Roundtable, event organizer and Atlantic Financial CEO Bruce Fenton rattled off a list of attendees, including familiar names such as Blockstream CEO Adam Back, Shapeshift CEO Erik Voorhees and Bitcoin Core developers Peter Todd and Eric Lombrozo.  Also included are some members of the broader financial community, such as Fidelity Investments and the World Bank, both of which are returning for their second year.  In the article published to Fenton's LinkedIn followers, he explained that the list of invited attendees was curated to increase the potential insights achieved between events.  Fenton wrote:  ""At The Satoshi Roundtable, we design the entire event to foster and facilitate this type of deep, meaningful discussion among peers whether it's the whole room, a dozen people, or a breakaway with three people who share a very specific common interest.""  The gathering slated for a discrete location in Mexico later this month also includes Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, the president of t0, Jonathan Johnson and Bitcoin.com CEO Roger Ver.  According to Fenton's post, event participants include developers, executives and other ""influencers"" working to develop products on a number of blockchain technologies, including bitcoin, ethereum, Hyperledger and more.  In 2015, the Roundtable was hosted in the in the Dominican Republic, followed by an event in the Port St Lucie Florida last year.  'Unconference' approach  The event has become a venue where leaders building a wide-range of applications on blockchain gather to discuss obstacles facing the industry.  Last year, conversation was largely dominated by questions surrounding the bitcoin scaling debate, according to multiple reports.  This year, the two-day long event will consist of roundtable sessions, coffee meetings cocktail parties and time for breakaway discussions.

The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said earlier this month that employees from 55 startups would take part in the initiative. The “Project for a Bridge of Innovation between Silicon Valley and Japan” was first announced in mid-2015 as part of a bid to boost cooperation between Japanese and US tech firms.  Reps from Keychain GK will spend time in Silicon Valley while those from Quoine and Soramitsu will visit New York as part of the program. The program lasts between January and March, according to METI.  Keychain  focuses on integrating the tech with existing IT infrastructure, according to its website. Quoine is a digital currency exchange in the midst of a Series A funding round while Soramitsu is a startup that last year submitted its ‘Iroha’ blockchain project to the open-source Hyperledger initiative.  A fourth technology firm, HAW International Inc., which has developed a business line focused on blockchain, is also taking part in the program.

42427230,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK11th,1484144150,"R3 Will Close Blockchain's Biggest-Ever Investment in Q1, CEO Says","The founder and CEO of blockchain banking consortium R3CEV says the firm is on the verge of closing the industry's largest-ever funding round.  Originally reported to be as high as a $200m, the downsized $150m round would still give the consortium of global banking members a significant war chest, if it closes at that level.  In conversation with CoinDesk, CEO David Rutter elaborated on how his company has grown, and changed, as part what he described as an imminent cash infusion.  Rutter said:  ""We will be closing the largest round in the industry, with the largest number of market participants, now, in the first quarter.""  To prepare for the investment, Rutter said he's planning to move from R3's New York headquarters to its office in London, which is also the base of chief technology officer and Corda developer Richard Gendal Brown and chief engineer James Carlyle.  R3's managing director Charley Cooper confirmed that the consortium now employs ""over 100"" people in nine different countries, with the lion's share in London.  ""It’s the hub of the tech development team,"" Cooper said.  Of 77 total firms, R3 now counts among its members a number of European institutions, including founding members Barclays, BBVA, Credit Suisse, Commerzbank, SEB and Société Générale.  ""Our Europe team membership is extremely active,"" Rutter added.  And R3’s presence has expanded beyond just New York and London. The group now boasts offices in the US, Canada, the UK, Switzerland, Australia, Singapore, Taiwan, Korea and Japan.  Overcoming obstacles  After making an initial, large splash in the blockchain industry with what seemed like a rolling list of new membership announcements, the banking consortium ended last year with a mix of notable milestones and obstacles.  In April, the company unveiled its Corda distributed ledger technology platform, which within hours of its December release to the open-source community was being built upon by contributors.  But by the end of the year, multiple reports began to trickle in that some of the consortium’s early, influential members had begun the process of leaving the group.  In spite of the difficulties, though, R3CEV held its course, and earlier this week revealed its advisory role in post-trade settlement platform DTCC’s effort to re-platform part of its services on a distributed ledger infrastructure.  Rutter concluded:  ""It’s been a lot of work, some frustrations along the way in order to coordinate all these parties. But I definitely want to celebrate when we get all these things done.""

42427239,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK129h,1484139624,Blockchain Angels Invest $1 Million in Bitcoin-Ethereum Hybrid Qtum,"A new public blockchain that would seek to merge popular design aspects of both the bitcoin and ethereum blockchains has raised $1m in funding.  By marrying bitcoin's transaction model with a similar consensus system to the one in development at ethereum, Singapore-based Qtum is seeking to appeal to distributed application developers who may be experiencing difficulties with one or both systems.  Investors in the company include a host of notable blockchain entrepreneurs, including ethereum founder Anthony Di Iorio, OKCoin CEO Star Xu, BitFund founder Xiaolai Li and Fenbushi partner Bo Shen.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Di Iorio lauded the team's leadership as one of its main strengths.  ""All in all, I believe them to be the best team out of China and Asia,"" he said. ""This has led them to see where improvements are needed in smart contract platforms, learn from mistakes of ethereum, focus on the region they know best.""  As explained by Qtum's founders, the open-source technology borrows key elements from each project, and is thus more of a union of both networks, even though it would have its own blockchain and investable token. (Technically, Qtum is a fork of Bitcoin Core version 0.13, running with the ethereum virtual machine – the element that executes that platform's smart contracts).  Such an idea is also being explored by the team behind the startup Rootstock, which raised $1m in March to bring smart contracts to the bitcoin blockchain.  Patrick Dai, founder of the Qtum Foundation, indicated that the $1m will now help his team to prepare the infrastructure necessary to sell the tokens in a public initial coin offering (ICO), or a public sale of unique cryptographic tokens to investors.  Dai told CoinDesk:  ""We raised the money to prove that our approach is right. We used the money to do the minimum viable product. The testnet is live now, but it is private, it is already working.""  Dai said that the Qtum Foundation could seek to raise up to $10m in the token offering. In Q3 of 2016, nearly $200m was raised in ICOs, according to CoinDesk Research data.  Qtum also claims to be partnering with PwC Asia, which both its team members and investors said will be providing accounting services for the project.  Capitalizing on concerns  While Rootstock aims to improve the bitcoin network, a key aspect of Qtum's pitch is that existing public blockchain developers have become so dissatisfied with their current choices that they will seek a new alternative.  Dai believes that bitcoin and ethereum both have design flaws that would inhibit certain uses, which would enable room for Qtum to become a notable alternative.  For instance, Dai posited that enterprise developers may be dissuaded from launching a private bitcoin network due to its use of proof-of-work for its consensus model.  ""The consensus part is not scalable. You cannot deploy permissioned blockchain and maintain the network,"" Dai said.  Additionally, the early interest in such an idea from the Hyperledger team is further evidence that the new blockchain should be further explored, he suggested.  Built-in oracles  Notably, the design would incorporate support for so-called ""blockchain oracles"" – smart contracts that would serve to facilitate interaction between the blockchain and exterior data feeds.  On Qtum, these contracts would be called ""master contracts"", a feature that Dai believes will be attractive to enterprise firms like Microsoft that are exploring similar concepts.  Microsoft's Project Bletchley, for instance, envisions how corporates may be able to monetize a form of oracle it calls a ""cryptlet"" as a way to boost revenue from data streams.  Of course, the proof will be in how Qtum is ultimately able to attract developer interest – a tall task, Dai admitted.  He concluded:  ""That, of course, is going to be one of the most difficult things, but I think that we have a good strategy for getting people online and starting to make contracts.""

Just days after it was revealed the PBoC's Beijing and Shanghai offices had visited the country's three largest exchanges by volume, the central bank said today that it is pledging to better engage with BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin through continued on-site inspections or meetings.  Discussed at new meetings, according to releases by its Beijing and Shanghai offices, were topics including compliance (anti-money laundering and foreign exchange management).  ""The checks focused on whether the firm was operating out of its business scope, whether it was launching unauthorized financing, payment, forex business or other related businesses, whether it was involved in market manipulation, anti-money laundering or (carried) fund security risks,"" a translation provided by Reuters states.  BTCC CEO Bobby Lee confirmed the meeting to CoinDesk, stating that the PBoC requested data on its operations as well as recommendations on how the government might move to regulate bitcoin exchange operations.  However, Lee stressed that the on-site visitations are ""very common"" for businesses in China and continued to express an optimism about the engagement, which he framed as a long-delayed request from local businesses.

42427240,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK12Dh,1484136278,Bitcoin Investing: Where Wall Street and Silicon Valley Meet,"Chris Burniske is blockchain products lead at ARK Invest, an investment manager focused on disruptive innovation. Adam White is vice president and general manager at Coinbase, where he oversees its exchange service GDAX.  In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, Burniske and White discuss their recently published white paper, ""Bitcoin, a New Asset Class"", unpacking what they see as the tech's investment potential.  While much of the traditional financial world was focused on ""blockchain"" in 2016, few gave bitcoin as much attention.  When brought up, bitcoin was referenced in the context of macroeconomic dislocations like the depreciation of the Chinese yuan, India's banknote ban, or Trump's surprise election win. While these events often provided great examples of its use as a ""disaster hedge"" in the face of capital market turmoil, we believe the bigger story of bitcoin's evolution as a unique asset class was left mostly untouched.  Recently, however, we have witnessed institutional investors awaking to bitcoin's maturation and long-term value proposition in the context of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT).  MPT emphasizes that investors should not consider single investments in isolation, but rather in the context of an overall portfolio.  Using MPT, investors can intelligently construct portfolios by including uncorrelated assets to maximize returns for a given level of risk. Alternative assets such as gold and oil have become a popular means to add diversification to traditional portfolios of equities and bonds.  In our paper, we show that bitcoin's attributes could make it a valuable addition as part of a diversified investment portfolio.  Making the case  Using six years of data, we investigated aspects of bitcoin's market behavior, such as its use cases, volatility, risk-reward profile and price independence.  The results show bitcoin is gaining traction as a disruptive peer-to-peer currency, a development that bodes well for its long-term potential.  As one of the three core pillars of a currency, we think bitcoin's use as a means of exchange is critical for its long term viability. Coinbase has unique insight into how bitcoin is being used as a means of exchange for goods and services, with around 45,000 merchants using its payment processing tools.  In 2016, both the number of transactions and monthly processing volume that merchants accepted using bitcoin, doubled from the previous year.  Some of this volume is being driven by new bitcoin users. For example, the number of Coinbase daily new user signups has also doubled since January 2016. In the broader bitcoin ecosystem, transactional volumes grew 118% year-over-year, with bitcoin's blockchain now processing over $115,000 per minute.  As bitcoin continues to grow, Coinbase and ARK are seeing increased interest and enthusiasm from capital market investors.  We believe many institutional investors are realizing bitcoin may be one of the best ways to get ""blockchain"" exposure in their portfolios.  Volatility decline  Bitcoin’s absolute returns have outpaced most other assets over the last five years, but few realize that its volatility has been dropping too. When measured by the trailing year standard deviation of daily percent price changes, bitcoin's volatility dropped 28% in 2016.  Many people mistakenly equate a rising price with increased volatility. Bitcoin’s 2016 market behavior, however, provided a great counterexample to that misconception.  While bitcoin’s price more than doubled last year, it did so in a gradual manner when compared with the more severe spikes and drops of years past.  An instance of controlled volatility was during the August 2016 compromise of the popular bitcoin exchange Bitfinex, when bitcoin's price dropped sharply only to quickly regain its footing.  We believe this to be a sign of mature investors taking up slack from weak holders, quickly balancing out the order books of bitcoin markets. In prior years, bitcoin’s recovery may not have been so graceful.  To give some context on how much bitcoin’s volatility has decreased, it was 30% less volatile than Twitter’s stock in 2016, and just as volatile as USO, one of the more popular oil ETFs on the market.  Reward versus risk  Dividing absolute returns (minus the risk-free rate) by standard deviation yields an investment calculation called the Sharpe Ratio, which calibrates each unit of return for the risk taken.  Despite its perception as a ""high risk"" asset, in 2016 bitcoin compensated investors twice as much for the risk they took than the S&P 500 did.  Moreover, 2016 provided bitcoin’s best year of risk-adjusted returns ever, as shown in the graph below from our white paper.  Over the years, bitcoin has behaved in a relatively independent manner from the broader capital markets. We believe price independence is a valuable characteristic in a world where the cadence of macroeconomic dislocations seems to be accelerating.  As we saw in 2008, world markets tend to be highly correlated in times of crisis.  Bitcoin, however, has shaken that trend and consistently demonstrated low correlation with other capital market assets, shown below.  Bitcoin demonstrated its differentiation as an emerging asset class within the capital markets in 2016. That said, if more institutional investors begin to incorporate bitcoin into their portfolios, bitcoin may intensify in its correlation with other capital market assets.  For example, when investigating bitcoin's correlation with gold, it was interesting to us that in 2016 its correlation reversed, climbing back into positive territory.  Certainly, correlation does not imply causation, but the narrative of bitcoin as gold 2.0 appears to be gaining steam in the capital markets.  If bitcoin shows increased correlation with other capital market assets in 2017, then 2016 may mark the beginning of convergence between the Street, the Valley, and Satoshi’s currency.

42427237,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK125h,1484131740,"BitX Rebrands as Luno, Reveals Bitcoin Sandbox Project","Bitcoin startup BitX has officially rebranded as Luno, a transition that finds the firm shifting focus to the European market.  For the startup, which was founded in 2013, CEO Marc Swanepoel said the new name isn't about shifting away from bitcoin. Rather, he says it's about creating a brand that's both easily digestible and that doesn't bring to mind the connotation that the firm is only an exchange service.  ""I think some companies rebranded because they wanted to move into blockchain,"" he said. ""We are totally the opposite: our website and products, we're very focused on bitcoin.""  Swanepoel told CoinDesk:  ""We'd like to say that we're digital currency agnostic in theory, but in practice, we can't see any digital currency compete with bitcoin. We're firm believers of bitcoin as a protocol.""  The shift follows a number of smaller moves that could help the company continue to support its mission.  'Stepping stone'  Luno also revealed today that it has been accepted into a government sandbox supervised by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Swanepoel said the move is intended to serve as a ""stepping stone"" that will enable it to extend its bitcoin wallet, exchange and enterprise services into European markets.  Luno is now testing how its services can be used to transfer value between GBP and bitcoin within the sandbox, according to the CEO.  Swanepoel added that the service is also set to expand through a partnership with bitcoin processing startup Simplex, which will help Luno launch services in Canada and Europe soon.  The announcement comes at a time when many bitcoin startups are rebranding amid increased enterprise interest in the technology. For example, bitcoin exchange itBit has rebranded as Paxos and Latin American wallet service BitPagos changed its name to Ripio.  To date, Luno has raised more than $4m in funding.
