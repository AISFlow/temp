42401251,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcOOLi,1520980243,Square Seeks BitLicense to Bring Bitcoin Buying to NY,"Digital payments company Square is in the process of applying for a BitLicense in a bid to expand its Cash App's bitcoin buying option to New York.  A spokesperson for Square confirmed the process following a tweet on Tuesday that suggested the company was ""working on"" opening up bitcoin buys and sells to users in that area. The company didn't immediately respond to a follow-up question about whether Square had already submitted an application or if it is preparing to do so.  To date, only a handful of companies have been granted a BitLicense, the regulatory framework first instituted in 2015. The controversial launch ultimately led to a number of companies opting to stop offering services in the state, though recent comments from state lawmakers indicate that the BitLicense may see some revisions in order to alleviate some of those concerns.  Additionally, the Cash App is now available to users in Wyoming, following the passage of legislation in the state that eases the burden on companies that provide cryptocurrency services. Previously, crypto startups had largely stayed away from the state, but this month's move to exempt those companies from Wyoming's money transmission statutes effectively cleared the runway for such launches.  The payments app had previously rolled out bitcoin features for most American users in January, excluding customers in four states with stricter regulations, including Wyoming and New York.

42401262,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcOORc,1520978420,What to Expect When Congress Talks ICOs Today,"Cryptocurrencies are heading back to Capitol Hill on Wednesday.  On March 14, a subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee will hold a hearing entitled ""Examining Cryptocurrencies and ICO Markets."" The hearing marks the first time a group within Congress will specifically tackle the question of initial coin offerings (ICOs), an area that is firmly in the cross-hairs of agencies like the SEC as well as regulators around the world.  Statements from some of the members of the Capital Markets, Securities and Investment Subcommittee suggest that the hearing will have a largely educational bent. Speaking to CoinDesk last week, U.S. Representative Tom Emmer indicated that some of those attending are there to learn more about cryptocurrencies and token sales.  ""I think this is going to be more elementary,"" he said during an interview on the sidelines of last week's DC Blockchain Summit in Washington, D.C. ""I don't think they understand the depth or breadth of this thing – yet.""  Other comments speak to the ""appetite"" for discussion that Emmer highlighted. In a statement to CoinDesk, Rep. Randy Hultgren expressed a desire to talk about investor protections as they relate to ICOs.  ""I look forward to discussing how cryptocurrencies can open up new opportunities in our financial markets. Specifically, I’m interested in discussing how to balance access to credit and investor protection as it relates to so-called initial coin offerings,"" he said.  A previously published list of witnesses certainly reinforces the informational nature of the hearing. Set to appear are Dr. Chris Brummer, a law professor from Georgetown University; Mike Lempres, Coinbase's chief legal and risk officer; Peter Van Valkenburgh, research director for the non-profit advocacy group Coin Center; and Robert Rosenblum, a partner at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati.  The degree of legal expertise tapped for the panel suggests that the discussion is likely to revolve around regulatory topics, especially on the question of classifying some tokens as securities.  Latest Congressional foray  The hearing represents the latest significant gathering of U.S. lawmakers around the topic of cryptocurrencies, coming over a month after the U.S. Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee heard from the leaders of both the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (SEC) in early February.  That event  notably saw both the SEC's Jay Clayton and the CFTC's J. Christopher Giancarlo suggest that their respective agencies may one day come to Congress in an effort to see their jurisdictions extended to cover more of the cryptocurrency market.  That said, both agency chiefs indicated that they want to provide an accommodative environment for the tech – but not at the expense of investor protection and enforcement against potential scams.  ""We owe it to this new generation to respect their enthusiasm for virtual currencies, with a thoughtful and balanced response, and not a dismissive one,"" Giancarlo remarked at the time.  Congress also has several bills related to cryptocurrencies, and while the long-term success of those measures isn't certain in a politically-charged environment, Wednesday's discussion may ultimately come into play as lawmakers look at proposals to beef up federal-level oversight of exchanges and study the link between cryptocurrencies and terrorism financing.  In the days following the Senate hearing in February, two House subcommittees held a hearing on blockchain, which, while it largely veered away from the topic of regulation, served as a platform for lawmakers to learn more about the technology.

42401249,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcOOJk,1520971257,No-Fork Guarantee? New Cryptocurrency Touts Resistance to Code Splits,"The team behind a soon-to-be-launched cryptocurrency has issued the notable claim that it will be un-forkable.  Announced today, Hedera is a public network built on Hashgraph, a type of distributed ledger technology (DLT) developed by the software company Swirlds, which has already deployed private versions with several enterprise clients.  Hedera Hashgraph, the governing body for the network, raised $18 million through a private sale of the as-yet-to-be-named token in January. That sale, the company said, represented less than 20% of the total supply.  Different than a blockchain, Hashgraph is billed as more secure, scalable and ""fairer"" than either the proof-of-work mechanism securing bitcoin or the permissioned systems that banks and other corporations have been experimenting with. The creators say the Hedera version can facilitate micropayments, distributed file storage and support smart contracts out of the gate.  And they've landed a prominent user – MZ, formerly Machine Zone, a game developer behind popular apps like Mobile Strike, said it would build distributed applications on top of the protocol.  But perhaps what’s most striking about Hedera is the use of a patented – rather than open-source – codebase in an otherwise open network.  While the code will be publicly reviewable, and developers will be free to build applications on top of the network without a license, the governing body for Hedera says it will enforce the patent to prevent copying of the codebase or the creation of a competing platform and associated currency.  Mance Harmon, a co-founder and the CEO of Swirlds, calls this situation ""transparency with stability.""  ""We can guarantee our platform will never fork,"" he told CoinDesk, adding that it will be ""one platform with one currency forever.""  While the option of forking is viewed by many in crypto as a positive, since it allows those unhappy with a particular project's direction to go their own way (not to mention sometimes providing free money to those who hold the original token), ""we view that as a hindrance to mainstream market adoption,"" Harmon said.  Hedera’s white paper lays out the rationale this way:  The hard forks that bitcoin & ethereum have experienced have arguably damaged the network effect of their corresponding currencies - creating confusion & uncertainty in the marketplace. Similarly, the explosion of altcoins (and the dubious legitimacy & value of many of them) does not engender the necessary confidence in businesses & consumers considering adopting crypto currencies.""  Swirlds, which patented the network technology, granted an irrevocable license to Hedera Hashgraph, the governing body, for use in the public network, according to Harmon.  Visa as a model?  In another departure from the usual set-up of a public network, the actual governance process for Hedera is permissioned, or restricted to only certain parties.  Hedera Hashgraph consists of 39 ""known and reputable organizations,"" according to the white paper, all of whom collectively own two-thirds of the supply of the network’s token.  Swirlds is one of the 39, and a spokeswoman said the other names would be announced in the coming weeks. Harmon said they include banks as well as companies working in the healthcare, media and legal industries.  ""The goal was to make sure no single party has no more or less influence over the network than any single party,” said Harmon. All the 39 members are ""on par with one another,"" he explained.  The model was the governing structure that Dee Hock used in 1968 to create National BankAmericard, which is known today as Visa – again, not the usual cypherpunk inspiration. According to the white paper, the governing body will control the money supply and manage changes to the codebase.

CFTC Commissioner Brian Quintenz has consistently advocated for the creation of a crypto SRO, calling for such a move during last week's keynote at the DC Blockchain Summit in Washington, D.C.  In a statement released on Tuesday, he congratulated the Winklevosses on their ""thoughtful approach"" to the area, going on to say:  ""Ultimately, a virtual commodity SRO that has the most independence from its membership, the most diversity of views, and the strongest ability to discover, reveal, and punish wrongdoing will add the most integrity to these markets. I encourage Gemini (or any other market participant, advocacy group, platform, or firm) to be aggressive in promoting these qualities within any SRO construct.""  As detailed in a new blog post, Gemini's proposed ""Virtual Commodity Association"" would function as a non-profit, independent organization to be governed by a board of directors. It would ""not provide regulatory programs for security tokens or security token platforms"" or function as a trade organization. The Winklevosses wrote that the group would be modeled in part after the National Futures Association, an SRO focused on the derivatives industry.  ""We believe adding an additional layer of oversight on virtual commodity cash markets, in the form of self-regulation, is important for consumer protection and to ensure the integrity of these markets,"" they wrote.  Membership will be open to ""virtual commodity platforms"" and over-the-counter (OTC) trading firms, in addition to ""other trading facilities acting as counterparties"" which provide an ""all-to-all platform or venue, available to U.S. participants, for transacting in the spot virtual commodity markets,"" among other types of businesses that service the space.  ""We believe a thoughtful SRO framework that provides a virtual commodity regulatory program for the virtual commodity industry is the next logical step in the maturation of this market,"" the Winklevosses concluded.

The cryptocurrency exchange said the move forms part of a plan to transition from ""a company to a community"" by developing its new Binance Chain, which will be used to transfer or trade different blockchain assets. In addition, the company announced it would essentially shift its Binance Coin (BNB) to its own native blockchain (right now the coin is an ERC20 token that runs on the ethereum network). However, it's unclear if there will be some kind of token swap for users who hold the exchange's ERC-20-based token.  The token, in turn, would be the basis for a blockchain-based asset exchange, an option that would exist alongside Binance's more centralized offerings.  The exchange said in a statement:  ""We believe significant improvements can be made in providing Binance users with a level of trading experience to which they are already accustomed. Centralized and Decentralized exchanges will co-exist in the near future, complementing each other, while also having interdependence.""  The news comes a day after Binance announced a bounty program to track down the attackers who recently attempted to steal funds from the exchange's users. Binance said it had allocated $250,000 worth of its BNB token for the first person who shares information leading to the arrest of the attackers.

""The same innovations that power crypto-assets can also help us regulate them. To put it another way, we can fight fire with fire,"" Lagarde wrote in an IMF blog post on Tuesday.  Lagarde warned that cryptocurrencies could create financial instability, as well as facilitate terrorism and money laundering, arguing that distributed ledger technology and cryptography could be used in internationally coordinated regulatory efforts.  Distributed ledger technology, she claimed, ""can be used to speed up information-sharing between market participants and regulators.""  Lagarde wrote:  ""Those who have a shared interest in maintaining safe online transactions need to be able to communicate seamlessly. The technology that enables instant global transactions could be used to create registries of standard, verified, customer information along with digital signatures. Better use of data by governments can also help free up resources for priority needs and reduce tax evasion, including evasion related to cross-border transactions.""  In the post, Lagarde also said that cryptography, in addition to AI and biometrics, could be used to ""remove the “pollution” from the crypto-assets ecosystem.""  According to Lagarde, these technologies, ""can enhance digital security and identify suspicious transactions in close to real time. This would give law enforcement a leg up in acting fast to stop illegal transactions.""  The IMF managing director went on to suggest that regulators should look toward the frameworks of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the Financial Stability Board to inform their own rules.  The views expressed in the blog post largely align with Lagarde's previous comments on cryptocurrencies, though the literal fiery rhetoric could indicate that the IMF is seriously entertaining intervening in the crypto industry sooner rather than later.

""You have this massive amount of content that people are just dumping onto the decentralized web or into OB,” the firm's CEO, Brian Hoffman, told International Business Times. “And there's no Google there to clean it up and serve it up nicely and organize it.”  ""I think our first step is to look at how a token could allow merchants and advertisers to create compelling content and help build businesses,"" he said.  Ambitious though these plans may be, the startup’s investors include some of the biggest names in the cryptocurrency industry.

42401256,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcOOHm,1520950820,ZhongAn Wants to Catch Media Pirates with Blockchain,"ZhongAn Technology, a subsidiary of Chinese online insurer ZhongAn, has filed a patent for a blockchain solution aimed to protect media companies' intellectual property rights in the face of growing piracy and illicit file sharing.  According to a filing published Tuesday by China's State Intellectual Property Office, the system seeks to prevent unauthorized distribution of digital media content by providing the ability to identify who shared the content.  The application states:  ""The development of internet has made it easy for illegal distribution of digital content such as movies and music even after parties have purchased the license from content creators. When such content gets republished after being copied, it's hard to find out who has initiated the unauthorized sharing.""  Effectively, when a certain piece of media content is bought, ZhongAn's blockchain system would link the buyer's ID with the unique data of the purchased item and process the combined information to produce a unique hash that is stored on a blockchain.  If the same content is later discovered on the internet, the system would upload its data and run it through the same hash function, comparing the result with those stored on the blockchain. When a match is found, it would reveal which buyer had violated the licensing agreement.  Formed in 2016 by ZhongAn, which went public in Hong Kong last year, ZhongAn Technology primarily focuses developing emerging technology solutions that can be outsourced to businesses.  The latest patent filing, though still to be approved, signals that the company is keeping its focus on blockchain technology. As reported by CoinDesk, the firm is already applying its blockchain solution to track chicken processing in China using its Ann-chain blockchain platform.  The latest filing also marks yet another effort by an established Chinese technology firm in seeking to patent blockchain solutions for digital rights management, following a similar effort by telecoms and smartphone giant Huawei, as reported last week.

42401265,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcOOUZ,1520949019,Monero Eyes $200 Reversal Target After Hard Fork Delay,"The privacy-focused cryptocurrency monero (XMR) has been dumping the last few days on the news developers have postponed a highly anticipated hard fork by six weeks.  As of writing, the world's 11th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is trading at $258 - down 10 percent in the last 24 hours, according to data source CoinMarketCap.  A week ago, XMR was solidly bid around $380, reporting 90 percent gains over lows seen in February as investors seemingly bought with an intention of making free money via the ""moneroV"" hard fork, originally scheduled for March 15. However, on March 9 the developers announced a delay as requested by users, trading platforms and large mining pools.  Consequently, prices have dropped more than 30 percent in a week.  The hard fork is now scheduled to happen on April 30 at block 1564965 and the holders (at the time of the fork) will receive free moneroV tokens at a ratio of 10 to one.  Given the demand for free coins via forks, this could lead to positive growth a couple of weeks down the line. That said, the technical charts indicate $200 could be a potential bullish reversal point.  Daily chart  The above chart (prices as per Bitfinex) shows:  The bears are in control following a 30 percent week-on-week drop.  The momentums studies are biased bearish: The 5-day moving average (MA) and 10-day MA trend lower, indicating a bearish setup. Also, the 50-day MA has proved to be a strong resistance over the last three days.  The relative strength index (RSI) is below 50.00, suggests scope for a further drop in XMR.  Bullish cypher pattern: Point D ($199) is a bullish reversal point, meaning XRM could bid fresh bids around the key level and will likely rise to $268 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of leg CD) and $310 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of leg CD).  View  XMR could drop to $200 over the next week - a bullish reversal point as per the cypher pattern rules. The cryptocurrency could then rise to $268 and possibly to $310 as discussed above. The scenario gels well with the idea of a pre-fork rally.  However, Feb. 6 low of $150 could be put to test if the cryptocurrency finds acceptance below $200.  On the higher side, only a close (as per UTC) above the 10-day MA would neutralize the bearish outlook and could yield short-term consolidation.  Further, XMR will likely have a tough time against bitcoin, the technical chart indicates. Currently, the XMR/BTC exchange rate is trading at BTC 0.027642 on Bitfinex.  XMR/BTC daily chart  View  XMR will likely test support at BTC 0.026 in the next 24-36 hours and could possibly extend the decline to BTC 0.023 (200-day MA).  Only a close (as per UTC) above the ascending trendline would abort the bearish view.

According to JP Morgan blockchain lead Amber Baldet, they’re faced with the same concerns as anyone building public blockchains today.  ""These problems really aren’t so far apart, it’s just that people are trying to solve the problems in different ways,” Baldet told the audience at EthCC, an ethereum conference in Paris on Friday.  In a tightly packed lecture hall, Baldet laid out the mechanics of her company's private blockchain network, Quorum, while seeking to put forth a broader message about how her bank, one of the largest globally, is looking to foster collaboration across blockchains.  And Baldet is in perhaps a unique position to advance the dialogue: not only is Quorum the first project that JP Morgan developed in its Blockchain Centre of Excellence (BCoE), it's based on a fork of ethereum's software. As such, Baldet spoke at length about how her time is spent engaging with cryptocurrency communities in an effort to find common ground.  “I spend a lot of time talking about ethereum and cryptocurrency and open blockchains to enterprises, businesses, central banks and corporates,” Baldet said, “I don’t spend a lot of time going the other direction.”  Yet, according to Baldet, these conversations are crucial to mutually educate and improve both sectors of the industry. While public and private blockchains are often pitched against each other, Baldet told CoinDesk in an interview, ""I don’t think those two things need to be so different or are necessarily mutually exclusive.""  And while there are trade-offs with public blockchains that enterprises simply cannot afford, what businesses want from ethereum, and what ethereum wants in return, she said, is the ability to interoperate.  In this way, enterprises can inhabit their own private universes away from the public network, but publish data to gain the security and auditability of a public blockchain.  “It doesn’t necessarily have to be all enterprise disaster recovery systems over here, and all anti-fragile public blockchain anonymous transaction things over here,” she said.  Rather, Baldet continued:  ""Pragmatically, it’s probably more likely that we’re going to end up with some kind of hybrid network of networks that can hopefully talk to each other.”  Building connectivity  And interoperability is an area in which Baldet feels businesses have typically failed.  In a refrain on how enterprise software tends to be complicated, fuzzy and proprietary, Baldet told the audience, “When we talk about enterprise blockchain, this is where people get stuck.” And, she believes, the impact of this is that businesses struggle to attract developer talent.  “[Developers] don’t necessarily want to work on something that looks like it was developed in the 1990s,” Baldet said.  As such, it’s down to businesses to cooperate along these lines to create simple, user-friendly software that can interact with existing tech, and work towards interoperability solutions such as Cosmos, Polkadot and Interledger that would allow blockchains to share data.  Elsewhere, Baldet has warned about what she has called “crypto-balkanization,” the splintering of blockchain communities into increasingly uncooperative factions, “virtual continents along political axes” that could “weaken privacy and make interoperability harder.”  Between the two extremes of distributed ledger projects and public blockchains like ethereum, there is a “fuzzy grey area in the middle” that Baldet has termed “mutualized infrastructure.”  A system like this would allow blockchains to communicate while meeting the requirements of different camps, and this, Baldet argued, is the best way to ensure an equal access to services in a fully-fledged internet of value.  She told the audience:  ""We're going to need to do a better job at making software work not exclusively for one group or the other which will continue to bifurcate those power structures, but to actually integrate these things together into one thing.""  Little private universes  Toward that goal, Baldet explained that Quorum and ethereum are purposefully alike, with as much as 95 percent of the software, in her estimation, being similar in both versions.  “It’s actually not changed that much, and that’s intentional, there’s very minimal modification,” Baldet said, during her talk.  Still, unlike the public ethereum blockchain, Quorum is meant to run in a permissioned setting, with every node in the network being identified via a public and private key pair.  Using these keys, smart contracts can be addressed to any node in the network, opening the possibility of private operations, the hash of which is then validated and stored on the Quorum blockchain.  But because of the privacy needs of businesses, or “being able to transact or transmit information without surrendering information ownership,” Baldet explained, there are other layers to the networks confidentiality as well.  Last year, Quorum coupled with privacy-centric cryptocurrency zcash, to integrate a layer of security layer of zero-knowledge cryptography on top of its blockchain.  Called the “zero-knowledge settlement layer,” this allows for zero-knowledge ethereum tokens that only reveal information such as transactional quantity and ownership, and that notably doesn't reveal anything else about the function of the tokens.  And privacy is something that concerns Baldet in public blockchains as well.  “We could do a lot to reverse the aggregation and centralization and creation of data lakes, which over time, especially in a transparent public blockchain, are going to at some point become surveillance lakes,” Baldet told the audience, continuing:  “Figuring out a way to balance privacy with data transmission is critical. Not just for business but I think also for public endeavours.”  Feedback loops  But privacy is just one innovation that Baldet helped spearhead on public ethereum.  Another crucial exchange is the benefit that private blockchains could have for scalability, to stop the overburdening of the public blockchain by bringing certain projects off-chain. CryptoKitties, she reminded the audience, “didn’t work out well for anyone for a few days.”  In conversation with CoinDesk, Baldet elaborated, stating, “It’s not helping scale public ethereum by scaling public ethereum, but it’s taking some of the load off the network.”  By pegging itself closely to the platform and keeping up with its development, ""Quorum benefits from all the security and scaling research happening on mainnet ethereum,” Baldet said, adding:  “Conversely, if someone is building an application that needs more processing power or more space than is efficient to run on the ethereum mainnet, they are starting to try it out on Quorum. The innovation goes both ways.”  Pending the release of new interoperability protocols, such projects can continue to interact and support each other for alternate, customized environments, “private environments on the side,” as Baldet named them, “their own little universe.”  And an interactive network of cooperative, public and private blockchains is close to ethereum’s vision.  At the launch of the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance last year, founder of ethereum Vitalik Buterin went so far as to call for collaboration between the open blockchain and businesses, stating, “we have shared challenges.”  Baldet explained:  “I don't hear people say that they are ethereum maximalists such that they believe that no other computers should exist. That just wouldn’t make sense. So, the conversation has been more about how to transition to using this sort of technology.”  Amber Baldet image via Twitter",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | DOT | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Rachel-Rose O'Leary,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/03/13/jp-morgans-amber-baldet-on-what-enterprise-wants-from-ethereum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c78139253400920cfb66155a96c44e70eb4f5b71-1588x1062.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a report from the Bangkok Post on Tuesday, SCB, one of the largest commercial banks in the country, is now adding euros and British pounds to its cross-border remittance system powered by tech from Ripple, the San Francisco-based blockchain startup.  According to the bank's chief strategy officer, Arak Sutivong, in an interview with the Post, the decision to add the new currency options came after the SCB noticed significant euro and pound inflow to the country.  With the update to be completed by the third quarter of this year, Arak said the two new currencies will initially be focused on inbound remittance for retail customers through collaboration with banking members within the Ripple network.  The plan adds to the existing Japanese yen remittance option that is being tested by the bank as part of a wider effort from a consortium of over 60 Japanese and South Korean banks in piloting Ripple's blockchain settlement solution.  In fact, the bank said it had been conducting remittance trials since June of last year, allowing Thais in Japan to send funds back to their home country, through a sandbox approach under the oversight of the Bank of Thailand, the country's central bank.

42401261,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcOOTa,1520937362,Down But Not Out: Bitcoin Remains on Hunt for $10K,"Bitcoin (BTC) is reporting losses today, having failed to beat the key moving average resistance on Monday, however, the technical charts continue to favor a rally to $10,000.  Bitcoin ran into bids in early European hours yesterday, rising to a four-day high of $9,885, adding credence to Sunday's bullish ""outside day"" candle. Further, BTC also witnessed a bull flag breakout (a bullish continuation pattern) on the hourly chart.  However, the bulls ran out of steam near the 50-day moving average (MA) resistance of $9,920 in the early U.S. hours.  As of writing, bitcoin is trading at $9,297, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). The cryptocurrency has depreciated by 4.59 percent in the last 24 hours, as per data source CoinMarketCap.  Daily chart  BTC's retreat from the high of $9,900 to $8,770 (prices as per Bitfinex) poured cold water on the optimism generated by the Sunday's bullish outside day candle and the bullish triangle breakout.  Further, it also established the 50-day MA as a strong resistance (seen today at $9,888). BTC alsoclosed yesterday (as per UTC) below the Feb. 25 low of $9,280, marking a failure to hold above the double top neckline.  The momentum studies show bear bias too. The 10-day moving average is sloping downwards, and there's a bearish crossover between the 10-day MA and the 50-day MA. So, it appears the odds are stacked against a move above $10,000.  That said, BTC is still trading well above the long-legged doji candle low of $8,342 set on March 9. The candlestick pattern represents bearish exhaustion.  So, it seems safe to say the odds of a corrective rally are above 50 percent, as long as BTC stays above $8,342.  1-hour chart  The hourly chart below shows a bullish 50-MA and 100-MA crossover.  Hence, the cryptocurrency could visit the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern neckline resistance seen around $9,850. An upside break would open doors for $11,000 (target as per the measured height method).  View  The 4-hour chart favors a rally to $9,850 (inverse head-and-shoulders neckline). An upside break would allow a rally to $10,417 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from the March 5 high of $11,700). A violation there would expose resistance at $11,000 (inverse head-and-shoulders breakout target).  However, the sustainability of gains is under question as the weekly chart shows the relative strength index (RSI) has rolled over in favor of the bears. Thus, only a weekly close above $11,700 would confirm a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change.  On the downside, a move below $8,770 (previous day's low) could yield a re-test of $8,428 (Sunday's low).  Only a daily close (as per UTC) below $8,342 (long-legged doji candle low of March 3) would add credence to the bearish weekly RSI and open doors for a sustained drop to $6,000 (February low) and $5,400 (Nov. 12 low).

42401252,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcOOKj,1520935252,"Spooked By SEC, Video Streaming ICO Halts Airdrop","Entrepreneurs are starting to doubt that crypto tokens can be used at all in the U.S.  In fact, according to Simar Mangat, the co-founder of distributed video streaming startup Stream, the current environment of regulatory uncertainty and rumors of subpoenas is putting such a pinch on projects that many are thinking about ""moving elsewhere.""  But, while that hasn't happened yet for the Silicon Valley-incubated startup, the threat of regulator action is leading it to overhaul its product roll-out – drastically. Announced Tuesday, Stream is releasing a white paper that outlines its token distribution, but the process is on hold until the team knows how U.S. regulators will permit its tokens to be used.  Launched in October, Stream had planned to give live-streamers, vloggers and online video makers a way to break platform lock-in by building a Chrome extension that allowed fans to tip creators wherever a video appeared, but the firm says its whole project has now been thrown into question.  Mangat explained:  ""If there were a path of how to do things right, that would be so much better.""  The problem for Stream is that its strategy relies heavily on using a so-called ""utility token"" to fuel a distributed network. Not only that, but the ability of tokens to be distributed and traded easily and converted to fiat currency made them ideal for Stream's business plan.  And this fitted with general industry thinking until very recently.  In 2017, startups generally believed that a utility token would be good to issue so long as the platform went live eventually. Even then, many doubted that they could be sold prior to a platform launch to non-accredited investors, but startups have begun canceling public sales amid the uncertainty.  Now, Stream's counsel is questioning if any tokens at all can be circulated in the U.S. without the full know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) registration of anyone that holds them, or if stream tokens must now be registered as securities.  Spanner in the works  And that determination could dramatically impact Stream's strategy.  According to the white paper, $100 million in tips went to content creators in 2017, but the authors believes more value could have been unlocked through the use of blockchain-based currencies that, like its token, enable tip creators to exchange crypto for real-world value.  In many ways, the idea builds on what YouTube started, giving individual creators a way to build audiences and one-person entertainment businesses. And even Silicon Valley names who have been involved in successful video startups see Stream's model as a natural evolution.  Steve Chen, a YouTube co-founder, is an advisor to Stream today.  ""They actually built this idea of a content creator and being able to create that kind of economy,"" Mangat said of YouTube's originators.  Stream would let creators keep the lion's share of what their tips earned, all driven by the speed and efficiency of the ethereum blockchain. Adoption would take a while with fans, of course, but as long as platforms like Twitch keep 40 percent of tip revenue, creators have an incentive to persuade followers to switch.  However, if Stream can't use its token, it raises questions about whether the company can do anything at all.  'Rebasing' Stream  Borrowing terminology from GitHub, the founders are now doing what open-source coders call a ""rebase,"" aiming to make the best of a difficult path ahead.  That's not to say Stream hasn't shown a willingness to make key changes in strategy, starting with a shift in CEOs in January, with Mangat stepping in for former exec Ben Yu.  The company has also changed how it would distribute tokens over time. For example, it had originally planned to redistribute its increased market cap to creators based on performance, as CoinDesk previously reported. Instead, Stream later shifted to a scheduled release or ""airdrop"" of its tokens.  Stream would come to decrease its overall token supply as well, dropping the figure from 12.6 billion to 10 billion as a way to repay early backers for some of the unexpected gains made in the value of ether since those early investments.  Perhaps most importantly, the team cancelled plans for a public token sale, choosing instead to raise all the money they needed in private sales to accredited investors. In order to build adoption and buzz for the project, they planned to do an airdrop to early supporters in their Telegram and other channels, as they described on Medium.  The plan was to distribute 500 million of their total 10 billion tokens with an airdrop to different people who'd already shown their interest, rather than offering it for sale.  With so many changes, though, the company sent out a message to everyone who had invested so far, updating them all on the new course and making sure that they are still comfortable with the strategy.  To that end, Stream also gave previous investors until Friday to request refunds on their investment. Two people who had invested as individuals chose to take back funds, including Stellar founder Jed McCaleb. According to Mangat, the investors pulled out because they didn't think that as individuals they knew how to correctly price the risk of regulatory uncertainty.  Institutional investors like Pantera and FBG Capital (among others) stayed in. Michael Arrington, TechCrunch's founder, also remained.  Building a wall?  Finally, late last week, the company decided the uncertainty went further than they thought. The original plan had been to launch the Chrome extension, release a round of investor tokens on the vesting schedule and airdrop tokens to supporters all on the same day later this month.  ""It is basically delayed indefinitely with our legal team to make sure we can move forward in the most compliant way possible,"" Mangat explained to CoinDesk.  The sticking point is whether or not all tokens are securities. If they are, it could be that an airdrop is dangerous. Mangat pointed out that there were cases of companies giving away equityhttps://www.sec.gov/news/headlines/webstock.htm during the dot-com bubble, and securities regulators took action.  As such, the company is in the middle of finding out if all tokens have to be registered or if there's a way they could distribute free tokens under the SEC's ""Reg S,"" which provides for unregistered securities outside the country.  Which raises the question of whether a whole new tech economy could come up outside a firewall around the U.S.  Of course, there is another option. Stream could give up on its own token and just run all the tips on ether, which despite having been issued in an ICO has been free from regulator scrutiny.  Mangat said:  ""It's really easy for us to switch to ethereum, but right now we are trying to figure out how we can make this work with stream token.""

42401248,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcOOIl,1520915412,Coinbase Releases Cryptocurrency Tax Calculator,"Cryptocurrency startup Coinbase has launched a new gain/loss calculating tool as part of an effort to help its user base keep up with U.S. tax requirements.  In a blog post published on Tuesday, the firm explained that the calculator can be used to generate a report which outlines their capital gains (or losses) on its platform, using a first-in-first-out (FIFO) accounting method.  The tool comes with a few caveats, however, namely that it's primarily aimed at users who have bought and sold on Coinbase exclusively – and isn't recommended for those who have purchased digital assets elsewhere or participated in an initial coin offering, per the blog.  ""This tool provides a preliminary gain/loss calculation to assist our customers, but should not be used as official tax documentation without validating the results with your tax professional,"" the startup also cautioned.  Its release follows an earlier step by Coinbase on the tax front, when, in January, the startup reminded its users that they are liable for U.S. capital gains, even going as far as posting a consistent banner about the issue.  The issue of taxation and cryptocurrencies has always been someone of a contentious topic, ever since the U.S. Internal Revenue Service announced in 2014 that it would treat such assets as a taxable form of property rather than, say, a currency.  Concerns over the ambiguity of the IRS guidance – in its new blog, Coinbase itself writes that ""we understand taxes for digital currency can be complicated"" – have fueled complaints from professional circles.  The topic also carries an added degree of weight for Coinbase specifically, which was the target of a lawsuit by the IRS as it sought information on U.S.-based users in an effort to sniff out potential tax avoiders.  Ultimately, the startup would send information on about 13,000 users who had transacted on the platform between 2013 and 2015 after being ordered to by a U.S. district judge in November 2017.

42401220,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcMVMc,1520910011,Japan's Third Largest Utility Tests Bitcoin On Lightning,"Japan's third-largest electricity provider is emerging as one of the first major companies in the world to trial a promising bitcoin payments technology.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Chubu Electric Power Co. has entered into a proof-of-concept with local bitcoin and Internet of Things (IoT) startup Nayuta, one that finds it exploring how bitcoin payments can be made via the Lightning Network, an in-development protocol that promises to cut costs for bitcoin users.  Boasting 15,000 employees and more than 200 power generation facilities, Chubu is now using Lightning to prototype a new way of letting customers pay to charge an electric vehicle.  In a demo of its work, Chubu and Nayuta went so far as to show how a Lightning payment could be sent to an electric vehicle charger that, once paid, instantly turned on and began to energize a real-life vehicle.  Chubu Electric Power Co. senior manager Hidehiro Ichikawa told CoinDesk that the test is part of the company's ""market research"" into how bitcoin could power its IoT needs, though he noted it doesn't yet have any official plans to accept Lightning payments from customers.  In this way, Chubu's story resonates with others enchanted by cryptocurrencies but frustrated by their current capabilties. Of note is that Chubu has been experimenting with bitcoin for IoT for quite some time, but faced a wake-up call when it realized its blockchain isn't as cheap as advertised.  Ichikawa told CoinDesk:  ""Since the electricity charge is small, [Lightning's] necessary to reduce the fees for using public blockchains.""  Nayuta CEO Kenichi Kurimoto believes this test is a signal of something larger – an enterprise interest in using bitcoin to deliver IoT payments in a cost-effective manner with Lightning.  ""For IoT and blockchain applications, real-time payments are needed. We showed that second layer payments can be the solution,"" he said.  Lightning + electricity = <3  But it wasn't just Chubu and Nayuta involved in the test.  To show one way Lightning can work for IoT, the two companies hooked up a Lightning node to an electronic vehicle charger and plugged it into a car. From there they also enlisted Japanese software startup Infoteria, which coded up a mobile app to bring the user experience together.  Once clicking the ""send"" button, the app communicates with the charger over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, which delivers the message and turns the power on.  You can see how it works in the video from Nayuta below:  [video mp4=""https://www.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Video_EV-charging-payment_Nayuta.mp4""][/video]  Notably, the companies involved didn't use real bitcoin in the test, as other ""reckless"" experimenters have been doing recently. Rather, they sent dummy bitcoin on a closed test network that they have more control over.  That detail aside, the test was successful, showing that Lightning can indeed make small, instant payments for electric vehicle charging.  Nayuta spokesperson Hitomi Moriyama went on to say that he believes the same set-up could one day be offered in everyday parking lots. Users could easily use Lightning bitcoin payments to charge up their car, similar to how these chargers are refilled with credit cards today.  ""[Lightning] makes it possible to operate a highly reliable charge management system with a small introduction cost,"" he said.  Impact and outlook  Still, while the test mirrors those that have happened on other blockchains, this one is perhaps notable given the size and scope of Chubu and the continuing commitment of some of the parties involved.  As Ichikawa stressed, Chubu's experiment is still an early proof-of-concept, and he was short on details about how it might affect the company's product as well as how much money it is even pouring into the project.  That said, Nayuta plans to continue to dedicate its entire business to continuing the exploration.  ""We will continue to develop and experiment to seek for what kind of architecture is the best to apply Lightning Network for IoT,"" Moriyama told CoinDesk.  Kurimoto added that Nayuta is now working to ensure compatibility of its software with the three other major Lightning software implementations that are most in use today.  Going forward, Kurimto said he has introduced his team to the Lightning developer mailing list in an effort to work more closely on enterprise applications of the technology.

Just two days after U.S. Judge Jack B. Weinstein of the Eastern District of New York ruled in favor of the CFTC, affirming its definition of cryptocurrency as a commodity, the regulator gave notice of ""supplemental legal authority"" to My Big Coin Pay Inc – a crypto services company it charged with fraud and misappropriation of funds in January.  Weinstein's ruling was the result of a separate fraud case the CFTC is pursuing against a crypto trading scheme called CabbageTech and its operator, Patrick Kerry McDonnell.  Quoting from that ruling, the notice advises My Big Coin Pay that ""virtual currencies 'fall well-within...the [Commodity Exchange Act's] definition of 'commodities'"" and the Commission ""has standing to exercise its enforcement power over fraud related to virtual currencies sold in interstate commerce.""  The CFTC, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the IRS all currently define cryptocurrencies differently and have designated them as commodities, securities and property, respectively.  As for My Big Coin Pay, the Commission alleges that the firm and associated parties Randall Crater and Mark Gillespie misappropriated more than $6 million from their customers, including by transferring customer funds into their personal accounts and subsequently spending the money on personal expenses and luxury goods.  The notice demonstrates that the CFTC's efforts to establish legal precedent are underway, and potentially provides insight into how it will continue to regulate the industry.
