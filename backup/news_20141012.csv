42377690,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX737Rn,1413128679,European Prosecutors Launch Project to Combat Online Dark Markets,"European prosecutors are speaking out about a new pan-European project designed to combat dark markets on the web – and they're addressing bitcoin as a key tool of these illicit bazaars.  The Illegal Trade on Online Marketplaces (ITOM) was initiated by the Dutch Public Prosecution Service, the Openbaar Ministrie.  Kicking off with a meeting in April this year, the project draws together law enforcement from various European countries in an attempt to stop the illegal trade of goods online. Agencies involved include Europol and law enforcement from the UK, Portugal, and Germany.  The project has identified bitcoin as a key pillar supporting illegal trade, and will focus on the digital currency as part of the dark market ecosystem.  Wim de Bruin, a spokesperson for the Openbaar Ministrie, mentioned the value of cryptocurrencies for the global economy, but made a point to address their use in illicit activities:    ""We consider the bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a good addition to the world of economic trade. Sadly though, they seem to provide great benefits for illegal trade, illegal international money transfers and money laundering.      We hope we can stimulate the ‘bitcoin community', as you call it, to help us keep the bitcoin [system] as free of illegal usage as possible. Our ultimate goal is that the bitcoin system will become as self regulating as possible.”    De Bruin added that the organisation was already talking to bitcoin exchanges and banks, among other third parties.  Multidisciplinary interventions  The ITOM held a plenary meeting on ‘multidisciplinary interventions’ in June. Although de Bruin wouldn’t comment on operational matters, a document published by the Ministrie outlining the project’s focus may give clues as to what these interventions are, or who might be targeted for prosecution.  The document outlines what the group sees as the ecosystem for financial trade, breaking it down into seven main steps: obtaining goods, connecting to the Internet, offering goods for sale, contact with buyers, shipment, payment and financial services to deal with the revenues.  It describes the illegal players in these seven steps, including dealers, bulletproof hosting providers, web admins, website sellers and customers and money mules. The document also outlines a list of partners that the prosecutors presumably want to work with in targeting dark markets. These include ISPs, customs, drug prevention groups, logistics services – and, specifically, the bitcoin community.  In a statement to the Dutch Newspaper Volksrant, the Ministrie highlighted the ITOM as an attempt to target international illegal trade by partnering with countries across Europe. It vowed to take down dark markets, and also to focus on mail and logistics services as the delivery mechanism for illegal goods.  The project’s research may stimulate new cryptocurrency policies at an EU-wide level, de Bruin stated:  ""We hope to have a better insight into the effects and necessity of regulations regarding crypto currencies within the EU at the end of the project in 2015. The aim of the project is to advise the European Commission and member states in this matter. With that we also hope to stimulate uniformity between the member states in how they regulate and deal with crypto currencies.""  The prosecutor’s response to Volkskrant also suggested that new legislation may be able to increase visibility into bitcoin transactions.  Not everybody's on board  Some members of the bitcoin community were less than happy with the move, seeing it as a direct threat to their own online activities. Mike Gogulski, original creator of the Ross Ulbricht defense fund, says that he doesn’t use dark markets, but he “supports them 100%”.  ""Let's finally recognize that financial commerce is speech, and that it is speech worthy of all the protections that 'freedom of speech’ attracts,” said Slovakia-based Gogulski, who now runs an online bitcoin laundering service.  In spite of Ulbricht’s arrest and subsequent charges for drug-related crimes, dark market activity is growing. The technology to start such markets is readily available, and encryption makes it difficult for law enforcement to shut them down. Often, authorities must resort to infiltration and shoeleather detective work, which can be resource-intensive.  Jerry Brito  , founder of cryptocurrency policy advisory service Coin Center, said that dark market operators nevertheless face their own challenges:  ""I do think it’s very easy to start one, but then you have to get people to trust you to use that market, and I don’t think that’s easy at all. And I think it’s also difficult to keep the OPSEC [operational security] that you need to be completely impenetrable. So I am not sure I can say right now who’s winning. This is a big challenge for law enforcement.""  Silk Road's alleged founder Ross Ulbricht was arrested after several OPSEC slip-ups that led law enforcement to his door.  The ITOM is currently in the middle of implementing the interventions that it planned in June. This phase will last until March 2015, after which the group will evaluate the results. There will be a concluding seminar on the project in September, and then a final report in December 2015.

42377705,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX737gt,1413118825,Sierra Leone Group Continues Bitcoin Drive to Fight Ebola,"A group of entrepreneurs promoting bitcoin in western Africa has reminded the world of the dire situation it faces as its daily fight to stop the spread of Ebola continues.  The Sierra Leone Liberty Group (SLLG), initially formed to promote free enterprise and libertarian ideals as the path to prosperity in the country, has continued to promote its message despite the frequent need to jump in and assist members' fellow countrymen more directly.  According to leader Mustapha Cole, the group has worked with Ministry of Health vehicles alongside local nurses and has used funds from bitcoin donations to deliver dwindling medical supplies such as disinfectant, goggles and rubber gloves and also to help educate local populations on how to avoid Ebola infection.  Cole said:  ""In Sierra Leone we are suffering from the Ebola outbreak. Every day there is death in my community as people die and food is scarce as the people are quarantined in their homes. Ebola burial teams went on strike due to non-payment of weekly allowances. So we have no faith in the government.""  There is also a need to feed people in villages that have been cut off from the world by quarantine and road blocks. Cole and his group have also used the funds to purchase rice, onions, fish, pepper and oil for delivery.  Ebola continues to spread  The SLLG initially asked for donations via bitcoin to help fight Ebola's spread in August, when there had been only 1,400 deaths. That number has since skyrocketed to over 4,000, and the World Health Organization has warned there could be 20,000 cases by next month without an increase in international assistance.  Cole's effort to introduce bitcoin to the country has two channels: one a straight-up donation drive through his group's website to collect micro-donations from anywhere in the world, and the other to raise money through local entrepreneurs selling their products.  The donation drive has raised a total of 3.173 BTC via two bitcoin addresses on its homepage and Facebook page.  The lack of a functioning bitcoin ecosystem in Sierra Leone means only the sending end of the process is streamlined. The SLLG's American mentor, writer and economist Dan McLaughlin, must facilitate payments by exchanging the BTC amounts to fiat and then transferring to Africa via the traditional, cumbersome remittance channels.  West African bitcoin drive  Despite the daily hardships, Cole still hopes to attend the first regional Bitcoin Seminar in Ghana on 5-7th December.  The conference is organized by Ghana's Dream Bitcoin Foundation (DBF), which shares the principles of the SLLG and believes economic freedom transcending national boundaries is the best way to build African economies.  The DBF's campaign page for the seminar reads:  ""We will also demonstrate to them how bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are the irrepressible tool for Liberty, which will rapidly replace the existing corrupt system that keeps them all in poverty and suppression.""  The DBF is working in conjunction with bitcoin entrepreneurs both locally and from the US. In addition to organizing the conference, the DBF is also experimenting with the idea of its own local cryptocurrency, called Dreamcoin, as a promotional and educational tool.  Both DBF and SLLG hope that cryptocurrency use, bitcoin or otherwise, will streamline local economies as well as open up new markets internationally for local sellers.  Bitcoin donations to the SLLG to help fight Ebola can be made on the group's website.

42377694,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX737O1,1413118210,Why European Retailer Showroomprive Decided to Embrace Bitcoin,"Showroomprive is a Paris-based online shopping website for clothes, cosmetics and household items that offers discounts of 30–70% off of leading brand-name products.  The firm's more than $500m in annual revenue make it one of the leading e-commerce companies in Europe, with figures from 2013 placing it just behind LVMH Moët Hennessy, and the second largest private sales website behind Vente-privee.  These figures could increase, the company hopes, now that it has integrated bitcoin into its payment options.  In an interview with CoinDesk, cofounder and chief executive Thierry Petit said:  “I plan that probably between 5 and 10% of my payments in the next three or four years in Europe will be through the bitcoin system. If there is some additional technology and if some of the big players accept bitcoin then it will accelerate and change the game.”  Showroomprive has an active mobile app platform through which it currently generates more than 50% of its fashion-driven sales. However, at present, it does not accept bitcoin on its apps.  Looking to US leaders  Petit’s business targets consumers that are looking to buy leading brand-name products at the most affordable prices, so being able to offer his customers an additional payment option seemed like “something very disruptive and interesting”.  “For me as founder of the company – I’m an engineer to be honest and I love technology and seeing how it can disrupt our industry,” he said.  Bitcoin first piqued Petit’s curiosity about a year and a half ago, he said, and this year the major US corporations that began integrating it as a customer payments option turned him on a little bit more.  Petit said:  “A few months ago, we noticed that various tests had already been carried out in the United States, for example. More and more well-known e-commerce sites, like Dell or Expedia, have already integrated bitcoin as part of their services. That’s why we were very conscious that it may be a real innovation for our payment strategy. […] That's why I wanted to be very pragmatic, to cut to the solution.”  Showroomprive first implemented bitcoin payments into its operations in the Netherlands because the market was primed for payments innovation.  “As for France,” he added, “we are adopting a practical approach, but we believe that consumer tendencies are evolving. The two are compatible.”  A change of heart  Petit said the learning process has been surprising for him, and that the doom and doubt communicated about bitcoin by so much of the media and financial industries made him wary of the concept – at first.  He said:  “The fact that people are now motivated by bitcoin, they know more or less what it is – this is a really positive point. I was a little bit afraid by bad comments in the ecosystem and it's on the contrary, a lot of people think it’s a great innovation.”  He then turned to the regulatory sphere, where he spoke highly of French senator Philippe Marini and defended his approach to regulating bitcoin activity.  “In France that they want to [regulate] for something positive, and not to kill bitcoin,” he said.  A collaborative economy  Petit spoke to bitcoin’s practical uses and advantages to his business, citing perks like instant transactions and lower transaction fees.  He added that he’s observed a lot of new digital wallet companies and other technology platforms enter into the payments, banking and e-commerce space, and surmised that the growing trend might be the result of an increasingly mobile way of life.  He said:  “One thing that is not disrupted yet is the money. Bitcoin can disrupt the money through several actions – it can give the company immediate transfer, lower commission [...] it’s very interesting in terms of construction and as you can see, a lot of developments, like Airbnb, are coming to this collaborative economy.”  He added: “The payments industry at this time in Europe is like a war [...] maybe bitcoin will have something to play in this industry.”  Image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Tanaya Macheel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/10/12/why-european-retailer-showroomprive-decided-to-embrace-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1a2d151f8269557fcbcadff060d0651f189a43f4-1456x864.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
