42403330,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfmBC,1570663682,WATCH: What Drove Bitcoin's Price Gains Today? We Explore the Pop,"The price of bitcoin (BTC) jumped 5.1 percent on Wednesday – its highest point in two weeks.      The price rise comes after the Federal Reserve (Fed) said it would print money to expand the size of bank reserves – seen as a move by the U.S. central bank that could spark inflation.      Traders said optimism also was buoyed by speculation that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might approve a new bitcoin-based exchange-traded fund (it didn't) and an announcement by UNICEF that it would accept donations of cryptocurrencies.      Joe DiPasquale, CEO of the cryptocurrency hedge-fund firm BitBull Capital in San Francisco, discusses the day's price jump and gives his views on the market outlook.      While the recent market fundamentals may have contributed to an increase in BTC's value, it remains to be seen whether or not that move will sustain throughout the remainder of the week as traders look to sell the news relating to the SEC's latest decision on the Bitwise ETF.      Ricky Li, co-founder and head of Americas at Altonomy – a trading desk and market maker for BTC and altcoin assets – noted that BTC is likely trapped within a defined region until a firm close above a key resistance zone sets the stage for further growth for the remainder of 2019.    “We expect continued range-bound activity between $7,500 and $9000, as sellers will place sell orders at the retest of $9,000 resistance. Only once BTC breaks the $9,000 resistance will it continue the uptrend.”    Sebastian Sinclair contributed reporting.

42387622,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQlvel,1570657511,SEC Rejects Bitwise's Latest Bitcoin ETF Proposal,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has rejected the latest attempt at creating a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).  The SEC announced Wednesday that the ETF proposal, filed by Bitwise Asset Management in conjunction with NYSE Arca, did not meet legal requirements to prevent market manipulation or other illicit activities. The SEC placed the burden on NYSE Arca, rather than Bitwise's proposal itself.  To date, the SEC has rejected all bitcoin ETF proposals, citing market manipulation and fraudulent activity concerns.  The order read:  ""The Commission is disapproving this proposed rule change because, as discussed below, NYSE Arca has not met its burden under the Exchange Act and the Commission’s Rules of Practice to demonstrate that its proposal is consistent with the requirements of Exchange Act Section 6(b)(5), and, in particular, the requirement that the rules of a national securities exchange be 'designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.'""  Bitwise first filed the ETF proposal with NYSE Arca in January 2019, kicking off its most recent push to offer retail customers a regulated bitcoin product. The company sought to be the first firm to launch an ETF in the U.S., alongside competitor VanEck, which filed a similar proposal in January with SolidX and Cboe BZX.  VanEck pulled its version last month.  Bitwise tried to reassure the regulator that issues relating to market manipulation and fraudulent activity could be addressed, publishing a number of reports on what it saw as the “real” bitcoin market and showing that market activity correlated tightly with the regulated bitcoin futures markets.  With Wednesday's rejection, the SEC only has one bitcoin ETF proposal currently sitting before it, filed by Wilshire Phoenix and NYSE Arca.

42403328,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfmCB,1570654211,YouNow Sees Strong Revenue Growth After SEC Approves Token Distribution,"In a disclosure expected to be published Wednesday by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), blockchain-based live-streaming company YouNow reported revenues have grown steadily since the release of its props token in July.  The filing follows YouNow receiving approval from the SEC this summer to distribute its props token under a Regulation A+ qualification, one of the new categories of fundraising created by the JOBS Act of 2012. Besides YouNow, only a handful of crypto firms have chosen the Reg A+ framework to date, including Blockstack.  The filing suggests that regulated token sales can be remunerative in the long term, with YouNow's revenues up 32 percent since the props token was added to the app in July.  ""We expected a lift in business results of up to 10 percent upon providing users with the Token’s utility and then another lift of approximately 10 percent upon exchange listing/liquidity,"" YouNow CEO Adi Sideman told CoinDesk via email, adding:  ""The reality proved significantly better than expected.""  All of YouNow's SEC filings are viewable here, along with its original offering circular here.  It is worth noting, however, that the improved revenues have not yet been adequate to prevent the company from operating at a loss. According to the latest filing with the SEC, YouNow ""is currently working with various venture capital firms and cryptocurrency funds to secure additional capital through the sale of Props tokens and common stock in order to fund its future operations.""  The company, backed by Union Square Ventures and others, has also seen more influencers drawn to the app.  Props is an ERC-20 token that lives on the ethereum blockchain. YouNow's decision to create the token completely changed the company's business model.  Sideman said the Reg A+ framework has proven helpful in validating a long-held belief among many token-backed startups: that consumers hunger to share in the growing value of a network.  ""The SEC allows me to say that you have a potential upside in this network. There's a benefit in that.""  YouNow now  YouNow is an app for people to live-stream their lives.  The most popular users attract large followings, and YouNow makes it possible for fans to express appreciation for these stars by purchasing digital gifts. From a viewer's perspective, these are animated balloons or flowers that explode on the screen when someone buys them. For the talent, though, part of the money spent on the gift becomes earnings.  Gifts are bought on YouNow using an in-game currency called bars, which can be purchased with fiat as an in-app purchase.  Since props went live on YouNow, daily purchases of gifts went up from about $20,000 a day to about $30,000 a day, Sideman said. YouNow has seen a 30 percent increase in daily purchases.  When exchange?  Users can withdraw props to any ethereum wallet, with a built-in integration with Coinbase Wallet that makes it very simple.  However, there's no real market price for props yet because the tokens are not trading on exchanges.  There are still real benefits to holding props, though. First of all, it is a measure of status in the network, which means that a ""like"" or comment from someone with a large number of props influences the application more than those from someone with fewer tokens.  Also, people with a large number of props get a stipend of free ""bars"" every day they are active. In the future, YouNow expects to give large props holders discounts on bars and a higher revenue share for income earned through digital gifts.  Newly distributed props come from the ""protocol rewards engine,"" a smart contract on ethereum that allocates a daily emission of props to apps based on the amount of activity they generate. For now, YouNow is the only app the engine is watching but Sideman says more are coming soon.  Each new app will be able to choose its own methods for allocating its daily props supply. Three apps with over a million users are working on integrating props now, Sideman told CoinDesk.  ""CamFrog and PalTalk are in private beta and expected to publicly launch this quarter,"" he said.  Half of the total supply of props, 500 million tokens, have been set aside for growing the props ecosystem.  Update (Oct. 11, 15:47 UTC): The link to the actual filing has been added to the piece along with additional details on the company's financials.

42403318,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfm1M,1570647645,"Bitcoin Jumps to 3-Week High Near $8,600 as Fed Plans New Round of Reserve Increases","View  The Fed’s decision to expand its balance sheet is seen as a long-term positive development for bitcoin by crypto market experts.  Speculation that SEC might approve ETF application by Bitwise is fueling optimism that more investors could allocate funds to the cryptocurrency.  Prices for ethereum and bitcoin may have gotten a jolt of enthusiasm from an announcement that UNICEF , the United Nations Children’s Fund, would launch a fund to accept donations of bitcoin and ethereum.      Bitcoin (BTC) jumped 5.1 percent on Wednesday to the highest price in three weeks, after the Federal Reserve (Fed) said it would print money to expand the size of bank reserves – seen as a move by the U.S. central bank that could spark inflation.  The top cryptocurrency surged to $8,587.29 as of 19:35 UTC time (3:35 p.m. New York time), according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  Bitcoin suffered a steep drop in late September, tumbling from above $10,000, a move analysts attributed to big margin calls on the Bitmex exchange and disappointment over the debut of a new futures contract on the Intercontinental Exchange's Bakkt digital-asset trading platform.  During the monthly futures contract's first week of trading, it managed to garner just $5 million of total volume, disappointing industry observers who had anticipated a higher uptake from big institutional investors.  But on Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank will soon start expanding its balance sheet again in an effort to avoid a repeat of the recent turmoil in the money markets. Powell said the Fed may have to keep pumping money into the financial markets by buying securities in the coming days in order to ensure the smooth functioning of short-term lending markets.  Joe DiPasquale, CEO of the cryptocurrency-focused investment firm BitBull Capital in San Francisco, said in a phone interview that bitcoin prices typically rise when the Federal Reserve loosens monetary policy – such as earlier this year, when the central bank's first interest-rate cuts in a decade helped push prices to a 2019 high around $12,900 in late June.  ""We know that that has historically helped bitcoin,"" DiPasquale said.  Bitcoin prices have more than doubled from where they started 2019, around $3,700.  There's also speculation in the market that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission might approve a bitcoin-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) from Bitwise, which says on its website that it pioneered the first cryptocurrency index fund.  Matt Hougan, the firm's global head of research, told CNBC on Monday that ""we're closer than we've ever been before to getting a bitcoin ETF approved."" A decision is due by Monday, Hougan said.  ""There's some hope in the industry, which would make it much easier for people to purchase bitcoin,"" DiPasquale said in the interview with CoinDesk.  DiPasquale said he thinks the proposal might be rejected, which could send bitcoin prices back down below $8,000.  Another factor helping to drive prices higher Wednesday, according to Blockforce Capital Chief Investment Officer David Martin, was an announcement that UNICEF , the United Nations Children’s Fund, would launch a fund to accept donations of bitcoin and ethereum, another cryptocurrency.  ""That news broke and that's what's popping in the market today,"" Martin said in a phone interview.  Ethereum surged 6.4 percent to $190.82.  Martin said that ethereum's price started moving prior to bitcoin's surge, perhaps since UNICEF said the first contributions under the new program would come from the Ethereum Foundation.  Some investors and analysts describe the Fed’s latest operation as round four of quantitative easing (QE) – central bank purchases of government securities or other securities from the market to increase the money supply and encourage lending and investment. The Fed conducted three rounds of quantitative easing between 2009 and 2015.  Many observers are of the opinion that the QE programs are inflationary in nature and consider bitcoin as a hedge against such policies.

42403338,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfmJ4,1570643904,MakerDAO's Multi-Collateral DAI Token Is Launching Nov. 18,"MakerDAO is launching a new version of its programmatic stablecoin DAI next month.  MakerDAO Foundation CEO Rune Christensen announced the Nov. 18 launch date at the Devcon ethereum developer conference in Osaka, Japan, on Wednesday.  He said the MakerDAO team has been working toward the launch of multi-collateral DAI (MCD) for five years.  Currently, users of the decentralized financed (DeFi) platform can borrow DAI tokens after committing ETH as collateral. Now, with MCD, users will be able to put up other cryptocurrencies as collateral in the MakerDAO system.  There is a caveat, though.  MakerDAO token holders need to vote on cryptocurrency assets assessed by the MakerDAO Foundation’s Risk Team before being accepted as collateral in the system. The Risk Team is currently evaluating seven cryptocurrencies including prediction market Augur’s REP token and digital advertising platform Brave’s BAT token.  Once it approves new collateral types, MCD will also allow users to earn interest on DAI by locking up a DAI Savings Rate (DSR) smart contract on ethereum.  The DSR allows users to earn a variable return on their DAI holdings “risk-free ... at the protocol level,” in the words of Christensen.  This means any cryptocurrency exchange or application can integrate the DAI Savings Rate into their platforms and that users can begin earning rewards on their DAI holdings.  “We think [this] is going to cause an explosion of new innovative ways to implement DAI,” Christensen said.  Contrasting the DSR with Coinbase’s newly announced rewards program for the dollar-pegged stablecoin USDC, Christensen added:  “The DAI Savings Rate is likely to be higher than the USDC rate but it will also fluctuate. It will depend on the supply and demand of the MakerDAO platform.”  To date, the MakerDAO platform is collateralized by 1.5 million ETH, worth roughly $295 million. Launched nearly two years ago, MakerDAO is now the most popular decentralized financial (DeFi) application on the ethereum blockchain, and it has inspired the creation of several other DeFi protocols including crypto lending and borrowing platforms Compound and dYdX.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAshxmsC4F4  Governance challenges  In spite of MakerDAO’s rise, it has faced several governance challenges.  For example, a lack of voter turnout to ratify decisions made by the MakerDAO community has resulted in delayed changes to the MakerDAO system.  This, though, won’t be an issue for the executive vote needed to ratify and activate MCD on Nov. 18, according to Christensen.  “Depending on what people are voting on, there will be different levels of voter turnout. If you have something that’s extremely important or very controversial, you’ll get a lot of people voting,” Christensen said, adding:  “The thing that’s not completely clear is how quickly these votes will happen, which is why we’ve made sure voting begins on Nov. 15.”  Voting by MakerDAO token holders for ratifying MCD will begin three days in advance of Nov. 18, so MakerDAO Foundation can roll out its newly updated user interface for borrowing MCD tokens.  Still, with a history of such deliberations lasting up to 11 days, this is no guarantee MakerDAO token holders will take action within three.  Christensen hinted at new governance processes for the MakerDAO system to further incentivize and streamline MakerDAO’s voting, which to this point has mostly revolved around ratifying changes to the MakerDAO Stability Fee. These fees play a dual role in theMakerDAO system, both stabilizing DAI to the $1 peg and providing interest on debt taken out against cryptocurrency collateral.  Christensen says DAI’s peg to the U.S. dollar will become “easier [for MakerDAO token holders] to control.”  In the last month, DAI market price presently hovers between $1.02 and $0.99 across different cryptocurrency exchanges and over-the-counter trading desks.

42403331,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfmAD,1570640416,The IRS Just Issued Its First Cryptocurrency Tax Guidance in 5 Years,"The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has published its first guidance in five years for calculating taxes owed on cryptocurrency holdings.  Industry members have been eagerly awaiting the update since May 2019, when IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig said the agency was working on providing fresh guidance. The agency's 2014 guidance left many questions unanswered, and the crypto market has grown more complex in the years since.  As expected, the guidance notice released Wednesday addresses: the tax liabilities created by cryptocurrency forks; the acceptable methods for valuing cryptocurrency received as income; and how to calculate taxable gains when selling cryptocurrencies.  Drew Hinkes, a lawyer with Carlton Fields and the general counsel to Athena Blockchain, told CoinDesk that ""from the tax collector's standpoint, this is the right answer,"" though Certified Public Accountant Kirk Phillips said he was surprised that the guidance basically only addressed forks.  Forks  Resolving a long-standing question, the guidance says new cryptocurrencies created from a fork of an existing blockchain should be treated as ""an ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the new cryptocurrency when it is received.""  In other words, tax liabilities will apply when the new cryptocurrencies are recorded on a blockchain – if a taxpayer actually has control over the coins and can spend them.  The document reads:  ""If your cryptocurrency went through a hard fork, but you did not receive any new cryptocurrency, whether through an airdrop (a distribution of cryptocurrency to multiple taxpayers’ distributed ledger addresses) or some other kind of transfer, you don’t have taxable income.""  James Mastracchio, a partner at Eversheds Sutherland, told CoinDesk that this applies when there is a distinctly different cryptocurrency as a result of the hard fork.  The IRS language might create more confusion, said Jerry Brito, executive director at Coin Center.  ""While the new guidance offers some much-needed clarity on certain questions related to calculating basis, gains, and losses, it seems confused about the nature of hard forks and airdrops,"" Brito told CoinDesk, adding:  ""One unfortunate consequence of this guidance is that third parties can now create tax reporting obligations for you by simply forking a network whose coins you own, or foisting on you an unwanted airdrop.""  Individuals would be assessed income when they receive the asset, Hinkes said.  ""Receipt is defined by 'dominion and control' ... so it's ability to transfer, sell, exchange or dispose of the asset according to this guidance,"" he said. ""The fear is that someone maliciously airdrops and tags you with a giant liability. But [this] fear is a bit oversold because you would only be liable for new income based on the fair market value of the asset when received, and most forks don't start out with a high valuation.""  Phillips said it was possible that an individual with an ethereum wallet, for example, could receive an ERC-20 token from an airdrop without realizing it. Depending on how the token's value fluctuates, this may result in them having to pay income tax on an asset that was worth more when they received it than when they sell the asset.  ""This can happen when coins hit a high water mark of price discovery right after the airdrop event and the heavy selling could sink the price to a level from which is never recovers,"" he said.  The issue has grown more salient in recent years, as fights over protocol changes caused rifts in various crypto communities, leading to splinter currencies like ethereum classic and bitcoin cash.  Holders of the original bitcoin and ethereum could automatically claim a like amount of the new coins, raising the question of whether and under what conditions they would owe taxes on the windfall.  Now crypto holders and their accountants have a roadmap.  Cost basis  The new IRS document also offers long-awaited clarification on how taxpayers can determine the cost basis, or fair market value of coins received as income, such as from mining or the sale of goods and services.  Cost basis should be calculated by summing up all the money spent to acquire the crypto, ""including fees, commissions and other acquisition costs in U.S. dollars.""  A third key issue addressed by the new IRS guidance is how to determine the cost basis of each unit of cryptocurrency that is disposed of in a taxable transaction (such as a sale).  This is an issue because someone might buy bitcoin in multiple transactions over a span of years; when they sold some of it, it was unclear which purchase price to use for calculating taxable gains.  The value of the crypto purchased on an exchange is determined by the amount the exchange sold it for in U.S. dollars. The income basis, in this case, will include commissions, fees and other costs of the purchase.  If the crypto is bought on a peer-to-peer exchange or a DEX, it is possible to use a crypto price index to determine the fair market value. In the words of IRS, this can be ""a cryptocurrency or blockchain explorer that analyzes worldwide indices of a cryptocurrency and calculates the value of the cryptocurrency at an exact date and time.""  When selling crypto, taxpayers can identify the coins they are disposing of, ""either by documenting the specific unit’s unique digital identifier such as a private key, public key, and address, or by records showing the transaction information for all units"" in a single account or address, the IRS wrote.  This information, the document states, must show:  ""(1) the date and time each unit was acquired, (2) your basis and the fair market value of each unit at the time it was acquired, (3) the date and time each unit was sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of, and (4) the fair market value of each unit when sold, exchanged, or disposed of, and the amount of money or the value of property received for each unit.""  The new guidance allows for ""first-in, first-out"" accounting or specifically identifying when the cryptocurrencies being sold were acquired, Mastracchio said.  ""Let's say I bought my first unit at $5,000 and my second unit at $2,000 and then I sold one of my units. I can identify the unit or I can use 'first-in, first-out,'"" he said. ""From a tax planning perspective, you may want to be specific about which unit you sold or you may want to use first-in, first-out because sometimes you want a capital gain and sometimes you might want a loss.""  Other issues  In a disappointment to crypto users who like to spend their coins on everyday purchases like cups of coffee, the IRS specifically said it would not create an exemption for transactions below a certain threshold.  Paying somebody for service will result in a capital gain or loss, which should be calculated as ""the difference between the fair market value of the services you received and your adjusted basis in the virtual currency exchanged.""  Purchases of goods and services were deemed taxable when the IRS issued its original guidance in 2014, which said that digital currencies were to be treated as property rather than currency for tax purposes. This discouraged casual spending and made tax season burdensome for users who wanted to diligently report their obligations.  Nikhilesh De contributed reporting.

While details were sparse, Wednesday's press release noted that Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) has drafted the ""Keep Big Tech Out of Finance Act."" Previously, Waters had called for Facebook to halt development of Libra until lawmakers' concerns were addressed.

42431079,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzdvh,1570633210,"Canada's Blockchain Sector Wants Legal Clarity, New Report Shows","Canadian blockchain companies want to know where their government stands on the crypto space, a new report commissioned by the Canadian Digital Chamber of Commerce (CDCC) shows.  The report  – one of the first to take a comprehensive snapshot of Canada’s blockchain ecosystem – sheds new light on the country’s nascent crypto firms, who appear largely bullish on their own future and are increasingly eager to know if their government feels the same.  Nearly 40 percent of respondents said that “legal and regulatory challenges” were impeding their growth.  Though separate from U.S. regulators and from other global regulatory bodies, Canada's government has been reticent to establish crypto regulations that might conflict with other countries’ laws, said Michael Gord, CEO of Toronto-based MLG Blockchain consulting group.  Instead, Gord described a regulatory gray zone that confounds his consulting group and the legal teams he turns to for advice:  “Often digital asset regulations in Canada are so ambiguous that lawyers cannot give us a yes or no answer. The regulations have not been defined enough for them to be able to.”  Neither the U.S. nor Canada have developed comprehensive definitions for digital assets, and Gord doubts the Canadians will jump ahead: “Even if [Canadian regulators] were to want to create clear regulation, there's a lot of pressure from the SEC” to follow its lead, he said.  Beyond those regulatory concerns, the CDCC report provides a window into a still-developing ecosystem, crunching data on everything from gender disparities in the workforce to the geographic distribution of crypto-mining operations.  It’s a snapshot from 30,000 feet that nobody had thought to take, said Tanya Woods, CDCC's managing director:  “There were a few key pieces missing when I was speaking with policy makers. I couldn’t articulate to them things they were thinking about: Does this create good jobs? Do we have the talent to do this? How big is this thing in Canada?”  To grow Canada’s blockchain footprint, she said, the advocates and policymakers needed to have reliable data. CDCC partnered with Accenture and the Blockchain Research Institute to find it.  Key findings  For one, a vast majority – 96 percent – of Canadian businesses with 500 employees or less have at least considered implementing distributed ledger technology, according to the survey.  About 25 percent of businesses reported spending nothing on blockchain projects in the past five years, though only 11 percent said they’d continue to devote no resources in 2020.  The report found new blockchain businesses going where their off-chain counterparts already dominate. Banking hub Toronto hosts many blockchain trading exchanges; the capital city, Ottawa, sees cybersecurity and government IT firms; and Alberta, the heart of Canada’s petroleum industry, has a proliferation of supply-chain startups.  Women are underrepresented in Canadian blockchain companies, but not by much: they comprised about 42 percent of the average company's respective workforce, serving in roles from marketing to technical development.  That speaks to a wider embrace of women in the Canadian tech sphere, said Justyna Osowska, founder of Women in Blockchain Canada. She told CoinDesk that her year-old nonprofit has been an immediate success; she's even received event funding from the Ottawa city government.  Said Osowska:  ""I didn't even go out to them and say, 'I want funding.' I hosted one meetup, it went well and they came to me saying, 'Hey, we're looking for woman in disruptive technology, we're going to work with you, we'll support you, come and educate.'""  But Canada's biggest winners, the report shows, are the workers in the blockchain space.  They haul in around $98,000 USD, double the average Canadian’s yearly wage.

42431085,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMze5h,1570633031,SEC in Settlement Talks With 'Fraudulent' ICO Organizer Reg Middleton,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced it has entered into settlement discussions with Reggie Middleton, organizer of the $14.8 million Veritaseum (VERI) initial coin offering (ICO).  In a filing with the New York Eastern District Court, published Oct. 2, the regulator said discussions with the defendants have taken place ahead of a pretrial conference.  This announcement comes on the heels of two settlements with the SEC over unregistered digital securities offerings. On Oct. 1, data storage startup Sia negotiated a $225,000 settlement over its $120,000 raise. On Sept. 30, EOS maker Block.One agreed to pay a $24 million penalty on a raise that totaled $4.1 billion.  According to the initial complaint, Middleton claimed VERI tokens were not securities and willingly mislead investors about the token’s potential value. He obfuscated his business plan and at several times referred to the tokens as “software” or compared them to prepaid gift cards to be used on a technological platform.  Middleton was further accused of manipulating the securities’ value post-ICO, and misappropriating at least $520,000 of investors’ money for personal use.  In 2017, Middleton claimed a hacker stole $8 million of funds raised during the ICO. The funds are still missing.  In an emergency action in August, the regulator froze Middleton’s assets and asked the court to ban him from operating a public company or participating in a digital asset securities offering.  On Oct. 8, Magistrate Judge Ramon E. Reyes reschedule the pre-trial conference for Nov. 14, to allow the parties to devote their resources to settlement.    123115947457 by CoinDesk on Scribd    Eastern District of New York Courthouse image by Nikhilesh De for CoinDesk",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/09/sec-in-settlement-talks-with-fraudulent-ico-organizer-reg-middleton,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bd816239f98222adb233d0ec61187dde47c608a3-1500x729.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431076,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzdph,1570629614,Bank of England Sets Out Rules for Libra Launch in the UK,"The Bank of England has finalized a set of principles the Facebook-led Libra cryptocurrency project must adopt before going live in the UK.  Calling the payment network a potentially “systemically important payment system,” the BoE's Financial Policy Committee released the October Financial Policy and Summary report this week.  ""The FPC judges that such a system would need to meet the highest standards of resilience and be subject to appropriate supervisory oversight,"" the committee says in the policy summary.  Significantly, the BoE says it needs access to be able to monitor payment chain information as one of its conditions. The FPC is calling on regulators to use “their powers accordingly” in light of the published principles.  The Libra Association and corresponding reserve of various fiat currencies underpinning the network are of prime importance, a more detailed document continues. Network participants, exchanges listing the Libra coin, and Libra-compatible wallets will also fall under scrutiny.  The committee states:  “The resilience of the proposed Libra system would rely on the stability of not just the core elements of the Libra Association and Libra Reserve but also the associated critical activities conducted by other firms in the Libra ecosystem such as validators, exchanges or wallet providers. This emphasised the need to ensure end-to-end resilience.”  Similar standards for Libra’s launch were discussed by the EU Commission’s finance minister nominee earlier this week. In his hearing, minister Olaf Scholz said the EU would create a regulatory framework for the payment network under his tenure.

42431090,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzeDh,1570626031,Vanguard Developing Blockchain Platform for $6 Trillion Forex Market,"Mutual fund giant Vanguard has partnered with Nasdaq Ventures-backed blockchain startup Symbiont to develop a trading platform for the $6 trillion currency market, the companies said.  With the new platform, Vanguard, which manages $5.2 trillion, aims to lower transaction costs for the trillions of dollars worth of currencies it trades annually by boosting peer-to-peer trading for investors, connecting them directly via blockchain technology.  Symbiont CEO Mark Smith told CoinDesk the company teamed up with Vanguard to build the currency platform, confirming a Bloomberg report that cited an anonymous source.  The platform has been operational for two months and completed its first trades during the time, according to the report.  A Vanguard spokesperson told CoinDesk:  ""Vanguard is currently piloting a project focused on improving the efficiency and reducing risk of FX hedging.""  The new platform is part of the fund manager's commitment to lowering the cost of investing for all investors, the spokesperson said. Neither company would provide further details of the pilot.  The project, if successful, would be another important milestone for Wall Street courtesy of Vanguard, which created the first index fund in 1975.  New York-based Symbiont actually worked with Vanguard on project related to its index funds before the currency trading platform, helping the fund manager in 2017 streamline its index fund data collection process with its patented smart contract technology.  The blockchain firm is focused on its smart contracts platform for institutional applications of its blockchain platform Symbiont Assembly to help build networks where multiple independent entities can share data and logic in real time.  The startup touted that it has been one of the most successful among its peers in the enterprise blockchain space when compared to Hyperledger, R3, Digital Asset and ethereum variants.  “I would argue that we are the only enterprise blockchain solution,” Smith previously told CoinDesk. The others either aren’t really blockchains, have privacy and security shortcomings or haven’t produced anything beyond ideas, he argued.  Symbiont completed blockchain projects for other use cases and partners, including making the mortgage market transparent and more efficient with Wall Street legend Lewis Ranieri and optimizing the syndicated loans market with Ipreo’s Synaps platform.  In January, Symbiont raised a $20 million Series B funding round led by Nasdaq Ventures, with other investors in the round including Galaxy Digital, Citi and Raptor Group.  As part of the Series B investment, Nasdaq Financial Framework, a software company owned by the exchange, set out to integrate Symbiont’s Assembly smart contracts platform to explore new avenues involving tokenization.  Symbiont, founded in 2013, raised a combined $15.4 million from a seed round in 2014 and Series A in 2017. Earlier investors include the blockchain arm of retail giant Overstock and a Chinese software firm Hundsun Technologies, backed by Alibaba CEO Jack Ma.

Senator Brian Schatz (D-HI) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) sent three separate letters Tuesday to Visa CEO Alfred F. Kelly Jr., Stripe CEO Patrick Collinson and Mastercard CEO and president Ajaypal Singh Banga over the firms' participation in the developing network. The three companies are among 27 partners for the project so far.  Earlier this month PayPal dropped out of the Libra Association, just weeks before members are to sign a formal charter on Oct. 14.  In the letters, Schatz and Brown say Facebook, the driving force behind the network, has failed to satisfactorily answer regulatory concerns over terrorism, money laundering, monetary policy and economic destabilization.  At the heart of the senators' argument lay past accusations against the social media giant such as a New York Times article exposing criminal abuse of Facebook’s messenger app.  The letter states:  “It is chilling to think what could happen if Facebook combines encrypted messaging with embedded anonymous global payments via Libra.”  In what could be viewed as threatening language, Schatz and Brown say participating firms such as Visa, Stripe, and Mastercard may see heightened regulatory scrutiny overall as a result of Libra membership.  “If you take this on, you can expect a high level of scrutiny from regulators not only on Libra-related payment activities, but on all payment activities,” they wrote.

42431094,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzeRh,1570618811,Bitcoin Trades Flat Even as Fed Signals Inflation-Boosting Balance Increase,"View  The Fed's decision to expand its balance sheet is seen as a long-term positive development for bitcoin by crypto market experts. However, it hasn't yet buoyed the cryptocurrency's price, which is consolidating around $8,200.  Short-term technical charts are calling a bullish move to the 200-day moving average, currently located above $8,600.  The case for a corrective rally to $8,600 would weaken if prices drop below $7,763, invalidating Monday's bullish candlestick pattern.      Bitcoin (BTC) is lacking a clear directional bias on Wednesday, despite the Federal Reserve's (Fed) plan to restart its inflation-boosting balance sheet expansion program.  The top cryptocurrency is currently trading largely unchanged on the day below $8,200 on Bitstamp and has spent a better part of the last 24 hours consolidating in the narrow range of $8,100 to $8,300.  The cryptocurrency is failing to draw bids even though Federal Reserve's chairman, Jerome Powell, said on Tuesday that the U.S. central bank will soon start expanding its balance sheet again in an effort to avoid a repeat of the recent turmoil in the money markets.  Short-term rates shot up as high as 10 percent in September, threatening to disrupt the overall lending system and forcing the Fed to inject hundreds of billions of dollars via market repurchase agreements (repo operations) to keep interest rates in the intended range of 1.75–2 percent.  Powell said the Fed may have to keep pumping money into the financial markets by buying securities in the coming days in order to ensure the smooth functioning of the ""overnight"" or short-term lending markets.  The markets believe the Fed's latest operation is nothing but round four of quantitative easing (QE) – central bank purchases government securities or other securities from the market in order to increase the money supply and encourage lending and investment. The Fed conducted three rounds of quantitative easing between 2009 and 2015.  Many observers are of the opinion that the QE programs are inflationary in nature and consider bitcoin as a hedge against such policies.  Bitcoin skeptic and CEO of Euro Pacific Capital Peter Schiff tweeted in June that QE is the new normal and will lead to dollar sell-off and hyperinflation.  Travis Kling  , a former equities Portfolio Manager and now the head of a crypto asset management firm Ikigai tweeted earlier today that bitcoin is insurance against irresponsible monetary policies like QE.  The argument has merit as bitcoin's monetary policy is fixed and deflationary in nature – its supply is reduced by half every four years via mining reward halving.  Also, QE creates hyperinflation in financial assets like sovereign bonds, as pointed out by Daniel Lacalle, Chief Economist and Investment Officer at Tressis Gestión – a Madrid-based asset management company.  Fed's purchases of government securities will push up bond prices, triggering a drop in yields, possibly leading to increased investor demand for high-yielding assets like bitcoin.  After all, government bonds in most developed countries are already offering negative yields and bitcoin is the best performing asset of 2019 with triple-digit gains.  And last but not least, the crypto market community believes BTC has an innate intrinsic value like gold, which has a strong positive correlation with the Fed's balance sheet size.  All-in-all, the Fed's decision to expand its balance sheet could be a long-run positive for bitcoin, as tweeted by popular analyst @IvanOnTech.  So far, however, bitcoin has struggled to find takers, as noted earlier. That said, the short-term technical charts continue to call a move higher to $8,600.  Daily chart  Bitcoin created a bullish outside bar candlestick pattern on Monday, warning of an impending a move higher. So far, the follow-through to Monday's bullish candle has been dismal – the cryptocurrency remains below $8,313 (Monday's high).  Even so, the bullish prospects remain intact, as prices are hovering well above the bullish candle's low of $7,763. Further, the MACD histogram has crossed above zero, confirming a bullish reversal.  Meanwhile, the daily line chart is reporting a bullish divergence of the relative strength.  The cryptocurrency appears on track to test resistance at $8,607 (200-day moving average). A UTC close higher would expose the next hurdle lined up above $8,800 and near $9,000.  The short-term bullish case would weaken only if prices find acceptance below Monday's low of $7,763.

A statement from the exchange's subsidiary, SIX Digital Exchange (SDX), on Wednesday indicated that the exchange has partnered with the Swiss National Bank and the Bank of International Settlement’s Innovation Hub Centre on a proof-of-concept for the study.  Part of the effort includes the exploration of technical options such as the digitization of the Swiss franc on the SDX platform and connecting with the Swiss Interbank Clearing System.  SDX expects distributed ledger-based tokenized assets and CBDCs to lower counterparty risk and release financial innovations, according to the announcement.  SIX’s Thomas Zeeb said:  “Our proof of concept on the subject of digital central bank money for financial market participants on DLT platforms will not only provide technological insights. but will also send an important signal to all market participants to take steps to explore DLT technology and digital assets.”  SIX has been notable for its financial innovation, particularly with its listings of numerous crypto-based exchange-traded products.

42431080,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzdxh,1570615259,Banking Giant UBS Goes Live on We.Trade Blockchain for Trade Finance,"Swiss financial giant UBS has started full-fledged transactions on we.trade, a blockchain-based trade finance platform that’s nearing wide adoption by its member banks.  UBS confirmed it went live on we.trade at the beginning of October, facilitating services to small and mid-sized enterprises (SMEs). A spokesperson told CoinDesk:  “We're reaching out to clients on a one-to-one basis to educate them on the new platform and walk them through the process.”  Blockchains offer a shared digital record to the previously paper-based world of global trade, and help reinforce trust between companies executing trade agreements. We.trade focuses on creating a trusted network among the SME clients of European banks. Services include bank payment guarantees and invoice financing, for which the banks charge a fee.  Launched in mid-2018, we.trade is ahead of rivals like Marco Polo, a trade finance blockchain backed by TradeIX and R3 that’s still in the pilot stage. The we.trade platform is now all about commercial adoption and it’s taking a two-pronged approach: attract more banks and onboard more SMEs.  Erste Group of Austria and Spain’s CaixaBank also started pushing through on live transactions this month. And early next year, Eurobank of Greece and the three main banks of the Czech Republic -- CSOB, Komercni, and Česká Spořitelna -- are set to join them. The three Czech banks account for 80 percent of domestic trade in that country.  Ciaran McGowan, general manager at we.trade, told CoinDesk:  “We are starting with a model where the auto settlement product is free in the Czech Republic, to see if a free model for domestic trade generates easy and rapid on-boarding that works for us.”  On Eurobank, Gowan added: “A fascinating element is that in Greece the post-dated check is still very prevalent, so they see the platform as a way to replace that, which is another use story we hadn’t foreseen.”  Société Générale, HSBC, Santander, UniCredit, Nordea, KBC Bank, Rabobank, and Deutsche Bank already use we.trade to settle trade contracts.  The more, the merrier  The banks are encouraging their corporate clients to use the platform, thereby spurring wider adoption. “The accelerated collaboration between these corporates and banks is amazing,” McGowan said.  “We.trade needs more SMEs using the platform,” said Marie-Laure Gastellu, deputy head of trade finance at Société Générale. “To have more SMEs, it also needs more banks to join, not as equity investors, but really users of we.trade. The SMEs we are dealing with are telling us how happy they are to have such an offer and they are also asking us as much as possible to try to convince other banks to join.”  Gastellu said one of SocGen’s clients in France was dealing with a company in Italy which was not on the platform. Following its recommendation, the firm directly opened an account with Unicredit and joined we.trade.  “We.trade is also a great tool to get new relationships for banks,” said Gastellu.  Similar stories are coming out of Scandinavia, where Nordea has built up a we.trade client network across Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland.  For example, a Swedish company that imports limited edition sneakers asked a supplier in Spain to open a business account with Santander so it could sign up to we.trade, said Ville Sointu, head of emerging technologies at Nordea.  We.trade plans to add a new feature to its software allowing clients to invite their partners to its platform. “We can increase the network by creating a mechanism that will allow customers who have signed on and are looking for a counter-party to have a very easy way of saying ‘I want to trade on we.trade with you,’” Sointu says.  Nordea has positioned we.trade as another product in the bank’s portfolio, Sointu explained. This means that rather like a corporate credit card, there are we.trade brochures, customer support and so on. “We have a real landing page for we.trade,” he said, adding:  “One thing you won’t find on that page is the word ‘blockchain.’”  Pricing  Prices to trade on the platform range from $2,000 a month (for the curious early users) to full annual membership license at $175,000. Trialing a project with We.trade costs $75,000 per year.  “Up until now, the shareholder banks had paid $330,000 per annum,” said McGowan. “From talking to other banks, we got a clear message this is too expensive. So we listened.”  The we.trade platform is built by IBM on the open-source Hyperledger Fabric blockchain system, but McGowan plans to bring the tech work in-house soon.  “We are a technology company and we want to build our own capability,"" he said. ""We have a very good working relationship with IBM and they understand that we can’t continually pay for an outsourced team.”  Shipping image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/09/banking-giant-ubs-goes-live-on-wetrade-blockchain-for-trade-finance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cd5d34504b31cf506b922a0e3e74017ec028da93-1500x884.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431089,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzeBh,1570613435,New Libra Fork Will Create Permissionless Stablecoin Free of Corporate Control,"Update (Oct. 11, 14:25 UTC): Subsequent reporting has found that OpenLibra's creator initially misrepresented which parties are involved in the project. Chainlink, Web3 Foundation and Hashed have told CoinDesk their names were used without their permission in the OpenLibra slide deck presented at Devcon. Their names have been removed from this article. Read more here.      Thirty different blockchain companies and nonprofit organizations plan to fork the Facebook-led Libra crypto project to build their own permissionless version, dubbed OpenLibra.  Announced at the ethereum developer conference Devcon by Lucas Geiger, co-founder of blockchain infrastructure startup Wireline, OpenLibra will function as a stablecoin pegged to the actual Libra cryptocurrency. Libra is currently scheduled to go live late next year.  ""We're going to fork the code, fork the community and create a new cryptocurrency called OpenLibra,"" said Geiger during his presentation at Devcon. ""There is no token sale. No equity and no company behind this initiative.""  OpenLibra’s core team includes representatives from blockchain projects including Cosmos, Democracy Earth and others, as well as non-profit organizations such as the Danish Red Cross.  Geiger explained that “a generous grant” from the Interchain Foundation would support OpenLibra research, alongside personal funds. The Interchain Foundation is a non-profit dedicated to supporting Cosmos network development.  “This covers our funding for several months but there are other grants coming in,” Geiger said.  Facebook first unveiled Libra in June, detailing a stablecoin that will be pegged to a basket of fiat currencies and government bonds.  So far, the OpenLibra project has published a permissionless version of the Libra virtual machine on GitHub. Unlike Facebook's Libra, the code computations on OpenLibra, called “MoveMint,” will run atop Tendermint blockchain software specifically designed for use on public blockchain platforms such as Cosmos.  ""Anything running on Facebook's Libra, you can just drag and drop to OpenLibra. Finances will work the same. The code will work the same,"" Geiger told CoinDesk.  Geiger explained that he and others didn’t want “a cartel company with the ethics of Uber and censorship of Visa” to be the sole proprietors of the Libra stablecoin.  Still, Geiger said the idea for Libra and its technology was not only brilliant but “likely to become the currency of the internet.”  Geiger summed up the sentiment, saying:  “In Libra we trust, in Facebook we don’t.”  Looking ahead, Geiger and the rest of the OpenLibra team plan to work on building a robust scheme to oversee the OpenLibra platform.  “This is a governance problem.

42431084,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMze3h,1570611629,Security Token Firm Taps German Developer's $7 Billion Property Pipeline,"Blockchain firm Fundament has landed German real estate giant Bauwens as a strategic investor with $7.35 billion of projects to jumpstart its asset tokenization business.  Fundament CEO Thomas Ermel told CoinDesk that Bauwens acquired 15 percent stake of the firm in cash in September after beginning negotiations for a partnership in May.  Founded in 2017, the Berlin-based blockchain firm issues security tokens on ethereum blockchain to raise money for real estate development.  The company’s $280 million real estate bond token sale opens for both institutional and retail investors on Oct.8.  The token was initially to be backed by five separate construction projects, three in Hamburg, one in Frankfurt and one in the university town of Jena.  Ermel said the firm will also consider including some projects from Bauwens in its real estate portfolio for the token sale.  Bauwens is one of the top three project developers in volume in Germany, with investment in both residential and commercial real estate, including former Unilever headquarter Emporio Tower, one of the most iconic buildings in Hamburg, Germany.  While Bauwens’s massive pipeline will be available to tokenize, not every project from Bauwens fits Fundament’s investment criteria, Ermel said.  He said the strategy pursues a mid-to-long term investment approach for commercial real estate and other properties in seven major metropolitan regions in Germany.  Ermel said:  “We will select the most suitable projects out of the pipeline for our portfolio.”  Fundament co-founder Robin Matzke, a policy advisor to the German government, said Bauwens provides access to a wide range of real estate projects, including the in-demand sub-sectors of hotels, daycare facilities to co-working spaces.  The current portfolio being tokenized includes residential, commercial and hotel properties, totaling more than 680,000 square feet upon completion. The company projects a return on the projects in the mid-to high single digits.  Ermel said that beside the diversity of Bauwens’ real estate projects, the construction giant has a name recognition that attracts major investors who might be reticent to back a blind capital pool for a tokenized property fund.  ""The venture capital arm of Bauwens is already involved with 40 tech firms in the real estate space,"" Ermel said. ""That is one of the reasons why they were very interested in tokenized real estate bonds.""  Fundament became the first firm in July with the approval from Germany’s financial regulator BaFIN to issue regulated tokenized real estate-backed bonds.  In a statement, Alexander Jacobi, managing director of Bauwens digital GmbH, said:  ""We are delighted to announce this partnership with Fundament Group which recently achieved a decisive breakthrough in Germany by securing the first regulated tokenized real estate bond.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TOKEN SALE,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/09/security-token-firm-taps-german-developers-7-billion-property-pipeline,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d7bebf7408563cf9388eccf0e0f52e2416f5be2c-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431081,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMze7h,1570608022,How Anti-Money-Laundering Rules Hinder Libra's Mission to Reach the Unbanked,"This is the second of a two-part series on why non-profits are participating in the Facebook-initiated Libra Association. For the first story in the series click here.      The Takeaway:  The Libra Association is thinking of radical approaches to reach the unbanked in certain locations, including a “step-ladder” approach to know-your-customer (KYC) regulations.  The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) said it is open to working with Libra about potentially building new forms of digital identity.  Libra believes blockchain forensics firms like Chainalysis, Elliptic and Coinfirm will help strengthen the case for ""tiered KYC"" by monitoring wallet profiles and transaction histories.  Non-profits in the Libra Association like Kiva may play a key role.      The organization leading the development of Facebook’s Libra stablecoin is assembling a range of approaches for connecting unbanked people around the world to the proposed blockchain network.  And it all starts with a foundational challenge.  When you use a card or a phone to buy a cup of coffee, a complex system of rules comes down the pipe with that transaction – rules that have checked that you are who you say you are.  Now, imagine you’re a villager in rural Uganda and you have a line of credit with a local shop which runs to $10. It’s hard to see, in spaces almost devoid of infrastructure, how the same class of so-called know-your-customer (KYC) requirements will be applied.  Using digital tools to meet the challenge of identifying and including unbanked people in the global financial system is what Libra and its supporters say is the project’s greatest opportunity.  The scale of that mission is spelled out by Matthew Davie, chief strategy officer at Kiva, a Silicon Valley-based microfinance platform that is one of the Libra Association’s founding social-impact partners.  “We have to see a systems change in how the financial sector works,” he told CoinDesk.  Kiva, which recently announced a partnership with the government of Sierra Leone to use biometrics to assign digital wallets that record transactions on a blockchain, is exploring the concept or tiered KYC, where digital means can be used as a first step to identifying users in situations where government-issued, paper-based identifiers may be scarce. Davie said:  “In the developed world, we haven’t really thought about tiered KYC, because we haven’t had to. All our transactions have been running through banks or through something that has a KYC check. But go to a refugee camp, or go to a rural village in Uganda. You’ll see that like 85% of transactions are under a dollar. How would you possibly KYC those?”  Dante Disparte, head of policy and communications at the Libra Association, also believes the answer to this difficult problem is here, it just needs to be distributed. Citing existing regulatory thinking on tiered approaches to KYC, combined with the transparency of blockchains, Disparte told CoinDesk:  “In terms of KYC requirements, there can be a step-ladder approach, based on the dollar magnitude or the Libra magnitude of an account, where it's a slightly lower barrier at a lower financial threshold and a higher one at a higher financial threshold.”  It’s a concept enormously vitalized by the addition of blockchains, Disparte added.  “It goes back to the function of a blockchain and having a network of nodes validating transactions,” he said. “The tamper-resistance of the whole engine means it just becomes a higher-fidelity model with potential risk-reporting in real time, versus a self-reporting network that relies on competitive banks.”  Pointing out that blockchain is a decade-old technology and that digitally native mobile money such as Vodafone’s M-Pesa has already made a difference to financial inclusion, he said:  “The things Libra brings together are not science experiments any longer. We are trying to take these mature approaches and place them in direct line of sight of financial regulators and policymakers. We are saying financial inclusion and regulatory oversight are not in competition; Libra presents a pathway for the world to move the needle at scale.”  It’s important to remember this is all aspirational, however. To be clear, when Libra Association members will develop their own wallets (including Calibra, Facebook’s wallet), those wallet providers must ensure compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and counter terrorist financing (CFT) requirements and best practices when it comes to KYC checks.  The FATF effect  However, Libra’s ideas regarding a tiered approach to KYC echo the theoretical work done by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The thing that differentiates Libra (and particularly Calibra) is the scale at which it could turn this theory into practice, potentially involving billions of users.  Tom Neylan, senior policy analyst at FATF, told CoinDesk, “Of course we will be open to talking with them [Libra].”  But he also made it clear:  “What we don't want to do is treat them as if they are a special case, when there are other stablecoin proposals out there and other virtual asset providers.”  Picking up on Disparte’s comments, Neylan said tiered customer due diligence (CDD) in conventional financial services with real fiat currencies is something that's only just being implemented by a few countries. “Tiered CDD in a digital context is probably something we will have to look at in the future but we haven't gotten there yet,” he said.  The FATF, which is due to issue draft guidance on digital identity later this month, has issued guidance on CDD and financial inclusion that includes examples from actual practice in Mexico, Uruguay and India.  The type of things involved in tiered CDD, said Neylan, include limited accounts, where users can transact a certain amount of business in a certain period, so X dollars a month, for example; no international transactions; limits of the amount of savings amassed, etc.  Such basic forms of account do not necessarily require a passport or an address, said Neylan adding:  “The things varied from country to country. In places where nobody has documentation, it might be that the village elder will vouch for you.”  The premise here is that with less functionality comes more ongoing monitoring to ensure that users are not breaking the rules, which is something blockchains are putatively quite good at. As such, users can build up a financial profile over time.  “In some cases, building up a good financial profile can suffice for a lot of what you would do through CDD,” said Neylan. “So that maybe is a model that can simply be applied in the digital world as well.”  Forensic accounts  Another sector of the digital world that sees huge opportunity here is blockchain forensics providers, companies like Chainalysis, Elliptic, Coinfirm and others.  A blockchain-based re-thinking of KYC in this context was summed up by James Smith, CEO and founder of Elliptic, who told CoinDesk:  “We don't need to know everything about you if you are just trying to do a $2 transaction. What we have done at Elliptic is try and turn it around and say, ‘Well, you don't necessarily need to know who they are; we are trying to understand whether they are doing something criminal and prevent it if they are.’”  The combination of a Facebook profile or similar, which can be readily matched to the individual’s blockchain-based transaction history, equals a compelling solution, according to Pawel Kuskowski, CEO and co-founder of Coinfirm.  “You need to properly identify the person, get certain key data points like name, surname, address. If you think about Facebook, this is an excellent source of this type of information,” he said. “Actually, [vetted] Facebook profiling would be far better than the best KYC on the market right now.”  The question of how Libra will approach digital identity remains unanswered. However, the white paper contained a brief but portentous statement that an “additional goal of the association is to develop and promote an open identity standard,” adding that “decentralized and portable digital identity is a prerequisite to financial inclusion and competition.”  This snippet left experts in the digital identity space wondering whether Libra might have an entirely new take on digital identity and KYC, perhaps involving something like a Facebook profile in certain unbanked regions where government-issued documentation is scarce.  As always in these cases, the devil is in the details. Saleem Khan, global leader of data innovation at professional services firm Dun & Bradstreet, said a bridge is needed between the physical and digital, concluding:  “Blockchain itself and Libra itself will never solve the issue of, ‘Is this person truly who they say they are?’ That won't happen without physical attestation. You need to know that that person is in fact who they say they are, even if they are unbanked.”  Brady Dale contributed reporting.

42431092,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzeLh,1570604437,"For Non-Profits Working With Facebook, Libra Isn't Such a Crazy Idea","This is one of a two-part series on why non-profits are participating in the Facebook-initiated Libra Association. For the other story in the series click here.      The Takeaway:  Lost in Libra's regulatory limbo has been a discussion of the cryptocurrency's stated intention: to bring the global poor into the modern financial system.  Many non-profits have been working on just this issue for a very long time. To its credit, Facebook recruited a few of most forward-thinking organizations into the association.  Those non-profits who had already seen potential advantages in blockchain technology to better serve their target populations.  Were these do-gooding organizations brought on as mere window-dressing? Women's World Banking and Mercy Corps tell CoinDesk they won't stick around if their missions aren't served by Libra.      Who can unlock true global financial inclusion? Perhaps a Harvard dropout can succeed where so many others have failed.  According to its announcement materials released in June, the top priority for Libra, the stablecoin invented by Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook, is to reach the unbanked. Yet, most of its founding partners are laser-focused on the developed world, such as Uber, Mastercard, Stripe and eBay.  So how does the association expect those who struggle the most with financial access to get their hands on its low-volatility cryptocurrency? The group's four non-governmental organizations (NGOs) might be key.  Among the 27 founding partners (it was 28 before PayPal dropped out of the project last week), there's a small cadre of four non-profits focused on reaching that population: Mercy Corps, Women's World Banking, Kiva International and Creative Destruction Lab.  To date, there have only been hints about how the rollout of the Libra cryptocurrency might actually work – in part because most of the attention since June has been on regulators' general opposition to the project. It's easy to forget that Libra was intended for places like Uganda, Pakistan and Indonesia when its fate is in the hands of the U.S. Congress and Frankfurt.  But the impact partners are cautiously optimistic about Libra's potential and pleased with the association's willingness to give them a full seat at the table, despite the fact that they won't be buying a Libra Coin, the $10 million governance token the rest of the partners are on the hook for.  ""This little group of NGOs ... we're not being set up to be a hood ornament from the inside,"" J. Tom Jones, chief operating officer of Women's World Banking (WWB), told CoinDesk in an interview. ""That was really important from a risk analysis perspective.""  All eyes on Oct. 14  The association is making decisions about how it will govern itself right now, and both partners CoinDesk spoke with say they believe they have a full voice at the table. Libra Association members will gather in Geneva on Oct. 14 to formally ratify the group's charter.  ""If we had been presented the opportunity to join something where all the questions were answered and everything was baked, it probably wouldn't have been compelling to us,"" Jeremiah Centrella, general counsel for Mercy Corps, told CoinDesk in an interview.  For his part, Jones saw no particular danger to his organization in helping get the new cryptocurrency off the ground.  ""Ultimately, Women's World Banking, as well as the other impact partners, we hold the ultimate decision in that we can leave,"" he said. ""I firmly believe if we leave, it sends a big signal.""  Since PayPal's departure, spokespersons for Mercy Corps, Women's World Banking and Kiva all confirmed their plans to remain in the association. Creative Destruction Lab has not replied to CoinDesk's request for comment.  That said, if something did move the organization to leave, Jones promised:  ""It's not like we'd go quietly. If we deem this won't work for us, we'll say why.""  A natural question for impact partners: Are they receiving financial support from Facebook or the Libra Association? Jones declined to comment. A spokesperson for Mercy Corps said, ""There was conversation around grants for actual operation. And that's part of a conversation we're having.""  Mission statements  The Libra Association has limited its impact partners to organizations with at least a five-year track record of financial inclusion programs and a $50 million operating budget.  Mercy Corps and WWB both have a strong emphasis on advancing the financial outcomes of their respective constituencies.  Mercy Corps has always taken a market-driven approach to interventions, Centrella explained. ""By the time Facebook reached out to us, we had already created an executive team working group on distributed ledger technology,"" he said.  Centrella's non-profit has worked on things like microfinance and financial inclusion, seeking community-driven ways to come back from disaster or achieve economic growth. It also put out a white paper in 2017 on the potential for blockchain in the non-profit sector.  But why the early interest? Mercy Corps generally thinks cash is king in helping overcome pressing challenges. It may be more effective than other approaches, but cash has its own challenges.  Cash doesn't work if the entire market has been destroyed, for example. It can also be difficult to physically deliver cash and to do so in a local currency. Plus, it leaves the worst paper trail (which non-profits need in order to document outcomes).  So Libra, therefore, offers hope to address some of the drawbacks of paper currency.  Libra has been constructed using some of the best features of various cryptocurrencies, and it is structured around a proof-of-stake system, one that's very selective about who can participate early on. That architecture has had its troubles recently, but the Libra Association hasn't shown any evidence that it will be rigid about its governance and indicated an interest in opening up participation over time.  WWB's Jones emphasized similar points. His organization helps facilitate micro-finance (the giving of very small loans to very small business owners), rather than acting as the lender itself. This includes providing services, such as insuring short-term loans against default if borrowers need to close up shop for a few days.  And the poorest people of the world are pinched the most acutely by the global financial system's fees.  ""No cost structure,"" Jones said of Libra. ""That is a huge victory.""  Libra could also potentially make the system WWB facilitates work more quickly. For borrowers, he said it could eventually save trips back and forth to the bank, leaving them more time for business. For its insurance business, Libra can allow instant payments of claims.  In fact, the power of this speed came up again and again with both WWB and Mercy Corps.  Centrella offered the most vivid example, saying:  ""Somebody could have a hurricane come through and end up with money in their accounts while it's coming through.""  Influencing the juggernauts  But will Fortune 500 companies follow the advice of the non-profit crowd?  Jones said he's been pleasantly surprised by the way his organization has been treated as full member of the association.  ""At least from my exposure and participation, everything is being done by consensus,"" Jones said.  Centrella noted that Big Tech's efforts to be helpful in the developing world haven't always worked out. Inviting the non-profits to help guide the project provides some assurance against similar missteps.  ""I do work with a lot of corporate partners and I think all of them have the best intentions in what they are doing even if they are extremely removed,"" Jones said. ""One thing I have to say: My continuous interaction with [Facebook blockchain lead] David Marcus with his team, they just continue to demonstrate, in a very passionate way, that they really want to figure this out.""  Through the regulatory maelstrom, Centrella wants the world to let the association take its shot at these problems.  ""I do hope that it will launch and if it does we are quite hopeful that it will have a transformative positive input,"" he said.  And while Jones acknowledged the suspicion directed at Facebook as the lead, he was similarly hopeful, saying, ""All the greatest ideas in the world were told at some point that it's not going to work,"" he said, adding:  ""Why in the world wouldn't we try?""

UNICEF said in an announcement on Wednesday that in a first for United Nations organizations, the Cryptocurrency Fund will receive contributions in cryptocurrency and grant out in the same digital currency form.  The organization added the first contributions to the UNICEF Cryptocurrency Fund come from the Ethereum Foundation and ""will benefit three grantees of the UNICEF Innovation Fund.""  It said the three grantees that will receive the initial donations are Prescrypto, Atix Labs and Utopixar, focusing on the areas of ""prescription tracking, matching investors and those needing funding, and community tokens and engagement.""  Aya Miyaguchi, executive director of the Ethereum Foundation, said in a keynote speech at the DevCon event that 100 ether, worth about $18,000 at its current price, has been sent to the UNICEF via the new partnership.  “This is a new and exciting venture for UNICEF,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “If digital economies and currencies have the potential to shape the lives of coming generations, it is important that we explore the opportunities they offer. ""  “Together with UNICEF, we're taking action with the Crypto Fund to improve access to basic needs, rights, and resources,” Miyaguchi said in the announcement.  The UNICEF Cryptocurrency Fund is the UN children agency's latest push to adopt blockchain technology for its wider goal. Earlier this year, it was in talks with the government of Kyrgyzstan to use blockchain to provide internet access to schools in the country via the so-called Project Connect initiative.  In December last year, UNICEF said it was investing $100,000 in six blockchain startups in order to solve global challenges via blockchain, ranging from healthcare delivery transparency to managing finances and resources.

Billed as “the world’s computer,” ethereum has not lived up to its initial marketing campaign. ConsenSys and a crowd of developers are working at a solution, dubbed ethereum 2.0, to fix the blockchain’s scalability problems.      Leading up to this reboot, the Ethereal Summit served as a progress marker. The community was enthusiastic about what lay ahead.      “It's it's still a bit early but I think we're coming towards a crossroads where we can start to see the maturation of the technology, especially as more enterprises come into the fold,” said Chrissa McFarlane, CEO of Patientory.      Lex Sokolin is one such developer. He joined ConsenSys as co-head of financial technology months prior. Sokolin was specifically attracted to ethereum’s potential to revolutionize banking services.      The point was also echoed by Itzik Yushuvaev, salesman for AlgoZ Liquidity Solution, who sees the amount of developer activity on the blockchain as “a sign of trust in the second system and in the token.”      But it’s not disruption of global finance all the way down.      Marguerite deCourcelle, CEO Neon District, built her yet-to-be-released cyberpunk role-playing adventure on a sidechain off of ethereum, because it offers gamers the ability to accrue actual value through non-fungible tokens while playing.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/09/watch-ethereum-enters-a-crossroads-at-the-ethereal-summit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/50e58bd590d1c0f62d8e605a5e1dee488356fad9-1500x914.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
