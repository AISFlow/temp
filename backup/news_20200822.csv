Given the fixed supply of Bitcoin, this asset hedges against this devaluation.A new Bitcoin rally might just have started as a consequence of its Halving in May. The prior two Halvings were followed by a 12824% and 3103% gain in two years.I believe that buying Bitcoin for 3% of your portfolio with a vision of holding it for five years might be a good strategy.
