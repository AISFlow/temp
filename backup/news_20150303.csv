42378070,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7Lxp9,1425423948,California Bill Proposes License Requirement for Bitcoin Businesses,"A bill introduced to the California legislature aims to bring virtual currency businesses more clearly under the state’s Money Transmission Act.  Penned by Assemblyman Matt Dababneh, chairman of the state’s Banking and Finance Committee, AB-1326 would prohibit virtual currency businesses from operating unless they are licensed by the Department of Business Oversight (DBO) or have received an exemption from the agency.  Similar to the general financial code, license applicants would need to pay a non-refundable $5,000 fee to register; provide certain identifying information; and keep a certain amount of funds in “investment-grade permissible investments”. The definition includes money market funds, state bonds and US government agency securities and excludes virtual currencies.  Chris Ramsey, a spokesperson for Assemblyman Dababneh, indicated that the bill is the result of conversations that resulted in the opinion that existing law did not capture bitcoin, thereby requiring the introduction of clarifying law.  Ramsey told CoinDesk:  “This bill is something that has been in the works in the state for a couple of years, and as the leader of that committee, Matt dedicated himself on the issue and thought it was the right move to make for the state of California at this time.”  AB-1326 also contains a series of exemptions for US agencies, commercial banks and industrial banks, among other financial entities, a measure that has attracted early criticism.  Businesses that have already received a license to operate in California, Ramsey said, would be unaffected by the bill.  Past and future concerns  Ramsey suggested that the bill is the product of ongoing security concerns over activities in the digital currency space, mentioning the public demise of bitcoin exchange Mt Gox in 2014.  “Mt Gox happened a few years back, where a lot of people had virtual currency that they thought was safe. I think the bill is partly a response to things like that,” he said, adding that the monetary provisions of the measure would discourage fly-by-night operations.  Still, he mentioned that it looks toward a time when bitcoin “plays a bigger part of our economy”.  “Whether it’s lending or traditional financial practices that virtual currency will branch out into, this bill would potentially create a mechanism where the state would already be able to handle things like that,” Ramsey added.  Ramsey estimated the bill would not be heard until early April, but that it would likely be updated as part of an ongoing research process.  During this time, Ramsey said that Dababneh and his staff would be in talks with state agencies, relevant industry participants and the DBO, the latter of which is currently engaged in pending efforts to regulate bitcoin businesses.

42378073,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7Lxsv,1425419127,CoinDaddy Launches WHOIS-Style Search Engine for Digital Assets,"A slew of services have emerged in recent months that allow bitcoin enthusiasts the ability to use bitcoin and other digital currencies to create tradeable assets.  Though mostly used by curious technologists today, platforms like Counterparty and NXT allow users to create a set supply of digital assets, tokens that could then be sold to raise funds for a book, event or entrepreneurial endeavor, without requiring a dedicated blockchain and the associated maintenance an altcoin would.  What these systems lack, according to the developer behind crypto 2.0 services provider CoinDaddy, Jeremy ""J-Dog"" Johnson, is a location where these assets can be traded easily, a central database that allows users to tie information to assets and prove their authenticity.  For example, CoinDaddy launched what it calls its WHOIS for assets this week, a blockchain version of the query and response protocols that allow anyone to look up the identities of those who own domain names and Internet assets.  Johnson indicated that this service is part of a larger series of releases that can be compared to structures more than products in that they form the foundation of what he believes will be a robust service that can facilitate digital asset commerce.  He told CoinDesk:  “One of the huge problems we’re already seeing is scammers. You can create ‘petercoin’ and I could create ‘peterscoin’, and no one knows whose coin it is. The only way we get to which is the right one is some type of feedback system.”  Johnson sees CoinDaddy as a step in the direction of such a service, one that includes a number of features that improve the trading of assets on Counterparty and Dogeparty, its two supported protocols.  Features for commerce  CoinDaddy offers an array of features that aim to support asset buyers and sellers.  An early dogecoin miner, Johnson said he was drawn to the concept of digital assets by the project Dogeparty, which built an asset transfer layer on top of the dogecoin protocol. “That was the initial idea behind the site, for me to be able to list my assets,” Johnson said.  To begin, there is its Asset Registration service, where users can register their assets by creating a wallet, naming an asset and provide basic information about that asset.  Asset Enhancement allows you to provide a more advanced description of an asset, enhancing it with website information, categories, social media logins and more.  “The idea behind it here is making it easy to associate information with their assets and tie company names and websites and try to establish that link,” Johnson said, contrasting it with previous versions that were short on actionable information.  For security, CoinDaddy requires registrants to provide proof-of-ownership deposit, meaning new applications need to make a ""tiny"" deposit from an address they claim to own to a CoinDaddy address. Once validated, CoinDaddy retains the deposit.  Spreading the word  In addition to improving the listing quality, CoinDaddy features a number of tools that allow users to make this information more discoverable.  For example, while users can already send out broadcasts on Counterparty or Dogeparty, a process by which users make announcements visible to others in protocol explorers, these messages are limited to a certain number of characters.  Broadcast Enhancement, in turn, allows users to connect information to broadcasts, potentially reaching others interested in the asset.  In the above example, the message is also paired with a unique website that serves as an extended explanation of the CoinDaddy asset.  ""Users can choose to use our custom website tools, or they can choose to just use our enhancement tool and point the asset or broadcast at their own website,"" Johnson explained.  A similar asset transfer and escrow service then helps facilitate commerce between buyers, keeping funds secure on the blockchain until buyers release funds to the seller.  Building blocks  In interview, Johnson sought to paint these features as building blocks, ones that could be developed as the asset transfer ecosystem matures.  For example, he suggested that CoinDaddy will seek to build out a reputation management system to create a “whole feedback system for assets”.  “If someone gets scammed, they can put feedback into our system with our API. Also, if someone tried to do a transaction, we could say if this person is reputable,” Johnson explained.  Free to use already are CoinDaddy’s block explorers, which visualize assets on the Counterparty and Dogeparty protocols. Owning the services provides CoinDaddy with a way to better tap into what its customer base may want as it seeks to expand.  ""By controlling the blockchain viewer sites, we can more easily integrate features into the blockchain viewer and get them out to the masses faster,"" Johnson said.  The Asset WHOIS will be aimed at serious buyers and sellers of digital assets, while hopefully enabling those who may be experimenting with the tech to access these users.  Encouraging real use  Overall, Johnson expressed his hope that CoinDaddy becomes a useful tool for those experimenting with the technology, but he acknowledged that new technologies often attract abuse or suffer from a lack of creativity.  “There are a few projects that are starting to use assets, but the system was meant for people to use assets for anything, like starting an ‘allowance coin’ for parents. Nobody’s building exciting apps like that, that’s where I would like to see it,” he said.  He also noted that the Asset WHOIS service could help enable “squatters” who want to hold on to potentially valuable asset names on the belief they may rise in value like web domains. One advantage is that asset names only require a one-time registration fee.  As for monetizing the service, CoinDaddy is structured to encourage use.  CoinDaddy charges a flat $5 fee for each element of its service – registration, asset enhancement and broadcast enhancement, payable in bitcoin, litecoin or dogecoin, as part of what it calls its “Fair Pricing Policy”.

42378061,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7Lxf5,1425413141,How Rivetz Uses Your Smartphone to Secure Your Mobile Bitcoin Wallet,"A security technology startup is aiming to grab a share of the growing mobile payments market through a blend of hardware-isolated security and bitcoin.      Rivetz develops software that, when released later this year, intends to leverage secure hardware environments embedded in Android-enabled smartphones to manage private keys for mobile bitcoin wallets. The company has partnered with several companies including mobile security firm Trustonic, identity computing solutions provider Intercede and BitPay.      The app will be available to users in the second quarter of this year, and according to Rivetz CEO Steven Sprague the project has garnered interest from several wallet providers including Mycelium and Breadwallet.      Sprague said that bitcoin's use as a mobile payment instrument has greater ramifications for the broader development of trusted computing and the Internet of Things. The company recently demoed its software solution at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.      The question of how bitcoin users protect the all-important private key is an old one. In a recent interview he said:      ""Bitcoin has a huge challenge, which is how do I protect the private key? Trusted computing has spent $5bn on how do you protect the private key.""            Securing mobile bitcoin    Rivetz's software acts as a second layer of security built into the phone itself. The app makes use of the Trustonic Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) – a hardware-isolated security platform built into millions of ARM-based Android devices – to protect users' bitcoin data and application integrity.      The app uses a Trusted User Interface (TUI) for secure PIN entry and display of the users' transaction details. The trusted UI allows the information to be securely configured by the end user and securely controlled by the TEE environment, by verifying the user interface of a mobile device.      When a user makes a transaction, a summary of the transaction is displayed in a new window by the TEE, ensuring that any non-secure applications stored in the rich OS environment cannot tamper with the payment details.      As a user experience, Rivetz presents another authorization layer on top of the steps included in whatever bitcoin wallet is being used. The user can review the address, amount and transaction fee prior to signing the transaction.    Advancing payments    Sprague told CoinDesk that the goal of Rivetz was to appeal to a wide audience of bitcoin users by supporting a full range of wallet partners.      ""The technology will also support multi-sig and hierarchical-deterministic wallets in the near future,"" he added.      Sprague argued that bitcoin as a technology has the potential to reshape how people pay using trusted devices, as well as solve problems that have existed in the digital payments space for years.      ""Hacking money is a really, really, really well-refined science,"" he said. ""It’s not just being developed because bitcoin started. Hackers have been stealing money for a long time.""    The Internet of trust  The idea of securing transactions extends beyond the payment of money, said Sprague, noting that trust plays a central role in the concept of the Internet of Things.  Companies like IBM have drawn from the example of a smart house filled with interconnected appliances when describing how the bitcoin protocol could be used to facilitate device-to-device communication.  According to Sprague, homeowners who use their mobiles device to instruct their smart appliances will need the means to make sure that those appliances are receiving transactions from the proper source, noting:  ""How do I assure that the washing machine is authorized? What if it’s a rogue operator taking over a machine, or some guy who wants to trade soap futures and wants a million washing machines to order too much soap?""  If and when devices come to be used as security mechanisms for the home, Sprague added, owners need a means to identify themselves securely.  ""It's not just about access,"" he said.

42378059,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LxcZ,1425405716,Gallery: CoinDesk Launches 'Expert Briefing' Series,"Wallet numbers are ""BS"" as a way of measuring bitcoin adoption, according to Jeremy Allaire, founder of Circle, the bitcoin buying and storage firm pitched at consumers.  Bitcoin wallets can be easily generated by automated means and for myriad reasons, so their numbers are a poor estimate of bitcoin's popularity, Allaire said during a panel discussion at CoinDesk's first Expert Briefing in London yesterday.  Allaire was joined by Elliptic co-founder James Smith, who agreed that wallet figures are a problematic way of tracking the cryptocurrency's growth.  Smith discussed his firm's efforts in the enterprise side of the bitcoin space, acting as a custodian for bitcoin funds. The London-based firm stores and insures client funds in an attempt to develop into a ""custodian bank"" for the digital currency.  Click below to see a gallery of photos from the Expert Briefing:  The panel was preceded by an update to the State of Bitcoin 2015 report by Garrick Hileman, CoinDesk's lead analyst.  A key point in the updated report is that venture capital flowing into bitcoin companies is dwarfed by funds moving into the wider FinTech ecosystem. Last year, the total amount of funding for FinTech was 10 times greater than the $300m bitcoin startups received from investors.  Hileman's assertion is that the VC-backed bitcoin space is a subset of a larger trend towards disruptive businesses in the financial services world, one that appears to have been triggered by the financial crisis of 2008.  ATM-maker General Bytes also installed its latest two-way machine at the event along with a bitcoin-only point-of-sale system for merchants.  All three firms – Circle, Elliptic and General Bytes – were sponsors of the Expert Briefing.  Yesterday's event, held at Google's co-working space Campus, was developed as a way to help technology and finance journalists in London understand the bitcoin economy in greater depth. Journalists from the Financial Times, the BBC, Bloomberg and more attended.  Future Expert Briefings will focus on different parts of the digital currency landscape, ranging from storage technologies to regulation.

42378058,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7Lxdp,1425397602,Europol: Cryptocurrency Serves 'Crime-as-a-Service' Business Model,"Digital currencies are increasingly serving as a money laundering platform for ""freelance criminal entrepreneurs operating on a crime-as-a-service business model"", according to a new Europol report.  The EU's law enforcement agency said that the decline of traditional hierarchical criminal networks will be accompanied by the emergence of individual criminal entrepreneurs, who come together on a project basis.  The report, which identified the key driving factors affecting the EU's criminal landscape, predicted that the role of freelance crime organisers is expected to ""become more prominent"".  It added that individuals with computer expertise are very valuable to criminal organisations and that people with such skills are expected to advertise their services in exchange for payment in cryptocurrencies.  The report continued:  ""Virtual currencies are an ideal instrument for money laundering. In addition to traditional layering methods, cryptocurrencies use specialised laundering services to obfuscate transactions to the point where it is very resource-intensive to trace them.""  Despite acknowledging that digital currencies are generally designed for legitimate use, the analysis stated that their anonymity means that they are ""heavily abused by criminals"".  ""As virtual currencies continue to evolve, it is likely that more niche currencies will develop, tailored towards illicit activity and providing greater security and true anonymity"", it noted, adding that ""the anonymity afforded to the buyer by the use of cryptocurrency may lower the entry barriers for members of the general public to become involved in the online purchase of illegal materials"".  The publication of the report follows on from another study produced by Europol's EC3 cybercrime centre, which detailed that bitcoin was increasingly being used to pay for livestreams of child sex broadcasted over illicit internet sites.

42378066,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7Lxir,1425386206,DigitalBTC Launches Mining Contracts Platform DigitalX Mintsy,"Australian bitcoin company digitalBTC has launched digitalX Mintsy, a new service that allows users to lease their computer processing power for cryptocurrency mining and trade contracts via its online marketplace.  The service allows users with specialised cryptocurrency mining equipment to lease their hashing power to others. Contract buyers are able to apply this computing power across multiple algorithms and mining pools.  Contracts for come in a variety of configurations called 'hashflexs' (100 GH/s, SHA256 algorithm), 'liteflexs' (100 MH/s, scrypt algorithm) and 'xflexs' (100 MH/s, x11-15 algorithm).  Once bought, contracts can be traded on Mintsy's marketplace.  Zhenya Tsvetnenko, digitalBTC's executive chairman, said:  ""We are extremely excited by this new consumer launch. DigitalX Mintsy is a long term investment which supports an integral part of the digital currency ecosystem – transaction verification and processing. This is is the crucial backbone of all digital currencies, including bitcoin.""  DigitalBTC started out as a bitcoin mining company and was notably the first bitcoin firm to be listed on the Australian Securities Exchange. However, its focus shifted to developing alternative products following bitcoin's decline in value.  DigitalX Mintsy is the first of these new products and has received ""over 30,000 pre-enrolments"", according to the company.  Exchange partnership  With the news, DigitalBTC also announced a partnership with exchange Cryptsy, which will ""actively promote digitalX Mintsy to its customer base of over 250,000 registered users"".  Individuals using the digitalX Mintsy platform are now able to deposit their digital coins into their Cryptsy wallet.  The cryptocurrency exchange previously confirmed that it would invest $250,000 in the Australian firm in September last year.  Paul Vernon, Cryptsy CEO, spoke to CoinDesk at the time, saying that the goal of the new platform was to offer the trading community a broad range of investment services.  DigitalBTC has also confirmed plans to launch digitalX Pocket, a mobile application that will give consumers the chance to immediately transfer and settle funds.

42378049,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LxV1,1425378612,"Coinplug Enables Bitcoin Buying at Over 7,000 Regular ATMs","South Korean bitcoin services company Coinplug has enabled bitcoin purchases with credit cards through over 7,000 regular cashpoint ATMs across the country.  As well as being the first to sell bitcoins through ATMs not specifically designed for that purpose, it will be the first credit card to bitcoin service in the country.  The move, which allows customers to pay for Coinplug's prepaid okBitcard service, will make bitcoin available in many of South Korea's highest-traffic locations, including subway stations, convenience stores and busy city streets.  The new service was made possible through a deal with Korean ATM manufacturer Nautilus Hyosung, Korea's largest ATM hardware producer – the world's fourth biggest. The firm currently has 7,000-9,000 active machines in South Korea.  Nautilus Hyosung also produced a bitcoin-specific ATM for Coinplug that has been installed in a cafe in Seoul's Gangnam district since March 2014. The machine allows two-way trades, meaning users can buy or sell bitcoin, but accepts cash only.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Coinplug's Richard Yun said that when signing up new merchants to accept bitcoin, his team found the biggest concern was that bitcoin is too difficult for ordinary people to obtain.  He likened it to Elon Musk's problem with Tesla – many customers are curious about electric cars, but are reluctant to buy them due to the lack of charging infrastructure.  How to buy bitcoins  To use the system, customers select 'okBitcard' from the ATM's greeting screen, enter a phone number and date of birth for identification, insert a credit card and print a paper receipt. The receipt includes a PIN code that can then be redeemed for bitcoin value via Coinplug's smartphone app or the okBitcard site.  The video below demonstrates how it is done:  Like-minded partners  Coinplug CEO Ryan Uhr said agreeing new deals has not been difficult, since its business partners, such as Nautilus Hyosung and online payments provider Galaxia Communications, are also fintech companies that believe in bitcoin's potential.  He said:  ""We could dramatically increase okBitcard sellers because we shared our vision for bitcoin and digital currency for future payment with our partners.""  The ATM service is available for fiat values of 10,000, 30,000 and 50,000 South Korean won (approximately $10, $30 and $50). Coinplug says it has plans to expand the service overseas in the future.  In January, Coinplug began selling okBitcards at over 8,000 7-Eleven convenience stores across South Korea, and plans to expand the scheme to other store chains soon.  Using the service, customers can also buy okBitcards from cashiers over the counter, receiving the same kind of paper receipt with redeemable code. Yun said that okBitcoin physical cards, which will be available off the shelf at stores, are still being printed.
