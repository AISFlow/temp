42426603,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJuNBh,1450732091,Why Big Banks Got Blockchains Wrong in 2015,"Bitcoin evangelist, public speaker and community director of the Counterparty Foundation, Chris DeRose is also a journalist and software developer. In this special feature, he looks into the state of blockchain businesses during 2015 and looks forward to what the future holds.  If one wanted to survey the state of private blockchains in 2015, it would be hard to find a better example than by simply watching the blockchain panel at this year's Innotribe conference.  In front of a large group of finance professionals, ""blockchain experts"" and audience alike agreed that blockchains were the wave of the future – despite a complete lack of consensus on what a blockchain is. Or even why one is needed.  With every year comes a new audience fresh to the field with ambitions to solve all the problems of our day with lockchain. Common to nearly all of this year's blockchain pitches is the odd and previously unsexy efficiency of ""notarization"".  If one reads through the marketing brochures for the private ledger companies, the takeaway would appear to be hinged on the discovery of a great new technology that performs data-checksumming at blistering speeds and in ways that were previously encumbering the entirety of our modern finance industry.  Consider me skeptical.  Notarization was never a feature of blockchains, and had previously been considered one of their greatest 'bugs'. If you ask most bitcoin developers what the most pressing problem is with their blockchain, you're likely to hear that 'fungibility' is its biggest weakness. Fungibility in this case being simply the opposite of regulatory oversight and reporting.  While the headlines are quick to name the support of ""big banks"" in this new application of blockchain technology, it would seem that many of the newcomers are doing what newcomers often do: start their own blockchain and sell tokens.    Unique to this year's entrants is the notion that tokens are bad, but that 'shares' in those peddling blockchains are good. What the difference is between shares and tokens remains murky, but this nuance aside, everyone wants to receive consulting as part of their investment.  If nothing else, the big winners in 2015 may remain those efforts which secured the most funding.  Blockchain propaganda  Computerized settlement, notarization and checksumming is a mature industry that has never before been hampered in its efficiency by anything other than regulation. These regulations are generally very efficient in normalizing risks in the finance sector, and software in the field has performed precisely as well as the regulatory framework allows.  Efforts to enable a regulator's ability to inhibit company operations were previously kept to a minimum, though many in the field would now appear to want to turn this arrangement on its head.  In the hype period leading up to the current state of private blockchains, it was a common refrain that 'selling' the world on the notion of 'the technology behind bitcoin' would be the best way to demonstrate its utility.  Many of the newcomers in 2015 have taken this propaganda to heart, and, in doing so, left out the most important part: risk reduction in settlement amongst untrusted parties.  One would hope that those 'thought leaders' omitting this virtue may end up bearing a lot of the blame when notarization efforts fall short. Whether or not you believe bitcoin is a fad, it would appear that this segment of the market isn't being challenged by any of the newcomers.  Part of the pitch among those in the distributed ledger space would lead us believe that computer databases were the reason why our transactions take so long to process. This extraordinary claim has been met with little resistance by many in the finance world, as the notion that ""blockchains have won"" has seemingly preceded all understandings of what else they're needed for.  But, at the tail end of 2015, such reasoning is just beginning to unravel.  Oddly, the incumbent consumer payment networks appear to be the first to understand the true purpose of blockchains.  American Express led the charge with a sizable round of funding for the innovative regulatory arbitrage company Abra. In close second came Visa with a very interesting (and seemingly well-considered) remittance proof-of-concept of its own.  And just recently, skepticism of the distributed ledger space was put forth by none other than Izabella Kaminska of the Financial Times, who wrote a short and impressive dismissal of this new industry in which the headline alone summarizes it best: ""Psuedo profound buzzword banking revolutions involving coins"".  What does the future hold?  So what can we expect for blockchains in 2016?  Few spaces are as active as this one, and the successes will become obvious. These successes are already found in comparatively older companies such as BitPagos, and Backpage.  New entrants in the space that seem to have best adopted the blockchain's efficiency would include Nitrogen Sports, a bitcoin sportsbook and casino, and the quirky (yet addictive) game BitKong.  Apps which will successfully utilise a blockchain will be successful, not because people want to use blockchains, but because they have to. Even more disruptive apps are on the horizon, and while these apps are certainly ambitious by today's standards, 'disruption' is purportedly what FinTech is all about.  Private blockchains certainly have a future in 2016. However, it's hard to find an industry whose notarisations aren't already well served by humble staples like Archive.org or even Google Docs.  In the world of lockchains, there is no idea quite so unprofitable as an idea whose time has come, and it remains to be seen who, if anyone, will actually be making a profit in the consulting or distribution of this private blockchain software. Furthermore, as this industry matures, incumbent industry players such as Oracle and IBM will likely 'flip the switch' and offer drop-in turn-key solutions of their own.  Private blockchains will be important – but not in the ways this year's adherents have promised. Blockchains will likely increase pressure on regulators to reduce their overhead as regulatory burdens in the settlement industry are rendered redundant.  Similarly, it may simply be the legacy of private blockchains to ""sell regulators on the idea of blockchains"", as banks and payment processors embark upon a more sustainable path towards profitability in the form of regulatory arbitrage.

42426578,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJuFfh,1450720079,Insurance Giant Allianz France Exploring Blockchain Potential,"Earlier this month, blockchain startup Everledger joined the latest class of a startup accelerator owned by insurance and financial services company Allianz France.  Everledger  , which uses a blockchain as a distributed registry for diamonds, is set to work with Allianz France, a subsidiary of Germany-based Allianz, to explore the technology even further.  Sylvain Theveniaud, managing director for the Allianz acceleratorhttps://www.allianz.fr/accelerateur/en/index.html, said in a recent interview that his company sees promise in the blockchain and will work with Everledger to develop proofs-of-concept as part of a research initiative. By doing so, Allianz joins a growing number of mainstream financial firms, including insurers, that are testing the technology for possible applications.  He told CoinDesk:  “The idea is to work with Everledger and make [proofs-of-concept] and use cases that we can experiment with inside Allianz.”  Theveniaud went on to suggest that Allianz France sees the promise of the technology, but doesn't have a clear idea of which use cases would be most relevant to it.  “We think that it’s a good time to start working with Everledger and see what kind of use cases we can develop with them,"" he said.  In addition to the work with the blockchain, Theveniaud framed Everledger’s inclusion in the accelerator alongside five others as way for the company to explore a range of new financial technologies.  Everledger founder and CEO Leanne Kemp said in an email that the insurance market is a key target for the startup, and she has an eye to look beyond the use of the blockchain as a registry for one particular type of asset.  ""Everledger is well placed to advance and apply its accumulated knowledge to assist insurers in the reduction of its core risk and provide a trusted ledger of ownership,"" she told CoinDesk.

42426597,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJuGHh,1450695086,The Top 10 Global Bitcoin Regulatory Developments of 2015,"Not a single month passed in 2015 without some groundbreaking new development in the world of digital currency regulation.  I’ll count down some of the ones that have been most influential on my own practice.  10. New Jersey: The Digital Currency Jobs Creation Act  In June, the New Jersey Digital Currency Jobs Creation Act was introduced into the New Jersey Legislature. 2015 brought us the beginnings of several new state initiatives, but this bill is the first to offer both carrots and sticks to digital currency businesses.  The sticks are modest: Instead of applying for a license, a digital currency business need only register with the state. The carrots are significant: significant tax breaks and fast-tracked operational incentives. (In full disclosure, I was honored to be chosen to draft the text of the act).  As of this writing, the legislation is still being considered in the state.  9. Hong Kong: No Need for Bitcoin Regulation  In March, the Hong Kong government laid to rest some concerns that the jurisdiction would crack down on digital currencies, when it released official guidance stating that bitcoins ""do not pose a significant threat to the financial system"".  Thus, the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury concluded ""there is no need to introduce legislation to regulate virtual commodities trading or to prohibit people from participating in such activities"".  Hong Kong is a local hub of digital currency activity, and this affirmative statement provides much-needed certainty to the businesses operating there.  8. CFTC: Bitcoins are Commodities  Since 2013, we’ve known that, for the purposes of anti-money laundering regulation, the federal government considers bitcoin to be a currency. But, in September, the Commodity Futures Trade Commission (CFTC) announced its first civil enforcement action against a bitcoin options trading platform, Coinflip.  In doing so, CFTC confirmed what many within the community had long believed: CFTC considers bitcoin to be a commodity subject to its supervision. As a result, Coinflip was liable for failing to register its bitcoin options exchange as a swap facility.  We can now expect CFTC to exercise oversight over bitcoin derivatives as well as mischief in their markets.  7. BSA Audits: FinCEN is Serious about AML Enforcement  If there were any doubt that the US federal government is serious about enforcing its digital currency regulations, 2015 put those doubts to rest. In May, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) announced its first round of Bank Secrecy Act audits of those companies which had registered as money transmitters in digital currencies.  FinCEN delegates its investigative activity for anti-money laundering (AML) violations to the Internal Revenue Service, which – as of this year – is now conducting regular audits of digital currency companies to ensure compliance.  Multiple companies in the space have reported that they are, in fact, under audit.  6. California: A License for Digital Currency Businesses  When it comes to moving money, or when it comes to technology, California is among the most important jurisdictions in the US.  Yet, it has refused to license bitcoin companies, refused to enforce its existing money transmission licensing laws against bitcoin companies operating in the state and refused to interpret how those laws might apply to the bitcoin industry in general.  Finally, in March, the state introduced AB 1326, an act that would explicitly bring bitcoin companies under licensing guidelines.  The bill has passed the California Assembly and will be reintroduced into the California Senate when it reconvenes in 2016.  5. SEC: Some Mining Contracts Are Securities  Just this month, we learned that bitcoin mining contracts can be securities, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  In its enforcement action against Josh Homero Garza and his bitcoin mining company, GAW Miners, the SEC alleged that Garza and GAW were engaged in a Ponzi scheme where they sold contracts called 'Hashlets' to the public.  The agency explicitly alleged that the Hashlets were securities regulated under the Securities Act, and therefore the SEC had jurisdiction over the fraud.  The SEC went out of its way to note that not all mining contracts are securities, and described the particular characteristics of the Hashlets that crossed the line.  4. New York: The BitLicense  If you’ve been following one story in bitcoin law this year, it’s probably been the 'BitLicense'.  The BitLicense is the media-friendly name for an amendment to New York’s money services laws that sought to create a brand new technology license for bitcoin and other virtual currency companies operating in the state.  The BitLicense saga began in 2013, when the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) rolled out the red carpet for the glitterati of the bitcoin industry to offer their testimony on the new proposal.  The project was first welcomed by many as a shining badge of legitimacy for the industry. For some, though, it began to lose its luster in 2015, when it became clear that the language of the license would prove vague and ultimately over-inclusive.  The final license became effective in August of this year.  3. ItBit: An Alternative to the BitLicense  Where some zigged, others zagged.  In addition to offering a BitLicense, New York provided an alternative route to operating legally in the state. In 2015, the NYDFS awarded its first trust charter to a bitcoin business: the bitcoin exchange operated by itBit.  The trust structure puts itBit in a different position than that of a BitLicensee.  For example, where a BitLicense holder could merely take custody of a client’s bitcoins, itBit must act as a fiduciary to its clients, putting their interests above its own.  2. ECJ Bitcoin Sales Are Not Subject to VAT  In October, the European Court of Justice ruled definitively that sales of bitcoin are exempt from VAT. Following an initial dispute between a member of the bitcoin community and Sweden’s tax office, the European court first addressed the bitcoin taxation issue in June of last year.  The matter was elevated to the European court after a Swedish court found against the tax office and ruled bitcoin transactions there should be exempt from VAT.  Had the court decided otherwise, retail bitcoin activity might have been all but snuffed out in Europe.  1. UK Treasury: AML Rules for Wallets and Prudential Regulations for Exchanges  It may be a controversial call, but I believe the most important regulatory development of 2015 came from the UK.  In response to a call for comments, the UK Treasury announced in March that it plans to require digital currency exchanges in the UK to implement AML standards similar to other regulated financial intermediaries.  However, the prudential requirements (like minimum capitalization requirements and bonding) applicable to some financial services companies will only apply to custodial operations, and will be opt-in. Custodians won’t be required by law to satisfy the requirements, but those who do can tout a presumably confidence-inspiring 'seal of approval' developed by the British Standards Institute.  This places UK businesses under a very different – and frankly much more reasonable – regime than their neighbors across the Atlantic.  2016: What to expect?  If 2016 proves itself even half as interesting as 2015, the industry is in for an eventful year. I can think of at least two developments to anticipate in 2016.  First, I predict we will see a federal Virtual Currency Transaction Report or VCTR. Admittedly, this is more of a report than a prediction, since FinCEN has suggested as much in informal comments.  Currently, bitcoin exchanges and custodial wallets must report any cash or coin (paper or metal) transactions above $10,000 in a so-called Currency Transaction Report (CTR). Because few digital currency companies have a brick-and-mortar presence, the industry as a whole files few CTRs.  This represents a blind spot in FinCEN’s financial surveillance. FinCEN has already dropped hints that it is considering extending the CTR requirement to bitcoin. We might see that as soon as this year. It might even be a part of a more comprehensive rulemaking.  Second, we will see states start to make laws concerning not only digital currency businesses, but also blockchain technology businesses. A tremendous amount of capital is flowing into the blockchain tech space.  I believe that states will begin making attempts to capture some of this revenue by offering incentives to businesses to home within their borders.
