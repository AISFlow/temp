42426523,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtPnh,1443564606,"Rogue FBI Agent Searching for Lost Bitcoin, Silk Road Advisor Alleges","A corrupt FBI agent is planning to extort $71m from Silk Road mastermind Ross Ulbricht, according to new allegations from a former Silk Road advisor.  In a forum post issued this weekend and later publicized by Motherboard, Variety Jones, an account understood to belong to one of Silk Road's key advisors, released details of his alleged correspondence with an agent known as 'Diamond'.  In it, he claims the FBI employee – a seasoned extortioner – has obtained a forgotten Silk Road wallet said to contain more than 300,000 BTC ($71.4m), and that he sought to use blackmail and torture as a means to gain custody of the funds.  Though the post was issued by the Variety Jones account, a subsequent investigation by VICE published earlier this month identified the man as a 50-year-old Canadian man named Roger or Thomas Clark.  The FBI agent purportedly contacted Clark due to what he assumed was his inside knowledge of Silk Road, offering to establish a safe house in Singapore for an exchange of information to take place.  The post reads:  ""My back of the envelope calculations for SR [Silk Road] show that there was easily close to 400,000 BTC that wasn't accounted for yet. I certainly don't have it, it's gotta be somewhere, and Diamond is certainly willing to move heaven and earth to get the passphrase for it.""  Clark indicated that the source contacted him months after the now-defunct market's closure, offering to provide tips about law enforcement actions against other online dark markets in exchange for information on the wallet's whereabouts.  According to Clark, the FBI agent was able to provide advance information about the cases against corrupt DEA agent Carl Mark Force IV and Secret Service agent Shaun Bridges, both of whom were charged for crimes in relation to the Silk Road investigation.  Clark claimed that when he tried to distance himself from the offers, Diamond began threatening his safety, as well as the safety of those connected to the website.  ""He would kidnap Ross Ulbricht's sister, or mother, or ideally both. Get a video capable phone in front of Ross Ulbricht, and he'd give up that fucking pass phrase, and Diamond would have them tortured until he did,"" the post reads.  Clark has since told VICE that he has contacted law enforcement agencies in a bid to protect his safety.  The media outlet suggested it is now seeking to verify Clark's claims.

42426531,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtPxh,1443561095,Chinese Auto Giant Wanxiang Plans $50 Million Blockchain Fund,"Chinese conglomerate Wanxiang Group, best known as one of the nation's largest auto parts manufacturers, is investing in blockchain technology through two new initiatives.  First hinted at in a blog post by Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin, Chao Deng, managing director at Wanxiang-owned subsidiary DataYes, confirmed that the company had completed a purchase of 416,000 ETH, the native token on the Ethereum blockchain, in an total investment of $500,000.  The investment, however, is just the first step in a multi-pronged plan that includes establishing two entities dedicated to promoting blockchain technologies. The first, a non-profit called Blockchain Labs, was co-founded by Buterin, BitShares co-founder Bo Shen and Feng Xiao, vice chairman and executive director of Wanxiang Holdings, the company's investment arm.  The Blockchain Labs launch is to be followed by the creation of a $50m venture capital fund that will invest broadly in applications for blockchain technology and for which Wanxiang will be the sole limited partner (LP).  In interview, Chao noted that Wanxiang now has roughly 10 subsidiaries in financial sectors including insurance, banking, futures and asset management, and that the investments provide it with the ability to look for ways to apply blockchain technologies to its business lines.  Chao told CoinDesk:  ""About two years ago, we saw the rise of blockchain technologies, and we started research and we were very optimistic about their prospects. We know that blockchain tech has a wide range of applications. We don't have any specific goals set yet, but we see opportunities.""  Chao confirmed that, despite interpretations of announcements from the Ethereum project, the $50m fund will seek to support ""all crypto 2.0 projects"", a comment echoed by Shen.  ""We maintain an open, transparent and equal spirit. Ethereum is definitely the leading project of crypto 2.0 on decentralized applications at the moment. We would not only say Wanxiang will be the only LP in the fund, neither is Ethereum the only project that will be funded,"" Shen said.  The legal structure for both entities, according to Chao, is currently being established.  Blockchain Labs  According to Shen, Blockchain Labs will promote education about blockchain technologies and invest in research and experiments in the field. The venture is in the process of being registered as a Chinese entity.  As part of the program, Wanxiang will donate $3m, or $1m over the next three years, to fund the project. Half of the funds for the first year, Shen said, were used to purchase Ether.  ""[Blockchain Labs] will promote and give out ETH to community for non-profit purposes such as rewarding for projects that promote education,"" he said.  The name of the $50m fund once legally established may be called Fenbushi, according to Shen, which stands for ""distributed "" in Chinese.  While Chinese in name, Shen said Blockchain Labs is seeking to denominate one-third of its investments Chinese yuan, with the remaining funds being dispersed in US dollars.  Unveiling event  As part of its promotional efforts, Wanxiang is also backing a conference to be held in Shanghai on 15th and 16th October.  Called the 2015 Global Blockchain Summit, the conference will feature guests from Deloitte, Huarui Bank and Shanghai Steel Union, among other institutions. Representatives from the wider bitcoin and blockchain community include Circle VP of trading Joshua Lim, Koinify CEO Tom Ding and Tether CTO Craig Sellars.  Topics will include the use of blockchain technologies in payments, securities trading, digital asset management and global supply chains, which will be discussed in talks and in closed-door sessions.  ""The problem here in China and in many other areas is that many professionals from conventional business don't understand much about blockchain,"" Chao said, adding:  ""We hope to provide an opportunity for them to get to know the tech better.""

42426537,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtQ3h,1443538497,"Citi, HSBC Partner With R3CEV As Blockchain Project Adds 13 Banks","Distributed ledger startup R3CEV has added 13 new banking partners, bringing the total number of banks involved in its activities to 22.  In a release  , R3 revealed Bank of America, BNY Mellon, Citi, Commerzbank, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Morgan Stanley, National Australia Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, SEB, Societe Generale and Toronto-Dominion Bank had signed on to the project.  R3 CEO David Rutter suggested in statements that the startups approach to collaborating with the market to lower the cost of delivering new blockchain initiatives was a factor in the deal.  Rutter said:  ""The addition of this new group of banks demonstrates widespread support for innovative distributed ledger solutions across the global financial services community, and we’re delighted to have them on board.""  As previously noted, R3 will lead collaborations between its members on design, engineering, experimentation and research projects related to blockchain and distributed ledger technology.  With the news, the 13 banks join nine previously announced partners including Barclays, BBVA, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Royal Bank of Scotland, State Street and UBS, which announced support in September.  Global Fabric for Finance  In a separate blog post, R3 director for market research Tim Swanson expanded on the vision for the startup and what it seeks to achieve with its new partners.  Cautioning that he did not speak for the firm, Swanson distanced R3 from bitcoin and cryptocurrency, suggesting that the startup is not working with banks to develop a digital currency and that it is not working with the bitcoin network.  ""Bitcoin solves a set of problems for a niche group of individuals operating under certain security assumptions (eg, cypherpunks not wanting to interface with banks or governments). Regulated financial institutions do not operate under those assumptions, thus axiomatically bitcoin in its current form is highly unlikely to be a solution to their problems at this time,"" he wrote.  Rather, Swanson suggested that R3 was attempting to work with its bank partners to design a new blockchain ledger system tailored for the needs of the banking community and crafted with its input.  He went on to suggest such a network may not need a mining or distributed transaction processing community, but that any efforts would likely seek to be open sourced to the community.  ""After all, a foundation layer this critical would benefit from the collective eyeballs of the entire programming community,"" he wrote.  The post concluded by noting that R3 is currently seeking to hire developers for its initiatives.

42426547,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtQJh,1443528874,DigitalBTC Bows Out of Bitcoin Mining Race,"Australian firm DigitalBTC is bowing out of bitcoin mining to focus on its consumer products, its CEO has said.  The company, which debuted on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) last June, mined 8,600 BTC in its first three months. However, with bitcoin's price down almost 60% since then, its hardware is proving to be less and less profitable.  According to its latest statement, mining operations netted DigitalBTC $6.4m in the 12 months to June 2015, 20% less than the previous year.  CEO Zhenya Tsvetnenko told The Sydney Morning Herald:  ""When we saw the big drop in the value of bitcoin, just like a traditional miner, we had to look for something else to do. We have been slowly winding down our bitcoin mining operations and we will be progressively moving away from using it as a currency.""  Though DigitalBTC – like many others – has been diversifying its product line for some time, this is the first confirmation it will discontinue its mining operations altogether.  The company's new products include private liquidity platform digitalX Direct and AirPocket, a peer-to-peer remittance app. The latter starts its public beta in the US and the Dominican Republic today.  Long on bitcoin  ""As much as we believe that bitcoin as a financial instrument can be a valuable tool, we basically have the opinion that it is going to take longer than we thought,"" Tsvetnenko said.  While miners have been hit hard by the currency's decline eating into margins, consumer-centric companies have also felt the slump.  Last week, payment processor BitPay laid off a number of staff to ""better align with the [industry's] pace of growth"".  Despite bitcoin's value, DigitalBTC – which is listed under Digital CC Limited – still holds a great amount of the digital currency.  According to its report, the company bought $10.1m-worth in Q2, bringing its total purchase over the past year to nearly $29.7m.

42426534,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtPzh,1443526216,Blockchain-Based Digital Cash Platform Raises $1.12 Million,"Safe Cash Payment Technologies, a blockchain-based digital cash platform that will enable consumers to purchase digital tokens in exchange for cash, has raised $1.12m in seed funding.      The San Francisco-based company procured funding from investors including InfoSpace founder Naveen Jain, who said the platform was ""on to a very disruptive idea"".      Speaking to CoinDesk about the platform, which uses a litecoin-compatible private blockchain and is expected to launch early next year – Chris Kitze, the firm's CEO, said:      ""Our platform is a permission-based blockchain that's licensed to and controlled by banks. We are a technology service provider for banks and we don't handle any money – that's up to our bank partners, licensed money businesses and licensed exchanges.""            Collateralised tokens  The digital tokens, Kitze said, are 100% collateralised. ""This means each token that represents $1.00 has exactly $1.00 stored in a bank.""  He continued:  ""For digital currencies that have fiat interchange, they [the digital tokens] have to be created and operated by a bank for legal reasons. It's also possible to create tokens for loyalty or private currencies, and we have been testing this with a company based in Iceland for the past six months.""    When asked about how the transactions would be processed at the point of sale, Kitze said that just like bitcoin, each party would have a secure wallet and the transaction would be recorded on the blockchain.      The recipient, he added, would receive a confirmation in his or her wallet in less than 10 seconds and would then be able to re-send these tokens.    Reducing friction  Kitze believes there is demand for such an offering as there is currently too much friction in small transactions, noting the US banking system's inefficiencies.  There is currently no simple and fast way, Kitze claimed, to send small amounts of cash electronically across borders and between different systems with final settlement in less than 10 seconds.    He continued:      ""That's really what we are targeting – removing the pain and friction from these kind of transactions for consumers and merchants. We think this will open a lot of things that are not possible today.""              Although Kitze declined to reveal the platform's banking partners, adding that these would be disclosed later this year, he claims the platform's focus on the mainstream banking world is what makes it unique.      Ripple and Hyperledger – the latter was acquired by Blythe Masters' firm earlier this summer – he added, could be seen as Safe Cash's main competitors, but Safe Cash, he said, attempts to take things further.      ""While these companies have done a good job to get the technology to where it is today and create awareness, things are about to move from the pioneer to the settler phase,"" he concluded.

42426539,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtQ7h,1443521480,Mexico's Payment Restrictions Now Cover Bitcoin,"Mexico's Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit (SHCP) has clarified its stance on bitcoin, deeming it a means of payment whilst placing a series of restrictions on transactions involving the digital currency.  Following the Bank of Mexico's warning about the use of virtual currencies last year, the SHCP said bitcoin will be subject to the same restrictions placed on some transactions involving cash or precious metals.  A loosely translated version of the statement reads:    ""According to guidelines focused on the risks of virtual currencies issued by Grupo de Accion Financiera Internacional (GAFI), the use of virtual goods on an international level has resulted in a new way of transferring value via the Internet. For this reason, it is necessary to take action on a national level to identify and lessen the risks that any of these instruments be used to launder money or finance terrorism.""              It continues: ""With this in mind, and taking into account the remit of this Administrative Unit, we include virtual goods in the prohibition stated in article 32 of LFPIORPI, so it is forbidden to fulfil obligations, and in general, liquidate or pay, as well as accept payment in virtual goods as stated in the aforementioned article.""    Article 32 of Mexico's LFPIORPIhttp://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/LFPIORPI.pdf – the country's federal law which sets out to prevent and identify operations transacted with illicit goods – states that the use of cash or precious metals to purchase property or goods is prohibited in certain instances.    Among others, one clause notes that neither cash nor precious metals shall be used when buying property equivalent to more than 8,025 times the minimum salary at the time of sale. Additionally, the same prohibition applies to vehicles worth more than 3,210 times the minimum salary.    The LFPIORPI, enacted by Mexico's former president Felipe Calderón, came into law in July 2013.

42426540,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtQ9h,1443515941,The ‘eBay of Latin America’ Announces Bitcoin Plans,"MercadoLibre, Latin America's answer to eBay, has announced it is integrating bitcoin into its payments platform, MercadoPago.  In an email to users, the marketplace said the initiative would keep its merchants ""one foot in the future"".  The region has been tipped as a hotbed for bitcoin as users seek alternatives to their local currency, and easier ways to pay online. However, startups still have various hurdles to overcome.  It's not yet clear when the roll out will occur, nor which of MercadoLibre's 13 countries will be supported.  According to the company, the integration will be subtle – merchants will only know they have been paid in the digital currency via a note in their transaction history.  Like any other transaction, they will be able to cash out from MercadoPago in the payment method of their choice.  eBay links  Founded in 1999, MercadoLibre is the largest e-commerceplatform in the region – last year, it exceeded 120 million users, reporting revenues of $556.5m.  The company was first linked to bitcoin when its former R&D director, Rodrigo Benzaquen, joined the board of Uruguayan bitcoin startup Moneero last September.  Aptly, eBay is the firm's biggest investor, owning over 18% the company's total public stock following a deal in 2001.  eBay CEO John Donahoe has repeatedly hinted at the company's interest in bitcoin over the past two years, though it is yet to take action.  Ebay's former subsidiary, PayPal, began trialling the currency through its Payments Hub last year.
