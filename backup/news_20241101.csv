35494136,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651073,1730502009,"Dogecoin Bollinger Bands Squeezes Tighter Than It Was Before 2021 Rally, What This Means","Dogecoin has had quite an eventful few days in terms of price action, trading volume, trading activity, and interest among investors. Dogecoin led the entire market in inflows, outperforming even Bitcoin in the past week. This momentum has introduced a compelling shift in Dogecoin‚Äôs technical outlook, particularly with the Bollinger Bands on the DOGE/BTC chart. This interesting outlook was highlighted by crypto analyst Tony Severino, who pointed out that the Bollinger Bands have tightened to a degree not seen in years. In fact, Severino notes that the bands are now tighter than they were before Dogecoin‚Äôs rally in 2021. Dogecoin Bollinger Bands Squeeze To Tightest Level Bollinger Bands are widely used technical indicators that mark price volatility boundaries. When the bands narrow, it generally signals low volatility. On the other hand, widening bands indicate high volatility. A squeeze, where the bands move closer together, suggests that the asset is trading within a tight range. In the case of Dogecoin, Severino‚Äôs observation notes that the DOGE/BTC Bollinger Bands are now closer than they‚Äôve ever been on the monthly timeframe. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Completes 12 Weeks Of Bottom Formation, Analyst Says Don‚Äôt Aim Lower Than $4,900 ATH The last the Bollinger bands were at such a squeeze was just before the 2021 rally, which saw the meme coin surge exponentially during the meme coin craze. Going by the history of the Dogecoin-Bitcoin pair, if the outcome plays out like its previous price action, Dogecoin could be on the cusp of a strong rally in the coming months that could even lead to more returns than the 2024 rally. DOGE Breakout From Three-Year Channel As noted earlier, Dogecoin‚Äôs rally over the past few days has been impressive. Particularly, Dogecoin went on a 72% rally to peak at $0.176, its highest point in over six months. This upward momentum allowed Dogecoin to break out of a three-year-long channel pattern on the price chart defined by a downward-sloping upper trendline dating back to the 2021 high. This breakout is significant, as it marks Dogecoin‚Äôs move beyond a key resistance level that had contained its growth since the 2021 peak. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To New ATH Soon? Analyst Who Called $72,000 Surge Reveals What Needs To Happen The likelihood of a Dogecoin rally in the upcoming months has increased massively due to this breakout, although there remains a possibility of a retest. According to a crypto analyst on social media platform X, $2 is a potential peak target if the momentum holds. However, it is important to note that several resistance levels lie between the current price and this ambitious target. Two examples of notable resistance levels are the 2024 high of $0.22 and the all-time high of $0.7316. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at $0.1585, which means it has reversed by about 10% from $0.176 to retest the channel breakout.

35490079,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651085,1730496641,"How To Trade Bitcoin During The US Election, Expert Reveals","As the United States approaches its presidential election on Tuesday, November 5, 2024, the Bitcoin market is bracing for significant volatility. In the lead-up to the election, Bitcoin surged to a high of $73,620 on Tuesday, likely reflecting investor optimism over a potential victory for former President Donald Trump. However, by Friday, the BTC price experienced a correction, dipping to $68,830 amid a more cautious, risk-off sentiment as the election looms. How To Trade Bitcoin During US Election Alex Kr√ºger, an Argentine economist and renowned crypto analyst, shared his strategic framework on how to trade Bitcoin during the US election period via his X account. Kr√ºger outlined scenarios based on possible election outcomes, highlighting that a Trump victory could propel Bitcoin to $90,000 by year-end with a 55% probability, while a win for Vice President Kamala Harris might see Bitcoin settle around $65,000 with a 45% probability. He emphasized that timing will matter: ‚ÄúExpect the move to be fast if Trump wins. Markets rarely waits for laggards on binary events not largely front-run.‚Äù Kr√ºger also noted that the current Bitcoin price, which he anticipated to be in the $65k-68k range leading up to election night, had ‚Äúovershot‚Äù in alignment with the probabilities favoring a Trump victory. He pointed out the uncertainty surrounding the election results, primarily hinging on the Pennsylvania vote count, which could delay the announcement of a clear winner. Related Reading: Bitcoin Set To Gain If Trump Wins, JPMorgan Cites ‚ÄòDebasement Trade‚Äô As Key Factor ‚ÄúIt largely depends on the Pennsylvania count, if it is lopsided or not. It could be as early as Tuesday evening EST, or days later if the count is very tight. The sooner we get clarity, the easier it gets,‚Äù Kr√ºger stated. Regarding market sentiment, Kr√ºger expressed a bullish outlook on equities regardless of the election outcome, unless there is an unexpected ‚ÄúBlue sweep‚Äù where Democrats secure both the presidency and congressional majorities. He explained that ‚Äúequities drag Bitcoin around.‚Äù In his personal investment strategy, Kr√ºger revealed that he is positioned with long spots in Bitcoin and Nvidia, and plans to go long on Solana (SOL) if Trump wins. With this, Kr√ºger is likely betting on a spot Solana Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) approval in the United States. Kr√ºger‚Äôs analysis suggests that the market has partially priced in a Trump victory, anticipating that a Trump administration could bolster the Bitcoin price. ‚ÄúMarkets have partially priced a Trump victory in. We (the market, in aggregate) expect Trump to drive crypto prices higher due to increased regulatory clarity and implementation of pro-crypto policies,‚Äù the analyst wrote. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Hit $200,000 Only If The Dollar Falls? Bitwise CIO Answers Additionally, he expects that Trump‚Äôs focus on increased government spending would stimulate short-term economic growth, positively impacting equities‚Äîa sector closely linked to Bitcoin‚Äôs performance. Conversely, a Harris victory would likely represent a continuation of existing policies, barring a significant Democratic sweep. Kr√ºger concluded: ‚ÄúBased on betting markets and various election forecasting models, Trump‚Äôs probabilities are in the 50% to 63% range. Ergo, it‚Äôs ‚Äúsafe‚Äù to assume a GOP victory is far from being fully priced in. Such a contested setup is common going into elections. That is why I do not expect ‚Äòsell the news‚Äô.‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $70,402.

Rising to as high as $71,400, bitcoin {{BTC}} quickly pulled back to the $69,000 level, down nearly 1.3% over the past 24 hours. Ether {{ETH}} was lower by 0.3% and solana {{SOL]] fell closer to 2%. The broader CoinDesk 20 was off just 0.6%, with cardano {{ADA}} and litecoin {{LTC}} sporting modest gains.  Earlier Friday, the government reported a sizable slowdown in the U.S. employment market, with just 12,000 jobs created in October, the weakest jobs growth since late 2020. This number, however, could be set for a reversal in November or a revision higher as the Bureau of Labor Statistics works out how the flooding in the Southeast may have affected the data. Later, the ISM reported a 16-month low for its Manufacturing PMI survey, the gauge dropping to 46.5 versus 47.6 expected by economists.  The bond market, however, isn't buying the reported weakness, with the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rising six basis points to 4.38%, its highest level in four months.  Checking U.S. stocks, they're off earlier highs but still stronger on the session, the Nasdaq up 0.7% at close and S&P 500 0.4%.

The four-month delay will allow the parties time to hash out a disagreement over expert witness disclosures that began last month, when Judge Katherine Polk Failla of the Southern District of New York (SDNY) ordered the parties to swap information about the expert witnesses they might call upon to testify in the upcoming trial.  Storm‚Äôs legal team, led by Brian Klein at Waymaker LLP, pushed back against Judge Failla‚Äôs order in an Oct. 14 court filing, arguing that such a disclosure would show the defense‚Äôs hand and ‚Äúgreatly prejudice Mr. Storm.‚Äù  In addition to potentially hurting Storm‚Äôs defense, Klein‚Äôs letter to the court suggested that Judge Failla‚Äôs ruling may have contravened one of the federal rules that govern criminal proceedings. Essentially, Klein argued that the government cannot legally compel the defense to disclose the names of its expert witnesses unless the defense has requested the same information from the prosecution. Storm‚Äôs defense ‚Äúintentionally made no such request,‚Äù Klein wrote, in order to keep their witness list private.

42415676,WEE6jQWt4rgJorpzkntxL2,1730491751,Plan a Crypto Mine Near a U.S. Military Base? Expect a Bigger Hassle Now.,"After the U.S. president weighed in to put a stop to a China-tied crypto operation near a nuclear missile base, the Treasury Department has finalized a rule to tighten scrutiny on foreign property near military installations.  The rule will give the U.S. government more authority to review real estate acquisitions like MineOne's bitcoin-mining effort in Wyoming.  Foreign real estate deals near sensitive U.S. military bases will get more government scrutiny under a new rule from the U.S. Department of the Treasury that has emerged after President Joe Biden shut a China-tied crypto mining operation beside a Wyoming nuclear missile base earlier this year.  That business, MineOne, was in the midst of being acquired by the U.S. firm CleanSpark (CLSK) when it ran afoul of the national-security concerns from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).  Read More: Biden Order to Halt China-Tied Bitcoin Mine Beside Nuke Base Came as U.S. Firm Just Bought it  In May, Biden ordered the bitcoin mining facility near Warren Air Force Base to stop operations, citing a threat to national security as it uses foreign-sourced technology. MineOne, which the government noted acquired the property as a business majority-owned by Chinese nationals, set up shop within a mile of the military facility in Cheyenne, which houses Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).  The new rule issued on Friday expands the government's authority to question foreign real-estate deals near a much longer list of military facilities than before.  ""This final rule will significantly increase the ability of CFIUS to thoroughly review real estate transactions near bases and will allow us to deter and stop foreign adversaries from threatening our Armed Forces, including through intelligence gathering,"" Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen said in a statement.",NEGATIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/11/01/plan-a-crypto-mine-near-a-us-military-base-expect-a-bigger-hassle-now,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4010b8ab383ceb14ecea360a8c5f87df5a8050c8-2995x1685.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

35485858,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651061,1730491257,Worldcoin Rejection At $2.1 Sparks Concerns Of Prolonged Downtrend,"Worldcoin‚Äôs recent failure to breach the $2.15 resistance level has put the token under renewed bearish pressure, leaving investors to question if a prolonged downtrend may be unfolding. The $2.15 mark has become a key battleground, with sellers pushing prices lower each time buyers attempt a breakout. As Worldcoin struggles to regain upward momentum, the risk of further declines grows, signaling potential challenges ahead. This article aims to explore the implications of Worldcoin‚Äôs recent struggle at the $2.1 resistance level and evaluate whether it could signal an extended downtrend. Through an analysis of technical indicators and current market dynamics, we‚Äôll assess the possible risks and opportunities for Worldcoin, offering traders insights into what may lie ahead for the token‚Äôs price movement. Technical Indicators Signal Potential For Extended Downtrend On the 4-hour chart, WLD‚Äôs price is exhibiting negative momentum, trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) as it trends downward toward the $1.27 support level. A continued descent toward the $1.27 support suggests that selling pressure is building, and if the support fails to hold, Worldcoin could experience more declines. Also, the 4-hour Composite Trend Oscillator for WLD is showing bearish signals, with the SMA line crossing below the signal lines and approaching the oversold zone, suggesting that sellers are becoming more dominant. As the indicator nears oversold territory, it reflects heightened selling pressure, raising the potential for a downtrend. Related Reading: Worldcoin Gains Upside Momentum: Is A Major Breakout Ahead? On the daily chart, Worldcoin is exhibiting strong downward momentum, characterized by a bearish candlestick pattern following a failed attempt to break through the resistance at $2.15, indicating increased selling pressure and that the asset may continue to drop. Additionally, WLD is currently facing challenges as it attempts to drop below the 100-day SMA, a key indicator that typically signals a pessimistic trend when breached. If WLD manages to close below this level, it could further confirm the negative sentiment in the market, potentially leading to additional selling and a sustained downturn. A detailed analysis of the 1-day Composite Trend Oscillator shows that WLD is likely facing extended losses. The signal line has crossed below the SMA line and is trending downward toward the zero line, indicating a negative shift in momentum. Should the downward trend persist, Worldcoin could encounter significant difficulties in recovering, resulting in a prolonged period of waning price movement. Worldcoin Price Outlook: Will Bears Maintain Control? As Worldcoin encounters heightened downside pressure after being rejected at the $2.15 resistance level, key support zones become crucial to monitor. If bears continue to assert control, they may push the price down to the $1.27 support level. Related Reading: Worldcoin Soars 31%: Will Network Upgrades Push WLD Price Higher? A breakdown below this level could lead to further losses, possibly testing other support levels and intensifying pessimistic sentiment in the market. Conversely, if support holds, it may restore confidence among buyers and create an opportunity for a price recovery.

42415682,WEE6jQWt4rgJorpzkntxT4,1730488612,"With Decentralized AI and Tokenized Ownership, We Can Fight ‚ÄòThe Six‚Äô","The past two days‚Äô share price moves for the six most heavily capitalized companies in the U.S. tell you all you need to know about why we must urgently decentralize the artificial intelligence economy.  The first headlines were that the third-quarter profits and revenue from Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, Meta and Amazon all beat or met expectations. Yet, with the exception of Amazon‚Äôs on Friday, Big Tech‚Äôs shares all sold off in response to their earnings announcements, dragging down with them chip-maker Nvidia, the sixth member of the group, whose quarterly reporting is scheduled a month later.  What spooked investors were some daunting capital expenditure numbers on AI computing power and model development. Alphabet, for one, said it did $13 billion in capex last quarter and expects to do the same in this one while Meta upped its full-year projected spending to $38-40 billion. The giants are in a spending war as each tries to outrace the others toward AI supremacy. Each one of them stands to lose profit margins if it gets out of control.  Let‚Äôs be clear: between them, The Six are booking $1.8 trillion in annual revenues, a number that would put their combined inflows in 10th place of global country rankings if we viewed them as a proxy for national GDP ‚Äì just behind the gross output of Brazil‚Äôs 220 million people. Meanwhile, The Six have a combined market capitalization of $15 trillion, capturing an astounding one third of the entire S&P 500 index. Despite ‚Äì or perhaps because of ‚Äì this unprecedented scorecard, these companies are relentlessly competing for world domination. Doing what great American companies have always done, they‚Äôre unleashing a competitive instinct that, in a normal capitalist economy of diversified goods and services, is the core driver of technological progress.  So, don‚Äôt worry about The Six. Worry about us. Because our problem amid the dizzying advance of AI is definitely not one of a shortfall in technological progress. It‚Äôs that this particular form of technological progress comes with risks to human autonomy and safety. And to mitigate them, the question of who controls AI‚Äôs development and whether their incentives are aligned with the broadest base of humanity is fundamental.  Just as was the case for Alphabet‚Äôs Google, Meta‚Äôs Facebook and Amazon‚Äôs marketplace, the development of these six companies‚Äô large language models (LLMs) and other AI machinery is occurring within closed, black-box systems.They‚Äôve ingested the troves of data we all unwittingly poured into internet sites, and have built highly complex codebases into which no one has visibility. Between them, they dominate all layers of the AI stack: the storage (Amazon Web Services), the chips for computation (Nvidia), the AI models (Microsoft, with its investment in Open AI), the data (Alphabet and Meta) and the devices we use to interact with AI services (Apple). They might be competing with each other, but they form a vertically diversified oligopoly. Or rather, given the undeniable power that their technology can wield over people‚Äôs lives, they‚Äôre an oligarchy. Indeed, the secrecy around the means by which they exercise that power is characteristic of most oligarchical dictatorships.  Toward the latter phase of the Web2 era, people eventually came to understand Bruce Schneier‚Äôs memorable observation that we are not the internet platforms‚Äô customers; we are their products. With that awareness, we‚Äôre now also finally opening our eyes to how these companies have long been incentivized to modify people‚Äôs behavior in unhealthy ways to maximize shareholder returns. It is no longer controversial to talk of the psychological harm done by the algorithms of Facebook, YouTube, Tik Tok and their ilk, which were blatantly designed to exploit dopamine releases to encourage continued, addictive engagement.  When Frank McCourt and I published Our Biggest Fight in March 2024, we were overwhelmed by parents‚Äô horror stories of the harm social media had done to their kids. And then a Harris Poll coordinated by NYU Professor Johathan Haidt found that young people are just as concerned: nearly half of Gen Z wishes that TikTok and X (Twitter) never existed, even as 83% of the same cohort said they spend four hours a day or more on social media.  So, if we now know of the harms, why on earth would we extend the same oligopolistic control structure into the AI era? AI will put the Web2 oligopoly on steroids.  This is why I believe the creation of distributed, collectively owned open-source AI is a vitally important use case for Web3 and blockchain technology. It‚Äôs the only way to avoid the problem of misaligned incentives.  Sure, there are technical challenges, such as the latency that, for now, makes distributed machine learning inefficient, the capacity limits of on-chain data, or the privacy risks inherent to public blockchains. But innovators are already hard at work on outside-the-box solutions to these problems, motivated by the huge economic and reputational payoff promised by overcoming them. And when they do, the inherent information advantages enjoyed by open systems over closed systems will give decentralized AI a fighting chance. Achieve that, and ‚ÄúDeAI‚Äù will represent not only the right moral path but also the economic winner.  Here‚Äôs the rub: time is not on our side. And the fight is heavily lopsided. As cited above, The Six have an unprecedented $15 trillion war chest. In the 2000s, Facebook and Google learned that their high-value share prices gave them a currency with which to relentlessly acquire startups that could either enhance or threaten their dominance. Now, The Six have even greater capacity to buy up and integrate whatever breakthroughs in AI are coming, be it in independent AI agents or more efficient systems of compute. Their financial clout means that the most important innovations, those that offer the best hope for a more decentralized AI economy, are at risk of being subsumed into their centralized system. Remember, they‚Äôre competing with each other and are incentivized to do whatever it takes to win.  To fight their centralized approach, we must flip the paradigm. Orthodox venture capital will never provide anywhere near enough resources for decentralized competitors to take on the big guys. The only way is to supplant equity financing models with full user-owned, token-based systems. In the future, when your home devices provide the compute and deliver your privacy-preserved data into open-source models that are proven to act in your interests, you will earn tokens for that work. And, with that currency, you will pay for all the cool services delivered by your personal AI agent. It‚Äôs a new, distributed financing and payments system for a new, decentralized AI economy. It is the only way.  Yet, to succeed, the crypto and blockchain industry has to reimagine itself. If startup founders see DeAI merely as a new source of get-rich-quick token-pump opportunities, or if the leaders of the Layer 1 platforms now turning to the field are fixated more on applications that temporarily drive up the dollar value of their tribe‚Äôs cryptocurrency rather than on those that address real, economy-wide problems, this movement will fail. To win this fight, this industry must become more interoperable. It must become more collaborative.  This is not to say we should squash the competitive instincts that are vital to innovation. But it is to acknowledge a need for better cross-industry organization. Through collaborative bodies such as the new Decentralized AI Society, different stakeholders can work with each other to advance common interests around standards, reference architectures, taxonomies, policy objectives and open-source, cross-chain protocols that everyone can use regardless of the token they hold. We‚Äôre not building to pump our bags or take our token ‚Äúto the moon.‚Äù We‚Äôre building to create a new decentralized AI economy for the benefit of all humanity.  Come join the fight.

42415698,WEE6jQWt4rgJorpzknty7E,1730488463,"Bitcoin Mining Bans Can Backfire on Climate Conscious Governments, a New Research Finds","Bitcoin mining is often criticized by environmentalists for its intensive energy usage.  A new research paper shows that bitcoin mining bans can actually backfire because they push miners to seek new jurisdictions that rely on fossil fuels to power their grid.  Bans in America and Europe would typically make things worse, while a ban in Kazakhstan would be positive in terms of emissions.  Governments looking to ban bitcoin {{BTC}} mining for environmental reasons should think twice ‚Äî it could backfire.  That‚Äôs the conclusion from a new academic paper by not-for-profit tech research firm Exponential Science, published on Thursday and titled ‚ÄòThe Unintended Carbon Consequences of Bitcoin Mining Bans: A Paradox in Environmental Policy.‚Äô  The paper‚Äôs findings? In some jurisdictions, a blanket bitcoin mining ban can actually trigger an increase in the industry‚Äôs overall carbon emissions, as the affected miners may relocate to new regions with electric grids that rely on fossil fuels.  ""Bitcoin mining has seen a rough couple of years from a PR perspective, with respect to its environmental credentials,‚Äù Juan Ignacio Iba√±ez, one of the paper‚Äôs contributors, told CoinDesk.  ""Although it is true that proof of work mining is an energy-intensive activity, this does not directly translate into carbon emissions or environmental harm.‚Äù  Indeed, it all depends on what the source of energy is. A coal-powered electric grid will obviously produce more carbon emissions than a hydro-powered one. And mining bans ‚Äúcan have the unfortunate effect of driving the industry away from green sources of energy, hence increasing the global emissions from the network,"" Iba√±ez said.  It really depends on the region. According to the team‚Äôs model, a mining ban in Kazakhstan, for example, would reduce the Bitcoin network‚Äôs global annual carbon emissions by 7.63%. The same ban in Paraguay, however, would increase emissions by 4.32%.  Overall, mining bans would be more effective, from an environmental perspective, in countries such as China, Russia, and Malaysia, with Kazakhstan taking the lead in that category. They will backfire, however, in most of the Americas and in Europe, with a special emphasis on Nordic countries and Canada.  But even within the same nation, the situation may vary from region to region. In the U.S., for example, a mining ban in Kentucky or Georgia would likely have a positive impact in terms of emissions, while bans in New York, Texas, the state of Washington, and California would be detrimental.  Interestingly, a similar dynamic is playing out in China. The Chinese government famously banned crypto mining in 2021, but mining models now agree that some Chinese miners, instead of relocating, simply went underground and continued to operate illegally.  The result? The cessation of all mining activity in the province of Xinjiang could still result in a 6.9% reduction in global annual emissions, while a similar move in Sichuan would cause almost a 3.8% increase.  ‚ÄúWhat this underscores is the importance of science-informed regulation,‚Äù Nikhil Vadgama, co-founder of Exponential Science, told CoinDesk. ‚ÄúEmerging technologies such as blockchain are complex systems, and thus regulatory interventions can produce a butterfly effect‚Äù ‚Äî meaning policy decisions can have unintended, far-reaching consequences.  For Iba√±ez, one of the takeaways of the research is that, as an increasing number of bitcoin mining operations come online, new jurisdictions will grow to have an outsized impact on the network‚Äôs total carbon emissions.  ‚ÄúCurrently, our model does not place a large effect on Sweden, but it's a safe bet to think that more and more miners may move there if conditions continue to be so favorable. Other countries such as Iceland and potentially Argentina could enter the radar soon,"" Iba√±ez said.

This massive surge would propel the Pepe price to $0.0000347, marking new all-time highs for the popular meme coin. Analyst Predicts 326% Price Rally For PEPE Sharing a bullish price forecast for the Pepe price on the last day of October, crypto analyst Captain Faibik has predicted that the frog-themed meme coin is set for a substantial price rally between November and December 2025. While specific analysis of this forecast was not fully disclosed, a few critical indicators on the meme coin‚Äôs predicted monthly price movement for Q4 2024 to 2025 appear to support this bullish outlook. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To New ATH Soon? Analyst Who Called $72,000 Surge Reveals What Needs To Happen In the price chart, Captain Faibik highlighted a series of market fluctuations that Pepe is expected to undergo before the end of 2024. According to his forecast, Pepe could see a brief price rally in December, followed by a shift towards bearish trends. Between February and March 2025, the meme coin is anticipated to rally again. This time, however, this price increase is projected to be more explosive, pushing Pepe to significantly higher levels. Furthermore, the potential surge in March is projected to trigger the start of a unique triangle pattern for the price. From April to November 2025. Pepe is expected to enter a prolonged consolidation period marked by slight price increases and declines. Around November and December 2025, Captain Faibik forecasted a substantial 326.64% price rally for Pepe, potentially pushing its price to $0.00003474, possibly even above the $0.00004 mark. This anticipated spike would effectively send the price of Pepe to new all time highs by the end of 2025. Additionally, with Pepe currently trading for $0.0000089, a rally to the $0.00003474 level would result in the cryptocurrency effectively dropping a zero, marking a crucial milestone in its growth trajectory. A jump above $0.00004 would also represent a 349.44% increase from present price levels. Price Action Mirrors Dogecoin‚Äôs 2020 Movements According to crypto analyst Max on X (formerly Twitter), Pepe is experiencing a similar set of price movements to those seen in Dogecoin in late 2020, just before the 2021 bull run. The analyst revealed that this bullish price action is coming just as Bitcoin is on the verge of hitting a new ATH this bull cycle. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Completes 12 Weeks Of Bottom Formation, Analyst Says Don‚Äôt Aim Lower Than $4,900 ATH Max has expressed confidence that Pepe could become the leading meme coin in this current market cycle, much like Dogecoin was during the bull run in 2021.

According to InTheBlock tracking, the Ethereum blockchain remains the leader, accounting for 43% of all active addresses. Tron comes in second, with a 27% share of all active addresses. TON by Telegram is also in the Top 5 list of InTheBlock as of October 1st, and it offers an interesting picture of an increasing user base.

Kusama made the request today in reaction to Buterin‚Äôs recent comment about Shiba Inu‚Äôs rival Dogecoin (DOGE).¬†Buterin: Dogecoin Deserves to be Second Biggest Crypto¬†In a viral video making rounds within the crypto community, Buterin suggested that Dogecoin deserves to be ranked as the second-biggest crypto after Bitcoin.¬†https://twitter.com/teslaran_doge/status/1851095299340607698?s=46The Ethereum co-founder made this suggestion during an interview earlier this week.

In March, Buterin disclosed that SHIB outperformed his expectations, as he initially expected the token‚Äôs price to crash significantly.¬†This prompted him to distribute the remaining tokens from the 500 trillion he received from Shiba Inu‚Äôs pseudonymous founder to charity organizations after burning 410 trillion SHIB.¬†Meanwhile, Shiba Inu is still leaving many crypto enthusiasts stunned with its remarkable progress.

35476946,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=100156,1730475106,Bitcoin Pullback May Signal Buy Opportunity at $62K for 20% Potential Gain to $74K: Analysis,"An analysis has suggested that the recent Bitcoin pullback from $72,680 may indicate a further 16% decline, with a potential V-shaped recovery targeting $74,600. Bitcoin experienced a notable downturn after encountering strong resistance in its attempt to surpass its all-time high. Earlier today, the cryptocurrency fell below the $69,000 mark, following a rally that peaked on Tuesday when BTC surged to $73,600.This abrupt decline saw Bitcoin lose over $3,000 from its peak, though it has since regained some stability. Nevertheless, it remains significantly under the $71,000 threshold.Previous BTC/USD PatternsAmid this recovery, an analyst on TradingView provided detailed observations on the BTC/USD four-hour price chart, focusing solely on price action without technical indicators such as MACD or RSI. The analysis highlighted two recent V-shaped recovery patterns that occurred this year.The September-October instance involved a high of $64,300, followed by a 17% pullback to a low of $54,146. This sequence culminated in a recovery to a new high of $66,114, marking a 23% gain from the low. Bitcoin 4-hour charts TradingView A similar pattern emerged in March when Bitcoin reached a high above $72K before a 16% pullback brought the price down to $61,919. Subsequently, Bitcoin recovered and reached a high of $72,520, representing a 19% gain from the low. This analysis provided the context for understanding the current market structure, where BTC set a high at $72,680 this week.Current Analysis and Expected RecoveryIn the current market structure, the analyst suggested that BTC is expected to pull back 16% from its recent high of $72,680, aligning with past V-shaped recovery trends. This leads to expectations of a potential low near $61,969.According to the TradingView analysis, a price increase of 20% to 21% from this low could complete the anticipated V-shaped recovery, projecting a potential new high at or near $74,600.The recommended strategy for bullish investors includes waiting for a pullback to the $62,000 range before entering a buy or hold trade, targeting a rise to approximately $74,000. This approach suggests potential gains of 20% on an unleveraged position with minimal risk involved.Bitcoin Forecasts from Other AnalystsMarket analyst Ali Martinez offered a separate perspective, emphasizing that Bitcoin‚Äôs current price movements aligned with his forecast. He noted that maintaining support at $69,000 would be crucial for further upward movement. Last month, Martinez noted that if BTC held above $65,000, it could rise to $72,000, dip back to $69,000, and eventually aim for $78,000.With Bitcoin currently testing the $69,000 level, maintaining this support and rebounding as predicted could signify a new phase in its price trajectory, potentially advancing toward the $78,000 target outlined by Martinez.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/01/bitcoin-pullback-may-signal-buy-opportunity-at-62k-for-20-potential-gain-to-74k-analysis/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bitcoin-pullback-may-signal-buy-opportunity-at-62k-for-20-potential-gain-to-74k-analysis,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

This retrace has sparked renewed interest among investors, with top analyst and investor Carl Runefelt sharing a technical analysis that points to a promising setup for accumulation. Runefelt highlights a bullish pattern emerging in ETH‚Äôs price action, indicating that this retracement could be a prime opportunity for long-term holders to accumulate more Ethereum before a potential rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin Consolidates Near ATH ‚Äì Volume Suggests A Big Move Ahead The coming days will be pivotal for Ethereum as the crypto market closely watches Bitcoin‚Äôs attempt to break its all-time highs. Should BTC achieve this feat, it would confirm a new bull run, likely bringing Ethereum. The crypto community is eagerly waiting to see if Ethereum can hold its ground above $2,400 and eventually surpass resistance at $2,820, potentially setting the stage for higher gains. Ethereum‚Äôs current levels and consolidation phase suggest a decisive move could unfold soon, making it a crucial time for ETH‚Äôs trajectory in the broader market cycle. Ethereum Sideways Consolidation Ethereum has been lagging behind Bitcoin and several other altcoins like Solana, which have recently seen more robust price action. This underperformance has drawn attention from analysts and investors alike, including top analyst Carl Runefelt, who recently shared an in-depth technical analysis on X. Runefelt highlights Ethereum‚Äôs current formation around an ascending support level, suggesting that ETH‚Äôs current price could present one of the best accumulation opportunities before a potential rally. Runefelt‚Äôs analysis points to a crucial ascending support level of around $2,450, which has held steady despite Ethereum‚Äôs pullbacks, maintaining a bullish structure. He emphasizes that if Ethereum continues to trend down, this support could be an attractive entry point for long-term investors looking to accumulate ETH while it‚Äôs relatively undervalued. The chart formation suggests a possible price floor, which, if buyers intervene, could catalyze a move toward higher levels. Related Reading: Dogwifhat (WIF) Prepares For A Bullish Breakout ‚Äì Analyst Sets $3 Target On the upside, Ethereum faces a key resistance at $2,800. Runefelt notes that breaking this resistance could trigger a significant upward move, potentially aligning ETH with broader market trends if BTC breaks into new all-time highs. If Ethereum successfully clears the $2,800 level, it would confirm the bullish pattern and likely fuel a surge in price action. This breakout could signal that Ethereum is ready to catch up to Bitcoin and outperform altcoins, creating a more favorable outlook for ETH in the broader market landscape. The next few days will be crucial for Ethereum‚Äôs trajectory as it continues to hold above the ascending support level. Traders and investors are watching closely to see if ETH can break out of its recent underperformance and reclaim its position as an altcoin leader. ETH Technical Details Ethereum is trading at $2,505 after a failed attempt to hold above the 4-hour 200 moving average (MA) at $2,530. This slip below the 200 MA has put ETH in a precarious position as it seeks new demand levels to stabilize the recent retrace. The price is nearing a crucial support level, and breaking below this area could trigger a significant correction, adding considerable downside risk to Ethereum‚Äôs current price action. For Ethereum to avoid a deeper drop, finding support around the $2,450 mark is essential. If buyers step in and manage to keep ETH above this level, it would signal a positive shift in momentum. An even stronger bullish indicator would be if ETH rebounds and pushes above the $2,550 level, which would help restore confidence in the asset and signal a potential recovery phase.

35472982,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=100172,1730474319,"BNB Chain Destroys 1,772,712 BNB Worth $1 Billion in 29th Quarterly Burn","The BNB Chain ecosystem has concluded a fresh quarterly burn, destroying 1,772,712.363 BNB tokens from the available supply. This latest development is the 29th iteration in the series of BNB Chain‚Äôs quarterly burn. At the time of the burn, the approximate value of the total BNB burned was around $1.07 billion. This 1.77 million BNB figure marked a significant increase from the previous quarter's burn. At the time, 1.64 million BNB tokens, valued at approximately $971 million, were incinerated.https://twitter.com/BNBCHAIN/status/1852260130361901319Further Details of the Latest BNB BurnNotably, the latest burn figure comprises two key components. The first part is the Auto-Burn, which accounted for 1,710,142.733 BNB. Meanwhile, the second component reflects an extra burn of 62,569.63 BNB .¬†This amount addressed previous losses some users experienced with BTokens sent to inactive addresses. Notably, these users were repaid through the Pioneer Burn Program. While some of these BTokens were initially miscalculated in prior Auto-Burns, this quarter‚Äôs burn has now rectified that oversight.Furthermore, the report noted that no BNB was burned from the Pioneer Burn Program this time. Following this latest token destruction, BNB now has a total supply of 144,099,981.1 tokens in circulation, with the goal of reducing the supply to just 100 million tokens. Essentially, there are still 43,533,387.84 BNB tokens remaining to be burned.BNB in the BNB EcosystemSince its mainnet launch in April 2019, BNB has evolved from its origins on the Ethereum network to become a key component of the BNB Chain. BNB is the native asset of the BNB Chain ecosystem, facilitating transactions across various platforms, including the BNB Greenfield blockchain and opBNB Layer 2 solutions.Currently, BNB has a market value of $584 and a market cap of $84.22 billion, ranking as the fourth largest crypto asset.To manage its total supply, BNB utilizes an Auto-Burn mechanism, which aims to gradually reduce the total supply to 100 million BNB. The amount burned is determined by BNB's market price and the number of blocks produced on the BSC each quarter.In addition to the Auto-Burn, BNB features a real-time burn mechanism tied to gas fees. BSC validators assess the ratio of gas fees collected in each block, with a portion burned at a fixed rate. Since the implementation of the BEP95 protocol, approximately 242,000 BNB has been burned through this initiative.",POSITIVE,BNB,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/01/bnb-chain-destroys-1772712-bnb-worth-1-billion-in-29th-quarterly-burn/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bnb-chain-destroys-1772712-bnb-worth-1-billion-in-29th-quarterly-burn,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

42415681,WEE6jQWt4rgJorpzkntxYQ,1730472131,Bitcoin at 16: Getting Its Driver's License and Entering a New Era,"On October 31, Bitcoin turned 16 ‚Äî the anniversary of Satoshi Nakamoto publishing the whitepaper that changed financial history. At 16, Bitcoin is no longer just a rebellious experiment; it‚Äôs entering a critical phase where it‚Äôs being tested on a much larger scale. Bitcoin is getting its proverbial driver's license, ready to navigate the open roads of the global financial system. The question is: can it handle the complexities ahead?  Bitcoin has evolved beyond ""digital gold."" Today, it's a foundational piece of global financial infrastructure. 2024 has seen the rise of Bitcoin Layer 2s, Ordinals, and institutional adoption, which shows we‚Äôre at a critical inflection point.  Perhaps the most defining moment of Bitcoin‚Äôs 16th year has been the entrance of institutions. The approval of Bitcoin ETFs, led by financial giants like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Invesco, marked a historic shift. As of mid-2024, these ETFs have collectively attracted over $1.5 billion in assets under management (AUM), providing a significant capital influx into the market. This institutional wave reflects a growing appetite for Bitcoin exposure through traditional financial vehicles. BlackRock alone manages trillions of dollars in assets, and its involvement signals that Bitcoin is no longer seen as a fringe asset but a serious contender in the global financial arena.  So how can Bitcoin maintain its decentralized ethos while absorbing billions in institutional capital? For those of us building on Bitcoin, this is the challenge we face: to keep Bitcoin permissionless and resilient, even as it becomes mainstream.  Layer 2 solutions like Lightning (now five years old) have transformed how Bitcoin is used, in regions with unstable currencies, Lightning has proven to help with payments; however, adoption in developed markets has been slower than many anticipated.  This slower-than-expected adoption shouldn‚Äôt be seen as a failure but rather as a reflection of Bitcoin‚Äôs maturing role as a broader infrastructure layer. In fact, this shift from immediate use cases like payments to longer-term infrastructure development is arguably a positive sign.  For a majority of the world, we're in a new era where we've separated BTC, the asset, from Bitcoin, the rails. BTC will remain the most inflation-resistant Lindy asset. The rails where you now access BTC on chain will matter.  Transacting on the L1 may be considered a high-value, ""luxury"" settlement only where L2s offer a cheaper, faster, and better means of moving onchain.  Take Stacks, a programmable layer for Bitcoin which began in 2018. The just-activated Nakamoto upgrade for Stacks represents a significant leap forward regarding Bitcoin liquidity and integration into both traditional and decentralized financial systems. With the sBTC protocol live as of two days ago, we're looking at an ecosystem where Bitcoin can be used more flexibly without sacrificing decentralization. Stacks' sBTC brings Bitcoin liquidity without requiring centralized exchanges, solving a long-standing problem in Bitcoin's integration into DeFi.  Through projects like Granite, Stacks is providing tools for decentralized lending and borrowing without rehypothecation, keeping Bitcoin liquidity non-custodial and transparent. Stacks' native sBTC brings another layer of innovation, enabling users to move Bitcoin seamlessly across various applications without losing its decentralized qualities.  People now realize their BTC has significant value and are looking for avenues to safely invest their BTC for yield, get liquidity against it, or acquire more BTC.  It's less about spending BTC freely but more about managing risk not to lose your BTC and never to sell. That's why protocols like Granite exist, offering a transparent on-chain way to borrow against without selling.  When you bridge/wrap BTC to another on-chain asset, you want it to feel like Bitcoin ‚Äì the same network robustness, resilience, and decentralization.  Technological innovations like BitVM, which introduces complex smart contracts to Bitcoin, and OP_Cat, which brings covenant-based programming, are opening new doors. These advancements enable more advanced governance models to be built on Bitcoin without compromising security. This pivot toward programmability marks a new chapter for Bitcoin.  And by mid-2024, projects like Coinbase's cbBTC have tokenized Bitcoin for applications, with cbBTC acting as collateral in lending protocols, mirroring the success of Ethereum's wrapped assets ‚Äî¬†yet another indicator that Bitcoin is broadening its utility beyond simple buy-and-hold strategies.  At 16, Bitcoin is maturing into more than just a monetary asset ‚Äî it‚Äôs becoming the infrastructure for a decentralized world. With hundreds of Layer 2s launching, Bitcoin is becoming something far expansive than perhaps Satoshi ever intended. We‚Äôre now building a financial future where Bitcoin is now the rails for decentralized finance, digital identities and smart contracts. Bitcoin's programmability through technologies like Stacks and BitVM offers capabilities once thought to be better suited to other blockchains.  While institutional interest is a significant milestone, it raises concerns about how Bitcoin‚Äôs core values ‚Äî decentralization, security, and permissionlessness ‚Äî can be preserved. EFTs are great for massive awareness and adoption but leave less freely circulating BTC on-chain. With billions of capital flowing into Bitcoin ETFs, institutions will play a major role in Bitcoin's future. Therefore, Bitcoin builders must ensure that this doesn‚Äôt come at the expense of Bitcoin‚Äôs core principles. To put this in perspective, institutions like BlackRock are wielding financial influence that have the potential to influence Bitcoin‚Äôs ecosystem. For instance, its AUM dwarfs the entire market capitalization of many cryptocurrencies.  Bitcoin at 16 is not about having all the answers; it‚Äôs about having the tools, the developers, and the vision to keep building. All paths are leading to users wanting consumer crypto ‚Äî a place where Ordinals, Runes, and DeFi can thrive. But we‚Äôve hardly just begun. The road ahead is vast, but with the right builders steering, the journey has only begun.

He discussed this in a recent analysis on X following Bitcoin‚Äôs latest upward push, which saw it retest the $73K peak on Oct. 29. Zeberg‚Äôs analysis focuses on Fibonacci levels, and key market indicators to make the case for a substantial rally.¬†Bitcoin Fibonacci Levels and Target ZonesThe macroeconomist‚Äôs chart displays several important price levels. The report confirmed that Bitcoin currently trades within a prolonged consolidation phase, which has persisted since Bitcoin dropped from the all-time high above $73K in March.This consolidation phase features a downward sloping channel, suggesting that the bears had gained control of the market since then. However, Zeberg‚Äôs chart suggests a break above BTC‚Äôs all-time high could trigger the breakout from this channel. Bitcoin 1M Chart | Henrik Zeberg The chart identifies the Fibonacci 0.382 level at $71,471, which is important for Bitcoin‚Äôs price action, marking a re-entry into a key area near its historical all-time highs. Below this level, another crucial support zone is identified around $53,000, serving as a potential floor in case of a market correction.¬†Timeline for Bitcoin to Claim Cycle TopIf Bitcoin holds above this level, it may signal ongoing bullish momentum, but a breach could indicate a shift in market sentiment. However, if Bitcoin holds this support and instead breaks above the upper line, it could soar to greater heights.His report highlights the Fibonacci 1.618 level close to $115,000 as a probable top for this Bitcoin cycle following a breach. Reaching this target would represent a new all-time high for the premier crypto asset.¬†This would reinforce the idea that Bitcoin‚Äôs bull market might still have room to run. Zeberg believes this upward push could happen within a three-month period. According to his projection, this rally would bring Bitcoin to a range of $115,000 to $123,000 as its cycle top.This prediction syncs with projections from market veteran Peter Brandt, who recently confirmed that Bitcoin remains within a bearish consolidation phase until it breaches its inverted broadening triangle.¬†Brandt predicts a $135,000 target for Bitcoin‚Äôs cycle top. At press time, Bitcoin trades for $71,493, holding above the psychological support at $71,000 despite the recent downturn. Following a near 3% drop yesterday, Bitcoin has gained 1.81% today, as it aims to recover the previous losses.Longer-Term Outlook and Economic WarningsWhile Zeberg‚Äôs short-term target of $115,000 to $123,000 for Bitcoin is bullish, he recently advised investors to be cautious based on his economic outlook shared today.¬†https://twitter.com/HenrikZeberg/status/1852263363092336723In the recent commentary, he warned of an impending economic downturn. Zeberg suggests that the U.S. market may reach a peak in 2024, after which the global economy could face substantial challenges.¬†He forecasts a severe recession beginning in 2025, potentially followed by a prolonged bear market, which he believes could be the most challenging economic period since the early 20th century.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/01/swissblocks-head-macroeconomist-sets-timeline-for-bitcoin-to-target-115k-to-123k/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=swissblocks-head-macroeconomist-sets-timeline-for-bitcoin-to-target-115k-to-123k,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

42415695,WEE6jQWt4rgJorpzkntxwW,1730471565,Jeff Bezos Just Made The Media's Trust Problem Worse,"Everyone knows traditional media is broken. Nobody knows how to fix it ‚Äî not even Jeff Bezos.  This week, more than 250,000 subscribers ‚Äî or about 10% of Washington Post's subscriber digital subscriber base ‚Äî canceled their subscriptions after owner Jeff Bezos quashed a Kamala Harris endorsement for President to break with decades of precedent at one of the oldest publications in the country.  After more resignations in protest from The Post's editorial board, Bezos penned a reactionary op-ed that sought to explain his reasoning, only to dig the hole even deeper by further exposing the whole reason for the disaster in the first place: Nobody trusts the media.  As a former mainstream journalist turned founder of Trustless Media, the company that helped incubate and launch Coinage and Best Dish Ever as community-owned media outlets, Bezos' op-ed was a fascinating thing to read: both because it was so right, and yet, excruciatingly wrong. I'll explain why (and why we should all further see why Web3 could be the answer to the mainstream media's problems). But first, let's acknowledge where Jeff Bezos is right.  According to Gallup data, trust in U.S. mainstream media has been at all-time lows for the last two years. There are a lot of reasons as to why that might be. Perhaps the most parroted is one that Elon Musk has made repeatedly ‚Äì that traditional media‚Äôs advertising model means it optimizes solely for advertisers, which means clicks, which means outlets increasingly catering to polarized crowds and inevitable allegations of bias. To Bezos, endorsements only worsen that.  ""What presidential endorsements actually do is create a perception of bias. A perception of non-independence,"" Bezos says.  As a journalist who has observed and lived under proper editorial regimes where sales teams are separate from editorial, I can tell you that allegations of catering to advertisers are almost always off-base. But, as Jeff Bezos himself writes, saying as much matters little if the readers or the audience still believes an outlet is biased. That is, there really isn‚Äôt a good way to refute allegations of bias. Unfortunately for Jeff Bezos, he‚Äôs learning that now.  In his op-ed, he claims there was no selfish, ulterior motive for him to block the Post‚Äôs endorsement for Kamala Harris. ""I wish we had made the change earlier than we did... That was inadequate planning, and not some intentional strategy,‚Äù he said.  But when you‚Äôre operating at the lowest levels of trust ‚Äì ever ‚Äì you can‚Äôt assume anyone is going to trust you either. Which brings us back to the first question: How can the media fix its trust problem?  This is exactly what we‚Äôre building Web3 for. It‚Äôs for a world where a billionaire media owner can‚Äôt just swoop in and unilaterally block an endorsement. The only path forward is to give into the notion of complete transparency.  As proof of this in a parallel example, Coinage faced the same dilemma: Is a Presidential endorsement warranted for a new publication? Rather than a billionaire owner making that call, our community of NFT holders voted on an onchain proposal. Even though we arrived at the same conclusion ‚Äì that making no endorsement was better than making one in either direction ‚Äì the transparency of it all creates a far better defense against any allegations of bias or ulterior motives.  Web3 as a technology empowers this for the first time in the internet‚Äôs history. It gives individuals co-ownership over not just decisions outlets might need to make, and ownership over those decisions as well.  If Jeff Bezos is right ‚Äì that the perception of bias is the cause behind record levels of distrust in American media ‚Äì stopping endorsements in and of itself isn‚Äôt going to be enough of a fix (and in this case, can actually make that problem worse.) It‚Äôs time Web3 tech, transparency, and co-ownership be built into the heart of a media organization. Until then, allegations of bias will continue to win.

35469394,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651024,1730469604,"Bitcoin Price Slides Below $70,000: These Are The Key Reasons","The Bitcoin (BTC) price has experienced a significant downturn over the past 24 hours, falling below the critical $70,000 threshold. After reaching a peak of $73,620 on Tuesday, the cryptocurrency has declined by approximately 5.7%, hitting a low of $68,830 on Friday. Analysts point to several key factors behind this decline: #1 Risk-Off Sentiment Ahead of US Election The timing of Bitcoin‚Äôs price drop coincides with a narrowing lead for former President Donald Trump over Democratic candidate Vice President Kamala Harris in prediction markets such as Polymarket and Kalshi, where users bet on election outcomes. Bitcoin has been considered a ‚ÄúTrump hedge‚Äù due to the former president‚Äôs strong advocacy for the cryptocurrency sector. Donald Trump has proposed establishing a ‚Äústrategic Bitcoin reserve‚Äù in the United States if re-elected. Speaking at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference, he outlined plans to retain all Bitcoin currently held or acquired by the US government as part of this reserve. This initiative is a core element of his campaign to strengthen the US as a leader, aiming to make the country the ‚Äúcrypto capital of the planet.‚Äù Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Hit $200,000 Only If The Dollar Falls? Bitwise CIO Answers Earlier in the week, when Trump‚Äôs lead over Harris was more substantial, Bitcoin neared its all-time high of $73,777. The shrinking of Trump‚Äôs lead appears to have prompted investors to adopt a risk-off stance, contributing to the price decline. Crypto analyst HornHairs noted that derisking before elections has precedent. ‚ÄúDerisking into the election 5-6 days before it takes place happened in both 2020 and 2016. Price then went on to never retest the lows set the week before the election ever again. Be careful what you sell here,‚Äù he remarked via X. #2 S&P 500 Loses 3-Month Trendline The correlation between Bitcoin and traditional financial markets may have also influenced BTC‚Äôs price movement. The S&P 500 has fallen to its lowest level since October 9, potentially affecting investor sentiment in the crypto space. Analysts from The Kobeissi Letter observed that despite major tech companies like Apple reporting strong earnings, their stock prices have declined. ‚ÄúYet another tech giant to beat earnings but trade lower,‚Äù they noted, adding that technology stocks faced widespread selling even as Meta, Amazon, and Apple exceeded earnings expectations. They added, It appears that markets are de-risking ahead of the election next week. Brace for volatility.‚Äù Related Reading: BlackRock‚Äôs Bitcoin ETF Reaches 2% Of Total BTC Supply Amid Record Inflows Crypto trader Marco Johanning highlighted concerns about the S&P 500 losing its three-month trendline. ‚ÄúGiven that the S&P 500 lost the 3-months trendline yesterday, it looks more like a potential selloff before the US election on Tuesday and lower prices in the short term. The perfect bounce level is the 7-month trendline (blue). I don‚Äôt want to see prices below the POC/key level around 63k (red),‚Äù he wrote via X. #3 Leverage Flush Out A significant unwinding of leveraged positions in the markets has also contributed to Bitcoin‚Äôs price decline. The market correction appears to be a healthy response to an overextension driven by leverage. Renowned crypto analyst Miles Deutscher noted: ‚ÄúThis pullback is normal (and expected). Market was looking overextended the last few days, and largely driven by leverage. Still not buying heavy as it isn‚Äôt a full cascade yet‚Äîwill wait for one of those days around the election. Not a bad DCA day for certain coins tho.‚Äù Austin Reid, Global Head of Revenue & Business at crypto prime brokerage firm FalconX, pointed out that the crypto derivatives market was ‚Äúon fire‚Äù ahead of the election, with futures open interest for BTC, ETH, and SOL crossing the $50 billion mark for the first time. On-chain analyst Axel Adler Jr reported that open interest was reduced by $2.1 billion, implying a significant leverage flush out. According to data from Coinglass, over the past 24 hours, 93,864 traders were liquidated, with total liquidations amounting to $286.73 million. The largest single liquidation order occurred on Binance‚Äôs BTCUSDT pair, valued at $11.26 million. For Bitcoin alone, $81.38 million in long positions were liquidated‚Äîthe largest amount since October 1. At press time, BTC traded at $69,446.

35470139,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=100139,1730467813,Macro Economist Ponders Whether XRP ‚ÄúPsycho Pump‚Äù Could Mark Cycle Top,"Macroeconomist Seth explores the possibility that a potential XRP ‚Äúpsycho pump‚Äù could signal the peak of the current crypto market cycle, drawing parallels to historical trends. The crypto market experienced an exceptional price run this week, particularly with Bitcoin. However, altcoins like XRP largely lagged in the buoyant market, failing to show outstanding performance alongside Bitcoin. As XRP price action this week attracted attention from holders, market watchers assured that XRP would eventually have its own bull run. Meanwhile, Seth, a macroeconomist, recently highlighted an unusual characteristic of XRP‚Äôs market behavior.XRP Parabolic Move ‚ÄúSigns‚Äù of Market TopIn a tweet, Seth shared the content of a conversation with a Bitcoin whale who suggested that XRP‚Äôs performance could be a vital indicator of the crypto market‚Äôs trajectory. According to Seth‚Äôs source, a parabolic rally in XRP traditionally signals the peak of a bull market.This post sparked speculation within the crypto community about whether XRP could experience a dramatic ""psycho pump"" in the final stages of the current market cycle.For context, the ongoing crypto bull run is already a year old, and analysts expect it to last for another year before a bear market surfaces.¬†Seth's perspective suggests that while XRP has remained relatively stagnant during this bull market, it may continue to underperform for a while longer before it begins its much-anticipated uptrend. However, by that time, the bull market could be nearing its end.Seth's message resonated with some, who noted that XRP has historically shown strong price spikes toward the end of bullish periods. However, others dismissed this perspective, arguing that similar claims could be made for other altcoins.Notably, the case for XRP largely draws inspiration from the 2016/2017 Bitcoin post-halving bull season, during which XRP saw a dramatic push. XRP‚Äôs Dramatic Push That Marked a Cycle TopAfter Bitcoin halved on July 9, 2016, BTC‚Äôs price was around $600. By January 2017, it had surpassed $1,000. The rally strengthened throughout 2017, reaching a cycle peak of approximately $20,000 by December.In contrast, XRP‚Äôs trajectory during this time was relatively flat, trading with two leading zeros until April 2017. XRP did cancel another zero the following month but struggled within that range for several months until December 2017.¬†In a remarkable surge, XRP rose from $0.2522 on December 12, 2017, to an all-time high of $3.84 by January 4, 2018. Following this peak, the crypto market entered a bear market from which XRP has yet to fully recover.The Case for 2020/2021In the 2020/2021 cycle , XRP‚Äôs uptrend did not mark the end of the overall bull market. Specifically, XRP‚Äôs price peaked at $1.96 in April 2021, around the same time Bitcoin first hit $60K.¬†While Bitcoin later dropped to $30K, it eventually resumed its upward trend, reaching a cycle peak of $68K in November 2021. However, XRP did not benefit from this resurgence, as its peak occurred back in April. Some suggest this was due to the SEC lawsuit, which began in December 2020.",NEUTRAL,BTC | XRP,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/01/macro-economist-ponders-whether-xrp-psycho-pump-could-mark-cycle-top/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=macro-economist-ponders-whether-xrp-psycho-pump-could-mark-cycle-top,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

35467070,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=100108,1730466648,Analyst Says Shiba Inu Will Explode When This Happens,"Market analyst Crypto Jack has asserted that Shiba Inu will see an upward explosion if the token breaks free from a crucial price structure. Shiba Inu put in a strong performance earlier in the week, surging to $0.00001947 on Tuesday. Its bullish uptick ensured it surpassed Avalanche to become the 12th largest cryptocurrency by market cap.However, a global market downturn on Wednesday triggered a correction for the crypto market, with Shiba Inu also facing the heat. For context, the dog-themed meme coin is down 6.40% in the past 24 hours, relinquishing all its weekly gains to the latest retracement.Meanwhile, market analyst Crypto Jack has identified an important price structure standing in the path of Shiba Inu‚Äôs explosive uptrend, arguing that the top-ranking meme coin will surge extensively if it breaks from the pattern.Analyst Shows Shiba Inu‚Äôs Major Price ImpedimentIn a Thursday X post , Crypto Jack noted that Shiba Inu is in a price range. The accompanying SHIB/USD 1D chart shows that the meme coin started forming the price pattern after hitting the three-month high on September 27. Shiba Inu price prediction Notably, the $0.000020 to $0.000021 zone formed the range top, while the $0.000015 zone became the lower region. SHIB has continued to trade within the range for over one month now.Crypto Jack asserted that Shiba Inu must break past the range's upper boundary to ‚Äúexplode to the upside.‚Äù Meanwhile, the analyst‚Äôs chart shows he expects a revisit of the lower zone before breaking past the resistance at $0.000021.Explosive Upside After Defying ResistanceMeanwhile, the market watcher had earlier identified the $0.000021 resistance as a must-breach for sustained Shiba Inu upsides. In an earlier report , he noted that if SHIB breaks above the supply zone, the next stop would be around $0.000027.Furthermore, analyst Crypto Sheriff expects Shiba Inu‚Äôs next stop to be around $0.0002 after breaching the resistance. The renowned market speculator also targeted an ambitious surge to $0.001, representing an over 5,400% increase from the current market price.Notably, Shiba Inu currently trades at $0.00001745 as at press time, down almost 2% in the past seven days and 20.3% away from Crypto Jack‚Äôs upper range price.",POSITIVE,SHIB,MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/01/analyst-says-shiba-inu-will-explode-when-this-happens/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=analyst-says-shiba-inu-will-explode-when-this-happens,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

The U.S. added just 12,000 jobs in October, according to the Nonfarm Payrolls report, well shy of economist forecasts for 113,000. September's job gain of 254,000 was revised down to 223,000. October's unemployment rate was 4.1% versus 4.1% expected and 4.1% in September.  In addition to September's downward revision, August's originally reported 159,000 job gain was revised lower to 78,000.

The recent surge in open interest has been a key factor in driving BTC‚Äôs price action, with open interest reaching $23.9 billion on October 30, a significant uptick that indicated high market engagement. However, in the past 24 hours, data from CryptoQuant reveals a $2.1 billion decline in open interest, signaling a shift as BTC‚Äôs price retraces to lower levels. Related Reading: Dogwifhat (WIF) Prepares For A Bullish Breakout ‚Äì Analyst Sets $3 Target This cooling off has led analysts to closely watch for renewed buying interest from spot investors, which could provide the fuel needed for BTC to rally once more. With Bitcoin hovering near key support levels, a push from spot investors could potentially set the stage for a strong rebound. The next few days will be pivotal as traders and analysts alike await fresh inflows that may reinforce BTC‚Äôs resilience and prepare it for another test of its all-time highs. As BTC holds around $69,000, market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, with eyes on spot activity to gauge whether this retracement phase could soon give way to renewed momentum. Bitcoin Hype Slowing Down? Bitcoin has recently captured market excitement, coming within 1% of its March all-time high and fueling speculation of a massive breakout. However, this momentum appears to be losing steam, as BTC has yet to establish a new high, and open interest‚Äîa measure of the total value of futures contracts‚Äîhas begun to shrink. Renowned analyst Axel Adler recently shared key data on X, revealing a $2.1 billion reduction in open interest within the last 24 hours. This decline, from a peak of $23.9 billion to $21.8 billion, indicates that speculative futures trading alone may not be sufficient to push Bitcoin to new heights. Adler suggests that for Bitcoin to break past this barrier, spot investors‚Äîthe market participants who buy BTC directly rather than through derivatives‚Äîmust step in to drive demand. With futures markets retreating, fresh buying from spot investors could be the needed catalyst to take Bitcoin above its all-time high and set the stage for further gains. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Key Support To Set A $6,000 Target ‚Äì Analyst The timing is crucial, as Bitcoin is currently trading close to its historical peak, and the upcoming U.S. election on November 5 adds another layer of potential market volatility. Many market participants are eyeing the election as a potential driver of a broader market rally, with a Bitcoin bull run possibly following a political catalyst. For now, Bitcoin hovers just below its all-time high, and while the futures market pulls back, attention shifts to spot buying as a key factor in determining whether BTC can resume its upward trajectory. As BTC holds near record levels, the next few days will be pivotal in defining its short-term direction and potential for a new bull phase. BTC Holding Above Key Levels Bitcoin is currently trading above the critical $69,000 mark, which previously acted as strong resistance since late July. Holding this level as support is essential for bulls aiming to push BTC toward new all-time highs. If Bitcoin manages to consolidate above $69,000, the stage could be set for a breakthrough into uncharted territory and a price discovery phase. However, should BTC retrace below this level, it would signal that the asset needs additional momentum to test and surpass its all-time high. In the event of a pullback, $66,500 stands out as the next critical support. This level would maintain Bitcoin‚Äôs bullish structure while providing a solid base for a potential rebound. Such a dip could attract fresh buying interest and add necessary fuel to Bitcoin‚Äôs rally, preparing the market for a renewed attempt at price discovery. Related Reading: Dogecoin Metrics Reveal Increasing Network Activity ‚Äì Is DOGE Ready To Break Yearly Highs? As BTC hovers above this significant support level, traders are closely watching for signs of sustained strength or a healthy retracement to solidify the base before the next leg up.

42415696,WEE6jQWt4rgJorpzkntxzC,1730463248,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Pares Losses Following Thursday's Slump,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk‚Äôs daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 2,062.17 -3.66%  Bitcoin (BTC): $70,079.42 -3.1%  Ether (ETH): $2,519.63 -4.34%  S&P 500: 5,705.45 -1.86%  Gold: $2,752.82 +0.38%  Nikkei 225: 38,053.67 -2.63%  Top Stories  Bitcoin pared some of its losses, returning to $70,000 during the European morning after falling as low as $68,800. Still, BTC remained about 3% lower in the last 24 hours. Altcoins suffered greater losses, with the CoinDesk 20 Index's measurement of the broader crypto market down over 3.5%. Explanations for the slide range from profit-taking following the rally earlier in the week to a dip in Donald Trump's election victory odds on Polymarket. Traders have also been looking at tech earnings, tensions between Iran and Israel and a sharp rise in U.K. gilt yields following the roll-out of the government budget earlier this week, Quinn Thompson, founder of crypto hedge fund Lekker Capital, told CoinDesk.  Short-term holders of bitcoin sent more than $2.3 billion, some 32,000 BTC, to exchanges at a loss on Thursday as the price dropped below $70,000 after approaching an all-time high earlier this week. The panic selling was the most since Aug. 5's yen carry trade unwind. Short-term holders ‚Äî investors who have held bitcoin for less than 155 days ‚Äî tend to panic and sell when the price drops, and buy when there is euphoria or greed in the market. In total, they sent over 54,000 BTC to exchanges on Thursday, the highest amount since Mar. 27.  The odds on Kamala Harris winning next week's U.S. presidential election are rising on betting platform Polymarket, with some observers suggesting the increase reflects hedging positions among traders who've also bet on a victory for Donald Trump. Harris‚Äô odds have risen to almost 39% from 33% on Oct. 30. Trump's odds dropped in tandem, suggestive of lower expectations of him winning, though at 61%, he's still the preferred candidate. The increase in the price for Harris‚Äô shares could reflect traders buying them as a hedge on their Trump bets, market observers say, as some allege reports of voting irregularities pitted against Trump that could influence market bets.  Chart of the Day  Ethereum futures funding rates are showing a slight upward trend, which may reflect renewed bullish sentiment.  The funding rates metric measures the aggression of buyers versus sellers in the futures market.  Despite the recent uptick, the levels remain way below those seen in March.  ""Higher funding rates would not only confirm participants‚Äô willingness to go long on Ethereum but would also add upward pressure on the price, potentially leading to a stronger and more sustained rally,"" CryptoQuant wrote.

We've had a year without any big crypto industry meltdowns and a strong start to the year with spot bitcoin ETF launches. This year has been one of the busiest in terms of crypto ETF launches. Issuers and investors are perhaps envisioning a more crypto-friendly environment post-election, which has reignited innovation. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has had its highs and lows when it comes to investor interest (and its prices). But lately, interest has remained relatively high, and bitcoin prices have now reached over $70,000. We‚Äôve had a year without any big crypto industry meltdowns and a strong start to the year with spot bitcoin ETF launches. Now the U.S. election has been making issuers and investors more excited for the future of crypto. This year has been one of the busiest years in terms of crypto ETF launches. I‚Äôve offered glimpses of the future before. But this note provides a more focused look back at the crypto ETF industry and how that builds toward the future. Phase One: Early Beginnings, Trusts, Blockchain ETFs In the early days, we saw the beginning of crypto ETFs. The Winklevoss twins are a name many of us may have forgotten. But they were some of the original big thinkers behind crypto ETFs. Back in July 2013, the Winklevoss twins filed for the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust. That would have been the first bitcoin ETF. After three years of back and forth with the SEC, the filing was rejected citing fraud and lack of regulation (this should sound familiar because it is the same rationale given over the next 10 years). The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) (now an ETF) was launched as a trust structure in September 2013 and was initially accessible only to accredited investors. Grayscale first submitted its application for conversion to an ETF in 2016-2017 and received pushback from the SEC. It withdrew its application but continued to push for change in the regulatory environment. Around this time, they also launched the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ) (also now an ETF) as a trust. The first blockchain ETFs launched in 2018: the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF ( BLOK ) and the Siren Nasdaq NexGen Economy ETF ( BLCN ). Blockchain ETFs hold equity securities in the blockchain and crypto space, which was a very nascent industry at the time. Coinbase Global ( COIN ), which is one of the most well-known crypto stocks, did not go public until April 2021. Phase Two: Bitcoin Goes Mainstream During the pandemic, crypto took off. Partly fueled by stimulus payments and partly fueled by the boredom of staying at home - suddenly everyone became a crypto investor. If you were lucky enough to follow the meme stock craze in early 2020, you might have bought bitcoin for $5,000-10,000. After only about a year, the price of bitcoin would reach over $60,000. By this time, BLOK had reached over $1 billion in assets. But this also led to a disconnect. Investors were interested in bitcoin. But ETFs weren‚Äôt really part of that picture, since we only had blockchain equity ETFs. They were correlated with bitcoin prices. But the comparison is like investing in an energy ETF versus investing in an oil ETF. Issuers were still eager to file for the first spot bitcoin ETF. Issuers like VanEck, ARK, and Bitwise continued to file for a spot bitcoin ETF filing despite persistent denials. It wasn‚Äôt until May 2021 that the first ETF with crypto in its name launched - the Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF ( BITQ ). As mentioned before, blockchain ETFs typically used terms like blockchain, digital transformation, next-generation economy. We were getting closer to a true bitcoin ETF, but still only in the adjacent space. Phase Three: Finally... the First U.S. Bitcoin ETF The excitement continued to build until the first U.S. bitcoin ETF was launched in October 2021 - the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ). At the time, this was the second-biggest launch in history in terms of trading activity. While this was considered the first U.S. bitcoin ETF (and a big milestone), it was futures-based. Investors were looking ahead to potential spot bitcoin ETF launches, which would be physically backed by bitcoin and not subject to roll costs like a futures-based product. That same month, Grayscale filed another application for GBTC‚Äôs conversion, which was later rejected in June 2022. That summer, there was a shift in sentiment toward bitcoin and crypto. We saw the collapse of terraUSD and luna, along with the bankruptcy of Celsius. Bitcoin prices were heading below $20,000. It was the perfect time for an inverse bitcoin ETF to come out. The ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITI ) was launched in June 2022 at a time where many expected bitcoin prices to keep falling. Phase Four: Short Bitcoin and Closures After the inverse product was released, bitcoin prices continued to see pressure. This was further fueled by the FTX collapse and many investors wanted nothing to do with crypto anymore. During this time, several funds closed, including funds that focused on the crypto mining equity sector. But a bullish sentiment wasn‚Äôt dead - the 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITX ) was launched a year after BITI, in June 2023. At this point, it was unclear why a spot bitcoin ETF wasn‚Äôt approved. But we had inverse and 2x leveraged products. Futures are regulated by the CFTC. But common sense suggested that a spot bitcoin ETF should have been approved by this point. Phase Five: Spot ETFs and Everything Else You Can Think Of A lot of things happened very quickly over the past year and a half. In August 2023, the courts finally agreed that it did not make sense for futures bitcoin products to exist and not spot bitcoin products. Grayscale won its legal battle against the SEC. That meant it was now a matter of when, not if, spot bitcoin ETFs would be approved. But before spot bitcoin ETFs were launched, ether futures ETFs were surprisingly fast-tracked in October 2023. That added more fuel to the fire that not only spot bitcoin ETFs would be approved but so would spot ether ETFs. Issuers raced to file, including large asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity, with the iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ) and the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ). With several almost identical products filed, a fee war resulted. Most of the spot bitcoin ETFs had fee waivers for the first six months or up to a certain amount of assets. Even after fee waivers, fees were generally low (20-25 bps). Spot bitcoin ETFs finally launched in January. They ended up being the most successful launch on record (and they continue to draw attention almost 10 months later). The spot ether ETF launch followed somewhat quickly in July and was relatively less successful. But since then, issuers have been getting creative with other launches. Most of these are ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù strategies like leveraged or derivative funds, despite some roadblocks to adoption for anything beyond traditional spot bitcoin ETFs. Besides leveraged or derivative funds, we‚Äôve also seen funds like the STKD Bitcoin & Gold ETF ( BTGD ), which holds both bitcoin and gold. New blockchain ETFs like the SPDR Galaxy Transformative Tech Accelerators ETF ( TEKX ) are still emerging, which State Street and Galaxy launched in early September, along with a suite of two other ETFs. Additionally, the SEC granted approval to the Cboe and NYSE for trading options for certain ETFs recently. (The NYSE has also approved options on a small number of spot bitcoin ETFs.) Several more spot ETFs have also been filed, including Solana, XRP, and Litecoin. Final Thoughts: More Crypto Innovation, Launches in the Future Notably, the biggest takeaway from this is that issuers haven‚Äôt been holding back with crypto. Issuers and investors are perhaps envisioning a more crypto-friendly environment post-election, which has reignited innovation. Although it is currently ahead of the investor adoption curve, I believe innovation is essential for the crypto ETF environment and plays an important role in competition and education - which will ultimately breed greater adoption.

In the past three days, short-term holders sent more than $6 billion worth of bitcoin to exchanges at a profit, locking in gains as the month drew to a close.  Disclaimer: The analyst who wrote this piece owns bitcoin.  Short-term holders of bitcoin {{BTC}} sent about $2.3 billion, some 32,000 tokens, of the largest cryptocurrency to exchanges at a loss on Thursday as the price dropped below $70,000 after approaching an all-time high earlier in the week.  The panic selling was the most since Aug. 5's yen carry trade unwind. Short-term holders ‚Äî investors who have held bitcoin for less than 155 days ‚Äî tend to panic and sell when the price drops, and buy when there is euphoria or greed in the market. In total, they sent over 54,000 BTC to exchanges on Thursday, the highest amount since Mar. 27.  A number of factors may be playing into the recent drop, which has taken BTC to about 6% below its record.  A U.S. presidential election is coming on Nov. 5, with investors most likely reducing their exposure to risk, which they tend to do on the last day of the month.  We also witnessed an almost $1 trillion wipeout of the U.S. stock market on Thursday, with every one of the so-called magnificent seven tech stocks in the red.  Breaking down Thursday's 54,000 bitcoin into profit and loss, CoinDesk research has shown continued profit-taking as bitcoin inched closer to March's record high. On Thursday, 22,000 BTC was sent to exchanges in profit, and over the past three days, over $6 billion of bitcoin was sent to exchanges in profit. Bitcion rose 11% last month.  Considering the 155-day timespan to be considered in this category, the investors would have most likely bought this week. Bitcoin rose above $70,000 in May and July and holders then didn't seem phased by the subsequent 20% drawdowns, a sign they're not likely to be shaken out by a 6% price drop.

Analyst Who Called $72,000 Surge Reveals What Needs To Happen","Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has revealed what needs to happen next for the Bitcoin price to surpass its current all-time high (ATH) of $73,700. The analyst had rightly predicted the recent price rally to $72,000 but warned back then that the flagship crypto won‚Äôt hit its ATH instantly. How The Bitcoin Price Can Reach New ATH Martinez mentioned in an X post that the Bitcoin price needs to hold above the $69,000 support level to reach a new ATH. He claimed that a successful hold above that support level could lead to a price rally to $78,000. This came as he noted that the Bitcoin price movement was going according to plan. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Completes 12 Weeks Of Bottom Formation, Analyst Says Don‚Äôt Aim Lower Than $4,900 ATH Before now, Martinez had predicted that the Bitcoin price would rise to $72,000 if it held above $65,000, which eventually happened. Back then, he added that BTC would likely experience a pullback to $69,000 after this price, which has also now happened, with the flagship crypto closing in October below $70,000. This price correction is believed to be healthy, considering the pump that BTC enjoyed earlier in the week, coming close to its current ATH. This pump was followed by a wave of profit-taking, with whales, including Bhutan, selling their BTC holdings to secure some profits. Ali Martinez indicated that the flagship crypto is still in bullish territory, as he alluded to BTC‚Äôs historical performance in November, a month in which it has recorded more positive returns than negative ones. In another X post, he suggested that the Bitcoin price could go parabolic after the US elections. He shared a chart of BTC‚Äôs movement after the last three US presidential elections and remarked that he doesn‚Äôt expect this time to be different. Bitcoin hit a new ATH after those elections, which could happen again. How It Could Play Out After The US Election Economist Alex Kr√ºger has provided insights into how the Bitcoin price could move after the US elections. In an X post, he claimed there is a 55% probability that BTC will reach $90,000 by year-end if Donald Trump wins. This is based on the fact that the former US president has declared his support for cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Puts Dogecoin Price As High As $2.4, What Does Elon Musk Have To Do With It? Meanwhile, if Kamala Harris wins, Kr√ºger mentioned that there is a 45% probability that the Bitcoin price will be trading at $65,000 by year-end. The economist put the weighted average for BTC‚Äôs price at $79,000. He also told market participants to expect a swift Bitcoin price rally if Trump wins. At the same time, he said he expects BTC to range between $65,000 and $68,000 going into the election night. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $69,400, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The current imbalance between supply and demand is favorable for a sustained uptrend. This was one of the thematic catalysts that, we believed, would propel Bitcoin over $100,000. While we still believe the original price targets of $106,000-190,000 are attainable, we do believe risk has increased. In December 2022, when Bitcoin was trading around $17,000, we boldly stated that "" Bitcoin is a buy ."" At the time, we were beginning to position for a new Bitcoin bull cycle. We even posted a chart in this report entitled "" Bitcoin's Upcoming Rally - What You Need to Know ,"" showing our targets for the coming bull market of $75,000-132,000, shown below. Tech Insider Network This was an unpopular report at the time, as Bitcoin was down nearly 80% from the 2021 highs, and was coming off the heels of a crypto panic following the FTX scandal. Over 1 year later, in March 2024, Bitcoin did indeed hit $73,757 -- just shy of our lower target. With tech stocks, we offer fundamental analysis to identify what to buy, and then we use technical analysis as a supplement for gauging sentiment and risk. However, with Bitcoin, there is no management team, earnings calls, and minimal news events. For this reason, we lean heavily into technical analysis and on-chain analysis to guide our position management. These techniques are what we used to call the 2022 low, as well as the accurate upper targets a year in advance. These same techniques were used when we increased our upper targets to $106,000-190,000 in our April 2024 report . We believe these targets are attainable, which is supported by the updated technical analysis as well as the on-chain analysis below. However, the correction that started in March of this year was simply too long in time, and has led to us adjusting our targets. We are also adjusting our game plan for the sake of risk management and will look to reduce our crypto exposure by ~50% on the next push to all-time highs (ATHs), locking in well-deserved gains. We will then revisit buying back once we get more information on the following consolidation. Technical Analysis Since 2019, we have repeatedly presented to our Premium Members that we are in a large degree uptrend that started in late 2018. This uptrend is taking the shape of a standard 5-wave pattern, which is one of the reasons we were calling for a low in 2022. In our December 2022 report, we stated: As of now, since the 2018 low, we only have 4 waves in place, which implies that we have one more 5th wave push before the larger bull cycle is over."" As bad as it felt, this made the recent bear market a correction within a larger uptrend. We simply did not have a full 5 waves in place, and until we saw a 5th wave push to new highs, the pattern remained incomplete. We are currently in that final 5th wave of this nearly 7-year uptrend. That being said, we still see the potential for another +50% - 90% move higher in the coming months. Tech Insider Network The below is our price analysis on this final 5th wave that started in November 2022. It is also unfolding as a standard 5-wave pattern, and is incomplete until we push to new all-time highs. We stated this in our April 2024 report , which we used to buy this dip. We are in a large 5 wave pattern, which is targeting well above $100,000. It is an incomplete pattern, and needs 2 more large swings higher to complete the full 5 waves. Like with all 5 wave patterns, we have bought on each dip, and continue to buy as long as we stay above critical support."" As stated earlier, the correction this year was simply too long in time to not adjust our prior price targets. While we still believe Bitcoin can go well into the $100,000 region, we will take a more active stance going forward to protect our gains. Updated Bitcoin Targets Our updated target for this next push higher is between $82,000 and $106,000 . There are now two scenarios that we are tracking, which will determine our risk management: Red - We push into the $82,000-106,000 region, completing the minimum number of waves required within this bull cycle. This will end the large degree bull market that started in 2018. Green - After pushing into the $82,000-106,000 region, instead of topping in the 5th wave, we are topping in the 3rd wave. We then see another multi-week to multi-month correction that holds over $41,156-47,750, which eventually leads to the final 5th wave taking us well into the $132,000-190,000 region. Tech Insider Network We do believe the next breakout will likely be limited, and that another correction will soon follow. To support this, note when price went vertical in February, which was met with max volume and max momentum. This is what 3rd waves look like. It is the part of the trend where everyone realizes, at once, the direction of the market. This leads to shorts covering, and longs buying more, putting everyone on the same side of the market. The common characteristic of a 5th wave, which is the final swing in a trend, is that price makes one more high, but on less volume and lower momentum. From a sentiment perspective, the start of a 4th wave consolidation is when smart money exits. The 5th wave tends to happen when investors that are late, want to get exposure to what is believed to be a continuation of the trend. This explains why price goes higher with reduced buyers and weaker momentum. Note these patterns in play in the chart above. We are clearly in a 5th wave, which will give way to more volatility when it completes. Confirmation of 5th Wave Targets To further support our new targets, the pattern of this new swing is also pointing to the same region. If we zoom in on the current bounce we are in, it is taking the shape of an ending diagonal pattern. This pattern only shows up at the end of a move, which fits with us being in some type of a 5th wave. An ending diagonal consists of 5 waves with large overlaps. The 3rd wave is targeting $74,000-82,000, and the final 5th wave is targeting the $82,000-106,000 region. As long as any volatility stays above $58,800-60,800, I expect us to push into these targets. Tech Insider Network As of now, we have provided 13 buy alerts to our premium members at the $17,000, $26,000, $33,000, $40,000, $55,000 and $62,000 regions. These unrealized gains range from +300% to 15%, based on our buy alerts. Our game plan is to reduce risk, take well-deserved gains on this next push higher. Once we approach these upper targets, we will enter distribution mode. We will then analyze the next pullback to determine if the more bullish scenario in green is likely to play out. If so, we will add back at levels that are lower risk. On-Chain Analysis For those that are not familiar with on-chain data, it offers a unique type of fundamental analysis within crypto and is a relatively new field of study. We partnered with WealthUmbrella, a team of machine learning engineers and professors, to provide this level of analysis within the crypto space. The below was provided to us by Vincent Duchaine, the CEO of WealthUmbrella, and interestingly, they arrive at the same general conclusions as our technical analysis. The current imbalance between supply and demand is favorable for a sustained uptrend. This was one of the thematic catalysts that, we believed, would propel Bitcoin over $100,000, and it is still playing out today. If you look at the ETF flows over the last several weeks, we are seeing buyers move back into the ETFs, creating positive flows. WealthUmbrella This is further backed up by the amount of newly created addresses on the blockchain with a non-zero starting balance. This metric has also been consistently on the rise over the last 2 months. It is suggesting that new investors are becoming interested in Bitcoin, which increases also demand. WealthUmbrella The above data supports a renewed interest in Bitcoin, as demand from new investors is back on the rise. What we like to see along with this pattern is the behavior of the long-term Bitcoin investors (hodlers). We can measure behavior by analyzing the percentage of Bitcoins that have not moved in over a year, which we call our 1-Year HODL percentage indicator. WealthUmbrella As demand increases at a greater rate than the supply of Bitcoin, we expect price to continue to rise. The above trends should also continue as price increases, which is typically what we see at the onset of a fresh Bitcoin rally. Regarding where we see this rally going, we first need to see a price candle close above the current all-time highs. The history of Bitcoin tells us that once we accomplish this, we typically see Bitcoin in price discovery mode for at least a few weeks before going into a consolidation or a pullback. The March high was an exception. Even though we closed above all-time highs in March, this was accompanied by very rare overbought signals that tend to precede a correction. Today, all our metrics have been reset due to the length of the recent correction, which further supports a rally. For example, one of our primary metrics for gauging cyclical tops/bottoms in Bitcoin, our Metcalfe's Law discount/premium model, was at 3.3 standard deviations around the ATH in March 2024. This is a reading only seen at prior cyclical tops, and warranted caution. Today, this same model is at only 0.2 today, which is consistent with meaningful lows within ongoing uptrends. WealthUmbrella For reference, the last time this indicator was at such a value was in October 2023 when Bitcoin was at $28K. This allowed Bitcoin to reach $45K, a 60% move, before consolidating. As Bitcoin's market cap increases, investors should not expect the same % moves when it was much smaller. However, if we were to move higher in only the absolute value from the last time we saw this metric at a similar support, we would see a ~$16,000 increase in price, which would bring Bitcoin to around $80,000. This doesn't mean that Bitcoin will stop at this conservative target, as the move to $45,000 last year was then followed by a move to $73,000 after some consolidation. If Bitcoin were to move by the same percentage, this would bring the price to around $115,000, a price we believe Bitcoin will someday reach, but not necessarily as soon as the current rally. This lines up with the technical analysis presented - a high probability rally that will likely fall below the $100,000 mark. If our on-chain analysis had to lean in one direction with what we are seeing now, it would support the green scenario outlined above. In other words, we should see another period of consolidation before pushing well into the $100,000 region. According to our Cyclical Top Indicator, we are still quite early this next leg higher. One of the projects we spent an enormous amount of time on was creating cyclical top and bottom indicators that will give a normalized reading across each cycle. Our bottom indicator has already proven to be quite accurate in calling the November 2022 bottom . WealthUmbrella We expect the same with our Cyclical Top Indicator, which is shown below. At this moment, even though we are pushing toward new all-time highs, all our top indicators remain depressed. So, even with a push into the $80,000-100,000 range in the coming rally, this indicator will still leave ample room for a prolonged uptrend to continue. WealthUmbrella We anticipate that we will need at least one pullback or consolidation after the current push, followed by another push, before seeing them at a level that will start to enter the zone that could be consistent with a major top. One final point worth mentioning is the considerable rise in the absolute floor for Bitcoin's price. Bitcoin tends to not trade too far within this floor, which we can derive from Bitcoin's realized value (the average value at which every BTC last traded) and Bitcoin's Thermocap history. WealthUmbrella While the realized value and price floor from Thermocap were around $24,000 in March 2024, these values are now $33,000 for the realized value and $28,300 for our price floor from Thermocap. These are very strong levels that tend to act as a floor at the height of a cyclical decline. Although we don't think we are going there, seeing them considerably increase while Bitcoin's price did nothing is, for us, a massive improvement that should pay off later. While this still represents considerable downside, what is important is knowing that at a cyclical top Bitcoin usually trades at 4-5X these values. The current downside appears limited and expectations for Bitcoin's price at a cyclical top become very interesting ($120K-$150K, which aligns with some targets we got in December 2023 by playing with some of our top indicators). In conclusion, while we still believe the original price targets of $106,000-190,000 are attainable, we do believe risk has increased. As a result, we will likely reduce some risk on the next rally to all-time highs. Both the technical and on-chain analysis support a move the likely falls short of $100,000, followed by another correction. We will prudently take some gains in the hope of adding back when the technical picture and on-chain data support the outlined green scenario, which would take us well into the $100,000 region. It is difficult to predict these targets, which we hold loosely as general guides for our risk management. However, there are two things we know for certain: 1) the uptrend pattern is incomplete, and will remain so until the breakout to new all-time highs; 2) several on-chain metrics have cooled off considerably over the past few months and now indicate a promising uptrend that could easily approach the $100,000.

Bitcoin‚Äôs price experienced a significant pullback, dropping from $72,500 Thursday evening to below $69,000 by early Friday. This decline reduced the gains the token had built up since the beginning of the week.The broader crypto market mirrored Bitcoin‚Äôs movements, leading to a 5.3% dip in market capitalization. As of this writing, Bitcoin's value has fallen 3.93% in the past 24 hours but has maintained a 2.95% price increase over the last seven days.However, market analyst Ali Martinez highlighted that Bitcoin's price movements were consistent with his projections. On October 26, he noted that if Bitcoin held above $65,000, it could rise to $72,000, pull back to $69,000, and eventually rally toward $78,000.With Bitcoin testing the $69,000 support level at a current price of $69,384, it remains approximately 0.55% away from this anticipated support zone. If this key level holds, it could indicate the next phase for Bitcoin. According to the analyst, if Bitcoin maintains the $69,000 support and rebounds, the price could advance toward $78,000.https://TWITTER.com/ali_charts/status/1852122881268076932¬†Indicators Point to PullbackFurther technical indicators align with the expectation of a potential retracement. Bitcoin's price is near the upper boundary of the Bollinger Bands, suggesting it recently tested the upper limit and is now experiencing a pullback. This typically indicates that the asset was overbought and may be due for a retracement to the mean (middle band). BTC 1-day Chart / TradingView Additionally, the RSI stands at 58.24, placing it in neutral territory. This level indicates that while Bitcoin is neither overbought nor oversold, it has recently come down from a higher value. This downward movement suggests that buying momentum is weakening, signaling potential for further retracement.Search Trends for Bitcoin and Retail EngagementMeanwhile, recent data shows that while Bitcoin approached its all-time high, search trends remained subdued. Insights indicate that Google searches for ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äù have been notably low despite the recent price surge.Historically, retail engagement during bull runs has coincided with spikes in search volumes. For example, Bitcoin‚Äôs rally to $20,000 in the 2017/2018 cycle correlated with an index level above 80 on Google Trends. Similarly, the rally in late 2020 to 2021 saw significant interest.In 2024, Bitcoin‚Äôs rally initially drew considerable search interest in the first quarter, aligning with its peak at $73,750 in March. However, over the subsequent seven months, search activity waned.As Bitcoin approaches record highs again, Google Trends continues to show low search interest, hinting that retail engagement may not yet have peaked.

One of its best performances was seen during the last cycle when it reached an all-time high close to the $5,000 level.Illustratively, as of January 2020, ETH traded as low as $126, but a year later, following Bitcoin's third halving cycle, Ethereum‚Äôs value had risen to above $1,400, marking an over 10X return.Meanwhile, the uptrend continued, intensifying as time went by. It initially reached $4,362 by May 2021 before the first major pullback, which dropped its price to the $1,800 range. By November 2021, Ethereum touched an all-time high of $4,859. From the $126 low in January 2020 to the peak in 2021, Ethereum registered explosive growth of 3,756%.XRP Surge Compared to EthereumHowever, during the 2020/2021 cycle, XRP, which follows closely behind Ethereum in the rankings, experienced a less impressive price surge. Specifically, XRP saw a 954% increase during a similar timeframe, rising from a low of $0.1858 in January 2020 to its cycle peak of $1.96 by 2021.In contrast, during the 2017/2018 season, XRP successfully rivaled Ethereum, demonstrating better price performance. At one point, it even outranked Ethereum, achieving the status of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap on January 7, 2018. XRP Ethereum market cap | CoinMarketCap Many believe that XRP‚Äôs weaker performance in 2020/2021 was due to the SEC‚Äôs lawsuit at the time. However, XRP has triumphed in the legal battle, and now market participants continue to speculate on XRP‚Äôs potential for this season.XRP Price if It Mirrors Ethereum‚Äôs HistoryAn intriguing perspective is whether XRP could mirror Ethereum‚Äôs 3,756% price surge from the last cycle. If XRP were to replicate Ethereum‚Äôs history, such a magnitude of price increase would propel XRP from its current value of $0.5455 to a market value of approximately $21.",NEUTRAL,ETH | XRP,ETH | MARKET | TRADING | XRP | ZRX,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/01/ethereum-surged-from-126-to-4860-in-last-cycle-what-if-xrp-surges-the-same-way/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ethereum-surged-from-126-to-4860-in-last-cycle-what-if-xrp-surges-the-same-way,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Shiba Inu (SHIB) has struggled to maintain upward momentum in recent times, remaining within a confined trading range. The asset's current price stands at $0.00001747, reflecting a 6.04% decline over the past 24 hours. Despite this lackluster performance, an analyst on the social media platform X has identified a potentially bullish pattern that could improve SHIB's trajectory.Shiba Inu Bullish Flag Formation IdentifiedClifton Fx, a crypto analyst known for his market insights, shared with his over 17,000 followers an analysis highlighting a bullish flag formation for SHIB. The chart presented by Clifton Fx displays a descending channel characterized by parallel trendlines that have served as resistance and support levels.This structure indicates a prolonged downtrend for SHIB/USDT observed since its peak in March. The asset‚Äôs current price hovers near the upper boundary of this channel, suggesting a possible test of this resistance. Shiba Inu 3-day chart by Clifton The analysis further notes that a breakout above the upper trendline could signal a strong bullish rally. The projected move, marked by a green zone on the chart, indicates that SHIB could potentially rise to $0.00003500, representing an approximate 89.76% increase from its current level.Shiba Inu Lead Developer Responds to Criticism About SHIB‚Äôs $0.01 TargetThis analysis emerges amidst ongoing discussions within the Shiba Inu community regarding its future and recognition in the crypto space. Shytoshi Kusama, the lead developer of the Shiba Inu team, recently responded to critiques about SHIB's progress toward its $0.01 target.¬†This response followed a post by Nick Tomaino, a partner at 1confirmation, who listed what he considered the most influential crypto projects, omitting Shiba Inu. Kusama's reaction pointed to a sense of underappreciation, expressing frustration over the project being overlooked despite its ranking by market cap.The conversation escalated when a user remarked that SHIB would not be taken seriously until it reached $0.01. Kusama addressed the sentiment by emphasizing SHIB‚Äôs significant achievements, highlighting that only a portion of the crypto community had fully acknowledged its impact.Large-Scale Token BurnsAdding to recent developments, Shibburn, a platform that tracks Shiba Inu burns, reported a substantial token burn of 5.58 billion SHIB tokens. This transaction, recorded at 20:31 (UTC) yesterday, originated from an anonymous wallet and has attracted attention across the SHIB community. Burning reduces the circulating supply, theoretically boosting the value of remaining tokens based on basic supply-demand dynamics.The origin of the transaction was later confirmed by Shiro Neko, a new meme coin with a cat theme. Shortly after the burn, Shiro Neko disclosed on X that they initiated the $100,000 SHIB burn as a gesture of goodwill and an attempt to strengthen ties with the Shiba Inu community.

Since its ATH, Bitcoin has been rejected from this resistance level five times, dropping between 8.2% and 18% the four previous times.

The crypto market has declined by 5.68% today, crashing back to $2.28 trillion from the $2.418 trillion peak on Tuesday. Amid the crashing market, Bitcoin has revisited the $69,300 level.¬†Crashing from the 7-day high of $73,600, the BTC price has dropped by 5.84%. With a correction rally at play, will the biggest crypto crash under the $68k mark? Find out now!Bitcoin Tests Crucial 4-hour Support¬†On the 4-hour chart, the recent pullback in Bitcoin is testing a crucial support trendline, which forms a rising channel pattern. The bearish correction began with a double-top pattern near $72,700. After facing rejection above the $73,000 mark, the neckline of the bearish pattern was established at $71,600.Following this double-top breakout, the BTC price has returned to the support trendline near the 38.20% trend-based Fibonacci retracement level within the rising channel. Currently, it is finding support, as indicated by a lower price rejection, hinting at a potential bullish comeback.However, Bitcoin must surpass the 50% Fibonacci level at $70,310 for a sustained recovery. A successful bullish recovery could see Bitcoin challenge the peak of the double top at $72,700. Conversely, a drop below the support trendline could trigger a significant sell-off in Bitcoin.The next crucial support levels to watch in case of a decline are $67,500 and the $65,000 mark.Analyst Ali Martinez Targets $78kDespite the sudden crash, widely followed crypto analyst Ali Martinez retweeted his recent analysis, which predicted a minor pullback to $69,000. Highlighting the number 69 in his recent tweet, Martinez¬†reiterated an analysis that revealed if Bitcoin stood above $65,000, a price jump to $72,000 was possible.¬†However, he also highlighted that a pullback to $69,000 is possible before starting a bullish trend to $78,000. As the first three variables of Martinez's prediction stand true, is the next potential target for Bitcoin standing at the $78,000 mark?¬†Well, the trend-based Fibonacci levels in the 4-hour chart predict the next all-time high near $75,620. Meanwhile, an extended rally could target $82,183, or the 161.80% Fibonacci level.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/01/amid-bitcoin-dip-analyst-insists-on-78k-as-next-target-can-btc-reach-this-level/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=amid-bitcoin-dip-analyst-insists-on-78k-as-next-target-can-btc-reach-this-level,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Recent market data shows that 28,000 Bitcoin options with a notional value of approximately $2 billion became worthless today, November 1, at a max pain of $69,000. The expired Bitcoin options contracts have a notable put-call ratio of 0.92. This implies there were almost as many put options (bets on a price drop) as call options (bets on a price increase).Bitcoin Dips to $68KThis development in the derivative market coincided with Bitcoin crashing to as low as $68,779 early today, reflecting a massive intraday drop of 5.34% from the daily peak value of $72,662. This correction follows Bitcoin's four consecutive daily green candles this week, during which it traded at lofty levels last seen in March.At press time, Bitcoin has yet to recover, continuing to trade below the $70K level, which dampens the bullish sentiment in the market.$350 Million in Ethereum Options ExpiredBitcoin‚Äôs pullback has also impacted the market sentiment around Ethereum. Today, the ETH derivative market saw 137,000 options expire, with a put-call ratio of 0.69 and a max pain at $2,550. The expired Ethereum contracts have a notional value of $350 million. This figure is nearly six times lower than the amount of Bitcoin options that expired today.Ethereum's Poor Performance Relative to BitcoinNotably, Ethereum registered a more dramatic drop of 6.8% today, falling from $2,647 to $2,467. Interestingly, while Bitcoin traded near its all-time high this week, Ethereum lagged significantly, only reaching $2,720‚Äîover 44% below its all-time high. In March, Ethereum traded in the $4,000 range when Bitcoin was at $73,000. Essentially, Ethereum‚Äôs performance against Bitcoin has worsened over the last seven months, failing to capitalize on Bitcoin‚Äôs uptrend as it historically has.In fact, in October, the gap between Bitcoin and Ethereum reached historic levels, with Bitcoin leading ETH by over $1 trillion. That gap has continued to widen ever since.Now that the crypto market sentiment is becoming bearish, market watchers are pinning hopes on the U.S. elections taking place next week for a potential bullish sentiment, contingent upon Americans electing a pro-crypto president.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/01/bitcoin-options-worth-2-billion-expire-worthless-as-btc-dips-to-68k/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bitcoin-options-worth-2-billion-expire-worthless-as-btc-dips-to-68k,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

42415692,WEE6jQWt4rgJorpzkntxrA,1730450746,Harris Odds Rise on Polymarket as 'Election Fraud' Allegations Ramp Up Trump Hedge Bets,"On Polymarket, Kamala Harris' odds of winning the U.S. presidential election have increased from 33% on Oct. 30 to nearly 39%. Donald Trump's have dropped 61%.  The increase in Harris' odds might be due to traders hedging their bets, with trades above $10,000 suggesting both large bets on Harris and strategic trading to protect against a Trump loss.  Reports of voting irregularities against Trump could be influencing market bets.  The odds on Democrat candidate Kamala Harris winning next week's U.S. presidential election are rising on betting platform Polymarket, with some observers suggesting the increase reflects hedging positions among traders who've also bet on a victory for her Republican rival, Donald Trump.  Harris‚Äô odds have risen to almost 39% from 33% on Oct. 30. Trump's odds dropped in tandem, suggestive of lower expectations of him winning, though at 61%, he's still the preferred candidate. Some market watchers attributed Friday‚Äôs crypto market slide to Trump‚Äôs slump on Polymarket: The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) has dropped 4.4% in the past 24 hours.  Polymarket is fundamentally a betting market place where users can buy ‚Äúshares‚Äù in the outcome of any prediction, winning $1 per share if the outcome occurs. If a Yes share for an event costs $0.60, the market interprets this as a 60% chance of the event occurring.  The odds are dynamic, changing with each trade. Polymarket works on a blockchain-based order book that lists all the buy (bid) and sell (ask) orders for shares in an outcome, similar to how any asset exchange works.  The market's relatively low liquidity can induce wild swings in prices, with one large purchase briefly driving Trump shares up to 99% last week.  The increase in the price for Harris‚Äô shares could reflect traders buying them as a hedge on their Trump bets, market observers say, as some allege reports of voting irregularities pitted against Trump that could influence market bets. The change may also reflect results from traditional polls, with three new surveys showing Harris leading Trump in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Winsconsin, Newsweek reported Friday. Trump needs to win at least one of those to gain the White House, Newsweek said.  At current prices, a $10,000 punt on a Harris victory could equal a $25,000 payout if she wins. That's a 150% return on capital. For large holders of Trump‚Äôs win shares, a bet on Harris‚Äô win acts as a hedge.  Polymarket data shows a flurry of activity in trades of more than $10,000 in the past 12 hours with large amounts of Harris ‚Äúyes‚Äù shares and Trump ‚Äúno‚Äù shares being purchased.  Clumpyclumsy, a Polymarket user who joined in October, has alone purchased over $250,000 in Harris ""yes"" shares since early Friday.  Some users on X also pointed out an arbitrage opportunity for traders participating in various election-based markets.  ‚ÄúTheres a great arbitrage at the moment if you can access both Robinhood Securities and Polymarket,‚Äù noted @Kevin_Bolger. ‚ÄúYou can load a bag on Trump on Robinhood, another on Harris on Polymarket and whoever wins, you win - assuming transaction fees dont eat the difference. Big difference between both.‚Äù  Such market activity comes as Trump and allies allege election fraud in key states, claiming voting irregularities even as local election officials push back.

This raised the price tremendously from $0.25 to $1.75, representing a spike of 600%.¬†Given the massive surge in the price of egg futures, the investor moved to sell all 2 million contracts only to discover that he had been the only buyer of the asset, making him the egg man.¬†Notably, Schiff is suggesting that Saylor might find himself in the same situation as the egg man due to his aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy. ""Michael Saylor is the Egg Man,"" Schiff remarked.Previous Criticism¬†The financial commentator has been a major critic of Saylor and MicroStrategy due to their heavy exposure to Bitcoin. In August, he warned that this exposure might crash MicroStrategy below its competition over the next four years.¬†Schiff issued the forecast after Saylor claimed MicroStrategy‚Äôs stock had soared 995%, surpassing other assets like S&P 500, Gold, and Bonds since August 2020.¬†Additionally, Schiff forecasted earlier this year that MicroStrategy‚Äôs ‚Äòleverage buying‚Äô of Bitcoin might eventually lead to its doom.¬†Saylor and MicroStrategy Remain Bullish on Bitcoin¬†Despite Schiff‚Äôs negative projections and comments, Saylor has continued to lead MicroStrategy‚Äôs Bitcoin acquisition spree.

Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Key Support To Set A $6,000 Target ‚Äì Analyst Rise In Funding Rates To Drive Breakout? Positive funding rates imply that there are more aggressive buyers, indicating bullish sentiment, whereas negative rates suggest more sellers and a bearish outlook. This trend reflects a favorable market sentiment for Ethereum, albeit with some caution regarding its sustainability. Despite this renewed optimism, the current positive funding rates for Ethereum, as highlighted by Shayan are yet to match levels seen in early 2023, when the cryptocurrency experienced a marked bullish trend in March. This difference may indicate that, although sentiment is shifting, the momentum may need further strengthening to ignite a sustained rally. Shayan observations suggest that while traders lean towards a positive outlook on Ethereum, this sentiment must translate into higher funding rates to indicate a stronger conviction in the asset‚Äôs potential price rise. The analyst wrote: For Ethereum to overcome key resistance levels and sustain an upward trajectory, a higher funding rate would signal increased buying interest and confidence from futures traders. Higher funding rates would not only confirm participants‚Äô willingness to go long on Ethereum but would also add upward pressure on the price, potentially leading to a stronger and more sustained rally. Ethereum Market Performance Ethereum has seen a noteworthy recovery in price in recent weeks. The asset has recorded a price uptick rising to as high as $2,719 on Wednesday. However, following the asset reaching this price mark comes a noteworthy correction. Over the past day, ETH has decreased by 5.1%, shedding some of the profits in the past few days. At the time of writing, the asset trades at $2,550 from its 24-hour low of $2,548. ETH‚Äôs daily trading volume has also followed the same trend, dropping from above $24 billion on Wednesday to below $20 billion. Regardless of this performance, some analysts remain bullish on ETH.

DeFi and CeFi both have different roles to play, and the market needs both he argues.  HONG KONG -- Regulations and increasing demand for consolidated products could propel growth in the niche decentralized finance sector (DeFi), one that's stuck in a market lull in the past year but could have its ‚Äúinternet‚Äù moment as retail offerings grow.  That's the view held by Charles D‚ÄôHaussy, CEO of the dYdX foundation, which supports the development of the onchain perpetual trading protocol dYdX ‚Äì one of the first such platforms that currently boasts $266 million in locked value, according to DeFi Llama data, and has a $674 million market capitalization by token value.  Read more Consensus Hong Kong-related coverage here.  D‚ÄôHaussy spoke to CoinDesk at the sidelines of the Hong Kong Fintech Week earlier this week, predicting growth in the DeFi market to be similar to the internet's recent years - where people interact mainly using application instead of web explorers or browsers.  ""The internet, in my opinion, is becoming the split internet, with walled gardens...People don‚Äôt go to web explorers; they go into apps,‚Äù he said in an interview with CoinDesk. ""The internet‚Äôs evolution into silos shows a massive change in how web products are distributed, and DeFi needs to follow users into these spaces.""  D'Haussy sees parallels between the regulatory evolution of the internet and DeFi.  In the 1990s, regulators struggled to understand and control the decentralized nature of the internet, seeking a ""CEO of the internet"" that didn‚Äôt exist, and eventually shifted focus to regulating access providers like AOL and ISPs, he explained.  While DeFi operates as an open, unpredictable financial ecosystem without central control, regulators will not target the protocols themselves but will instead focus on centralized finance (CeFi) platforms and other gateways as points of regulation, he argued.  ‚ÄúThe distribution of DeFi is evolving. CeFi could fill the gaps by providing a bridge for users who want decentralized options within regulatory limits. When Binance or another exchange enables a non-custodial wallet, it lets users do more with DeFi than CeFi regulations alone allow,‚Äù D‚ÄôHaussy said.  And once the market figures out how to integrate CeFi and DeFi, working out the regulatory and technical challenges, we‚Äôll have the future of finance, he concluded. Where will this happen? Probably in Hong Kong ‚Äì one of crypto‚Äôs most strategic and important hubs.  This series is brought to you by Consensus Hong Kong.

The Fear and Greed Index indicated ""extreme greed"" on Thursday, potentially signaling a market top. By Friday, the index showed ""greed,"" suggesting further price corrections might occur.  Nearly 90% of the futures positions were long (expecting price increases), highlighting a bullish market sentiment before a sharp correction.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} price fell nearly 4% in the past 24 hours amid continual profit-taking ahead of the weekend, causing a wider market retreat that led to over $250 million in bullish bets liquidated.  BTC fell from $72,500 early Thursday to just over $69,000 early Friday, paring down gains made by the token since Monday. Other major cryptos fell in tandem, with overall market capitalization falling 5.5%.  Meanwhile, the widely-watched Fear and Greed Index, a sentiment and volatility tracker for the crypto market, flashed ‚Äúextreme greed‚Äù levels on Thursday, historically a sign of local tops.  The index aims to measure emotional responses in the crypto market, highlighting that extreme fear might present buying opportunities, while extreme greed could signal an upcoming market correction. The index is flashing ‚Äúgreed‚Äù as of Asian afternoon hours Friday - suggesting prices could correct further.  The price caused pain for futures traders. Bets on BTC-tracked futures recorded $88 million in losses, CoinGlass data shows, followed by $44 million in liquidations on ether {{ETH}} futures and nearly $15 million in losses each on SOL and DOGE futures.  Nearly 90% of all futures bets were bullish, or expecting higher prices over the weekend ahead of the U.S. elections on November 5. Market conditions in the past few weeks, including global monetary policies and U.S. political support, indicated a continued bullish trend, with some traders targeting $80,000 for BTC in the coming weeks.  A liquidation occurs when an exchange forcefully closes a trader's leveraged position due to the trader's inability to meet the margin requirements. Large-scale liquidations can indicate market extremes, like panic selling or buying.  A cascade of liquidations might suggest a market turning point, where a price reversal could be imminent due to an overreaction in market sentiment.

35448769,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=650948,1730442648,BlackRock‚Äôs Bitcoin ETF Reaches 2% Of Total BTC Supply Amid Record Inflows,"On Wednesday, BlackRock, the world‚Äôs largest asset manager, achieved a significant milestone in the Bitcoin ETF market, recording the largest inflows since the inception of these investment funds in January. Bitcoin ETF Demand Soars Ahead Of US Presidential Election According to Bloomberg, approximately $872 million flowed into BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Bitcoin Trust on Wednesday, marking a daily record for the fund. This influx highlights the strong demand for Bitcoin ETFs, with subscriptions for this nine-month-old product ranking among the highest globally for ETFs in 2024. As a result of the inflows, BlackRock‚Äôs total holdings in Bitcoin now stand at 429,185 BTC, valued at approximately $31.04 billion. This accounts for about 2.04% of Bitcoin‚Äôs total supply, capped at 21 million coins. The recent inflows are being attributed to a phenomenon dubbed the ‚ÄúTrump trade,‚Äù as pro-crypto Republican nominee Donald Trump gains momentum in betting markets ahead of the upcoming election day on November 5. Related Reading: BNB Price Slips as Peers Climb: Can It Regain Ground? Bitcoin is on the verge of reaching new heights, fueled by a 13% rally in October. James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, noted on Bloomberg Television that the demand for these ETFs is palpable, suggesting that investors are responding not only to Bitcoin‚Äôs upward momentum but also to Trump‚Äôs favorable odds in the political arena. Trump has made headlines with his pledge to turn the US into the ‚Äúcrypto capital of the planet‚Äù and to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the country to halve the US‚Äôs $35 trillion national debt. In contrast, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, has pledged to support a regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency industry but has not provided further details on how her potential new administration will address the community‚Äôs calls for a change in leadership at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its approach to digital assets. Price Predictions Surge Amid bullish predictions for the leading crypto of the industry, market expert Ali Martinez has shared compelling insights regarding Bitcoin‚Äôs potential price trajectory for the months ahead. In a recent post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Martinez analyzed historical patterns, noting that Bitcoin has typically peaked between the 1.618 and 2.272 Fibonacci retracement levels during past bull cycles. If this trend continues, Martinez predicts that Bitcoin could reach a price range between $174,000 and $462,000 in the current cycle. Related Reading: Analyst Says It‚Äôs ‚ÄòTime To Be Bullish On Ethereum‚Äô As ETH Retests $2,700 In addition to these price predictions, Martinez pointed to another bullish indicator: a significant outflow of Bitcoin from cryptocurrency exchanges. Over the past 48 hours, approximately 8,000 BTC, valued at around $576 million, have been withdrawn from exchanges. This trend signifies a growing inclination among investors to hold onto their Bitcoin rather than sell it, which can create upward pressure on prices as BTC inches closer to its all-time high level of $73,700 reached in March. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $71,640. This represents a retracement of 1.2% over the past 24 hours.

42373451,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllNTQN,1730437429,"Justin Sun Wants More TradFi on Tron, Dogs Over Cats for Memecoins","In an interview with CoinDesk, Justin Sun explained why memecoins are more fair than VC-backed tokens, how traders are having better memecoin returns on HTX rather than Binance, and the importance of bringing Chainlink to Tron's DeFi ecosystem.  He also said that he has a slight preference for dog memecoins rather than cat memecoins. Research from CoinGecko shows there's a market preference for cats over dogs.  HONG KONG ‚Äì Getting a sit-down interview with Justin Sun is a difficult process. Logistics are coordinated at the same scale as if he were a head of state, and Sun's schedule at a conference is organized down to the minute.  Booking Sun requires a secure room; there were visits by advance teams to walk through it and a sweep from security.  When he arrived, there was an entourage, including guards, to push onlookers out of the way  CoinDesk got 20 minutes with Sun on the sidelines of Chainlink's SmartCon during Hong Kong Fintech week to talk about everything from why memecoins are more fair than VC-backed tokens, as well as why Chainlink is bringing more TradFi to Tron.  Along the way we asked if he's a dog or a cat person, as the memecoin market demands.  This interview has been edited and condensed. Read more Consensus Hong Kong-related coverage here.  On the fairness of memecoins  CoinDesk: Do you think memecoins are more fair than venture-capital-backed tokens? There's been plenty of criticism on how these tokens only enrich the elites and leave retail traders diluted.  Sun:Fair launch is one of the biggest advantages of meme coins. Everyone can track the tokens, and if anyone moves large amounts of assets without the community knowing, the price will drop significantly.  We‚Äôve seen instances called ""rug pulls"" when this happens. Fair distribution and fair launches are key. I tell memecoin developers on Tron that if they want to be at the top, they need to ensure fair launch and distribution.  CoinDesk: There has been a shift in market structure with major cryptocurrencies and tokens like bitcoin, Ethereum and Tron, as well as memecoins and VC coins. Do you see this trend continuing over the next two years, with a focus shifting back to the community?  Sun: I definitely see people focusing back on the community. It‚Äôs very impressive.  Recently, HTX has launched memecoins on our platform, and most have had great returns ‚Äì around 100% or more.  If you look at Binance, their coin returns are actually very low, even though Binance has a stricter listing strategy compared to Tron.  For Binance, you need to prepare for about half a year just to get listed. The main tokens listed there are VC-backed, and their performance has been disappointing, often declining by 50% or more. If you bought a VC-backed coin at launch on Binance, you probably lost a lot of your investment.  But with HTX, there are no listing fees, and we list tokens we believe have a strong community. New coins on HTX can see returns up to 500x.  HTX is focused on meme tokens, and you can see the trend difference. Speed is also crucial. Meme coins can capture attention quickly, and I study memecoin trends daily.  The narratives change constantly, keeping things exciting and never boring. One day it might be a new Elon Musk meme coin, the next an a16z coin, or even religious, AI or art-themed memecoins. New meme concepts are always emerging.  CoinDesk: With memecoins, are you a dog or a cat person?  Sun: I'd say like 60% dog.  Bringing more TradFi onto Tron  On Thursday at SmartCon, the Tron DAO announced its participation in the Chainlink Scale program, adopting Chainlink Data Feeds as the official data oracle solution for its DeFi ecosystem, a $6.9 billion universe according to data from DeFi Llama, which is important for DeFi apps that rely on outside data feeds like like JustLend and JustStable.  CoinDesk: Tell us more about Tron's recent announcement with Chainlink.  Sun: We‚Äôve been preparing this collaboration with Chainlink for a long time. I‚Äôm happy we completed this before the smart contract launch.  Chainlink is the top smart contract oracle in the world, and Tron has over $60 billion in stablecoins and active DeFi and real-world asset (RWA) applications. This partnership can empower traditional financial institutions to enter the Web3 space through our stablecoins and applications. Chainlink plays a crucial role in this.  CoinDesk: Do you expect more traditional finance (TradFi) to join Tron after Chainlink‚Äôs integration?  Sun: Definitely. Tron‚Äôs stablecoin is a critical infrastructure, especially in Asia. Today, if you visit any crypto or even fiat exchange store, you‚Äôll see Tron USDT is widely used.  Many people who don‚Äôt fully understand crypto still have Tron addresses for receiving stablecoins. With Chainlink‚Äôs integration, more users will gain access to fiat gateways, which will benefit on-chain users and merchants across Asia.  CoinDesk: Why are stablecoins so prominent on Tron compared to Ethereum? There's more USDT issued on Tron than Ethereum.  Sun: Stablecoins on Tron are significant because many people in Asia use them as a fiat gateway to enter the crypto space or to move assets.  CoinDesk: What are your plans for 2025?  Sun: Our main priority at the end of this quarter is USDD [Tron's stablecoin]. Recently, Dai migrated to USDS, moving away from a decentralized model. USDD aims to fill that gap as a decentralized stablecoin.  We‚Äôll upgrade the USDD smart contract system by the end of the year, adding new functions to enhance decentralization and make it a stablecoin option for everyone.  Alongside the Chainlink collaboration, we‚Äôll work with DeFi developers and major players like Aave. For memecoin trading, we‚Äôll also collaborate with developers to launch new projects, including AI memes, by the end of this year and early next year.

35444507,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=650954,1730437236,TRON Reclaims Its Crown With 43% Dominance In Altcoin Transactions,"The TRON network has been making a notable impact across altcoin ecosystems, regaining its position as the leading blockchain for transaction volume among major altcoin chains. According to a CryptoQuant analyst known as ‚ÄòMaartuun,‚Äô TRON has shown substantial transaction dominance recently, handling roughly 43% of transactions across major altcoin blockchains as of October 30. This recent spike has pushed TRON to the top position for transaction processing in October, surpassing other major altcoin networks and highlighting its relevance in the current crypto market. Related Reading: Expert Picks 5 Altcoins To Watch, Declaring Arrival Of The Altseason After Three Years Deciphering TRON‚Äôs Transaction Dominance Data shared by maartuun reveals that in October alone, TRON processed approximately 230 million transactions, marking a significant activity surge. On October 24, the network peaked, handling 10.46 million transactions, around 25% higher than its 30-day average. This activity level reflects TRON‚Äôs increased usage, aligning with its performance in 2024, when it frequently led in transaction volume. However, between late August and early October, TRON‚Äôs transaction dominance slightly waned, with other networks experiencing temporary spikes in activity. TRON‚Äôs return to the forefront suggests the asset is reclaiming its crown and maintaining its status as a ‚Äúhighly utilized‚Äù blockchain network for altcoin transactions. The CryptoQuant analyst‚Äôs observations suggest that TRON‚Äôs current dominance in transaction volume is likely to persist. This trend is supported by historical data, showing that TRON has maintained strong transaction levels over extended periods. It is worth noting that the network‚Äôs current transaction share indicates a broader shift within the blockchain industry toward networks that offer scalability and low fees, essential factors for sustaining high transaction rates. TRON‚Äôs ability to handle many transactions daily sets it apart from many other altcoin platforms, adding to its appeal and supporting its adoption within various blockchain-based applications and projects. TRON Market Performance While TRON‚Äôs on-chain fundamentals appear to be doing well, the network‚Äôs native token (TRX) market price performance can also be said to have seen positive movements in recent weeks. Particularly following the ubiquitous price increase in the crypto market led by Bitcoin, TRX has followed the overall bullish trend, increasing by 5.6% in the past fortnight and 3.1% in the past week. Related Reading: Crypto Expert Discloses ‚ÄòHidden Altcoin Gem‚Äô With 1,900% Upside However, the asset‚Äôs price performance in the past day isn‚Äôt all that positive. Over this period, TRX has faced a slight correction, falling from its 24-hour high of $0.1705 to a price of $0.1684 at the time of writing. While TRX‚Äôs price has seen an uptick, its daily trading volume seems to be recording an opposite trend. In the past few days, this metric has decreased from over $600 million seen last weekend to below $500 million.

35442237,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=650935,1730433611,"Bitcoin Set To Gain If Trump Wins, JPMorgan Cites ‚ÄòDebasement Trade‚Äô As Key Factor","According to JPMorgan analysts, a win for the Republican US presidential candidate Donald Trump could further fuel Bitcoin (BTC) price momentum. Retail Investors Turn To Bitcoin For ‚ÄòDebasement Trade‚Äô In a recent client note, analysts at JPMorgan suggested that a Trump win might provide ‚Äòadditional upside‚Äô for both BTC and gold, as retail investors increasingly view Bitcoin as a ‚Äòdebasement trade.‚Äô Related Reading: Bitcoin Makes ATH Against Euro Due To Change In Dollar Strength, Details Inside In simple terms, a debasement trade is a strategy to protect purchasing power against the steady erosion of fiat currencies due to extensive money printing. Notably, the M2 money supply ‚Äì a measure of total money in circulation ‚Äì sharply rose during the coronavirus pandemic. This surplus in money supply led to heightened inflation, forcing the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) to raise interest rates to contain it. By purchasing BTC, retail investors aim to maintain their money‚Äôs value, hoping Bitcoin will act as a hedge against currency depreciation. The JPMorgan note states: Retail investors appear to be embracing the ‚Äòdebasement trade‚Äô in an even stronger manner by buying bitcoin and gold ETFs. The retail impulse is also seen in meme and AI tokens the market cap of which has outperformed. Data from SoSoValue shows that Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) have attracted a whopping $1.3 billion in inflows over the past two days alone. As of October 30, the cumulative net inflow to US-based spot BTC ETFs is $24.18 billion. October‚Äôs total ETF inflows alone amount to $4.4 billion, marking it the third-highest month for BTC ETF inflows since their launch earlier this year. However, institutional investors appear to have slowed down on BTC futures activity recently, with analysts noting that Bitcoin futures have entered overbought territory, potentially introducing vulnerability for BTC‚Äôs near-term outlook. The client note highlights that credit and prediction markets lean toward a Trump win, unlike equities, foreign exchange (FX), and rates markets. The analysts conclude: Overall, to the extent a Trump win inspires retail investors to not only buy risk assets but to also further embrace the ‚Äòdebasement trade‚Äô, there could be additional upside for bitcoin and gold prices in a Trump win scenario. Where Is BTC Headed? Analysts Share Their Outlook Bitcoin is trading within 2% of reaching a new all-time high (ATH), driving renewed optimism among crypto analysts. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Demand Rises 13% In 1 Month: Time For Q4 2024 Rally? For instance, crypto analyst Timothy Peterson recently posited that BTC could surge to as high as $100,000 by February 2025. Meanwhile, crypto options trading data indicates that traders remain confident BTC will hit $80,000 by the end of November 2024, regardless of the election outcome. Veteran trader Peter Brandt, however, has urged caution, advising BTC bulls that a daily close above $76,000 is critical for confirming a true breakout. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $71,798, down 0.1% in the past 24 hours.

Coinbase CEO Armstrong Commits $25M To Fairshake Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong confirmed the investment during the company‚Äôs third-quarter earnings call, stating, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to slow down post-election. We know we need to have pro-crypto legislation passed in this country.‚Äù Fairshake, which has garnered backing from major players in the digital asset sector, including Ripple Labs and Andreessen Horowitz, aims to ensure that both Republican and Democratic candidates recognize the importance of cryptocurrency in their platforms. The committee is poised to spend over $40 million in the lead-up to the 2024 elections, having already invested $140 million in various congressional races across the nation. Related Reading: Analyst Claims Ethereum ‚ÄòIs Not Dying,‚Äô Bitcoin Surge No Threat To Ether In the current political climate, Republican nominee Donald Trump has shifted his stance on cryptocurrency, now embracing the industry after previously labeling it as a scam, with promises including firing the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair Gary Gensler and Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset for the nation.

Analysts Call Current Crypto Market Dip A ‚ÄòTemporary Unwind‚Äô Coinbase shares dropped 14.3% on Thursday, marking the steepest decline since May 2022. This downturn was exacerbated by a broader market decline and disappointing earnings from other crypto-related firms, including Robinhood, which saw its stock tumble 15% after reporting weak results. However, analysts are viewing the current market conditions as a temporary setback. Devin Ryan of JMP Securities described the situation as a ‚Äútemporary unwind‚Äù in crypto stocks, suggesting that long-term investors may find opportunities amidst the volatility. The analyst further pointed out that upcoming events‚Äîsuch as the US elections and rising crypto prices‚Äîcould positively impact Coinbase‚Äôs fourth-quarter revenue if trends continue. Related Reading: Institutional Traders Bet On Bitcoin Exceeding $79,300 By End Of November Owen Lau, an analyst at Oppenheimer, also noted that the recent stock decline might be tied to concerns about subdued trading volumes and the potential impact of lower US interest rates on Coinbase‚Äôs stablecoin revenue.

OG, short for ‚Äúoriginal gangster‚Äù or ‚Äúoriginal gangsta,‚Äù is a slang expression for someone who is exceptional, unique, or ‚Äúold-school.‚Äù The BTC supporter also suggested that the coin is moving in the direction that will allow the crypto to outshine gold, the US dollar, and other major assets soon. Related Reading: Tether‚Äôs $1 Billion USDT Mint On Tron: What‚Äôs Fueling The Demand Surge? Rising Over Gold, Greenback ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees, an early investor of Bitcoin, sees that the cryptocurrency would surpass the major assets in the upcoming months, saying that the coin has ‚Äúhigh potential‚Äù to eclipse fundamental assets such as gold, the US dollar, and even oil. When demand for gold rises, more gold is produced. When demand for oil rises, more oil is produced. When demand for USD rises, more USD are produced. When demand for Bitcoin rises‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Erik Voorhees (@ErikVoorhees) October 29, 2024 In a post, Voorhees pointed out that when the appetite for gold rises, gold production will surge while if the demand for oil rises, more oil will be extracted. He added that more US dollars are printed, once the demand for the greenbacks soar, saying that supply for these assets would not run out in the upcoming years. However, the founder of the Venice.AI project hinted that it is not the same case with Bitcoin when demand for it increases. It is an indication that additional BTC cannot be produced because Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, only designed the cryptocurrency not to exceed 21 million coins. Bitcoin-Gold Relationship Earlier, another Bitcoiner, Max Keiser, believed that there is a relationship between the price of gold and Bitcoin price, saying that BTC price could soar because of gold. Keiser explained that for every $1 increase in gold prices, BTC prices also experienced a hike of $20, adding that since gold prices hit a record amount, Bitcoin prices are more likely to follow suit. Expecting A Bitcoin Surge Voorhees is already telling the cryptocurrency community to keep an eye on Bitcoin because he predicts that all aspects of the coin will move upward including its price. The ShapeShift executive remarked that this attribute of Bitcoin would be the main factor why demand for the coin will soar quickly. In the past few days, several crypto experts have already projected the inevitable growth of Bitcoin, saying that its price will breach the six-figure level. Related Reading: Cardano To Soar 22X?

In a series of posts on X, Robinson highlighted how blobs could revolutionize Ethereum‚Äôs scalability and economic dynamics. ‚ÄúMany people arguing about blobs, but so far no one has simulated how they respond to demand‚Ä¶ until now,‚Äù Robinson stated. ‚ÄúTL;DR: Blobs are insanely bullish for ETH long term.‚Äù Why Blobs Are ‚ÄòInsanely Bullish‚Äô For Ethereum Price Blobs, introduced in Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-4844, are large data structures designed to enhance the network‚Äôs capacity by efficiently storing and processing data off-chain. This mechanism is pivotal for Layer 2 (L2) scaling solutions, enabling them to offer lower transaction fees while maintaining security through Ethereum‚Äôs consensus. Related Reading: Ethereum Bullish Signal: Whales Withdraw $750 Million In ETH From Exchanges Robinson‚Äôs simulation projects Ethereum operating at 10,000 transactions per second (TPS), burning 6.5% of its total ETH supply annually, with L2 transactions costing an average of $0.06. This scenario involves 16 MB of blobs per block, aligning with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin‚Äôs medium-term goals outlined in his latest ‚ÄúThe Surge‚Äù post. ‚ÄúYes, that‚Äôs Ethereum operating at 10k TPS, burning 6.5% a year while L2 transactions cost an average of $0.06, with 16 MB of blobs per block,‚Äù Robinson elaborated. ‚ÄúYou thought L2‚Äôs were parasitic and Vitalik didn‚Äôt think this through? Ah, sweet summer child, little do you realize how insane this will get when the Ethereum ecosystem really kicks into high gear.‚Äù A key insight from Robinson‚Äôs research is the rapid escalation of ETH burning as blob usage increases. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs interesting how quickly blobs go from being free to burning a ton of ETH. It seems almost everyone doesn‚Äôt understand this tipping point. It also makes me think there might be a better pricing mechanism,‚Äù he observed. Robinson provides a simulation tool illustrating the ETH burn rate‚Äòs exponential growth as TPS scales from the current ~180 TPS to 400 TPS. The data shows burned ETH increasing from roughly 4 ETH per day to 1,832 ETH per day. It‚Äôs interesting how quickly blobs go from being free to burning a ton of ETH. It seems almost everyone doesn‚Äôt understand this tipping point. It also makes me think there might be a better pricing mechanism. Here‚Äôs what it looks like increasing from today‚Äôs ~180TPS to 400TPS pic.twitter.com/fjuK19NL6y ‚Äî Tim Robinson (@timjrobinson) October 29, 2024 The scalability potential is further enhanced by the implementation of Peer Data Availability Sampling (PeerDAS), which allows blob capacity to scale with the number of validators. ‚ÄúBecause total blob capacity scales with total validators, after PeerDAS is implemented, blobs can scale as high as needed,‚Äù Robinson explained. ‚ÄúThere are 10k+ nodes to shard the load between them. While other ecosystems struggle under load, Ethereum will supply the world with cheap, abundant block-space while being extremely deflationary.‚Äù Related Reading: Ethereum Prepares For Potential Rally To $6,000, Analyst Says An intriguing feedback loop identified by Robinson is the inverse relationship between ETH price and the burn rate. ‚ÄúAnother interesting feedback loop is the lower the ETH price, the higher the burn! As transaction prices are lower, more transactions are made, and the burn soars,‚Äù he noted. ‚ÄúSee how different the burn is with ETH at $2k vs ETH at $10k‚Äù. Another interesting feedback loop is the lower the ETH price, the higher the burn! As transaction prices are lower, more transactions are made, and the burn soars. See how different the burn is with ETH at $2k vs ETH at $10k: pic.twitter.com/tbSbC6unwM ‚Äî Tim Robinson (@timjrobinson) October 29, 2024 Addressing the question of value accrual for ETH, Robinson stated, ‚ÄúSo how will ETH accrue value? Being the most useful, scarce, deflationary asset with 10,000+ teams using Ethereum to grow their products will probably do it. Long term, ETH has the best fundamentals in the world; it just takes time for them to play out.‚Äù The research sparked enthusiasm and discussions within the ETH community. Mat (@materkel) commented on X: ‚ÄúWill be extremely interesting once we hit blob capacity. My guess is a lot of L2s still need to figure out how to handle this case and properly fee their users. There will be a lot of inefficiencies to fix; we just didn‚Äôt really have multiple competing L2s in this scenario before. Once the dust settles, we‚Äôll have proper price discovery both for fees on L2s together with blobs on L1.‚Äù Robinson responded, emphasizing the importance of proactive analysis: ‚ÄúYeah, absolutely! I‚Äôm trying to bring the data so we can solve any problems before we get there. The market becomes more stable with more blobs, but in the early days, fees could be quite volatile.‚Äù At press time, ETH traded at $2,638.

Recent bearish pressure has driven the token to a point where a recovery might be on the horizon, yet the critical question is: can buyers defend this level and push prices higher? With momentum shifting and market sentiment in flux, the scene is set for either a breakout on the upside or a breakdown. This article aims to analyze ApeCoin‚Äôs resilience at a critical support level, exploring whether current market dynamics could spark a rebound. Through a breakdown of technical indicators and recent price action, we seek to analyze the possibility of a bullish reversal or signs of continued downward pressure on ApeCoin. Technical Analysis: Signs Af A Rebound Or Breakdown? APE‚Äôs price on the 4-hour chart is consolidating above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the key $1 support level, indicating market indecision. While the position above the SMA suggests an optimistic trend, this consolidation could lead to a rally or strong decline, depending on whether bulls or bears take control. Meanwhile, the 4-hour Composite Trend Oscillator for ApeCoin shows bearish signals, as its SMA line edges toward a crossover below the signal lines near the zero level. This crossover attempt is typically seen as a bearish indicator, suggesting that downside momentum may be gaining steam. A successful crossover below the signal lines could confirm a shift in trend, potentially signaling more selling pressure on APE in the near term. Related Reading: Is Apecoin On Your Radar? APE Soars By 30% In 48 Hours, Signaling A Potential Bull Run On the daily chart, APE is in a consolidation phase while showing downbeat strength as it nears the $1 mark.
