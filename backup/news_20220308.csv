Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is preparing a bill to make it more difficult to use cryptocurrency to circumvent sanctions.  In a tweet on Tuesday, Warren says her new bill will “ensure crypto isn’t used by Putin and his cronies to undermine our economic sanctions,” referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin.  According to NBC News, which was the first to report on Warren's proposed bill, one of its provisions would make it easier to verify customer identities and transfers to private wallets by requiring financial institutions to log detailed records and submit reports to the Treasury Department.  Warren and three other Democratic senators sent a letter last week to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen asking about how the Treasury Department plans to enforce economic sanctions within the cryptocurrency industry.  “Strong enforcement of sanctions compliance in the cryptocurrency industry is critical given that digital assets, which allow entities to bypass the traditional financial system, may increasingly be used as a tool for sanctions evasion,” the senators wrote.

42395883,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASzgPu,1646776035,Ukrainian Deputy Minister Reiterates Call for Crypto Exchanges to Block Russian Users,"Amid an ongoing war, a Ukrainian official reiterated his demand that crypto businesses cut services to Russian users as part of an unprecedented effort to block Russia from the global financial system.  Alex Bornyakov, Ukraine’s deputy minister at the Ministry of Digital Transformation, said crypto is just a marginal part of the Russian economy now – and likely not a tool for evading sanctions – but could grow more important as the economic blockade continues.  “It’s not their main option,” Bornyakov said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover.” Still, ""with the sanctions being imposed, crypto will take more and more popularity,” he said.  See also: Crypto Still Isn't Helping Russian Oligarchs Evade Sanctions  Ukraine has seen a flurry of crypto donations – over $80 million at press time – since the invasion began two weeks ago. These funds are reportedly being spent on non-lethal equipment, including fuel, food and bulletproof vests for soldiers.  “Crypto became even more convenient than the banking system,” Bornyakov said.  As CoinDesk has reported, Ukrainian-based crypto exchange Kuna is primarily handling these crypto-charitable efforts on behalf of the country’s government. But it’s hardly Ukraine’s first exposure to the blockchain industry.  Last year, the Ukrainian government launched concerted efforts to attract a local crypto industry that was part of a push to further digitize the economy. In September, the Parliament passed a law legalizing and regulating bitcoin. The country has low taxes, crypto-friendly regulations and a highly educated and young workforce.  Russia, by comparison, has made strong attempts to minimize crypto use in the country. Its central bank has called for a ban on crypto trading outright, though the Ministry of Finance has published a roadmap for regulating it.  Despite this aggressive regulatory stance, crypto has found a foothold in the country. Russia is home to a large domestic crypto mining industry and sees some of the highest transaction volumes in the world, according to analytics firm Chainalysis.  Bornyakov said that eight official letters were sent to crypto exchanges asking them to block, freeze or cancel operations for Russian users altogether. So far, major crypto exchanges have been hesitant to do so.  Binance, Coinbase and Kraken, for instance, have all said they would blacklist specific companies and oligarchs targeted by Western sanctions but would not cut off services to the entire country unless ordered to do so.  See also: 'Crack Down' on Crypto? Maybe, but You Can't Ban Math  “If we see crypto being used to avoid sanctions, this will put more pressure” on crypto exchanges to geoblock Russia,” Bornyakov said.

42395866,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASzgB9,1646775826,"As Gold Nears Record, Bitcoin Doesn't Shine So Brightly","Gold is suddenly attracting all the attention, with the yellow metal's price nearing a record of over $2,000 an ounce as the Russia-Ukraine war escalates.  Now, crypto investors are asking what it might mean for bitcoin (BTC). After all, the largest cryptocurrency by market value has been cast by some analysts in recent years as a potential rival to gold and its perceived status as a ""safe haven.""  The answer is that bitcoin is still viewed as a technological innovation whose performance as a global macroeconomic asset is still in question.  “The uncertainty levels are off the scale at the moment,” said Jason Deane, an analyst and adviser at Quantum Economics. “The default setting is, ‘Go with what you know,’ which in this case means gold.”  Gold prices have climbed about 8% in the past two weeks, while bitcoin has barely budged during Russia's invasion of Ukraine that developed into a full-scale war.  Crude oil prices shot past $120 a barrel when U.S. President Joe Biden announced plans to join the U.K. in banning Russian imports of fossil fuels. Gasoline prices are jumping along with the price of commodities from nickel to palladium and wheat. Stocks have tumbled as risks mounted to the global economy.  “Everyone has been just jumping on the gold trade,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst with Oanda. ""Bitcoin is sitting this rally out.""  “It is behaving more like a risk asset and it is starting to follow the moves of equities more than these high-flying commodities,” Moya said.  The gold buff Peter Schiff, a well-chronicled bitcoin skeptic, couldn't resist chiming in on Tuesday:  Lucas Outumuro, head of research at IntoTheBlock, told CoinDesk: “It seems like investors are treating bitcoin and gold very differently, with their correlation dropping to the lowest in over six months.”  “Bitcoin is still being priced as a risk asset and not yet as the safe haven many once thought it would be,” Outumuro added.  Some analysts believe bitcoin may eventually come to be accepted as a safe haven, and its current correlation with the stock market will prove temporary.  “Bitcoin is still a nascent asset technology, and it's going down because of that,” said Mike McGlone, senior commodity strategist for Bloomberg Intelligence. “But it's in transition from a risk-on asset to a risk-off asset. That's what I see happening.”  Lyllah Ledesma contributed to this article.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | FIAT | MARKET,Angelique Chen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/08/as-gold-nears-record-bitcoin-doesnt-shine-so-brightly,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/72be438a58f5b1577f640f581232d5df6cb83dec-640x480.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42395882,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASzgQt,1646774656,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Stabilizes Ahead of Biden's Executive Order on Crypto,"Bitcoin (BTC) has held above its $37,000 support level over the past 24 hours, albeit within a tight trading range and with low volume.  Still, later this week, an executive order by U.S. President Biden that will outline the government’s strategy for cryptocurrencies could be a source of volatility for bitcoin.  ""The executive order has been known about before the war in Ukraine and was originally intended to mainly address stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDC),"" Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at U.K.-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. ""However, due to the increased concerns of Russia using crypto to evade sanctions, many are worried that the order will impose strict regulatory changes that will hinder the crypto industry.""  Elsewhere, Bloomberg reported that European officials are planning a joint bond sale to finance energy and defense spending. For now, talks are informal, but analysts expect a the spending could reduce investor concerns about an economic slowdown stemming from inflation and geopolitical woes. News of the potential bond sale contributed to an uptick in the euro versus the U.S. dollar during the London trading day.  On a positive note, regulatory filings show that large institutions such as ARK Investment Management and Morgan Stanley have been buying shares in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which is trading at a record 30% discount.  Demand from investors, plus million dollar buybacks from Digital Currency Group, which is the parent company of both Grayscale and CoinDesk, could mean that stakeholders are still hoping that the trust will receive regulatory approval to convert the close-ended fund into a spot-based exchange-traded fund.

Key support levels  Bitcoin is 43% off its all-time high of nearly $69,000 in November and is down about 8% over the past month. Typically, extreme price declines encourage buyers to return in hopes of catching a bargain ahead of the next market rally.  Support levels can help traders identify price levels where a downtrend can be expected to pause because of a concentration of demand or buying interest. Once a support level is held and a break above resistance is confirmed, upside momentum tends to accelerate, setting the stage for an upcycle.  The chart below estimates the average cost basis (realized prices) among bitcoin investors, which aligns with key technical support levels.  Most short-term bitcoin holders are at a loss, having a cost basis of around $46,400, according to data compiled by Glassnode. Long-term holders, however, have an estimated break-even point of about $39,200, which, if broken, could yield further downside toward $24,000.  Sell-offs are typically driven by short-term holders, whereas long-term holders are likely to accumulate along major support levels, similar to what occurred during the 2019 and 2020 price bottoms. So far, it appears that BTC is roughly halfway through a bear market phase.

42411494,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOS97,1646773257,AssangeDAO Raised $56M and Quickly Split Up. Was It Still a Success?,"Someone recently told me that decentralized autonomous organizations, more commonly known as DAOs, have so far led to more philosophizing than building. At the most basic level, a DAO is just a way to organize people toward a collective aim. They’re often called “internet forums with a shared bank account,” or quasi-corporations built on blockchains or governance structures for crypto projects.  Some predict DAOs might evolve into a new type of public infrastructure: massive investment projects run neither by companies nor governments.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Considering this wide range of activity, it seems appropriate to ask: When is a DAO successful and how do you measure that? The most notable DAO to date, ConstitutionDAO, failed in its aim to buy a copy of the U.S. Constitution, despite raising far more money than the document was worth. SpiceDAO has also been stymied in its attempt to buy a “Dune” storybook and monetize it.  Last December, following a legal proceeding that opened the possibility for political activist Julian Assange to be extradited to the U.S, a collective called AssangeDAO was founded. Its explicit aim was to “free” the dissident WikiLeaks founder, who spent several years locked up in Ecuador's embassy in London before being put behind bars in a U.K. prison.  The DAO is taking something of a circuitous path towards freeing Assange. Last month it raised ​​17,422 ether (about $56 million at the time) to bid on a non-fungible token (NFT) project that would then funnel funds towards charitable efforts supporting Assange’s legal case and (unlikely) release, run by the Wau Holland Foundation.  “This is an important moment in DAO history,” Rachel-Rose O’Leary, a core contributor of AssangeDAO (and CoinDesk writer), said at the time. The NFT project, called “Censored,” was created by influential conceptual artist Pak in collaboration with Assange and his family. The DAO bid on that collection’s big-ticket item, a one-of-one NFT called “Clock,” which tracks the number of days Assange has spent in prison.  In this limited ambition, AssangeDAO was clearly effective. It raised a significant amount of capital to be put towards Assange’s case. It drew support from a number of high-profile figures, including Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin and Gnosis founder Martin Köppelmann, as well as hundreds of small donors. Assange’s fiancee, Stella Morris, and one-time collaborator, whistleblower Edward Snowden, showed their enthusiasm for the project. And, after all, the DAO did buy the NFT – achieving its goal.  See also: What Do DAOs Actually Do?  Leaderless  But AssangeDAO quickly came up against roadblocks. In the run-up to the NFT auction, I began speaking over Telegram with a number of its key stakeholders – including some that held part of the multi-party key to unlock the DAO’s treasury and other founding members. They were ebullient, enthusiastic. They called themselves a “leaderless organization” that sprung up “spontaneously” to free Assange. Early bitcoin proponent Amir Taaki was there, along with pseudonymous developer McKenna and notable crypto lawyer Silke Noa.  They were an anarcho-collective with a utopian dream, and they’d seen some early success. That private channel has since been deleted, perhaps an indication of the group fracturing soon after.  According to O’Leary, there was a “fairly major disagreement” about how to spend the DAO’s millions – it raised far more than anyone anticipated. There were two camps, she said, those that wanted to “maxbid,” or spend its entire reserves buying Pak’s NFT. Others wanted to keep some cash on hand to finance future campaigns looking to free Assange “by all means necessary.”  “The tension emerged in the keyholders first,” O’Leary said, who placed herself in the camp against maxbid. She, like some of her colleagues, was inspired by FreeRossDAO – a similar project that raised charitable funds to bid on an NFT benefiting the founder of the Silk Road online marketplace – and wanted to keep AssangeDAO as a going concern.  Being diplomatic, O’Leary said that maxbid was the “default strategy.” Both Pak and Julian Assange’s brother and a core contributor of AssangeDAO, Gabriel Shipton, wanted that option, and their voices carried a lot of weight, even in a supposedly leaderless organization. The key holders began posting on the AssangeDAO forum, leaving documentation of the organization’s disassembly.  “All of the key holders had this much in common: We wanted to execute the will of the DAO. However, the interpretation of what this … differed, and we lacked the mechanism to properly measure it,” O’Leary said. “Resolving such differences is difficult in a low-trust environment,” and it ultimately “tore” the community apart, she added. Notably, few of the DAO’s founders had ever met in person.  Soon, concerns spread through the AssangeDAO community. Low-ranking members began posting proposals to return ETH to donors. That led to further concerns about when a “snapshot” should be taken, or the moment on-chain that they can revert back to – like turning off a game and resuming at your last save. This itself was complicated by the fact that founding DAO members decided to exit the project.  The DAO is still operating. It has approximately $600,000 in crypto in its treasury. People are posting proposals to clean up the community’s website, to set up an annual reward for freedom fighters called the “Julian Assange Award,” to host a hackathon to build a “censorship resistant” blog. It may even donate crypto to fund Ukraine’s defense. But the fundamental problems of running the DAO have yet to be resolved.  Just this morning, someone posted a “fourth snapshot proposal.” Yesterday, there was a call to elect a community “administrator” and a “moderator.” Almost all of the founding members of the so-called “leaderless” project have stepped back, leaving the community to try to chart its course alone. Further fractures between the “Chinese community” and the rest of the DAO have formed.  Decentralized organization  O’Leary says there are a few hard lessons to learn. First, the DAO’s non-leaders should have “clarified the bidding strategy” prior to the auction. She also said they should have launched the DAO’s governance token, JUSTICE, earlier to “collect community opinion on the bidding strategy.” (JUSTICE has since distributed to ETH donors and was trading on open crypto exchange Uniswap but is currently unavailable.)  “Token voting would not necessarily have reduced conflict – it would have exposed the conflict, give it voice and definition,” she said. “As multisig holders, we needed this community feedback to make a decision.”  See also: ENS and the Limitations of DAO Governance | The Node  But the DAO, despite being a little pocket of protest, was not a democracy. Assange’s family was given veto power over proposals, and certain voices always carried more weight. There was a founding collective that was in a privileged position, despite calling themselves “cypherpunks” and anarchists. Community members raised concerns about transparency and leadership early on, and it's possible these tensions would have remained had the DAO stayed together – even with a token.  “DAOs are unproven to the vast majority of the world,” Amir Taaki wrote in a post following the controversy. AssangeDAO’s ultimate aim – freeing Julian – was always unlikely. He faces extradition and up to 125 years in prison. He’s accused by the U.S. government of sedition (never mind that he’s an Australian citizen).  In all, O’Leary still thinks the movement was a major achievement. The DAO was quickly able to assemble and raise funds. It is also still operating, and nearing a solution for its continued governance framework.  “In my view, a DAO is a DAO when it captures community sentiment and enables large-scale coordination around a topic,” she said. It might not matter if DAOs are any more democratic than nations, any more organized than message boards, if they can just stay almost undefined.  CORRECTION (MAR. 9, 2022 – 21:30 UTC): Amir Taaki has not officially stepped down from the DAO, as previously stated.

42421663,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXothN,1646771400,Crypto Still Isn't Helping Russian Oligarchs Evade Sanctions,"Where are the sanctions-evading crypto use cases? Surely by this point we’d see something around that, right?  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Uncensorable  The narrative  One of crypto's purported use cases is as an uncensorable, stateless means to store and transact value. We're sort of seeing that play out in Ukraine. We aren't seeing another use case play out at all in Russia – at least, not yet.  Why it matters  Crypto faces another defining moment as lawmakers and users literally worldwide consider its uses – real and potential – in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It will be an interesting test for the sector.  Breaking it down  This particular newsletter originated on Saturday night when I was getting drinks with my colleague Danny Nelson (if you don't already read him, you should).  We have heard a lot over the last week that crypto is not being used to undermine international sanctions against Russia or breakaway regions of Ukraine, and my question is: Why on Earth not? The whole idea of crypto is that it is supposed to be a stateless form of money or store of value, one that allows you to maintain your fiscal resources outside of the government or outside of any government entity. It's supposed to be a flight to safety when normal payment rails cut you off or make it difficult for you to keep on as you were.  (Note: I’m not advocating for people to evade sanctions using crypto, just sincerely asking why it isn’t happening.)  Evading sanctions would seem to be a perfect use case for this, no? And yet this doesn't seem to be happening on any appreciable scale. The U.S. government has even gone out of its way to say this isn’t happening. Todd Conklin at the U.S. Treasury Department recently told TRM Labs' Ari Redbord in a webinar that crypto isn’t being used as a tool to evade sanctions, at least not in Russia at this time.  The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the Treasury Department’s money-laundering watchdog, supported that view yesterday by publishing a statement warning that while individuals might turn to cryptocurrencies to bypass sanctions, the Russian government doing so “is not necessarily practicable.”  Part of that is because the industry just doesn’t have sufficient liquidity to meet the needs of a sovereign nation, Redbord later told me.  For a country, that would be hundreds of billions of dollars. The entire crypto market cap is about $2 trillion.  Furthermore, the Russian government has put precisely zero effort into creating the necessary infrastructure to operate a crypto-based alternative to its current dollar economy. (In fact, the Russian central bank appears to have kept quite a bit of its war chest in dollars in offshore accounts that have now been seized.)  I’ve written about this before (a few times now). There are any number of reasons why crypto doesn’t fill the sanctions-shaped hole in Russia’s economy.  But what if we look to individuals, such as, say, the dozens of Russian oligarchs who now find themselves on the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control's Specially Designated Nationals list? Surely, they will be turning to crypto to evade sanctions; ri–no, wait, it seems that they, too, are not using crypto in any appreciable scale at this time.  Certainly, we saw a spike in ruble-bitcoin trading pairs on crypto platforms operating in Russia immediately after the invasion was announced, but volatility in that corner of the market seems to have calmed down (relatively speaking) over the last week or so.  It is, of course, certainly possible that these oligarchs might be using over-the-counter trading desks or other trading pairs (especially plausible if their wealth is held in assets that aren’t the ruble).  A quick look at the bitcoin-ruble price change shows why that might make sense.  The ruble’s value has plummeted compared with other currencies since the start of the invasion. One U.S. dollar was worth around 84 rubles the night the invasion began, according to TradingView. As of Monday night, it was worth around 131 rubles, down from 154 rubles earlier in the day. So what the charts above are really telling us is that the ruble isn’t worth a lot now.  The irony here is this will probably affect everyday Russian residents more than the oligarchs (like how Visa/Mastercard/American Express/PayPal’s cutting off Russia will likely affect everyday residents more than the oligarchs).  And despite that, it seems clear that oligarchs aren’t fleeing the ruble for bitcoin.  “We’re not seeing the large types of inflows we would see that would be indicative of inflows of large amounts of money that would correspond to a significant amount of an oligarch’s net worth,” said Salman Banaei, head of public policy at Chainalysis.  That doesn’t mean these individuals or their families might not turn to crypto in the future. Redbord said the sanctioned oligarchs are likely to use every tool they can to try to hold onto their wealth, which is being seized around the world.  ""We've seen sort of shell companies and different complex laundering schemes over the years,"" Redbord said. ""They will use absolutely everything that they can and crypto will be part of that playbook, at least in some small way.""  Banaei said he would look for inflows into privacy-enhanced cryptocurrencies like montero or wallet addresses tied to exchanges with weak know-your-customer enforcement as some possible signs that people might be trying to evade enforcement officials.  The chief way to track fund movements would be to link addresses to individuals directly, Redbord said.  To be sure, crypto has been used to great effect as a fundraiser for the Ukrainian government. So far, $60 million worth of crypto has been donated over the past couple weeks. Those funds are being converted into fiat or being accepted as payment by some vendors, according to a government official.  The official, Deputy Minister for Digital Transformation Alex Bornyakov, told 3,200-plus listeners in a Twitter Space yesterday that the crypto donations are coming in faster than fiat donations (literally faster, as in they take less time to process than interbank transactions). Still, fiat donations have far outpaced crypto – $280 million-$300 million versus the $60 million in crypto.  Still, it feels like we've crossed the Rubicon. It's felt like that for a while, since last year's infrastructure bill, really, but we're now in a moment where crypto is being used as a key tool in an international war. Lawmakers are repeatedly asking if the aggressor can use crypto to bypass the economic warfare being used to convince Russia to stand down. Finance ministers in different countries are saying they need to have a contingency plan in case that happens.  The White House has suddenly revealed it's going to finally announce the long-awaited executive order on crypto regulation.  For many, many reasons, it feels like this is crypto's moment (yes, I’ve written this before, too). Either the sector can meet it and validate its existence amid the massive shifts in how the world sees the status quo financial system, or it can't, and those who say the industry is nothing more than a glorified casino for the 21st century have another example to point to.  Or, in the words of the great Joe Weisenthal:  A shout-out to CoinDesk Research's Edward Oosterban and Sage Young for the charts and data in today’s newsletter.  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  We continue to wait for votes on the Fed board nominees.

The IRS filed a motion to dismiss, saying that the refund went through and can’t be refused and that the suit shouldn’t continue.  On Chinese Social Media, Justin Sun Says He Hopes to 'Strengthen Cooperation' With Russia: Justin Sun, the Tron founder turned diplomat, tweeted about donating to Ukraine in English in the early days of the invasion. On his Chinese social media feeds, he also spoke about strengthening cooperation with Russia in a post noticeably absent on his English feeds. Sandali Handagama runs through the discrepancy and what some of Sun’s followers had to say.

42395868,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASzgE6,1646769726,CFTC Brings Charges Against 4 Alleged Operators of $44M Bitcoin Ponzi Scheme,"A U.S. federal regulatory agency has filed a civil enforcement action against four individuals it said were involved in the operation of two crypto Ponzi schemes that collectively defrauded investors of $44 million worth of bitcoin (BTC).  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has charged Florida resident Dwayne Golden, North Carolina resident Marquis Egerton, New York resident Gregory Aggesen and Indian citizen Jatin Patel with fraud for their roles in the alleged scheme.  Separately, the same three U.S. defendants were indicted in a federal court in New York by the Justice Department on criminal charges of wire fraud and money laundering.  During his Senate confirmation hearing last year, CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam said his agency was ready to become the “primary cop on the beat” for crypto regulation, and reminded the Senate Agriculture Committee the CFTC has “responsibly and aggressively been pursuing enforcement cases in the digital asset marketplace for a number of years.”  Tuesday’s charges are just the latest in the CFTC’s efforts to regulate the crypto industry, the source of its ongoing turf war with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has historically taken the lead on U.S. crypto regulation.  According to the CFTC's complaint filed Tuesday, the four defendants and an unnamed accomplice worked together on two schemes that operated from roughly April 2017 to August 2017.  Golden, Patel and Egerton allegedly ran Ecoinplus (aka Empowercoin), a Ponzi scheme that took in over $23 million in bitcoin (valued at the time of investment), nearly $10 million of which they “misappropriated” and kept for themselves.  Investors were told their money would be invested by “professional traders” and would double in value in 50 to 90 days while accruing at daily payments of at least 2% to 5% of the investment. According to the CFTC, Golden, Patel and Egerton relied on new incoming payments to keep these promises, all while lining their own pockets.  In July 2017, Ecoinplus’s website went offline. Customers did not receive refunds.  Not done yet  Before giving up on Ecoinplus, however, the CFTC alleges that Golden and Patel found a new business partner in Aggeson, a New York entrepreneur, and an unnamed accomplice. Modeling the new site on Ecoinplus (and taking steps to distance themselves from the Ecoinplus scheme), they created JetCoin, according to the regulator.  Aggeson, whose LinkedIn profile lists him as an “internet marketer,” allegedly roped in a crew of “experienced multi-level marketing promoters” who recruited new customers to the scheme.  Much like Ecoinplus, the JetCoin website promised customers a “100% success rate!”, a doubling of their investment in 40 to 50 days, and the accrual of 4% to 5% of their investments daily – all thanks to the investing skills of “the sharpest minds in the industry.”  But JetCoin had no other employees besides Golden, Patel and Aggeson, according to the CFTC.  The defendants allegedly took in $21.7 million in bitcoin from the JetCoin scheme, 36% of which they kept for themselves. The JetCoin website went offline in August 2017 and its customers did not receive refunds.  According to the CFTC complaint, the JetCoin team knew the entire time the system wouldn’t last and that it was only built for “quick money.”  “People who want to sit by and earn money without doing anything … no one believes in that crap,” the unnamed accomplice allegedly told Aggeson, according to recovered voicemails included in the CFTC complaint.  Aggeson responded by saying that “this whole thing about coming in and putting your money into something and making money for nothing, that’s such a joke.”  The CFTC is seeking restitution, disgorgement, civil penalties and permanent bans on registration and trading.  If convicted of the separate criminal charges, the defendants each face up to 20 years in prison.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/08/cftc-brings-charges-against-4-alleged-operators-of-44m-bitcoin-ponzi-scheme,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3fc6db12e88ae86ef4303b591eb130e38bb6284b-720x406.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

How prices react at $5.85 could shape the near-term trend. Past Performance PancakeSwap (CAKE) is trading at near-record lows at the time of writing. CAKE is down 50 percent from January 2022 peaks in a bear breakout pattern. As per the CAKEUSDT formation in the daily chart, there are no signs of sellers slowing down. PancakeSwap Technical Analysis The path of least resistance is southwards at spot rates. CAKE bulls are yet to shake off determined sellers. Although there are higher highs relative to the lower BB as CAKE prices stabilize, the reaction at $5.85—this week&apos;s lows—could determine the short to medium-term trend. On the more positive side, a reaction above $7 may draw buyers, especially if the breakout is with rising volumes. In that case, CAKE may rise to February 2022 peaks of around $8.70 in a buy trend continuation pattern.

He spoke during Royal Bank of Canada's global financial institutions conference Tuesday afternoon.  While cryptocurrencies may be quite useful in emerging markets where cash can be “dangerous,” Kelly said, he’s unsure of their role in nations like the U.S. and Canada.  Nevertheless, he added, Visa will continue to play a role in the industry and ultimately leave it to its customers to decide whether crypto makes sense for them. In the fourth quarter last year, Visa users made $2.5 billion in payments with crypto-connected cards, up sharply from previous quarters.  In addition to payments, Kelly said that Visa is facilitating purchases of cryptocurrencies, creating a utility for crypto via stablecoin providers and enabling financial institutions and fintechs to offer crypto access and custody.

Past Performance The Uniswap token is snapping back to trend after immense selling pressure from late last week. From the development in the daily chart, UNI is up by seven percent on the last trading day, outperforming the USDT. However, the short-term trend depends on confirmation of today&apos;s gains and reaction at $8. Uniswap Technical Analysis There are hints of strength reading from the UNIUSDT formation in the daily chart. The bullish engulfing pattern from $8-a critical support level-could be the base for another leg up in a welcomed recovery. Notably, the spike in the NY session is with high trading volumes suggesting demand. As such, aggressive traders may load the dip above $8, targeting $10 in the medium term especially if UNI bulls push prices above the multi-week resistance trend line clear in the daily chart. What to Expect of Uniswap? Overall, sellers are still in a commanding position despite what DeFi brings on board. Based on the UNIUSDT candlestick arrangement, losses below $8 could see UNI prices tank to $7 in the near term.

The &apos;exchange reserve&apos; is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin stored in wallets of all exchanges. When the value of this metric rises, it means exchanges are observing net inflows right now. Such a trend can be bearish for the price of the coin as it represents an increase in the sell supply of the crypto. On the other hand, when the reserve&apos;s value decreases, it implies outflows are overwhelming the inflows at the moment.

42421655,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXota9,1646764447,You Would Understand Bitcoin if You Were Under Cuba’s Embargo,"My name is Erich Garcia Cruz and I am a 35-year-old programmer. I don't have a bank account or PayPal, and I don't use a Mastercard or Visa credit or debit card. More than 60 banks and payment platforms have rejected me.  Why? Because I was born and currently live in Cuba, a country that since 1962 has been under an economic embargo imposed by the United States, which prevents American businesses, or those structured under U.S. law, from doing business with Cuba.  Lee este artículo en español.  You are probably reading these lines in a country that has all kinds of financial solutions to send or receive payments. Banks, maybe, offer you discounts or better interest rates to attract your money. And you may even enjoy the luxury of opening accounts offered by global financial services such as PayPal or Wise.  Cubans do not have that privilege. Fintech companies like Venmo, Wise, Stripe and Revolut instantly block any Cuban startup or person from using them.  Making matters worse, Western Union, the last service available for Cubans living abroad to send money to their families, suspended U.S. dollar transfers to Cuba in November 2020 after sanctions by then-President Donald Trump’s administration.  Cuban businesses are also seriously affected by the embargo because they cannot receive payments through global platforms such as PayPal, Mastercard or Visa.  All these restrictions, however, have become a fertile ground for cryptocurrency in Cuba. Before crypto, no tool had been as effective in breaking through an embargo that predates the internet itself.  Cubans may not have Visa or Mastercard, but they have PayWithMoon, which allows us to fund a prepaid virtual card with bitcoin (BTC). They can't use banks, but found in bitcoin a public peer-to-peer bank. They are not accepted by Stripe, the ubiquitous internet payment network, but can make transfers in seconds through Bitcoin’s Lightning Network.  Crypto, the only option  There are no crypto exchanges in Cuba that allow buying crypto with Cuban pesos. The only way to achieve this is through WhatsApp or Telegram groups.  In general, sellers and buyers coordinate an amount and price through messages and then must rely on pure trust. The crypto buyer will deposit Cuban pesos in a bank account and wait for sellers to keep their word and deposit bitcoin in the indicated wallet. Sadly, scams through these platforms are common, and buyers often receive nothing.  People have to do it that way because crypto exchanges like Coinbase, Binance and OpenNode instantly block crypto users because they need to comply with the embargo.  For businesses, it is impossible to use payment gateways to automate the sale of a book or a simple delivery service in Cuba over the internet, unless a business owner has a relative, friend or business partner abroad who can do that with a non-Cuban identity.  Bitcoin fixes this.  As of now, Cuban stores must have a personal wallet to accept bitcoin payments because they provide customers with a QR code to receive transactions. If bitcoin payment automation platforms such as OpenNode were available in this country, local businesses could automate payments both online and in person. But, due to the embargo, that has not happened so far.  In 2019, I jumped into bitcoin and created QvaPay, a company that allows Cubans to receive and send remittance payments through the Bitcoin network at high speeds and with low fees. As of today, the service has more than 48,000 users who find crypto the only way to move money.  I spend my days trying to promote bitcoin across the island. With a few friends, I created Cuba es Bitcoin, the first meeting of crypto entrepreneurs, artists and enthusiasts on the island. Our first event took place in February in Havana.  Here is a prediction: I believe Cuba will experience a kind of hyperbitcoinization in the private sector, a phenomenon that has already been happening organically and simply through the acceptance of bitcoin in businesses, such as restaurants, cellphone repair stores and delivery merchants.  Businesses that receive crypto as a form of payment often save in crypto or pay for supplies to another business with crypto. Also, they buy things in the U.S. through platforms such as Bitrefill or PayWithMoon. They can also convert crypto to Cuban pesos to buy supplies within the country.  Although there is no official data on crypto adoption in Cuba, I estimate there are now more than 20,000 Cubans using crypto on a daily basis. As many as 200,000 people have owned a wallet or used crypto at some point. QvaPay and Bitremesas, two companies I created, have sent crypto to more than 150,000 wallets so far. The numbers might seem tiny (up to 40 million American adults have invested or traded crypto), but given our financial obstacles, there is great potential for growth.  Crypto has also gotten onto the radar of the Cuban government. In August, the Central Bank of Cuba authorized the use of certain virtual assets for commercial transactions and the granting of licenses to virtual asset service providers, for the purpose of carrying out certain financial activities, such as the collection of payments.  It’s understandable that companies must obey local laws – in this case, the embargo imposed by the U.S. – and exclude Cubans from using their services. But this also prevents these companies from offering payment systems that empower their users economically.  The good news is that bitcoin is not subject to these same laws or geographical restrictions; it doesn’t care about embargoes.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | BNB,Erich García Cruz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/08/you-would-understand-bitcoin-if-you-were-under-cubas-embargo,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f2b863566538c1b7e5c9223585537050e35e4199-2400x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394542,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwBX7d,1646763420,How to Buy Ether,"Ether (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, the world’s second-largest crypto project after Bitcoin and the foundation of countless other crypto protocols. Here is a rundown of the most popular ways to buy ETH.  How to buy ether on exchanges  Crypto exchanges offer the easiest way for beginners to acquire ETH. Broadly, there are two types of exchanges available to use in the industry:  Centralized exchanges  Decentralized exchanges  Most exchanges are centralized, although there are a growing number of decentralized options. You can read about the pros and cons of each type here. However, because centralized exchanges are simpler to use for first-time investors, we’ll focus on this option for the purposes of this guide.  The first step is to open an account with a centralized exchange. Different exchanges will require you to share different amounts of personal information in order to open an account to deter and catch out fraudulent users. These are called know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) requirements.  Read more: What Is Ether?  Generally, exchanges have been tightening their procedures in this respect in recent years in response to pressure from regulators. Most reputable exchanges will at least require you to upload a photographic ID.  If you are a beginner, it is recommended you use a high-volume exchange like Binance, Coinbase (COIN) or Kraken. These are the exchanges you are most likely to have heard of before.  After you have made an account, your next step is to fund your account. This can usually be done with a bank transfer, a credit card or a payment service like PayPal, depending on what your exchange can support technically.  Now you are almost ready to trade. One last piece of important preparation is to decide how you are going to store your ether once you have bought it. You can store your ETH in an online wallet, often provided by an exchange, or else in your own personal desktop or mobile wallet. The latter option is offline and sometimes called “cold storage.” It is considered safer than an online wallet because it is less vulnerable to bad actors trying to steal it.  It may be quicker and easier to trade ETH for other cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies if you keep it in an exchange-provided wallet, but some prefer to keep complete control over their assets.  Hacks and frauds are the most dramatic examples of the risks involved. For example, a hacker stole cryptocurrency worth around $196 million from the exchange BitMart in December. But there can be more mundane inconveniences too: The exchange Binance had to stop crypto withdrawals for around 25 minutes in November because of a technical problem.  A good rule of thumb is that if you plan to trade frequently, you should keep your ETH in an exchange-provided wallet. If you don’t plan to touch it for long periods at a time, you should keep it in an offline wallet like a Trezor or Ledger hardware device.  Other ways to buy ether  One alternative to buying through an exchange is to buy directly from other individuals. This can be organized by an over-the-counter (OTC) trading service. The big exchanges generally have OTC desks of their own. The Kraken OTC desk, for example, is a separate service from the Kraken exchange.  OTC desks appeal especially to institutions and high net worth individuals looking to conduct high-value trades, which would risk disrupting the operation of an exchange. For example, high-value exchange trades can incur a cost called “slippage,” meaning that not all the tokens can be bought at the expected price. This is a greater danger for higher-value trades on exchanges. An OTC desk can provide a personal service to make such large trades work.  Some stock brokerages offer crypto trading as well as traditional assets. Robinhood (HOOD) was a pioneer in this respect. These brokerages are often compared with exchanges and they offer a similar experience to their customers, meaning they generally compete for the same kind of people. This includes customers with less experience and less capital to throw around.  There is one other popular way to buy ETH: You can use an ether ATM. These are machines that you can walk up to in person, just like traditional automated teller machines. You can search for the locations of ether ATMs in your region and then buy the ETH by putting fiat cash into the machine and having the tokens transferred into your crypto wallet. You can also sell ETH this way and take cash out of the machine. If you have cash and you want ETH, an ATM saves you from putting it through the traditional banking system first.  What to consider before you choose how to buy ether  One of your biggest concerns when choosing how to buy ETH will most likely be fees, which can vary significantly from platform to platform. Exchanges and brokerages advertise their fees very boldly for this reason, but it is important to bear in mind they are trying to win you over as a customer. You should make sure to read thoroughly about different platforms’ fee structures.  Read more: What Are Ethereum Gas Fees?  Of course, it might seem simpler and less “centralized” to leave all these companies out of it.  Can’t you just find somebody willing to sell their ETH to you, then send the person some fiat currency and wait for them to transfer the tokens to your wallet? This is perfectly possible, but it can also be riddled with risks. Meeting up with strangers in those circumstances would be unwise in any case, and it may be difficult to enforce the terms of any agreement you reach with them. If you are not very experienced, it is probably safer to use a well-known platform.

42394531,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwBWXj,1646761278,"What's a DeFi Wallet, and How to Choose the Right One","Decentralized finance (DeFi) offers investors the opportunity to participate in novel and diverse markets, like non-fungible token (NFT) art and exotic derivatives. To play the game, however, you’ll need a non-custodial DeFi wallet.  Non-custodial DeFi wallets replace the log-in screens of Web 2 platforms that let you sign into a new site with your Facebook or Google account. Web 3 wallets are interoperable across all major DeFi protocols and, within limits, across blockchains, too.  There are plenty of Web 3 wallets from which to choose, and weighing up the pros and cons of each one can be an arduous task. Here’s a simple guide to help you get started.  What is a DeFi wallet?  A DeFi wallet is a non-custodial wallet that stores your cryptocurrency assets. They are non-custodial, meaning only those with the seed phrase or private key (the equivalent of a password) can access your funds. Governments cannot, for instance, freeze the account – although they might be able to order a token issuer to freeze assets sent to exchanges or render some assets obsolete.  Read more: Your First Crypto Wallet, How to Use It and Why You Need One  Non-custodial wallets diverge from wallets issued by centralized exchanges. There, you sacrifice control over your assets, just like with a bank. The major difference between a bank and a crypto exchange, however, is that deposits to the former are often regulated and insured by government deposit schemes. For instance, Mt. Gox, Quadriga CX and Einstein Exchange have all lost customer funds and left victims struggling to get their money back.  There are, broadly, two types of non-custodial cryptocurrency wallets: hardware wallets and software wallets. The former are created by companies such as Ledger and Trezor. They look like USB sticks (thumb drives) and you purchase them to hold your funds offline (known as “cold storage”).  Software wallets are online wallets that you access through your web browser or your phone. They’re usually free. Popular examples include:  MetaMask  WalletConnect  Rainbow Wallet  This guide will focus on software wallets because they’re the most common way to interface with decentralized finance protocols such as decentralized exchanges, lending protocols and yield farms.  How to choose a DeFi wallet  The first choice you’ll have to make when deciding which DeFi wallet to use is the blockchain on which you plan to use it. For instance, MetaMask, one of the most popular Web 3 wallets, doesn’t natively support the Solana blockchain.  You’ll have to use a wallet like Solflare, Sollet or Phantom to interact with Solana decentralized applications (dapp). Some blockchain applications require their own wallet: play-to-earn crypto game Axie Infinity requires you to use Ronin Wallet, for instance.  You might end up using several DeFi wallets for different purposes – they’re free and quick to set up. Just remember to store your seed phrase – a 12- or 24-word phrase used to access your wallet – safe.  Read more: How to Set up a MetaMask Wallet  Beyond blockchains, wallets come with different features. Some wallets are better at supporting certain assets. MetaMask, for instance, doesn’t visualize the NFTs you hold in your wallet. Others, like Rainbow Wallet, allow you to see the NFTs you hold within your account.  Some DeFi wallets are integrated with decentralized finance applications, allowing you to interact with DeFi protocols or perform trades without having to leave the wallet. MetaMask allows you to swap tokens within its app, and SolFlare allows you to manage staking accounts.  Argent allows you to buy funds with debit cards and stake funds at reduced fees – it uses zkSync’s layer 2 network to reduce transaction costs and is integrated with Yearn, Lido and Gro. Coinbase Wallet, the non-custodial wallet produced by the custodial exchange, is integrated with lending protocol Compound and decentralized derivatives exchange dYdX. It’s also among the most user-friendly of crypto wallets.  Other wallets, like MyCrypto and MyEtherWallet, natively support hardware wallets, making them a good choice if you want to interact with DeFi protocols using crypto held in cold storage.  Some wallets prioritize security. Gnosis allows for multi-signature transactions, or transactions that several people have to confirm at the same time. Argent lets you nominate “guardians” who can help you recover access to your wallet if you forget your private keys.  How to use a DeFi wallet  When you have these wallets installed and funded with crypto, all you have to do to connect to a DeFi protocol is hit “connect wallet.” You’ll usually find the “connect” button in the top right corner of most DeFi protocol landing pages.  Then, you’re pretty much good to go. You’ll have to confirm individual transactions within your wallet and pay for transaction fees using “gas” – or the amount of the native currency for the blockchain you’re using.

""This crisis is not like anything we have seen since President [Richard] Nixon took the U.S. dollar off gold in 1971,"" wrote Pozsar.  Negotiated by 44 countries as World War II was winding down, the Bretton Woods agreement (named for the conference location in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire) pegged gold as the basis for the U.S. dollar, with other currencies then pegged to the greenback. This structure began to fray in the 1960s as U.S. trade deficits became too large to ignore, and it fell apart completely in 1971 when the U.S. abandoned the link between the dollar and gold.  As the initial Bretton Woods era (1944-1971) was backed by gold, and Bretton Woods II (1971-present) backed by ""inside money"" (essentially U.S. government paper), said Pozsar, Bretton Woods III will be backed by ""outside money"" (gold and other commodities).  Pozsar marks the end of the current monetary regime as the day the G7 nations seized Russia's foreign exchange reserves following the latter's invasion of Ukraine. What had previously been thought of as risk-free became risk-free no more as non-existent credit risk was instantly substituted for very real confiscation risk.  What occurred surely isn't lost on China, and Pozsar sees the People's Bank of China (PBOC) faced with two alternatives to protect its interests – either sell Treasury bonds to buy Russian commodities, or do its own quantitative easing, i.e., print renminbi to buy Russian commodities. Pozsar expects both scenarios mean higher yields and higher inflation in the West.  Pozsar concluded his note with a comment about bitcoin (BTC). He expects it to benefit, but only ""if it still exists.""",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Stephen Alpher,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/08/credit-suisse-strategist-says-were-witnessing-birth-of-a-new-world-monetary-order,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/68c0d95feea24ef4d9ad37528b8da941913ddd37-2048x1137.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The art world has seen it many times - consider the notoriety of Banksy, or Andy Warhol. Banksy&apos;s stencil graffiti often depicted the lives of working people and their relationship with consumerism. What could be more relatable than that in our modern times? In the early 60&apos;s, Andy Warhol famously produced 32 canvases, each home to a screen-printed painting of a variety of Campbell&apos;s canned soup which the brand was offering at the time. With the recent rise of NFTs, it seems that Warhol was ahead of his time. The idea of 32 images of soup cans with varying characteristics being minted onto the blockchain as an Opensea Collection doesn&apos;t sound so far from what Warhol actually created back in the 1960s. Artists today who possess this understanding of how people relate to the artwork through common, everyday images have the potential to significantly impact the modern art world, and particularly the world of NFTs. One such artist is Gal Yosef, who did exactly this when he posted a raw and re-imagined 3D design of well-loved cartoon character Donald Duck to his Instagram back in 2020.

42395875,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASzgK0,1646758826,‘Minimum Viable DAO’ Product Looks to Supercharge Web 3 Governance,"Rarely can one speak to an upstart crypto company in 2022 without hearing its plans to start a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). But one company may be ahead of the curve, “firing” some staffers into its own DAO as it rolls out a suite of tools for other projects to get with the times.  Web 3 venture studio Decent Labs announced Tuesday the launch of Fractal – a developer framework that aims to help any company scale up its operations as a DAO.  While there’s no agreed-upon definition, a DAO is generally an organization governed in a decentralized manner on a blockchain like Ethereum. This sounds complex, but it’s typically just a group of individuals who each hold a token that can be used to express an opinion. Token holders can make proposals that are voted on by other members of the DAO; the more tokens a person has (the more “skin in the game,” in crypto lore), the more votes they get.  In its purest form, this marriage between governance proposals and smart contracts gives DAOs the power to do things like move currency from one crypto wallet to another once a proposal is approved, without any action from a central authority.  The most vocal proponents of DAOs herald them as a wholesale replacement for traditional companies. By their telling, the tooling just isn’t there yet.  Parker McCurley, co-founder and CEO of Decent Labs, is one such advocate. “We see Fractal as imperative in proving DAOs are superior to traditional corporate structures just as cryptocurrency has proven superior to fiat,” he said in a statement.  Through its Web 3 accelerator program, Decent Labs has spent the past several years incubating decentralized products in the Ethereum ecosystem. Fractal is the venture studio’s first official foray into product-building under the umbrella of Decent DAO, and with it, the team joins a growing cohort of projects working to make DAO governance practical enough to supplant traditional corporations.  The first Fractal product offering will be the “Minimum Viable DAO (MVD),” which McCurley describes as “a hyper-scalable, composable governance framework” – a stripped-down version of a DAO that can be augmented and adapted to different use cases.  The capabilities of the MVD will be extended by “modules.”  “We don’t care if what you’re doing is forming a proposal, voting, generating fees, defining roles, resetting network variables, forming a partnership with another DAO or signing a contract,” McCurley explained in an interview. “With our module interface, you can create any specific functionality like that, and MVD will translate it effectively into smart-contract operations.”  The team plans to launch MVD to Ethereum mainnet this month.  DAO ambiguity  DAOs were originally proposed in 2014 with the original Ethereum whitepaper and have since been employed for a variety of use cases, from making investments and awarding grants to building communities and managing a decentralized exchange.  DAO advocates forecast a brave new world where payrolls, strategies and hiring decisions across industries are all managed on blockchains by disintermediated communities of contributors and stakeholders.  Maybe you can picture this world if you squint hard enough, but predicting exactly how the day-to-day tedium of managing most companies is supposed to look on-chain can feel like an exercise in pure imagination.  The challenges wrought by these early days of decentralized governance were displayed nowhere more spectacularly than at SushiSwap, a DAO-governed decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol whose behind-the-scenes drama has been more turbulent than the price of its native SUSHI token.  With Fractal, Decent DAO’s chief ambition is to clear up some of the ambiguity surrounding how a DAO should be structured in order to operate most effectively. As such, McCurley explained to CoinDesk that Fractal will be molded by his team’s view on DAO best practices.  “We’re gonna bake in some opinions and best practices on how this organization should be structured, how people should communicate and how we should coordinate work,” he said.",POSITIVE,SUSHI,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | FIAT | SUSHI | TRADING,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/08/minimum-viable-dao-product-looks-to-supercharge-web-3-governance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/17b1eb0abe2d534a711ce411311596c529774d17-3840x2160.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421658,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXotZ7,1646757591,National Security at Stake With Biden's Crypto Executive Order,"The White House reportedly will soon issue an executive order directing agencies across the federal government to conduct a risk analysis and, ultimately, a coordinated approach to digital assets as a matter of national security.  Adam Zarazinski is CEO of Inca Digital, a digital asset data and analytics provider for cryptocurrency exchanges, financial institutions and government agencies, including the Department of Defense. He is a Major in the U.S. Air Force Reserve.  Digital assets like bitcoin (BTC) do introduce risks for immediate U.S. national security objectives that require federal agency action and coordination, but there are deeper, more significant national security opportunities that should drive the U.S. to support the continued growth of the digital asset ecosystem. We managed to strike this balance with internet commerce in the 1990s, and doing so with digital assets should be no different this time around.  National security risks  Just like other technology, digital assets are used to traffic drugs and launder money. Digital asset markets contend with fake trading volumes, wash trading, and pump and dump schemes as they mature. Larger geopolitical forces are also at play: There is evidence that China manipulates the price of cryptocurrencies through its regulatory actions to gain a position of strength toward the implementation of the digital yuan as part of its Belt and Road Initiative.  North Korea steals cryptocurrency to fund its nuclear weapons program. The Putin Regime built Venezuela’s digital asset ecosystem as a test case to further their own goal of creating payment systems independent from Western financial infrastructure, and it will likely move beyond proof-of-concept in the long-term with U.S. sanctions coming online.  All of these pose risks to U.S. national security, and federal agencies need to have better tools to understand how digital assets operate and how to leverage their jurisdictional authority over digital asset markets globally.  National security opportunities  Digital assets also present an opportunity for national security. They can reduce the wealth gap by cutting global transaction costs. They allow people, globally and regardless of socioeconomic status, control over their own money. They can transform international aid and development, foster trade and drive a new sector of small businesses in the U.S. They can reduce fraud and inflationary instability in global markets. And they can revolutionize the global financial system and fostering digital asset innovation will increase U.S. competitiveness in this new era of great power competition.  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a microcosm of these challenges and opportunities. While Russian oligarchs and sanctioned companies might use cryptocurrency to move value globally, Ukrainians have raised millions in crypto to support the defense of their country, and everyday folks on both sides – Ukranians and Russians – are using crypto to soften the financial blowback of the war.  In short: It is in our national security interest to support the development of cryptocurrency.  Clinton’s approach  The U.S. should foster responsible innovation and manage risk similar to how we have in the past. Twenty-five years ago, the Clinton administration built a policy framework for the internet much like the Biden administration will soon do for crypto. The Clinton administration set out a crisp articulation of an open-innovation, market-first vision for the early days of the internet. The policy introduced five principles for the internet that are remarkably relevant to crypto today:  “Innovation … broader participation and lower prices will arise in a market-driven arena.” If the administration focuses on a market-driven approach, in particular where there are partnerships between the private sector and public sector to manage risk and share best practices, innovation will thrive, and lower prices with broader financial participation will result.  Government should avoid undue restrictions. “Government attempts to regulate are likely to be outmoded by the time they are finally enacted.” Risks presented by digital asset services are simply new twists on the same risks presented by other financial services. Digital asset businesses should be subject to the same rules as financial service businesses in other asset classes. Same service, same rules, same legal framework – no more, no less.  Where government involvement is needed, the aim should be to support and enforce a predictable, minimalist, consistent and simple legal environment. While many cryptocurrency start-ups bristle at the thought of government regulation and may decry any attempt to regulate the space, even more want clear rules to access U.S. markets safely and compliantly. Contrasting regulations, particularly between federal and state law, need to be streamlined.  “The genius and explosive success of the internet can be attributed in part to its decentralized nature and to its tradition of bottom-up governance. These same characteristics pose significant logistical and technological challenges to existing regulatory models, and governments should tailor their policies accordingly.” Decentralization and bottom-up governance are core tenets of crypto, and regulatory frameworks are now contending with complicated new digital assets and services, from decentralized exchanges to non-fungible tokens (NFT).  Legal frameworks for e-commerce should be facilitated on a global basis. President Bill Clinton acknowledged that the internet is a global marketplace. Digital assets build on that theme by allowing individuals to transfer value globally in an instant.  These principles do not mean that federal agencies should not act to understand cryptocurrency, regulate the space and enforce laws. They should, and most of them already do. From the Securities and Exchange Commission to the Federal Bureau of Investigation to the Secret Service, they are all working to leverage their jurisdiction in the digital asset ecosystem and have key roles to play in protecting the integrity of U.S. financial infrastructure.  In 2018, I left the U.S. Air Force to start Inca Digital with the goal of bringing large financial institutions and government agencies into the crypto ecosystem. In addition to market surveillance, we collect intelligence on ransomware, hacker attacks and the distribution of blockchain nodes for banks and law enforcement agencies. We even work with the Department of Defense to track the use of cryptocurrencies in illicit supply chain activity and support counter-nuclear proliferation operations.  Ira Magaziner, a prime mover of U.S. internet policy, made an important remark when writing the Clinton policy: The internet “is also a force for the promotion of democracy, because dictatorship depends upon the control of the flow of information. The internet makes this control much more difficult in the short run and impossible in the long run.”  The Biden administration has a limited period of time, a unique opportunity to instantiate its core values of freedom and liberty in what will be a new global financial system. It will be playing into the hands of great power competitors like the People’s Republic of China and Vladimir Putin’s regime in Russia if digital asset innovation here is stifled. It is no secret that China has already incorporated digital assets into its economic and national security policy to increase their competitiveness, kicking off a “horse race” China believes it can win.  To maintain U.S. national security, and America’s place in the global economy, we should look to what is fundamental to America: an open society with bold thinkers and entrepreneurs pushing the limits of the system with responsible technological innovation. That is what we did at the dawn of the internet age, and that is what we should do here.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Adam Zarazinski,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/03/08/national-security-at-stake-with-bidens-crypto-executive-order,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dcd105b12c151227eb147dc6759f889fe6134d91-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394582,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwBXrn,1646754300,Crypto Romance Scams: Don't Fall for These Dating App Swindlers,"The popular Netflix show, ""Tinder Swindler,"" didn’t feature any crypto scams. But its charismatic lead, Simon Leviev, could do perfectly well as a crypto dating scammer – all it takes is some trust building, promises of lucrative crypto gains and gullibility that many of us are prone to.  Indeed, scamming daters out of their crypto has become something of a cottage industry. Romance scammers conned victims out of $139 million worth of cryptocurrency last year, according to a February 2022 report from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).  Crypto romance scammers don’t just target those who are actively looking to date through apps like Tinder, Bumble and Hinge. They may message you on Instagram, or even WhatsApp, and pretend it was by mistake, as a screenshot of what later turned out to be a crypto dating scam shared with CoinDesk shows below.  As these sinister tactics become more and more popular, it’s helpful to be aware of red flags and remain vigilant.  It may not strike you as an obvious scam  Unlike the so-called Nigerian prince scams, where a stranger emails you with an offer of money, crypto dating scams aren’t obvious at first. Research shows that Nigerian prince scammers consciously make their scams glaringly obvious to filter out anyone who wouldn’t fall for it anyways. Crypto dating scammers invest a lot of time in their victims, maintaining a relationship until they feel that trust has been established, and the victim is ready to be exploited.  The majority of crypto dating scams follow the pattern called ""pig butchering,"" or “sha zhu pan” (杀猪盘) in Chinese – so-called because scammers continuously flatter and make their victim feel good before conning them, just like a farmer fattens a pig before slaughter.  In many reported cases, scammers spend weeks or months in a relationship before bringing up crypto and the potential it offers. Anyone who uses the web is at risk of crypto scams – not just those who have crypto investments. In fact, scammers put a lot of effort into walking you through your first crypto purchase through legitimate exchanges like Coinbase or Binance, as the screenshot shared with CoinDesk shows below. Things only go downhill from there.  This type of psychological manipulation is called “social engineering,” and socially engineered crypto scams even target tech-savvy founders of crypto projects.  Not as simple as “don’t send crypto”  Before crypto became the main vehicle of choice for pig butcherers, scammers convinced victims to buy online gift cards. These cards offered less consumer protection than cash transfers – perfect for scammers. Then crypto came, with its promise of self-custody and little to no customer protection – even better!  Some scams are as simple as being tricked into sending crypto to strangers who have built trust with their victims. The old advice of not sending gift cards to online strangers also applies to crypto.  But there are other ways of scamming that don’t even involve the victim directly sending crypto to the scammer.  Lucrative investments through your own account  The Global Anti-Scam Organization maintains a long list of scam websiteshttps://www.globalantiscam.org/list-of-scam-websites-and-links commonly used in pig butchering, many involving crypto. It’s likely the scammer will have you set up an account with one of these sites controlled by their fellow crooks, giving you a false sense of security because the sites feel real.  Scammers may also tell you about lucrative returns through “liquidity pools” or “liquidity mining” in decentralized finance, or DeFi, as the screenshot below shared with CoinDesk shows. They want to help you achieve the same returns, and they’ll only tell you where to invest.  But the scam can also take place on a legitimate crypto site, like decentralized exchange Uniswap.  Under the guidance of your scammer, you may end up investing your funds into coins controlled by scammers. According to a November 2021 study, 50% of all token listings on Uniswap are fake (not necessarily linked with romance scams, of course), so the odds aren’t in your favor when it comes to investing in projects recommended by online strangers. Some of these scam listings even have the same name as major cryptocurrencies – just different smart contracts. Scammers will later dry up the liquidity in the pool you invested in, leaving you with worthless tokens.  Don’t sign unfamiliar contracts with your crypto wallet  In a more advanced form, scammers may help you move crypto from your centralized exchange account, like Coinbase, onto Ethereum through the use of a crypto wallet like MetaMask.  Crypto wallets are a relatively novel technology, and they aren’t the most user-friendly applications suitable to beginners. They won’t show what you’re about to sign in human-readable language, let alone alert you to red flags.  Once you have your crypto on-chain, you’re at risk of getting funds swindled out of your addresses if you sign a malicious contract through your wallet. Approach links you’re sent prompting you to approve through MetaMask with caution - especially when they come from affectionate online strangers who won’t show their face.  Run your due diligence  Victims of crypto dating scams consistently report that their online partner refuses to meet them in person or video call them because they’re shy, and they aren’t ready yet.  In reality, it’s because scammers use photos of other people to create realistic online profiles. Performing a reverse image search of those photos can help you confirm the identity of the person. To do so, download the photo/s of the suspected scammer and try Google’s reverse image search, or TinEye – you can upload the photo and use the camera icon on Google or the upload button on TinEye to search by that image.  If no match comes up, that doesn’t necessarily mean the pictures really belong to that person – the photos could also be harvested from a private social media profile that the scammer had access to.  But some scammers are too clued up to use real people’s photos. They may also use AI-generated photos of humans that don’t exist – just as one scammy crypto project developer did.  As hard as it may be to not trust your heart when you’re looking for love, it’s important to remain vigilant and skeptical, especially if money enters the conversation with anyone you’ve met online, or you’ll not only end up heartbroken, but plain old broke, too.

42394534,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwBWn7,1646753762,Bitcoin Mixers: How Do They Work and Why Are They Used?,"The Bitcoin blockchain is entirely public. Head to a blockchain explorer and you can find a watertight record of all the bitcoin transactions ever processed since the cryptocurrency's launch in early 2009.  For some, that is a core feature, not a problem. But for those who need a little more anonymity, the public nature of the Bitcoin blockchain is a huge privacy flaw.  There are ways of keeping bitcoin transactions entirely private – to obscure who sends what to whom. One of the most popular methods is to use a bitcoin mixer, also known as a tumbler. These are tools that jumble up an amount of bitcoin in private pools before spitting them out to their intended recipients.  The idea is that, by shuffling bitcoin through a black box, it’s difficult to work out that person A sent 10 bitcoins to person B. All a public explorer will show is that person A sent some bitcoin to a mixer, as did a dozen other people, and that person B received some bitcoin from a mixer, as did a dozen other people.  Centralized vs. decentralized mixers  There are two main types of bitcoin mixers:  Centralized mixers: like Blender.io.  Decentralized mixers: such as Wasabi and JoinMarket.  Centralized mixers are companies that will accept your bitcoin and send back different bitcoins for a fee. While they offer an easy solution for tumbling bitcoin, they also still present a privacy challenge, as while the links between “incoming” and “outgoing” bitcoin will not be public, the mixer itself will still have a record that connects the transactions. Meaning that in the future the company could give up those records and reveal a users' connection to the coins.  Decentralized mixers employ protocols such as CoinJoin to fully obscure transactions via either a coordinated or peer-to-peer method. Basically, the protocol allows a large group of users to join together an amount of bitcoin (i.e. 100 people want to mix 1 bitcoin each) and then redistribute it so everyone gets 1 bitcoin back, but no one can tell who got what or where it came from.  Problems with using mixers  Mixers are not without their flaws. It’s unlikely that someone else in the mixer sent the exact amount of bitcoin as you, minus the tumbler’s fee. If a law enforcement agency knows the address used by its first suspect, and if the second suspect is the only one to have received a little less of a specific amount, it’s not going to be too hard to reconnect the flow of money. This problem becomes harder to solve the more people use the mixer.  Some exchanges don’t allow mixed bitcoin to enter or leave exchanges. Since exchanges can identify mixers, they label mixed bitcoin ‘tainted."" Binance, for instance, has blocked withdrawals to Wasabi, a privacy-preserving bitcoin wallet that integrates a popular mixing service called CoinJoin. Other popular bitcoin mixers include Samourai and JoinMarket.  It’s important to note that not all mixing services are legitimate, and some are far less effective at obscuring financial transactions than others. Be sure to do your research before using a mixer.  Are bitcoin mixers illegal?  The ability to obfuscate bitcoin transactions makes mixers an obvious hotbed for money laundering, attracting the likes of tax dodgers and criminals interested in hiding the proceeds of illegal activity.  The question of whether using these services is illegal depends on which jurisdiction you are based in. In February 2021, then-U.S. Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski said that using mixers to hide crypto transactions “is a crime.”  Two months later, U.S. authorities arrested Roman Sterlingov, aka the Russian-Swedish founder of bitcoin tumbling service “Bitcoin Fog,” for helping people launder $335 million. In August 2021, Larry Harmon, the owner of a bitcoin mixer called Helix, pleaded guilty to helping darknet market criminals launder around $300 million.  New anti-money laundering rules, like the Financial Action Task Force’s “travel rule” and the European Union’s AMLD-5 directive, will make laundering money tougher, and could make bitcoin tumblers less viable for people who want to join in the wider crypto economy – the sort that relies on popular exchanges accepting your coins.  Read More: What are privacy coins and are they legal?  Alternatives to bitcoin mixers  A bitcoin mixer isn’t the only way to hide the flow of bitcoin transactions.  After hacks, criminals often siphon funds through lots of exchanges using accounts created with cheaply bought or stolen identities. This method, known as chain-hopping, relies on the fact it takes law enforcement a long time to force exchanges to shut down accounts; plus, it’s tricky for exchanges to spot dodgy accounts in the first place if they have already passed through know-your-customer (KYC) procedures.  Privacy advocates maintain that methods like privacy coins are a powerful way to prevent the government from snooping on your financial transactions, asserting they are not just for criminals. To obscure the flow of funds, Monero uses one-time use ""stealth"" addresses and mixes genuine transaction signatures with decoys. While one of the first major dark web marketplaces, the Silk Road, had a bitcoin tumbler baked into its infrastructure, former darknet market White House Market, known for its security, only accepted Monero.  Alternatively, Zcash offers optional private transactions that rely on zero-knowledge proofs, which don’t share transaction information.

Specifically, the effort looks to foster smart-contract blockchain Avalanche’s “subnet” functionality, where application-specific blockchains – be they for Web 3 gaming or decentralized finance (DeFi) – can be spun up at scale.  Early targets of the so-called “Multiverse” initiative include DeFi Kingdoms, a popular game that ported over to Avalanche in December. The effort will create a new Avalanche-native token, CRYSTAL, meant to complement the game’s existing JEWEL token, according to Tuesday’s press release.  Other members of the project’s first cohort include Aave, Golden Tree Asset Management, Wintermute, Jump Crypto, Valkyrie and Securitize.  The new injection of funding speaks to the continued race among newer base layers competing for the smart-contract mindshare that Ethereum has long commanded.  Identity and compliance measures baked into certain subnets could be a boon for institutional DeFi, Aave founder Stani Kulechov said in a statement.  “This is a significant leap toward a future where the barriers between traditional and decentralized finance cease to exist,” he said.  From a technical perspective, projects utilizing their own “subnet” blockchains will eliminate competition for pooled resources, which has become an issue on Ethereum for events like popular non-fungible token (NFT) drops.

Polymesh chief Graeme Moore said the platform’s GitHub will contain a list of requests for proposals, but developers can submit their own ideas, too. The Polymesh grant program will foster developer firepower for things like a tokenized exchange, cross-chain settlement engine, wallet integrations and a finance-oriented block explorer.  Budding blockchains face a chicken-and-egg problem when it comes to getting an ecosystem of developers building on a new platform. Offering grants and incentive programs has been a successful strategy for layer 1, or base, blockchains like Avalanche, for instance, which announced a $180 million program last summer.  “People want to build infrastructure on Polymesh because it’s a blockchain built for regulated assets, but the amount of use cases and the amount of users is still admittedly in its early days,” said Moore in an interview. “So how do you solve that? You bootstrap it by incentivizing developers to build applications on the blockchain.”  Read more: Polymath to Launch Blockchain Built for Tokenized Stocks  The tokenized security space is now moving forward at pace, with banks and the like, whose interest was piqued back in 2017, now seeing hardened technology emerging with sufficient regulatory guardrails in place.

42417137,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcSK3Yr,1646751157,Virtual Beers and Digital Orgasms: Welcome to the Age of Metaverse Commerce,"Guess what holiday falls on July 31? That would be National Orgasm Day. That was the hook for NARS, the French cosmetics brand, to unveil NFTs of its most iconic product line – lipstick and blush called “Orgasm.”  Last summer, NARS partnered with three female artists (DJ Nina Kravis, Azede Jean-Pierre, and Sara Shakeel) to create a suite of non-fungible tokens. “These works were inspired by Orgasm,” explains Dina Fierro, NARS’ vice president of Global Digital Strategy. “It was inspired by the concept, the biological response, and certainly inspired by the product in its sensorial nature.”  The NFTs were called “Take Me,” “Consume Me” and “Captivate Me.” In one, a woman’s lips are opened to reveal a tidal wave. In another, a peach-colored liquid (the color of the Orgasm products) moves back and forth, rhythmically, seductively. As NARS wrote on its Instagram post, “There’s an orgasm for everyone.”  The success of these NFTs emboldened NARS to take another swing into the metaverse, dropping seven custom designs into Animal Crossing, Nintendo’s open-ended virtual world. Fierro says that when it comes to new tech, traditionally, beauty and fashion brands were always the “laggard in the conversation,” slow to embrace e-commerce and social media. But not with the metaverse.  “What I’m observing around the industry,” says Fierro, “is that people are determined not to be left behind.”  That now seems true of the entire economy, and the list of “companies entering the metaverse” feels longer than “companies that haven’t entered the metaverse.” (The “metaverse is that impossible-to-define concept of a vast digital world, which can mean a blockchain-based environment like Decentraland or even Augmented Reality in Walmart.)  Read More: A Crypto Guide to the Metaverse  Just a few examples: Sotheby’s (BID) opened a gallery in Decentraland. Adidas partnered with The Bored Ape Yacht Club to launch “Into the Metaverse” NFTs. Gucci created an art installation in Roblox (the virtual world filled with user-generated games, played by 50% of kids under the age of 16.) Coca-Cola (KO) designed “Friendship NFTs” that are “reimagined for the metaverse.” 19 Crimes, the wine label, used augmented reality so that when you scan the bottle you can see the “criminals” telling you a story. Balenciaga brought haute couture into Fortnite. Even SPACs are entering the metaverse. And on and on.  But something shifted in the past few months.  “Last year, a lot of [companies] were doing these things for the PR pop, and the earlier you were, the more PR pop you would get,” says Cathy Hackl, a marketing consultant who specializes in the metaverse. “Now the novelty is gone. You might get PR pop, but it’s a more muted effect. Companies are really focusing on the long term.” Companies are no longer just dabbling in the metaverse, says Hackl, but they’re “taking a look at the most holistic metaverse strategies.”  Nike (NKE), for example, filed a flurry of metaverse-related trademark applications. The sneaker manufacturer also posted metaverse-y job openings like a Virtual Material Designer, launched a Digital Product Creation group, and acquired RTFKT (a crypto wearable studio). When Microsoft (MSFT) announced it would fork over $70 billion to buy a video game company, it said the reason was the metaverse. Facebook is now known for two things: going Meta (FB) and a tanking stock price. In Apple’s (AAPL) January earnings call, Tim Cook said the metaverse is “very interesting to us,” noting that Apple has over 14,000 Augmented Reality kit apps in the App Store, so “we see a lot of potential in this space and are investing accordingly.”  But what is this “potential,” exactly? Just what, exactly, are mainstream companies hoping to get out of this? The obvious answer is “money,” as Grayscale estimates a $1 trillion market opportunity in the metaverse. (Grayscale is a unit of Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk; DCG is also a significant investor in Decentraland tokens.) But how, specifically? Hackl ticks off the typical reasons: Publicity, customer acquisition, customer engagement, customer retention, and – perhaps the juiciest prize – new streams of revenue.  Digital clothes. Digital bicycles. A digital renovation of the upstairs bathroom in your Decentraland home. Sound bonkers? So did the idea of spending $2.9 million on a digital ape, but here we are. “We’re now entering this era where we’re placing equal value on digital ownership as we do on physical ownership,” said Michael Toner, chief marketing officer of Threedium, a firm that helps onboard companies into the metaverse.  This world of Digital Ownership is not that different from our current reality, said Toner.  “Today, people are accustomed to buying digital assets and buying digital books. That’s not a weird concept to people,” he said. It doesn’t take a giant leap, Toner said, to extend that concept to digital “watches, knickknacks, decorations, and paintings.”  More and more of his clients want to create “digital twins” of real-world objects, he said. In the upcoming Metaverse Fashion Week, for example, you can buy actual clothes from Hugo Boss directly from the pixels of Decentraland. As Toner sees it, “We’re entering the age of meta-commerce.”  Marketing in the metaverse  If a digital orgasm is a tough sell, digital beer seems just as tricky. But in 2020, Lindsey McInerney, then the head of global innovation at AB InBev (BUD) – the company that owns Budweiser, Corona, Beck’s and seemingly every other non-micro, Joe Sixpack beer – had a hunch that it just might work.  Read More: How to Invest in the Metaverse  Lindsey McInerney isn’t your typical marketing executive. She wrote a thesis on the 1970s skateboard scene, she studied the birth of hacktivism and she cared more about culture than corporations. Then reality struck, and she grudgingly realized that her degree in “cultural studies” had no practical utility. So she pivoted to PR and “almost got kicked out of PR school” because her press releases included links to a new and unproven website called YouTube. At the time that was forbidden; now it’s standard practice.  McInerney has always been contrarian, and while becoming an expert in Web 2 social media (heading up innovation at Hootsuite, the social media dashboard service), she kept her eyes on virtual reality and blockchain. When she was hired by AB InBev, you would think she would focus on beer and hops and barley. Nope. McInerney surprised her colleagues by writing a thesis on Web 3 and the metaverse, as she considered it a “seismic shift” that the company needed to understand.  “This is seismic,” says McInerney, repeating it for emphasis. “This is way bigger than social media was. It’s as big as e-commerce, if not bigger.” She says that “the convergence of the metaverse and Web 3 is happening at a clip I have never felt. Nothing has ever been this quick.”  As a pilot program, McInerney convinced senior leadership to green-light a partnership with Zed Run, a crypto horse racing game. (Think: a virtual Kentucky Derby.) McInerney had confidence that the branding of Stella Artois, the company’s premium pilsner, neatly fit the high-end world of Zed Run, which she describes as “the most prestigious game in the metaverse.” AB InBev dropped custom Stella Artois skins (items that customize game characters' looks). It auctioned virtual horses. It launched a new three-dimensional race track. The partnership paid homage to AB InBev’s multi-year “The Life Artois” campaign, and for the first time, mainstream beer entered the metaverse.  The pilot test exploded. McInerney says the brand scored over 100 million media impressions in the first week, garnering press from Forbes and AdWeek. She views this as just a tiny glimpse of what will come. “This is not just about e-commerce,” says McInerney. “This is not just about the future of your ability to sell on the internet. It’s the future of all of the buckets.”  Another “bucket”: Customer rewards programs. It’s Marketing 101 that customers in membership programs – such as frequent flier accounts – are more loyal and lucrative. There’s just one catch.  Read More: JPMorgan Is the First Bank Into the Metaverse, Looks at Business Opportunities  “We all know how terrible membership programs are,” says Kevin Wright, the manager of global brand communications at Adidas, which has leaned heavily into the metaverse. “Oh man, they’re awful. They are so bad. They’re cumbersome. The rewards [can be] irrelevant. They expire.” Wright clarifies that it’s early and “we’re nowhere near figuring this out,” but a token-based membership program, potentially, could offer a better customer experience – such as being programmable and wired to do certain things, or easier to convert and swap. Other Web 3 experts agree, such as Jeremiah Owyang, who recently gave me this prediction: “Brands will convert their loyalty program points into social tokens.”  Then Wright suggests a sneakier upside to the metaverse: an accounting play. When companies offer rewards programs, says Wright, those points create an “enormous financial liability for brands.” Just as banks need to have ample cash on hand, companies need to reflect the risk that the rewards points customers have accumulated – all those frequent flier miles – could be cashed out in a sudden orgy of redemption.  “It never happens, but if everyone wanted to [redeem] their Starbucks [SBUX] free drink on the same day, Starbucks is in trouble,” says Wright. This is why the “accounting becomes a nightmare.” A token-based membership program in the metaverse, says Wright, would solve this financial headache. (The exact mechanics are still TBD, but this squares with a Deloitte report noting that “unclaimed rewards are accounted for as liabilities on a company’s balance sheet,” and suggests blockchain-based tokens as an alternative.) “We spend so much time talking metaverse with product designers, but I want to talk metaverse with our accountants,” says Wright, laughing.  There are other non-obvious applications. Janet Balis, a consultant at EY (formerly Ernst & Young) who focuses on the metaverse, says that while most of the initial use cases have targeted “B-to-C” (Business to Consumer), she predicts we’ll see forays into B-to-B (Business to Business). Think of how many trade shows became virtual during Covid. Think of all the Zoom meetings. Many of those events will return to in-person, but perhaps not all.  “I do think there’s an opportunity for some events to either be enhanced by the metaverse, or to be replaced by an experience in the metaverse, in a B-to-B context,” says Balis. (One company that’s tried the enhancement route: CoinDesk, which, during peak Covid, streamed one of its virtual events into Decentraland’s convention center.)  Then there are the internal possibilities. “It’s an opportunity to onboard employees in a more creative setting, even as people work from home,” says Balis. In a piece she wrote for The Harvard Business Review (another signal of mainstream acceptance), Balis notes that the metaverse could be used to train future surgeons, that Microsoft’s “mesh” platform injects avatars in metaverse-esque collaboration spaces, and that chip manufacturer “Nvidia believes that investing in metaverse simulations of such things as manufacturing and logistics will reduce waste and accelerate better business solutions.” And now Boeing (BA) is designing planes in the metaverse.  Curious to see just how far the metaverse extends outside the crypto bubble, I reached out to a traditional consulting firm, Want Branding, that has nothing to do with blockchain – its clients range from Gillette to MGM Resorts (MGM). “We work at a high level [with] companies all across the different verticals, and everyone is thinking about it,” says John Downey, the firm’s chief marketing officer. “More and more clients have asked us, what does it mean from a brand perspective to move into the metaverse?”  EY found the same thing. “I think for consumer-facing companies, the vast majority would likely have a marketing or customer experience executive with the metaverse on their mind,” says Balis. EY even has a metaverse-centric department, and recently wrote a blog post entitled “CEOs, it is time to enter the metaverse.” EY’s competitor, Deloitte, launched a metaverse shop of its own, announcing an “Unlimited Reality” studio to “help educate, inspire, accelerate and execute on client goals for the metaverse.”  Money-grubbing and the metaverse  “Just because you can do it, doesn’t mean you should,” says McInerney. “There is absolutely no inherent value in your logo. Despite how much you love it, no one cares.” She wanted to ensure that AB InBev avoided anything that looked like a money grab, such as launching 10,000 NFTs and hoping for magic revenue. She gets the temptation. Marketing promotions, by design, are almost always a money sink. They’re hard costs with fuzzy benefits. This is why McInerney says that many marketers are now thinking, “Holy s**t! We can not be a cost center! This is great!”  Just one problem. If it looks clunky or greedy, as McInerney says, “No one’s going to buy your stuff again.”  The concern over not being money-grabby was shared by Clinique, one of the first beauty brands to get meta-curious. Instead of selling NFTs, Clinique asked consumers to share uplifting stories of optimism on Instagram. (It called the campaign “MetaOptimist.”) Clinique gave away NFTs and 10 years of products to the winners, such as a mom who was sick and started each day with “hope and optimism” that her son was getting stronger and wiser. The goal was to “modernize loyalty and drive engagement with the brand,” says Roxanne Iyer, Clinique’s VP of global consumer engagement, who was happy to see a 20% spike in search and brand awareness.  Not every campaign was as successful. Every marketing executive dreads the reaction to Pepsi’s (PEP) NFT launch. When Pepsi’s twitter handle announced its NFTs, soon Meta (Facebook) replied, “This is going to look great in the metaverse,” to which Pepsi replied, “You know it, fren!” As one branding expert said, “It seemed inauthentic. Web 3 reacted to that, and it’s just Cringe.”  Other companies simply need more data. “I would characterize it less as risks and concerns, and more about unanswered questions,” says Balis. What are the legal considerations? How will taxes be handled? What’s happening with regulation? These are the kind of questions that Adidas has had to tackle, which is tricky for a global brand.  “We’ve got over 60,000 employees,” says Wright. “It’s such a large group with so many brand representatives.” The internal operations of Adidas’ European football division, say, might work differently than the soccer teams in the U.S.  Or consider the finances. In Europe the company uses the euro, in the United States, the dollar, and then gas fees need to be paid in tokens. “It becomes rather complicated, certainly on this scale and across so many countries,” says Wright. “The logistics of it has been a feat.”  Fierro had to sort through all of these challenges when NARS released the orgasm NFTs. “They each require a very in-depth production process that is incredibly time intensive,” says Fierro. “Frankly, this requires a level of budget and investment that a lot of brands don’t have allocated at the moment.”  Then there’s the fact that the metaverse is still figuring out what it is.  “The reason why we’re not seeing a full spectrum of companies exploring all of the different use cases is a scale issue,” says Balis. By “scale,” she means that it’s not yet fully functional. And it’s splintered. A 3D image that works in Roblox might be a disaster in The Sandbox. (That’s a mobile game, not a literal sandbox).  “Some of the metaverse is only accessible through virtual reality headsets. Some of the metaverse is only accessible through desktop computers,” says Balis. Some of it is only mobile, some is centralized, some is decentralized. All of it takes time to understand.  For Wright at Adidas, the biggest challenge remains the overall skepticism about crypto, and a longstanding aversion to much of what it connotes – scams, speculation, rug pulls. In terms of getting corporate buy-in, says Wright, “For every story of someone getting swindled on OpenSea, we lose 10 to 15 more people.”  In a sense, none of this is that different from how branding experts usually think about brands.  “I don’t think that the branding or advertising questions about the metaverse are different from any other space,” says Balis. “Is my customer here? Is this an environment where I feel I can create a quality experience?”  Other questions: Can I bring my brand to life in a way that’s authentic? Can I tell my story in a way that fits our values? As Balis says, “Some of the creative formats are going to be new, but I don’t think these questions are any different.”  AB InBev’s strange brew  At AB InBev, McInerney resoundingly answered these questions, and then she determined that, yes, it does make sense to bring a beer into the metaverse. Which finally brings us back to the core question – what does it even mean to “drink a beer in the metaverse,” and how is this not absurd? At happy hour, I prefer my IPAs on draft, or maybe in a bottle, or sometimes in a can. Rarely as a JPEG.  I share my befuddlement with McInerney, and she gives a compelling counterargument.  “I can’t drink and drive, but you see billboards on the highways all the time, advertising alcohol,” she says. Or she’ll get served ads for beer at noon on a Tuesday, “and I’m working, not drinking.”  Her point is that, yes, a Virtual Beer might not rival the cold frosty beverage that you actually drink, but perhaps it’s a better “impression” than you get from traditional advertising.  “We can do so much better than billboards on a highway, or than beer tweets at noon on a Tuesday,” says McInerney, who has left AB InBev and is now starting her own Web 3 and metaverse-focused firm. “We can really surprise and delight people who want to play with the brands.”  And in the future, maybe the beer could actually be consumed. McInerney suggests a hybrid digital-physical experience, perhaps while watching a horse race.  “My vision is that you and I would be able to each race our horses in two separate places.” She’d be in London, I’d be in Denver. “And we’d be able to log onto Zed Run. And we’d be able to pick a couple of races to enter.” We share that digital experience. We might also, virtually, go to the Zed Run bar in Decentraland.  “I would buy the first round, because that’s only right,” says McInerney. And then in 20 minutes, an actual real-life beer shows up at my doorstep in Denver, via Uber Eats, and an actual beer shows up at McInerney’s home in London. “We can have a shared ‘digi-physical experience’ where we’re racing our horses while enjoying a Stella beer.”  Some might see that future as exciting. Some will see it as dystopian. But more and more companies see it as something else altogether: Profitable.  Further reading on the metaverse  Ethereum in 2022: What Is Money in the Metaverse?

42421645,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXotPp,1646750700,GameFi’s Promise and Reality Are Still Worlds Apart,"Among crypto’s hottest trends is GameFi, which brings Web 3’s advantages to gaming. Web 3’s meaning varies by individual but reflects rising demand among people who are spending more time and money in meta worlds to own their virtual assets, free from the interference of platform developers.  But are strong in-game property rights compatible with fun, escapist experiences that users are seeking?  Skeptics are not convinced. They say that GameFi games are not fun but rather merely repackaged versions of the worst elements of decentralized finance (DeFi). Play-to-earn games, some skeptics say, suffer because they are more or less pyramid schemes.  Let's set that issue aside for a moment and acknowledge that fun is subjective. Let’s also assume that just because fun Web 3 games have not arisen so far doesn't mean they won't arise in the future. But let's also point out that a major problem with the Web 3 vision for gaming is that developers believe that closed, non-interoperable environments provide users with a good experience.  GameFi's promise  The bull case for GameFi hinges on the power of self-custody, open source platforms and composability – the ability of different components to work together efficiently. GameFi promises game players the ability to shape gaming ecosystems. Assets should be interoperable between worlds and inalienable. What does that mean?  For Web 3 proponents, users are passive spectators in the Web 2 world. In gaming, greedy and autocratic developers treat them as cash cows. Web 3’s goal is for players to actively influence game dynamics. GameFi’s vision is that whatever users imagine, should be possible.  Think of user generated levels, user generated items, vast customized quests and challenges, or “better” alternate endings to stories. Games evolve organically, no longer constrained by the rigid vision of a single game developing company. In a world where Web 3 wins, fans don’t have to wait over a decade for the new game Half-Life 3, but can engage infinitely in the Half-Life universe, defeating the Combine over and over again across infinite different scenarios.  Building complex games  Part of the reason why building complex games is hard is that like all complex systems, it is not entirely clear how different parts can interact with each other. Moreover, when you have hundreds of motivated individuals exploring how they can get ahead in a game, some will find elements or combinations of elements that game creators hadn’t considered. These can potentially ruin the experience for everyone else.  A good example of this is the locked jewel saga of Defi Kingdoms. Defi Kingdoms is among the most popular GameFi games, with approximately 150,000 monthly active users. Defi Kingdoms developers had originally stipulated that users would earn jewel tokens by “planting seeds” (i.e., providing liquidity in automated market makers). The majority of the earned jewels would be locked however, with linear vesting at some point in the future. These locked jewels could also be “unlocked” using miners, which are in-game non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  What they hadn’t realized, is that the GovernanceToken contract they forked for the vesting schedule contained an emergency function that allows a user to transfer all jewel, both locked and unlocked. The original intent of this function was to save a user in case of a compromised wallet, but it was then used to create all sorts of secondary markets for locked jewel.  The first market created for locked jewel was a discord server with a trusted third party named Sarah serving as an escrow. This market has since disappeared, with accusations being thrown around on Twitter that Sarah was a man and had stolen money from several market participants.  Permissionless markets then sprang up, such as dfk.market, where people could buy and sell their locked jewel via smart contracts. The most advanced iterations, including the Greedy Merchant Guild, allow users to create a locked jewel “stash” which is then exchanged for gmjewel, a standard ERC20 token that represents a locked jewel. This final step makes the supposedly locked jewel tokens completely fungible and tradable.  GameFi proponents will say that this scenario is evidence of lively communities, and that building these communities is only possible due to Web 3’s interoperability. While this point is true, it overlooks that game developers never intended for users to be able to trade their locked jewel tokens.  This “hack” is not just an issue for the developers. Many other players have grumbled on Twitter that this has ruined the experience for them (as an aside, by this they mean that they think the price of jewel has declined). Finally, the game developers have taken notice of the market, and have now started moves with the intent to kill this secondary market. So much for permissionless and composable.  Building complex systems, like massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), is incredibly complicated. Making them interoperable, permissionless and composable is even more so. In financial systems decentralization, interoperability and self-custody are powerful benefits that reduce counterparty and censorship risk, and increase capital efficiencies. These things come at a cost: Blockchains are slow and clunky.  This additional complexity may be warranted if you are investing considerable amounts of time building a virtual reality that you call home. But is it warranted for people who simply want to have fun playing a game? If you are seeking escapism, would you want to escape to a virtual world with strong property rights, where metaverse oligarchs are significantly wealthier than you ?",NEUTRAL,없음,MARKET | TRADING,Boaz Sobrado,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/03/08/gamefis-promise-and-reality-are-still-worlds-apart,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c1d3a66bbf78f29ecdabdf3aeaa67b2695c68985-612x408.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Starting April 1, trades of digital assets on government-approved exchanges will be exempt from a 7% value-added-tax (VAT), said the minister, Arkhom Termpittayapaisith, according to the meeting minutes posted on the government's website. Transfers involving Thailand's retail central bank digital currency will also be exempt from the VAT over the same time period, he said.  Traders will also be able to deduct losses from crypto trading from taxes due on gains, the minister said.  A draft decree of the new tax exemptions has been proposed under Thailand's Revenue Code, said Ekniti Nitithanpraphas, general director of the finance ministry's revenue department, according to the meeting minutes. The draft aims to increase the competitiveness of the industry and develop payment system infrastructure that is ready for the digital economy, he said.

Huobi Promotes Crypto Awareness on Women&apos;s Day Today, Huobi Global launched a special Primebox promotion that is designed to increase female engagement across the blockchain and crypto space. When the digital space was created, a survey showed that women weren&apos;t digitally invested as men were. However, this year&apos;s survey shows that 24 percent of women in America own cryptocurrency and 75 percent engage in spot trading. Although the numbers have been low, the progress to date has been enormous. Huobi&apos;s Primebox Activity The Primebox promotion is an activity that includes 5 cards representing famous women. The activity ends with the female user collecting all the 5 Primebox cards. The top 10 female users will then be selected and invited to created and mint NFT with their digital avatars. Huobi plans to list the NFT collection on OpenSea.

The raise is the latest bet by investors on the future of fashion in the metaverse, a growing industry that includes avatar companies, high-priced virtual wearables and even legacy name brands like Nike (NKE) and Adidas.  The Polygon-based UNXD calls itself a “business-to-business-to-customer” platform, collaborating with established brands while also creating its own non-fungible token (NFT) collections and marketplace, co-founder Shashi Menon told CoinDesk.

42375159,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw68rb,1646748000,Bitcoin Mining Startup Blockmetrix Raises $43M in Series B Round,"Dallas-based bitcoin (BTC) mining startup Blockmetrix announced a $43 million Series B funding round, bringing total funding to $50 million since June 2021.  The new monies will allow Blockmetrix to secure more than 5,000 mining rigs to be added to 1,000 miners put to work with last year’s $7 million Series A. This latest round was oversubscribed, said the company, and included investors from the U.S., Australia and several Asian countries.  Blockmetrix plans to grow rapidly by using the maximum amount of available capital and debt to buy mining rigs, while controlling power costs through various joint ventures, CEO and co-founder Nevin Bannister told CoinDesk. “Through [joint ventures] we will obtain part-ownership of a co-location facility to ensure low power rates and a place to house our bitcoin miners,” he said.  The company’s JV partners will be responsible for the development and operation of the co-location facility, which will help channel the majority of the funding directly towards increasing hashrates rather than building infrastructure, Bannister explained.  Bannister is a professional entrepreneur, having previously founded startups that have sold for a combined value of over $800 million, according to the Blockmetrix website.  The funding comes at a time when cryptocurrency and broader markets have pulled back from their peaks last year, dampening some of the euphoria among investors. “Our investors were attracted to our management's proven ability to operate and scale at a high level,” said Bannister. “Our ability to raise a significant amount of funding during market turmoil and geopolitical challenges makes us distinct from our competitors,” he added, noting the company’s investors consisted mostly of high-net-worth individuals, many of whom have institutional ties and experience.  Another plus is Blockmetrix’s U.S focus, Texas in particular. “Experts have declared Texas to be the next Bitcoin mining capital,” Bannister said. “Local legislation encourages continued investment in digital asset mining operations in the state with the hopes of revitalizing economic growth and bringing jobs to the area.”  Blockmetrix is currently negotiating a JV deal that will secure a 100 megawatt (MW) co-location facility in Texas, with expansion potential to 200MW, Bannister told CoinDesk.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/08/bitcoin-mining-startup-blockmetrix-raises-43m-in-series-b-round,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/38f2f062ac9aba04590db63ba13292916e573211-1600x1091.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The project looks to leverage “cryptoeconomic games to curate the world’s information,” according to the KurateDAO white paper.  “Paying people is an inherent part of what we’re doing, so crypto is a natural choice for that,” CEO Michael Fischer told CoinDesk in an interview.  In the current model of internet databases, there is one moderator who decides what information gets to be published to the database. KurateDAO’s technology provides an infrastructure for content curation, with the process being divvied up into three roles: curators, scouts and viewers. Together, the three roles decide what information is added to the database, Fischer said.  Each of the datasets operates as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governed by the KurateDAO’s native token.  Fischer said KurateDAO seeks to work alongside emerging Web 3 applications and other crowdsourced online information hubs, such as music curation and job board sites.  It currently operates on Ethereum but plans to use the $6.85 million funding round to hire developers to build out multi-chain solutions.

Sign up here to get it in your inbox each weekday morning.  Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Bitcoin steady as commodity markets see heightened volatility.  Featured stories: Record GBTC discount draws institutional demand, analytics firm said. Tightening financial conditions cast a shadow on the March Fed rate hike.  And check out the CoinDesk TV show “First Mover,” hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern time. Today’s show will feature guests:  Alex Bornyakov, deputy minister, Ukraine Ministry of Digital Transformation  Darrell Duffie, senior fellow, Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research  Lisa Mayer, founder and CEO, Boss Beauties  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  Bitcoin (BTC) ticked higher as European stocks rose and S&P 500 futures erased early losses after reports hit the wires that the European Union is mulling a large joint-bond sale to fund energy and defense expenditure.  The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war injected volatility into the global commodity market. The London Metal Exchange suspended nickel trading after prices surged more than 100% to over $100,000 per metric ton in Asian trading. The move was likely a result of massive short covering by traders holding bearish positions in the commodity.  Bitcoin appears uncorrelated to commodities and is more sensitive to high-beta and tech stocks, as discussed in Monday's First Mover.  That said, a full-blown commodity crisis can put pressure on stock markets and cryptocurrencies. ""Investors who own crypto assets and ascribe value to say the scarcity of bitcoin may also be invested in other assets like stocks, and when there is newsflow that challenges the price action in a significant way, behavioral bias may lead to broad-based selling,"" Coinbase Institutional said in a weekly market commentary shared with CoinDesk via email.  According to Credit Suisse's Zoltan Pozsar, a commodity crisis is unfolding. ""Russian commodities today are like subprime CDOs [collateralized debt obligations] were in 2008. Conversely, non-Russian commodities are like U.S. Treasury securities were back in 2008. One collapsing in price, and the other one surging in price, with margin calls on both regardless of which side you are on,"" Pozsar said in a note titled ""Bretton Woods III"" published Monday.  ""After this war is over, 'money' will never be the same again ... and bitcoin (if it still exists then) will probably benefit from all this,"" Pozsar added.

Security and Exchange Commission filings ""show institutions building directional exposure by buying Grayscale shares at a 30% discount,"" blockchain analytics firm Glassnode's founders said in the weekly newsletter published on March 4.  According to Vetle Lunde, market analyst at Arcane Research, several factors argue in favor of buying GBTC at the moment.  ""The announced DCG buyback program of Grayscale trust shares could contribute to narrowing the discounts,"" Lunde told CoinDesk in a Twitter chat, referring to Digital Currency Group, parent company of both Grayscale and CoinDesk. ""However, the big bet that would cause this bet to be particularly profitable is the outcome of GBTC's ETF filing. An approval would lead the shares to trade at net asset value (NAV) due to active redemptions.""  Grayscale applied to convert the world's biggest bitcoin fund into a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF last year. Analysts don't expect the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve the conversion anytime soon.  Shares in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, the world's largest digital asset manager, began trading at a discount relative to the underlying cryptocurrency held in the fund last February. On Monday, the discount stood just short of the record 29.87% registered on Jan. 25, according to data provided by derivatives research firm Skew.  Grayscale was the preferred venue for institutional investors to gain exposure to bitcoin without owning the cryptocurrency until shares traded at a premium to the NAV. Read how the trust works here.  Tightening Financial Conditions Cast Shadow on March Fed Rate Hike  Risk assets, including bitcoin, have faced selling pressure well before Russia invaded Ukraine, thanks to fears of faster liquidity withdrawal of stimulus by the Federal Reserve.  And while these fears still linger, some observers are beginning to call a delay in the first Fed rate hike from March to May or June.  ""IMHO, given the rapid tightening in the credit markets, extreme geopolitical tensions, dollar strength and flattening of the curve, the Fed should stay pat at March FOMC and punt the liftoff to May meeting when there is more visibility as to whether the current context is transient,"" macro fund manager Igor Schatz tweeted.  Goldman Sachs' global financial index has risen 60 basis points to 100.2 since Russia invaded Ukraine, signaling a rough period ahead for the worldwide economy.  In 2013, the Fed delayed the planned phased unwinding of asset purchasing program from September, citing tightening of financial conditions observed in the run-up to the September meeting as one of the key reasons to delay the taper.  At press time, the Fed funds futures show traders expects the Fed to kick-off the tightening cycle with a 25 basis point rate hike next week.

Proceeds from the collection will be donated to Red Cross Ukraine and UNICEF. The collection, titled “Vandalz for Ukraine: WhIsBe x Wladimir Klitschko,” was made in partnership with artist WhIsBe, and will be available to mint in a tiered pricing model for $100, $1,000 and $10,000.  “It is a magnificent initiative, a support through art at the service of people who suffer,” Klitschko said in a statement. “Art can be beautiful on many levels when used to serve humanity.”  Klitschko and his brother Vitali, who is the current mayor of Kiev and also a former champion boxer, have become faces of the country’s military resistance, having both chosen to fight on the front lines despite their celebrity status.  The collection is one of numerous NFT-related projects to be released in support of Ukraine in recent weeks.  An NFT of the Ukrainian flag sold for $6.75 million on March 2, and the total contributions made to Ukraine via cryptocurrency during the war have now surpassed $50 million.  “I’m grateful for the opportunity to be of service for the greater good,” WhIsBe said in a statement. “It’s incredible to be able to use my art and this emerging technology to help others in need and provide immediate relief to any location in the world.”",POSITIVE,없음,TECHNOLOGY,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/08/ukrainian-boxer-wladimir-klitschko-releases-nft-collection-to-support-relief-effort,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/83558c9ba827591638508b6a2e6671c228faa789-8192x5464.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bain Capital Crypto is “oriented around early-stage investing all the way through liquid tokens,” Bain Capital Ventures (BCV) partner Stefan Cohen told CoinDesk in an interview.  It’s the latest traditional finance firm to go whole-hog into the nearly $2 trillion cryptocurrency sector, following Sequoia and others that have made their intentions clear in recent months.  So far, the Bain fund has deployed just under $100 million in capital across about a dozen portfolio companies. The investments were largely in early-stage, pre-launch protocol projects, said Cohen.  “We’re at the very early innings of a multi-decade technology shift by which the internet is going to be re-architected on open, community-owned public standards,” Cohen told CoinDesk. “In order to properly invest against that macro trend, we really need a dedicated investment platform that’s designed around the needs of the founders and the ecosystem.”  Investment areas  Cohen and BCV partner Alex Evans are co-leading the fund, which now has seven members split nearly evenly between researchers and investors.  Bain Capital Crypto is broadly interested in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web 3 categories, but the fund has a narrower focus on protocols and the native tokens that power them.  “The number one priority is investing in the infrastructure,” said Cohen. “That would be layer 1 scaling solutions, privacy products, middleware, storage solutions and the sort of components used to build the ultimate internet services we think we’ll be interacting with in the future.”  Governance goals  Crypto requires a new kind of investment team that also has the capability to actively participate in protocol governance, said Evans.  “You should look for us to build our resume on-chain. We want to use and participate in the protocols and companies we are involved in,” said Evans.

The London Metal Exchange suspended trading in nickel after a purported short squeeze drove prices of the metal to a record $101,000 in early Asian hours.  “Those that had bet against the metal’s rise in value have now been forced to buy at a much higher price, creating a short squeeze,” explained Susannah Streeter, an investment analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, in an email to CoinDesk. “It’s likely a big margin call prompted the suspension of trading, with sharp gains forcing speculators to scramble for additional capital to put into accounts to cover the shortfall.”  Nickel is a key component in electric vehicle batteries, a sector that has grown alongside cryptocurrencies in the past few years.  Tuesday’s gains in crypto added 1.1% to the total market capitalization. The Bitcoin Dominance Index rose to 42.4%.

Dubbed the “WoW Foundation,” the initiative will receive $25 million in funding over five years, with the money going towards education and mentorship.  Digital illustrator and non-fungible token (NFT) artist Yam Karkai launched the World of Women network with her partner Raphael Malavieille in July, dropping a collection of 10,000 diverse female NFT avatars. According to the group, research published in November shows female artists accounted for 5% of all NFT art sales in the prior 21 months.  World of Women has seen a dramatic rise to the top of the NFT charts since its launch in November, touting a 7.1 ETH (roughly $17,500) floor price on secondary marketplace OpenSea. The project has benefited heavily from promotion by actress Reese Witherspoon, whose media company Hello Sunshine partnered with the project in February.  The WoW Foundation will use the funding to launch a virtual academy for artists and invest in diverse and inclusive spaces for women in Web 3 within the metaverse. The group said it aims to encourage more female participation by acting as an incubator and providing advice, funding, mentoring and access to The Sandbox network. The Sandbox is a subsidiary of blockchain gaming giant Animoca Brands.  Read more: Web 3 and the Metaverse Are Not the Same  Free online lessons on Web 3 will also be given through an immersive experience in The Sandbox, and once students have completed the course they will be certified and receive an “NFT diploma.”  “Through facilitating the education and funding of women’s projects we hope these programs help establish a generation of influential women builders in the space,” said Sebastien Borget, co-founder and chief operating officer of The Sandbox, in a press release.

A single trader or several traders bought more than 36,000 contracts of Deribit-listed ether put option expiring on March 18, of which more than 20,000 were blocked on institution-focused over-the-counter tech platform Paradigm, according to Swiss-based data tracking firm Laevitas. The put option buyers would make money if ether drops below $2,200 by March 18. That's a roughly 13% decline from the current market price of $2,514.  ""We witnessed strong demand for 18 March, 2200, puts yesterday as players looked to buy short-dated protection on the key 2,200 pivot level in ETH,"" Patrick Chu, director of institutional sales and trading at over-the-counter tech platform Paradigm, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.  Deribit, the world's largest crypto options exchange by trading volumes and open positions, and Paradigm introduced an institution-focused block-trading service three years ago. Trades facilitated by Paradigm are automatically executed, margined and cleared at Deribit. A block trade is typically a high-volume transaction privately negotiated between two parties and executed over-the-counter.  On Deribit, one ether options contract represents one ETH. A put option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A put buyer is implicitly bearish on the market, while a call option purchaser is bullish.  Savvy traders holding long positions in the spot or futures market typically buy put options when they are concerned about a temporary drop in the asset's price. However, sometimes traders treat options as vehicles for speculation, expressing their bearish bias through a long position in put options or by creating spreads – buying puts near the current market price and selling an equal amount of puts below the market price.  According to Laevitas, most of the trades in the $2,200 put registered on Monday were straight forward longs and did not appear to be part of a complex options strategy. ""Most of them were outright trades, possibly short-term hedges,"" Laevitas said in a Twitter chat.  Since November, ether has been trending lower. Sellers ran out of steam around $2,200 in late January, establishing the psychological figure as crucial support.  Since late January, the options market has consistently shown a bearish bias across all timeframes, with the one-week, one-, three- and six-month put-call skews returning positive values. Put-call skews measure the cost of puts relative to calls.",NEUTRAL,ETH,ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/08/large-ether-options-flow-guards-against-price-slide-below-22k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f9d77d7a8535fba7730a8f24df323684eff11539-1200x800.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375183,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw69Cz,1646723640,A New NFT Grouping Is Born: Minorities Promoting Their Cultures,"In July 2021, sitting in his home in Singapore, Amar Bedi had an idea.  He imagined a digital identity, a non-fungible token (NFT), that resembled him. Bedi is a turbaned Sikh, an identity associated with Sikhism, the fifth-largest faith in the world.  Bedi visualized an NFT platform that would capture the various identities of his people and provide representation to an under-represented community in the metaverse. It would be called MetaSikhs.  Around the same time in Los Angeles, Doaa Alhawamdeh and Karter Zaher were enamored by a similar idea – bringing the NFT world the “first token” to represent Muslims in the Metaverse. They decided the NFT would be called Hijabi Queens and Bearded Kings.  There was no coordination, no idea of the other's existence, no collective movement, and yet, in Montreal, Oren and his wife Rebecca, had also envisioned a strikingly similar project – “the first Jewish NFT project.” They called it “The Kiddush Club,” a collection of 3,600 digital art “mensches.”  The couple, who asked not to share their last names out of concern for their privacy, chose the name the “Kiddush Club” since it is also a slang term for Jewish adults who socialize in a fun way during or after Shabbat prayer services.  At their core, the ideas behind these different NFT projects are motivated by a similar history of conflict.  NFTs born from conflict  Rebecca and Oren said their idea was born in part from conflict: the “crazy rise of antisemitism” in recent times. This even as Russia’s President Vladimir Putin said he would “denazify” Ukraine and commentators noted the irony that Ukraine’s president is Jewish. In the fog of war, identity and unity are major motivating factors for the couple.  “There’s been a lot of fear in the Jewish community, and we have been trying to educate people, protect the community and defend ourselves, but it's hard. It’s been a lot to handle. Personally, it’s taken a big toll on me. So this was about bringing the community together in a fun way,” Rebecca said.  It wasn’t just an external conflict for the recently married couple, it was also internal.  “You’ll notice in the project; a lot of different traits were designed. Some of them are inclusive of disability, so there are hearing aids and a wheelchair, along with different styles of Jews. Our son was born with a very complex medical disease. So, he was the inspiration behind a lot of this,” she said.  The creators of Hijabi Queens, Alhawamdeh and Zaher, are a Palestinian-Jordanian couple. Alhawamdeh’s motivation is also multifold, and a big part of it is the fact that her “grandparents were Palestinian refugees.”  “They were brutally forced into concentration camps in Palestine and sent out by force to the neighboring country Jordan, and that’s where my parents were born. In the ‘90s, searching for the American dream, my parents moved to America, and I was born in New York City,” Alhawamdeh said.  She explained how both of them came from “war-torn histories. Karter escaped war in Lebanon when he was 12 years old.”  The intent behind MetaSikhs, founded by Bedi, Karun Arya and D-jeetal (who operates under a pseudonym), was to “really understand this space and how NFTs really work,” but also history.  Sikhs have faced hate crimes in 1907, gun violence in 2021 and continue to face discrimination and violence in 2022.  “This is a strong use case of creating awareness about who Sikhs are,” said Bedi.  Inclusive of diversity  The creators of these NFT projects were not aware of the other, similar projects, but expressed a collective sense of validation and excitement.  “I absolutely love it. As a matter of fact, our neighbors to our left and underneath us are Jewish, and we have had what we call family dinners (laughs). We have an awesome friendship with them. I personally love to see minority communities stick to their roots, beliefs as long as they are kind, and not trying to enforce it on their neighbors,” Alhawamdeh said.  Hijabi Queens is a multinational project. The LA-based founders searched online for collaborators, finding their artists in Colombia and a web developer in Bangladesh.  The projects are strikingly similar in aiming for representation in the global community and supporting subcultures within the communities.  MetaSikhs promotes Sikhs of all appearances – with or without a turban, with or without caps, different hairstyles and different styles of turbans, all of which are closely linked to different beliefs within the faith and associated with different degrees of traditional, cultural or historical sensitivities.  Similarly, the Kiddush Club highlights different aspects of Judaism.  “We thought it would be really cool trying to picture all these different kinds of Jews. Whether you are Ashkenazi, Sephardi, religious or not religious, Orthodox, Reform or Conservative. I don’t even tend to like those labels. For me a Jew is a Jew, it doesn’t matter who you are or where you come from,” Rebecca said.  Is it just a token to represent a minority identity? I.e., is this like a CryptoPunk or Bored Ape, just with a different type of art?  The NFT creators emphasize that this is not just about the representation of a minority identity. For Bedi, MetaSikhs allows collectors a colorful and vibrant representation of their identity “to bridge global communities through art inspired by culture.”  The Hijabi Queens team is motivated by empowering Muslim women and how the NFT “serves to solidify a network of Muslim creators and entrepreneurs.”  Rebecca said, “while we hope the NFT acts as a digital identity for Jewish people in the same way that CryptoPunks or Bored Ape Yacht Club is a social signal.”  All three platforms promise a variety of additional resources to holders. For instance, access to certain channels in their Discord, IRL events, master classes and networking opportunities.  In terms of governance rights, holders of The Kiddush Club token (TKC) will have the ability to vote on which charities the club supports, and MetaSikhs plans to involve the community after it launches its first collection. Hijabi Queens has not yet revealed a governance rights aspect but has communication channels to encourage robust discussion to influence the future of the platform.  Cultural appropriation?  These NFT creators have faced scrutinizing questions about rug pulls and cultural appropriation for profit.  “A lot of people think this must be a scam. A big part of why we are doing this is to onboard a lot of new people and do a lot of education in the NFT space along with a sense of Jewish pride,” Oren said.  Bedi said that “for the amount of time we have invested, the intention was never that we would make x amount of money that would take us to the moon.”  Rather, the creators said, the project promotes cultural pride. While proceeds will go to their creators, a percentage of the gains will go to charity.  The Kiddush Club and MetaSikhs, as guided by their faiths, have both pledged 10% of their earnings to charity. MetaSikhs has also committed to reinvesting 5% of its primary sales in NFT art by emerging artists.  Education as a form of decentralized representation is also key to their vision. Rebecca said how “onboarding the community into Web 3” is a major aspiration, and it’s on their social channels where most of the education takes place.  The founders of Hijabi Queens have baked in an educational strategy to empower women by holding weekend classes to teach them about building wealth, crypto, financial freedom and NFTs.  “We had to start from the basics. Our sisters didn’t know what an NFT or crypto was. Now, in less than a month, these sisters are teaching others,” Alhawamdeh said.  The concept of education through visual identity is core to the tenets of the organizations.  “Each individual MetaSikhs NFT (2,112 unique collectibles) will include different traits, and we want each collector to think about every aspect of their MetaSikh and what it means to them to encourage a meaningful dialogue with others about art, culture and community,” Bedi said.  For Bedi and his team, MetaSikhs is a medium to create awareness about Sikhs, not just for others but within his community too.  “There is a loss of understanding around what it means to be a Sikh. While it’s easy to identify a turban and that becomes a core discussion topic – what does it mean to have one and be a Sikh – most people don’t know the core values within and outside the community, unfortunately. The three core tenets are meditation, earning an honest living and doing charity, and this gets lost under the more cultural influences of religion,” Bedi said.  The MetaSikhs NFTs reflect all the shades of Sikhs and therefore raise a question about which visual representation is in line with Sikhism. That question, in turn, leads to understanding what Sikhism is at its core and therefore awareness is created.  MetaSikhs is creating digital representations of female Sikhs too. Hijabi Queens has a roadmap for Bearded Kings. The Kiddush Club is also aiming to represent female Jews.  Rebecca explained how as a woman in a male-dominated NFT space, she is “really proud of working on NFTs to bring Jews in the metaverse.” She added that “there is now a new focus for women-focused projects” citing the NFT project World of Women (WoW) as one example. It has become a celebrity NFT phenomenon.  Celebrity partnerships  All three projects are hoping to partner with well-known individuals of their respective faiths to spread the word about the respective NFTs.  MetaSikhs is in talks with celebrities for partnerships, and both Hijabi Queens and Kiddush Club have secured celebrity partners.  The Club has partnered with Rudy Rochman, a Jewish-Israeli rights activist who was physically removed from a bus in London for being Jewish.  Hijabi Queens’ Zaher was originally a musician. He reconnected with his bandmate Jae Deen recently. The name of their band is Deen Squad. Deen means faith so the literal translation of the meaning of the band name is “faith squad.”  The band’s innovative “Islamic” versions of mainstream billboard megahits – such as “God’s Plan” by Drake and “Havana” by Camila Cabello achieved virality and attention from the likes of BBC and CBC. The two hope to leverage their past work to build a celebrity partnership.  “We believe that we have the know-how in the celebrity-sphere to build celebrity partnerships in the future,” Alhawamdeh said.  Dates and roadmaps  Almost all the creators have been moonlighting, investing their own money and making partnerships to bring the projects to life. None of these projects have launched yet but are expected to in the near future. The MetaSikhs collection of 2,112 NFTs was available for presale in December 2021, and was minted on Feb. 21, 2022.  In an environment where scam projects and rug pulls have occurred often, MetaSikhs promises to curate and grow the community by launching a companion collection.  The Kiddush Club is expected to announce a launch date for 3,600 mensches soon. They too plan new projects that would expand the existing community.  “We have been getting a lot of requests for female mensches, which we plan to launch as well in the near future. We really like the idea of having one big community with sub-communities within it,” Rebecca said  Anyone can buy the NFTs on any platform, even if, like the Hijabi Queens, some “encourage their NFT holders to seek value in our Muslim networking utility,” Alhawamdeh said.  The Hijabi Queens presale for 500 NFTs sold out in two minutes on March 2, 2022.

The 50 and 100-day EMAs take a sharp reversal and might shortly give a bullish crossover in the daily chart. Moreover, the rally continues after a 200-day EMA retest.

The collection of 19,840 NFTs has been minted on Tezos and takes the form of nine different pizza delivery hot bag designs.  The NFTs will be dropped on several dates in early March.  This is not Papa John's first foray into the world of crypto and blockchains. The take-out chain last year launched a promotion in which customers could win £10 ($13) worth of bitcoin (BTC) when they spent more than £30 ($39).  The campaign fell afoul of the UK's Advertising Standards Authority, who deemed it ""irresponsible"" as it ""took advantage of consumers’ inexperience or credulity and trivialized investment in cryptocurrency."" The pizza chain subsequently removed the ads for the campaign.  Papa John's has a long-standing association with cryptocurrency owing to the infamous occurrence of an early bitcoin user spending 10,000 BTC on two Papa John's pizzas in 2010. The bitcoin, worth $41 at the time, would be worth nearly $400 million at today's prices.
