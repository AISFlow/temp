42424016,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2jklh,1640129432,First Mover Asia: Asia Bump Sends Bitcoin Over $49K,"(Edited by James Rubin)  Good morning. Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market moves: Bitcoin rose above the $49,000 level, hours after a price pump during Asian hours. The U.S. market has been largely quiet during the holiday week.  Technician’s take (Editor’s note): Technician’s Take is taking a holiday hiatus. In its place, First Mover Asia is publishing the first in a series of stories on the year in cryptocurrency markets by markets analyst Damanick Dantes.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $49,071 +4.65%  Ether (ETH): $4,024 +2.4%  Markets  S&P 500: $4,649 +1.7%  DJIA: $35,492 +1.6%  Nasdaq: $15,341 +2.4%  Gold: $1,789 -0.1%  Market moves  After a price bump during Asian hours, bitcoin was well above the $48,000 level for all of Tuesday after the opening of U.S. markets. At the time of publication, bitcoin had soared beyond the $49,000 threshold.  While bitcoin sellers have dominated the market during Asian hours for most of 2021, as CoinDesk has reported, the gains happened earlier Tuesday. This timing suggested that the sell-off related to China’s strengthened crypto trading ban may be ending soon.  “With Huobi completing its China exit last week, the selling pressure from Asia appears to be slowing down,” Hong Kong-based crypto lender Babel wrote in its weekly newsletter dated Tuesday.  Crypto exchange Huobi said in September that it will retire all existing users in mainland China by the end of this year, after China announced tougher measures on crypto trading.  On a more positive note, bitcoin’s illiquid supply has been increasing since a drop in May, reaching above 14 million, according to data from blockchain data firm Glassnode. The so-called illiquid supply shows the total supply of the oldest cryptocurrency held by illiquid entities.  With roughly 70% of bitcoin considered as “illiquid,” it suggests that “the supply of bitcoin available for purchase by new entrants is decreasing,” according to Babel.  It “will strongly support the price when bullish sentiment returns,” Babel added.  Market wrap  Market Wrap Year-End Review: Bitcoin Starts Off in a Frenzy: In this first episode of Market Wrap’s review of crypto markets in 2021, we recall the powerful rally that ushered in the new year. Retail traders piled in, even as some institutional investors sounded warnings about rampant speculation. (By Damanick Dantes)  Hello, Market Wrap readers! During the final two weeks of 2021, we’re using this space to recap this year’s most dramatic moments in cryptocurrency markets – and highlight the key lessons from this fast-evolving corner of global finance. Over a series of eight posts starting on Dec. 20 and running through Dec. 30, we’ll recap what shook crypto markets this year. (For the latest crypto prices and news headlines, please scroll down.)  In our first episode today, we show how, even as bitcoin’s price soared in the early days of the year, some savvy institutional investors were already growing cautious on cryptocurrencies after a wave of buying during the fourth quarter of 2020.  Bitcoin (BTC) started 2021 on a strong note, gaining nearly 40% during the first week of January and surging to a new all-time high around $40,000.  But not everyone was convinced the rally could be sustained.  Retail traders piled in, while some institutional investors started to raise concerns about rampant speculation.  As early as December, Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at crypto asset management firm Arca, had told CoinDesk that “there is a good chance that actively managed hedge funds and passive indexes built around high allocations to bitcoin have a very short shelf life.”  Indeed, a few funds established bitcoin positions but did not “hold on for dear life” – a commonly misconstrued back-formation of the crypto-jargon term “HODL,” which originally appeared as a fast-typing (or maybe drunk?) person’s attempt to type the world “hold.”  Bitcoin quickly advanced from $30,000 to $40,000 within the first five trading days of January – an impressive gain that fueled even more market excitement. The sharp price rise in BTC contributed to a $1.1 billion profit for Ruffer Investments, a U.K. based investment management firm, in just five months. By June, Ruffer stated that a “speculative frenzy” in cryptocurrencies forced the firm to exit its bets on further gains.  And Ruffer was not alone in its concern about market exuberance. Volatile price swings caused other institutional investors to doubt a prolonged crypto rally.  Sure enough, by the end of January, bitcoin had declined about 30% from a January high of near $40,000. Shortly after the price drop, Scott Minerd, chief investment officer at the Guggenheim global investment firm, said he didn’t believe bitcoin’s investor base was “big enough” or “deep enough” to keep prices at current levels.  “Right now, the reality of the institutional demand that would support a $35,000 price or even a $30,000 price is just not there,” he said.  At the same time, a JPMorgan analyst said a bearish outlook could be triggered if bitcoin failed to claw its way back over $40,000, leading to steeper losses over the ensuing weeks.  Demand from institutional investors was said to have been the cause for the astronomical rise of the top cryptocurrency by market capitalization in the fourth quarter of 2020, when Paul Tudor Jones, Stanley Druckenmiller and MicroStrategy said they had jumped into the market.  As coming installments of this series will show, the rest of 2021 would be defined by market-moving tweets from electric-vehicle billionaire Elon Musk, rapid price rallies in barely-heard-of alternative cryptocurrencies, a fresh wave of corporate buy-in to the legitimacy and potential of digital assets, plenty more moments of extreme volatility – and, eventually, a new all-time high of around $69,000.

The crackdown saw the mass exodus of bitcoin miners out of the presumed mining capital of the world as the Chinese government ramped up its efforts to push the miners out. During this time, the mining hash rate from the region had crashed to nearly zero. Miners moving out of the country had had to quickly move their mining rigs and find new homes for them. During this time, the hash rate and by extension, the price of bitcoin, had suffered extensively but with time, bitcoin miners had found their footing in other places like the United States.

42420827,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYlDB,1640125422,Crypto VCs Are Making a Big Bet on Gaming Guilds. Why?,"Whether it is Yield Guild Games’ $22.4 million in funding or GuildFi’s $6 million seed round, big-name crypto venture funds Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), DeFiance Capital and Pantera Capital are looking beyond crypto games themselves to the co-ops of the metaverse.  Game guilds provide gamers with the necessary funds and tools to experience a growing roster of “play-to-earn” titles – all in exchange for a cut of players’ earnings. Here’s an example: Because buying an axie on the popular crypto game Axie Infinity can be quite expensive, some guild users are willing to put some of their earnings toward renting in-game assets from the guild.  If 2021 has proved to be a year for crypto games and their tokens, will 2022 become the year for gaming guilds that support hot gaming venues such as Axie Infinity or The Sandbox? It’s too early to tell but crypto investors rolling in bull-market returns are putting up funds just in case.  Why guilds click  Unlike traditional gaming guilds, which are organized groups of game players who play on a regular basis together in a game, crypto gaming guilds do not rise and fall with the game. Instead, they aim to become a platform to support new gamers.  That also explains why investors are making a big bet on crypto guilds: There are hundreds of crypto games hoping to become the next Axie Infinity.  Data from DappRadar shows there are about 106,000 daily active users on Axie Infinity, or unique wallet addresses interacting with the game, as of press time, down from its November peak at around 135,800.  “If games are the homerun high risk/high reward punts, guilds would be the blue chip industry juggernauts standing the test of time,” Darryl Wang, senior investment analyst at crypto investment firm DeFiance Capital, wrote on Twitter. “High quality guilds will effectively become a top metaverse index for the best games available to players.”  Wang’s company has invested in several crypto gaming guilds, including GuildFi and Merit Circle.  According to Akaradet Diawpanich, co-founder of GuildFi, the gaming guilds in crypto can potentially create a “positive feedback loop” in which they onboard players to games, purchase gaming non-fungible tokens (NFT) and lend them to players, invest in different games and help them target prospective users.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Diawpanich said GuildFi started expanding after it found heightened demand for leased assets during the crypto gaming boom amid the COVID-19 pandemic. GuildFi is now also providing gadgets for gamers in different games. For instance, Axie players can monitor their daily smooth love potion (SLP) token rewards on GuildFi.  Eventually, GuildFi, according to Diawpanich, is trying to become Steam, a video game distribution service, for crypto games.  Why tokens?  Not surprisingly, YGG, GuildFi and Merit Circle – some of this year’s more successful crypto guilds – all have their own tokens. But even the most valued among them, YGG, has a market capitalization of $461 million, according to CoinGecko, far from the value of gaming-sector darlings AXS ($6.6 billion) or MANA ($4.4 billion).  In an analysis piece on crypto gaming guilds, Wayne Zhao, partner at Beijing-based blockchain data firm TokenInsight, wrote that some guilds in the traditional gaming ended badly after members of the guilds found out community leaders were being paid by gaming companies to promote specific games.  With the launch of tokens, however, crypto guilds potentially solve the “over-centralization” problem of traditional gaming guilds, according to analysts.  “Traditional gaming guilds [act] as social coordinators, but nothing more,” DeFiance Capital’s Wang told CoinDesk. “Crypto gaming guilds take on a much more important economic role given the nature of on-chain digital assets players use and interest with.”  A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) can gather a group of random people with different motivations together to build and grow together because of shared incentives, Zhao said in an interview with CoinDesk.  “At the core, the token is one of the incentives for members to participate in the group decision-making process,” Zhao said of guild governance. Each individual can benefit from the overall profit earned.  Gaming guild downside  That said, the problem of having a token for a gaming guild is obvious, too.  According to YGG’s white paper, the value of YGG token is heavily dependent on yields generated from YGG treasury’s assets – including the NFTs it owns. That means the token’s performance is based on the popularity of crypto games as well as the value of NFTs.

42411625,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glP4yD,1640125215,Another Crypto All-Time High in 2021: Regulatory Handwringing,"We made it! 2021 is coming to a close, the U.S. Congress is on vacation, and we very likely won’t have a Christmas Eve President’s Working Group statement again. As we wrap up this year, it’s worth taking a look at what actually happened over the past 12 months.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  2021 in review  The narrative  It’s been a long, strange year. I wanted to revisit the first issue of this newsletter from January as we get close to the end of 2021 and see how the regulatory sector around this industry has developed since then.  Why it matters  Are we any closer to that fabled regulatory clarity for digital assets in the U.S.? I don’t actually know if there’s a real answer to this yet. There are certainly efforts being made to get there, but by and large this year felt like a reinforcing of existing norms rather than truly novel regulatory standards for the industry.  Breaking it down  When I started this newsletter, I pointed to what I thought would be some key issues to watch for this year. Let’s see how I did:  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) will all see a change in leadership. Next year, so will the Federal Reserve.  SEC Chair Gary Gensler has been in office nearly nine months, and while the industry isn’t too thrilled with what he’s done so far, under his watch bitcoin futures exchange-traded funds (ETF) and mutual funds began trading. The SEC is also continuing to investigate projects it believes may have violated federal securities law, such as Terraform Labs and the Mirror Protocol.  Perhaps more intriguingly, Gensler has suggested that Congress enact legislation granting a single federal regulator broad authority over crypto spot markets, positioning the SEC as the appropriate agency to take on this role.  Acting CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam has similarly suggested that his agency might be the best fit, pointing out that the majority of the market cap for cryptocurrencies listed on U.S. trading platforms comes from commodities (i.e., bitcoin and ether). Gensler’s argument has been that the majority of the cryptocurrencies on trading platforms appear to be securities. They’re not mutually exclusive positions.  The OCC has operated under Acting Comptroller Michael Hsu for most of the year. More on this below.  U.S. President Joe Biden actually nominated Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to a second term, so we will not be seeing a change in leadership at the central bank. That being said, the Fed is now approaching inflation and the tail end of the second year of the coronavirus pandemic differently than it approached in the first year, so we’ll still have to see how this change in view impacts these broader economic concerns.  The SEC is suing Ripple Labs and two executives on allegations they sold XRP in unregistered securities sales for over seven years, which has implications for companies that didn’t conduct initial coin offerings but may have still sold tokens.  Attorneys for both the SEC and Ripple have spent much of the last year filing administrative proceedings and sorting out issues of discovery. We haven’t actually gotten to the substantive part of the case in court yet, so this remains TBD.  The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is considering a number of rules that bring crypto transactions under closer scrutiny.  Remember how 12 months ago the entire industry was laser focused on the proposed FinCEN unhosted wallet rule? Good times.  While FinCEN, a unit of the U.S. Treasury Department, has played a role in addressing the ransomware crisis and has reported an uptick in crimes conducted using cryptocurrency (again, chiefly ransomware related), the wallet rule has dropped out of sight and the agency hasn’t announced any new measures.  The OCC has issued a number of interpretative letters over the past year under an acting head that powerful Democrats on the Financial Services Committee already want overturned.  While Acting Comptroller Michael Hsu has announced the OCC’s work under former Acting Comptroller Brian Brooks is being reviewed, we haven’t seen anything overturned yet.  That being said, the OCC has seemingly stopped granting trust charters to crypto companies, so at most we seem to be in a sort of limbo period as that review continues.  Congress will consider how it can implement new real-time payments services and boost financial inclusion this year, targeting two goals that the crypto community has long discussed. This is a conversation the industry wants to participate in.  I … don’t think this happened? Issues like the bipartisan infrastructure law and the Build Back Better bill seem to have taken up a lot of Congress’s attention. I don’t even remember if FedAccounts actually made a significant appearance during a congressional hearing this year. Certainly not enough to stand out.  Democrats are furious at Republicans who they think helped incite the attempted Capitol insurrection in January, and that could have implications for crypto-friendly legislation spearheaded by representatives who objected to the Electoral College vote.  So a) this fury seems to have died down pretty quickly but b) we haven’t seen votes on almost any kind of crypto-specific legislation, so that’s a wash anyway. We are seeing the tide in Congress potentially shift, though, with (a) hearing(s) focused on largely substantive issues rather than just listing concerns in lieu of conversing with the industry.  The biggest regulatory story in the U.S. probably came in the form of the bipartisan infrastructure bill and its crypto broker tax provision. While that bill is now a law, efforts to modify the broker provision are ongoing.  A similarly big story seems to be the launch of bitcoin futures ETFs, which saw some $1.4 billion in inflow in fairly short order.  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  We are nearly at the end of 2021 and I think it’s (hopefully) safe to say we will not have many more updates, if any, to this chart this year.  That being said, earlier this month CFTC Commissioner Dawn Stump announced she does not want to serve another five-year term at the commodities regulator after her term expires in April 2022. It’s unclear when she plans to leave – it could be as soon as April or up to 18 months later (depending on whether the commissioner waits for a successor to be nominated and confirmed by the Senate).  Similarly, SEC Commissioner Elad Roisman announced his intention to depart the securities regulator at the end of January 2022 (although his term doesn’t expire until June 2023).

42424002,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2jkVh,1640121401,"Rari Capital, Fei Protocol Token Holders Approve Multibillion-Dollar DeFi Merger","After less than a month of deliberation and voting, two decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) have consummated one of the biggest mergers in decentralized finance (DeFi) history.  On Tuesday, at Ethereum block height 13850929, a vote to merge Rari Capital and Fei Protocol was approved by members of both DAOs. The measure passed by a 93% to 1% margin among Rari’s RGT holders and 90% to 0% rate among those with Fei’s TRIBE. Going forward, the projects will merge via a token swap and be united under the TRIBE token.  A total of 103 wallet addresses participated in the election. The joint effort will immediately command $2 billion in total value locked (TVL).  While the merger between xDAI and Gnosis earlier this month also featured a token swap, this is the largest DAO merger featuring a governance token integration to date.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Fei founder Joey Santoro said the historic deal was at times unwieldy – especially when both token holder communities initially seemed skeptical of one another – but he and Rari co-founder Jai Bhavnani were aligned in their desire to move quickly on a deal.  Read more: Rari Capital, Fei Protocol Look to Overcome Bagholder Bias in Ambitious DeFi Merger  “It was really challenging to navigate a proposal this big. There were two whole DAOs worth of cooks in the kitchen. But Jai and the core teams and I were devoted to putting this out there,” said Santoro.  Per the terms of the merger, Rari’s RGT token holders will be able to exchange their tokens at a rate of 26.7 TRIBE to RGT at any point within a 180-day window. Additionally, TRIBE holders dissatisfied with the deal will have a three-day window to exchange TRIBE for a proportional share of Fei Protocol’s treasury.  Terms and conditions  In addition to requiring social consensus from the two investor communities, the merger is technically a complex one, requiring multiple custom contracts and multiple on-chain votes.  Initially crypto research firm GFX Labs attempted to lend some engineering heft, but ultimately backed out as the community balked at GFX’s requested $3.5 million price tag vested over two years.  As a result the teams built the contracts related to exchanging RARI for TRIBE, as well as a “ragequit” function – a contract that allows token holders to exchange their tokens for a proportional share of the protocol’s treasury, a feature first iterated in Ethereum ecosystem grants organization MolochDAO.  According to Santoro, the ragequit function was instituted in part to appease TRIBE holders dissatisfied with the terms of the deal.  “The ragequit allows TRIBE token holders, especially token holders that market-bought TRIBE below treasury value, to exit at intrinsic value. Adding that in made everyone aligned,” he said.  The ragequit will be live for three days, and may be reinstituted if TRIBE ever trades below treasury value. Santoro declined to speculate on how widely it’ll be used, but said that instituting the function was a byproduct of two ambitious teams that wanted to move quickly on a merger rather than hash out technicalities.  “After a certain point, you can’t keep debating. You have to say, ‘We’re over the line here. We’re going to keep executing,’” he said.  Oversight and management  Now that the votes have passed, the real experiment arguably begins: Can two separate teams with disparate leadership structures operate efficiently under the same governance token?  DAO management has come under scrutiny in recent weeks, following the high-profile failure of ConstitutionDAO to acquire a rare copy of the constitution, and infighting within Sushi leading to the departure of CTO Joseph Delong.  Read more: Sushi CTO Joseph Delong Resigns After Reports of Project Infighting  However, there are instances of multilayered or fractionalized DAOs working well. MakerDAO, which deploys a series of cloistered “core units,” recently announced a $20 million bond experiment with French multinational banking giant Société Générale.  Santoro believes TRIBE’s multi-tiered structure will lend itself to managing the two teams. Additionally, he noted that if there are conflicts and potential power struggles, the DAO can institute new governance structures with a vote, but that after multiple meetings the two teams are currently aligned.  “We see the world in similar ways,” Santoro said. “We’ve also had hard internal discussions – this wasn’t all kumbaya idealism, but we got it sorted like adults and I’m extremely bullish on our ability to coordinate and cooperate as equals, and if it doesn’t work we’ll vote in a structure that does.”  New products, new acquisitions  The first product from the joint project is expected to launch in “late January, early February,” said Santoro.  Additionally, the team is looking to expand further via DAO acquisitions.  “TRIBE is moving towards becoming full-stack DeFi infrastructure,” said Santoro. “We’re trying to fill all the product gaps and become an in-house mega-DAO.”  He mentioned automated market makers (AMM), structured products and derivatives as acquisition and/or expansion targets.  The expenditures are notable given that other teams are preparing their treasuries for a possible looming bear market, but Santoro sees further expansion as strategically advantageous:  “I think long term it’ll be more beneficial for us to join forces with sick teams than it would be to preserve assets. And it’s not like we have this huge burn-through. We’re lean teams. We’re ready to ride out a bear.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/12/21/rari-capital-fei-protocol-token-holders-approve-multibillion-dollar-defi-merger,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f69e996a3f54677bf465dc85c2b16444ef491f43-600x336.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42424023,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2jkrh,1640120802,Market Wrap Year-End Review: Musk Pumps Bitcoin and Dogecoin,"Hello, Market Wrap readers! During the final two weeks of 2021 we’re using this space to recap the year’s most dramatic moments in cryptocurrency markets – and highlight key lessons from this fast-evolving corner of global finance. Over a series of eight posts starting on Dec. 20 and running through Dec. 30, we’re recapping what shook crypto markets this year. (For the latest crypto prices and news headlines, please scroll down.)  On Monday, we recounted how even as bitcoin staged a powerful price rally to the start of the year, some institutional investors began to question the sustainability of the trend. Today, we’ll show how, during January and February, coordination and posts on social media fueled even more demand for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, delaying an immediate price correction.  As bitcoin (BTC) soared in February, social media, particularly Twitter, appeared to take on an expanded role in cryptocurrency markets, with prices pumping in response to tweet after tweet. It became clear that investor appetite for risk remained strong despite earlier concerns about rampant speculation.  Tesla CEO Elon Musk and then-Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted away to push bitcoin higher from $40,000 in January to nearly $57,000 in February. The viral effects of social media pushed retail traders into full-on buy mode, with bones thrown to the doggy-themed joke token dogecoin (DOGE) that added billions of dollars to that cryptocurrency’s market value.  On social media, some traders banded together in an effort to keep crypto prices elevated – similar to the way retail traders in traditional markets had coordinated to roil stocks like GameStop.  For example, Musk, ranked by Forbes as the world’s richest person, added the #Bitcoin hashtag to his Twitter profile, contributing to an immediate 11% BTC price rally. Shortly afterward, Jack Dorsey also added the #Bitcoin hashtag to his twitter profile.  The bitcoin endorsements by Musk and Dorsey went viral, inspiring a league of traders who dismissed the cautionary warnings of more experienced investors. It all seemed like a lot of fun. And bitcoin was not the only cryptocurrency to advance.  Musk also suggested in a tweet that dogecoin might be “the future currency of earth.” Musk’s involvement in the dog token tribe helped send DOGE mooooning (his word), along with other alternative cryptocurrencies.  Such hijinks kept the crypto party going. Here’s a look at relative performance in January; DOGE vastly outperformed bitcoin in January, as shown below:  How could one man cause such a massive move in crypto markets? CoinDesk’s Edward Oosterbaan explained earlier this month how Musk’s star power was able to sway the price of BTC and DOGE. (Spoiler alert: None of this is all that deep.)  “Musk is far from the only person to move the crypto market for no apparent reason other than making an endorsement,” Oosterbaan wrote. “A sizable portion of the industry from meme coins to NFTs has proven to be highly responsive to celebrity shilling.”  Oosterbaan continued: “High-profile celebrities and Twitter accounts sowing FOMO (fear of missing out) are likely here to stay. The power of social media in the crypto market is testament to the general lack of regulation and maturity, and the inherent liquidity of 24/7, permissionless assets.”  The chart below tracks Musk’s influence on the DOGE price over time, using data from TradingView.  During bitcoin’s swift ascent in January and February, retail traders used social media as a gateway to discover new alternative cryptocurrencies and react to market sentiment in real time.  In just a few tweets, Musk and other popular figures were able to pump and dump coins, leading to significant price gains and losses.  The lesson of this ever-so-bizarre stretch of crypto markets history is that social media was, and still is, a force that’s impossible for traders to ignore.

42411607,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glP4KX,1640115889,"Secure America’s Financial Strength With Stablecoins, Not Central Banks","As they say, change is hard. In a dynamic digital world, it’s tempting to protect ourselves from the pressure of change by simply refusing to acknowledge it and clinging to the status quo. But while that approach may feel comfortable, it’s a poor way for policymakers to manage a national strategy.  Thankfully, there’s another way: embrace change and use it to our advantage.  Jake Chervinsky is head of policy at the Blockchain Association.  When it comes to stablecoins, a rapidly developing type of digital asset, Americans are at an inflection point. Many of us want to embrace stablecoins and use them to improve both the financial system and our competitive standing in the world. Others – particularly those working for legacy institutions – want to stop stablecoin innovation in favor of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) built and controlled by the federal government.  It’s imperative that we support stablecoins and reject a CBDC. Here’s why.  Stablecoins, like other digital assets, run on decentralized public blockchains, meaning anyone can use them without having to rely on a middleman or trusted third party. Unlike other digital assets, stablecoins are designed not to fluctuate in value, instead seeking to track the value of a fiat currency like the US dollar. This means stablecoins aren’t subject to market volatility; they work as a digital version of cash.  CBDCs are similar to stablecoins in tracking the value of a fiat currency, but the similarities more or less end there. Rather than running on permissionless public blockchains, CBDCs are managed by a single central authority with the power to surveil, censor and exclude users. And rather than being developed openly by the private sector, CBDCs are the proprietary creations of government entities.  At last count, more than 80% of central banks were weighing their own form of digital currency, and some had already launched pilot projects. One of the most notable examples is China, which recently cracked down on bitcoin and other digital assets in favor of its CBDC, the digital yuan. Already, roughly 140 million people have opened wallets for the digital yuan.  Some policymakers in Washington are considering whether we should copy China’s example and launch our own competing CBDC. While it’s critical for us to maintain our competitive edge in the digital era, a CBDC is the exact wrong way to achieve that goal.  Read more: The Crypto-Dollar Surge and the American Opportunity - Nic Carter  First, to strengthen the dollar’s dominance as the global reserve currency, our main priority should be to spread dollars far and wide – to make them available to anyone and everyone around the world.  For generations, central banks and financial institutions have held dollars more than any other currency. Yet, in 2020, that number dwindled, falling below 60% for the first time in over 20 years. This drop led famed investor Stan Druckenmiller to warn that he believes the dollar could lose its global reserve status within 15 years.  Stablecoins, on the other hand, are booming. The total supply of stablecoins in circulation grew from under $6 billion at the start of 2020 to nearly $140 billion today. Stablecoins are already expanding the reach of the U.S. dollar, but if the government were to restrict stablecoins in favor of a CBDC, that trend could quickly reverse. If our priority is to spread dollars to every corner of the planet, the best way to succeed is to support the proliferation of stablecoins developed by the next generation of innovative American companies.  Second, we should seek to maximize the contribution of our vibrant and experienced private sector, rather than sidelining it in favor of a centrally-planned government project. While other nations like China might give their central governments total control over emerging industries and technologies, that is decidedly not the American way.  We owe much of our geopolitical strength – and the robustness of our financial markets – to our economic principles of free and open markets, in which our entrepreneurs and companies compete to develop the best products and services possible. That’s exactly what we’re seeing in the stablecoin market now, with the vast majority of leading stablecoin projects home-grown here in the U.S.. This is what our private sector does best.  As Federal Reserve Governor Randal Quarles explained, “A global U.S. dollar stablecoin network could encourage the use of the dollar by making cross-border payments faster and cheaper, and it potentially could be deployed much faster and with fewer downsides than a CBDC.”  Rather than stifling private sector innovation, the government should set common-sense rules of the road that enable innovators to build a responsible, efficient system.  Third, a financial system subject to total control by the government would jeopardize Americans’ fundamental rights to financial freedom and privacy. These issues have come to the forefront in recent years, as the combination of cybersecurity breaches and surveillance capitalism have revealed a dire need for data privacy protection. The last thing we need now is put all of our financial transactions in a centralized database maintained by the government, particularly after the SolarWinds hack showed that even government-held data may not be secure.  This isn’t just a minor concern; it’s an issue of constitutional import. Except in limited cases, the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution requires the government to obtain a warrant before it can search a person’s records. The fundamental right to privacy is a prized American civil liberty and an essential feature of a functioning free society. It’s what separates a nation like the U.S., which respects its citizens’ autonomy and dignity, from one like China, which has exploited technology to create a dystopian surveillance state.  Read more: CoinDesk’s Future of Money Week  Not everyone sees it this way. For some policymakers, stablecoins – like other digital assets – represent a threat to what they perceive as their rightful hegemony over the financial system. For example, SEC Chair Gary Gensler recently said that “the use of stablecoins . . . may facilitate those seeking to sidestep a host of public policy goals connected to our traditional banking and financial system.” In this instance, Chair Gensler has it backwards: The best way to achieve our public policy goals is to support stablecoins, not slow them down.  We’re at the beginning of a revolutionary change to the global financial system thanks to the rise of digital assets running on public blockchains. Although it may not feel comfortable, the best way for us to safeguard America’s financial future is to embrace this new technology and put it to work on our behalf.  Stopping stablecoin innovation to make way for a CBDC would not only contradict our principles. It would harm American consumers, companies and competitiveness.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Jake Chervinsky,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2021/12/21/secure-americas-financial-strength-with-stablecoins-not-central-banks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7affb845c6c7350dfc99a0b86460d7fca6f81d58-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin Open Interest Shows Strong Upwards Movement As pointed out by a CryptoQuant post, the BTC open interest has reversed its trend, and is now showing sharp movement up. The &apos;open interest&apos; is an indicator that measures the total amount of futures contracts still open at the end of any trading day on derivatives exchanges. The metric takes into account both long and short positions. When the value of this indicator moves up, it can mean market volatility is rising. An increasing open interest may also support the current overall price trend. However, very large values of the metric can imply there is an excess of leverage in the market, which may end up leading to a correction in the price of the crypto. On the other hand, a decreasing open interest value can result in lower market volatility. When the indicator sharply moves down, it can lead to a short or long squeeze due to the sudden price movement (the reverse can also be the case).

42411612,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glP4Xl,1640107452,Web 3 and the Metaverse Are Not the Same,"Of late, the terms “metaverse” and “Web 3″ have been used interchangeably. While they both point to a vision of a better, future internet, it’s important the two concepts not be conflated or become a source of division around ideologies of how we want to continue building the internet.  The metaverse – which gets its name from the 1992 sci-fi novel “Snow Crash” – is more of a vision than a concrete reality. Many people imagine it to be a 3D immersive world that is synchronous, persistent and unlimited in concurrent users. It is a digitally native place where we will spend the majority of our time to work, learn, play, entertain, etc.  Annie Zhang is the host of the “Hello Metaverse” podcast where she explores the cultural and societal implications of its developments. She has been building next-generation social products at various consumer companies.  The metaverse feels vague and speculative because it is; it hasn’t really taken form yet. While some technologists want to anchor the vision along the lines of Meta’s Ready Player One-esque keynote presentation, the reality is the metaverse will require everyone’s input and participation to truly take form. It should encompass the confluence of different iterative efforts and technological advancements and have no discrete end.  Web 3, on the other hand, is a far more specific paradigm that provides clear solutions to specific shortcomings of the Web 2 internet. It is a reaction to the walled-garden ecosystems that platforms like Facebook and YouTube created, which caused people to have their data extracted, privacy breached and ability to control the content they create oppressed. Web 3 subverts that model because it directly addresses the issues of ownership and control.  Read more: A Crypto Guide to the Metaverse  By building on the blockchain, data is open and distributed and collectively owned by peer-to-peer networks. As a result, users own their data, peer-to-peer transactions can bypass middlemen and data lives on the blockchain as a public good that anyone can contribute to and monetize.  We’ve seen incredible new consumer behaviors emerge already from Web 3 initiatives, such as creators being able to sell their content as non-fungible tokens (NFT), play-to-earn games that have helped people make a livelihood playing games and a community-organized investing collective (ConstitutionDAO) mobilizing enough capital to bid for the U.S. Constitution at a Sotheby’s auction.  While Web 3 is a powerful tool to transform how we can manage data, governance and exchange money, the slowness of clearing blockchain transactions limits the settings and use cases in which it makes sense to be applied. Although a purely decentralized model of the internet sounds enticing, there is impracticality to it. So, while it could be argued that Web 3 is a critical building block for the metaverse, it is only one component of a greater sum.  By acknowledging that Web 3 and decentralization are simply a building block for the metaverse, it opens up opportunities for other types of contributors rather than antagonizing them.  When Meta (formerly Facebook) announced its heavily AR/VR-centric metaverse vision, there was an outcry that Big Tech will dominate the metaverse and therefore force platforms to operate as a closed ecosystem once again.  What people missed is the innovation and focus Meta was pushing for was largely on hardware and a 3D user consumption and input interface that, quite frankly, does not exist today. Facebook is trying to solve the immersion problem, and it’s an important one. Think about it. Many of us have spent the last two years on Zoom and have become worn out. How will we feel about wearing a VR headset all day?  If we anticipate spending more and more time in the virtual world enjoyably, we need the virtual interfaces that are more immersive, natural and expressive. Meta’s developments in AR/VR and motion sensing technologies do not undermine the work of Web 3 and decentralization. In fact, the best-case scenario is that people start building Web 3 applications within the emergent 3D form factors of AR/VR and holographic projections.  Another sensationalized opinion is that Web 3 will make Web 2 obsolete. Again, it’s hard to imagine such a reality. Despite certain shortcomings of Web 2, there are still many products that operate more effectively without using the blockchain. Platforms like Discord or Twitch help people communicate and broadcast at scale and in real time. Companies like Uber or DoorDash effectively queue up demand and match it with supply.  Like it or not, centralization works. OpenSea, currently the largest NFT marketplace, is fundamentally a centralized marketplace that simply facilitates transactions on the blockchain. Coinbase is another example of a centralized exchange that enables transactions of cryptocurrencies. In both cases, these intermediaries take service fees on transactions just like any other Web 2 marketplace.  While these hybrid products do not align perfectly to the decentralization ideology, they are critical “bridging products” that help greater adoption of Web 3 elements by appealing to the mainstream. In a similar way that Snap Stories was a popular teen product but struggled with adoption with older users, Meta’s adoption of Stories helped it become a mainstream product for all demographics.  Read CoinDesk’s Culture Week  When new technologies and paradigms emerge, it can often be seen as a revolution. But what we see throughout history is that they tend to build on top of existing foundations from past eras. Email is still a huge part of our day to day lives, and yet it was a protocol invented in the Web 1 era of the internet.  Jon Lai, a GP at investment firm a16z, has a grounded perspective on the development path to the metaverse in this episode of “Hello Metaverse.” “There’s a lot of building yet to be done. The blockchain, play-to-earn, different types of jobs, virtual economics, all of that are like stepping stones [as well as] UGC [user-generated content] platforms and scaling content creation … it won’t be this shining product launch from some company who just says, ‘Hey! We’ve been working on this for 10 years and boom, here’s the metaverse’. It’s going to be the cumulative sum of a bunch of different companies working in completely different spaces on completely different products.”  This is all to say, we need to focus on the interplay between different operating models and how they can work together to create better realities for people rather than focus on their differences and “choosing a side.” While the latest development of Web 3 and efforts to make use cases of the blockchain mainstream is a huge leap forward in our progress in making a better internet, it’s simply one component and it should not neglect other complementary initiatives.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE,Annie Zhang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2021/12/21/web-3-and-the-metaverse-are-not-the-same,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/724eebb2a4e0cf136f499fa4b1eb763fe3e1b13d-3840x2160.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411853,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glghud,1640105184,Investing in Meme Coins? 3 Things Every Crypto Trader Should Know,"Meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shibu Inu coin (SHIB) are among the most well-known so-called altcoins in crypto. Between Elon Musk changing the Twitter logo to the image of the famous Shibu Inu that spawned a million memes, to the fact that in one 12 month period, SHIB saw a 50,000,000% price gain in 12 months, it's easy to see why meme coins grab attention... and investment.  The latest meme coin craze has expanded beyond the world of dogs and into frogs with Pepe Coin, a token which takes its name from the internet meme Pepe the Frog. Just a short while after its launch, one whale had over $1 million in PEPE, which was made with just a small initial investment of .19 ETH (about $385). This story of unbelievable exponential growth in value often attracts new investors to meme coins, but buyer beware: Once you’ve heard about a story like this, you’re probably way too late to the game and are jumping on the bandwagon too late to benefit. In fact, more often than not, investments in meme coins lose value.  It’s important to note that investing in meme coins is an incredibly risky venture and also often results in massive losses through fraud, hacks and exploitation.  Read More: The Psychology of Meme Coins, From Actual Investors  So, the question is, how do you safely invest in these meme coins?  The History of Meme Coins  Before we start detailing the key features to look out for in a credible meme coin, let us first define the concept of meme coin itself. Introduced in 2013, meme coins are usually crypto projects built around meme-worthy themes and animals. For instance, dogecoin (DOGE), the first-ever meme coin, was inspired by the Shiba Inu (a breed of hunting dog developed in Japan) meme sensation (a picture of a presumably smiling Shiba Inu dog) that swept the internet in the early 2010s.  Notably, the success of dogecoin birthed a horde of other dog-themed coins, including the self-proclaimed doge killer (shiba inu coin or SHIB) which briefly surpassed the former in terms of market capitalization earlier this year. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, meme coins are not usually judged based on the utility they provide to users. Instead, more emphasis is placed on the coin’s capability to attract high community engagement. In essence, virality is the single most important factor required to gauge the success of meme coins. With this in mind, what then can you do to identify credible and fake meme coins?  1. Learn how to spot credible and fake meme coins  The project’s goal  Although emphasis is not placed on utility, it is a good sign when the community backing the meme coin project shares something in common, apart from the desire to generate profits. It is a red flag when the entire community’s goal is to pump the value of the coin by encouraging new investors to buy the token hoping that it will drive the price even higher. For instance, SHIB’s community members collectively share the love for Shiba Inu dogs such that part of their goal is to raise funds to rescue strays. Moreover, the project has gone a step further to implement a decentralized exchange called ShibaSwap, in a bid to provide a bit more utility for token holders.  Read More: Shiba Inu: Memes Are the Future of Money  As such, it is critical to research the long-term focus of the project in question and how the project team plans to keep community members engaged with the network. You can do this by perusing the project’s whitepaper, its roadmap (if available) and following updates on the official social network accounts.  The track record of the development team  Those familiar with the crypto industry know that reputation is a vital factor to consider when determining the viability of a product or platform. Hence, it is advisable to unravel the identities of the core contributors of the project and their track records. Note that it may be impossible to find information about the members of the development team due to their decision to remain anonymous. In such cases, you can base your research on the design decisions of the team, especially tokenomics.  Tokenomics refers to the token distribution of cryptocurrencies. Be wary of meme coins where a single entity controls a significant portion of the token’s total supply. Such digital assets are prone to experience a price slump if the major token holder decides to dump (sell off) their coins. Therefore, it is advisable to go for a meme coin whose circulating supply is not concentrated among a handful of investors.  2. How to safely invest in meme coins  There are now hundreds of meme coins all vying for the attention of crypto investors. A hundred of which contain the word “inu” in their name. While many may look legitimate, a majority of meme-inspired cryptocurrencies are simply scam projects designed to capitalize on the growing meme coin trend. You can reduce the risks involved by ensuring that the project is not prone to rug pull scams.  For those unfamiliar with the term, a rug pull occurs when the development teams suddenly sell off all their coins after driving the prices up. Investors are the ones with the rug pulled out from under them, leaving them flat broke as the price of that coin falls abruptly to zero. Squid token and snow dog are two of the most recent examples of meme coins that ended in an alleged rug pull.  Read More: Squid Game Token Crashes; Developers Say They’ve Left the Project  Here are some precautions you need to take to avoid this type of scam:  Avoid coins where developers hold most of the tokens  As mentioned earlier, meme coins concentrated in the hands of a few investors or the development team are risky ventures. Therefore, ensure that no single entity controls over 5% of the token’s supply.  Verify the validity of the liquidity pools  In most cases, meme coins are distributed via automated market makers (AMM). This means when a token first launches, the development team creates a new liquidity pool for investors to use to purchase the token. Liquidity pools are smart contracts that allow investors to swap cryptocurrencies without the need for a third party order book or counterparty. For example, an investor would likely exchange ETH for a new Ethereum-based coin on liquidity pools. To achieve this, the development team must provide liquidity. This is done by depositing both ETH and an amount of the meme coin in a liquidity pool. It is this liquidity that inventors would trade against to get their hands on the newly launched coin.  The problem however is that the liquidity provider, which in this case is the development team, can withdraw liquidity if the appropriate safety system is not put into place. When such incidents occur, the investors are left with no means of exchanging a coin that is fast losing its value. In light of this, it is vital that you only engage with pools held by burn addresses (any wallet address starting with oxoooo), which signals that the liquidity has been permanently locked.  Check the transparency and audit status of meme coin projects  When it comes to digital assets, development teams need to promote an open and transparent ecosystem. More importantly, the underlying code of the cryptocurrency needs to be audited by a reputable third-party software auditing firm such as Certik or Hacken, to ensure that the development team has not implemented back doors that might allow them to initiate an exit scam. Completed audits are usually shared across social media and can be easily found by a quick internet search.  3. How to trade meme coins  When you find a viable meme coin, the next thing you need to consider is how to correctly trade this type of volatile asset. Remember that speculation fuels the prices of meme coins. Hence, you will likely have to contend with high volatility. With this in mind, here are some of the ways to invest in meme coins:  Diversify your investment: Try as much as possible not to put all of your eggs in one basket. In other words, avoid investing all your funds into any single meme coin. Instead, adopt a more measured investment strategy. A share of your portfolio should be allocated to one or multiple meme coins, while the remaining can be distributed among more established and stable cryptocurrencies. A good trade allocation is around 5% of your entire portfolio. So if your portfolio is valued at around $10,000, the maximum you should invest in a single meme coin is $500.  “Hodl” on for dear life: If you are sure of the viability of a meme coin, you can decide to opt for a long-term investment plan whereby you hold your position regardless of short-term price swings. In the instance of shiba inu coin and dogecoin, both cryptocurrencies took a number of years before they soared in value.  Track community sentiment on social media: Do not forget that virality triggers the success of meme coins. Hence, it is advisable to track community engagement and gauge market sentiment to predict price movements. You can do this by visiting Reddit, Discord and Twitter and seeing firsthand what sort of community is building around the project and how many mentions it’s getting. Other tools for measuring sentiment include using subscription services provided by companies such as Intotheblock or The Tie, or “freemium-based” platforms such as Santiment and LunarCrush.  Do not get sucked in by FOMO: When investing or trading meme coins, it is crucial to avoid emotion-based decisions fueled by the fear of missing out (FOMO) or greed. Be as objective as possible when dealing with cryptocurrencies, especially meme coins. Are you buying the meme coin at the top of a rally, or at a more suitable entry point? These are the questions you need to ask.

In a press release, Render Network, which allows digital artists to pay for pooled computer rendering power, said it will double its headcount, improve its “rendering engine” integrations and gear up for non-fungible token issuance as it looks to grow its community.  Rendering is the process of generating a photorealistic or non-photorealistic image from a 2D or 3D model by means of a computer program.  “We have only 10,000 out of potentially tens of millions of artists plugged in,” founder Jules Urbach told CoinDesk. He’s also the CEO of Otoy, a rendering software company closely aligned with the Render Network.  Facebook’s Meta rebranding has driven newfound interest in the future of virtual worlds, including who will own the metaverse. Against that backdrop, the Render project, which pools idle GPUs and pays their operators in RNDR tokens, is perhaps best understood as an infrastructure play.  That prospect captured the interests of key stakeholders in the Solana ecosystem, including lead backer Multicoin Capital, Alameda Research and the Solana Foundation. Sfermion, an NFT venture firm, also participated.  “The funding is essential for growing the Render Network,” Urbach said. “The things that we have to do are, frankly, pretty massive.”  Urbach said the round closed irrespective of Meta headlines. He declined to discuss financials. A representative at Multicoin confirmed the $30 million token deal.  Urbach said activity has “tripled” in recent months as more artists use the network to render complex artwork, such as 3D objects and animation, that their home computer can’t handle.  Render pools idle GPUs to create a peer-to-peer service network that Urbach said rivals Pixar’s massive rendering farms in power and is cheaper for artists than cloud services, like those offered by Amazon.  Its native RNDR, the payments token that node runners receive in exchange for their computing power, is already live on Ethereum and the layer 2 Polygon systwm. Superfast layer 1, or base layer, Solana is next, according to Urbach, who also has his eyes on Metaplex, that ecosystem’s NFT hub.

Called “Metaverse SDK,” the product from Moralis aims to help devs build crypto applications for gaming consoles, desktops and smartphones. It integrates with the popular game engine Unity to support cross-platform gameplay. The software development kit (SDK) covers multiple chains, too.  “This is taking Web 3 to whole new platforms and will allow developers to bring metaverse to the masses,” Liljeqvist told CoinDesk through a spokesman.  It’s a notable picks-and-shovels play as investors and developers pile into digital worlds. The immersive “metaverse” is 10 years out by Facebook’s estimation, but in crypto, a space rife with user-owned gaming gambits and virtual fashion, it has already arrived.  Competing crypto infrastructure companies from Alchemy to Infura haven’t yet branched into gaming SDKs.  Moralis claimed its other SDK products have helped Web 3 developer teams move 10 times faster.

Fitch notes that the European Union is the first major economy to publish draft regulations for the sector and has called for issuers to be regulated like banks or electronic money institutions.  An important regulatory report in the U.S. has also recommended that stablecoin issuers should be treated as insured banks, it added.  Fitch views the U.S. regulatory approach as key to the medium-term development of the sector, as the majority of stablecoins currently traded are linked to the U.S. dollar.  If stablecoin issuers secure charters to operate as deposit-taking institutions, they could “challenge incumbent banks and potentially non-bank payment providers,” the ratings agency noted.  Transparency around the basic aspects of stablecoin arrangements, such as the legal rights of users, and reserve asset holdings, will be foremost when assessing the credit profile of stablecoin issuers, Fitch said.

The note will track the price of bitcoin and be traded in euros.  Bitpanda, which has a valuation of $4.1 billion, said the Bitpanda Bitcoin ETC is listed on Deutsche Boerse’s Xetra market. It plans to add more crypto ETC products in 2022.  The Bitpanda Bitcoin ETC is physically backed by bitcoin kept in cold storage with a regulated custodian. The product is targeting investors looking to “diversify their portfolio and get access to the world of cryptocurrencies,” Bitpanda said.  This year has been characterized by the introduction of physical cryptocurrency-backed exchange-traded products in many jurisdictions, though not in the U.S. Xetra has hosted the introduction of products from 21 Shares, ETC Group and WisdomTree.  Bitpanda’s first ETC is another diversification move for the company founded as a bitcoin exchange in 2014. It has since expanded beyond crypto to offer trading in stocks, precious metals and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) through a mobile app. It has more than 3 million users.  “Issuing an entirely EU [European Union] based Bitcoin ETC with euro as base currency, we are able to offer exposure to an alternative asset class that we feel is ripe for opportunity in the current market environment,” CEO Eric Demuth said in a press release.

Active, current and new users can earn BMEX tokens as of Tuesday.  BMEX tokens are similar to other exchange tokens such as Binance’s Binance coin and FTX’s FTT. Users can earn BMEX based on trading volumes at BitMEX and the fees generated for the exchange. More use cases for the token are expected in the future, as per the post.  BMEX will have a maximum supply of 450 million tokens vested over a period of up to five years, the exchange noted in a separate posthttps://bitmex.freshdesk.com/en/support/solutions/articles/13000092068-how-many-bmex-tokens-are-there-and-what-are-they-used-for-. “The large majority of BMEX will be spent to reward users and grow the BitMEX ecosystem. An allocation of 20% is reserved for BitMEX employees and another 25% for our long-term commitment to the token and ecosystem,” the post added.  The BitMEX story  BitMEX, derived from “Bitcoin Mercantile Exchange,” was founded in 2014 and introduced bitcoin futures to the crypto market. This contributed to a change in market structure as traders could use leverage to place larger bets on the price movements of cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin.  The exchange was also the first to introduce Perpetual Futures, a futures product without time-based expiry date as opposed to traditional market futures, which have an expiry date. Perpetual futures are a market standard these days, with nearly all crypto exchanges offering them instead of time-based futures.  Futures are a financial instrument that allows traders to bet on asset prices without holding the actual asset. Leverage is usually offered on futures, allowing the use of borrowed funds to increase one’s trading position on a relatively smaller initial capital.  “BitMEX ‘degens’ and the ‘trollbox’ were mainstays of the Wild West world of crypto trading before newer exchanges launched and gained relevance after 2017,“ said Tim Behrsin, founder of crypto project Grexie.  “BitMEX issuing tokens is how the exchange remains relevant among new crypto traders spoilt by choice by rival exchanges that offer interest-accruing exchange tokens and discounts based on tokens held. This is evident by the popularity of Binance coin, which has a market capitalization of $89 billion and is the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin and ethereum,” Behrsin said.  BitMEX processed billions of dollars worth of futures volumes in 2018 as the product gained relevance among users. It has since lost volumes to competitors like Binance, Huobi, and FTX, which offer their native tokens to users helping them save on trading fees and offer a wider range of assets to trade.  Analytics tool Glassnode shows bitcoin futures volumes on BitMEX in the past 24 hours was a tad above $1 billion. The 2017-founded Binance, in contrast, recorded over $23 billion in trading volume for a similar product.  However, exchange tokens do not necessarily equate to higher volumes or user base. U.S.-based exchanges Coinbase and Kraken, two of the world’s biggest crypto exchanges by volume, do not offer native tokens to users.  BitMEX has also been in the news in the last few years for its regulatory violations. In 2020, the exchange along with its co-founders were charged by U.S. regulators for facilitating unregistered trading and other violations. In August 2021, BitMEX said it reached a settlement with regards to the the civil charges against the exchange, and will pay a $100 million penalty to the regulators.

42424041,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2jpdh,1640085556,Polkadot Is Deutsche Telekom’s Latest Crypto Experiment,"Europe’s biggest telecommunications company, Deutsche Telekom AG, is throwing its weight behind Polkadot, an interoperable framework of public blockchains created by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood.  Deutsche Telekom’s digital innovation subsidiary, T-Systems Multimedia Solutions (MMS), is no slouch when it comes to supporting blockchain tech.  The telco has already gone deep into the space by providing infrastructure support (as well as participation in) the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms of blockchain oracle service Chainlink; Flow from non-fungible token (NFT) pioneer Dapper Labs; and Celo, a mobile-first payment network.  But by diving into Polkadot, Deutsche’s innovation department is going one step further: T-Systems will not only be providing node-running infrastructure to users staking assets on Polkadot, but the firm has also purchased a “significant” trove of Polkadot’s native cryptocurrency, DOT, to stake on its own behalf, which has involved integrating a crypto business function into the telco’s accounting system.  Read more: Celo Network Adds Deutsche Telekom as Partner; German Telco Buys ‘Significant’ CELO Position  While Polkadot will be the fourth blockchain Deutsche Telekom is working with, it is the first network T-Systems evaluated for running infrastructure, and has been on the firm’s radar from the beginning, said Andreas Dittrich, head of Deutsche Telekom’s Blockchain Solutions Center. As such, T-Systems will be running several validators, both private and public, for the Polkadot network, Dittrich explained.  “Like we did before with Celo, we are also investing in DOT tokens to be able to participate in the governance of the network, and basically put our money where our mouth is to support our infrastructure case,” Dittrich said in an interview with CoinDesk. “The main difference now is that this is not a VC [venture capital] or innovation budget anymore; we are doing this from our business unit. So this really has become a business case for us. I have to say, I’m really proud we are doing this.”  T-Systems may have had to wait a year or two until Polkadot was up and running, but the timing of this audacious move is sharp: The network’s first “parachains” went live over the weekend.  Read more: Polkadot Parachains Go Live, Capping Yearslong Tech Build for Ambitious Blockchain Project  Currently, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, stablecoins and Ethereum-compatibility protocols are the focus of the “layer 1″ networks anchored to the “layer 0″ that is Polkadot. Layer 1 refers to blockchains that run independently of other blockchains – as contrasted with “layer 2″ systems that aim to speed up transactions on existing blockchains like Ethereum.  In terms of use cases that T-Systems might identify, Dittrich pointed to the early days of enterprise blockchain, when Deutsche Telekom joined the Linux-affiliated Hyperledger stable of permissioned ledgers.  “I think the opportunities that Polkadot provides for enterprise use cases are really interesting,” Dittrich said. “It gives you the flexibility and security of a public, permissionless blockchain, but it has both a separation of concerns by parachains, and interoperability among use cases. So even the good old supply-chain use case could make a lot of sense on Polkadot, and I know that big industry consortia are definitely eyeing that ecosystem.”",POSITIVE,DOT,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | DOT | ETH | LINK,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/12/21/polkadot-is-deutsche-telekoms-latest-crypto-experiment,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/17aceefa3d255592b194007d3783d16b6c42b9b0-3000x1643.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

CBDCs are an “additional option,” which is usually better than not having one, Zhao said in a blog post on Tuesday.  “However, as governments and regulators look to create their own CBDCs, I caution them against their very walled-garden nature,” he wrote.  The CEO expects CBDCs to require consumers to ask for permission to use them for certain things, such as investing in projects in different countries. A lengthy approval process to obtain permission would mean it takes longer for CBDCs to be integrated into exchanges, hindering their interoperability with other crypto.  He pointed to the possible role of CBDCs in increasing digital currency adoption by merchants and the potential educational tool they could prove for the masses: “You can’t learn about blockchain without learning about bitcoin. And when you learn about bitcoin, you learn about the valuable fundamental properties of money - scarcity, freedom to transact and low fees,” Zhao wrote  Although central banks across the world are exploring the development of CBDCs, the crypto industry has not completely gotten on board with CBDCs. This is in part due to CBDCs being at odds with the ethos of other digital currencies, which are outside the purview of mainstream finance.  Read more: CBDCs for the People?

42424040,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2jpbh,1640083163,Ethereum Launches Kintsugi Public Testnet Ahead of Move to Proof-of-Stake,"Ethereum opened the Kintsugi testnet to the public on Monday, Tim Beiko, a developer for the blockchain, announced in a post.  Testnets run atop and mimic the activity of the core blockchain, or mainnet, without affecting it. They allow developers and the community to test applications and features in a controlled setting.  Kintsugi, named for the Japanese art of mending broken pottery with gold, is one of the final public testnets before Ethereum 2.0. That’s a plan to convert the blockchain to a proof-of-stake mechanism – one that relies on validators locking up tokens to validate transactions and maintain the network – instead of its current proof-of-work consensus design. Earlier testnets were available only to developers.  “Although client development and UX [user experience] continue to be refined, we encourage the community to start using Kintsugi to familiarize themselves with Ethereum in a post-merge context,” Beiko said. “For application developers, as previously explained, not much will change. Tooling which only interacts with either the consensus or execution layer is also largely unaffected.”  Dubbed a “longer-lived public testnet,” Kintsugi is where anyone can experiment with Ethereum in the exact manner the network would operate after the changeover. This could mean testing niche decentralized finance (DeFi) tools, which rely on smart contracts to provide financial services, to more technical usage of the network.  The move follows a nearly year-long process to shift to Eth 2.0. Four so-called devnets launched in the past year after the Phase 0 launch of the Beacon Chain. The Beacon Chain already stores billions of dollars worth of value, data from on-chain analytics tool Dune Analytics show. It exists separately from the current Ethereum network but will eventually be merged.  Kintsugi is expected to run until it reaches stability along with other testnets, following which a move to Eth 2.0 takes place. “Existing long-lived testnets will run through The Merge. Once these have upgraded and are stable, next up is Ethereum mainnet’s transition to proof of stake,” explained Beiko.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | FIAT | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/12/21/ethereum-launches-kintsugi-public-testnet-ahead-of-move-to-proof-of-stake,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/175b270c818da13a93cad0833c02c8b05ff2015a-5472x3648.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42424042,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2jphh,1640079012,NFTs Are More Popular Than Ever Despite Sour Mood in Wider Crypto Market,"Retail interest in non-fungible tokens (NFT) – digital certificates representing ownership of unique non-interchangeable assets – seems to have decoupled from the broader crypto market. But the search for information isn’t necessarily translating into action.  Google Trends, a tool for gauging general or retail interest in trending topics, is currently returning a perfect score of 100 for the worldwide search query “NFT” over the past five years. That’s a sign more and more people are scanning the web for information on NFTs. In comparison, searches for “bitcoin” and “ether” have eased significantly in recent weeks, with scores hovering below 50. A similar pattern is seen for “dogecoin” and “shiba inu,” the joke cryptocurrencies seen by small investors as leverage plays on bitcoin.  Still, while interest in digital collectibles has remained resilient, perhaps due to several headline-grabbing projects announced in the past few weeks, usage metrics such as daily transaction volume and daily users show the top NFT platforms’ activity has slowed considerably since August.  “In December and November, daily transaction volume on OpenSea, considered to be the most active NFT platform, averaged $67 million,compared to an all-time high of $303 million in August,” FRNT Financial said in its newsletter published Monday.  “Google searches for ‘Non-Fungible Token’ are highest in China, followed by Singapore, Venezuela, Hong Kong and the Philippines,” FRNT Financial said. “Over the past 12 months, the two most popular related search topics are ‘apes,’ due to the Bored Ape Yacht Club Collection, and MetaMask.”  Google Trends provides access to a mostly unfiltered sample of search requests and scales them along a range of 0 to 100, according to the company. The search value represents the search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the selected region and time.  The price of bitcoin, the top cryptocurrency by market value, has dropped by 30% in the past five weeks, dragging the broader market lower and instilling a sense of unease in market participants. The cryptocurrency Fear & Greed Index recently fell below 25, signaling extreme fear.  Interest in digital collectibles may have been buoyed by new projects announced in the past few weeks, FRNT Financial noted.  Last week, former First Lady Melania Trump announced the launch of an NFT series and a non-fungible token platform on programmable blockchain Solana. On Friday, sportswear giant Adidas Originals said it earned $23.5 million from NFT sales.

In August, he tweeted that bitcoin “will unite a deeply divided country (and eventually: world).”  His enthusiasm wanes, however, when it comes to the way Web 3, the third generation of internet services that has been made possible by decentralized networks, is funded.  “You don’t own ‘web3′ The VCs and their LPs do,” Dorsey tweeted, referring to venture capital firms and investors known as limited partners.  The tweet spurred the crypto community on Twitter to react, with some criticizing the former Twitter CEO and others applauding him.  There has been a growing number of VCs investing in Web 3 firms. Most recently Andreessen Horowitz led a $36 million Series A funding round for Web 3 infrastructure company Mysten Labs.  Tesla CEO Elon Musk also weighed in, tweeting: “Has anyone seen web3? I can’t find it.”  Dorsey left the social media giant last month to focus on fintech firm Block, formerly known as Square.

42424045,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2jpnh,1640072225,"Terra Becomes Second-Largest DeFi Protocol, Surpassing Binance Smart Chain","Decentralized payments network Terra is now the second-largest blockchain for decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols in terms of total value locked (TVL). Terra, which is behind Ethereum, crossed Binance Smart Chain (BSC) this week.  On Terra, 13 projects lock over $18.2 billion in value, data from analytics tool DeFi Llama shows. That’s over $1.4 billion per protocol on average compared with an average of $73 million per protocol on BSC, which has $16.5 billion locked on 225 protocols.  The figures are a nearly 42,000% increase compared to December 2020, when DeFi projects on Terra held $42 million in value.  Ethereum retains the DeFi crown with $152 billion in value locked on 361 protocols. DeFi projects rely on smart contracts instead of middlemen for financial services such as lending, trading and borrowing.  DeFi heats up on Terra  Leading the TVL charts on Terra is Anchor, a savings protocol offering low-volatile yields on Terra stablecoin deposits. Anchor locks over $7.7 billion in value and accounts for 42% of Terra’s TVL. Anchor users accrue rewards through a diversified stream of staked rewards from major proof-of-stake blockchains.  Staked assets liquidity provider Lido is next on the list with over $5.4 billion in TVL. In third place is decentralized exchange (DEX) Terraswap, which has seen its TVL increase over 95% in the past week. Terraswap matches peer-to-peer trades between users using Terra’s smart contracts. All liquidity, as on other DEXs, is contributed by the users themselves, in return for token rewards based on the amount of liquidity they provide for each trading pair.  Metaverse and gaming applications have made their mark on Terra as well. The recently launched StarTerra, which calls itself a gamified launchpad that supports nobn-fungible token (NFT) integration, locks up $21 million in value, while LoTerra, a decentralized lottery, holds over $311,000 in value.  The increase in TVL on Terra coincided with the rising price of its LUNA token. The price is up 54% compared to the past week, trading at all-time highs of $83 on Tuesday morning, as per data from CoinGecko.  Some attribute LUNA’s success to both its token mechanisms and use in DeFi applications. “Terra has recently been very successful both in terms of its LUNA coin price and the TVL on its DeFi protocols. The demand for the LUNA token mostly stems from the demand for UST, the algorithmic stablecoin on Terra which is minted using (burning) LUNA,” said Adrian Krion, CEO of Web 3 gaming company Spielworks.  “Unlike other layer 1 blockchains, Terra’s TVL isn’t mainly driven by swap protocols but by savings protocols utilizing so-called bonded tokens, native LUNA tokens which participate in the stabilization of the protocol and thereby generate yield,” he said in a message to CoinDesk.  LUNA was one of the strongest-performing cryptocurrencies in the past month even as the broader market tumbled. Bitcoin and ether have traded in a tight range since November 2021, but tokens of Ethereum rivals Solana and Avalanche have seen gains as traders placed bets on them outperforming Ethereum.  Some in crypto circles refer to investing in SOL, LUNA and AVAX as the SoLunAvax trio, and the trade has netted nearly 400% since May 2021 compared to an equally weighted basket of bitcoin and ether in the same time period.

NFTs: Revolutionizing Ownership NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token - &apos;Non-Fungible&apos; meaning a unique signifier of ownership, and &apos;Token&apos; meaning a cryptographic record in a blockchain. Put together, NFTs are unique records of ownership that are stored in a blockchain. Since NFTs represent ownership, their potential applications are only limited by the human imagination. NFTs are already being used to sell music, heroes in blockchain games, and digital land from metaverse projects, e.g. The Sandbox. Additionally, recent developments in blockchain technology have enabled investors to purchase physical assets with NFTs. This is made possible by tokenization, the process by which physical asset ownership is encoded into a blockchain. This has many implications for the investments world, the most impactful of which is tokenized real estate. Pioneering Metaverse Real Estate NFTs are powered by smart contracts, bits of software that enforce digital agreements. Smart contracts make ownership management through NFTs extremely efficient by handling royalties, payment distributions, and the transfer of legal ownership rights. When applied to real estate, smart contracts take the place of middlemen such as buyer and seller agents, escrow agencies, banks, and title companies.

The launch of Bitcoin in 2009 marked a pivotal point for the world economy. However, this story also began with disappointment and one of the most important theft in its early tale. In 2014, when Bitcoin had just surpassed the $1 price, a group of hackers stole over $400 million or 700,000 BTC from crypto exchange Mt. Goxx and caused the platform to file for bankruptcy. Users were the most affected, most still waiting to receive compensation from the failed platform. The crypto industry has seen hundreds of hacks similar to Mt. Goxx, such as the Plus Token Scam which took millions in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other tokens from their crypto wallets. Most recently, crypto exchange AscendEX, formerly known as BitMax, was hacked and lost over $70 million from its users. Per the company&apos;s report, bad actors transferred the funds from the exchange&apos;s hot wallet which contained funds on Ethereum, Polygon, and Binance Smart Chain. The exchange has around one million clients, some of which are major institutions. Thus, choosing a trustworthy exchange remains one of the most important points for crypto adopters.
