Like its online namesake, the production will be funded by bitcoin.  The play  , entitled 'Silk Road’, sets the Dread Pirate Roberts (DPR) story in the north of England, and is reportedly based on writer Alex Oates' interviews with real-life website vendors.  It's a one-man play told through the eyes of DPR – who has still not been definitely identified – as he encounters both new online and economic realities, and the more traditional characters inhabiting them.  Funding  Producers are inviting bitcoin donations, but 'Silk Road' has also reportedly received funding from the Kevin Spacey Foundation, a charitable organisation started by the Hollywood actor that funds development of creative projects and provides scholarships to talented creatives in the UK and US.  'Silk Road’ the play invites audiences to:  ""Take an adrenaline-fuelled ride into Whitley Bay’s underworld. A tale of a struggling young Geordie tech-head, Bruce Blakemore, who gets caught up in a World Wide Web of new age pirates, local gangsters & innovative postal methods.""  A message on the official site says the production aims to raise 40 BTC through donations, by appealing to bitcoin users:    ""Writing the play, Alex was struck by the generous and highly intelligent nature of bitcoin owners and Silk Road users.      This play talks about issues of personal freedom and libertarian ideals that are close to the heart of many TOR and bitcoin users and in no way criticizes the use of such marketplaces.""    In reality  The 'real' Silk Road was an online marketplace accessible to users of the Tor network, which sold a collection of legal and illegal items and used bitcoin as its primary currency.  Shut down by the FBI in October, it has been both praised for demonstrating the advantages of bitcoin use and condemned for damaging the technology's reputation.  The man accused of being the mastermind behind Silk Road, Ross Ulbricht, awaits trial after his indictment for conspiracy to traffic narcotics, computer hacking and money laundering. His defence team has questioned whether any evidence exists to convict him, or whether it is even possible to launder a payment token that is not officially money.  Directed by Dominic Shaw and starring UK TV actor James Baxter in the lead and only role, 'Silk Road' will appear at the Assembly in Edinburgh during the Fringe festival. There will also be a preview in London at the New Diorama Theatre on 27th July.

With more than 1,100 attendees present at the Amsterdam Passenger Terminal, the conference was a prime learning, networking and brainstorming opportunity for bitcoin enthusiasts from around the world.  Day One  The conference kicked off on Friday 16th May, with a welcome note from Jon Matonis, executive director of Bitcoin Foundation followed by a keynote address from Overstock CEO, Patrick Byrne.  The Chief Scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation, Gavin Andresen also delivered his annual 'State of Bitcoin' address on the Friday. He warned that transactions fees could ""rise and rise to the point where only rich people can transact"" if block sizes aren’t increased.  The lighthearted Blockchain Awards – or the 'Blockies' – wrapped up the busy first day at the conference. Unsurprisingly, Satoshi Nakamoto won the top honour for visionary academic paper. Surprisingly, he was there to collect it.  Day Two  The second day kicked off with a presentation from Bobby Lee, CEO of BTC China, on the troubles the digital currency has faced in China.  Along the same themes was another discussion of the technical challenges bitcoin is set to face in the near future.  There was also a panel of seasoned bitcoin investors moderated by The New York Times' Nathaniel Popper. During the discussion, angel investor Roger Ver said that he was not actively looking to make any new investments, and was instead focusing on the ones already underway.  However, during both the days, the primary focus for most attendees was networking. With bitcoin enthusiasts from more than 50 countries present in one room, everyone was keen to meet others in the bitcoin space.  The organizers announced that Bitcoin2015 is set to take place in Asia next year.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TRADING,Roop Gill,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2014/05/20/video-roundup-bitcoin2014-in-amsterdam,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/922a17feed450fb56d14d71ac806f5bc823b3e88-1024x611.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377241,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX703Kz,1400621454,Renewed Optimism as Bitcoin Price Nears $500,"The price of bitcoin on the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) rose more than 10% today at its peak to a high of $494.16, up from the day's open of $444.31.  The price increase brought the value of bitcoin to its highest total since late April, nearly one month ago.  The price of bitcoin on the CoinDesk CNY BPI saw a similar spike, rising to a high of ¥3041.89, up from its opening at ¥2769.04.  At press time, prices on both the USD BPI and CNY BPI had cooled somewhat, with the price of bitcoin observed at $483.54 and ¥3010.13, a rise of roughly 8% on each index.  The first significant market movement in some time, the day's activity could be seen as yet another sign the price of bitcoin may be poised for a bull run, as some analysts have speculated.  Narrative reversal  The news follows a steady stream of positive press for the industry, including the successful Bitcoin2014 conference in Amsterdam.  That even saw major speakers such as Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire and Bitcoin Foundation chief scientist Gavin Andresen give high-profile talks that may have helped refocus the community on the larger implications of bitcoin and its potential impact on the global finance space.  Additionally, it comes on the heels of a string of major announcements — such as Circle's product debut, BitPay's $30m Series A funding round and positive comments from US government agencies.  China worries fade  A main driver of the decline in the price of bitcoin had been negative news from China, once one of the digital currency's largest markets.  However, in recent weeks, announcements from the country have been more positive, or at the very least, less negative.  For example, Beijing's Global Bitcoin Summit took place as scheduled, despite the absence of major exchanges, with the event ultimately serving to introduce the wider bitcoin community to the wide range of startups that have entered the market.

The artwork, 'Collaboration' by Reinier van den Bezemer Schoonderwoerdhttp://www.aaartnl.nl/kunstenaars/reinier-van-schoonderwoerd-den-bezemer, was purchased at a gallery in Amsterdam by a group of unnamed visitors during the annual bitcoin conference held last week, according to regional broadcaster Omroep West.  Van den Bezemer Schoonderwoerd told the media outlet that bitcoin is an alternative to the traditional banking system, which he says isn’t as trustworthy as a system built on digital currencies, adding:  ""Banks are, in fact, not to be trusted.""  In the interview, Van den Bezemer Schoonderwoerd compared the process of mining bitcoin to gold, and cited the decentralized nature of the technology as a strength compared to fiat currencies like the euro.  About the artist  According to art dealer and gallery operator AaartNL, Van den Bezemer Schoonderwoerd is known in Dutch art circles for both his painted and sculpted works.  Born in 1949, the artist is a member of the Leiden Center for Visual Art and has taken part in numerous artistic endeavors in and around the Netherlands during the past 20 years. His works show an interest in animals, nature and human interaction.  In the case of 'Collaboration', the piece focuses on the relationship between people and finance.  Art, luxury and bitcoin meet  The sale of the artwork represents another step for the budding presence of bitcoin in the art world. In the past year, the digital currency has come to play a small but noticeable role in the purchase and sale of creative works.  In February, WeCoin88 announced that it would cut prices for art transactions made in bitcoin. At the time, the company said that it believed bitcoin would come to play an important role for its quick and anonymous transaction capabilities.  Bitcoin’s place in the art world isn’t limited to high-end purchases, however.  Last year, royalty-free artwork website VectorToons announced that it would begin accepting bitcoin payments. Owner Brad Gosse told CoinDesk that bitcoin is a ""secure, legitimate currency"".

42377238,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX703HD,1400613906,Man Seeks $13 Million in Bitcoin from Feds for Wrongful Imprisonment,"A 28-year-old Arkansas man is invoicing the US government, payable in bitcoin.  Andrew Auernheimer of Fayetteville, Arkansas — known by his online handle 'weev', was convicted of computer fraud in 2012, although he has been set free on appeal. The invoice is a claim for compensation for an alleged case of wrongful imprisonment.  In a letter, described as 'an invoice for services rendered', Auernheimer writes:  ""I am owed 28,296 bitcoins. I do not accept United States dollars, as it is the preferred currency of criminal organizations such as the FBI, DOJ, ATF and Federal Reserve and I do not assist criminal racketeering enterprises.""  The exact figure of 28,296 BTC, Auernheimer says, is compensation for his time in captivity at 1 BTC per hour.  At a recent bitcoin price valuation, that would be worth over $13.7m.  AT&T hacking case  Auernheimer has been accused, along with a co-conspirator, of exploiting a flaw in AT&T's servers exposing more than 114,000 iPad user email addresses.  The vulnerability was then publicized by Gawker, causing a public relations issue for Apple.  In 2011, Auernheimer was arrested in Arkansas, and was then taken to New Jersey where he awaited trial. After his conviction on computer fraud charges, he spent 13 months at Allenwood Federal Correctional Complex in Pennsylvania.  The case against Auernheimer was turned over on appeal earlier this year, due to jurisdiction. Exposing the AT&T flaw, judges in the case ruled, was carried out by Auernheimer not in New Jersey, but in his home state of Arkansas.  He was set free on 11th April.    This is my invoice to the feds. Just sent it their way, bcc’d a few hundred journalists. http://t.co/CsC3Xi9Vsw pic.twitter.com/Er9bNRktiT      — Andrew Auernheimer (@rabite) May 20, 2014    Forthcoming lawsuit  Auernheimer's invoicing of the federal government in BTC is a creative way to publicize his plight, and there are indications that there will also be a civil lawsuit filed as well.  Even so, the US Attorney in New Jersey has made it known he may appeal the data breach case Auernheimer was involved in, reportedly to the Supreme Court.  In comments made to RT, Auernheimer expresses his view the government treated him unfairly:    “I want history to record that I made an honest and public attempt to get restitution for the violence the government committed against me.      Whatever I do next, I want people to know that I tried civil and peaceful resolution first.""    Notably, the US government does own enough bitcoin to pay the invoice, having seized it via criminal cases.  In January, a judge signed off on a forfeiture order for 29,655 bitcoins that were confiscated from the defunct online marketplace Silk Road.

The start-up behind the plan, ZaBitcoinATM, says it ordered a Lamassu machine in February, and that it expects to receive the unit within days.  ZaBitcoinATM revealed more details about the forthcoming launch in a Bitcoin Talk forum post, explaining:  ""We are in discussions with several restaurants/coffee shops and will be coming to a conclusion as to the final location once we have shown the interested parties the device.""  If all goes according to plan, Africa’s first bitcoin ATM will be in service by the end of the month.  Community feedback wanted  Johannesburg may seem like an obvious choice for the country’s first bitcoin ATM given its position as financial center, however, it may not have the only unit for long.  A second bitcoin ATM is reportedly on the way, and it’s coming to Cape Town.  ZaBitcoinATM has invited Cape Town’s bitcoiners to help choose the right spot for the unit via its Twitter account.    Our next Bitcoin ATM will land in Cape Town, soon. We are open to suggestions as to the most convenient place for our users?      — 1st African BTC ATM (@ZABitcoinATM) May 20, 2014    The deployment is a sign of increasing bitcoin interest in Africa, as a number of charities and companies are looking at potential applications for bitcoin in the region.  Additionally, many view the remittance market as the biggest opportunity in Africa.  In a recent interview with CoinDesk, Kipochi co-founder Pelle Braendgaard explained why he believes bitcoin could make inroads into developing countries. Further, the work of companies like Robocoin to turn its ATM network into a global remittance service suggests a similar approach could be attempted in Africa.  Africa's hurdles  However, bitcoin is not the only option for tech savvy Africans.  Since the continent still has a relatively low smartphone penetration rate, SMS money transfer services that can be used on practically any feature phone are quite popular.  As such, some firms are expanding their operations and integrating with other money transfer services. One such hybrid service is 37Coins, which plans to offer worldwide bitcoin wallet access via feature phones, using its SMS-based wallet.

42377230,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70379,1400607313,Bitcoin Regulation Roundup: Political Contributions and Troublesome Banks,"Regulatory attitudes toward digital currencies around the world are shifting. Hardly a day goes by without a central bank issuing a warning on the digital currency or new tax guidelines. However, it’s not all bad news – as some authorities are taking a far more positive approach.  In CoinDesk’s regulation roundup, Certified Public Accountant and ACFE Certified Fraud Examiner Jason Tyra examines the most significant digital currency news from the world’s regulators and law courts over the past two weeks.  China    Authorities' bitcoin squeeze continues    Chinese banks appear to have suspended relationships with all bitcoin-related businesses in the country, following “repeated directives” from the People’s Bank of China, the country's central bank.  In response, at least five bitcoin exchanges located in China withdrew from the Global Bitcoin Summit in Beijing: OKCoin, Huobi, BTC China, BtcTrade and CHBTC. Notably, BTC China CEO Bobby Lee recently won election to the Bitcoin Foundation’s Board of Directors as an industry representative.  Curiously, a report by the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission (an advisory body to the US Congress) cited Chinese regulatory action as a threat to bitcoin’s continued proliferation.  Though the attitude of the US government could be described, at best, as ambivalent, the report pointed out what most bitcoiners already knew: a friendly Chinese government may not be essential to bitcoin’s success, but a hostile Chinese government is far from helpful.  Japan    Japanese regulators announce increased oversight of bitcoin    Japan seems to have finally caught up with other developed nations with its announcement this week that it will crack down on unlawful commerce using bitcoin and other virtual currencies.  Furthermore, the Japanese government will classify bitcoin transactions as being similar to those generated by credit cards and will not seek to apply capital gains taxes to bitcoin transactions.  Japanese economic policy under Prime Minster Shinzo Abe, colloquially referred to as 'Abenomics', seeks to stimulate and grow the economy by, among other things, engineering a decline in the price of the yen relative to other currencies through massive quantitative easing (ie: inflation).  Japanese bitcoiners who intend to use bitcoin as a refuge from inflation may find solace in the Japanese government’s less-than-hostile treatment.  Switzerland    Bitcoin salaries may violate Swiss law    A study commissioned by the Swiss Federal Council has suggested that paying Swiss workers wholly or partially in bitcoin may be unlawful if such payment shifts exchange rate risk from the payer to the payee.  Speaking in response to the study, a representative of Bitcoin Association Switzerland stated that “startups will continue to do what makes sense to them”.  Bitcoin-related companies located in Switzerland, like others around the world, have considered paying wages and bonuses in bitcoin as a way to expand the bitcoin economy and conserve fiat currency reserves.  Although commissioned by the Federal Council, the study is not a legal finding in itself. Swiss law explicitly permits both payments in foreign currency and payment in kind.  United States    Political contributions in bitcoin get the green light    The US Federal Election Commission (FEC), the independent regulator that governs federal election policy and adjudicates electoral ethics issues, voted unanimously on 6th May to permit bitcoin donations to candidates in federal elections of up to $100 per donor, per election cycle. Candidates are currently limited to $2,600 in total donations per election.  Many US states incorporate FEC policy decisions by reference into their own bodies of election law. Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott previously announced that he would accept bitcoin donations in his bid for governor, as has US Representative Steve Stockman (Texas).  However, the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board forced a candidate to return a bitcoin donation as recently as 5th May. Whether that decision was reversed subsequent to the FEC ruling was unknown at press time.    Bitcoin industry reps detail banking setbacks at US hearing    BitPay’s Bryan Krohn, Xapo’s Karsten Behrend, CoinX’s Megan Burton, and SecondMarket’s Annemarie Tierney spoke before the Conference of State Bank Supervisors’ Emerging Payments Task Force on 16th May.  During a roughly two-hour hearing, the bitcoin industry representatives suggested that without clearer and more supportive regulatory standards, bitcoin companies will continue to struggle to build relationships with the banks and be held back in the broader consumer marketplace.  The task force, sponsored by a private organization of state-level banking officials, is considering whether and how digital currencies and other technological innovations in the financial sector will be impacted by current laws and whether recommendations for new laws or administrative regulations are necessary.

42377231,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7038P,1400605505,CERN Scientists Launch Encrypted Email Service With a Difference,"A team of developers from the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) has launched a new encrypted email service that could put an end to government snooping – with a little help from bitcoin.  The system, called ProtonMail, works by encrypting the data in the browser before it ever comes into contact with the server. So, even if someone gains complete access to the server, it won’t do them any good because ProtonMail does not store the encryption key.  Group effort  ProtonMail was conceived by PhD student Andy Yen, who called on fellow CERN scientists to examine the problem of online privacy, or rather the lack of it, and see if they could come up with a solution.  Yen took to CERN’s Facebook group and the response was overwhelming. Within days, dozens of people decided to join the effort and more than 40 individuals took part in the discussion. The team eventually came to include both CERN and MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) scientists, including four PhD physicists.  The core team of six started meeting at CERN’s Restaurant One and eventually they came up with ProtonMail.  “We’ve basically separated the message that’s encrypted apart from the key – all the encryption takes place on your computer instead of our servers, so there’s no way for us to see the original message,” Yen told Forbes.  He argues that ProtonMail differs from all other email systems, which store the key to decrypt messages.  NSA blowback?  Yen and his associates were prompted to develop the service following revelations made by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.  The Snowden leak proved what many technologists suspected for years – that the NSA was gaining access to commonly used technology to snoop on people – but many were taken aback by the sheer scale of the operation exposed by the whistleblower.  CERN scientists are not alone in their belief in the right to privacy. Many Internet users have started using encrypted communications in light of the Snowden affair.  According to Canadian broadband management company Sandvine, the volume of encrypted internet traffic has skyrocketed in recent months.  In its 'Global Internet Phenomena' report for the first half of 2014, the firm found that the percentage of encrypted Internet traffic in Europe had quadrupled in recent months. A similar trend has been observed in other parts of the world.  ProtonMail is looking to tap this relatively large pool of Internet goers who would like to keep their communications private. The system uses end-to-end encryption, but unlike many encryption tools it is designed to be intuitive and simple to use.  Bitcoin accepted  ProtonMail is currently in public beta and the team is working on Android and iOS apps. These should launch by the end of the summer, and if all goes according to plan, the service will move out of beta at around the same time.  It is still possible to sign up for an invite to participate in the beta testing, but server capacity is limited, Yen said, due to higher than anticipated demand.  Since the service is encrypted and, thus, cannot be used to serve targeted ads, such as Google AdSense, the team has decided to adopt a freemium model to make the service pay.  ProtonMail is free, but additional features and storage will be available. Full pricing tiers have not yet been announced, but the basic paid account will provide 1GB of storage for $5.  Since ProtonMail is all about security and privacy, it does not track its users or gather any personally identifiable information. Of course, an additional level of security and anonymity is provided by one of the payment methods – bitcoin.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/05/20/cern-scientists-launch-encrypted-email-service-with-a-difference,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/623fc309282be64363cc7499814fbe60956b5427-1000x745.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377244,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX703Q1,1400601323,'Cryptocurrency' Officially Added to Oxford Dictionary Online,"Oxford Dictionaries Online (ODO) has officially added the word 'cryptocurrency' to its database. The decision was made as part of a quarterly update this May that also included the words 'bikeable', 'snacky' and 'time suck'.  The announcement follows the August 2013 update that saw 'bitcoin' added to the respected resource. At the time, the ODO told CoinDesk that bitcoin was added due to its significant presence online and in the mainstream media.  The ODO's addition of 'cryptocurrency' indicates that the organisation views it as a recent term that has emerged to become ""significant or important"", and that it believes the word could become more widely used.  The ODO defines cryptocurrency as:  ""A digital currency in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank.""  Usage examples  The ODO further provided example sentences that, in part, aim to sum up the values of those who are interested in the industry and community.  The first sample sentence reads:  ""Decentralized cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin now provide an outlet for personal wealth that is beyond restriction and confiscation.""  Additional sentences describe how cryptocurrencies are valued based on supply and demand, and highlight that the total value of the market is more than $8bn.  Contemporary language  While notable to the bitcoin community, the ODO is notably the organisation's online-only resource on contemporary English that includes modern meanings of many traditional words.  As noted by Angus Stevenson, Head of Dictionary Projects at Oxford University Press in a 2013 interview with CoinDesk, inclusion in the ODO ""doesn't make any judgement on whether [the word] is good, bad, worthwhile or anything else"".  By comparison, the Oxford English Dictionary is more of a historical cannon that includes words and definitions that have stood the test of time.

China's bitcoin exchanges and mining equipment manufacturers usually grab the headlines in that part of the world. However, there are several startups breaking new ground in different parts of the digital currency ecosystem, and their focus is often on international markets as as much as China.  We spoke to three such companies at the recent Global Bitcoin Summit to find out about their ideas and how they plan to change the bitcoin landscape.  Jack Wang, Bitfoo/Bifubao  Bitfoo is the international name of secure wallet service Bifubao, which gained attention back in March as one of the first online bitcoin wallets to announce a cryptographic proof-of-reserves function. This allows users to verify that the company actually holds all bitcoins it claims to, while also keeping coins off-block chain.  Bitfoo's service also allows the creation of vanity addresses and the sending and receiving of bitcoins via email addresses.  Wang's background as a Chinese-American and former Silicon Valley lawyer gives him a perspective from both sides of the Pacific, and insights into market conditions in each country.  Liang Qiu and Wei Lu, Peatio  Peatio  has developed open-source bitcoin exchange software that anyone in the world can tailor and develop to their own needs – all via an API that allows trading in any currency or language.  The two developers, Qiu and Lu, said Peatio was funded by Bitfund.pe, a bitcoin private investment company owned by China's largest bitcoin holder (and Beijing summit president) Li Xiaolai.  Lu said the project, which lives on GitHub, already has over 200 starts and more than 50 forks.  Liang Qiu's answers are in Chinese, translations by Wei Lu.  Hanson Hong, BitOcean  BitOcean  is developing a new bitcoin ATM in partnership with Chinese exchange OKCoin, and already has a number of orders from around the world.  Its demonstration machines were one of the most popular items at the summit, with users able to feed in Chinese yuan and purchase bitcoins on the spot.  Hong, BitOcean's co-founder and CMO, said the machines can be two-way, allowing users to both buy and sell, and that BitOcean is working on implementing financial compliance measures for different jurisdictions.

42395327,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASaLdR,1400593091,Could This Holy Bitcoin Trinity Revive Colored Coins?,"A new wallet, Coinprism, launched this week – heralding a broader development that advocates say could revive a key application of bitcoin's technology.  Coinprism, designed to let users trade anything on the bitcoin network, supports a concept called 'colored coins' which aims to build on the already exciting bitcoin universe.  Bitcoins are useful, but like dollars or euros they are only used as currency. Colored coins look to change this by using bitcoins to represent other things. ‘Coloring’ a bitcoin means attaching a piece of information to it, which turns it into a token for something else.  For example, what if transactions in the bitcoin block chain could be used to represent, say, company stock, gold or a deed to a building? Then, someone could issue shares on the bitcoin network, or trade commodities on it.  This would give bitcoins a huge advantage over traditional ways of sending assets. If you want to send gold, company stock, or the physical deeds to a house today, this necessitates a complicated process involving notaries, registered deliveries and paper trails.  Bitcoin’s cryptographic technology has all that built in – you can know that a particular bitcoin came from a particular address and went to another one – and it can happen in just a few minutes.  If bitcoins could represent other assets, then the rights to those assets could be sent quickly and easily, anywhere in the world.  Wallets, exchanges and interoperability  Of course, there are three important components colored coins need in order to be used for asset transfer.  Wallets have to understand how to assign and read the extra information, everyone needs to agree on what a particular ‘color’ means and how it is stored in a bitcoin, and finally, exchanges are needed so that these assets can be traded.  Yesterday, Irish firm Pixode launched Coinprism. Pixode – the same firm behind predictions site Predictious – created its own protocol for storing colored coins on the bitcoin block chain, called Open Assets.  Coinprism is a web-based wallet implementation of the protocol, explains its founder, Flavien Charlon.  But, colored coins have long been a holy grail in the bitcoin world, and this isn’t the first project to try to implement them. That was ChromaWallet, aka ngcccbase. It is a desktop wallet offering colored coins capabilities, said Alex Mizrahi, who is behind the wallet:  ""It will give users an ability to issue their own colored coins, work with colored coins issued by others, and has built-in exchange functionality.""  However, he added that it still needs some work, and is not yet suitable for end users.  The ability to work with other peoples' colored coins and run an exchange is important. It's part of a collaboration with another group, formerly BitcoinX, which has since morphed into ColoredCoins.org.  That group is led by another advocate, Amos Meiri. This team is developing a standard and a P2P network for colored coins, which Meiri hopes to publish within a month. He said that it will describe the various types of assets that can be exchanged with colored coins.  The third part of this puzzle is Iridis, a new initiative for creating a peer-to-peer decentralized exchange based on colored coins, which has been created by the same people behind ColoredCoins. Iridis is organized by Oren Gample.  ""We want to provide the users a way to trade assets, so we'll probably plug into Iridis,"" Charlon says.  The problem is that Iridis is still in its very early stages, and ChromaWallet is also not ready for commercial use.  📷  ""I think the competition we are seeing at the moment is healthy, however there is very little interoperability between those projects,"" admits Charlon, who says that the market is at an early stage.  Having said that, many of the people working on these projects seem to be advising each other’s projects, and the community appears relatively tight-knit.  ""Open Assets will work with Iridis, and should be usable from ChromaWallet as well,"" Charlon concludes. ""Open Assets itself is an open specification so it is easy to build something that can interoperate with it.""  That would enable all of these systems to encode colored coins on the bitcoin blockchain in the same way.  At the end of the day, Coinprism wallet users will be able to exchange assets with ChromaWallet and with Iridis' wallet, he continued. “There is still some work to be done to get to that compatibility, but that's the goal.”  Bitcoin core developer Mike Hearn, who is also instrumental in the development of Java wallet library bitcoinJ, argues that these standards and interoperability issues will be thrashed out over time, suggesting that:  “Having some other guys go off and figure out standards and build wallets seems like the right way to go. Longer term, their work can always be ‘blessed’ by the wider community if it's good.""  Yoni Johnathan Assia, a member of the colored coins team, tells CoinDesk:  “We support all efforts towards bitcoin 2.0 technology, and believe there will be multiple protocols that will also work together.""  Perhaps one of the biggest challenges facing colored coins as a concept is that it’s just that. The current lack of interoperability and the slow pace of ChromaWallet development means that it is in danger of being surpassed by newer projects with a broader scope.  New frameworks and self-declared next-generation cryptocurrencies threaten to leapfrog this narrowly-defined concept of blockchain-based smart property. They offer a range of features, some of which overlap with each other. The smart property concept offered by colored coins is generally a subset of these.  Meni Rosenfeld, a bitcoin advocate who has been advising Meiri's team, defines them as distinct from the colored coins effort, saying:  ""In my view what characterizes pure colored coins projects are that they can be put on top of bitcoin, and bitcoins are all that is required to use them.""  All-in-one solution  One of the alternatives is Counterparty, another decentralized exchange facilitating smart property transactions.  Counterparty, which has its own wallet called Counterwallet, does use multi-signature transactions on the bitcoin block chain to describe transactions. But, it doesn’t use bitcoins themselves for transactions. In fact, it created more than 2.6 million units of its own currency, XCP, which participants accrue by 'burning' their own bitcoins, rendering them unusable. Instead, assets are created by users.  Counterparty is also far more than a simple block chain-based colored coins system, argues spokesperson Matt Young.  ""Users can create a smart property that has as few or as many units as they like,"" says Young, who adds that he sees applications in personal branding, user acquisition, and user retention.  He adds:  Leverage can be employed to further increase exposure. Binary betting and contracts for difference within Counterparty are peer-to-peer and require no trusted third party.""  The ability to describe assets using the bitcoin block chain is therefore part of a far bigger picture for Counterparty. One advantage that Counterparty has over Iridis is that it has been out there doing this for a while. Users typically won't care about what happens under the hood, as long as something works.  No wonder Meiri sees them as competition. ""Counterparty are really professional guys,"" he says.  There are several other ventures that offer a variation of coin coloring – or at least the potential for it – but he doesn’t view these as competition. ""Others are not on the bitcoin blockchain so they are more competitors for bitcoin,"" he suggests.  Beyond colored coins  Who are these others? The Ethereum framework, still in stealth mode, aims to offer a complete platform on which to build various cryptocurrency applications. Vitalik Buterin, who was originally working with Meiri’s team, left to develop that concept.  📷  Ripple is a different beast altogether, constituting a trading network and currency that has the ability to describe any type of virtual asset.  Bitshares is another venture that uses cryptocurrency units as asset classes. And Mastercoin relies on the bitcoin blockchain, but is a 'metacoin', which uses the blockchain for its own currency. That project recently launched smart property functionality.  Then there’s NXT, another entirely different cryptocurrency, which has now launched the NXT asset exchange.  “The NXT asset exchange allows decentralized trading for almost any currency for almost any commodity. It’s not an afterthought; it’s developed right into the NXT core,” says John Manglaviti, a spokesperson for NXT.  “The asset exchange is just the first step; we’re developing other key technologies such as the decentralized digital goods store, instant transactions, automated transactions and a turing complete solution.""  Still in the wings is the burgeoning side chain movement, which could offer all kinds of chains designed for alternative assets.  Challenges remain  Many of these ideas overlap in the problems that they try to solve, expanding the concept of cryptocurrency to represent other assets, and offering innovative ways of exchanging them.  Many of them will face the same challenge: how do participants in these trading schemes get others to honour these digital assets, and redeem them for the assets that they represent? If person A issues person B a colored coin transaction that says it entitles person A to an ounce of gold, then how is that legally enforceable?  You’d need a third-party depository of some sort that agreed to honour a colored coin transaction, says Charlon. But with interoperability and mindshare so fragmented in an early stage market, how is that going to happen?  Meiri hopes that having trusted, asset-backed issuers will solve that problem. He explains:  ""We are separating the assets in to two different classes: 1) untrusted issuers (you and me issuing assets). 2) Trusteed issuers, such as banks, trusts etc.”  These trusted assets will be backed either by real holdings, or by open hedge accounts, which the issuers can show to prove that they have the holdings. It remains to be seen how many of them will step up.  “It’s true that there are very few companies that act as a gateway,” Charon says, adding that he is in discussion with a bullion storage company in Singapore. “They want to be able to allow people to withdraw their ounces of gold in the form of a colored coin.”  Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of Ethereum, says that broader enforcement of property titles based on colored coin technology will be challenging, saying:  “There is no framework within the block chain or automation to enforce such rights. With Ethereum we are planning on exploring smart contracts connected to property that use Unidroit.""  Unidroit is an intergovernmental organisation developing uniform law instruments to harmonise law between different states.  As of today, there are at least a few places where you can download wallets, access decentralized exchanges, and begin to use cryptographic currency technologies to represent other assets. That’s a lot further ahead than we were six months ago.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/05/20/could-this-holy-bitcoin-trinity-revive-colored-coins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e5515867a9f2b589efc3a1fba6088e5a160fd063-2876x1600.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42395331,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASaLjL,1400589357,37Coins Plans Worldwide Bitcoin Access With SMS-Based Wallet,"Startup 37Coins has created a universal bitcoin wallet that can be used on any cellphone, aiming to provide people around the globe with better access to financial resources.  The service allows consumers to pay in bitcoin from any mobile device with SMS functionality via a 'gateway' in the user's country of origin.  This means that the benefits of the digital currency can be accessible to people who arguably stand to benefit the most, like those in poorer regions of the developing world and areas without advanced communications infrastructure.  As Jonathan Zobro, one of the company's founders, explained:  ""We can give tools to people to help bring bitcoin’s benefits to their economy.""  How it works  For each country, 37Coins plans to establish a gateway for its service.  A gateway is a private operator who allows an Android device to be used as a conduit for transactions via its local number and Internet connection. Gateways are rewarded with small transaction fees in bitcoin for providing the service.  Anyone wanting a 37Coins wallet can set one up at the company's website, but, for people lacking web access and/or smartphone, a hosted wallet is automatically created once a small amount of bitcoin is sent to their cellphone number.  The service acts virally and once, say, Alice has bitcoin in her new wallet, she can send funds on to Bob – thus creating a wallet for him, and so on.  The 37Coins system is operated at the user end via a series of inputted commands. By texting 'Bal' to the gateway number, a user can find out their balance, while 'Addr' requests their bitcoin wallet address, and so on.  To send value, the user texts an amount in either a fiat currency or bitcoin, along with the receiver's phone number. The gateway will then ask for confirmation via a code before executing the transfer.  For security, users can opt to set up two-factor authentication. Once initiated and a PIN recorded, the system will then call the user to confirm each transaction.  Simplifying bitcoin payments  Johann Barbie, a German-born engineer and the co-founder of 37Coins, has been working on the SMS-payment concept since last autumn.  The idea arose, Barbie said, through his desire to be able to send people bitcoin without the complication of manually setting up wallets and buying bitcoin:  ""I wanted to find an easy way to send bitcoin, force bitcoin on them.""  Automating the creation of wallets seemed by far the best way to introduce people to digital currencies. Initially, Barbie tried an email-based system, but soon decided that SMS was even more ubiquitous, something everyone can use:  ""I had difficulties always explaining bitcoin. And you want people to set up a wallet so they don’t forget about it.""  Barbie then asked Zobro and Songyi Lee, who has a background in social work, to join him in the creation of 37Coins. The company is now based at the Plug and Play Technology Center in Sunnyvale, California, which is incubating 37Coins as part of its group of bitcoin startups.  Cellphone penetration  The reason 37Coins sees SMS as the best way to reach the most people, is that almost everyone now has access to a cellphone. According to the International Telecommunications Union, cellphone penetration will reach 95.5% globally by the end of 2014 – far higher than the roughly 40% of people using the Internet globally.  There are already mobile network-based digital currency platforms. In Africa, payments platform M-PESA is being used by a major cellphone operator to ease payments in countries such as Kenya.  Yet, 37Coins' system has the potential for a wider, more global reach.  ""Having this technology figured out in a number of countries is [our] competitive advantage,"" said Barbie. ""It’s not as easy to do as delivering an app through the Internet [but] I think it can be very useful [for adoption].""  The challenges  37Coins will need to rely on the trust and ability of third-parties in order to make its business a success. ""We can provide this technology itself, that’s fine. But we cannot solve all of the other problems,"" said Songyi Lee.  There is potential in Africa for 37Coins, she added, but very little in terms of infrastruture exists today:  ""There is a long way to go [in Africa] because they don’t have the liquidity. They don’t have exchanges there.""  In order for 37Coins to work as a conduit for bitcoin, there need to be onramps: gateways, exchanges and point-of-sale systems.  That's why the company is developing key partnerships, starting with Asia. In Singapore, 37Coins is working with locally-based Coinpip in order to get its service off the ground in that country.  Furthermore, the company recently made a trip to Manila, Philippines, with the aim of working with a local operator there.  Li says that 37Coins is an ideal service for the Phillipines – it lacks an adequate Internet network and people are dispersed across the nation's thousands of islands. However, almost everyone owns a cellphone.  The SMS market  Other companies like Coinbase offer SMS bitcoin wallets, but while some do offer this as an additional service, 37Coins is focused solely on SMS. That might give that startup an advantage.  In fact, the company is banking on it. 37Coins plans to make money as a 'white label' solution for regional operators: offering use of the SMS-based wallet system in return for a cut of transaction or exchange fees from the operator end.  However, the founders of 37Coins know it will have to spend money helping operators market this. Said Zobro:  ""We’re going to have to make promotional materials, especially if they are only using an SMS phone. We’re going to have to make little cards for them for shorthand.""  Banking on bitcoin  M-PESA in Kenya is an example of the growth of digital currencies in different markets. Plus there is the growing number of altcoins to consider as well, that might eventually come to compete in the space.  Despite this possibility, the 37Coins team remains confident that it is bitcoin that will continue to be utilized as a global store of value.  This is especially for those who do not have access to a bank, they think. The appeal of plugging into bitcoin's international community with 37Coins' SMS wallet system could generate a lot of interest from local operators.  ""[Bitcoin] is the one with the most development, the most developed ecosystem and network. Maybe in the future, if something takes over, it would be pretty easy to switch over. But right now the best one is bitcoin,"" said Zobro.  No matter what happens in the digital currencies market, 37Coins aims to be a part of it.  According to its website, 37Coins' gateways are already operating in a handful of countries including Germany, Japan and the Philippines, and they are currently recruiting for more.

42377240,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX703Jj,1400580681,Thai Bitcoin Exchange Reopens with Enhanced Services,"Thailand based bitcoin exchange Bitcoin.co.th has relaunched as a full exchange after months spent offline and in testing, with a focus on security and ease of use, according to its founders.  That Thailand has open exchanges at all is significant, given the country's ongoing reputation in some media as a bitcoin-unfriendly jurisdiction. Bitcoin.co.th went offline in July last year after the Bank of Thailand supposedly indicated that bitcoin was not legal.  The central bank then suggested in March that bitcoin was risky but not necessarily illegal in the country, opening the door to legitimate bitcoin businesses.  Bitcoin.co.th  has spent most of the past month conducting extensive public alpha testing, awarding 1 BTC to successful bug-spotters. The exchange is still listed as being in beta mode, but this is mainly an initial precaution and the exchange is fully functional.  Notably, the exchange also interacts with Thailand-based banks accounts, allowing users to deposit and withdraw using the local currency, the baht.  Digital currency trades are available too, allowing exchanges between bitcoin and eight selected altcoins, including litecoin, dogecoin, peercoin, feathercoin and zetacoin.  Self-sufficient company  Managing Director David Barnes said the company had existed for almost a year, yet spent a significant part of 2013 selling mining equipment to stay afloat while its exchange function remained closed due to the legal uncertainty, adding:  ""I think we've shown that we have staying power and have built our business and brand with no VC or outside investment.""  Bitcoin.co.th provides a dual Thai and English language interface. The fact that several on its management team are foreign-born suggests the local bitcoin economy is driven in part by expat efforts, although local business people are becoming interested as they discover the advantages of the company's bitcoin exchange services.  ""Thai language customer support and web content is where our main focus of improvement will be in the coming months,"" Barnes said, explaining:  ""Sometimes there can be a gap between foreign management and Thai customers. We're hoping to bridge this gap by continuing to bring in more Thai staff and management as we expand and provide our users with the best of both worlds.""  The exchange, along with its banking-related services, is restricted to Thailand customers only. The company is not trying to compete with large international exchanges, Barnes said, but aims mainly to provide a convenient service within the country.  Security and compliance  Bitcoin.co.th promises such security measures as two-factor authentication, full disk encryption on wallet servers with no incoming outside connections allowed, code developed fully in-house and no direct access by the front-end to the wallet servers.  All withdrawals are manually checked before being processed, and new users must have accounts verified before trading.  For transparency, the exchange publishes a list of all addresses with unspent inputs so they can be checked with a service such as Blockchain.  The site also publishes a full order book and detailed charts to show market depth and volumes. At the time of writing, 1 BTC was worth 15,017 THB ($462).

42377235,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX703DR,1400567908,Wallet Extension KryptoKit Disappears from Chrome Browsers,"UPDATE (21st May, 10:49 GMT): A Chrome product manager has provided more information on the reasons behind the outage. More details here.    UPDATE (20th May, 9:30 GMT): Co-founder Steve Dakh says Google has now responded and reinstated KryptoKit's account, meaning users should now be able to access their wallets again. Still no detailed reason has been given for the removals.      KryptoKit, the bitcoin wallet and encrypted messaging extension for Chrome browsers, was today mysteriously auto-removing itself from users' computers – along with easy access to the bitcoins they kept there.  Developers from the KryptoKit project were frantically working to find the reason and a solution, and it was not known for sure whether all users would be able to regain access to their funds. The extension stores a private key seed locally on each machine, though some level of technical knowledge is required to find it.  Some users reported success with shutting down Chrome, disconnecting from the Internet and then restarting it. From there, either before or after reconnecting to the Internet, the reappeared extension may be able to create a backup file or export the 'brainwallet' private key generator.  Sudden removal  Around 6:00am GMT users began to flood twitter and reddit with messages saying a popup dialog box had informed them the extension had automatically removed itself from Chrome. Two buttons on the dialog said 'OK' and 'Details' – the latter of which took them to Google's Chrome web store, from where they found KryptoKit had also disappeared.    my #KryptoKit #bitcoin wallet was just automatically removed from the chrome browser. wtf? @KryptoKit      – Assaf Shomer (@BeatTorrent) 20th May 2014    Six month-old Kryptokit had support from some prominent members of the bitcoin community and had been well received by users until today. It even had a partnership with BitPay to include a 'two-click' solution for easy payment to bitcoin-accepting merchants.  Finding a solution  Within the hour, project backer Vitalik Buterin posted on reddit that Google had removed the extension ""for unspecified TOS [terms of service] violations"", and that KryptoKit co-founder Steve Dakh had ""been stonewalled"" when asking Google for a clarification.  ""If you made a backup, then you should have your brainwallet seed in the backup file, which you can import into blockchain.info or simply pass through sha256 to get your private key out,"" Buterin wrote, adding:  ""If you did not make a backup, things are a bit more complicated.""  He then posted some command line directions for Windows and Linux users to help locate the brainwallet – a 50-character string in a directory containing Chrome's user data. This can then be imported into blockchain.info or converted to a private key.  Big move  Whatever the reason, if Google is responsible for the removal it seems to be an aggressive move. Users were presented with no choice as to whether or not to remove software they had installed on their personal machines; software that also held access to their funds. Such a sudden removal would usually be reserved for dangerous malware.  Unlike fellow tech giant Apple, Google has so far not shown any opposition to bitcoin or its use on devices running its software. There have been no reports of other bitcoin wallets, including those installed on Android-powered mobile devices, being removed.  History  KryptoKit  launched in December 2013, promising a simple and easy accessible wallet with no logins and passwords, that could also send encrypted messages. One useful feature was its ability to identify bitcoin addresses on a webpage, allowing a user to select from a drop-down menu instead of copy-pasting or scanning a QR code.  The extension is the product of developers associated with the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada, including co-founders Dakh and Anthony di Iorio. Launched in December 2013, a month later it received backing from high-profile bitcoin figures Buterin, Roger Ver and Erik Voorhees.  CoinDesk will continue to monitor this developing story.
