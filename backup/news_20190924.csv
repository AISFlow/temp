As of 21:50, BTC was trading around $8,600, down from a high of $9,812 over the previous 24 hours.  “Even for bitcoin, this is a pretty rare event,” said Qiao Wang, director of product at Messari, a New York-based cryptocurrency-focused data and research firm.  The price started to plunge around 18:30 UTC and stabilized around 19:00.  A trader, who wished to remain anonymous, said the price drop may have been exacerbated by margin calls and contract liquidations on Bitmex, a Seychelles-based exchange that provides customers with 100x leverage, essentially loans to traders that multiply the size of an investment by 100 times.  The margin calls were noted by DataMish, a data platform. We contacted Bitmex for comment but were unable to reach a representative at press time.  BitMex Margin Call Data via DataMish.    The long squeeze    A long squeeze, the opposite to a short squeeze, is a situation in which investors who hold long positions feel the need to sell into a falling market to cut their losses.

42382735,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sjul,1569358853,US House Passes Bill for FinCEN to Study Blockchain Use,"Congress wants the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) to up its internal blockchain game with a new bill to study how the technology could be adapted for law enforcement.  On Sept. 19, the House of Representatives passed legislation calling for the financial crimes regulator to study its use of “innovative technologies” — including blockchain. The bill now moves to the Senate for consideration.  The “Advancing Innovation to Assist Law Enforcement Act” mandates that FinCEN’s director consider how blockchain and other tech advances can improve the bureau’s operations.  “The Director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) shall carry out a study on… whether AI, digital identity technologies, blockchain technologies, and other innovative technologies can be further leveraged to make FinCEN’s data analysis more efficient and effective,” the bill reads.  Freshman Representative Anthony Gonzalez (R) Ohio, a member of the House Financial Services Committee, introduced the bill in May as a high-tech means to fight financial crimes.  “My bill makes sure that we are using the best technology we have available to find and stop the money laundering that makes all these crimes not only possible, but financially profitable for cartels, traffickers, and terrorists,” Gonzalez said.  Gonzalez’ act pushes FinCEN towards a technology whose best-known manifestation — cryptocurrencies — have largely been its to regulate. The Treasury department bureau’s interpretive guides and letters on matters from AML compliance to ICO rules inform industry players. If signed into law, FinCEN may have to jump in.  Gerard Daché, executive director at the Government Blockchain Association, which promotes blockchain technology solutions to government, called the advance long overdue.  The government often plays catch-up to ""bad guys"" and their blockchain tools, Daché said, wasting time, energy and money on antiquated techniques while the enemy races ahead.  ""It's almost like an ostrich sticking its head in the sand"" said Daché. Government bureaus such as FinCEN need to study how these tools are being used and then integrate them into their own arsenal, he said.

According to a court order dated Tuesday, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court has stayed a previous ruling by New York Supreme Court Judge Joel Cohen. Cohen ruled in August that Tether and its affiliated entities must produce documents about a $900 million loan to Bitfinex, the exchange that Tether shares leadership and shareholders with.  According to the order, which listed appellate court justices David Friedman, Peter Tom, Troy Webber, Ellen Gesmer and Jeffrey Oing, the respondents moved to stay an order to turn over documents about the loan.  The judges wrote:  ""It is ordered that the motion is granted on condition the appeal is perfected on or before November 4, 2019 for the January 2020 Term.""  The appeal will likely be fully briefed by sometime in December, with arguments not occurring before next year.  Bitfinex, its parent company iFinex, its sister firm Tether and other affiliated entities are fighting the New York Attorney General's office, which alleged in April that the exchange covered up the loss of $850 million held by a payment processor by borrowing from Tether's stablecoin reserves.  The New York regulator asked Bitfinex to turn over a number of documents pertaining to this alleged cover-up, which included a number of loans that Tether provided to Bitfinex to help the exchange process customer withdrawals and other transactions.  Judge Cohen ruled last month that Bitfinex must turn over the documents, saying the NYAG's office had jurisdiction over the exchange and the document production should proceed.  Attorneys for Bitfinex immediately appealed the decision.  In a statement Tuesday, Stuart Hoegner, general counsel to Bitfinex and Tether, said ""We are gratified by the panel's decision and we look forward to addressing the substantive issues before the appellate court.""  After this article was published, an NYAG spokesperson told CoinDesk that, ""The injunction that prohibits the movement of money between Tether and Bitfinex is still in place, that has not changed. We look forward to making our case in court as we seek to have Judge Cohen’s decision upheld and continue our investigation.""

According to a public filing published Tuesday, the SEC has begun evaluating the proposed rule change to allow NYSE Arca to list and trade shares of Wilshire Phoenix's Bitcoin and Treasury Investment Trust. The companies first filed the rule change proposal in May.  The ETF would give investors exposure to both bitcoin and U.S. Treasury bonds. The SEC listed a number of questions for the general public, including what individuals think of the suggestion that the CME bitcoin reference rate is not susceptible to manipulation.  The SEC began taking comments on the proposal in June, and records show that only six individuals have submitted responses, both in support of and against allowing a bitcoin ETF.  (One comment appears exasperated with the process, with an anonymous submitter writing only, ""FOR GOD SAKE just approve this bitcoin etf --- THIS IS BEEN GOING ON FOREVER..."")  According to another public filing, Wilshire Phoenix executives, NYSE Arca employees and members of the Seward & Kissel law firm met with SEC staffers earlier in September.  Upcoming deadlines  The SEC faces a final deadline to approve or disapprove a bitcoin ETF proposed by Bitwise Asset Management in the middle of October.  The company has filed a number of reports with the SEC in an effort to convince the regulator that the bitcoin market is mature enough to support such a product. It remains unclear whether the regulators are convinced of this fact, however. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton recently said that, while the bitcoin market has made steps to mature, there is still “work to be done” before a bitcoin ETF can be approved.  VanEck and SolidX, which also faced a mid-October deadline, pulled their joint bitcoin ETF proposal earlier this month. VanEck Director of Digital Asset Strategies Gabor Gurbacs later said that bringing such a product ""remains a top priority,"" though he did not indicate if the companies would file the ETF proposal for a third time (the proposal was previously withdrawn during the prolonged government shutdown at the beginning of 2018).  Regarding the Wilshire Phoenix proposal, the SEC has a legally mandated 180 days from the date the filing was first published in the Federal Register to make a decision. The 180-day countdown began July 1, which gives the Commission until Dec 28, 2019, to make a decision.  Correction (Sept. 25, 17:10 UTC): The SEC has 180 days from the date the filing was originally published in the Federal Register to decide on the Wilshire Phoenix bitcoin ETF proposal, not 35 days from now, as was previously reported. Once the 180 days have passed, the SEC can extend the deadline for up to an additional 60 days, according to a Wilshire Phoenix representative.

42382726,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sjjR,1569337209,This Dapp Shows How Blockstack and Ethereum Are Different,"The Blockstack file-sharing dapp Envelop, which works a little like WeTransfer but with encrypted storage via the blockchain platform, just launched a browser extension for Chrome, Firefox and Opera.  Now desktop Blockstack users can simply upload files to the extension and drop them in emails or direct messages even if the file is normally too big.  “With Blockstack, there’s the knowledge of where your files are stored at any given time,” Envelop co-founder Sérgio David dos Santos told CoinDesk.  He added that users can’t lose access to the file, stored via Blockstack’s distributed system, plus no one can share or access the file without the owner’s knowledge, including Blockstack itself.  Dos Santos said the web app has attracted 1,000 users since launching in June 2019, which puts it on par with most ethereum-based dapps outside of the gambling and financial services sectors.  But while ethereum companies generally viewed each app as an independent product, groups building on the Blockstack platform have gone a different route.  To date, Blockstack has raised roughly $75 million through a combination of venture capital and several token sales from 2017 to 2019, first to accredited investors then following the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s Reg A+ crowdfunding exemption.  The company then set aside a pool of funds that could be distributed to projects when they attract users. Blockstack CEO Muneeb Ali told CoinDesk the App Mining incentives program has paid $900,000 worth of bitcoin to more than a dozen projects since it started in November 2018.  The distributions are modest. Envelop, for example, has only received $3,784 from the program since June, according to Dos Santos. For comparison, Dmail, an encrypted email service built on Blockstack, earned $63,000 by August 2019.  For many Blockstack projects, those small figures are not problematic. Envelop, for example, is a side project of web development firm Bloco, itself a mom-and-pop consulting firm run by Sérgio David and wife Claudia dos Santos.  Like Dmail and many other Blockstack projects, these are established companies that aren’t looking to monetize their side projects, or raise venture capital for them, in the near future.  “The good thing about the app mining program is it gives you a way to bootstrap, to test the waters,” Sérgio David dos Santos said, adding:  “The community is still figuring out what are the best business models to build on top of decentralized applications. It’s tough to switch your mindset from normal business models to models that are more ethical.""  If creators don’t want to collect user data or sell storage options, however, the question remains: How to capture value from the software they’ve built and maintained?  “If we make our project open-source, if we let you take care of the storage itself, what else do we have to offer?” he asked. “We’re working through a few options.”  It also remains to be seen how valuable the App Mining program’s support will be when the program switches in November from paying in bitcoin to Blockstack’s native token, STX. Blockstack CEO Ali said if an exchange listing of STX were to occur, it would take place on an international exchange that would only serve non-U.S. individuals. He said the listing would likely happen in October 2019, though possibly later.  “Our plans for completely switching out bitcoin [for STX] might change as we’re actively tweaking and improving the App Mining program during the pilot phase,” Ali added.  In the meantime, the Envelop team is focused on gaining users, beyond crypto circles, and learning about their needs.  “In the long run, we’re looking to develop an iOS app and also a Mac [desktop] application,” David dos Santos said. “We’re still feeling things out.”  Claudia and Sérgio David dos Santos image via Bloco",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MINING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/09/24/this-dapp-shows-how-blockstack-and-ethereum-are-different,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/454009b1b56dbebee40311aa15d20bfe0ff36bc4-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Securitize announced in a press release Tuesday that the funding – an extension of its Series A round – was backed by Santander InnoVentures, MUFG Innovation Partners and Nomura Holdings. Also participating this time round were existing investors of the Series A, Blockchain Capital, SPiCE VC, and SeedRocket4Founders.  The firm plans to use the cash injection to carry on developing its technology platform with the grand aim of ""modernizing the legacy securities industry.""  The $14 million investment brings Securitize's total funding to date to over $30 million, according to its own figures.  Carlos Domingo, co-founder and CEO of Securitize, said in the announcement:  ""Bringing on key strategic investors like Santander InnoVentures, MUFG, and Nomura, as well as leading blockchain investors, validates how transformative digital securities are for traditional financial markets. Their investment in Securitize ensures that we can continue to drive adoption and innovation with our execution and industry-leading technology.""

It further claims to have the ""highest adoption rate in the industry,"" having issued 11 digital securities already with ""dozens"" more on the way.

42382736,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sjw1,1569330012,GrainChain's Smart Contracts Unite Honduras Coffee Business,"Agro-focused blockchain platform GrainChain has brokered deals across the Honduran coffee supply chain to track the production and trade of beans over its smart contract system.  The launch, announced today, is starting with a 2 percent sliver of Honduras’ 7-million-bag-a-year export industry – equivalent to “10-15 percent of the organic fair trade market,” says GrainChain CEO Luis Macias, who hopes to expand its reach.  GrainChain’s rollout in Honduras comes as players in both coffee and tech embrace blockchain to tame the global market. In May, Starbucks announced that it would track its global coffee supply chain on Microsoft’s Azure blockchain for the benefit of consumers who want to follow the bean from plantation to coffee pot.  While tasting notes and sourcing information headline Starbucks’ mobile app – GrainChain’s smart-contract-based ecosystem targets the on-the-ground financing of coffee production.  GrainChain’s platform connects the Honduran farmers growing the beans with the exporters shipping them to roasters around the world.  “This is the first solution that we see that allows banks, insurers, vendors, cooperatives, exporters and farmers to be all on one platform,” Francisco Fortin, a representative for participating loan guarantor Confianza Hondura, told CoinDesk.  “We feel that this will encourage trust among the supply chain.”  Engaging the Ecosystem  CEO Macias first pitched his “top-down approach” to Honduras' financial institutions: banks, whose capital the farmers need to fund their seasonal industry.  “They wanted to find a solution on how to loan their farmers money, but even if the banks guaranteed the loans, they were still having trouble figuring out how to do it,” Macias said.  Macias had already tested GrainChain’s bean-to-buyer tracking system on farms in Texas, where the company is based, and Mexico, and both examples were presented as models to the banks. They latched on almost immediately.  Farmers were on board with the project. GrainChain’s launch participants include fair trade and organic specialty coffee producers, Macias said — “people who are trying to make a difference in the social aspect of creating coffee.”  The farmers were excited to build for stronger trust with the banks. It represented a new wave of capital from banks more willing to loan.  “Having technological support and money changes many things,” German Delcid, a farmer with the participating Santa Rosa de Copan farm, said. “I feel that with access to financing and security of payment will have great effect on our farms.”  GrainChain’s biggest struggle came from the exporters and buyers, who Macias said did not immediately understand the benefits a smart contracts system might have to their supply chain.  But after seeing the tech’s potential cost savings – cutting out middlemen, securing and paying off loans, reducing administrative overhead – they, too, signed on.  Exporters additionally saw the opportunity to use the tech for additional profit, Macias explained. Each step on the blockchain was, in itself, a marketing tagline.  “When they’re able to show buyers in Italy and Miami exactly where the coffee came from – the path that it took, the ingredients that were used, the fertilizers, everything – they saw it as a great marketing opportunity.”  Counting Beans  Under GrainChain’s platform, farmers at Santa Rosa de Copan and other participating growers document their coffee production via a real-time mobile app, according to Macias. Each stakeholder tracks those beans as they make their way through the system.  The system’s smart contracts pay each stakeholder exactly what they say they will, without regard for potential biases that humans often introduce.  This transparency contrasts with the often informal “handshake-like” deals that Macias says permeated the market beforehand. Farmers might agree to sell their crop for $5, for example, but end up earning far less because of a middleman’s opinion. That would, in turn, impact the farmers’ ability to pay back bank loans.  “It’s very different than what you can get away with when a person’s involved,” Macias said.  GrainChain’s real-time record-keeping system makes the banks more eager to loan to farmers whose output they can check, and whose use of loan funds they can control.  “Given a lot of our traceability and logistics applications that we have within our system, it opens up the door to people to see what’s really going on,” Macias said.  Off-the-grid Honduran farmers and concept-heavy blockchains make unnatural bedfellows; Delcid, the Santa Rosa de Copan coffee farmer, is the first to admit it.

42382732,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sjpj,1569326450,Crypto-Powered IoT Networks Are on Their Way to Over 250 US Cities,"When internet-of-things (IoT) startup Helium first announced its crypto-mining modems, sales of the devices were limited to users in Austin, Texas.  The company quickly sold out of its first production run designated for the Texas capital, but now Helium is shipping units much more broadly, to 263 cities around the United States, CoinDesk has learned.  Of that group, a company spokesperson said the key cities are New York, San Francisco, Boulder, Denver, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Houston and Seattle. Shipments for this next wave of hotspot production should begin in October.  To recap  , Helium is a network meant to help IoT devices like e-scooters, simple sensors and pet trackers get low-volume data to the internet quickly and at very low cost.  At-home Helium hotspots mine helium tokens by performing tasks useful to the network, such as verifying the location of nodes, the sequence of data and the location of devices sending data over the network. Companies that want to transmit data using Helium hotspots must pay with a second token, data credits, which can only be obtained by burning helium.  In other words, by rewarding people for setting up these $495 hotspots and connecting them to the internet, the system gives people an incentive to deploy the network on Helium's behalf, rather than forcing the company to sort out its own footprint.  Marcela Gomez, a researcher at the University of Pittsburgh who has looked at economic models for computing networks, told CoinDesk:  ""Several approaches have been researched, especially within the cognitive radio domain, for radios to cooperate with each other so that they can use network resources more efficiently when transferring data. The Helium case seems like a good example of putting this to practice.""  User feedback  Frank Mong, Helium's chief operating officer, told CoinDesk the company has learned a number of lessons deploying as many hotspots as possible in Austin in a short period of time.  The product attracted a lot of people interested in networking who weren't necessarily well-versed in crypto, so Helium had to make a number of design decisions to improve the user experience.  ""Having a field of real consumers onboarding hotspots all in one day was definitely a good learning experience for us,"" Mong said.  For example, the company increased the size of the token pool dramatically so that users would receive whole tokens rather than partial tokens, which some found confusing.  Proportionally, Mong said, it amounts to the same thing, it's just a question of how it appears to users.  The firm is already seeing early efforts to win whale positions.  Said Mong:  ""There are entrepreneurs and people who are in the tech world, IoT or real estate, where they understand building a network and providing access. And that being early has advantages.""  Some of these early enthusiasts are buying as many as 50 Helium hotspots and deploying them themselves around geographic areas, making Helium's work much easier.  More interestingly, Helium had to learn about how networking works in real situations. Helium hotspots are constantly trying to prove their location by sending out signals and triangulating with other nodes on the network. Helium uses spectrum that can move through just about anything, but different materials and conditions can still impact transmission.  ""That baseline can't be established before you join a network. It can only be established after you join the network,"" Mong said. ""As hotspots come on board, it's like a living organism that learns and adapts.""  Before long, there will be additional ways for interested parties to participate, Mong said, such as by offering blockchain nodes that store the ledger without transmitting data.  Token talk  Helium is staying out of getting its tokens onto exchanges, but anyone mining them can do anything they want with them as soon as they show up.  That said, eventually, users will be able to sell helium to users of the network, but only denominated in data credits. That means a user would indicate the wallet the credits are destined for, receive payment and burn their helium tokens. Then the, say, scooter company using the network would have its data credits topped up, allowing the company's scooters to send data over the Helium network.  Helium's initial partners, such as food conglomerate Nestlé and pet-tracking company InvisiLeash, are using its network now but not yet paying for it, Mong said. That day will come, however.  Of course, enterprise customers have other options.  ""Within the IoT domain, big telecom companies offer their legacy networks for IoT services at low costs (e.g., AT&T LTE-M and NB-IoT),"" Pitt professor Gomez said via email. ""It would be one of Helium’s tasks to provide sufficient incentives for creating this decentralized network.""  Kyle Ellicott, founder of ReadWrite Labs and a longtime IoT investor, was less concerned about the incumbent competition. Most major telecoms are focused on getting customers onto existing infrastructure or 5G, he said, which may still be too costly for sending thermometer data to the web.  Plus, Ellicott argued that places can be overlooked by telecoms but easily added with Helium's grassroots approach. A large farm that wants to collect data from sensors, for example, could throw up a few Helium hotspots for less than a few thousand dollars and cover an enormous amount of land.  Ellicott said:  ""The process of what Helium and others are doing is it's a next step in the generation of technology being all throughout our lives.""

42382731,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sjqz,1569326446,"In Rare Deal, Crypto Custodian Wins Insurance on Full Value of Client Assets","Marsh & McLennan, the world’s largest insurance broker, has arranged an unusually generous and comprehensive insurance program for a new cryptocurrency custodian called KNØX.  Unveiled Tuesday, Montreal-based KNØX is courting wealth managers and hedge funds with its cold storage service, in which the cryptographic private keys to a wallet are kept offline. To give potential clients additional peace of mind, the insurance arranged by Marsh covers them in case of external theft and internal collusion, up to the full value of their holdings.  By contrast, often insurance policies covering crypto assets are shared across multiple clients of a custodian, explained Alex Daskalov, co-founder and CEO of KNØX. For example, a custodian holding $1 billion in assets, and advertising a $100 million insurance policy may only be 10 percent insured, in which case the customer is given a false sense of security, Daskalov argued. If the customer were to experience a total loss of $100 million they would only be reimbursed $10 million.  The KNØX program was developed with Marsh to remove ambiguity of this sort, Daskalov told CoinDesk:  “Often we see people purchase an insurance policy and then hold in the aggregate funds well above the limit of that insurance policy. So for us, it was an important guarantee that when a customer is on-boarded to our platform, the full value of their assets is insured.”  That’s not to say the cover is limitless. “There is, of course, an upper ceiling,” Daskalov acknowledged, without saying precisely what it is.  Asked if KNØX was ready to hold and insure north of $100 million for any of its customers, Daskalov said this would “not be a problem.” (To put that figure in context, until recently, the largest amount of insurance cover heard of in the crypto space was when Coinbase was reported to have up to $255 million).  Jennifer Hustwitt, senior vice president at Marsh, told CoinDesk the insurance cover being offered with the KNØX solution was led by insurance company Arch and supported by various syndicates at Lloyd’s of London.  Freshly funded  KNØX recently raised $6.2 million in funding led by Initialized and iNovia, with participation from Fidelity Investments Canada, FJ Labs, and Ferst Capital.  Daskalov said that for custodying and insuring 100 percent of a customer’s assets, KN0X would charge a fee starting at 1 percent of assets and work down depending on how much business was being conducted. To get a customer’s assets out of cold storage in order to trade would normally take an hour, although the service level agreements (SLAs) are more conservative, he said.  While scarce, crypto insurance cover is popping into the headlines with increasing regularity, thanks to the likes of blockchain security firm BitGo touting $100 million cover from Lloyd’s and Coinbase exploring new avenues with the number two insurance broker Aon, which is also working with custody providers Anchorage and Volt.  Hustwitt said there has been a net expansion of insurance capacity available for digital asset risks in the past six months.  Some carriers are starting to participate in programs who previously had not and this is edging up the capacity and size of insurance deals, she said. “At any given time the amount of overall capacity will depend on a risk-by-risk basis. Having said that, there is upwards of $750 million to $1 billion in potential insurance capacity available across specie and financial institutions insurance markets.”  A caveat would be that the carriers participating and the capacity changes on a month to month basis, said Hiustwitt, concluding:  “Our working metric right now is up to a billion. We break new ground with every deal we do.”  Vault via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | ZRX,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/09/24/in-rare-deal-crypto-custodian-wins-insurance-on-full-value-of-client-assets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f993b21b65f71d028d641150eb1127ce2c0ccd06-1000x854.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382728,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sjnD,1569326403,Flipside Crypto Raises $7.1 Million to Give Tokens Better Analytics,"Data analytics startup Flipside Crypto, already backed by Coinbase Ventures and Digital Currency Group, has raised another funding round to solidify its service offerings.  Galaxy Digital, headed by hedge fund veteran (and runway model) Mike Novogratz, led a fresh $7.1 million round in Flipside Crypto this summer. Previous investors, such as Castle Island Ventures, also participated.  In total, Flipside has raised more than $11.6 million since it was founded in 2017. CEO Dave Balter told CoinDesk the startup is now valued at $32.1 million. He plans to grow from roughly 14 employees to 21 by the beginning of 2020.  “We have sophisticated tools to determine behavioral segmentation on top of [blockchain data], to understand specific stakeholder activity,” Balter said. “The ultimate framing of the service is trying to identify activities and, justifiably, what they do to the price of the asset.”  Although Balter said 75 organizations have signed up to receive the free Flipside Analytics suite, only a few dozen users like Algorand are paying customers so far. For those customers, understanding specific metrics – such as who is staking tokens on a network and how their voter behavior compares to other networks – can help guide business decisions.  Algorand COO Sean Ford told CoinDesk real-time insights help his startup “stay ahead.”  “We work with several other data service providers, but none like Flipside,” Ford said. “The biggest difference with Flipside for us has been the ability to customize your approach to data and analysis of results.”  Whether it’s looking at voting patterns, developer activity or users’ trading habits, Flipside's Balter said many projects are specifically looking for activities that correlate with increased token prices. This isn’t unique to Flipside Crypto clients. One unaffiliated market maker told CoinDesk many prospective customers also prioritize price gains as the leading metric of success.  Castle Island co-founder Nic Carter, who also co-founded the separate analytics firm Coin Metrics, told CoinDesk:  “The interesting thing about crypto is that these networks/crypto assets trade in real time, so naturally you have price feedback for any new fundamental developments. That's both a bug and a feature. Startups aren't repriced whenever they sign a new client, so that growth isn't as evident. But in crypto assets, it's manifested in real time, so the price conversation tends to dominate.”  Price insights  According to Flipside Crypto’s analysis of 520 cryptocurrencies, it appears the perception of a network or asset’s future potential has a stronger impact on the market than its actual usage.  Balter highlighted one “abnormal” pattern compared to non-crypto startups and assets: a growing customer base doesn’t directly impact price.  “You can’t associate those two things [real users and price] just yet,” Balter said, adding that he expects this to shift as the market matures. “Related to insights, in one case Flipside identified an issue with a token provider's auction program. In this case, the client realized, they’d be better off driving nobody [to the product] than just a handful of people.”  However, Avon Ventures partner and Flipside Crypto investor Sachin Patodia said in a press release that analytics are crucial to guiding long-term growth as projects “mature” into “mainstream businesses.” As such, some investors see equity in analytics firms as bets that complement other crypto investments.  The leading blockchain analytics firms (not including those specializing in law enforcement and compliance) often share overlapping investors. For example, Balter is personally an investor in Coin Metrics, the same way Carter’s firm invested in Balter’s startup.  Both men said they don’t view these analytics startups as direct competitors because Flipside is doubling down on serving blockchain projects themselves, while Coin Metrics is focused on investors evaluating those networks and assets.  “If you can get detailed insight into how some protocol tweak alters the economics of a network, that is very valuable for the people designing these things,” Carter said, adding:  “We think there will be a multiplicity of blockchain analytics firms that succeed, because the blockchain industry is so data-rich, as these things are natively transparent.”  Team image via Flipside Crypto",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | SPONSORED | TRADING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/09/24/flipside-crypto-raises-71-million-to-give-tokens-better-analytics,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5abb6b79424913bc6e30c1acef91f48f3ed961b7-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382738,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sjyX,1569322818,Bitcoin Looks South After Price Squeeze Ends With Drop to $9.6K,"View  Bitcoin fell to $9,600 earlier today, marking a downside break of recent low-volatility consolidation represented by the narrowing of Bollinger bands.  The Bollinger band breakdown has opened the doors for a slide to $9,320 (August low).  A break above $10,380 (Sept. 19 high) is needed to neutralize the bearish setup.      Bitcoin's recent low-volatility price squeeze has ended with a downside break that may see the cryptocurrency drop to the August low of $9,320 in the short-term.  The top cryptocurrency had been largely trading in a very narrow range ($9,600–$10,500) in the 11 days to Sept. 21.  As a result, BTC's price volatility, as represented by the spread between the Bollinger bands, dropped to the lowest level in over four months last week. Bollinger bands are volatility indicators placed two standard deviations above and below the price’s 20-day moving average.  A low-volatility period often paves the way for a big move on either side. In BTC's case, the big move has happened to the downside. Bitcoin fell by 3.38 percent on Monday – the biggest single-day loss since Aug. 29 as per Bitstamp data – and closed (UTC) well below the lower Bollinger band, confirming a downside break of the low-volatility consolidation.  Prices hit a low of $9,600 earlier today and continue to trade below the lower Bollinger band, currently at $9,767.  So, the sellers have come out victorious in a close tug of war with the bulls and a deeper drop could be in the offing. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $9,730 on Bitstamp.  Daily chart  The spread between the Bollinger bands narrowed to $656 on Sept. 21, the lowest since May – a squeeze that's now ended with a price breakdown.  The path of least resistance is therefore to the downside and BTC could challenge support at $9,320 (Aug. 29 low) in the next couple of days. On the way lower, the cryptocurrency may find support at $9,388 – the lower edge of a three-month contracting triangle.  Supporting the bearish case is the sub-50 reading on the 14-day relative strength index. Further, the MACD histogram is charting deeper bars below the zero line – a sign of strengthening bearish momentum.  A UTC close below $9,388 would confirm a contracting triangle breakdown and may yield a deeper sell-off below $9,000.  The bearish outlook would be invalidated if prices rise above $10,380 – the high of a bullish hammer that formed on Sept. 19.  That said, a break above the upper edge of the contracting triangle, currently at $10,692, is needed to revive the bullish outlook. A triangle breakout, if confirmed, would imply a resumption of the rally from April's low near $4,000 and open the doors for a sustained break above key resistance at $12,000.  4-hour chart  BTC defended support of the Sept. 19 low of $9,600 earlier today.  If the support level continues to hold ground in the U.S. trading hours, the cryptocurrency may rise back toward $9,900, as the RSI is hovering very close to the oversold territory (below 30).

ZP Legal’s efforts could result in the extradition to Russia of Alexander Vinnik, the alleged operator of defunct exchange BTC-e, who’s also wanted in the U.S. for Mt. Gox-related charges.      A Russian law firm’s audacious proposal for recovering up to $2 billion stolen from Mt. Gox in return for a steep fee has divided the failed bitcoin exchange’s creditors.  A minority of creditors have decided it’s better to take a chance on Moscow-based ZP Legal than sit and wait for Nobuaki Kobayashi, Mt. Gox’s court-appointed trustee in Japan, to finish the corporate restructuring process.  According to Alexander Zheleznikov, ZP Legal’s managing partner, creditors holding claims for a combined 15,000 BTC (worth $150 million at current prices) have signed up for his firm’s services. That’s less than 8 percent of the bitcoin he claims he might recover. (Any recovered funds would most likely be repaid in fiat.) Applications to ZP Legal were due Sept. 22.  However, many viewed the offer with skepticism, especially given the hefty fees ZP Legal has been asking for: 50 to 75 percent of the recovered funds, depending on how much each creditor gets, plus $320 per hour, charged only in the case of success.  “While a small number of creditors have already signed up with ZP Legal, it seems the more prevalent view among creditors is strong criticism,” Kim Nilsson, a creditor, told CoinDesk. “The fee they’re asking feels unconscionably high given that these are people’s lost savings we’re talking about.”  As CoinDesk previously reported, ZP Legal approached Mt. Gox Legal (MGL), an association representing the creditors, in February, via then-head of MGL Andy Pag.  The proposition, in short, was to leverage the previously established connection between the 2014 Mt. Gox hack and defunct Russian crypto exchange BTC-e, where some of the 750,000 stolen bitcoins ended up.  ZP Legal offered to file police reports in Russia on the creditors’ behalf. Then, creditors would have to wait for alleged BTC-e operator Alexander Vinnik to get extradited to Russia and for the police to find the other culprits — with ZP Legal's help. The thieves would either plead guilty and return the stolen funds to receive lighter sentences, or get convicted and then be sued by creditors for damages.  But in addition to the fees, a number of other things about the proposal have spooked creditors.  ‘Mystery box’  For example, the vague language of ZP Legal’s proposal felt manipulative, Nilsson said. “The sales pitch has rather been that there are no options, ‘just trust us, this is an exclusive deal with only limited availability, better hurry and sign up,’ and so forth.”  Lawyer and Mt. Gox creditor Daniel Kelman also questioned the way ZP Legal communicated about its tactics to the creditors.  “These lawyers have treated their engagement like it’s a mystery box, asking us to first gamble with a majority of our right to recovery before we can take their legal strategy out of its package,” Kelman wrote in his blog.  This approach made many creditors feel “not so much being served as clients but rather being served up for dinner,” Nilsson wrote, adding:  “The money being pursued here were life-altering losses to many people, and just because we didn’t expect more of it to be recovered doesn’t mean we might as well not need it back and are happy for our ‘saviors’ to help themselves to the lion’s share of it. In short, don’t reach for blood money quite so casually.”  Another issue with the offer, Nilsson went on, is that while the civil rehabilitation process is designed to compensate all the creditors with approved claims, the plan ZP has been proposing will benefit only those who choose to sign up for it.  At the same time, according to a Telegram chat for Mt. Gox creditors, people are worried about what happens if some creditors choose to use both ZP Legal’s service and the Japanese court’s civil rehabilitation process, potentially ending up in a better situation than others.  “Most creditors want any and all recoveries to be done on behalf of all creditors and shared equally on a pro-rata basis. I think we can expect severe conflicts between different ‘classes’ of creditors if a subset of creditors pursue this Russian recovery separately and keep the money,” Nilsson explained.  According to Zheleznikov himself, his firm has been in talks with the trustee’s team about the possible collaboration. However, it’s not clear if any common plan of action has been or is expected to be worked out. The next meeting of the creditors with the trustee is scheduled for Oct. 1 and expected to clarify the situation.  It’s also not clear how legal procedures in Japan and Russia would work together in such a case, and if any legal action ZP Legal might take conflict with the process in Japan, which deals with the obligations of Mt. Gox as an entity and doesn’t stipulate any form of individual compensation directly from third parties.  Still other creditors decided to pursue the “Russian recovery” path, but with a firm that would work cheaper. Mt. Gox creditor Frank Lee told CoinDesk he found a Moscow-based lawyer named Ivan Bunik, of the law firm Timofeev, Farenvald and Partners, who agreed to look into the case.  According to the creditors’ Telegram chat, Bunik would represent the creditors in Russia for “either $200 per hour for work performed with a maximum cap of $7,000 per month (including outside services) or 25 percent of eventual recovery, whichever is greater.”  When reached by CoinDesk, Bunik refused to comment on the situation, except to say no agreement had been signed yet.  Muddy waters  The main question, in the meantime, remains whether the strategy ZP Legal presented to the creditors is feasible.  Cryptocurrency currently has no legal status in Russia, and actual criminal cases related to bitcoin are rare. According to Gleb Plesovskikh, head of Plesovskih and Partners law firm, the regulatory uncertainty makes recovering stolen crypto in Russia problematic.  “There have been some criminal cases related to cryptocurrencies in Russia, but they were based on the current criminal law, so the criminal activities have been classified as illegal banking services or money laundering, for example,” Plesovskikh, a former law enforcement officer, told CoinDesk.  He added that in such cases, Russian law enforcement would rather investigate the mentioned conventional crimes than “the theft of crypto-assets from a foreign company.”  As for ZP Legal’s strategy, the creditors should “read between the lines,” Plesovskikh said:  “It’s something that is obvious for the lawyers working with our law enforcement system: once the ‘culprits’ are found and a certain pressure is applied to them with the help of the law enforcement, to ease their fate, they will volutеer to return the stolen funds.”  For example, Plesovskikh said he once represented the investors of a failed initial coin offering (ICO) in Russia, and after being called up by the police, the ICO launchers offered to return the money, to prevent a criminal case from opening.  Zheleznikov mentioned a similar tactic describing ZP Legal’s work with users of the failed crypto exchange WEX, the successor to BTC-e. According to him, the sides also reached a settlement without a criminal investigation.  “There are for sure some chances of success with this case, but let’s face the reality: most likely, there won’t be any actual criminal case on the crypto-assets theft as such,” Plesovskikh said of ZP Legal’s Mt. Gox proposal.  Zheleznikov himself has acknowledged ZP Legal can’t guarantee a successful recovery for the Mt. Gox creditors, that the firm will be operating in a legal grey zone and that the strategy might take years to bear fruit.  Saving Private Vinnik  In the meantime, some of the creditors suspect that the whole operation ZP Legal is planning has a totally different objective: boosting the chances that Vinnik will be extradited to Russia instead of the U.S., by presenting more victims on the Russian side. He is currently detained in Greece.  According to this theory, the Russian government wants to prevent Vinnik from falling into the hands of the FBI due to the role BTC-e played in at least one story involving the Russian political elite.  Fancy Bear, the hacker group linked to Russian intelligence that attacked the Democratic National Committee email server during the 2016 presidential campaign, purchased bitcoin on BTC-e to fund its operations, according to an investigation by the BBC and Elliptic.  (President Vladimir Putin’s press secretary Dmitri Peskov denied any affiliation between the Russian authorities and Fancy Bear. ""We are unaware what kind of hackers they refer to, we do not know what this interference entails,” Peskov told the Russian news agency Interfax last August.)  Whatever the motivation, Russia’s interest in getting Vinnik back has been expressed at the highest level. In January, Putin personally raised the issue during talks with the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, according to Russian news outlet RIA Novosti.  “The conclusion of Vinnik’s extradition may be influenced by [Greece’s] decision to take into consideration of how many victims and financial damages each country has,” Mt. Gox creditor Lee wrote in a blog post.  Zheleznikov's clients include high-profile individuals such as the oligarch Konstantin Malofeev, an alleged sponsor of the pro-Russian separatist forces in Ukraine, and the police investigator Pavel Karpov, sanctioned by the U.S. following the Magnitsky Act.  However, he denied that getting Vinnik extradited to Russia is his primary goal.  Zheleznikov told CoinDesk his aim has been to “form the legal practice, help the creditors and, in case of success, make money,” concluding:  “If Vinnik’s extradition helps the case, we’re glad to see any legal event helping our plans, but the extradition itself is not our goal and we don’t represent Vinnik’s interests.”  Alexander Vinnik image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/09/24/for-desperate-mt-gox-victims-long-shot-bitcoin-deal-beats-endless-wait,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/430989369721263dba973f1d5f18c75f6d7728b7-1490x1089.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382714,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9shQ1,1569304824,"Crypto is an Intangible Asset, Global Accounting Standards Body Argues","Cryptocurrency holdings are neither cash nor financial assets, but meet the definition of an intangible asset, at least according to an influential global accounting standards body.  The Korea Times said in a report on Monday that according to the Korea Accounting Institute, the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) made such decisions after a meeting in London in June.  Indeed, the London-based IFRIC, which sets the International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS), concluded in a little-noticed document dated June 21 that holdings of cryptocurrency meet the definition of an intangible asset, on the grounds that ""(a) it is capable of being separated from the holder and sold or transferred individually; and (b) it does not give the holder a right to receive a fixed or determinable number of units of currency.""  Intangible assets are defined by the committee as non-monetary assets without physical substance. It has also concluded that cryptocurrency is not equity and does not give the holder contractual rights of exchange. Importantly, it said crypto is not cash because it is not, for practical purposes, a medium of exchange.  The Committee added that in some cases, cryptocurrency could be accounted for as inventory if an entity ""hold cryptocurrencies for sale in the ordinary course of business.""  Stepping back, the treatment of cryptocurrency was not added to the committee's standard-setting agenda, which means that the recent disclosure only reflects the thinking of the body and not an actual rule.  But once the committee sets a standard, it tends to be followed, as IFRS is used in about 144 jurisdictions and is required for public companies in Singapore, South Korea and almost all of Europe, though the U.S. has so far been only using the framework of the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  Accounting treatment for cryptocurrency has been in discussion since about 2016, with numerous talks held and papers submitted. The IFRIC recently received 23 comment letters on the subject from a wide range of interested parties, including the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), The Indonesian Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Korea Accounting Standards Board (KASB) and the Accounting Standards Board of Japan (ASBJ).

42382720,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9shXZ,1569296223,CoinDesk Victim of Hoax in Which Fake Kik CEO Claimed to Quit,"UPDATE (Sept. 24, 13:50 UTC): This article has been updated to rectify inaccuracies in our original reporting.      CoinDesk has become the apparent victim of a Telegram hoax, in which an unknown individual sought to spread misinformation by posing as Ted Livingston, CEO of messaging startup Kik.  CoinDesk regrets the error and the publication of the original story.  The company has since said that Livingston was on a flight from Tel Aviv, Israel, to Washington, D.C., en route to Toronto, at the time CoinDesk believed it was speaking to the executive and was he was not making use of the available internet connection and thus couldn't have responded to inquires.  Livingston was not immediately available for comment, but did issue a message on Twitter denying he was considering leaving the company over stresses from ongoing legal action against U.S. regulators. It read: “I just landed in Washington. I took off from Tel Aviv 12 hours ago. This is obviously fabricated. I’m not sure how Coindesk could make such an obvious mistake, but we’ll find out.”  The company has provided Livingston's official Telegram username, which is not the account with which CoinDesk communicated.  In the wake of news Kik had laid off the majority of its Israel-based development team, our reporter sought to contact representatives of the company, finding a Telegram handle operating under the username ""Ted E Bear"" and bearing the likeness of Livingston.  In response to questions about the incident at the company, the account provided what appeared to be official statements on the news that Kik is shutting down. At the time, our reporter contacted representatives of Kik to verify the statements given on Telegram.  Press messages to Livingston's Kik email, as well as the company's formal press and contact emails went unreturned.  A Kik representative later reached out to clarify part of the story that indicated the Kin Foundation was shutting down along with the Kik messenger, as stated in our original article. The article was corrected to indicate only the Kik messenger is shutting down, not the non-profit overseeing its cryptocurrency.  The company did not indicate at the time that Livingston was traveling or raise suspicion about the language used in the article that suggested our reporter had talked to the CEO.  The messages issued by the false account were identical to those from a Medium post issued by Livingston in the wake of the news, describing the number of monthly active users at the company and affirming Kik's stance that the move was the result of its ongoing battles with the SEC.  The account later sent a message in which it appeared Livingston was attempting to tell an investor he was considering leaving his role as CEO and that steps may be taking place to transition the operations of the company to other senior leaders. The message was later deleted.  When asked about the message, the account indicated it had ""no comment"" and asked that the reporter ""keep anything to [themselves].""  Our reporter did not make an additional attempt to contact Kik. He did make an attempt to contact board member and investor William Mougayar, to whom the deleted text was seemingly addressed, though messages were not returned.  After the story was published, the name on the Telegram account changed to ""R Mo,"" at which time the image on the account was replaced with an image of ""Magic Internet Money Wizard,"" a long-standing bitcoin meme.  The account wrote:  ""Dude you gotta pull that story. I'm not Ted, never claimed to be. You assumed. Just an internet member of a decentralized unofficial comms channel. That is a fan channel that shitposts not the kin channel.""

According to the SEC’s lawsuit, the company claimed that investors could purchase its token and use them to request certain actions in a live adult performance on the platform.  “Fantasy Market is a role-playing performance marketplace for live, client-controlled digital performances,” according to the company’s LinkedIn profile. “Through the use of our tokens, you control what the performers say and do during the show.”  All the team members in the company are fictional except for Lucas, according to the complaint, which listed many false statements made by the company in promoting its ICO.  The ICO took place from Sept. 3 - Oct. 16, 2017, aiming to raise $25 million, with 125 million FMTs for sale and pricing each token at 20 cents, according to the token’s white paper.  In the six-week period, Fantasy Market raised about $63,000 in cryptocurrency from more than 100 investors in its fraudulent offer and sale of unregistered digital securities -- CEO Lucas actually claimed to the press he had raised $2 million towards the $25 million goal.  The SEC said Lucas promoted the sale of FMTs by misleading prospective investors.  He told the investors there had been a private pre-sale for accredited investors whereas it never happened. Lucas also said the token would be listed on major exchanges and the company had verified that its investors were accredited; neither of the claims are true.  The company made a further false statement when it affirmed all of its transactions are secured because users could only purchase the token with bitcoin or litecoin on ERC-20 blockchain, which was not the case.  In fact, according to the SEC’s charges, no token was every issued and his ethereum application never existed. The money raised went to marketing rather than building the product.  The SEC filing was accompanied by a consent judgment, meaning that the defendant accepted the ruling against him.

Following reports its crypto-focused subsidiary Kin had laid off 70 employees, Kik Interactive CEO Ted Livingston announced Monday that Kik will also be shutting down its core messaging service.  In a company blog post, Livingston said the ongoing dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has forced Kik to close its doors.  ""After 18 months of working with the SEC the only choice they gave us was to either label Kin a security or fight them in court,"" Livingston wrote. ""So with the SEC working to characterize almost all cryptocurrencies as securities we made the decision to step forward and fight.""  In addition to shutting down the app, Livingston said the company would shrink its crypto operations to just 19 core developers with a focus on fostering the adoption of Kik's KIN cryptocurrency.  ""Kin has over 2,000,000 monthly active earners, and 600,000 monthly active spenders,"" he wrote. ""While losing Kik will have a big impact on these numbers, the continued growth of the Kin Ecosystem has more than made up for it.""  Kik is currently in a dispute with the SEC over the 2017 initial coin offering of its KIN token. The ICO raised $100 million, which the SEC claims was an unregistered securities offering. Since the SEC allegations in June, Kin’s token has dropped from $0.000036 to $0.0000105 as of today, according to data provider Messari.  While the Kik app is shutting down, Livingston said the core developer team is pivoting toward developing the KIN token.  He wrote:  ""Kin is a currency used by millions of people in dozens of independent apps. So while the SEC might be able to push us around, taking on the broader Kin Ecosystem will be a much bigger fight. And the Ecosystem is close to adding a lot more firepower.""  Israeli news site Calcalist first reported the Kin layoffs. Calcalist also claimed Kin was being shut down as parts of the technology would be moved to different platforms, such as the Kik app.  Aspects of the report were confirmed on the Kin Foundation’s official Reddit page. “I can confirm a restructure is happening,” a spokesman from the foundation wrote at the time.
