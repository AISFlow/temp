42378495,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iTkR,1452033147,Digital Currency Exchange Cryptsy Suspends Trading,"UPDATE (6th January 14:55 BST): Cryptsy has removed the advisory from its main page and trading has reportedly recommenced.      Cryptsy, the digital currency exchange that has been dogged by rumors of insolvency amid persistent issues related to user withdrawals, has said that it has suspended its trade engine.  ""Trade engine and withdrawals paused while we investigate cause of lag. Your patience is appreciated. Thank you,"" a message on the main Cryptsy page read at press time.  The exchange, which specializes in the trading of alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins), has long been the subject of controversy. The exchange reported roughly 235 BTC in volume over the past 24 hours, but has long faced criticism over issues involving the withdrawal of user funds  Posts on social media and emails provided to CoinDesk provide evidence that some users have had issues taking their money out of the exchange since this fall. The continued issues – and what some users say is a lack of clarity from the exchange’s management team – have prompted claims that the exchange is insolvent or is the target of regulatory scrutiny.  The withdrawal complaints have prompted popular altcoin pricing site CoinMarketCap to delist the exchange, a move it also attributed to ""skewed"" prices on the platform. The site stated on Twitter that it would add Cryptsy after the issues are resolved.  In the past, Cryptsy has attributed the problems to technical issues, as well as denial-of-service attacks.  The problems have elicited comparisons to Mt Gox, the now-defunct Japan-based bitcoin exchange that, prior to its collapse, blamed technical problems for withdrawal problems and ultimately cut off access to customer funds.  Cryptsy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

42378497,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iToD,1452029421,Accenture: Global Insurers Will Embrace the Blockchain,"A managing director for Accenture has published a new blog post detailing why he believes the insurance industry will move to embrace the blockchain within the ""next few years"".  Abizer Rangwala, who focuses on insurance IT strategy for the professional services firm, wrote on 4th January that he expects the technology to ""have a profound effect on business"", adding that, in his opinion, this impact is already underway.  Rangwala wrote:  ""Insurance is gaining momentum in the use of blockchain and slowly figuring out the true business use or to some degree what the use case should be. I have no doubt that within the next few years it will be a major technology in the insurance ecosystem.""  Some major insurance companies have already begun exploring proofs-of-concept that utilize a blockchain. Last year, insurance firm Lloyd's indicated its support for using the technology within the London Market, the UK-based international insurance market.  Rangwala went on to speculate that while it may take some time for specific products to emerge within the insurance market that utilize a blockchain, there are some indications of what those offerings may look like, including those that operate on a peer-to-peer scale.  ""The effect of blockchain for insurance products is a not as clear-cut and will likely take longer to emerge than for banking,"" he wrote. ""The speed and ease with which contracts could be changed and the time-stamping feature of blockchain could, for example, facilitate individualized contracts that reflect actual risk, such as on-demand auto insurance effective only during hours a car is being driven.""  Accenture has pushed for financial firms to embrace the blockchain in past reports, and in July added Bitspark to its Asia-Pacific financial tech accelerator.  The firm has also called for regulators to increase oversight of bitcoin wallets, calling for the creation of ""reasonable and proportionate"" rules governing wallet offerings. Overbearing regulation, Accenture wrote in a submission to the UK government, could ""stifle innovation"".

42378515,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iU3J,1452016763,Vermont's Blockchain Recordkeeping Report Due Next Week,"A report on the use of blockchain technology as a mechanism for storing state records is set to be delivered to the Vermont legislature by 15th January.  According to a summary of the bill, the study is intended to explore ""opportunities and risks"" for storing electronic facts using blockchain technology. The final version of the bill also requires that the report focus on addressing ""unresolved regulatory issues"".  The mandate for the study was part of an economic development bill signed into law last summer by Governor Peter Shumlin.  The law instructs the state's Attorney General, the Secretary of State and the Department of Financial Regulation to develop the report and draw from insight from the Center for Legal Innovation at Vermont Law School and the Uniform Law Commissionhttp://www.uniformlaws.org/.  According to attorney Carl Lisman, a ULC commissioner who has taken part in the drafting of the report, it is ""almost, but not yet, complete"". He declined to divulge details on the contents or conclusions of the report.  While the state may be looking to adopt the technology for record-keeping purposes, Vermont has already taken steps to regulate aspects of its local digital currency ecosystem.  Susan Donegan, commissioner of the state’s Department of Financial Regulation, told CoinDesk last year that her agency is applying existing statutes to businesses working with the technology.  Representatives of the Attorney General, the Secretary of State, the Department of Financial Regulation and the Center for Legal Innovation at Vermont Law School did not immediately respond to CoinDesk’s requests for comment.

42378503,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iTtF,1452011568,BitPay Among Latest to Join Microsoft Blockchain Platform,"Microsoft has announced the latest update to its forthcoming blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) offering for its cloud-based Azure platform.  In a blog post, US financial services strategy director Marley Gray indicated four new partners have joined the project, including bitcoin payment processor BitPay; blockchain rewards platform Manifold Technology; bitcoin tax service LibraTax; and proof-of-ownership blockchain service Emercoin.  With more than $32m in venture capital raised, BitPay is the best-funded startup to join the Azure blockchain offering, with the majority of those involved being smaller, early-stage blockchain startups and decentralized projects.  BitPay told CoinDesk that Bitcore, its open-source bitcoin full node and development service, will be the offering that is added to the platform.  First revealed in late October, partners on the Microsoft service already include startups CoinPrism, ConsenSys, Eris Industries and Factom. Microsoft has also indicated it is exploring how to add support for the Interledger protocol, created by blockchain startup Ripple.  Gray further indicated that more names are likely to be added to the Azure platform over ""the next several weeks"" as it prepares for formal launch.

42411667,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gleoxa,1451988917,The Quiet Revolution: Bitcoins for Grandma,"I had family that lived in Rypin, Poland.  We went to visit every few years during the 1980s and 1990s, the whole American side winging over to Warsaw in an LOT 747 with a wonky overhead projector that played third-run movies and a staff that was at once kind and surly.  We'd ride from Warsaw's airport in a taxi piloted by a mustachioed man who asked for about $60 to carry us 155 kilometers in his FSO Polonez – popular in the 1980s because it fit more than two people and wasn't quite a death trap.  When we finally got to the small town in the middle of nowhere we would end up in what looked like an abandoned settlement. A delicate skein of coal smoke fell over the streets at night – people were home – and dogs barked in the distance but there were few people visible in town.  Then there were the rows of empty houses.  The 1990s brought a post-soviet drain that sapped Poland of its professionals, and in 2004, when the EU opened the border, Poland lost many more. The resulting exodus emptied out towns like Rypin, leaving homes desolate and construction unfinished.  Row after row of houses were left incomplete, plastic billowing in empty windows and wooden floors ruined in the rain.  The plan for many was to send cash home to complete the job but, in the end, it was easier to abandon all their hard work.  Movement of money  This was the first time I saw the power of migration.  It was the first time I understood what happens when a poorer country is welcomed by a richer one, the things that change, the things that improve, the things that fail. Some of my relatives had left earlier, long before the drain, but I understood the results of their actions. They had brought me up in a place that had no empty houses and no migrations.  But this exodus happens in every country almost every year and for almost every reason. Poland’s brain drain was, in the end, beneficial to those that emigrated and it spurred an intellectual and entrepreneurial revolution when all those Poles came back home.  But in some sad cases – Syria’s escaping refugees are the most poignant – the moves are forced and the results are terrible.  These mass migrations create problem after problem, and the problems are primarily rooted in the motion of money. The unmoored become the unbanked and the unbanked fall prey to all sorts of predators who dedicate their lives and businesses to charging predatory fees for basic services we take for granted.  Why was construction halted in Rypin? There was no way to get money back home to finish the work. Why are the refugees giving up everything and leaving their homes? Because there is no sane way to move wealth out of war-torn areas into safer ones.  In short, there is a gulf between the reality of sending money and the reality of money transfers. In both cases – for the unbanked and the overly mobile – the fees associated with sending money are based on technologies pioneered in the 19th century.  It’s like we’ve connected our entire modern economic system to a noisy steam engine and expected it to perform like a V8.  That's my prediction for 2016: the world will change in ways that are yet unrecognizable to us. I'm not so naive as to say that bitcoin will help the refugee crisis. But I am optimistic enough to see a way forward for the unbanked and underbanked. I see a way for the escapee to send money home back to those she left. I see a way for the foreign worker to keep the fires burning in the hearth of home and for grandma to get the food and medicine she needs while her children and grandchildren are off changing the world.  Rypin didn't have to empty out and, if you go back today, you'll find a thriving little community. The doldrums of my youth have been replaced by a city on the edge of prosperity.  A quiet revolution  I've watched technological advances help the few over and over again.  While efforts at 3-D printing and STEM education are aimed at the world, they often fall short of the mark. Why? Because they require investment on the ground and that requires a solid and usable money transfer system.  For every feel-good story of technology air-dropped into remote areas, we find 10 places where that technology does not exist. But just as the Internet tore down informational disparities, technologies like bitcoin tear down economic disparities.  There can be no more excuses for a dedicated person not to learn from the world's biggest store of intellectual value, and there can be no more excuses for a dedicated person not to gain from the world's newest store of economic value.  The seemingly sad thing is that the coming revolution will be a quiet one.  Like all great technologies bitcoin will be soon be hidden deep behind a myriad of services and tools. It will become an anonymous pipe, understood by a high priesthood yet used by everyone. There's a reason Satoshi, bitcoin's inventor, is anonymous: he or they or she cannot become a figurehead for this new technology, just as Sir Tim Berners Lee cannot be the prime mover of the Web.  The web of money is coming and it will soon saturate our world as deeply as the Internet has.  In the end, the web of money is about sending money to places that need it. It is a great leveler, a way to make quiet places full of drifting coal smoke and lonely dogs vibrant again.  It's a way to empower the poor as they move over borders to better lives and it's a way to bring them home again when they are ready to reclaim all that they left. And, in the end, money becomes a message of home, divorced from the mess that came before. That's my hope for 2016 and beyond.
