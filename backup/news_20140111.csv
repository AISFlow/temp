42425261,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvoLh,1389476360,"Bitcoin Price Touches $1,000 Again as Overstock Sales Hit $130k","The price of bitcoin reached $1,000 again today on Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, following the news this week that online retailer Overstock.com had started accepting bitcoin as a payment method.  The peak this time around was $1,011 on Mt. Gox. Not a record but surely a notable threshold to surpass once again. The last time it broke through to four digits was back on 5th January amid news that Overstock would embrace bitcoin at some point later in the year - but it turned that around faster than everyone expected.  On 7th January, the Gox price reached $1,041.99. Around the same time, social gaming company Zynga also began testing bitcoin on its platform, likely a contributing factor to that particular price spike.  Overstock’s Announcement  It is clear that the decision by Salt Lake City-based Overstock to accept bitcoin is leading to increased interest in the digital currency. Previously, Overstock had announced that it would begin accepting bitcoin in the second half of 2014.  Those plans were accelerated, and the retailer started accepting BTC for all its items. The company, started in 1999 by CEO Patrick Byrne, is publicly traded on the NASDAQ stock exchange. Byrne told CoinDesk recently that he believes in the possibilities that bitcoin can present in the free market.  “In an ideal world we’d go back to gold so you’d have a monetary system based on something that government mandarins can’t expand at the stroke of a pen,” he said. “We’re not going to go back to gold, but bitcoin shares that virtue. It is mathematically if not physically constrained.”  Payment Success Influences Price  Byrne’s belief in bitcoin is paying off, even within 24 hours of the announcement. Overstock, the largest organization to ever accept bitcoin, had made $130,000 in BTC sales spread over 840 orders after its first day of accepting it.    #Bitcoin's first full day on @overstock.com was a huge success: 840 orders, $130,000 in sales. Almost all new customers. #stunned      — Patrick M. Byrne (@OverstockCEO) January 10, 2014        Items most purchased by #bitcoin users at @overstock: sheets, mobile phone cases, flash drives, bath towels. I expected more video cards.      — Patrick M. Byrne (@OverstockCEO) January 11, 2014          Such great success in short order is sure to lead to other companies accepting bitcoin. A popular vertical would be online retailers. In fact, there have been rumblings that electronics retailer Newegg is planning to accept bitcoin sometime soon, and that company is certainly paying attention to Overstock’s triumph.    It's a possibility, #staytuned :)RT @thedatascape: @Newegg Do you have any plans to add Bitcoin as one of your payment methods?      — Newegg (Official) (@Newegg) November 23, 2013    It seems that a pattern has developed in terms of merchant acceptance of bitcoin. In the case of Overstock’s news, the BTC price goes up as a well-known and large retailer joins the bitcoin fold. But we've also seen the opposite: bitcoin prices took a big slide on negative China news back in December when Baidu and China Telecom both stopped accepting BTC.  Volatility  When we see bitcoin succeed as a payment mechanism, we see the value of bitcoin rise. Recent good news coming from Overstock as well as the Coinbase partnership with BitMonet to enable in-app bitcoin transactions on Android are positive signs that payment transactions will grow in volume.  Nevertheless, a recent research report submitted to members of Congress entitled “Bitcoin: Questions, Answers, and Analysis of Legal Issues” discussed the possibility that bitcoin could undermine the US dollar at some point. The news of that report mixed in with positive payment news for bitcoin has likely led to a good degree of volatility in the past few days.  However, even that report pointed to network externalities like the adoption of bitcoin as a payment method as a way the bitcoin currency could become successful.  “An important force that is likely to hinder such growth in Bitcoin use is the strong preference for dollar use generated by what economists call network externalities (i.e., the value of a product or service is dependent on the number of others using it).”  The CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, which is a blend of several different exchange prices, has been hovering around $920, peaking at $934 today.  Bitcoin’s all-time price high occurred on 29th November 2013, when it was valued at $1,242 on Mt. Gox.  The price is clearly contributing to increased Wall Street interest. Fortress Investments, for example, has been reportedly planning a bitcoin-related fund. And the New York State Department of Financial Services has planned a hearing to discuss virtual currency-based policies, and perhaps the idea of issuing BitLicenses for virtual money transmitters.

42425259,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvoHh,1389446052,Take to the Skies: Private Jet Service PrivateFly Now Accepts Bitcoin,"Private jet booking service PrivateFly.com is now accepting payment in bitcoin.  The company, which was founded in 2007, will accept bitcoins via popular payment processor BitPay.  Customers can use the company's online platform, apps and operations team to access a global network of over 7,000 private aircraft, booking charter flights within 90 minutes.  Adam Twidell, co-founder and CEO at PrivateFly, said he has followed bitcoin closely since the beginning of 2012.  “As a technology-led business in an industry built around the customer, we started investigating the introduction of bitcoin after a series of requests from our clients,"" he explained.  The company specialises in rapid-response flight requests, so Twidell wanted a payment system to match – something that wasn't subject to the limitations of banking hours and could be used globally. He found what he was looking for in bitcoin.  Twidell said he thinks bitcoin payments will be popular among his clients because of the flexibility and speed offered by the payment network.  “We were surprised to find that bitcoin offers private jet customers many advantages over traditional currency payments via banks and credit cards,"" he said.  The CEO predicts that, this year, less than 5% of the payments received by PrivateFly will be in bitcoin, adding:  ""But who knows - nothing surprises me about the growth of bitcoin anymore!""    To make a payment in bitcoin, PrivateFly customers simply have to log in, choose their flight and, when prompted to pay, select the option to do so with bitcoin.    For the popular route Teterboro New York to London Farnborough, customers can fly in a 14-seat Gulfstream GIV aircraft from $53,244 for the whole plane ($3,803 per seat if the plane is fully booked). Using the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, this currently (at the time of writing) equates to 62.11 BTC for the whole plane and 4.44 BTC per seat.  Over the past two years, PrivateFly has invested heavily in marketing and technology to improve the efficiency of the service it provides. This is thanks to the $3.13m received in 2011 in venture funding from eight private investors.  ""PrivateFly.com is a highly scalable, low-risk, low-cost investment opportunity with a lean, online business model and aggressive pricing strategy. It ticked all the investor boxes,"" PrivateFly’s chairman Richard Carrick said at the time of the investment.  The company launched in 2007 and has since won travel and tourism industry awards, including a listing as one of Smarta's Top 100 Small Businesses for 2010 and Best Business Award for ""Best Innovation"" at the same time, and Flight Global's Site of the Year Webbies award. It maintains profiles on all major social networks and holds regular online promotions.  BitPay, as one of the most prominent bitcoin payment processors, is primed to handle an influx of new clients as businesses around the world begin to see bitcoin as a legitimate and cost-saving way to accept payments.    ""We believe that merchants are starting to see the value that accepting bitcoin can bring to their business,"" said BitPay's Jan Jahosky. ""We're adding merchants at a pace of 1,000 new merchants per week.""      ""We expect exponential growth in the popularity of bitcoin around the world with both merchants and consumers, and anticipate seeing the biggest growth in China, India, Russia and South America.""    Last month, BitPay celebrated processing more than $100m bitcoin transactions in 2013. Last year the company brought bitcoin to a number of popular retailers, such as Gyft and Shopify, as well as blog platform WordPress and bitcoin mining equipment producer KNC Miner.  The company assists merchants by removing what is seen as one of the biggest risk factors in accepting bitcoin – its price volatility. Businesses balk at the idea of accepting payments in a currency that may drop in value by 40-50% in a week, as bitcoin did a couple of times in 2013, as well as making exponential gains.  BitPay shoulders this risk itself, making a big wager that bitcoin's value will increase over time, and converts the bitcoins it receives into local currency to transfer into clients' bank accounts almost immediately.  BitPay's CEO, Tony Gallippi, was also praised for his defense of bitcoin and explanation of the underlying technology at last November's US Senate Committee hearings.

42425254,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvo7h,1389433372,New York State Department of Financial Services Announces Bitcoin Hearings,"The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) will hold public hearings on the regulation of digital currencies on 28th and 29th January in New York City.  It will also discuss potentially issuing something it calls ""BitLicenses"" as a regulatory requirement specific to businesses in the ""virtual"" currency field.  Financial Services Superintendent Benjamin M. Lawsky issued a notice yesterday inviting members of the press and public to attend the hearings, which will include witnesses presenting before an inquiry as well as panel discussions.  The notice warned that space would be limited, and promised ""a broad cross-section of industry participants, investors, academics and other individuals involved in the virtual currency industry.""  As the United States' predominant financial services and trading hub, New York State is bound to receive high-profile attention and set the tone for future discussions with whatever findings it reaches.  The NYDFS first raised the idea of public hearings and BitLicenses in November, around the same time the US Senate Committee was holding its own hearings. Since then there has been a marked shift in US authorities' opinions on digital currency - from initial disdain and joking to genuine curiosity.  Bitcoin's price  has leapt from around $400 the week of the hearings to something nearer $1,000, drawing in larger players and putting huge amounts of money at stake. If public statements around the world are any guide, central banks have also been rattled.  ""Our public hearing will review the interconnection between money transmission regulations and virtual currencies. Additionally, the hearing is also expected to consider the possibility and feasibility of NYDFS issuing a ‘BitLicense’ specific to virtual currency transactions and activities, which would include anti-money laundering and consumer protection requirements for licensed entities,"" the November statement said.  The outcome of the Senate hearings was seen as positive for digital currencies and bitcoin in particular. Senator Jerry Moran turned to Reddit to hear users' opinions, saying:  ""Thanks everyone. I appreciate your comments. This thread will be a valuable resource as I continue to educate myself about bitcoin and digital currency.""  Prominent members of the bitcoin and digital currency community testified as witnesses, steering the discussion away from the usual crime-and-security cliches and back towards the potential for financial innovation. Stand-out witnesses included BitPay CEO Tony Gallippi and the Bitcoin Foundation's general counsel Patrick Murck.  Over-regulation, including a requirement for many digital currency businesses to register as money transmitters separately in all 50 states, is seen as a barrier to entrepreneurship in the US and many of the world's largest bitcoin businesses are located elsewhere.  The NYDFS's statement in November, however, still listed several examples of bitcoin-related criminal activity before mentioning potential positives. While accepting some form of regulation as potentially inevitable, the digital currency community will again have its collective fingers crossed for further level-headed, conversation-setting testimonies.

42425252,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvo1h,1389398891,Adult Content Payment Processor Verotel Starts Accepting Bitcoin,"BitPay scored another big victory in the adult entertainment market Friday, when adult payment services firm Verotel announced a pilot program to accept bitcoin. The Amsterdam-based firm, which services 50,000 companies, is using BitPay to service its high-risk clients.  Tony Gallippi, CEO of BitPay, said that the deal would significantly increase his company’s order volume. The specialist bitcoin payment processor currently has over 10,000 merchants. Verotel is a privately held company that doesn’t publish revenues, but industry estimates put its total net worth at around EUR25m ($34m).  Verotel has been in operation since 1998. It has experimented with alternative payment mechanisms in the past including quick-entry ‘pay by password’ systems. The big advantage for Bitpay is that the Verotel deal unlocks the porn payment firm's entire merchant portfolio. That won't happen until March 15th, however, when Verotel opens up the current limited beta test to the rest of its customers.  This is BitPay's second big adult industry client this month, after signing Porn.com a week ago. The difference with Verotel is that it doesn't sell the content itself. Instead, it provides payment services for adult entertainment merchants. Given that Verotel is itself a payment processor, why would it need BitPay?  “They could do it themselves,” admitted Gallippi. “BitPay has three years of experience in processing bitcoin payments, which is the most in the world. So a payment provider could add BitPay to their menu and make it available to their customers without reinventing the wheel.""  A risky business  The payments industry in the adult entertainment market is particularly challenging, thanks to the relatively high rate of fraud. Stolen credit cards are often used on adult sites by thieves eager to verify their usability by making small purchases. However, this isn't the only threat; chargebacks, issued by adult website users with buyer's remorse who cancel their payments, are another challenge.  Bitcoin can help payment processors to avoid chargeback problems, because it doesn't allow users to renege on payments. Once bitcoins have been sent, it is impossible to retrieve them without the recipient's consent.  Bitcoin may also reduce a customer's motivation to revert a credit card payment, because unlike credit card payments, information about the purchase is not sent to a customer's house on a statement. This increases the privacy for adult entertainment customers paying with the digital currency.  However, bitcoin also lacks a key feature traditionally valued by the adult entertainment industry: recurring billing. Many adult entertainment providers make their money by offering memberships, which are charged regularly to credit cards. ""Recurring payments are currently not possible with bitcoin, because you can't pull money from someone's bitcoin address,"" said Gallippi. This means that customers would have to pay manually for the content.  Estimates of the porn industry’s size vary, but Juniper Research figures have suggested that the global market for adult material on mobile devices alone would reach $2.8bn by next year, with subscriptions accounting for $1bn.
