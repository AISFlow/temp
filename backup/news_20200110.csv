His statements would appear to conflict with a letter sent to LedgerX's board and the CFTC Office of the Inspector General by a member of its board of directors. In the letter, Nicholas Owen Gunden wrote that as an investor, he had received limited communications from the company, and was concerned about its operations.      LedgerX also announced that it closed a ""significant"" financing round ""led by the company's largest investors including Digital Finance Group."" The amount raised was not disclosed, but the funds will be used to bring on more senior executives, the release said.

42383176,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uNv3,1578692425,SEC Produces Evidence That Telegram Kept Selling Tokens After $1.7B ICO,"At least two entities invoiced Telegram for commissions from selling the company's tokens in the summer of 2018, months after the company's initial coin offering (ICO), newly released documents show.       The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which filed the documents Friday in its ongoing court case against Telegram, said the evidence of post-ICO sales undercuts the company's argument that the offering was exempt from registration requirements.      Investment fund Da Vinci Capital and another entity called Gem Limited requested commissions of $209,783 and $1.1 million, respectively, for ""subsequent sales"" of purchase agreements for grams, the future tokens for Telegram's blockchain project TON, the filings show.      According to the invoices presented by the SEC, Da Vinci Capital sold over $2 million worth of grams to a fund managed by its portfolio company, ITI Funds, on June 20, 2018. Gem Limited sold 7.8 million euros ($8.6 million) worth of grams to a firm named Goliat Solutions and $4.5 million to Space Investments Limited on July 2, 2018.      Both sales took place after the offering of grams, which Telegram maintains was exempt from registration under Regulation D, was completed in February and March 2018.      Da Vinci Capital’s investment director Denis Efremov declined to comment. Gem Limited was unavailable for comment at press time.      The filings joined a massive trove of documents the SEC has submitted to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York to support its allegation that grams were illegally sold as unregistered securities, which Telegram has denied.       ""These documents undermine Telegram’s claimed affirmative defense that the Offering was exempt under Regulation D. First, Telegram either raised more than the $1.7 billion for which it claimed an exemption, or it did not raise $1.7 billion as of March 29, 2018 and the later funds may have been raised through underwriters,"" an earlier SEC filing said, referring to the invoices.      The SEC’s argument is that under Regulation D, the issuer should take reasonable steps to ensure the purchasers don’t act as statutory underwriters (i.e. aren’t selling securities for the issuer for commissions), said Philip Moustakis, a counsel at Seward & Kissel and former senior counsel at the SEC.      In this case, the regulator is saying the companies that invoiced Telegram did exactly that, while Telegram argues that the commissions were finders' fees to non-U.S. persons and entities for introducing grams to other investors, Moustakis said.      Telegram raised $1.7 billion in the pre-sale of future tokens of the TON project in February and March 2018. The purchase agreement prohibited investors from reselling their grams, but a secondary market emerged soon anyway. However, there were previously no public indications of Telegram’s approval of the later sales.       The SEC sued Telegram in October, ordering it to halt the launch of TON. The regulator is set to meet Telegram in court on Feb 18-19.      In the meantime, the SEC requested full banking records of Telegram regarding the token sale proceeds. On Jan. 9, Telegram asked the judge to grant the company five to seven weeks to prepare the documents to avoid privacy infringement.",NEGATIVE,TON,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TON | TOKEN SALE,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/01/10/sec-produces-evidence-that-telegram-kept-selling-tokens-after-17b-ico,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/22a252d7ce6d4fb476e2cb28fa92122d91f7637d-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383178,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uNtn,1578690979,PwC Switzerland Incorporates ChainSecurity Team to Expand Blockchain Audit Tools,"PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Switzerland has brought in smart contract audit firm ChainSecurity, folding the company's technology and its expertise into the Big Four accounting firm, the companies announced earlier this week.      In what seems like an acquisition in all but name, the seven technical engineers are joining the accounting firm to bolster PwC Switzerland’s smart contract audit abilities.      After being spun out of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETH Zürich) in October 2017, ChainSecurity has conducted more than 75 smart contract and blockchain audits globally and has had a long relationship with PwC Switzerland -- the company in the PwC network used by the Tezos Foundation for its external audit. Last year, ChainSecurity discovered an issue that delayed the Constantinople hard fork and issues with the Istanbul hard fork.      The team will continue to collaborate with the federal institute and work with its new employer to upgrade PwC Switzerland’s tools and make them more compatible with formal verification, or the mathematical proofs that test mission-critical source code to ensure it operates as programmers intended.      “For smart contracts in general, one can say that they represent modern business logic for companies,” said Hubert Ritzdorf, former chief technology officer at ChainSecurity and technical lead for smart contract assurance at PwC Switzerland. “If a stablecoin has a bug, you could create coins that are not properly backed by collateral.”      While formal verification was part of the team’s product suite before joining PwC, Ritzdorf and his colleagues plan to expand their offerings in the next generation of their products.      Usually tools that employ formal verification are used in high-risk industries like airplane engineering and space travel where organizations including Boeing or NASA use them, Ritzdorf added. In the crypto industry, where money is represented by digital units and dictated by code, traditional firms and start-ups are using formal verification to ensure it’s very unlikely that users can spend what they don’t have or lose what they do have.      The players in crypto that seek formal verification tend to be more serious, such as companies dealing with decentralized finance or stablecoins, said Daryl Hok, chief operating officer of blockchain cybersecurity company CertiK. The Libra Association also plans to create automated formal verification for its programming language, Move.      “We’re seeing more and more projects seeking out the rigor that formal verification provides,” Hok said. “Those are usually self-selecting and tend to be the most equipped teams and have enough capital to do these things.”      The clients that come to PwC Switzerland for blockchain audits tend to be majority enterprises from banking, manufacturing and trading, said Andreas Eschbach, partner and leader of risk assurance for PwC Switzerland and Europe.      “It has grown out of the startups and is becoming popular among companies that have been around 80 years plus,” Eschbach said.       With the legal expertise of PwC, the ChainSecurity team can go further than it was able to before in its analysis of smart contracts.      “The compliance step was always hard for us to do,” Ritzdorf said. “We just wrote down technically what the smart contract does and had to go to a law firm to check if it was legally compliant.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | FORKS,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/10/pwc-switzerland-incorporates-chainsecurity-team-to-expand-blockchain-audit-tools,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3680cdd8f51f4b32aebfbe84392056fa7e6f20c4-1000x664.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383179,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uNxZ,1578685212,SEC Seeks $16M From ICOBox for Unregistered Token Sale,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is seeking more than $16 million in penalties from ICOBox for selling ""ICOS"" tokens as unregistered securities.      According to a filing in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, the SEC seeks a default judgment against Cayman Islands-based ICOBox and founder and CEO Nikolay Evdokimov, asking the judge to approve penalties as well as a lifetime ban from marketing or selling securities in the U.S.      The regulator also wants Evdokimov to pay a separate civil penalty of just under $190,000.      The SEC brought charges against ICOBox in September, claiming it had breached securities laws by selling ICOS tokens to investors without first registering with the regulator. The token sale had raised a total of $14.6 million from approximately 2,000 unaccredited investors in 2017.      The complaint alleges Evdokimov had promised ICOS would appreciate in value as projects started using ICOBox to host token sales. The original filing claims the company acted as an unregistered securities broker by facilitating 30 token sales that raised a collective $650 million.      The SEC originally warned projects in 2017 it would treat ICOs as unregistered securities sales. In November 2018 the regulator charged projects Airfox and Paragon with violating securities sale registration requirements. Crypto startup Gladius Network announced in November it was closing its operations after settling charges with the regulator and refunding investors $12.7 million.      The SEC filed its motion to the federal court for a default judgment that, if granted, would force ICOBox and Evdokimov to pay the penalties to the SEC in 14 days.

Transcript:      Adam B. Levine: On today’s episode, our news roundup, the first tokenized pro basketball player, and Fidelity’s 2019 bitcoin reflections.      Adam: It’s JANUARY 10, 2020, and you’re listening to Markets Daily, I’m Adam B. Levine, editor of Podcasts here at CoinDesk, along with our senior markets reporter, Brad Keoun, to give you a concise daily briefing on crypto markets and some of the most important news developments in the sector over the past 24 hours.      Brad: Bitcoin up slightly today after two straight day of losses, currently around $7,900.      CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reporting the market is seeing price resistance around the psychological level of $8,000, and technical indicators are looking a bit more bearish than earlier in the week      Adam: Turning to the news, today marks the deadline for crypto exchanges and custodians to adopt tough new anti-money laundering rules.      CoinDesk’s Ian Allison notes that this could be a double-edged sword for the industry, driving up compliance costs and perhaps pushing away some customers, but potentially engendering more trust and confidence in cryptocurrencies among European banks and investors.      Brad: And in what appears to be a related development, the Dutch crypto-derivatives exchange Deribit announced it will move its headquarters to Panama to escape tough new industry rules coming from European regulators.      According to Deribit officials, new anti-money-laundering rules would require customers to provide an extensive amount of information, which makes the barriers to entry for the majority of traders too high, both from a regulatory and cost perspective.      Deribit officials wrote in a blog post that they think crypto markets should be freely available to most.      Adam: And Tether appears to have received a minor reprieve in court, at least on one front.      Plaintiffs have withdrawn a class-action lawsuit filed in November in Washington state that accused Tether and its affiliated Bitfinex exchange of issuing inaccurate information and monopolizing the bitcoin market.      UPDATE: The suit was re-filed in the Southern District of New York a day later with an additional plaintiff. The article has been updated.      Bitfinex had denied the accusation, saying it would contest any nuisance settlements      A Bitfinex spokesman declined to comment on the latest development      Brad: A new report from the cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Labs says that North Korean hackers are now using the messaging app Telegram to steal crypto      According to the report, the Lazarus Group, a cybercrime group with links to North Korea, uses Telegram to deliver malware that gets downloaded on a victim’s computer and then sends sensitive data to hackers      Channels then direct users to fake cryptocurrency companies      Adam: In Russia, a government-owned nuclear power plant is now renting out space to crypto miners      The Rosatom State Atomic Energy Corporation has opened a crypto mining farm near a nuclear plant some 200 miles northwest of Moscow.      The government entitty won’t mine bitcoin for its own account, but it will sell electricity to heavy users and reng space for their equipment      Brad: And our final story today is a real stinker      A Luxembourg-based company announced this week that it will launch a cryptocurrency backed by sardines      CoinDesk found a booth run by the company MY Sardines at this week’s CES 2020 consumer electronics show in Las Vegas      The company says it’s working with a French sardine supplier called Pearl of the Gods      The company will purchase the sardine tins in September and then use the ethereum blockchain to distribute digital tokens that can be redeemed for the sardine cans at any time in the next 10 years      And you thought that Tether story smelled fishy, Adam      Adam: Turning to todays featured story, 26 year old NBA guard Spencer Dinwiddie is launching what we think is the first tokenized security offering tied to a NBA star      In October, Coindesk Reported:    Accredited investors can soon indulge their hoop dreams.In partnership with crypto firm Paxos, NBA guard Spencer Dinwiddie is looking to raise $13.5 million by tokenizing the first year of his three-year, $34.5 million contract.Dubbed the DREAM Fan Shares platform, investors in the securities offering will earn interest through Dinwiddie’s bi-monthly paycheck. The minimum buy-in is $150,000.The guard for the Brooklyn Nets told CoinDesk that his contract is fully guaranteed, meaning investors do not risk losing their funds if he is injured or otherwise unable to play. He is set to earn $16 million this season, trading $2.5 million in earnings for the certainty of an upfront payment.”CoinDesk    After his plan met resistance from the National Basketball Association, the project underwent a number of changes which for the most part simplified it. The Atheletic reported:    “Several obstacles emerged from the NBA’s perspective in its discussions with Dinwiddie — such as believing his plan was a “third-party assignment” and his third-year player option worth $12.3 million being an issue and violating anti-gambling rules.Dinwiddie maintained that his player option is simply a performance-based incentive that has been tied to thousands of players — not a gambling angle — and that his investment vehicle actually encourages him to play as much as possible and perform well. So Dinwiddie edited his investment vehicle again, and instead of tying investors to his basketball-related income that option year, it would simply be a flat bond with no performance incentives. The NBA came away from meeting with Dinwiddie that his career and the Nets are his primary priorities.”TheAthletic.com    Forbes reports on the details of the token being launched Monday:    “Dinwiddie is going to sell 90 securities-backed SD8 tokens, which can’t be traded for a year, for $150,000 apiece to verified accredited investors under SEC Regulation D, Rule 506 (c). What he created, he said, allows players to structure and issue debt instruments in digital token form to invest their money how they’d like. It would function as a decentralization of a personal loan to athletes through bonds they create with their guaranteed contracts as collateral.The SD8 coin will be a three-year bond expected to pay out 4.95% base interest on a monthly basis— much better than you’d be able to get at a bank— with the full principal paid out at the end of the period upon maturity in a bullet payment. The investment period will begin on Monday (January 13th) and end on Feb. 10, with the bond notes maturing and paying out in full on Feb. 10, 2023. According to a chart provided by Dinwiddie’s representatives, if all 90 coins were purchased, it would net investors just over $2 million over the course of the three years.”Forbes.com    What was a fringe idea even just two years ago is on the verge of going mainstream, and the NBA doesn’t even seem that concerned.      Even if you’re not a sports fan, this is exciting. The conversation around these sorts of celebrity tokenizations started way back in 2014 and it’s taken us six years, more than half the time since bitcoin launched to get to this first real test of the concept. And to be clear, it’s definitely not what we envisioned in those early days as the weight of organizational momentum at the NBA and government security requirements from the SEC squeeze the idea into something which only the richest among us can participate in, and even then only a maximum of 90 individuals can possibly own one of these tokens.

Adam: And now, for today’s spotlight, we’re looking at the giant U.S. money manager Fidelity’s reflections on bitcoin in 2019, and what appears to have been a banner year for the world’s oldest and largest cryptocurrency      Brad: Among large U.S. financial institutions, the giant money manager Fidelity has probably been the most publicly committed to crypto assets, jumping in with both feet while most banks and other firms await clarity on industry rules from regulators      And of course Fidelity has been a leader for a couple decades in the money management industry;      The boston-based company, led by Abby Johnson, one of the world’s richest women, now manages about $2.5 trillion for clients, and administers another $4 trillion or so for its customers      Well Ria Bhutoria is director of research for the firm’s crypto unit, Fidelity Digital Assets, and she published a long blog post Thursday outlining her reflections on bitcoin for 2019      She writes that in just a few years, bitcoin’s story has evolved criticially to recognize what she calls the true potential of its network - a new type of value transfer system, a tool for freedom, a savings technology and possibly more uses that we have yet to discover      Its potential cannot be ignored, she says      She notes that trading and investment on incumbent, regulated platforms is growing      Key performance indicators like hash rate are improving      And cumulative miner revenue surpassed $15 billion      She cites the introduction of futures contracts that can be settled via delivery of bitcoin as a major step forward      One exchange, Bakkt, introduced options trading in December, and the rival exchange CME is set to follow with its own options menu starting on Monday      It’s also noteworthy that the popular merchant payment app Square has openly embraced bitcoin, especially with the support of CEO Jack Dorsey, who also has invested in Lightning Labs, which is working to develop key parts of the infrastructure of fast-growing crypto markets      New large-scale bitcoin-mining operations are coming online, attracting millions of dollars of capital from deep-pocketed investors, she notes      Bhutoria concludes by saying that bitcoin continues to boast a dominant position in the crypto market, with growing usage and adoption      She adds that bitcoin has ""unapologetically maintained its core properties as a border-less, censorship and seizure resistant, decentralized value storage and transfer system""      In short, Adam, these are all positive signs for bitcoin in her opinion, and she sees increasing adoption over the coming year, with continuing maturation of the network and its infrastructure",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,"Adam B.

42383190,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uOBP,1578675007,This Metric Suggests Bitcoin Has Bottomed Out,"Bitcoin likely carved out a major price bottom in December, according to a non-price metric, which has proved to be a reliable price indicator in the past.       The leading cryptocurrency is currently trading above $7,700, having hit eight-month lows below $6,500 in mid-December. While the bounce is encouraging, the cryptocurrency remains trapped in a six-month-long bearish channel. Thus, the technical bias is still bearish.       However, bitcoin’s difficulty adjustment – a measure of how difficult it is to find blocks on the blockchain – indicates the bear market, which began at highs above $13,800 in June 2019, may have bottomed out near $6,500 in December.       The mining difficulty fell from 13.7 trillion in November to 13 trillion in December – the first downward adjustment in 12 months – according to data source data.bitcoinity.org.       Historically, negative monthly difficulty adjustments have marked major price bottoms, according to popular analyst “Nunya Bizniz.”       For instance, the sell-off from the record high just shy of $20,000 seen in December 2017 ran out of steam near $3,100 in December 2018 with the consecutive monthly downward difficulty adjustments at the end of 2018, as seen below (red lines).       Going further back, the difficulty dropped from 0.0494 trillion (49.4 giga) in April 2015 to 0.0488 trillion (48.8 giga) in May 2015. Interestingly, bitcoin’s decline from the December 2013 high of $1,153 bottomed out around $200 in April-May 2015.       The cryptocurrency traded in a sideways manner for a couple of months before beginning an ascent in October 2015. The peculiar behavior could be explained by monthly declines in difficulty caused by miner capitulation.       Note that mining difficulty is adjusted higher or lower every two weeks in correspondence with the amount of the computational power (hash rate) dedicated to mining. The latter is dependent on mining profitability, which is heavily influenced by price.       Thus, a monthly mining difficulty decrease is essentially the result of a slide in the hash rate caused by small and marginal miners shutting down operations during sustained market sell-offs and dwindling mining profitability.       What’s more, while shutting down operations miners often sell their coins at market price in order to recoup mining losses, accentuating the sell-off. Only when the supply from these miners is absorbed do selling pressures weaken and the cryptocurrency finds a bottom.       Meanwhile, remaining miners tend to hold their coins and sell later for profit when prices increase, further decreasing supply in the short term and driving the cryptocurrency higher, Alex Benfield, data analyst at Digital Assets Data told CoinDesk.       Also, mining difficulty decreases happen a few months before reward halvings – a process aimed at curbing inflation by cutting rewards per block mined in half every four years.       “Reward halvings increase the scarcity of bitcoin,” said Banfield.       So, miners who sustained the bear market likely anticipated a price rise on reward halving and held their coins, creating a supply shortage in the short term and driving prices higher.     History repeating itself    Bitcoin’s 17.48 percent drop in November was caused by miner capitulation, according to market analyst Willy Woo.       The argument may have merit because bitcoin fell from $13,800 to $7,500 in three months to September. Such a price drop may have hurt weak miners, forcing capitulation.       Interestingly, selling pressures has also ebbed in the last four weeks.       Also, the latest downward adjustment in the difficulty happened five months ahead of the reward halving. Therefore, big miners could create a supply shortage in the short term, lifting prices higher.       All in all, there is a strong reason to believe bitcoin bottomed out in December with the downward adjustment in difficulty and could regain poise over the coming months.       Even so, investors need to observe caution, as noted by Gabor Gurbacs, digital asset strategist and director at VanEck/MVIS. After all, there are additional factors like tax cycles, regulatory actions, cyber security events and derivative expirations that could influence prices significantly.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/10/this-metric-suggests-bitcoin-has-bottomed-out,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f7a60843cf6ed5c40c07467e89125a89c662bb90-1198x741.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Nicholas Owen Gunden wrote in a letter addressed to the LedgerX Holdings board, LedgerX LLC board, LedgerX shareholders, and the Office of the Inspector General at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) that he was concerned about how the bitcoin derivatives provider was operating since the company’s founders were placed on administrative leave on Dec. 9.      “I am concerned with recent developments at the company, particularly the fact and manner in which the founders, Paul Chou and Juthica Chou, and particularly Juthica, have been barred from continuing their roles at the company,” he wrote.      According to an exhibit filed by LedgerX in its designated contract market (DCM) application, Gunden has been a board member since 2017 as a market participant, and was on the company’s disciplinary panel as of last year.      In a three-page list of concerns, he explained that since the founders were ousted, no one has acted as his point of contact and alleged that some shareholders appeared to be receiving preferential treatment.      “Just days after Paul and Juthica were placed on administrative leave, a petition was circulated at the office, which 75% of employees signed in support of retaining Paul and Juthica’s leadership. I have seen a copy of this petition and believe it to be legitimate,” he wrote.      However, two of the employees who filed the petition were fired, “apparently in retaliation,” he alleged.      He is also concerned that LedgerX may no longer be compliant with regulatory requirements and may be failing in its fiduciary duties.      LedgerX board member Mark Wetjen did not immediately return a request for comment.    Questionable firing    In his letter, Gunden suggested that Juthica Chou’s suspension from her roles as chief financial and risk officer of the company may be posing more harm than good to LedgerX.      He detailed the meeting the board held to suspend Juthica and her husband Paul, saying “an extreme and one-sided case” was presented against the two, but there was no opportunity for defense.      “While a case can be made against Paul due to his recent external communications, no comparable case can be made against Juthica, and yet she is being removed as well in spite of being the best suited candidate for CEO,” he said.      He appears to be referencing Tweets and possibly letters written by Paul Chou alleging wrongdoing on the part of the CFTC after the company was not allowed to launch physically-settled bitcoin futures contracts last year.      “Just days after Paul and Juthica were placed on administrative leave, a petition was circulated at the office, which 75% of employees signed in support of retaining Paul and Juthica’s leadership. I have seen a copy of this petition and believe it to be legitimate,” he wrote.      However, two of the employees who filed the petition were fired, “apparently in retaliation,” Gunden alleged.      Shareholder letters “outlining concerns” with the interim management had been ignored, and while some minority investors in the company have expressed interest in backing the company further, this is contingent upon Juthica Chou being named the new CEO.    Attempted takeover?    Gunden expressed concerns that Miami International Holdings (MIAX), one shareholder in the company, might be attempting to take over the company, or at least acquire its regulatory licenses.      Gunden said MIAX was the only shareholder invited to attend and participate in certain private board meetings, which he found problematic. Aside from board members, no other shareholders were present.      Further, he alleged that a Holdings board member may be accepting “payouts for helping MIAX to complete an insider funding round.”      LedgerX CFO Jennifer Liu has been kept in the dark regarding the Holdings board’s actions, he added (Liu did not immediately return CoinDesk’s request for comment).      Other concerns include that the Holdings board presented “overly pessimistic” financial statements to the board of directors; that the company does not appear to be trying to raise funds outside of MIAX; and that the company is spending an extra $60,000 per month by hiring a security company.      “From what I can tell, the Holdings board is engaged in grossly negligent actions towards LedgerX market participants, employees, shareholders, and perhaps even CFTC compliance requirements themselves,” he wrote.      As such, many staffers are expecting the worst, Gunden wrote: “I have spoken with two current employees and learned that there is a lot of confusion and uncertainty at the company, and I’ve received reports that many employees are interviewing elsewhere in anticipation of the company shutting down.”      Read the full letter below:      UPDATE (Jan. 10, 18:45 UTC): This article has been updated with additional information, including the full letter.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | MARKET | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/10/ledgerx-board-member-says-company-in-disarray-after-founders-ouster,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7f770e98bc9bbee5383516e7b45f5cf710222039-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

First reported by The Athletic, Dinwiddie will issue shares tied to his contract beginning Jan. 13, months after the NBA pushed back on his plan to create a tokenization platform for entertainers to essentially issue debt instruments based on their future earnings.      Dinwiddie announced last year that he would tokenize his three-year, $34.5 million contract on the ethereum blockchain, looking to raise $13.5 million for the first year. Essentially, he’d raise his contract’s value as an upfront lump sum, with token holders receiving payouts throughout the season.      The basketball league said in September that Dinwiddie’s plan was barred under the collective bargaining agreement under which NBA players operate. According to Forbes, the specific point of contention was the potential for Dinwiddie to execute an option on the third year of his contract, promising “significant dividends for investors” if he indeed opted out and signed a higher-paying contract.      Dinwiddie told Forbes that removing this clause and offering a flat bond instead would allow the plan to proceed. Accredited investors will be able to purchase tokens for a minimum $150,000 buy-in, giving him his contract’s value up front.      Paxos Trust Company will provide escrow services and facilitate payouts to token holders using its dollar-pegged PAX stablecoin. Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo said on Twitter Friday that his firm would act as the transfer agent and technology partner for the project.      Spokespeople for Dinwiddie and Paxos did not immediately return CoinDesk's requests for comment. However, Dinwiddie tweeted Friday that “the Spencer Dinwiddie bond launches January 13th.”      The NBA said in a statement the league was reviewing the modified plan, indicating it may not have actually given Dinwiddie the sign-off to go live on Monday as he intends.

A fan of gold and bling could identify as a crypto investor, while a fan of Disney will strap on a Mickey Mouse watch.      Now a company called Watch Skins wants to turn digital wearables into new ways to express yourself – and let you own a piece of unique digital property too.      The company, founded by brothers Colin and Justin Knock along with creative director Seth Cheshire, has created a platform for creating, buying and selling watch faces based on non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The product is currently in its early phase,but the team showed us an early version including an auction app that lets you bid on and buy popular watch faces.      The key to the product is the idea of non-fungibility or digital scarcity. The team has created a wide collection of face designs and is also working with brands and artists to produce others featuring logos, sports players, cartoons and street art. Their platform is working, but is currently in beta.      Each watch face is unique and no other user can own the same one. Because they are collectibles, the Knocks expect the faces to fluctuate in price based on demand.      ""I’ve always been a watch lover. I've collected them for years, and when it came to my smartwatch I realized that there was no real scarcity or rarity in the digital watch face market. I wanted something unique that I could design myself. When I couldn’t find it in the marketplace, I decided to build it myself,"" Colin told CoinDesk at CES in Las Vegas as he walked us through the platform.

A statement from Bitfinex general counsel Stuart Hoegner has also been added.      A class-action lawsuit alleging Tether and Bitfinex manipulated the bitcoin market has been withdrawn by the plaintiffs and re-filed with a new plaintiff in a different jurisdiction.      A document filed Jan. 7 in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington shows plaintiffs Eric Young and Adam Kurtz opted for voluntary dismissal of their case against Tether and Bitfinex's parent firm iFinex. The case was originally filed on Nov. 22, 2019.      The following day, it was re-filed in the Southern District of New York with the addition of plaintiff David Crystal.      The plaintiffs, who both claimed to be bitcoin traders, alleged Bitfinex and Tether issued inaccurate information and ""monopolized and conspired to monopolize the bitcoin market."" Drawing heavily on the case brought by New York's attorney general last April, they also accused the defendants of manipulating the market by printing unbacked tethers.      ""When bitcoin prices were falling, Defendants and their co-conspirators printed USD₮s and artificially increased the price of bitcoin,"" reads the original filing. ""Once Defendants and their co-conspirators artificially inflated the price of bitcoin, Defendants and their co-conspirators then converted the bitcoin back into USD₮s to replenish Tether's reserves.""      Bitfinex has previously denied the accusations, describing the case as ""mercenary and baseless,"" stating it would contest any ""nuisance settlements"".      In a statement Friday, Stuart Hoegner, general counsel to Bitfinex, said: ""Apparently the plaintiffs have determined that their action should be filed in the Southern District of New York, which raises the question of why it was filed in Washington State in the first place. Whether this complaint is filed in Washington State or the Southern District of New York, it remains entirely meritless and will be disposed of in due course.""      It isn't yet known why the plaintiffs decided to re-file the case. According to U.S. law, cases that have already been voluntarily dismissed can never be brought before the court again if dismissed for a second time.      In November, Tether published a letter of intent to file a motion to dismiss another separate class action that seeks retribution for manipulating the bitcoin price, claiming damages of more than $1 trillion. The letter, released more than a month after the lawsuit was originally filed, claimed plaintiffs were unable to prove Tether or Bitfinex's involvement.      While the dismissal document is not signed by the judge, the case has now been marked as terminated on Pacer, the U.S. court filings portal.

42403774,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgk5J,1578657600,US Lawmakers Call on Communications Regulator to Tackle SIM-Swapping Crime,"Democrats in the U.S. Congress are demanding the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) takes action to tackle the rise in SIM swapping attacks.      Responding to the groundswell of reported SIM swap heists, senators Ron Wyden (Ore.), Sherrod Brown (Ohio) and Ed Markey (Mass.) and representatives Ted Lieu (Calif.), Anna Eshoo (Calif.) and Yvette Clarke (N.Y.) sent FCC Chairman Ajit Pai a letter Thursday urging him to do more to hold cell carriers accountable for the low-cost but often highly lucrative crime.      Cybersecurity blog KrebsOnSecurity first reported the letter.      SIM-swapping is the act of remotely accessing a target’s cellular identity, essentially co-opting the associated phone number for nefarious purposes. There’s any number of ways to swap a SIM; in some cases, hackers even bribe or exploit cell carrier employees.      Once the number is taken over, the fraudster can reset victims’ passwords, steal credentials and wipe personal information, bypassing most security mechanisms that rely on cellular two-factor authentication. That can be costly, especially for a crypto community still largely reliant on text-based account security. To date, millions of dollars in crypto have been stolen in alleged SIM swap attacks.      The lawmakers' chief concern appears to be America’s lack of comprehensive consumer protection policies. They note that some jurisdictions require prevention methods, like in-store verification, while others lag behind.      “Implementation of these additional security measures by wireless carriers in the U.S. is still spotty and consumers are unlikely to find out about the availability of these obscure, optional security features until it is too late,"" the lawmakers wrote.      They also demanded to know more about how the FCC tracks SIM swap reports, if it has been educating the public on prevention and if it has investigated such hacks in the past.      One of the most public victims of an attack was crypto investor and communications executive Michael Terpin, who lost over $20 million to SIM-swappers in 2018. He sued his cell provider, AT&T, for failing to protect him, alleging the company was responsible for its employees who allegedly worked with the fraudsters.      That suit is ongoing. Terpin also wrote FCC’s Pai, in October, urging action against SIM swapping.      Last month, prosecutors unsealed an indictment against Nicholas Truglia, who is suspected of orchestrating the Terpin heist.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | REGULATION,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/01/10/us-lawmakers-call-on-communications-regulator-to-tackle-sim-swapping-crime,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cc504e9efa524557562eaecae7f812723770d22f-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403784,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgkBD,1578654034,Bitcoin Retraces 45 Percent of Recent Price Gains as Bulls Lose Momentum,"View  Bitcoin continues to lose altitude and risks falling to crucial support near $7,555.  A UTC close below that level would invalidate an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout confirmed on Jan. 6.  However, the pullback was based on low volumes and could be reversed.  A move above $8,000 would imply an end of the price pullback and open the doors for a re-test of the recent high of $8,463.    Bitcoin is flashing red for the third straight day, with a major portion of the recent price gains now erased.      After a drop back to below $7,800, the cryptocurrency has erased nearly 45 percent of the rise from $6,850 to $8,463 witnessed in the six days to Jan. 8, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      At press time, the biggest cryptocurrency by market value is currently changing hands near $7,757, representing a 1.5 percent drop from the day's opening price (UTC) of $7,875. Bitcoin shed 1.4 percent and 2.9 percent on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.      The cryptocurrency did show signs of life with a move higher from $7,780 to $8,000 during the early U.S. trading hours on Thursday. However, the bulls lost momentum near the $8,000 psychological resistance and the minor bounce was quickly reversed.      The rejection likely invited stronger selling pressure, yielding a drop to a low of $7,676 earlier today.      Looking forward, a deeper drop to key support below $7,600 cannot be ruled out.    Hourly chart    Bitcoin has dived out of an ascending trendline on the hourly chart, violating the bullish higher -lows pattern.      Further, it has found acceptance under the widely-tracked 100-hour average, with the relative strength index (RSI) reporting bearish conditions below 50.    Daily chart    Bitcoin created a spinning top candle on Wednesday, signaling indecision in the market place.      That ended with bears coming out victorious, as indicated by Thursday's 2.9 percent drop.      Put simply, the odds of a slide to $7,555 – a former hurdle-turned-support of the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline – have increased over the last 24 hours.      The breakout, however, would be invalidated only if BTC prints a UTC close above $7,555.    Low-volume pullback    As seen on the four-hour chart, selling volumes, as represented by the red bars, have dropped throughout the pullback from $8,463 to $7,700.      A low-volume pullback is often short-lived. Hence, the bears need to observe caution despite signs of weakness in the hourly and daily charts.      A move above $8,000, a level that acted as a strong hurdle on Thursday, will imply an end of the pullback and will likely yield a re-test of recent highs above $8,400.

The new rules require crypto exchanges and custodial service providers to register with their local regulator and demonstrate compliance with thoroughgoing know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering AML procedures.      In addition to the enhanced KYC and reporting obligations, the regime gives greater power and reach to financial intelligence units and law enforcement.      These regulations represent a double-edged sword for the industry. On the one hand, the added costs of compliance may burden smaller firms in the field, and possibly force some to fold or merge.      “This will result in some closures and there are some early indications of that already, and in consolidation, where the industry starts to see M&A to scale up and meet increased costs,” said Siân Jones, director, xReg Consulting.      Already, Deribit, a Netherlands-based crypto derivatives exchange, is planning to relocate to Panama because its home country's version of AMLD5 ""would put too-high barriers for the majority of traders, both regulatory and cost-wise,"" the company said Thursday.      A good deal of complexity also remains over how AMLD5 will be implemented and operated from one European country to the next.      On the plus side, the long-term effect should be greater trust in crypto from financial institutions in Europe. In particular, it should make banks more open to providing their services to crypto companies and attract more institutional capital.      “It’s part of a global trend to bring crypto in line with traditional finance; crypto is part of the global financial system, even if it doesn’t realize it yet,” Jones said.    Crypto complexity    Dispensing legislation over the EU’s 28 member states can be a lengthy and protracted business. As it stands, the accepted norms of traditional finance don’t map on to the crypto world.      While something like an emoney license in one European country can be passported into another, the AML authorization schemes regarding crypto vary across Europe; France has one approach, Germany another, the Netherlands is different again and so on.      This adds a layer of complexity when it comes to registration or authorization under AMLD5, said Malcolm Wright, head of the AML Working Group at the trade group Global Digital Finance. And if you happen to be in the U.K., Brexit throws yet another spanner in the works.      Firms may need to just do authorization or may need to do a full license or may not need to do anything, said Wright, who is also chief compliance officer at Diginex, a Hong Kong-based firm offering institutional-grade infrastructure for digital assets.      “There almost needs to be a more coordinated approach to make sure it allows the industry to still flourish and offer services to residents in the EU who want to invest in virtual assets products,” he said.      In the U.K., crypto firms will need to register with the local regulator, which is the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The consultation on the proposed cost of the registration pitched fees at £5,000 (about $6,500), with an annual fee yet to be decided upon. Firms will have until Oct. 20 to carry out the registration process.    FATF effect    AMLD5 has been on the cards for a couple of years now and to some extent has been superseded by recommendations from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), first made in October 2018 and then updated in June 2019.      Where AMLD5 covers only cash to crypto transactions and vice-versa, the guidance from FATF, an international body with 39 member countries, also includes crypto-to-crypto exchanges.      Most significantly, it recommends applying payment data-sharing requirements from the traditional world to crypto, the so-called “travel rule.”      “We are seeing some member states going beyond AMLD5 and now including these wider FATF requirements, and I think that is an example, if you like, of where other events overtake some of the slow processes of bringing in EU legislation,” said Jones, citing the U.K. as an example.      “I think these FATF requirements will have a much more significant impact on crypto businesses. What might have been, to begin with, the EU taking the lead, the FATF requirements go beyond and apply globally,” she said.    Non-custodial wallets    One area of concern is the way in which an extra-restrictive implementation of AMLD5 might catch firms that provide non-custodial wallets on a completely decentralized basis.      This is something the U.K. and Germany were threatening to do, said Jacqui Hatfield, partner and head of Fintech Regulatory in the London offices of Orrick, Herrington and Sutcliffe LLP.      This would inappropriately include firms like ethereum-based finance platform TokenCard (which recently rebranded as Monolith) and crypto payment card provider Wirex, said Hatfield.      “Basically, they are not a custodian; they are providing the wallet facility but it's on an open basis so they are not responsible for it. It's actually very difficult for them to comply with this if they are not the ones who are in control of those wallets,” she said.      The FCA did not return requests for comment by press time.      “I have clients who think that the FCA is not going to go ahead with it, but no one at the FCA has actually confirmed that that is going to be the case,” said Hatfield. “I think it's partly about being happy to gold-plate the regs and also just that they don't really understand the tech.”    Dutch deadline    A disagreement has broken out over the definition of the term “license” in the Netherlands, where critics of the Dutch Ministry of Finance and central bank believe a disproportionately onerous version of AMLD5 is being handed down to crypto players.      Banking compliance consultant Simon Lelieveldt said the legislation is delayed because of a “serious disagreement between legislators and industry,” and that the Jan. 10 deadline will be missed in Holland.      The law is now in the Senate for discussion and this could take until the end of February or even later, he said.      “The Dutch Ministry of Finance and central bank have topped up the regular AMLD5 rules with two provisions from the financial supervision law book, which are generic umbrella clauses, allowing all kinds of investigations and measures,” said Lelieveldt.      “This [goes] against the explicit advice of the Council of State and against the text and spirit of the AMLD5 itself,” he said. “The Ministry misinformed the House of Representatives on the true nature of the law and played a word trick: by replacing the previous word ‘license’ for ‘registration’ they claim it is no longer a licensing regime.”      The European Commission’s digital innovation spokesman did not return requests for comment by press time.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/01/10/european-crypto-firms-brace-for-higher-costs-as-amld5-takes-effect,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1c9415f4b40ebf5219ba6a7e7bce9d0e97b68d52-1200x1049.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
